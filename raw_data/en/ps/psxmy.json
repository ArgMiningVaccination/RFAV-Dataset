Members Absent: none MD, , Kim Wentz, MD , MPH (by phone) , Bruce Austin, DMD, and Brian Nieubuurt (Oregon Health Authority) ; Megan Bird, MD (Legacy Health ); Karen Campbell and Jane Stephen (Allergan ); Katie Noah (Willamette Dental ); Jeanne Stagner (Klamath's Women's Center ); Amy Rainbow (Birth Network National ); Cour tney Johnson (COHO ); Karen Nolon (ODS ); Neola Young and Emily McCan (Basic Rights Oregon ); Amy Penkin, LSCW and Erica Pettigrew, MD ( OHSU ); Carl (Care Oregon ); Pau Nielsen (Allermes ); Sharron Fuchs; Carole ). Roll Call/Minutes Approval/Staff Report The meeting was called to order at 8:45 am and roll was called. Minutes from the August , 2015 VbBS meeting were reviewed and approved . Staff reported that ICD -10-CM has been implemented as of today. All ICD -9 placement recommendations in the October V bBS packet are now informational only. HERC staff will keep ICD -9 codes available on and alternate version of the Prioritized List for the next few months for informa tional purposes as well. Staff are aware that there a likely errors in the ICD-10 codes on the Prioritized List and will be working diligently to correct these. Any errors found should be forwarded to staff. The 2016 CPT codes are now available and being reviewed by staff. Hodges asked that the straightforward codes be sent to committee members for review and comment prior to the meeting in November. Smits replied that she will send out a spreadsheet with the 2016 CPT codes with suggested placement once s he has been able to do an initial review . This list may include all codes or just straightforward codes, depending on the complexity of the review. Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10-1-2015 Page 4 The Oral Health Advisory Pa nel (OHAP ) and Behavioral Health Advisory Panel ( BHAP ) met and their recommend ations are included in the VbBS meeting materials. The obesity taskforce is being constituted with a first meeting planned for the winter. Gary Allen, DMD , has been senate approved for membership on the HERC. The HERC will be asked to appoint him to the VbBS at their meeting later today, to replace James Tyack, DMD , as the dental expert on the subcommittee. The errata document was reviewed and there was no discussion. Topic: Straightforward/Consent Agenda Discussion: There was no discussion about the c onsent agenda items. Recommended Actions: 1. Add 43771 (Laparoscopy, surgical, gastric restrictive procedure; revision of adjustable gastric restrictive device component only) to line 428 COMPLICATIONS OF A PROCEDURE USUALLY REQUIRING TREATMENT 2. Add 93740 to the Services Recommended for Non -Coverage (SRNC) Table 3. Advise Health Services Division ( HSD ) to remove 93740 (Temperature gradient studies) from the Diagnostic Procedures File 4. Advise HSD to move 76831 (Saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS), including c olor flow Doppler, when performed) from the Ancillary File to the Diagnostic Workup File 5. Add 58321 -58323 (Artificial insemination) to the SRNC 6. Advise HSD to remove 58321 -58323 from the Ancillary File MOTION: To approve the recommendations stated in the co nsent agenda . CARRIES 7-0. Topic: 2016 CDT codes and OH AP report Discussion: Smits reviewed a spreadsheet with the OHAP recommendations for placement of the 2016 CDT codes, and a document reviewing placement recommendations for CDT codes appearing on both the Prioritized List and one of the HSD code files . There was no discussion about these documents. Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) was discussed in detail. Bruce Austen, DMD, the dental director for OHA, testified that silver diamine fluoride d oes tur n caries black, but arrests the decay process. Dentis ts can do a second step to clear out the decay and add a more cosmetically acceptable filling. However, the SDF allows the dentist to avoid anesthetics Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10-1-2015 Page 5 and drilling in young children and in the elderly. This makes caries arrest more readily available and more acceptable to the patient and less traumatic. He is in favor of SDF coverage and feels that medicaments are a new paradigm in the treatment of decay. Smits noted that the medicaments must currentl y be applied by dental trained personnel. It is very easy to apply and may be done by non -trained personnel in the future , for example in the school . Gibson asked for relative cost information vs . standard restoration. Austen responded that SDF is very c ost effective, with a 100 dose bottle costing about $125. There is also no dental office time, anesthetic costs, etc. Karen Nolan , who is a n OHAP member , testified on behalf of her employer, ODS. ODS is not in favor of covering SDF . ODS dentists are con cerned as it discolors teeth. Patients will need fillings eventually, so it will not save costs and will add cost for the exams and application twice a year on top of the usual filling costs. ODS feels that this treatment is experimental. It was noted th at Gary Allen, who is a member of OHAP and will be joining the HERC, has a conflict of interest regarding SDF as his company markets this product. Coffman noted that Dr. Allen had plann ed to recuse himself from any vote on this topic. Recommended Action s: 1. Placement of 2016 CDT codes as shown in Appendix A 2. For CDT codes appearing on the Prioritized List and one of the HSD coding files, remove those codes from all other coding files and ke ep on their current line location on the Prioritized List 3. Add a new guideline for silver diamine fluoride as shown in Appendix B 4. Delete GN 91 MOTION: To recommend th e code and guideline note changes as presented. CARRIES 7 -0. Topic: 2016 CPT codes Discussion: This section was informational only. HERC staff will bring back these codes for official approval with the other 2016 CPT codes at the November 2015 V bBS meeting. The group discussed fetal MRI. There was discussion about the proposed guideline note. The group felt that there should be a requirement for two physic ians, one a fetal or pediatric radiologist, to agree on the medical necessity of the MRI. Hodges requested that a clause be added requiring >17 weeks of estimated fetal age. There were Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10-1-2015 Page 6 questions about any specific requirements for the MRI machine, the trai ning of the MRI tech or the reading radiologist. HERC staff were directed to reach out to radiologist and maternal -fetal medicine specialists to determ ine the best guideline wording. High dose radionucleotide skin surface brachytherapy was briefly discuss ed. The subcommittee agreed with the staff recommendation to place on the Services Recommended for Non -Coverage Table. Intravasular non -coronary ultrasound was discussed . There was a question about whether a guideline should be developed to limit the ves sels in which this could be used. The thought was that this would be difficult to determine and the code should be suggested for the Diagnostic Procedures File. Reflectance confocal microscopy for skin lesions was briefly discussed. The subcommittee agree d that this procedure was experimental and should be placed on the Services Recommended for Non -Coverage Table. Intrastromal corneal ring segments was reviewed without substantive discussion. The subcommittee agreed that this procedure should be added to the line containing keratoconus with the proposed guideline. Recommended Actions: HERC staff will further research the 2016 CPT codes and bring recommendations for the entire set to the next VBBS meeting . Topic: Temporary prostatic stents Discussion : Smits reviewed the summary document. There was minimal discussion. Recommended Action: Delete temporary prostatic stents (CPT 53855) from lines 332 FUNCTIONAL AND MECHANICAL DISORDERS OF THE GENITOURINARY SYSTEM INCLUDING BLADDER OUTLET OBSTRUCTION an d 334 CANCER OF PROSTATE GLAND and add to the Services Recommended for Non -Coverage Table as investigational .

Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10-1-2015 Page 10 Topic: Botulinum toxin for migraines and bladder conditions Discussion: Smits reviewed the summary document. Gibson voiced concerns about th e poor quality of the underlying studies cited in the botulinum toxin for migraine review. He was concerned about covering this treatment at all given its questionable efficacy. Williams agreed that there was little evidence to support the use of botulin um toxin for migraines. Gibson recommended increasing the proposed reduction in migraine frequency required for continued therapy from the proposed 6 to 8, to better reflect the study findings. Gibson also expressed concern about the use of urinary frequen cy reductions as a requirement for continuation for botulinum toxin for bladder indications as this symptom may just be a variant of normal. However, it was pointed out that earlier in the guideline, use is restricted to specific bladder indications and Gibson agreed that frequency reduction was acceptable as an outcome for those conditions. Karen Campbell from Allergan testified that botulinum toxin for bladder indications is reserved for patients failing oral medications, and the only alternative to bo tulinum injections is nerve stimulation or bladder surgery. She noted that one injection may provide symptom relief for 6 months or longer. Ms. Campbell further testified that migraine patients must also fail oral therapy prior to consideration for botul inum toxin. The other possible treatments for these patients include nerve block or neurostimulation, reflecting that few other options exist for this group of patients. She testified that many patients continue to improve the more injections they have. T he treatment for migraines involve 31 injections during the session, and patients are only likely to endure this amount of injections if the treatment is actually helpful. She did not agree with requiring a reduction in headache days as a requirement for c ontinuing therapy. She testified that patients improve in other ways, such as improvement in the level of pain on headache days or in quality of life measures. They may have shorter headaches, less intense headaches, have better response to their acute he adache pain medications, less disability and improved ability to work. Chronic migraine patients have hypers ensitivity to stimuli, and botulinum toxin injections can gradually help this. Clinical trials and practice show that botulinum toxin injection may require 2 -3 injection cycles to improve h ypersensitivity and headaches. She felt that the HERC s hould base coverage on symptomatic and functional improvement for these patients. She was concerned that the proposed guideline would mean that patients with reductions of 4 or 5 headache days would not qualify for further treatment and yet would have quality of life improvements. She suggested that the committee review utilization in O regon to see if this treatment is overused or high. Jane Stevens from Allerga n testified that most private insurance plans require a reduction of 7 headache days per month or 100 headache hours per month for continued coverage of botulinum toxin injections for migraines. Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10-1-2015 Page 11 The subcommittee debated whether to require a reduction of 6, 7 or 8 headache days per month for the migraine guideline. The reduction of 7 days was determined to be the best compromise. The subcommittee debated about the number of incontinence incidents or episodes of urinary frequency required for the bladder conditions guideline. The group increased the reduction of frequency episodes to 8 and the incontinence episodes to 2 to better reflect the reductions seen with botulinum treatment in the clinical trials. Recommended Actions: 1. Adopt a new guideline for l ine 414 as shown in Appendix B 2. Adopt a new guideline for line 331 as shown in Appendix B MOTION: To recommend the guideline note changes as amend ed. CARRIES 7 -0. Topic: Coverage of perforations of the ear drum with hearing loss Discussion: Smits rev iewed the summary document. There was minimal discussion. Recommended Actions: 1. Add diagnosis codes for ear drum perforations/open wounds to lines 316 HEARING LOSS - AGE 5 OR UNDER and 450 HEARING LOSS - OVER AGE OF FIVE and keep on line 479 CHRONIC OTI TIS MEDIA, OPEN WOUND OF EAR DRUM a.

Adopt a new guideline note for lines 316, 450 and 479 as shown in Appendix B MOTION: To recommend t he code and guideline note changes as presented. CARRIES 7 -0. Topic: Acute peripheral nerve injury guideline Discussion: Smits revie wed the summary document. The subcommittee discussed the fact that the neurosurgeon who brough t up the issue recommended exte nding the limit to 6 months and recommended that the guideline was modified only to extend the Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10-1-2015 Page 12 surgical period to 6 months, rather than the proposed 1 year. The exceptions process could be used for patients who are between 6 months and 1 year from injury. Recommended Actions: 1. Modify GN133 as shown in Appendix C MOTION: To recommend the guideline note changes as amend ed. CARRIES 7 -0. Topic: Tobacco cessation coverage and prevention Discussion: This topic was tabled to the November, 2015 VBBS meeting Topic: Tobacco use and elective surgery Discussion: This topic was tabled to the November, 2015 VBBS meeting Topic: Acupunctur e guideline referral requirement Discussion: Smits reviewed the summary document. There was discussion about whether acupuncturists can generate diagnosis codes, which are required to determine if a condition is covered by this guideline. If acupuncturist s cannot make the diagnoses, then coverage of acupuncture must continue to be done by referral from a provider who can make diagnoses. Hodges argued that acupuncture should be covered like physical therapy; PT requires an ICD9/10 code from a provider and a referral/order. Ocker indicated that acupuncturists are capable of making certain diagnoses, but not complex diagnoses. It was also noted that the staff proposed changed all acupuncture indications to have 12 covered acupuncture sessions. This is in con flict with the new back conditions guideline, which allows up to 30 visits. Staff was advised to rework this portion of the guideline. Livingston recommended that retaining the referral requirement for pelvic pain during pregnancy was appropriate, as thi s symptom can be caused by many conditions, and should be evaluated by a maternity care provider first. Ocker raised no objections to this. Staff was directed to work with the HSD clinical services unit to determine what acupuncturists can diagnosis and code and how referrals should work for acupuncture. Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10-1-2015 Page 13 Recommended Actions: HERC staff to research whether acupuncturists can make diagnoses and whether acupuncture services need a referral. This topic will be revisited at a future meeting. Topic: Ment al health guideline s for children Discussion: Smits briefly reviewed this topic which had been previously reviewed by BHAP. There was minimal discussion. Recommended Actions: 1) Guideline note 20 ATTENTION DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDERS IN CHILDREN was amended as shown in appendix C 2) Guideline notes 28, 42 and 45 were deleted as shown in appendix D Topic: Statement of Intent 3 - Behavioral Health Integration Discussion: Smits reviewed the summary document. There was minimal discussion. Recommended Acti ons: Delete SOI3 as shown in Appendix D MOTION: To recommend the statement of intent be deleted as presented. CARRIES 7- 0. Topic: Breast augmentation and penile implant coverage for gender dysphoria Discussion: Smits reviewed the staff summary docume nt. Gibson objected to adding coverage for breast augmentation, arguing that this service is not covered for other women with social functioning issues due to small breast size, and that this type of procedure is cosmetic. Hodges agreed that breast augment ation appears to be cosmetic and coverage for gender dysphoria is unfair to other women with breast size issues. Dr. Megan Bird from Legacy testified that the goal of breast augmentation for patients with gender dysphoria is to reduce the dysphoria, suic ide rates, and other negative outcomes. Breasts are an overwhelming cue for a person to be recognized by others as a women. She argued that lack of coverage will increase the risk of violence and is therefore a safety issue. Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10-1-2015 Page 14 Gibson raised concerns that the presence of breasts is a defining aspect of being a women. Williams argued that the coverage for adolescents to receive early hormone treatment should lessen the need for breast reconstructions. Bird responded that access to hormones, specifically es trogen for breast development, is limited for many patients due to medical or other issues. Olson noted b reast reconstruction is covered for patients with breast cancer, and he was wondering whether gender dysphoria should be considered a biologic condit ion on par with breast cancer. He also noted that patients with gender dysphoria as a group have terrible outcomes with no treatment, which is not the case for other women with simple cosmetic breast concerns. Bird argued that the improvement in outcome s reviewed in the studies by HERC included breast augmentation as a possible therapy. The reduction in suicide rates and other negative outcomes were based on access to a package of therapy which included breast augmentation. Amy Penkin, LCSW, from OHSU testified that breast surgery actually treats the dysphoria, rather than just being for social passing. She argued that linking it to gender dysphoria sets it apart from the cosmetic use. Gibson asked when breasts could be considered large enough to be ad equate to address gender dysphoria. Bird responded that there are guidelines based on Tanner developmental stages. Stage 5 on the Tanner scale corresponds to adult female breasts. This is a structural assessment, rather than based on size. Neola Young , from Basic Rights Oregon , testified that breast surgery is more important to many transgender women th an other types of gender dysphoria surgery. It is an important service to offer to reduce self harm in this population. The discussion on penile implan ts was short. Bird testified that the only entity covering this is the city of San Francisco and they require 2 physicians to agree that the procedure is necessary, a surgeon's note that the phallus is appropriate for the prostheses, and evidence that the patient has used and failed external support devices. Recommended Actions: 1. Add coverage for breast augmentation for male to female patients a.

Topic: Coverage G uidance\u2014Planned Out-of-hospital births Discussion: Livingston presented the process overview, evidence summary and core issues addressed by public comment. Dr. Duncan Neilson was introduced as an appointed expert. He is the Clinical Vice President of surgical services of Legacy health system and an obstetr ician/gynecologist. Dr. Neilson reviewed the history of this effort beginning with a legislative mandate that involved licensing direct entry midwives as of January 2015 and an Oregon Health Authority Licensed Direct Entry Midwifery Workgroup that recomme nded that HERC evaluate the evidence and update the appropriate risk criteria to try to ensure safe and effective planned out-of-hospital birth s. The subcommittee discussed that these risk criteria are about coverage. A woman with risk criteria may choose to have a planned out-of-hospital birth, but this would not be covered by the Oregon Health Plan. There was an amendment made to the box language to clarify that the intent is about coverage. Livingston proceeded to discuss the options, being explicit ab out which criteria needed to be ruled out and also allowing for ambiguity when certain criteria may remain unknown if there were not clinical suspicion that would indicate a workup was appropriate. The example of ultrasound was discussed and the subcommitt ee agreed that it would be necessary to rule out certain risk criteria. Livingston highlighted some of the risk criteria that had received more public comment as well as some suggestions for clarifying language. There was a discussion as to whether lethal congenital anomalies with planned nonrescucitation would be appropriate for coverage in an out -of-hospital birth setting. Kim Wentz stated that there are times when the prenatal diagnosis is wrong or the parents change their mind when the baby is born. N eilson stated that there are some lethal congenital anomalies that are more black and white and others that are gray. Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10-1-2015 Page 16 Also, in some cases it may be more explicit that nonresuscitation is clearly appropriate and changes in diagnosis or management plans are highly unlikely. There was a discussion about preserving the autonomy of the mother if the fetus doesn't require treatment. Anencephaly was given as an example. After discussion the subcommittee decided to move the revised language including \"nonresuscita tion planned\" to be a criteri on requiring consultation . There was a discussion of a series of criteria that may not be known if there was no clinical suspicion, but also needing to define what those clinical factors may be. In a discussion about intraute rine growth reduction ( IUGR ), initially there was a proposal to define concerning clinical signs such as fundal height <3 cm from estimated gestational age over two measurements ; however, Neilson suggested that other factors besides fundal height may be im portant and the estimation of fetal weight is multimodal. The language was changed to state that serial fundal measurements are required, but not to define what exactly suspicion for IUGR would entail. It was concluded that both serial blood pressure meas urements and serial fundal heights would be required in order to verify the absence or presence of this high risk criteria. There was a discussion of the unknown syphilis, HIV, or Hepatitis B status and a proposal to add \"positive\" status to the coverage exclusion criteria. Members discussed whether appropriate care could be given to a positive mother in a home setting and they decided that given the potential risk to the fetus/infant and the potential for intervention, that these would be risk criteria th at would exclude a woman from coverage. Syphilis was added based on a staff recommendation as a result of recent public health data showing an increase in syphilis in Oregon. Pollack commented and others agreed that readability of the box language would b e improved with categorizing of the risk conditions. Public comment: Jeannie Stagner , CNM, of Klamath Falls. She stated she has been a m idwife for 33 years , starting as direct entry midwife and later serving as a c onsultant to the Arizona State Departmen t of Health Services. She stated she d oes not have hospital privileges and has a licensed birth center. She expressed concerns that inadequate stakeholder representation was involved in the process, and that guidelines are attempting to change midwifery s tatutes. She stated that 100% of her patients would have been found ineligible according to consultation guidelines, specifically raising concerns about VBAC and women receiving outpatient mental health care. She also raised concerns about the availability of consultants, especially in rural communities. Neilson reviewed the history of this process star ting with the legislation, the development of the licensed direct entry midwifery workgroup , including involvement Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 10-1-2015 Page 17 of stakeholders with midwifery represent ation , and how the HERC work result s from those processes. The subcommittee discussed revising the language around maternal mental illness. Pollack suggested requiring consultation in cases where there is suspicion for psychosis or self -harm. The subcom mittee ran out of further discussion time. There was a discussion about the word \"compliance\" and the feeling it invokes. It was clarified that this will serve as the basis for rules and compliance would be an appropriate choice of words. Summary of cha nges agreed to prior to the end of the meeting : Clarify further that these high risk criteria relate to coverage Move life -threatening congenital anomalies (unless fatal anomalies with nonresuscitation planned) to consultation criteria Add that serial fun dal height measurements and serial blood pressure measurements are required Add unknown, or positive, syphilis, HIV, or hepatitis B status to high risk coverage exclusion criteria Categorize risk conditions in box language to improve readability Discuss f urther modifying the language on maternal mental illness requiring outpatient psychiatric care Discussion to continue at the November 12, 2015 V bBS/HERC meetings .

Common cases benefitting from unilateral paravertebral blocks are breast surgery, thoracotomy , herniorrhaphy, open cholecystectomy , and open nephrectomy. Bilateral paravertebral blocks can be a viable option for midline abdominal surgery. The clinician may cons ider thoracic paravertebral blockade over thoracic epidural in patients for whom bilateral sympathectomy and subsequent hypotension would be especially detrimental. For example, the use of thoracic paravertebral blockade in a patient with severe aortic stenosis has been reported. In another study, thoracic paravertebral blockade resulted in more stable hemodynamics and equivalent when compared to thoracic epidural anal gesia in thorocotomy patients. However, because bilateral spread can occur , this may cause hemodynamic compromise similar to epidural blockade. The new CPT codes were developed to differentiate the paravertebral block from the transforaminal epidural (CPT 64479 -64484), which are used to treat back pain and are currently on the Servi ces Recommended for Non -Coverage. Ancillary Guideline A1 governs coverage of nerve blocks. HERC staff recommendations : 1) Recommend that HSD p lace CPT 64461 -64463 (paravertebral blocks) on the Ancillary File a. Anesthesia codes are traditionally Ancillary 2) Modify Ancillary Guideline A1 as shown below ANCILLARY GUIDELINE A1, NERVE BLOCKS The Health Evidence Review Commission intends that single injection and continuous nerve blocks (CPT 64400 -64450 , 64461 -64463 ) should be covered services if they are required for successful completion of perioperative pain control for, or post -operative recovery from a covered operative procedure when the diagnosis requiring the operative procedure is also covered. Additionally, nerve blocks are covered services for patients ho spitalized with trauma, cancer, or intractable pain conditions, if the underlying condition is a covered diagnosis. Endobronchial Ultrasound (EBUS) 1 CPT codes : aspiration[s]/biopsy[ies]), one or two mediastinal and/or hilar lymph node stations or structures 31653 : 3 or more mediastinal and/or hilar lymph node stations or structures 31654 : Bronchoscopy with transendoscopic endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) during bronchoscopic lesion(s) : 31652 31620 bronchoscopic diagnostic or therapeutic intervention(s)). 31620 was reviewed in 2004 as a new code by the HSC and excluded as the oncologist then on the Commission felt that the lymph nodes would be biopsied anyway, an d the ultrasound did not add to the diagnostic work up. Since the 2004 review, there have been several meta -analyses published showing improved diagnostic accuracy with EBUS. New NCCN and NICE practice guidelines include the use of EBUS. Evidence /oth er policies 1) NCCN 2015 Clinical Practice Guideline Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer : a. Diagnostic tools that provide important additional strategies for biopsy include : endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) guided biopsy 2) NICE 2011 guidance on lung cancer (study not included due to length) : a. For diagnosis and staging i. Offer PET -CT, or EBUS -guided non -ultrasound -guided TBNA as the first test for patients with an intermediate probability of mediastinal malignancy (lymph nodes between 10 and 20 mm maximum short axis on CT) who are potentially suitable for treatment with curative intent ii. Offer EBUS -guided TBNA for biopsy of paratracheal and peri -bronchial intraparenchymal lung lesions. iii. Offer neck ultrasound with sampling of visible lymph nodes or non - ultrasound -guided TBNA to patients with a high probability of mediastinal malignancy (lymph nodes > 20 mm maximum short axis on CT). If neck ultrasound is negative, follow with non TBNA, -guided FNA. iv. Consider combined EBUS a nd EUS for initial staging of the mediastinum as an alternative to surgical staging. v. Confirm negative results obtained by non -ultrasound -guided TBNA using EBUS -guided TBNA, EUS -guided FNA or surgical staging. vi.

Sclerotherapy included on the Prioritized List. Sclerotherapy for cysts or other fluid collections involves inserting a needle in to the fluid cavity, draining the fluid and then injecting a caustic agent such as ethanol or minocycline to cause the cavity to scar closed. Cysts and other fluid cavities may require treatment if they enlarge and cause pain or dysfunction or cause bleed ing, infection, or organ torsion. Sclerosis is most commonly done with hepatic and renal cysts. Cheng 2012 review ed sclerotherapy for treatment of hepatic and renal cysts, and lymphoceles and finds this therapy to be effective for these conditions when they are symptomatic. Lohela 2002 review ed sclerotherapy for hepatic and and parathyroid cysts, pleural cysts, and hydroceles and found the therapy to be effective.

From a histologic perspective, cystic lesions are classi ed as true cysts, containing epithelium or endotheli- um, or pseudocysts. They can occur sporadically or as part ofsyndromes such as Von Hippel-Lindau or autosomal domi- nant polycystic kidney disease. Additionally, acquired cysts can result from trauma or infection. They can be found inessentially every solid organ in the body but most commonly affect the liver, pancreas, kidney, and ovary. Some authors extend the de nition of cystic and bilomas. With modern cross-sectional imaging techniques, cystic lesions are very common and usually incidental ndings, especially if small. However, when cysts enlarge, become infected, bleed, or undergo torsion, they can be symptomatic,and percutaneous drainage can be effective in the manage- ment. 1When cysts recur after aspiration, which is often the case for hepatic and renal cysts,2cyst sclerosis or surgical unroo ng may be required. General Principles of Sclerotherapy Patients with symptomatic cysts should be referred for imaging. The chosen modality usually depends on the loca-tion of the cysts. Ultrasound is fast and readily available, and due to lack of radiation is usually used rst. Ultrasound is also usually preferred in certain situations, such as in the evalua-tion of ovarian cysts or more super cial postoperative lym- phoceles. Magnetic resonance imaging may be better at identifying the organ of origin for deep pelvic cysts. Simplecysts are typically dark on T1-weighed images and bright on T2-weighted images. However, these signals undergo changes if the cysts are proteinaceous or hemorrhagic.Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) can detect solid organ cysts and cysts in other locations well. Simple cysts in general have a thin wall without mural thickening ornodularity. Therapeutic options for cystic lesions include surgical resection or unroo ng, percutaneous aspiration, percutane- ous drainage, and sclerotherapy. Surgery, despite its higher morbidity and the added risk associated with anesthesia, is used in cases when there is no safe percutaneous window,when percutaneous treatment has failed, or in certain cysts located in the liver (surgical unroo ng or alcoholAbstract With modern cross-sectional imaging techniques, cystic lesions are very common and usually incidental ndings, especially if small. However, when cysts enlarge, become infected, bleed, or undergo torsion, they can be symptomatic, and percutaneousdrainage can be effective in the management. When cysts recur after aspiration, whichis often the case for hepatic and renal cysts, cyst sclerosis or surgical unroo ng may be required.

In mostcases ultrasound is the only imagingand guidance modality needed; how-ever, it is of the utmost importanceto remember that CT and fluorosco-py with contrast often give invalu-able information when the true ex-tent of the process has to be deter-mined and when assessing the safestroute for the catheter in anatomicallycomplicated areas.

Keywords Drainage \u00b7 Sclerotherapy \u00b7 Ultrasound \u00b7 Abscess \u00b7 sclerotherapy Introduction Ultrasonically guided drainage is usually the simplest way to treat abscess or fluid collections [1, 2]; however,CT fluoroscopy offers the localization advantages of CTwith improved procedure time, and facilitates effectiveperformance of percutaneous abdominal and pelvic inter-ventional procedures in anatomically difficult areas, suchas pancreas, or em-pyemas. [3, 4]. Conventional fluoroscopy with injectionof contrast medium via the drainage catheter is also use-ful in assessing the true extent of the inflammatory pro-cess. Color power Doppler is useful when determiningsafe access route for the puncture needle or catheter toavoid great vessels, and to detect aneurysms and arterio-venous malformations.Sclerotherapy is used to treat for abscess drainages and sclerotherapy Informing the patient and the staff of the clinical depart- ment and the cooperation of the patient is of utmost im-portance in interventional procedures [7].

Lohela imaging guidance (eg, ultrasound and/or fluoroscopy) Issue : This is a new type of treatment code. However, t he use of this procedure has been reported in the literature for more than 30 years. It does not appear to be a procedure that would be likely to be abused or overused. Previously, this procedure was coded with more generic arterial embolization CPT codes. Ward 2010 reviewed the use of ureteral embolization, among other genitourinary embolization procedures. The reported uses for ureteral embolization were for urine leaks caused by vesicovaginal fistula, persistent urine leaks related to prior pelvic surgery, or pers istent hematuria secondary to an unresectable malignancy. Excellent technical success rates with symptom resolution have been reported.

Ward, MD, Thomas E. Velling, MD Naval Medical Center, San Diego With the advent of smaller vascular catheters and improved imaging techniques, percutaneous transcatheter embolization has become a valuable adjunct for thetreatment of patients with various genitourinary pathologic conditions. Multipleembolic agents are now employed in an array of situations to devascularize organs, stop bleeding, and embolization has in the management of renal cell carci- noma (RCC), renal trauma, ureteral occlusion, bladder hemorrhage, pelvicbleeding trauma or surgery, internal spermatic vein varicoceles, and high-flow arterial priapism. In this article, we briefly review thechoices open to urologists and their patients and the materials available to inter-ventional radiologists. Images detailing the treatment and anatomy in each caseare provided. Principles of Transcatheter Embolic Techniques Multiple materials for the occlusion of vessels have been evaluated during the de-velopment of embolization techniques. The choice of an embolic material for aspecific clinical situation depends on a variety of considerations: the size of thevessels or organ to be embolized, the size of the catheter that can be deployed tothe target region, whether repeated embolization through a specific arterial or ve-nous vasculature is anticipated, and whether temporary or permanent occlusion isdesired. Agents that offer temporary occlusion (days to weeks) with spontaneous disso- lution are absorbable gelatin sponge, microfibrillar collagen, and autologous clot(Figure 1). The most commonly used agent, absorbable gelatin sponge (1C), is usu-ally rolled into small, torpedo-shaped pieces and placed in a tuberculin syringe(1A). Multiple sponge rolls are then injected, with normal saline, directly into thevascular catheter, which has been positioned at the site of desired embolization. Agents that provide permanent vascular arealso extensively used to achieve permanent vascular occlusion. Their liquid stateallows peripheral embolization well beyond the limits of the smallest available vas-Intra -arterial Interventions for Acute Stroke 1 CPT code : any method, including placement, and intraprocedural pharmacological thrombolytic injection(s) Issue : Several new therapies for stroke have been developed and studied in the past decade which invol ve threading a catheter through the femoral artery to the affected artery in the brain. The stroke is then treated either by injecting thrombolytic medications directly into the affected artery or by removing a clot mechanically with or without placing a stent. The standard of care for acute stroke remains the peripheral IV infusion of thrombolytics, except for those patients with a hemorrhagic stroke or with other contraindications to thrombolytic therapy.

The current evidence on mechanical clot retrieval for treating acute ischaemic stroke shows that efficacy is unproven. With regard to safety, there are risks of serious complications. The following recommendations balance these considerations against the poor prognosis of many patients with stroke. Suitability for thrombolysis can b e guided by criteria used in the Pragmatic Ischaemic Stroke Thrombectomy Evaluation (PISTE) trial. c. Patients with acute ischaemic stroke for whom thrombolysis is unsuitable or has failed: The procedure should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or research. d. Patients with acute ischaemic stroke for whom thrombolysis is suitable: The proce dure should only be used in the context of research Intra -arterial Interventions for Acute Stroke 2 e. Selection of patients for mechanical clot removal should be done by clinicians experienced in the use of thrombolysis for stroke. The procedure should be carried out in specialist centres by experienced i nterventional neuroradiologists with appropriate facilities and support 1) AHRQ 2013, evidence review for mechanical thrombectomy for the treatment of acute stroke a. Conclusions: Currently available neurothrombectomy devices offer intriguing treatment options i n patients with acute ischemic stroke, although a paucity of high quality research currently exists. There remains a need for further research on the topic, including randomized controlled trials to determine the optimal device(s) to use, and the patient p opulations most likely to benefit from their use. b. Noted that 11 ongoing studies are examining the use of mechanical thrombectomy in stroke 2) CTAF 2013, review of thrombectomy for treatment of acute stroke (PDF not included due to size) a. There was no benefit to intraarterial therapy in any of the studies (compared to IV thrombolytics) including the subset of patients with significant amounts of pote ntially salvageable ischemic brain tissue seen on brain imaging prior to the intervention. All of the trials reported significant adverse events related to the intra -arterial procedure in a clinical important proportion of the treated patients. b. It is reco mmended that the use of the thrombectomy devices does not meet Technology Assessment Criteria 3 through 5 for safety, effectiveness and improvement in health outcomes when used to treat acute ischemic stroke. c. There was a note that the review was limited du e to the majority of studies reviewed using older generation devices; early studies on newer generation devices were more promising 1) Prabhakaran 2015 , systematic review of treatments for acute stroke a. Intravascular thrombolysis is the standard of care for patients presenting within 4.5 hours of onset of acute stroke b. No recommendation made for use of intra -arterial thrombolytics i.

Intra -arterial fibrinolysis is beneficial for treatment of carefully selected patients with major ischemic strokes of <6 hours' duration caused by occlusions of the MCA who are not otherwise candidates for intravenous rtPA (Class I; Level of Evidence B) . The optimal dose of intra -arterial rtPA is not well established, and rtPA does not have FDA approva l for intra -arterial use . c. As with intravenous fibrinolytic therapy, reduced time from symptom onset to reperfusion with intraarterial therapies is highly correlated with better clinical outcomes, and all efforts must be undertaken to minimize delays to def initive therapy (Class I; Level of Evidence B) . d. Intra -arterial treatment requires the patient to be at an experienced stroke center with rapid access to cerebral angiography and qualified interventionalists . An emphasis on expeditious assessment and treatment should be made. Facilities are encouraged to define criteria that can be used to credential individuals who can perform intra -arterial revascularization procedures. Outcomes on all patients should be tr acked (Class I; Level of Evidence C) . e. When mechanical thrombectomy is pursued, stent retrievers such as Solitaire FR and are to coil retrievers such as Merci (Class I; Level of Evidence A) . The relative effectiveness of the Penum bra System versus stent retrievers is not yet characterized. The Merci, Penumbra System, Solitaire FR, and Trevo thrombectomy devices can be useful in achieving recanalization alone or in combination with pharmacological fibrinolysis in carefully selected patients (Class IIa; Level of Intra -arterial Interventions for Acute Stroke 4 Evidence B) . Their ability to improve patient outcomes has not yet been established. These devices should continue to be studied in randomized controlled trials to determine the efficacy of such treatments in improving patien t outcomes. g. Intra -arterial fibrinolysis or mechanical thrombectomy is reasonable in patients who have contraindications to the use of intravenous fibrinolysis (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C) . h. Rescue intra -arterial fibrinolysis or mechanical thrombectom y may be reasonable approaches to recanalization in patients with large -artery occlusion who have not responded to intravenous fibrinolysis.

Page 9 of 9Background Acute ischemic strokes are associated with poor outcomes and high health care burden. In patients with occlusions of large cerebral vessels, patients with high baseline stroke severity scores as defined by the National Institute of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS), and patients unlikely to benefit or having failed treatment with intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), there is a need for alternative methods of revascularization which can improve outcomes without increasing the risk for intracranial hemorrhage. The uses of various neurothrombectomy devices (clot retrievers, aspiration/suction devices, snare- like devices, ultrasonography technologies, and lasers) have been examined in these populations. Currently, two neurothrombectomy devices are FDA- cleared through the FDA 510(k) process: the MERCI clot retriever and the Penumbra System. Various ongoing clinical trials are currently evaluating the impact of these devices, as well as other (off-label) neurothrombectomy devices, for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. The goal of this technical brief is to describe neurothrombectomy devices currently being used or actively investigated in the treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke and to summarize the evidence supporting their use.Neurothrombectomy Devices for Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke Executive Summary Effective Health Care Program The Effective Health Care Program was initiated in 2005 to provide valid evidence about the comparative effectiveness of different medical interventions. The object is to help consumers, health care providers, and others in making informed choices among treatment alternatives. Technical Briefs are designed to provide an overview of key issues related to clinical intervention or health care services, especially those for which there are limited published data or protocol-driven studies. They provide an early objective description of the state of science, a potential framework for assessing applications and implications, a summary of ongoing research, and information on future research needs. The full report and this summary are available at www.effectivehealthcare. ahrq.gov/reports/final.cfm. Effective Health Care Effective Health Care ProgramTechnical Brief Number 4 2Methods We developed a list of neurothrombectomy devices based on the FDA Center for Device and Radiological Health (CDRH) guidance definition of a neurothrombectomy device, published literature, and a search of the FDA CDRH's database to identify neurothrombectomy devices that have received FDA clearance (510(k) documents). Systematic literature searches were conducted of MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, from the earliest possible date through November 2010. Grey literature searches were also conducted, utilizing Google, clinicaltrials.gov, and manual searching techniques. Two investigators independently screened citations at the abstract level to identify potentially relevant studies, case series, and case reports. Throughout this technical brief, our use of the terminology \"studies\" will refer only to prospective, single-arm studies or retrospective studies enrolling consecutive patients. The terminology \"reports\" will refer to the latter studies in addition to case series and case reports. Potentially eligible citations were retrieved for full-text review. We included human studies of any design, case series, and case reports as long as they included patients with an acute ischemic stroke and reported at least one outcome of interest. We included only reports in English in our qualitative review of the literature. Two investigators independently abstracted data from eligible reports, and disagreements were resolved by a third investigator. We obtained the following information from each report: author identification, year of publication, study design characteristics, study population, patient baseline characteristics, disease severity, location of occluded artery, time from symptom onset to device deployment or angiography, use of concurrent standard medical therapies, whether outcomes assessment was blinded, and the device used. Effectiveness outcomes included: recanalization as measured by post-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade or similar methodology,mortality, modified Rankin Scale (mRS), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, Barthel Index, and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Harms included failure to deploy the device or remove the clot, device breakage or fracture, perforation, dissection, thrombus formation, vasospasm, or hemorrhage. We used descriptive statistics and summative tables to synthesize data regarding study designs, clinical and treatment characteristics, effectiveness outcomes, and adverse events reported. We created study density figures to summarize the totality of information available on the effectiveness and safety of these devices. Results Key Question 1. What are the different types of neurothrombectomy devices in use or in development for treatment of acute ischemic stroke? Table A provides a list of the various neuthrombectomy classes (clot retrievers, aspiration/suction devices, snare-like devices, ultrasonography technologies, and lasers) and devices in those classes. Neurothrombectomy devices: (1) allow patients to avoid or reduce the use of pharmacologic thrombolysis, thereby minimizing the risk for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH); (2) can be used beyond the short timeframe to which rtPA is limited; (3) may provide more rapid recanalization than thrombolytics; and (4) can provide a treatment option for thrombi more resistant to fibrinolytic breakdown. However, the technical difficulty of navigating mechanical devices into the intracranial circulation may result in direct trauma to the neurovasculature (including vasospasm, vessel dissection, perforation, or rupture), and fragmenting thrombi may subsequently embolize into previously unaffected vessels and cerebral territories. In addition, the procedure itself carries risks, including the need for intubation and heavy sedation, which have been associated with worse outcomes.3Only the MERCI clot retriever and the Penumbra System are FDA cleared for use in patients with an acute ischemic stroke to restore perfusion. Other devices have FDA indications ranging from retrieval of intravascular foreign bodies to infusion of fluids into the peripheral vasculature. Data on the utilization of these various devices are limited. Recent and ongoing studies are evaluating the use of \"retrievable\" intracranial stents that are meant to provide immediate recanalization and then be removed along with clot trapped within the stent matrix. A recent prospective, single-center pilot study reported on the safety and efficacy of a retrievable stent in 20 acute stroke patients with a large vessel occlusion who were either refractory to or ineligible for IV rtPA therapy. The stents were deployed for from 1 to 2 minutes before retrieval, with 18 of 20 (90 percent) of patients achieving successful revascularization. Six patients (30 percent) had asymptomatic ICH while 2 patients (10 percent) experienced symptomatic ICH. Table A.

From a systematic scan of studies of different types of neurothrombectomy devices, what are the type(s) of devices, study designs and sizes, patient characteristics, comparators used in comparative studies, lengths of followup, concurrent or prior therapies, outcomes measured, and adverse events, harms, and safety issues reported? A total of 2,054 citations were identified, 378 of which were retrieved for full-text review. A total of 87 articles were ultimately included in the study. Sixty-two articles (71 percent) were case series or case reports, 18 (21 percent) were prospective single-arm studies, and 7 (8 percent) were non-comparative, retrospective studies enrolling consecutive patients. These studies were published in full-text (74 percent) or abstract form (26 percent). Fifteen of 25 studies (60 percent) were published between 2008 and 2010. Only 3 of 18 (17 percent) prospective and 1 of 7 retrospective studies clearly stated that they utilized blinded outcome assessment. The largest percentage of overall reports (40 percent) and prospective studies (31 percent) were for the MERCI clot retriever. The Penumbra System had 10 reports, of which 4 were prospective. For off-labelEPAR=Endovascular Photoacoustic two studies were Phenox, Amplatz Gooseneck, and LaTIS. The size of prospective single-arm studies ranged from 2 to 164 patients, and retrospective studies ranged from 15 to 114 patients. The largest studies evaluated the MERCI clot retriever (numbers ranged from 18 to 164 patients) and the Penumbra System (numbers ranged from 15 to 125 patients). Studies of \"off-label\" devices ranged from 2 to 45 patients. The remaining 62 of 87 (71 percent) articles were either case series or case reports. In total, 191 patients were evaluated with a neurothrombectomy device in case series and case reports. The combined number of patients evaluated in a case series or case report with a neurothrombectomy device ranged from 0 (EPAR and LaTIS lasers) to 75 (MERCI clot retriever). Case series and reports provide the majority of data on off-label use (n=109 patients) of potential neurothrombectomy devices to treat acute ischemic stroke. Studies typically enrolled patients older than 18 years of age, with baseline NIHSS scores 8 (or 10), presenting within 8 hours of stroke symptom onset (or up to 24 hours for EKOS, EPAR, or LaTIS if a posterior circulation occlusion was identified), and having a complete or near complete (TIMI 0-1) occlusion of a treatable large intracranial vessel. Common exclusion criteria included advanced age, large brain infarction, abnormal hemostasis, severe or uncontrolled hypertension, hypoglycemia, and pregnancy. Studies also enrolled patients with contraindications to receive IV rtPA due to risks of adverse events, reporting outside a 3-hour window from symptom onset to IV rtPA, or who failed (target vessel not recanalized as determined by immediate angiography following the procedure) IV rtPA treatment. The one exception was the EKOS study by Tomsick in 2008. The EKOS device is designed to infuse intra-arterial (IA) thrombolytic therapy, and in this study EKOS was used along with reduced-dose IV rtPA within the first 3 hours of stroke symptoms. The mean/median baseline NIHSS range was 15 to 25 across studies. The range for mean/median age was 42 to 68 years and studies enrolled 20 to 57 percent females. In studies where data were provided, the majority of patients had pre-device TIMI 0 or 1 flow.Mean/median time from stroke symptom to either angiography or device deployment ranged from 141 to 388 minutes, well within the 8-hour timeframe suggested by the FDA CDRH guidance. The primary embolus was most commonly in an anterior vessel (14 studies enrolled >60 percent anterior occlusion patients). However, some studies focused heavily on posterior occlusions. Only 1 of 25 studies (4 percent) reported including patients with occlusions in other areas and 6 studies were unclear about the location of occlusion. A majority of case series and case reports included patients who would typically meet prospective study inclusion criteria. However, some case series and reports included both pediatric patients, those older than 80 years of age, and those with a baseline NIHSS score below or above the typical enrollment threshold of 8 to 10. Finally, some case series and reports for the Penumbra System, MERCI clot retriever, snares, enrolled patients with symptom-to-angiography or device deployment times outside the 8-hour window used in prospective and retrospective studies of these devices. The location of emboli reported in case series and case reports was predominantly anterior (72 percent) and posterior circulation (24 percent). No direct human comparative studies were identified during our scan of the neurothrombectomy literature. All prospective and retrospective studies reported recanalization success after neurothrombectomy device deployment. The longest durations of followup in the majority of prospective and retrospective studies reporting effectiveness outcomes were either 30 days or 90 days post-procedure. The timing of NIHSS evaluation was more variable with the longest duration of followup ranging from 24-hours to 90-days post- procedure. Safety endpoints were typically monitored over shorter lengths of time, such as the first 24 hours or until discharge. The reporting of followup outcomes in case series and case reports was variable. Of the 71 total device reports, nearly half did not report data on effectiveness or safety outcomes after patient discharge. In those reports that did, length of followup ranged from 6 weeks to 24 months; the most commonly reported length of followup was 90 days.6Prospective and retrospective neurothrombectomy studies focus on patients contraindicated to receive IV rtPA, reporting outside the recommended 3-hour window, or refractory to or failing IV rtPA treatment. Consequently, the use of IV rtPA among studies ranged from 0 to 100 percent. The one exception was the aforementioned EKOS study. Concurrent or rescue therapies in identified studies, case series, and reports included intra-arterial thrombolytics, cerebral artery angioplasty, and stenting.

The NIHSS score was reported in 13 of 25 (52 percent) identified studies and mRS 2 was reported in 17 of 25 (68 percent) studies. NIHSS, mRS 2, and mortality endpoints were reported in 20 percent, 50 percent, and 50 percent of MERCI clot retriever; 100 percent, 100 percent, and 100 percent of Penumbra System; and 50 percent, 63 percent, and 63 percent of off-label device studies. Table C summarizes all identified reports of neurothrombectomy devices by device classification and the safety endpoint(s) evaluated. Other adverse events evaluated in the neurothrombectomy literature included perforation/ dissection, other types of hemorrhage (not intracerebral), thrombus formation (proximal, adjacent, or distal to the clot site), failure to deploy the device, device breakage/fracture, and vasospasm. During prospective or retrospective studies, the proportion ofpatients per study experiencing an instance of symptomatic or asymptomatic ICH, other bleeding, perforation or dissection, or thrombus formation were reported in 50 percent, 50 percent, 30 percent, 40 percent, and 20 percent of MERCI clot retriever, respectively; 100 percent, 71 percent, 29 percent, 43 percent, and 43 percent of Penumbra System; and 63 percent, 38 percent, 0 percent, 63 percent, and 38 percent of off-label device studies, respectively. Device failure-to-deploy, device fracture or breakage, and vasospasm data were infrequently reported in studies. Key Question 3: What are the variables associated with use of the devices that may impact outcomes (e.g. time to deployment, training/expertise of interventionalist, location of infarct, concurrent therapies)? The effects of predictor variables on select outcomes identified by researchers during neurothrombectomy studies are summarized in Table D.8Table D. Effect of various variables on post-neurothrombectomy device outcomes Clinical Outcomes NIHSS Predictor Variables Recanalization Improvement Hemorrhage* mRS 2Death Recanalization -B- B B Older Age --- H H Higher SBP -H- H H Higher Baseline NIHSS I-- H H ICA Occlusion Site I-- I H (vs. mostly MCA) Abnormal Hemostasis# I-I H I Prior IV rtPA I-I I I Concomitant IA thrombolytics B-I I I Prior Stroke --- - H Longer Procedure Duration --- H I Right Brain Infarct --- H - B=beneficial; by achieving TIMI 2-3 flow at the site of primary occlusion. Evaluated predictors of outcome (Table D) in these patients treated with a neurothrombectomy device include demographic, co-morbid disease, stroke severity, and stroke treatment variables. These predictors were evaluated in studies (or pooled analyses) of the MERCI clot retriever and the Penumbra System. Of particular note, recanalization was the only variable that was found to be predictive of clinical benefit (achieving a mRS 2) as well as lower mortality. These results are similar to those found in an earlier meta-analysis as well as a pooled analysis of the IMS I and II trials, where reduced-dose IV followed by IA thrombolysis was associated with good outcomes. In addition to these variables, researchers have suggested that the presence of collateral circulation, lesion volume, and cerebral perfusion pressure have also been linked to outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients.In a meta-analysis by Stead and colleagues evaluating neurothrombectomy devices, younger age and lower NIHSS score at presentation had beneficial effects on achieving a mRS 2 (p=0.001). Patients with posterior circulation occlusions were found to have higher odds of 90-day mortality compared to those with anterior occlusions (either internal carotid or middle cerebral arteries). No studies provided data assessing the relationship between the training of interventionalists and outcomes in patients treated with neurothrombectomy devices. However, studies of emerging technologies over the past 20 years have suggested that inadequate physician training and experience can adversely affect clinical outcomes. Of note, upon qualitative review, the proportion of patients recanalized in retrospective 9(real-world) studies did not appear to be lower than that of the prospective, single-arm studies, for either MERCI or Penumbra System studies. This suggests that practicing clinicians may be achieving outcomes similar to those clinicians involved with clinical trials, which would indicate that practicing clinicians are receiving adequate training. Two reports have been written and approved by multiple neuroscience societies detailing the minimum training requirements for those performing neuroendovascular procedures (including neurothrombectomy devices) in patients with acute ischemic stroke, and setting out performance standards that should be adopted to assess outcomes. Discussion Neurothrombectomy devices are a treatment option in patients with an acute ischemic stroke. The specific population most likely to benefit from these devices is still under investigation. Current studies have involved patients with large vessel occlusions, high baseline NIHSS scores, and those either unlikely to respond or who have failed IV rtPA therapy. Only two neurothrombectomy devices, the MERCI clot retriever and the Penumbra System, are cleared by FDA to restore perfusion in patients with acute ischemic stroke. A majority of available data relates to the two cleared devices. We did not identify any direct human comparative studies of neurothrombectomy devices to IV rtPA or each other. Instead, investigators frequently studied devices as part of prospective single-arm studies, non- comparative retrospective studies enrolling consecutive patients, or case series or case reports. In this technical brief, our main objective was limited to describing neurothrombectomy devices currently being used or actively investigated in the treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke and summarizing the evidence supporting their use. We did not draw conclusions regarding their effectiveness or safety. A previous systematic review of neurothrombectomy devices by Stead and colleagues was identified during our literature scan. The literature search on which their review was based extended only through March 2006 and consequently did not include the majority of the highest quality data on neurothrombectomy devices (including that of the MERCI and Penumbra Systems). Thus, our technical brief should represent the most up- to-date review of the literature at this time. Unlike our review, Stead and colleagues quantitatively compared pooled device results to a control group derived from their own institution's stroke population. They found that when compared with a similar matched cohort, the neurothrombectomy patients had good functional recovery (mRS 2) in 34.5 percent of patients compared with 10.7 percent of patients matched for age, sex, and NIHSS score, suggesting that the neurothrombectomy group was nearly 15 times more likely than the control group to have good functional recovery. While perhaps the best \"controlled\" data available to date, this analysis is fraught with limitations, including the fact that the neurothrombectomy cohort was not homogeneous, the comparison was to a single-center historically concurrent cohort, and individuals were not randomly allocated. Eleven ongoing studies are evaluating at least one neurothrombectomy device in acute ischemic stroke listed on the http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ Web site or mentioned in previous review articles. The first of these eleven studies is estimated to end sometime in 2010. All studies appear to be enrolling patients based upon inclusion and exclusion criteria that are similar to those already used by the prospective and retrospective studies detailed throughout this report. One exception is the Mechanical Retrieval and Recanalization of Stroke Clots Using Embolectomy (MR RESCUE) trial, which will allow patients to receive IV rtPA up to 4.5 hours after symptom onset. Seven of these studies have randomized, controlled designs with projected enrollment ranging from 20 to 900. The other four studies have prospective, observational designs ranging from 200 to 2000 projected participants. Six of the seven randomized controlled trials are allowing the use of multiple neurothrombectomy devices; most compare the use of neurothrombectomy devices to best medical therapy (with or without IV rtPA). Both the MERCI clot retriever and the Penumbra System have prospective observational studies in progress. Compared to previous, similarly designed studies of these agents, these studies will enroll much larger sample sizes (n=2,000 and 3,000, respectively).10 The use of advanced imaging techniques should be incorporated into future randomized controlled trials to aid in identifying those patients most likely to benefit from neurothrombectomy devices. In addition, for those patients with contraindications or who are refractory to IV rtPA, it is unclear which device is the most efficacious or safe. It would seem reasonable to conduct studies to answer such research gaps using a randomized controlled trial design, powered to show equivalency or non-inferiority of devices. These studies should also evaluate the impact on health-related quality of life of neurothrombectomy devices. Summary Currently available neurothrombectomy devices offer intriguing treatment options in patients with acute ischemic stroke, although a paucity of high quality research currently exists. There remains a need for further research on the topic, including randomized controlled trials to determine the optimal device(s) to use, and the patient populations most likely to benefit from their use. Additionally, studies of neurothrombectomy devices against contemporaneous controls investigating whether these devices truly treat final health outcomes associated with stroke rather than improving recanalization alone are warranted. Results of ongoing studies will likely only begin to address some of these questions.Full Report This executive summary is part of the following document: Baker WL, Colby JA, Tongbram V, Talati RA, Silverman IE, White CM, Kluger J, Coleman CI.

T hrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r t-PA) is licensed for treatment of acute ischaemic stroke in the early ho urs after symptom onset. It has been shown in randomised contr olled trials (RCTs) and the 2009 Cochrane review of thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke to reduce dependency but at the increased r isk of intracranial haemorrhage. Methods to reduce the risk of hae morrhage while retaining or enhancing the benet could increas e the use of thrombolytic treatment. While most available informa tion comes from RCTs of intravenous rt-PA at 0.9 mg/kg, it is pos sible that other doses, drugs and other routes of administration m ight increase benet and reduce the hazard. Objectives T o assess the risks and benets of different thrombolytic ag ents, doses and routes of administration for the treatment o f acute ischaemic stroke. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group T rials Register (May 2012 ), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2012) and EMBASE (1980 to May 2012). We handsearched journals and conference proceedings, sea rched ongoing trials registers and contacted pharmaceutical comp anies and researchers. Selection criteria Unconfounded randomised and quasi-randomised trials of diff erent doses of a thrombolytic agent, or different agents, or the same agent given by different routes, in people with conrmed acute ischaemic stroke. Data collection and analysis T wo review authors independently assessed trial eligibili ty and quality, and extracted the data using a structured profo rma. We cross- checked and resolved discrepancies by discussion to reach consensu s. We obtained translations and additional information fro m study authors where required. 1 Thrombolysis (different doses, routes of administration a nd agents) for acute ischaemic stroke (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2013 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Cerebral angioplasty and/or selective intra -arterial vasodilator therapy is reasonable in patients with symptomatic cerebral vasospasm, particularly those who are not rapidly responding to hypertensive therapy (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B ). 2) Deringer 2011 , Neurocritical Care Society consensus statement (PDF not included due to length) a. There was wide international variation in the use of endovascular therapies with some groups strongly recommending their use and other not utilizing them at all b. Recommendation: Endovascular treatment using intra -arterial v asodilators and/or angioplasty may be considered for vasospasm related DCI (moderate quality evidence -strong recommendation). c. Recommendation: The timing and triggers of endovascular treatment of vasospasm remains unclear, but generally rescue therapy for i schemic symptoms that remain refractory to medical treatment should be considered. The exact timing is a complex decision which should consider the aggressiveness of the hemodynamic intervention, the patients' ability to tolerate it, prior evidence of large artery narrowing, and the availability of and the willingness to perform angioplasty or infusion of intra -arterial agents (moderate quality evidence \u2014 strong recommendation). 3) Steiner 2013 , European S troke Organization guideline of treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage (PDF not included due to length) a. no recommendations for angioplasty or intra -arterial vasodilators Summary: Little evidence was found to support the use of balloon angioplasty (currently on covered line) or intra -arterial vasodilators (current code under review ), but both procedures are recommended as possible therapies by expert guidelines which rate the underlying evidence to be of moderate strength .

An electronic literature searchwas conducted to identify English language articles pub- lished through October 2010 that addressed endovascular management of vasospasm. A total of 49 articles wereidentied, addressing endovascular treatment timing, intra- arterial treatments, and balloon angioplasty. Most of the available studies investigated intra-arterial papaverine orballoon angioplasty. Both have generally been shown to successfully treat vasospasm and improve neurological condition, with no clear benet from one treatment com-pared with another. There are reports of complications with both therapies including vessel rupture during angioplasty, intracranial hypertension, and possible neurotoxicity asso-ciated with papaverine. Limited data are available evaluating nicardipine or verapamil, with positive benets reported with cerebral ischemia (DCI) account for the majority of morbidity and mortality forpatients who survive to undergo treatment following aneu- rysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Angiographic vasospasm is observed in 30-70% of patients between days5 and 14 following the initial aneurysmal bleed [ 1,2]. Approximately 50% of patients with angiographic vaso- spasm will develop DCI, with 15-20% of these patientssuffering stroke or death despite maximal therapy [ 3,4]. Medical management of vasospasm primarily consists of hemodynamic augmentation that is associated with signif-icant risks of complications, such as heart failure and pulmonary edema [ 5]. Endovascular therapies, such as intra-arterial vasodilator might benet patients with cerebral vasospasm when hemodynamic therapy has failed or when there is concern for complications of hemodynamic therapy. Despite the potential benet from endovascular therapy, clear guidelines directing use of these treatments forvasospasm after SAH are not available. The decision of when to intervene endovascularly is not clear and certain across all patients. A review of the medical literature wasconducted to determine the role of endovascular treatment in the management of cerebral vasospasm.

Box Gainesville, 74712 Magnetic resonance (eg, proton) imaging, fetal, including placental and maternal pelvic imaging when performed, first gestation 74713 each additional gestation Issue : The new fetal MRI CPT codes were discussed at the October, 2015 VBBS meeting. There was general consensus that these codes should be placed on line 1 PREGNANCY, with a guideline. HERC staff was asked to contact maternal -fetal medicine specialists and fetal radiologists to get input into the proposed guideline. Fetal MRI i s the use of MRI technology to evaluate abnormalities, generally after the abnormality has been detected by traditional fetal ultrasound. The major use of this technology appears to be in the evaluation of CNS abnormalities, gastroschi sis, and congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Currently, fetal MRI is coded with CPT codes for pelvic MRI (CPT 72192 -72197) which are diagnostic. Expert guidelines 1) American College of Radiology \u2014Society for Pediatric Radiology 2015 , guideline on fetal MRI (PDF not included due to length) a. When an anomaly is visualized by ultrasound but the etiology remains uncertain due to the nature of the abnormality, or due to sonographic limitations from fetal lie, maternal body habitus, oligohydramnios, or small field of view, MRI can add additional information that may impact parental counseling, management, and delivery planning b. Multiple possible indications listed c. Individuals interpreting fetal MR I should be familiar with both fetal and neonatal diagnoses d. Prior to 18 weeks gestational age the fetal MRI study can give limited diagnostic information due to the small size of the fetus and fetal movement. 2) Reddy 2014 , NIH/Society for Maternal -Fetal Medicine/ACOG/ACR/SPR /Society of Radiologists consensus statement on fetal MRI a. Targeted ultrasonography performed by an experienced sonologist must precede fetal MRI b. Interpretation m ust be done by individuals with expertise in obstetric imaging, fetal MRI, and pediatric imaging c. Fetal MRI is useful at further diagnosis or delineation of abnormalities in the CNS, face, neck, spine, chest, abdomen, and placenta. Fetal MRI has a useful role in assisting the planning of fetal surgery. d. Before 18 weeks of gestati onal age, fetal MRI is of limited benefit because of the small fetal size and fetal motion artifact. Magnetic resonance imaging at 20 -22 Fetal MRI 2 weeks is a useful adjunct to ultrasonography for better evaluation and management of known or suspected anomalies. The third trimester is the optimal time for assessment of cortical development and to assess airway compromise in neck masses. e. For the assessment of fetal anatomy, 1.5 Tesla equipment is used in conjunction with a fast T2 -weighted single -shot technique. f. Resear ch is needed for abnormalities in cases in which MRI may add additional information beyond that available with ultrasonography, such as assessing the effect of MRI in patients with obesity where a fetal survey is inadequate; establishing a threshold for sm all fetal head size where MRI could provide additional information; defining the conditions in which fetal MRI can aid in assessment, such as fetal lung volumes, chest masses, spinal abnormalities, and cardiac anatomy and function; defining the incremental benefit of MRI beyond ultrasonography in cases of anhydramnios; performing additional animal and human studies for safety of fetal MRI at 1.5 Tesla, 3 Tesla, and greater Tesla; and defining the role of MRI in fetuses exposed to adverse maternal environmen t (eg, uteroplacental insufficiency, infection). The optimal timing of MRI as well as the appropriate functional imaging tools, such as spectroscopy and diffusion tensor imaging, need further study. A final area of research is assessment of the placenta fo r distinguishing between small -for-gestational -age and growth - restricted fetuses, assessment of placenta accreta, and knowledge regarding placental metabolism. 3) Patenaude 2014 , Society of OB/Gyn Canada, practice guideline for the use of fetal MRI a. Fetal magn etic resonance imaging is safe at 3.0 tesla or less during the second and third trimesters. (II -2) b. The imaging team should consist of a technologist who fulfills the competency profile of the Canadian Association of Medical Radiation Technologists and has experience in fetal MRI, with specific training in MRI principles, sequences, and safety, and ideally a radiologist who is either trained or highly experienced in fetal MRI. c. Ideally, three orthogonal planes should be obtained through the fetal head and body in each sequence. The MRI protocol primarily includes T2 -weighted sequences. T1 -weighted, diffusion -weighted, and additional sequences may be added if indicated d. There are limitations in performing fetal MRI in obese patients e. in certain cases MRI may prov ide additional relevant clinical information that will facilitate perinatal counselling and management decisions f. Ultrasound remains the primary diagnostic tool for fetal imaging. Although MRI may provide additional relevant clinical information, fetal move ment can create artifacts leading to non -diagnostic images. MRI in the obstetric patient should only be done if the ultrasound assessment is inadequate for antenatal clinical management and the desired information is required in the fetal period; on occasi on it may replace neonatal MRI requiring general anaesthesia. MRI should only be performed and interpreted in centres with sufficient expertise following Fetal MRI 3 a careful review of all imaging and clinical information. During the first trimester of pregnancy, MRI should be used only as a clinically necessary precaution in the case of theoretical risks. No reviews found explicitly addressing fetal MRI at NICE, SIGN, CTAF. No policies found with Aetna, Cigna, or Blue Cross. Expert input: Brian Shaffer, Materna l-Fetal Medicine (MFM) at OHSU Recommends following the ACR guideline outlined above. (numbers refer to sections in the proposed guideline) 1)...the abnormalities should be found by an experienced Sonologist... sometimes we get referral for anomalies and the referring provider wants an MR but when we see the fetus - feel it's unnecessary..... 2)...I think the person making the decision should be experienced ---- we use MRI for very different anomalies -- from brain (most common) to complex GU - cloaca.... I believe experienced sonologist (MFM or radiologist) 3)...agree - at least 18 -- maybe 20 or 22...... 4) I think a bit more is needed here: MRI should be a 1.5 Tesla magnet and the executive summary recommends a team interpretation \"Furthermore, a team approach to the interpretation of fetal MRI is essential, with involvement of the referring physician and individuals with expertise in obstetric imaging, fetal MRI, and pediatric imaging\". There is an executive statement that frames this issue well (I ha ve pasted the salient comments below). Leo Pereira, MFM OHSU This is well thought out and timely I like points 1, 3, and 4 With regards to point 2 I think you need to be clear about what is meant by a fetal radiologist and how will it be documented that 2 physicians feel it's necessary ? Would y ou require 2 names on the order ? Keith Balderson, MFM in Eugene Recommended against having a radiologist as the gatekeeper. Recommended that the test be recommended by a MFM or not have a gatekeeper at all. Recom mended that the MRI technologist be experienced and knowledg eable, and the center be high volume .

Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies published in English and in French. There were no date restrictions. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to July 2013. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies. Values: The quality of evidence in this document was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (Table). Benefits, harms, and costs: This article is intended to reassure obstetric care providers that if used in an appropriate manner without the use of contrast agents, MRI in the obstetrical patient is safe for mother and fetus in the second and third trimesters. Because obstetrical MRI is expensive and has limited availability in Canada, this clinical guideline is intended to encourage the judicious use of this resource. Summary Statements 1. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging is safe at 3.0 tesla or less during the second and third trimesters. (II-2) 2. It is safe to continue breastfeeding after receiving a gadolinium contrast agent. (III) Recommendations 1. Use of magnetic resonance imaging during the first trimester of pregnancy should be restricted to maternal indications for which the information is considered clinically imperative. Inadvertent exposure to magnetic resonance imaging during the first trimester has not been associated with any long-term sequelae and should not raise clinical concern. (III-C) 2. Gadolinium contrast may be used in pregnant women when the benefits outweigh the potential risks. (III-C) Abstract Objective: To review the biological effects and safety of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the obstetric patient and to review procedural issues, indications, and contraindications for obstetrical MRI. Outcomes: This guideline is intended to reassure patients and clinicians of the safety of MRI in pregnancy and to provide a framework for its use.350 l APRIL JOGC AVRIL 2014SOGC ClINICAl PRACTICE GUIDElINE INTRODUCTION Ultrasound is currently the standard approach for the initial evaluation of fetal anatomy. It is an imaging modality that is widely available, is cost-effective, and allows real-time examination of the fetus.1 US has the advantage of providing better spatial resolution than many other imaging techniques including MRI. However, for a variety of reasons, US may not allow adequate assessment of a complex case or provide critical information for antenatal clinical management. MRI can provide additional information resulting in better counselling, management, and perinatal outcomes. 2 This guideline has been developed to discuss safety, pre-procedure counselling, procedural considerations, and indications in the use of obstetrical MRI. SAFETY OF MRI IN THE OBSTETRICAl PATIENT Maternal Risks Maternal risks associated with the use of MRI are the same as for non-pregnant patients.3,4 One safety consideration for the obstetrical patient is prolonged supine positioning. A gravid uterus of significant size can lead to hypotension due to compression of the inferior vena cava. This can be avoided by placing the patient in a lateral oblique or lateral decubitus position. Fetal/Neonatal Risks Theoretical fetal concerns include teratogenic and biological effects. It is known that MRI may cause effects at the cellular level from the induction of local electric fields, currents from static and time-varying magnetic fields, and tissue and cellular heating from RF fields. Most of the biological effects associated with exposure to RF fields are related to thermogenesis. The term \"specific absorption rate\" refers to the dosimetric absorption of RF power. During an MRI procedure, the SAR is influenced by many complex factors and variables including the strength of the static magnetic field, the type of RF pulse used, the repetition time, the type of transmitting RF coil used and volume of tissue contained within, and the anatomical region exposed, among other factors. 5 Other physiological, physical, and environmental factors include exposure length, the rate of energy deposition, physiological thermoregulatory response, concomitant illness, and local environmental conditions. 5 Limits are determined for SAR for each pulse sequence to ensure that the increase in body temperature is less than 0.5\u00b0C. Maternal and fetal temperatures remain within the specified limits even when sequences with higher SAR values are used, including when SAR increases significantly when using higher magnetic fields.Key to evidence statements and grading of recommendations, using the ranking of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care Quality of evidence assessment* Classification of recommendations I: Evidence obtained from at least one properly randomized controlled trialA.

Some animal studies have documented effects on the early fetus in terms of growth, miscarriages, and eye malformations. 6-8 The applicability of these animal models to humans has been questioned.9 The National Radiological Protection Board in the United Kingdom stipulates in its principles for the protection of patients and volunteers during MRI that it \"might be prudent to exclude pregnant woman during the first three months of pregnancy,\" 10 whereas the latest American College of Radiology guideline for safe MRI practices does not differentiate among the pregnancy trimesters, and states that all pregnant patients could undergo MRI as long as the benefits outweigh the risks.11 From a practical standpoint, MRI done during first trimester is usually performed for maternal indications and not for prenatal diagnosis. There are limited case reports of unplanned exposure to MRI in the first trimester of pregnancy. To date there is insufficient evidence to understand the true risks of first trimester exposure to the developing fetus. 8,12 Until these theoretical concerns can be appropriately addressed, we advocate a cautious approach to using obstetrical MRI in the first trimester. Second and third trimesters The high level of acoustic noise generated in an MRI system may be of concern for both mother and fetus. The attenuation of sound within the abdomen of a pregnant mother, and its effect on the fetus, is currently under investigation. 9 There are no reports of significant acoustic impairment resulting from exposure to prenatal MRI. Fetal MRI is typically performed at 1.5 T. The higher field strength of 3 T is also considered to be safe. 3 Artifacts may be more pronounced in the second and third trimesters due to the large amount of amniotic fluid and increased abdominal girth.13 There are no published studies of the long-term effects in human children who have had prenatal exposure at magnetic field strengths of 3 T or more.14 Summary Statement 1. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging is safe at 3.0 tesla or less during the second and third trimesters. (II-2) Recommendation 1. Use of magnetic resonance imaging during the first trimester of pregnancy should be restricted to maternal indications for which the information is considered clinically imperative. Inadvertent exposure to magnetic resonance imaging during the first trimester has not been associated with any long-term sequelae and should not raise clinical concern. (III-C)Use of contrast agents in obstetrical MRI Gadolinium is classified as a category C drug by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Intravenous gadolinium is teratogenic in animals at high and repeated doses. 14 Gadolinium crosses the placenta and is excreted by the fetal kidneys into the amniotic fluid, where it remains, exposing the developing fetus, particularly the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, for an extended period of time.15 The 2010 American College of Radiology guideline for safe MRI practices recommends that intravenous gadolinium be avoided during pregnancy and used only if it is judged absolutely essential. One example of appropriate use could be in an examination for placenta percreta when planned delivery is imminent and fetal exposure to gadolinium is thus limited. 16 The risks and benefits of gadolinium use must be discussed with the pregnant patient and referring clinician. 11 Despite animal data and concerns about the use of gadolinium in pregnancy, there have been no reported adverse human fetal effects. 17 However, many authors remain cautious about the use of gadolinium at any time in pregnancy. 13,18,19 Recommendation 2. Gadolinium contrast may be used in pregnant women when the benefits outweigh the potential risks. (III-C) Risks of oral contrast media administration during lactation In the postnatal period, it may be necessary to perform an MRI for maternal indications and contrast may be used in the lactating mother. A minimal amount of gadolinium is excreted in the breast milk: 99.2% Gandolinium excreted; only 0.1% of the maternal intravenous dose is found in the breast milk, and only 1% of this is subsequently absorbed by the infant. 14 In fact, the 2012 edition of the American College of Radiology manual on contrast media states that \"the available data suggest that it is safe for the mother and infant to continue breast-feeding after receiving such an agent.\" 14 A similar conclusion was reached by the Contrast Media Safety Committee of the European Society of Urogenital Radiology in 2005. 20 Summary Statement 2. It is safe to continue breastfeeding after receiving a gadolinium contrast agent. (III) PROCEDURAl CONSIDERATIONS Obstetrical MRI can be technically challenging to perform and interpret given the movement of the fetus and its variable lie and presentation.352 l APRIL JOGC AVRIL 2014SOGC ClINICAl PRACTICE GUIDElINE Technical Requirements The imaging team should consist of: 1. a technologist who fulfills the competency profile of the Canadian Association of Medical Radiation Technologists and has experience in fetal MRI, with specific training in MRI principles, sequences, and safety, and ideally 2. a radiologist who is either trained or highly experienced in fetal MRI. Standards for credentialing MRI physicians vary from province to province. In British Columbia, subspecialty MRI accreditation (such as fetal MRI), requires 3 months of full-time training. Selection of optimal sequences and interpretation of resulting images requires knowledge of fetal anatomy, pathology, development, and maturation, as well as experience in discriminating between artifacts and true pathology. Fetal MRI is operator-dependent and requires appropriate sequences tailored to the organ system and suspected pathology. The imaging protocol must be altered when the fetus moves or if new anomalies are detected in the course of the scan. In addition to investigating the anomaly in question, the operator should examine the entire fetus and intrauterine structures whenever possible. Ideally, three orthogonal planes should be obtained through the fetal head and body in each sequence. The MRI protocol primarily includes T2-weighted sequences. T1-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and additional sequences may be added if indicated, and ideally should provide documentation of the entire fetus as well as the placenta, uterus, and surrounding maternal structures. Repeated sequences may be required if the fetus moves. The field of view should be as small as possible without causing foldover artifacts. Slice thickness between 2.5 and 5 mm is used in examining most fetal structures. Thinner slices are possible but have adverse effects on signal- to-noise ratio. At present, the minimum voxel size that may be obtained with fetal MRI is 0.8 \u00d7 0.8 \u00d7 2.5 mm, with slice thickness and fetal-maternal movement the major limiting factors. These factors decrease resolution and may obscure structures smaller than 1 mm and create difficulties in accurately measuring small or thin structures. Pre-procedure Counselling Pre-procedure counselling and education is important prior to obstetrical MRI as it may help alleviate maternal anxiety. 21 Counselling should include discussions of the working diagnosis and the indications for the MRI as well as procedural details, such as the duration of the scan and the noise involved. A communication plan should be formulated to relay information to the patient from the interpreting physician via the primary caregiver as soon as reasonably possible. However, both patient and referring physician should understand that in view of the number of images acquired and the complexity of anatomical data, formulation of an opinion can take many hours and therefore the expectation of a prompt verbal report is in most cases unrealistic. Maternal and/or Fetal Sedation Patients may find the claustrophobic environment distressing, particularly if the exam is prolonged by fetal movement and repetitive sequences. In the past, maternal and or fetal sedation was frequently used in obstetrical MRI. With the development of ultrafast sequences, maternal and fetal sedation is no longer required except in extraordinary circumstances. Technical Considerations There are limitations in performing fetal MRI in obese patients. With increased body wall thickness, the signal- receiving elements of the coil are not close to the intrauterine regions of interest, and a larger field of view is required; therefore, signal and image resolution are not optimal. A large mother may not fit inside the MRI unit, particularly when placed in decubitus position. Maximum values for body size and weight vary among manufacturers; however, a body circumference of more than 140 cm and/or a weight of more than 140 kg may be problematic. MRI resolution can also be suboptimal if there are excessive fetal movements. Polyhydramnios can allow increased fetal movement, so should a decompression amniocentesis be performed for other clinical indications, a clinically indicated fetal MRI should be done as soon as reasonably possible following the decompression. INDICATIONS FOR OBSTETRICAl MRI US remains the primary diagnostic tool for the fetus, and MRI is an expensive and limited resource in Canada. However, in certain cases MRI may provide additional relevant clinical information that will facilitate perinatal counselling and management decisions. 22 The indications for fetal MRI cannot be easily defined as they depend on a number of factors including regional differences in perinatal management, experience of technicians and physicians, availability of obstetrical MRI, and access to in-utero fetal surgery. Indications for fetal MRI and technological advances are evolving rapidly and APRIL JOGC AVRIL 2014 l 353The Use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Obstetric Patient vary depending on the available expertise and the individual maternal-fetal pathology under investigation. Central Nervous System The fetal brain is well-observed on T2-weighted sequences because of the contrast between cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue. After 17 weeks, the advantages of MRI in diagnoses of both developmental and acquired intracranial abnormalities have been well established 23-25; however, diagnosis of some abnormalities may not be possible until after 24 weeks. Additional sequences such as T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging provide information about brain development, cell density, myelination, hemorrhage, and ischemic lesions. It should be noted that calcifications are not demonstrated on routine MRI sequences, and consultation with the radiologist is recommended if confirmation of sonographically suspected calcifications is required. Fetal Oropharynx and Face MRI can be used to assess oropharyngeal anatomy in conditions where airway patency may be compromised by masses or mandibular or other facial malformations. MRI is useful to confirm or diagnose an isolated cleft of the posterior palate. MRI may also be helpful in clarifying anatomy in other anomalies, such as atypical and orbital abnormalies. 26 Neck The position of neck masses relative to the fetal airway can be assessed using MRI, which can assist in managing delivery when an EXIT (ex-utero intrapartum treatment) procedure is being considered. Fetal goiter and thyroid position relative to neck masses can also be imaged on T1- and T2-weighted views. Thoracic Anomalies Sonography is the primary screening method for the detection of thoracic anomalies, mediastinal shift, and the presence of fluid in the pleural space. For malformations such as bronchopulmonary sequestration or congenital pulmonary adenomatoid malformation, MRI should be performed if fetal US cannot provide the information necessary for counselling or management. 27 In congenital diaphragmatic hernia, MRI can be used to evaluate lung volume and the presence of liver and intra-abdominal organs in the thorax.28-30 Pulmonary hypoplasia can be a significant contributor to neonatal mortality and morbidity, and so the antenatal assessment of lung growth and development maybe useful in predicting survival and may aid in perinatal management.Evaluation of the Fetal Heart Although sequences are being developed to evaluate cardiac structures and function, fetal echocardiography remains the method of choice for screening and prenatal diagnosis of cardiovascular anomalies. Intra-abdominal Anomalies MRI should be reserved for circumstances when fetal US cannot provide the information necessary for counselling or management. After 20 weeks, high signal from meconium on T1-weighted sequences forms the basis for an MRI colonography. This technique can confirm the presence of bowel within the thorax in congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and it can confirm obstruction and anorectal malformations. Calcifications in meconium peritonitis may be not on MRI. 31,32 Urogenital Tract Urogenital tract structures are readily visualized on US unless severe oligohydramnios or anhydramnios, fetal position, or other condition precludes adequate visualization of anatomy. MRI may be helpful in providing anatomical information in these situations. 33 Extremities and Bone US is the primary method of evaluating skeletal biometry and observing findings involving distal appendages. However, sequences have been developed to image musculoskeletal structures with MRI. 34 Spine US is the imaging modality of choice to screen for open neural tube defects. MRI can be used to confirm suspected anomalies of the spinal cord. 35 Maternal Conditions MRI provides images of maternal anatomy in 3 orthogonal planes without interference from bowel gas. Upper abdominal organs, bowel, kidneys, bladder, ovarian and adnexal masses, uterine anatomy, placental position, and cervical anatomy are visible, and additional targeted sequences can be obtained if necessary. MRI may be particularly useful when appendicitis is suspected clinically and US examination is negative. 36 Placental Adhesion Disorders The diagnosis of placental percreta can be made with either US or MRI. However, MRI is the imaging method of choice when there is a risk of posterior placenta increta or percreta. 37 SUMMARY Fetal MRI is an expensive and limited resource in Canada. Questions arise over its utility, indications, and safety in 354 l APRIL JOGC AVRIL 2014SOGC ClINICAl PRACTICE GUIDElINE the obstetrical patient. Ultrasound remains the primary diagnostic tool for fetal imaging. Although MRI may provide additional relevant clinical information, fetal movement can create artifacts leading to non-diagnostic images. MRI in the obstetric patient should only be done if the ultrasound assessment is inadequate for antenatal clinical management and the desired information is required in the fetal period; on occasion it may replace neonatal MRI requiring general anaesthesia. MRI should only be performed and interpreted in centres with sufficient expertise following a careful review of all imaging and clinical information. During the first trimester of pregnancy, MRI should be used only as a clinically necessary precaution in the case of theoretical risks. Gadolinium contrast can be used during pregnancy when it can provide critical information for the health of the mother and fetus. Although no documented adverse effects to the human fetus have been documented, gadolinium crosses the placenta and has teratogenic effects in animals. It is safe to breastfeed after receiving a gadolinium contrast agent. While screening for fetal anomalies and prenatal diagnostic imaging relies primarily on US, fetal MRI tailored to gestational age and suspected pathology has a complementary role in prenatal and perinatal management.

Gastric or colonic scintigraphy was the \"gold standard\" test 2) Szarka 2012 , review of testing for intestinal transit (PDF not included due to length) a. Bariums studies for small intestinal transit: small bowel transit time measured during barium radiography is inversely related to the volume of the barium administered, and what constitutes a normal barium small bowel transit time remains elusive because of lack of standardization of methods and definitions. In addition, contrast radiography studies provide substantial radiation exposure . b. Radiopaque markers for small intestinal transit: fairly simple and inexpensive, there may be difficulty in attributing th e position of the markers to a specific Gastric Emptying with Sm all/Large Bowel Transit 2 anatomical location within the gastrointestinal tract . Additionally, there is substantial radiation exposure with this method . c. Scintigraphy for small intestinal transit: scintigraphy provides physiological and quantitative information. Of the methods reviewed thus far, scintigraphy has yielded the most reliable results. Disadvantages are lack of standardization in clinical practice, lack of general application, the wide range of norma l values, and a potential pitfall in interpretation when gastric emptying and/or colonic transit are delayed . d. Radiopaque markers for colonic transit: The advantages of radiopaque marker colon transit tests are the wel l-established normal values and standar dization of methods; it is also readily available and reasonably inexpensive. Disadvantages include the radiation exposure and multiple visits for the 1 to 3 abdominal x -rays that may be required. It is also possible that the solid markers may move through the colon differently than stool. The localization of the markers relative to bone landmarks may not reflect their true position in the colon. These criticisms notwithstanding, the radiopaque markers are the reference standard for colon transit evaluation in clinical practice . e. Scintigraphy for colonic transit: In summary, scintigraphic assessment of colonic transit provides a noninvasive, safe, and relatively rapid (24 or 48 hours) assessment of whole colon and regional colonic transit. The technique is we ll validated and used in clinical practice and in numerous research studies. Disadvantages include radiation exposure, expense, and the limited availability of radiopharmaceuticals, gamma camera detection equipment, and operator expertise in tertiary medic al centers.

However, the NCCN table has the caveat that even those tests without evidenc e to support their use might be useful in specific clinical situations. There was discussion about using panel testing versus using customized testing for certain genes. The advisory panel felt that panels are useful in some situations, and the more spec ific testing might be all that is indicated in other situations. However, the panel tests are frequently the same price as more specific tests. GAP felt that the panel tests above may be more cost effective that singling out the specific tests called out by NCCN as evidence based. Myriad representatives testified that 81432 and 81433 are not priced by Medicare and therefore will likely not be billable for 2016. A miscellaneous genetic testing CPT code will likely to be used instead. 7) HERC staff /GAP recomme ndation: a. Add 81162, 81432 -81433 to the Diagnostic Procedures File b. Add these codes to the relevant section of the non-prenatal genetic testing guideline 2016 Genetic Testing CPT Code R eview 2 81412 Ashkenazi Jewish carrier testing 1) 81412: Jewish group C, Gaucher disease, Tay - Sachs disease), genomic sequence analysis panel must include sequencing of at least for use for preconception/early pregnancy testing when both parents are of Asheknazi Jewish ancestry or the spouse is a known Ashkenazi Jewish genetic disorder carrier or when there is a known family history of an Ashkenaz i Jewish genetic disorder .

Screening for cystic fibrosis carrier status once in a lifetime (CPT 81220 - 81224) b. #15. Screening those with GAP discussion: The group discussed \"pan -ethnic\" testing, which is becoming increasingly common. These tests are large panels which include genetic defects seen in different genetic groups. \"Pan -ethnic\" testing is quickly becoming the preferred method to test, due to difficulty in determining a patient's ethnic background, as well as the fa ct that \"pan -ethnic\" testing is frequently less expensive than more targeted testing. However, these types of large panel tests have the possibility of finding mutations of questionable significance, or may provide information that the patient/family does not desire to know. There was a question about whether specific Ashkenazi Jewish testing panels will continue to be used, or whether pan -ethnic panels will become the standard. The specific use of this test for prenatal testing was discussed in the con text of the Prenatal Testing Guideline. This guideline specifically prohibits the use of panels that include tests not specifically approved in the guideline. Based on this wording, GAP felt that the Ashkenazi Jewish panel could not be added to the Prena tal Genetic Testing Guideline. They recommended that this guideline be brought back through the Coverage Guidance process, with specific attention paid to whether larger panel testing should be allowed for all types of prenatal testing as well as specific ally for Ashkenazi Jewish patient screening. The Prenatal Genetic Testing Guideline review should also include a discussion about whether pre -conception testing should fall under this guideline or under the non -prenatal genetic testing guideline. Update: after internal discussions, and review of the prenatal genetic testing workgroup deliberations, HERC staff determined that the prenatal genetic testing guideline should be altered to allow Ashenazi Jewish panel testing, if such testing is the same or lowe r cost as the already 2016 Genetic Testing CPT Code R eview 3 included components of such a panel. Such a panel was not felt to conflict with previous prenatal genetic testing discussions, which had touched on coverage of this specific panel. There was also an equity issue that coverage of Ash kenazi Jewish testing should be the same regardless of whether the testing is done as a preconception test or as part of prenatal testing. The GAP concern about limiting other panel tests for prenatal genetic testing will be brought back to that coverage guidance workgroup when it is convened. GAP members pointed HERC staff to the American College of Medical Genetics guideline on preconception counseling for information on the probability of each of these types of tests being positive. The decision was made to cover this test for pre -conception counseling, with restrictions added to the Non -Prenatal Genetic Testing Guideline D1. Update: changes were added to both the prenatal and non -prenatal genetic testing guidelines. 5) HERC staff /GAP recommendation: a. Add 81412 to the Diagnostic Procedures File b. Amend the Non -Prenatal Genetic Testing Guideline and the Prenatal Genetic Testing Guideline to allow testing only when the panel test is used in place of individual tests and is of similar or lower cost than the i ndividual tests. 81434 Hereditary retinal disorders 1) 81434: Hereditary analysis panel, must include sequencing of at least 15 genes, inclu ding of these genes currently have specific CPT codes. USH2A is included in a non - symdromic hearing loss panel (CPT 81430) 3) GAP discussion: This appears to be a minimal list of genes to include in a panel; most panels have far more genes. This type of testing influences management significantly . 4) HERC staff/GAP recommendation: a. Add 81434 Procedures 81437 -81438 Hereditary neuroend ocrine tumor disorders 1) disorders medullary thyroid carcinoma, parathyroid carcinoma, malignant pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma ); genomic sequence analysis panel, must include sequencing of at least 6 genes, in cluding MAX, SDHB, SDHD, TMEM127 4 2) 81438: Hereditary neuroendocrine tumor disorders (eg, medullary carcinoma, parathyroid carcinoma, malignant pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma SDHC, SDHD, and VHL 3) Gap input: testing is appropriate, will change management or screening 4) HERC staff /GAP recommendation: a. Add 814 37-81438 to the Diagnostic Procedures File 81442 Noonan spectrum disorder testing 1) Noonan spectrum disorders (eg, Noonan Syndrome, cardio -facio - cutaneous syndrome, Costello syndrome, LEOPARD Syndrome, Noonan -like syndrome), genomic sequence analysis panel , must include sequencing of at i. Validation study of multi gene sequencing for Noonan Syndrome ii. Conclusion: Here we show how molecular testing of RASopathies by targeted NGS could allow an early and accurate diagnosis for all enrolled patients, enabling a prompt diagnosis , especially for those patients with mild, non-specific or atypical features in whom the detection of the causative mutation usually requires prolonged diagnostic timings when using standard routine. This approach strongly impro ved genetic counselling and clinical management. 2) GAP discussion: This is an important test to cover. The test will affect management, as some genes affect cancer risk and patients will need surveillance for these cancers if positive. The gene list in this panel is reasonable. The single genetic defe ct PTPN11 is positive in 50% of kids, but cost difference between this test and whole panel is only about $100. Requiring testing for PTPN11 first, and then the panel if negative, will delay testing and treatme nt. 3) HERC staff /GAP recommendation: a. Add 81442 to the Diagnostic Procedures File Non -Prenatal Genetic Testing Guideline The non -prenatal genetic testing guideline was reviewed at the October 13, 2015 Genetics Advisory Panel meeting. The following issues were reviewed and the changes below were approved by the GAP members. These issues were raised by GAP members, CCO medical directors, and others during the past year. Issues : 1) The NCCN guideline references need to be updated 2) OHP medical directors requested that the non -prenatal gen etic testing guideline have a section adde d listing the CPT codes for genetic tests that are currently covered as diagnostic witho ut restrictions a. The GAP and HERC staff felt that adding a comprehensive list of covered CPT codes would be too time inte nsive to be practical and too prone to error . GAP instead recommended adding a clause at the beginning of the guideline noting that all codes not restricted or excluded are diagnostic an d covered if they meet the crit eria in the guideline 3) HERC staff suggested deleting the genetic testing algorithm and incorporating the intent into the guideline itself a. It appears to be unconnected to D1 and difficult to use by the CCOs 4) OHP medical directors requested that the non -prenatal genetic testing guideline list the training requirements for the clinician ordering the genetic test, as well as for the genetic counseling providers . There is concern that OB/Gyns, primary care physicians, and surgeons are ordering tests without appropriate training a. GAP did not agree with adding any additional requirements for clinicians ordering these tests. GAP members did not feel that there was an adequate genetic testing workforce for requiring counseling for all testing. Som e of these tests are time sensitive and genetic counseling is too long a process . The GAP members felt that there was no good way to specify training required for non - genetic professionals. 5) OHP medical directors requested consideration of adding wording requiring the most cost-effective testing (single test instead of a panel if the panel is not indicated, or panel testing rather than a consecutive series of single tests a. An existing claus e at end of guideline was moved to the beginning and made to apply t o all testing, not just the CPT codes listed in that section. 6) HERC staff have identified discrepancies between the prenatal and non -prenatal genetic testing guidelines sections on CF screening. The prenatal guideline specifies carrier screening will only be done once in a lifetime. Additionally, there were restrictions in the non -prenatal genetic testing guideline for CPT 81224 which were deleted during a review of the CF clauses in June, 2012, apparently by mistake. This code remains diagnostic without any restrictions. Non -Prenatal Genetic Testing Guideline HERC staff /GAP recommendations : 1) Modify the non -prenatal genetic testing guideline as shown below a. Update the NCCN references b. Update the BRCA testing clauses to reflect new CPT codes and the broadening of the spectrum of breast/ovarian cancer syndromes c. Move the restriction for the least costly test with required sensitivity from the end of the guideline to the beginning and have apply to all testing d. Add a clause recommending that cancer survivors have access to genetic counseling . Gene tic testing in this group can influence screening for the same or other cancer conditions (for example, some breast cancer syndromes have a higher risk of colon cancer and require a different colon cancer screening frequency). e. Add a clause regarding covera ge of Ashkenazi panel testing only when the panel replaces and is of similar/lower cost to individual gene testing f. CF section edits i. Add a restriction for CF carrier screening to once in a lifetime to bring into agreement with the prenatal genetic testing g uideline ii. Reinstate previous restrictions on CPT 81224 apparently deleted in error iii. Consider adding CPT 81221 (known familial variants) to this section or have GAP address any restrictions on this code at their next meeting 2) Delete the genetic testing algorit hm D1 and incorporate the intent into the beginning of the non -prenatal genetic testing guideline a. Specify that pre - and post -test genetic counseling is required in most cases b. Add a clause that genetic tests not otherwise excluded or restricted are covered if the genetic testing algorithm criteria (as now incorporated into this guideline) are met 3) Discuss modifying the requirement for a 10% change of a genetic abnormality from the guideline. GAP members find that this is a very high bar, as many genetic dise ases have a very low probability even in patients with very abnormal physical exams, tests, etc. GAP suggested that \"reasonable suspicion\" be considered instead. Non -Prenatal Genetic Testing Guideline DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINE D1, NON -PRENATAL GENETIC TESTING GUIDELINE Coverage of genetic testing in a non -prenatal setting shall be determined by the algorithm shown in Figure C.1 unless otherwise specified below. A) Genetic tests are covered as diagnostic, unless they are listed below in section F1 as excluded or have other restrictions listed in this guideline . To be covered, initial screening (e.g. physical exam, medical history, family history, laboratory studies, imaging studies) must indicate that the chance of genetic abnormality is > 10% and results would do at least one of the following: 1) Change treatment, 2) Change health monitoring, 3) Provide prognosis, or 4) Provide information needed for genetic counseling for patient; or patient's parents, siblings, or children B) Pretest and posttest genetic counseling is required for presymptomatic and predisposition genetic testing. Pretest and posttest genetic evaluation (which includes genetic counseling) is covered when provided by a suitable trained health professional with e xpertise and experience in genetics. 1) \"Suitably trained\" is defined as board certified or active candidate status from the American Board of Medical Genetics, American Board of Genetic Counseling, or Genetic Nursing Credentialing Commission. C) A more expensi ve genetic test (generally one with a wider scope or more detailed testing) is not covered if a cheaper (smaller scope) test is available and has, in this clinical context, a substantially similar sensitivity. For example, do not cover CFTR gene sequencing as the first test in a person of Northern European Caucasian ancestry because the gene panels are less expensive and provide substantially similar sensitivity in that context. D) Related to genetic testing for patients with breast/ovarian and colon/endometr ial cancer or other related cancers suspected to be hereditary, or patients at increased risk to due to family history. 1) Services are provided according to the Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines. a) Lynch syndrome (hereditary colorectal, endometrial and o ther cancers associated with be provided as defined by the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for women without a personal history of breast, ovarian and other associated cancers should be provided to high risk women as defined by the US Preventive Services Task Force or according to the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: Genetic/Fami lial Hi . Non -Prenatal Genetic Testing Guideline c) BRCA1/BRCA2 Breast and ovarian cancer syndrome genetic 81211 -81217 , 81432 -81433 ) for women with a personal history of breast, ovarian, and other associated cancers and for men with breast cancer should be provided according to the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology. Genetic/Familial High -Risk should be provided as defined by the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in 5/1/15 ). www.nccn.org . 2) Genetic counseling should precede genetic testing for hereditary cancer whenever possible. a) Pre and post -test genetic counseling should be covered when provided by a suitable trained health profess ional with expertise and experience in cancer genetics. Genetic counseling is recommended for cancer survivors when test results would affect cancer screening . i) \"Suitably trained\" is defined as board certified or active candidate status from the American Bo ard of Medical Genetics, American Board of Genetic Counseling, or Genetic Nursing Credentialing Commission. b) If timely pre -test genetic counseling is not possible for time -sensitive cases, appropriate genetic testing accompanied by pre - and post - test infor med consent and post -test disclosure performed by a board -certified physician with experience in cancer genetics should be covered. i) Post -test genetic counseling should be performed as soon as is practical. 3) If the mutation in the family is known, only the test for that mutation is covered. For example, if a mutation for BRCA 1 has been identified in a family, a single site mutation analysis for that mutation is covered (CPT 81215), while a full sequence BRCA 1 and 2 (CPT 81211) analyses is not. There is one exception, for individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry with a known mutation in the family, the panel for Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA mutations is covered (CPT 81212 ). 4) Costs for rush genetic testing for hereditary breast/ovarian and colon/endometrial cancer is not covered. E) Related to diagnostic evaluation of individuals with intellectual disability (defined as a full scale or verbal IQ < 70 in an individual > age 5), developmental delay (defined as a cognitive index <70 on a standardized test appropriate for c hildren < 5 years of age), Autism Spectrum Disorder, or multiple congenital anomalies: 1) CPT 81228, variants for chromosomal abnormalities: Cover for diagnostic evaluation of individuals with intellectual disability/developmental delay; multiple congenital anomalies; or, Autism Spectrum Disorder accompanied by at least one of the following: dysmorphic features including macro or microcephaly, congenital anomalies, or intellectual disability/devel opmental delay in addition to those required to diagnose Autism Spectrum Disorder. 2) CPT 81229, Cytogenomic constitutional microarray plus cytogenetic constitutional microarray analysis gle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants for chromosomal abnormalities: Cover for individuals with intellectual disability/developmental delay; multiple congenital anomalies; or, Autism Spectrum Disorder accompanied by at least o ne of the following: dysmorphic features including macro or microcephaly, congenital anomalies, or intellectual disability/developmental delay in addition to those required to diagnose Autism Spectrum Disorder; only if (a) consanguinity and recessive disea se is suspected, or (b) uniparental disomy is suspected, or (c) another mechanism is suspected that is not detected by the copy number variant test alone. 3) CPT 81243, 81244, Fragile X genetic testing is covered for individuals with intellectual disability/d evelopmental delay. Although the yield of Fragile X is 3.5 - 10%, this is included because of additional reproductive implications. 4) A visit with the appropriate specialist (often genetics, developmental pediatrics, or child neurology), including physical ex am, medical history, and family history is covered. Physical exam, medical history, and family history by the appropriate specialist, prior to any genetic testing is often the most cost -effective strategy and is encouraged. F) Related to other tests with specific CPT codes: 1) The following tests are not gene analysis, drug metabolism), gene drug metabolism), ge ne analysis, (eg, CPT 81504, Oncology (tissue of origin), microarray gene expression profiling of > 2000 genes, utilizing formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded tissue, algorithm reported as tissue similarity scores Non -Prenatal Genetic Testing Guideline 2) The following tests are covered only if they meet the criteria in section A above for the Non -Prenatal Genetic Testing Algorithm AND the specified situ common variants (eg, R183P, G278S, E422X): Cover only when the newborn screening test is abnormal and serum amino acids a re normal b) Diagnostic testing for cystic fibrosis (CF) with a positive newborn screen for cystic fibrosis or who are symptomatic for cystic fibrosis, or fo r clients that have previously been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis but have not had genetic testing, CFTR gene analysis of a panel containing at least the mutations recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics* (CPT 81220) is covered. If two mutations are not identified, CFTR full gene sequencing (CPT 81223) is covered. If two mutations are still not identified, duplication/deletion testing (CPT 81222) is covered. These tests may be ordered as refl ex testing on the same specimen. c) Carrier testing for cystic fibrosis i) CFTR gene analysis of a panel containing at least the mutations recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics* (CPT 81220) is covered once infertility): Covered after genetic counseling. e) CPT 81240. F2 (prothrombin, coagulation factor II) (eg, analysis, 20210G>A variant: Factor 2 202 10G>A testing should not be covered for adults with idiopathic venous thromoboembolism; for asymptomatic family members of patients with and a Factor V Leiden or Prothrombin 20210G>A mutation; or for determining the etiology or Leiden variant: Factor V Leiden testing should not be covered for: adults with idiopathic venous thromoboembolism; for asymptoma tic family members of patients with venous thromboembolism and a Factor V Leiden or Prothrombin 20210G>A mutation; or for determining the etiology C282Y, H63D): Covered for diagnostic testing of patients with elevated transferrin saturation or ferritin levels. Covered for predictive testing ONLY when a first degree family member has treatable iron overload variants (eg, *S and *Z): The alpha -1-antitrypsin protein level should be Non -Prenatal Genetic Testing Guideline the first line test for a suspected diagnosis of AAT deficiency in symptomatic individuals with unexplained liver disease or obstructive lung disease that is not asthma or in a middle age individual with unexplained dyspnea. Generic testing or the anpha -1 phenotype test is appropriate is the protein test is abnormal or borderline. The genetic test is appropriate for siblings of people with AAT deficiency regardless of the AAT protein test results. i) CPT 81415 -81416, exome testing: A genetic counseling/geneticist consul prior to ordering test j) CPT 81430 -81431, Hearing genomic panel: Testing for mutations in GJB2 and GJB6 need to be done first and be negative in non -syndromic patients prior to panel testing. k) is required prior to ordering test. l) 81412 Ashkenazi Jewish carrier testing panel: panel testing is o nly covered when the panel would replace and would be of similar or lower cost than individual gene testing including CF carrier testing . m) Do not cover a more expensive genetic test (generally one with a wider scope or more detailed testing) if a cheaper (smaller scope) test is available and has, in this clinical context, a substantially similar sensitivity. For example, do not cover CFTR gen e sequencing as the first test in a person of Northern European Caucasian ancestry because the gene panels are less expensive and provide substantially similar sensitivity in that context. * American College of Medical Genetics Standards and Guidelines f or Clinical Genetics Laboratories. 2008 Edition, Revised 3/2011 and found at https://www.acmg.net/StaticContent/SGs/CFTR%20Mutation%20Testing.pdf ANCILLARY/DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINE NOTES FOR THE OCTOBE R 1, 2015 PRIORITIZED LIST OF HEALTH SERVICES 9-24-2015 Page AD-8 FIGURE D1 NON -PRENATAL GENETIC TESTING ALGORITHM (See Guideline Note D1 ) 1. Examples of initial screening: physical exam, medical history, family history, laboratory studies, imaging studies. Initial screening indicates genetic testing may be indicated. 1 Yes Pretest genetic risk assessment and/or clinical evidence indicate chance of genetic abnormality is > 10% and results would do at least one of the following: Change treatment, Change health monitoring, Provide prognosis, or Provide information needed for genetic counseling for patient ; or patient's parents, siblings, or children . No Yes Pretest and posttest genetic counseling is required for presymptomatic and predisposition genetic testing. Pretest and posttest genetic evaluation (which includes genetic counseling) is covered . Genetic test is covered . Genetic Test is not covered No PRENATAL GENETIC TESTING GUIDELINE The Genetics Advisory Panel meeting and subsequent staff review has found several issues with the prenatal genetic testing guideline tht need to be addressed. 1) The Ashkenazi Jewish testing section should be modified to agree with the non -prenatal genetic testing guideline 2) The CF testing section should have 2 CPT codes deleted. These codes are used for the diagnostic testing for suspected CF cases, not for genetic carrier screening. a. 81220 is the general CF carrier screen ing test, 81221 is the test for patients with known familial 81222 ( full gene sequence ) are used only for the work up of suspected CF and are 3rd line and 2nd line testing respectively DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELI NE D17, PRENATAL GENETIC TESTING The following types of prenatal genetic testing and genetic counseling are covered for pregnant women: 1.

Centola 2015 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23585841 (not included in packet due to study's length) i. Development of the 12 biomarker algorithm ii. Multibiomarker statistical models outperformed individual biomarkers at estimating disease activity. Biomarker -based scores were significantly correlated with DAS28 -CRP and could discriminate patients with low vs. moderate/high clinical disease activity. Such scores were also able to track changes in DAS28 -CRP and were significantly associated with both joint inflammation meas ured by ultrasound and damage progression measured by radiography. The final multibiomarker disease activity (MBDA ) algorithm uses 12 biomarkers to generate an MBDA score between 1 and 100. No significant effects on the MBDA score were found for common comorbidities. iii. Conclusion: We followed a stepwise approach to develop a quantitative serum -based measure of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity, based on 12 -biomarkers, which was consistently associated with clinical disease activity levels. b. Michaud 2015 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25877911 (not included in packet due to study's length) i. Study of the RA MBDA blood test on clinical progression and cost of treatment ii. Use of the MBDA test is projected to improve health assessment questionnaire ( HAQ ) scores by 0.09 units in year 1, declining to 0.02 units after 10 years. Over the 10 year time horizon, quality -adjusted life years increased by 0.08 years and costs decreased by US$457 (cost savings in disability -related medical costs, US$659; in producti vity costs, US$2137). The most influential variable in the analysis was the effect of the MBDA test on clinician treatment recommendations and subsequent HAQ changes. iii. Conclusion. The MBDA test aids in the assessment of disease activity in patients with RA by changing treatment decisions, improving the functional status of patients and cost savings. Further validation is ongoing and future longitudinal studies are warranted. c. Hambardzumyan 2015 http: //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812287 (not included in packet due to study's length) i. Study of MBDA score, based on 12 serum biomarkers as a baseline predictor for 1 -year rheumatoid progression ( RP) in early RA Disease Management Genetic Tests 2 ii. MBDA score was an independent predictor of RP as a continuous (OR=1.05, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.08) and dichotomised variable (high versus low/moderate, OR=3.86, 95% CI 1.04 to 14.26). iii. Conclusions: In patients with early RA, the MBDA score at baseline was a strong independent predictor of 1 -year RP. These results suggest that when choosing initial treatment in early RA the MBDA test may be clinically useful to identify a subgroup of patients at low risk of RP. 3) Summary: test is in the development stage, with clinical utility still being determined 4) HERC staff recommendation: a.

Myocardial perfusion imaging alone and the 1 -threshold strategy are weakly dominated. In sensitivity analysis, ICERs fall as the probability of oCAD increases from the base case value of 15%. The ranking of Disease Management Genetic Tests 3 ICERs among strategies is sensitive to test costs, including the time cost for testing. The analysis reveals ways to improve on pre -speci fied GES thresholds. iii. Conclusions : Diagnostic testing for oCAD with a novel GES strategy in a 2-threshold model is cost effective by conventional standards. This diagnostic approach is more efficient than usual care of myocardial perfusion imaging alone or a 1-threshold GES strategy in most scenarios. 4) Summary: test is in the development stage, with clinical utility still being determined 5) HERC staff recommendation: a.

Medical Policy Subject: Laboratory Testing as an Aid in the Di agnosis of Heart Transplant Rejection Policy #: TRANS.00025 Current 07/07/2015 Status: Reviewed Description/Scope This document addresses specific noninvasive laborat ory tests for the early detection of rejection following a heart transplant. This includes the Heartsbreath test (Menssana Research, Inc. Fort Lee, NJ), which measures the chemical byproducts of allograft rejection and has been investigated to potentially make the process of monitoring heart transplant recipients safer and less complicated. Also addressed in this document is the AlloMap \u00ae molecular expression testing (XDx, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) which has also been investigated as a noninvasive method of determining the risk of rejection in heart transplant recipients. Even with modern drug therapy, rejection remains a constant hazard, and transplant recipients must be tested repeatedly for signs of renewed rejecti on. Currently, the gold standard to detect heart transplant rejection is endomyocardi al biopsy. This is typically performed weekly for the first 6 weeks, biweekly until the third month, monthly to 6 months and then every 1 to 3 months, as indicated. Position Statement Medically Necessary: AlloMap molecular expressi on testing is considered medically necessary as a non-invasive method of determining the risk of rejection in heart tr ansplant recipients between 1 and 5 years post- transplant. Investigational and Not Medically Necessary: Breath testing with the Heartsbreath test is considered investigational and not medically necessary for use as an aid in the diagnos is of heart transplant rejection. AlloMap molecular expressi on testing is considered investigational and not medically necessary when the criteria above are not met. Rationale Breath Test Heartsbreath (Breath test for Grade 3 heart tr ansplant rejection), manufactured by Menssana Research, Inc., (Fort Lee, NJ) received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance on February 24, 2004 under the Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE)* program with the following indications for use: The Heartsbreath test is indicated for use as an aid in the diagnosis of grade 3 heart transplant rejection in patients who have received heart transplants within the preceding year. The Heartsbreath test is intended for use as an adjunc t to, and not as a substi tute for, endomyocardial biopsy. The use of the device is limited to patients who have ha d endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) within the previous month (FDA, 2004). The Heartsbreath test works on the principle that rejection of the transplanted heart is accompanied by oxidative stress that degrades membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids, evolving alkanes and methylalkanes that are excreted in the breat h as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The individual breathes for 2 minutes through a dispos able mouthpiece attached to a breath collecting device, which then analyzes the VOCs in alveolar and room air and interprets the values, using a proprietary algorithm to predic t the probability of Grade 3 heart transplant rejection. The Heartsbreath test should not be used for indivi duals who have received a heart transplant more than 1 year ago, or have a Grade 4 heart transp lant rejection, because Heartsbreath has not been evaluated in these groups.Page 1 of 7 TRANS.00025 Laboratory Testing as an Aid in the Diagnosis of Heart Transplant Reject i... 10/6/2015 file://dhs.sdc.pvt/HSB/OHPR%20HERC% 20Public/DBIssues/2015/2016%20CPT%20co d...FDA clearance was based on the results of the Heart Allograft Rejection: Detection with Breath Alkanes in Low Levels (HARDBALL) Study, wh ich was sponsored by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. In this 3 year multicenter st udy, investigators evaluate d a new marker of heart transplant rejection, the breath methylated alkane contour (BMAC). In the HARDBALL study, 1061 breath VOC samples were collected from 539 hear t transplant recipients at seven sites on the day of scheduled EMB. The gold standard of re jection was the concordant set of International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISH LT) grades in biopsies read by two cardiac pathologists. Results incl uded concordant biopsies of: 1A, 197 (18.6%); Grade 1B, 2, 93 (8.8%); Grade 3A, 42 (4.0%). A combination of 9 VOCs in the BMAC identified Grade 3 5.6%; negative predictive value 97.2%). Site pathologists identified the same cases with sensitivity of 42.4%, speci ficity 97.0%, positive predictive va lue 45.2% and negative predictive value 96.7%. The authors concluded that a breath test for markers of oxidative stress was more sensitive and less specific for Grade 3 heart transplant rejection than a biopsy reading by a single on-site pathologist, but the negati ve predictive values of the tw o tests were similar. They concluded that a negative screening breath test c ould potentially identify tr ansplant recipients at low risk of Grade 3 rejection and obviate the n eed for EMB in this group, thereby reducing the overall number of EMBs performed, which was es timated to be by as much as 50% (Phillips, 2004). Currently, there is inadequate evidence in th e published literature to demonstrate the safety, efficacy, and clinical utility of the Heartsbreath test in the management of rejection surveillance following heart transplant. Large trials are needed to further define the role of this technology and demonstrate how use of this test will impact treatment management. AlloMap Molecular Expression Testing The AlloMapmolecular expression blood test was de veloped by XDx, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). In 2008, FDA 510( k) clearance as a Class II approval was granted for AlloMap Molecular Expression Testing as an in-vitro, diagnostic, multivariate, index assa y test service, which assesses the gene expression profile of RNA isolated from peripheral blood m ononuclear cells for the following indication: To aid in the identification of heart transplant r ecipients with stable al lograft function who have a low probability of moderate/sev ere acute cellular rejection (ACR) at the time of testing in conjunction with standard clinical assessment. Al loMap is indicated for use in heart transplant recipients who are 15 years of ag e or older and at least 2 months (greater than or equal to 55 days) post-transplantation (FDA, 2008). The test assesses the expression of 20 genes, about half of which are direct ly involved in rejection while the remainder provide other in formation needed for rejection ri sk assessment. It is hoped the results of this test will decrease the number of necessary EMBs. Among the proposed benefits are the AlloMap test's ability to differentiate mild rejection, for which hist ologic findings may be the least accurate, and the potential fo r monitoring physiologic responses to steroid weaning. It has been recognized that the test is not effective at monitoring rejection within the first 6 months of transplantation, and it is yet unclear what a high AlloMap score might mean in the setting of no histologic rejection. These patterns of gene expression, detected in peripheral blood by the AlloMap testing, were studied in the Cardiac Allograf t Rejection Gene Expression Ob servation Study (CARGO), which included eight U.S. cardiac transplant centers wher e 650 heart transplant recipients were tested. Results of the CARGO study have appeared in ab stracts presented at th e 2005 annual meeting of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transpla ntation. While the results were promising, the data was considered inadequate to permit firm scie ntific conclusions regardi ng how use of this test will impact the manageme nt of heart transplant recipients (Deng, 2006). There have been subsequent validation studies and sub-study analyses of the CARGO results which provided additional data regarding the potenti al utility of the AlloMap test in detecting transp lant rejection (Bernstein, 2007; Mehra, 2007b; Mehra, 2008). Results of another trial were published in 2010. The Invasi ve Monitoring Attenuation through Gene Expression (IMAGE) trial , which was s ponsored by the manufacturer of AlloMap (XDx, Page 2 of 7 TRANS.00025 Laboratory Testing as an Aid in the Diagnosis of Heart Transplant Reject i... 10/6/2015 file://dhs.sdc.pvt/HSB/OHPR%20HERC% 20Public/DBIssues/2015/2016%20CPT%20co d...Inc.), was a randomized, event-driven, noninfer iority trial which was conducted at 13 U.S. transplant centers between January 2005 and Octobe r 2009 (with median follow -up of 19 months). This trial included 602 selected transplant recipi ents who had undergone a transplant more than 6 months prior and who were considered at low risk for rejection. The purpose of this study was to compare rejection outcomes be tween those who underwent routine EMB and those who were monitored with the AlloMap gene expression prof iling test. The primary outcome was the first occurrence of rejection with hemodynamic compromise, graft dysfunction due to other causes, death, or retransplantation. Results indicated that a strategy of monitoring for rejection that involved gene-expression profiling, as compared with routine biopsie s, was not associated with an increased risk of serious advers e outcomes and resulted in the pe rformance of significantly fewer biopsies. During the median follow-up period (1 9 months), subjects w ho were monitored with AlloMap and those who underwent routine EMB ha d similar 2 year cumulative rates of the composite primary outcome (14.5% and 15.3%, respectively; hazard ratio with gene-expression profiling, 1.04; 95% confidence in terval, 0.67 to 1.68). The 2 year rates of death from any cause were also similar in the two groups (6.3% and 5. 5%, respectively; p=0.82) . Although the limited power of the study did not allow for firm conclusions regarding the utility of AlloMap as a substitute for EMB, the authors concluded that gene expression profiling of peripheral blood specimens may offer a reasonable alternative to r outine biopsies, for moni toring cardiac transplant rejection, if the interval since transplantation is at least 6 months and the individual is considered to be at low risk for rejection (Pham, 2010). In 2010, the International Society of Heart and L ung Transplantation (ISHLT) issued guidelines for the care of heart transplant recipi ents which included the following: The standard of care for adult heart tran splant recipients is to perform periodic endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) duri ng the first 6-12 months for rejection surveillance; (Class IIa, Level of Evidence: C) After the first year post-transplant, EMB surv eillance every 4-6 months is recommended for patients at higher risk of late acute rejection; (Cla ss IIa, Level of Evidence: C) Gene expression profiling using the AlloMap test can be used to rule out acute heart rejection (grade 2 or greater) in appropriate low-risk patients between 6 months and 5 years post- transplant (Class IIa, Level of Evidence: B). The recommendation for AlloMap is based on th e results of the CARGO and IMAGE trials (Costanzo, 2010). In summary, the current ISHLT recommendations for the use of AlloMap in limited clinical protocols, the results of the IMAGE trial, and i nput from the transplant practice community support the use of AlloMap to assess risk for rejection in clinically stable heart transplant recipients between 1 and 5 years post-transplant. Background/Overview Breath Test Although the current gold standard test for detecting rejection is EMB, this is limited in accuracy, has a high degree of inter-observer va riability, and may yield tissue th at is not representative of the overall pathology. It is also i nvasive and can lead to infecti ons, arrhythmias, or ventricular perforation. Despite these limitations, the breath te st is currently not establ ished as a substitute for EMB. *Note: A Humanitarian Use Device (HUD) is a device that has been given special approval by the FDA under the Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE ) regulations and is utilized in special circumstances where a condition is so rare (fewer than 4000 individuals in the U.S. per year) that testing of large numbers of subjects is not feasible . In these special situations, the FDA may grant an HDE provided that: the device does not pose an unreasonable or significant risk of illness or injury; and the probable benefit to health outweighs th e risk of injury or illness from its use, taking into account the probable risks and benefits of curre ntly available devices or alternative forms of treatment. Additionally, the FDA notes that the applicant must demonstrate that no comparable devices are available to treat or diagnose the diseas e or condition, and that they could not otherwise bring the device to market. The labeling for an HUD must state that the device is a Humanitarian Use Device and that, although the device is author ized by federal law, the effectiveness of the device for the specific indication ha s not been demonstrated. (FDA, 2004) AlloMap Molecular Expression TestingThe California Technology Assessment Forum (C TAF) conducted a technology assessment of gene-expression profiling for the diagnosis of heart transplant rejection in 2006, at which time it Page 3 of 7 TRANS.00025 Laboratory Testing as an Aid in the Diagnosis of Heart Transplant Reject i... 10/6/2015 file://dhs.sdc.pvt/HSB/OHPR%20HERC% 20Public/DBIssues/2015/2016%20CPT%20co d...was determined that the use of gene-expression prof iling did not meet CTAF criteria when used to manage heart transplant patients. The CTAF assessment stated that: Gene expression profiling offers the potentia l for a non-invasive test that may replace endomyocardial biopsy as the gold st andard for transplant rejection. However, given the history of poor reproducibility of other gene expression profiles in the recent past, it is prudent to require independent confirmation of the CARGO study results before wi despread adoption of the AlloMap gene expression profile to monitor h eart transplant patients for early detection of rejection occurs (CTAF, 2006). This initial CTAF determination was based on concerns around the post-hoc change in the threshold used to define a positive test result in the CARGO study and the small size of this primary validation study, in addi tion to the fact that there were no studies, published to date, comparing the clinical outcomes of individuals m onitored with gene expression profiling to those monitored with EMB (CTAF, 2006). In 2010, the CTAF conducted a systematic re-rev iew of available published evidence focusing on results of the AlloMap test which included six observational studies and one randomized trial. Three of the publications included in this review reported on subsets of participants from the CARGO trial, as well as resu lts of the IMAGE trial and conc luded that, \"This technology meets CTAF's assessment criteria for safety, effectiveness and improvement in health outcomes when used to manage heart transplant patients at leas t one year post-transplant.\" The CTAF assessment included the following conclusions: The AlloMap gene expression prof ile has a high negative predicti ve value, but a low positive predictive value. Thus, it may be useful to a void biopsy in stable patients, but the high false positive rate precludes its use to definitively diagnose acute cel lular rejection. Endomyocardial biopsies will still need to be performed in all patients with elevated AlloMap scores and all patients with clinical signs of rejection. The IMAGE trial provides data supporting the non- inferiority of a monitoring strategy for heart tran splant patients incorporating the AlloMap gene expression profile in li eu of routine endomyocardial biopsy. However, the data only support such strategies in patients more than a year post- transplant. More data are needed to confirm the tests utility earlier in the post-transplant peri od when the majority of endomyocardial biopsies are performed (CTAF/Tice, 2010). In 2011, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Associat ion published a Technology Assessment Report of gene expression profiling as a noninvasive method to monitor for cardiac allogr aft rejection. This review and analysis of the available published ev idence concluded that the use of gene expression profiling as a noninvasive method to monitor for ca rdiac allograft rejection does not meet the TEC criteria. The following are some summarized conclusions: Although a higher score is associated with a great er likelihood of rejecti on class 3A or higher, the diagnostic characteristics of AlloMap\u00ae testing are uncertain. Study methods are unclear, study samples are incompletely described, numbers of cases of rejection are apparently small, and cutoff scores appear to have been determ ined post hoc. The sensitivity of the test for detecting rejection is uncertain (TEC, 2011). Definitions Allograft rejection: The recipient's immune system rejects the donor heart. Endomyocardium: The innerm ost lining of the heart. Endomyocardial biopsy: A tissue sample of the endomyocardium. Heart transplant: Removal of a human h eart and replacing it with a donor heart.

This technology is a minimally or non - invasive technique to measure cardiac output, and meant to replace central pulmonary artery catheters. There are several commercial devices which can perform these measurements, such as the PiCCO, Volum eView/EV1000, LiDCOplus, FloTrac/Vigileo, ProAQT/Pulsioflex, and LiDCOrapid. These devices are normally used in the hospital setting and therefore are bundled into the hospital DRG payment. However, there may be some use in the outpatient setting, partic ularly in surgical centers. Evidence 1) Monnet and Teboul 2015 , review a.

Experimental Minimally Invasive Monitoring Xavier Monnet, MD, PhDa,b,*, Jean-Louis Teboul, MD, PhDa,b INTRODUCTION For many years, the measurement of cardiac output in operating rooms and intensive care units could be performed only with the pulmonary artery catheter. The popularity of the pulmonary artery catheter has progressively declined and some alternative tech-niques have been developed during recent years, 1mainly because catheters are inva- sive, cumbersome to set up, and some of the variables it provides can be difficult to measure and interpret appropriately. Among the alternative techniques, arterial pres-sure waveform analysis infers cardiac output from the systemic arterial pressure curve.Some of these arterial pressure waveform analysis devices only need an arterial cath- eter for this purpose and can be considered as minimally invasive. Pulse contour anal- ysis was recently developed for arterial curves that are recorded in a noninvasive way. Conflicts of interest: Professors X. Monnet and J-L.

All rights reserved.This article first summarizes the technological principles of pulse contour analysis. In particular, it explains how devices differ in whether or not they need to be calibrated.The literature on the reliability of arterial pressure waveform analysis for estimating cardiac output is reviewed. In addition, the role of such devices with respect to the other hemodynamic monitoring devices is discussed. PRINCIPLES OF ARTERIAL PRESSURE WAVEFORM ANALYSIS Two types of device that use arterial pressure waveform analysis have beendeveloped. Some of them (PiCCO by Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany;LiDCOplus by LiDCO, London, United Kingdom; and VolumeView/EV1000 by Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) calibrate the pressure waveform analysis with an in- dependent measurement of cardiac output done by transpulmonary dilution. Someother devices (FloTrac/Vigileo Medical do not require any calibration for pressure waveform analysis and are minimallyinvasive because they only require a standard arterial catheter. This article briefly describes the functioning principle of both kinds of pressure waveform analysis device. However, the precise algorithms used by the devices are not disclosed by the manufacturers. Calibrated Devices These devices integrate 2 independent techniques for measuring cardiac output: arte-rial pressure waveform analysis and transpulmonary dilution (with and with lithium for LiDCOplus). PiCCO and VolumeView/EV1000 Principles common to both devices The PiCCO and VolumeView/EV1000 devices use a pressure waveform analysis that is based on the principle that stroke volume is pro- portional to arterial pulse pressure and inversely proportional to arterial compliance. Inthe early 1990s, Wesseling and colleagues 2computed the aortic flow from the sys- temic arterial pressure in humans. They simulated a 3-element model including the characteristic impedance of the aorta, the arterial compliance, and systemic vascular resistance ( Fig. 1 ). They described for the first time that it is possible to monitor car- diac output continuously from pulse contour analysis.2 Based on this principle, all devices estimating cardiac output from pressure wave- form analysis record the arterial pressure curve from a peripheral artery and automat-ically compute cardiac output from it. Overall, for most devices, the analysis is supported by 4 principles: 1. The amplitude of the pressure curve of the aorta is proportional to stroke volume and to a multiplication factor k. 2. k is inversely proportional to the arterial compliance.3. The arterial pressure at the periphery is different from the arterial pressure at the aortic level (see Fig. 1 ). This difference is called the pulse wave amplification phe- nomenon. Because of the reduction of arterial diameter from the aorta to the periph-ery, the amplitude of the arterial pressure signal increases along the arterial tree. 4. The amplification of pulse along the arterial tree depends on the arterial resistance. As a result, arterial pressure waveform analysis devices must: 1. Analyze the geometry of the arterial pressure curve signal 2. Estimate the arterial complianceMonnet & Teboul 26A C DB Fig. 1. Pulse pressure analysis. The flow ejected out of the left ventricle ( A) generates a pres- sure at the aortic level ( C) and at the femoral level ( D). The relationship between flow and the aortic pressure can be represented in a 3-element model ( B), according to Wesseling.2In this model, Z is the characteristic impedance of the aorta, t is time, R is the total arterial resis-tance, and C is the total compliance of the arterial system.Minimally Invasive Monitoring 273. Estimate the aortic pressure from a peripheral arterial pressure 4. Take into account the level of arterial tone PiCCO With this device, pulse contour analysis estimates cardiac output by integrating the area under the systolic part of the arterial curve and dividing it by the aortic compli-ance. 3In addition to the area under the systolic part of the curve, the system takes into account some geometric properties of the pressure curve, such as the time of the dicrotic notch. The arterial compliance is estimated by a proprietary algorithm whencalibration is performed (ie, at each time cardiac output is measured by transpulmo- nary thermodilution). In addition, the algorithm takes into account the systemic vascular resistance, which is continuously tracked by another proprietary algorithm. Resistance is estimated by dividing mean arterial pressure by the value of cardiac output obtained by transpulmonary thermodilution. Calibrating the PiCCO pulse contour analysis by transpulmonary thermodilution is justified because the latter technique provides an estimation of cardiac output that is reliable 4and precise5compared with classic pulmonary thermodilution. Moreover, transpulmonary thermodilution has the advantage of providing many other variablesbesides cardiac output, such as extravascular lung water, 6pulmonary vascular permeability, the cardiac function index (a marker of the cardiac systolic function),7 and the global end-diastolic volume (a marker of cardiac preload).4All these additional variables may be helpful in the decision-making process of hemodynamicresuscitation. Between 2 calibrations, compliance and resistance are constantly reassessed by an algorithm that mainly takes into account the arterial pressure curve and the first deriv-ative of pressure on time according to the compliance, which is calculated from arterial pressure. With this constant reassessment of the arterial compliance, the system tends to adapt its estimation of cardiac output to the modifications of the hemodynamic status between 2 calibrations by transpulmonary thermodilution. Because it requires transpulmonary thermodilution and because transpulmonary a central and a large-diameter femoral arterial catheter, the PiCCO device must be considered more as less invasive than as mini- mally invasive. 8 Another disadvantage of the PiCCO device is that it requires frequent recalibrations. A study found that the estimation of cardiac output by pulse contour analysis became insufficiently reliable if the previous calibration was performed more than 1 hour before.9The drift of pulse contour analysis-derived cardiac output is particularly important if arterial resistance changes to a large extent. In practice, this does not mean that the pulse contour analysis should be systematically recalibrated every hour in every patient, but rather that, in case of hemodynamic instability, calibrationshould be performed if it has not been performed for more than 1 hour. Volumeview/EV1000 The VolumeView/EV1000 device is another transpulmonary thermodilution device that, in many aspects, works like the PiCCO, at least as far ascan be ascertained from the manufacturer. Like the PiCCO, the system uses transpul- monary thermodilution & Teboul 28cardiac output. The estimation of cardiac output is based on the algorithm that is also used by the FloTrac/Vigileo device (discussed later). As with the PiCCO device,because of the arterial catheter required by transpulmonary thermodilution, the Volu- meView/EV1000 is invasive invasive. LiDCOplus calibrates pressure waveform analysis transpulmonary dilu- tion. With this technique, lithium chloride is injected as an intravenous bolus into a central vein, and its concentration in arterial blood is then measured over time by a lithium-sensitive electrode attached to a peripheral arterial catheter. Lithium dilutionhas been shown to be reliable compared with the pulmonary artery catheter 10,11 and to be precise.12 The arterial pressure waveform analysis with the LiDCOplus, which uses the Pul- seCO algorithm, is the same as for the LiDCOrapid device and is detailed later.Note that the use of lithium is not authorized in all countries. Uncalibrated Devices All these devices share the advantage of not requiring calibration by thermodilution.The technique they use for pressure waveform analysis differs slightly between devices. FloTrac/Vigileo With this system, stroke volume is estimated as: SV5K/C2pulsatility where Kis a constant that quantifies arterial resistance and compliance. K is estimated from the morphometric data of the patient and is based on the method described by Langewouters and colleagues13and supported by a large data- base of pressure tracings recorded in hyperdynamic and vasoplegic patients.14The estimation is based on K and the arterial pulsatility. The device provides the startingvalue of K. Then, K is automatically adapted every 60 seconds by taking into account some geometric properties of the arterial pressure curve, such as skewness and kur- tosis. Pulsatility is estimated from the standard deviations of pulse pressure. In practice, the device consists of a standard arterial catheter and a standard arterial line that is connected to a disposable specific pressure transducer (FloTrac). The pres- sure transducer is connected to the Vigileo device, which performs analysis and dis-plays cardiac output. ProAQT/Pulsioflex Like the FloTrac/Vigileo system, the more recent ProAQT/Pulsioflex does not need anyexternal calibration of pressure waveform analysis. Nevertheless, the main distinctionof this device is that the initial value of cardiac output from which the pulse contouranalysis is started is not estimated by pulse contour analysis but by an innovative pro- prietary algorithm that performs an autocalibration. It uses the biometric values (age, height, and weight) as well as mean arterial pressure and heart rate. The cardiacoutput value is inferred from a statistical analysis of these data; this analysis is confi- dential and is not a Windkessel model. After the initial estimation of cardiac output, the ProAQT/Pulsioflex performs pulse contour analysis with a method similar to that of thePiCCO. With the ProAQT/Pulsioflex, an automatic autocalibration of cardiac output can also be done at any time by just clicking a button. This autocalibration is supposed toMinimally Invasive Monitoring 29reduce the drift that may have occurred since the previous estimation. In addition, it is also possible to manually enter a value for cardiac output measured by another tech-nique (eg, echocardiography). The pulse contour analysis then starts from this external calibration value. In practice, the device works with a standard arterial catheter and arterial line, which are connected to a specific disposable pressure transducer (ProAQT), which is con- nected to the monitor (Pulsioflex). LiDCOrapid This device is an evolution of the LiDCOplus that does not require any calibration.Pressure waveform analysis uses the same PulseCO algorithm as the LiDCOplus (described earlier). The PulseCO algorithm is based on the principles of conservationof mass and power and is not based on a Windkessel approach. Stroke volume iscalculated from an analysis of the stroke volume-induced pulsatile change in the pres- sure waveform. In addition, the arterial compliance is inferred from the age, height, and weight of the patient through established nomograms. The system does not need any calibration but, as with the ProAQT/Pulsioflex, it is possible to manually enter a value of cardiac output measured by an independent technique. Pressure recording analytical method The pressure recording analytical method (PRAM) is embedded in the MostCare de-vice. With this method, the arterial pressure waveform analysis is based on the com-plex theory of perturbations. The estimation of cardiac output is grossly based on thearea under the arterial pressure curve, on the analytical description of the arterial pres- sure waveform, and on the instantaneous acceleration of the arterial vessel cross- sectional area. With this technique, the arterial impedance is only estimated by the characteristics of the arterial pressure curve, with no need for any calibration and independently from the morphometric data of the patient. 15 RELIABILITY OF ARTERIAL PRESSURE WAVEFORM ANALYSIS DEVICES The validation of devices providing a pressure-based estimation of cardiac output hasbeen the purpose of several studies. It is difficult to summarize them, because theyhave provided heterogeneous results. Moreover, the technique used as the reference(eg, the pulmonary artery catheter) has its own limitations. An example of this is shown inFig. 2 , which is adapted from a study in which the pulmonary artery catheter showed bias and limits of agreement that were similar to those of some pulse waveform anal-ysis devices (see Fig. 2 ). 16Nevertheless, this article aims to clarify the validation of different devices. Calibrated Devices PiCCO The validation of the pulse contour analysis of the PiCCO device has been performed by some clinical studies comparing it with the pulmonary artery catheter, which wasused as a reference. Overall, these studies show that this reliability is accept- able. 3,9,17-23Note that, as stated earlier, the closer the measurement from a previous calibration, the better the reliability.9 The validation of a device measuring cardiac output should be based not only on its accuracy, which is its ability to provide a value that is close to the true value, but also on its precision, which is the ability to provide values that are close to each other. InMonnet & Teboul 30Fig. 2. Bland-Altman analysis of each device against the mean of all devices across all patients, wherein pulmonary arterial catheter (PAC), thermodilution cardiac output, and continuous cardiac output measured by the PAC are pooled to be 1 variable ( Z-statistic). Solid line, mean difference (bias); dotted line, limits of agreement (bias /C61.96 standard deviation). (From Hadian M, Kim HK, Severyn DA, et al. Cross-comparison of cardiac output trending ac- curacy of LiDCO, PiCCO, FloTrac and pulmonary artery catheters. Crit Care 2010;14:R212.)31this regard, the coefficient of variation of pulse contour analysis with the PiCCO is less than 2%,9which means that, if the patient's condition is stable, even small changes in cardiac output detected by pulse contour analysis should be considered as reliable.24 LiDCOplus Reliability of the LiDCOplus device compared with thermodilution methods has beenreported by concordant studies. 25-27Because of its specific PulseCO algorithm, the estimation of cardiac output by the LiDCOplus is supposed to be less sensitive to changes in the morphology of the arterial curve than pulse contour analysis, especiallyin cases of vasopressor administration. The technique is also supposed to be less sensitive to arterial line damping than other pulse wave analysis techniques. Neverthe- less, these potential advantages have not been shown until now. Volumeview/EV1000 The reliability of pulse contour analysis measured by the more recent VolumeView/ EV1000 has so far been shown by only 1 study,28which also reported a good tracking ability compared with transpulmonary thermodilution. Overall, it is reasonable to consider that the calibrated pulse contour analysis sys- tems are reliable to estimate cardiac output. This reliability is mostly related to the pos- sibility to regularly reset the estimation with transpulmonary dilution, a technique thatitself provides a reliable measurement of cardiac output. These calibrated devices have the disadvantage of requiring injections of cold boluses or lithium. With the PiCCO and VolumeView/EV1000 devices, such injections require a large-diameterarterial catheter, so these techniques cannot be described as minimally invasive. Uncalibrated Devices FloTrac/Vigileo Results concerning the reliability of the uncalibrated devices are not as concordant as for the calibrated devices. The FloTrac/Vigileo, as the precursor of such devices, wasthe most studied. Although some studies reported good reliability, 14,29-34some others found opposite results.35-47 One possible explanation for this discrepancy may concern the setting in which the studies were conducted. Overall, most of the studies showing good reliability of theFloTrac/Vigileo were conducted in perioperative settings, 29-31,33even though poor re- sults were also obtained in such patients.48The poorest results were obtained in crit- ically ill patients40,41,43,47or patients undergoing liver surgery36-39,44-46(ie, in patients with large changes in vasomotor tone). The reliability of the FloTrac/Vigileo seems to decrease if the vasomotor tone changes to a large extent.35,38,41-43Note that the reli- ability of a cardiac output monitoring device depends not only on its ability to provide areliable absolute value of cardiac output but also on its ability to track changes in car- diac output. For instance, Monnet and colleagues 43found that the reliability of the last version of the FloTrac/Vigileo was much poorer in tracking the changes in cardiac output whenthey were induced by changing the dose of norepinephrine than by administering a volume expansion. It was similarly reported that the reliability of the FloTrac/Vigileo was poor during liver transplant surgery and that the poorest results were obtainedwhen the systemic vascular resistance changed to a large extent. 38In some patients before surgical intervention, the FloTrac/Vigileo provided a good estimation of cardiac output compared with esophageal Doppler when preload was increased, whereas itwas poor when the arterial tone was modified by ephedrine or phenylephrine. 42The trending ability of the third version of the FloTrac/Vigileo during phenylephrine admin- istration similarly was the lowest when the systemic vascular resistance was theMonnet & Teboul 32highest.49Overall, the failure of uncalibrated pulse contour analysis may be related mainly to its inability to take into account changes in vascular tone. All situations in which the arterial pressure waveform is abnormally modified are also at risk for unreliability of uncalibrated pulse contour analysis. This unreliability can arise in cases of dampening of the arterial pressure curve, which justifies careful checking ofthe arterial line when such devices are used. This unreliability can be related to air bub- bles, blood clots in the arterial catheter, line. Aortic regurgitation 35and stenosis50are other conditions in which pulse contour analysis by the FloTrac/Vigileo has been shown to have poor reliability, even though it could still reliably track the changes in cardiac output.50Such uncali- brated devices produced conflicting results with intra-aortic balloon pumps, somewith acceptable 51and others with unacceptable biases and limits of agreement.35 The reliability of the uncalibrated devices may also depend on the arterial site to which they are connected. Nevertheless, some results showed no41,52or minimal53 differences between cardiac output values obtained from the femoral and the radial sites. LiDCOrapid The LiDCOrapid device has had less evaluation. In patients undergoing cardiac sur-gery, the estimation of cardiac output by pulse power analysis was influenced by the mean arterial pressure, yielding an unacceptable bias. 54A high percentage error was also recently reported for this device compared with esophageal Doppler moni-toring, associated with a bad trending ability. 55 ProAQT/Pulsioflex The recent ProAQT/Pulsioflex device still requires validation studies. In particular, these studies should investigate whether the autocalibration allowed by the ProAQT/Pulsioflex improves the measurement of cardiac output. Pressure recording analytical method The PRAM algorithm of the MostCare device has been investigated by only a fewstudies. In patients after cardiac surgery and with an intra-aortic balloon pump, thisuncalibrated estimation of cardiac output was acceptable. 15In septic patients receiving norepinephrine, and compared with the pulmonary artery catheter, the PRAM system showed an acceptable percentage of error.56This finding was also shown in cardiac surgical patients; even in those with an intra-aortic balloonpump 51,57,58(ie, patients in whom pulse waveform analysis is usually considered inop- erative). In contrast with these positive results, another study from a different group found a profound lack of agreement between PRAM and the pulmonary artery cath-eter, without any obvious explanation for this discrepancy. 59 THE ADVANTAGE OF A REAL-TIME MONITORING OF CARDIAC OUTPUT WITH ARTERIAL PRESSURE WAVEFORM ANALYSIS The most important advantage of the arterial pressure waveform contour analysis technique is that it provides a real-time measurement of cardiac output because it is based on a measurement of stroke volume from beat to beat. This real-time mea- surement is useful in 2 ways. Stroke Volume Variation All the arterial pressure waveform analysis devices measure the percentage of varia-tion of stroke volume over time. This variation within the respiratory cycle is associatedMinimally Invasive Monitoring 33with preload reserve, based on the same principle as pulse pressure variation.60Even though stroke volume and pulse pressure variations are not exactly the same,61,62 stroke volume variation has regularly been shown to predict fluid responsiveness as reliably as pulse pressure variation.63-80 Note that stroke volume variation has the same limitations as pulse pressure varia- tion.81It cannot be used to predict fluid responsiveness in cases of spontaneous breathing activity, cardiac arrhythmias, low tidal volume and low lung compliance,82 and open chest conditions. Short-term Changes in Cardiac Output Arterial pressure waveform analysis is particularly suitable for assessing changes in cardiac output occurring on a very short time scale. Note that this is not the case for the semicontinuous thermodilution by the pulmonary artery catheter, which reflects only the changes in cardiac output that occurred during the last few minutes. For instance, arterial pressure waveform analysis is particularly suitable for assess- ing the effects of the passive leg raising test24,63,64,82-84or of the end-expiratory occlu- sion test,24,82,85which exert their hemodynamic effects on periods of time that are too short to use a dilution method. CONTEXT OF USE OF ARTERIAL PRESSURE WAVEFORM ANALYSIS DEVICES Uncalibrated Devices The typical indication for the uncalibrated pulse contour analysis devices is the moni- toring of surgical interventions in high-risk surgical patients. First, as detailed earlier, it is in this context that the reliability of cardiac output measurement by such devices hasbeen found to be the best. The low invasiveness of the uncalibrated devices is partic- ularly appropriate for these patients with a low risk of complications during surgery. The poor results obtained during liver surgery 36-39,44-46suggest that the uncali- brated devices should not be used during this type of surgery, which is associated with large changes in vascular tone. Also, during cardiac surgery, hemodynamic eval- uation by uncalibrated pulse contour analysis devices is likely to be too limited. Inaddition, the measurement of cardiac output, along with stroke volume variation, fits the requirement of hemodynamic monitoring during surgery, which is to alert the anesthesiologist of a hemodynamic impairment. 86 In surgery for high-risk patients, hemodynamic monitoring by uncalibrated devices attached to a therapeutic protocol has been found to decrease the risk of complica- tions, either with the PiCCO87or the Vigileo.88,89This finding reinforces the message that a preemptive hemodynamic intervention improves the postoperative outcome ofsuch patients. 90 Calibrated Devices These devices are likely more indicated in critically ill patients. In these patients, who often receive vasopressors and in whom the vasomotor tone is unstable, external cali- bration reduces the errors in cardiac output measurement by pulse contour analysisrelated to changes in vasomotor tone. The invasiveness of such devices is more acceptable in critically ill patients than in surgical patients because of the greater severity of their illnesses, even though the rate complications related to the calibratedpulse contour analysis devices is low. 8In addition, in this context the intensivist may be interested in the other hemodynamic variables that pulmonary thermodilution pro- vides besides pulse PRESSURE CURVE The Nexfin device (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) provides a noninvasive estima- tion of the arterial pressure curve and uses it to compute cardiac output. Tracing of the Noninvasive Arterial Curve The Nexfin device allows a continuous estimation of the arterial pressure curve through the volume-clamp method.92For this purpose, the device includes an inflat- able cuff that is wrapped around a finger. It also includes a photoplethysmographic device that measures the diameter of the finger arteries. At each systole, the photople-thysmographic device senses the increase of the finger arteries' diameters. A fast servo-controlled system immediately inflates the cuff in order to keep the arteries' diameters constant. Therefore, cuff pressure reflects the arterial pressure. Its contin-uous measurement allows estimation of the arterial pressure curve. This measurement of arterial pressure by Nexfin has been largely validated for measuring arterial pressure. 93-100 Estimation of Cardiac Output To estimate cardiac output, the device uses a pulse contour waveform analysis. With this device, aortic impedance is determined from a 3-element Windkessel model that incorporates the influence of nonlinear effects of arterial pressure and of the patient'sage, height, weight, and gender on aortic mechanical properties. 101The Nexfin method was developed on a database including invasive and noninvasive arterial pressures together with thermodilution cardiac output values. The reliability of this estimation of cardiac output has provided discrepant results, with both positive94,102-108and negative studies.100,109,110 The most plausible hypothesis explaining this discrepancy is the difference in the population of interest. The studies that showed a better reliability of the Nexfin wereconducted in the operating theater, 102,103in patients having cardiac surgery after discontinuation of mechanical ventilation and inotropes,94in patients undergoing resynchronization therapy,105in an echocardiography laboratory,104or in healthy jects.107By contrast, the studies reporting unreliability of the technique100,109included critically ill patients, most with septic shock. In such patients, poor finger perfusion likely impedes the correct assessment of the finger pressure curve by the volume-clamp method, which includes an analysis of the finger photoplethysmographic signal.This limitation suggests that such a device is more suitable for the operating theater than for intensive care units. SUMMARY The number of less invasive devices monitoring cardiac output using a pressure- based estimation of cardiac output has increased during recent years. The low inva-siveness of such systems, which is a particular advantage in operating theaters, seems to be counterbalanced by a reliability that is lower than for more invasive de- vices. This lower reliability applies particularly in comparisons of calibrated and uncal-ibrated pulse contour analyzing devices. Technological improvement in these recently developed devices may reduce this limitation of less invasive devices. REFERENCES 1.Richard C, Monnet X, Teboul JL.

Evaluation of cardiac output in intensive care using a non-invasive arterial pulse contour technique (eg, automated -fractions), bilateral; with onsite analysis Issue : Photoscreening is a method to screen for vision issues in young or non -verbal/non - cooperative children. The USPSTF (2011) recommends vision screening for all children at least once between the ages of 3 and 5 years, to detect the presence of amblyopia or its risk fa ctors (grade B recommendation). The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of vision screening for children <3 years of age (I statement). Similar code 99174 ( Instrument -based ocular screening (eg, photoscreening, automated - refraction), bilateral ) is currently on the Services Recommended for Non -Coverage Table. From the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus : Photoscreening is a form of pediatric vision screening that uses a special -purpose camera to determine how well a child can see. It is an alternative to visual acuity -based screening with an eye chart. By detecting special light reflexes from each eye the devices produ ce images that can help identify refractive errors (like a prescription for glasses) and ocular misalignments (strabismus). When present, these conditions place a child at risk for amblyopia (lazy eye). The camera images can be interpreted by a trained test administrator or by software incorporated into the equipment. If the images show a condition that may lead to amblyopia , a referral should be made by the person performing the photoscreening to a pediatric ophthalmologist for further evaluation. Photoscr eening is particularly useful with pre -verbal children (under age 3 yrs), young children (age 3 -5 yrs) and older, non -cooperative or non -verbal children. As such, photoscreening offers an alternative to traditional visual acuity screening, providing earlie r detection of potential vision problems than has been possible with traditional testing. However, photoscreening cannot determine exactly how well a child's visual acuity is developing. Visual acuity screening thus remains an important component of a child's preventive health care and should still be done when a child is sufficiently mature to respond to this testing (usually age 4 -6 years). Evidence 1) Chou 2011 , review for USPSTF http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/127/2/e442.full.pdf (Not included in packet due to length) a. Results : Direct evidence on the effectiveness of preschool vision screening for improving visual acuity or other clinical outcomes remains limited and does not adequately address whether screening is more effective than no screening. Regarding indirect evidence, a number of screening tests have utility for identification of preschool -aged children with vision problems. Photoscreening 2 i. In 8 s tudies of the Medical Technology and Innovations (MTI) photoscreener, the median positive likelihood ratio (PLR) was 6.2 (range: 2.4- 8.7) and the median negative likelihood ratio (NLR) was 0.26 (range: 0.06 -0.67). ii. From 2 studies of the iScreen photoscree ner, a median PLR of 7.3 (range: and median NLR of 0.25 (range: 0.09 -0.67) were reported. iii. Two studies of the Visiscreen 100 photoscreener resulted in a median PLR of 7.0 (range: 3.5 -14) and median NLR of 0.14 (range: 0.12 - 0.16). b. Conclusions: Although treatments for amblyopia or unilateral refractive error can improve vision in preschool -aged children and screening tests have utility for identifying vision problems, additional studies are needed to better understand the effects of screening compa red with no screening. 2) AHRQ 2004 , systematic review http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/prevent/pdfser/visualser.pdf (Not included due to length) a.

Photoscreening and handheld autoref raction may be electively performed in children 6 months to 3 years of age, allowing earlier detection of conditions that may lead to amblyopia, as well as in older children who are unable or unwilling to cooperate with routine acuity screening. b. Photoscree ning and handheld autorefraction are recommended as an alternative to visual acuity screening with vision charts from 3 through 5 years of age, after which visual acuity screening with vision charts becomes more ef ficient and less costly in the medical home. Adequate payment for instrument based vision - screening services must be ensured if there is to be widespread adoption of this recommendation. c. Alternatively, the use of vision charts and standard physical examination techniques to assess amblyopia in children 3 to 5 years of age in the medical home remains a viable practice at the present time. d. There is no recommendation for mass screening at this time. e. Regardless of the type of photoscreening system used, the evaluator must know how to properly apply the technology and understand the limitations of the test, such as the possible occurrence of false -positive and false -negative results as they apply to the population being tested. f.

Summary: Early vision screening is recommended by major evidence based organizations; however, clinical exam and standard eye chart testing appears to be sufficient.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: The 2004 USPSTF recommendation statement is updated here. abstract OBJECTIVE: The goal was to provide an update of the 2004 US Preven- tive Services Task Force (USPSTF) statement about screening for visualimpairment in children /H110215 years of age. METHODS: The USPSTF examined evidence on the association of screening for visual impairment in children 1 to 5 years of age withimproved health outcomes, the accuracy of risk factor assessment andscreening tests, the effectiveness of early detection and treatment, andthe harms of screening and treatment. RECOMMENDATION: The USPSTF recommends vision screening for all children at least once between the ages of 3 and 5 years, to detect thepresence of amblyopia or its risk factors (grade B recommendation).The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufcient to as-sess the balance of benets and harms of vision screening for children/H110213 years of age (I statement).

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufcient to assess thebalance of benets and harms ofvision screening for children /H110213 years of age. This statement is an Istatement. See Figure 1 for a summary of the rec- ommendations and suggestions forclinical practice, Table 1 for a descrip-tion of the USPSTF grades, and Table 2 for a description of the USPSTF classi-cation of levels of certainty about net benet. RATIONALE Importance Approximately 2% to 4% of preschool- aged children have amblyopia, an al-teration in the visual neural pathway inthe developing brain that can lead topermanent vision loss in the affectedeye. Amblyopia usually occurs unilat-erally but can occur bilaterally. Identi-cation of vision impairment beforeschool entry could help identify chil-dren who may benet from early interventions to correct or to improvevision. Detection The USPSTF found adequate evidence that vision screening tools have rea-sonable accuracy in detecting visualimpairment, including refractive er-rors, strabismus, and amblyopia. Benets of Detection and Early Intervention The USPSTF found adequate evidence that early treatment for amblyopia, in-cluding the use of cycloplegic agents,patching, and eyeglasses, for children FIGURE 1 Clinical summary of USPSTF recommendation for vision screening in children 1 to 5 years of age.

The USPSTF found in-adequate evidence that early treat-ment of amblyopia for children /H110213 years of age leads to improved visualoutcomes.Harms of Detection and Early Intervention The USPSTF found limited evidence regarding harms of screening, in-cluding psychosocial effects, for chil-dren/H113503 years of age. False-positivescreening results may lead to the overprescribing of corrective lenses.Adequate evidence suggests that theharms of treatment of amblyopia forchildren /H113503 years of age are limited to reversible loss of visual acuity re-sulting from patching of the nonaf-fected eye. The USPSTF found inade-quate evidence of the harms ofscreening and treatment for chil-dren/H110213 years of age. USPSTF Assessment The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that vision screening for chil-dren 3 to 5 years of age has a moder-ate net benet. The USPSTF concludesthat the benets of vision screeningfor children /H110213 years of age are un- certain and that the balance of bene-ts and harms cannot be determinedfor this age group. CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS Patient Population UnderConsideration This recommendation applies to all children 1 to 5 years of age. Screening Tests Various screening tests that are feasi- ble in primary care are used to identifyvisual impairment among children.These tests include visual acuity tests,stereoacuity tests, cover-uncovertest, and the Hirschberg light reflextest (for ocular alignment/strabis-mus), as well as the use of autorefrac-tors (automated optical instrumentsthat detect refractive errors) and pho-toscreeners (instruments that detectamblyogenic risk factors and refrac-tive errors). Treatment Primary treatment for amblyopia includes the use of corrective lenses,patching, or atropine treatment ofthe nonaffected eye.

There is moderate or highcertainty that the net benet is small.Offer/provide this service only if there are other considerations insupport of offering/providing theservice for an individual patient. D The USPSTF recommends against the service. There is moderate or highcertainty that the service has no netbenet or that the harms outweigh thebenets.Discourage use of this service. I The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufcient to assess thebalance of benets and harms of theservice. Evidence is lacking, of poorquality, or conflicting, and the balanceof benets and harms cannot bedetermined.See the clinical considerations in the USPSTF recommendationstatement. If the service is offered,patients should understand theuncertainty about the balance ofbenets and harms. TABLE 2 USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benet Level of CertaintyDescription High The available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies with representative primary care populations. These studies assess the effects ofthe preventive service on health outcomes. This conclusion is unlikely to be stronglyaffected by the results of future studies. Moderate The available evidence is sufcient to determine the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes, but condence in the estimate is constrained by factors such as (1) thenumber, size, or quality of individual studies; (2) inconsistency of ndings across individualstudies; (3) limited generalizability of ndings to routine primary care practice; or (4) lackof coherence in the chain of evidence. As more information becomes available, themagnitude or direction of the observed effect might change, and this change might belarge enough to alter the conclusion. Low The available evidence is insufcient to assess the effects on health outcomes. Evidence is insufcient because of (1) limited number or size of studies; (2) important flaws in thestudy design or methods; (3) inconsistency of ndings across individual studies; (4) gapsin the chain of evidence; (4) lack of generalizability of ndings to routine primary carepractice; or (5) lack of information on important health outcomes. More information mayallow estimation of effects on health outcomes. The USPSTF denes certainty as the \"likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benet of a preventive service is correct.\" The net benet is dened as benets minus harms of the preventive service, as implemented for a general, primarycare population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level on the basis of the nature of the overall evidence available forassessment of the net benet of a preventive service. 342 US Preventive Services Task Forcemay consist of a combination of interventions. Suggestions for Practice Regarding I Statement In deciding whether to refer children /H110213 years of age for screening, clini- cians should consider the following. Potential Preventable Burden Most studies show that screening and treatment later in the preschool yearsseem to be as effective at preventingamblyopia as screening and treatmentearlier in life. Costs Potential disadvantages of using photoscreeners and autorefractorsare the initial high costs associatedwith the instruments and the needfor external interpretation of screen-ing results with some photoscreeners. Current Practice Typical components of vision screen- ing include assessments of visualacuity, strabismus, and stereoacuity.Younger children often are unableto cooperate with some of thescreening tests performed in clinicalpractice, such as visual acuity test-ing. Steroacuity testing often is omit- ted and may be performed incor-rectly when attempted. Screening ofyounger children may be difcultand often yields false-positive re-sults because of the child's inabilityto cooperate with testing. Childrenwith positive ndings should bereferred for a full ophthalmologicexamination, to conrm the pres-ence of vision problems, and furthertreatment. Screening Intervals The USPSTF did not nd adequate evidence to determine the optimalscreening interval.OTHER CONSIDERATIONS Research Needs and Gaps Several gaps in the evidence were identied. All treatment trials in the lit-erature review enrolled children /H113503 years of age. Well-designed studies areneeded to identify the optimal age forinitiation of methods, and Longitudinal studies thatlink optimal screening tests to theidentication of children with visualimpairments are needed. Additionalstudies are needed to determinethe most-favorable combinations ofscreening tests, as well as the optimaltreatment for amblyopia and the opti-mal treatment duration. There also is aneed for studies that examine the long-term benets and harms of preschoolvision screening, such as quality of life,school performance, and labeling oranxiety. DISCUSSION Burden of Disease The most common causes of vision im- pairment in children are amblyopiaand associated is a disorder characterizedby abnormal processing of visual im-ages by the brain during a critical pe-riod of vision development, which re-sults in a permanent reduction invisual acuity. It is associated with con-ditions that interfere with normal bin-ocular vision, such as strabismus (oc-ular misalignment), anisometropia (a large impairments. Amblyo-pia is regarded disease of child-hood; however, its effects are irre- versible if left untreated, and it is themost common cause of monocularvision loss among adults 20 to 70years of age. An important risk ofamblyopia is that an unrelated, se-vere vision impairment or blindnessmight occur in the nonaffected eye,resulting in severe vision loss oreven legal blindness. Scope of Review The review on which this recommen- dation is based examined evidenceregarding the following topics: theassociation of screening for visualimpairment among children 1 to 5years of age with improved healthoutcomes, the accuracy of risk fac-tor assessment, the accuracy ofscreening tests, the effectiveness ofearly detection, the effectivenessof treatment, and the harms ofscreening and treatment. Accuracy of Screening Tests No studies evaluated the accuracy or reliability of risk factor assessment inpreschool vision screening. There alsowas no evidence on the outcomes oftargeted versus universal preschoolvision screening. Twenty-six studies, including 3 of poor quality and 23 of fair quality, evaluated TABLE 3 Risk Factors for Amblyopia Condition Description Amblyopia Functional reduction in visual acuity characterized by abnormal processing of visual images, which is established by the brain during a critical period of visiondevelopment Strabismus Ocular misalignment; most common cause of amblyopiaAnisometropia Asymmetric refractive error between the 2 eyes, which causes image suppression in the eye with the larger error.

Cyclo-plegic refraction testing was includedin the reference standard examinationin 21 studies. Vision screening tests in-cluded tests of visual acuity, stereoa-cuity, and ocular alignment, as well astests using autorefractors and photo-screeners. The largest study compar-ing screening tests was the Vision inPreschoolers study, 3,4which com- pared 10 different screening tests. Inthe Vision in Preschoolers study, theRandom Dot E stereoacuity test(StereoOptical Co, Chicago, IL), theRandot Stereo Smile Test II (Stereo-Optical Co, Chicago, IL), and the iScreen(iScreen, Inc, Memphis, TN) and Medi-cal Technologies, Inc photoscreeners(Riviera Beach, FL) were associatedwith lower sensitivity (at a similarspecicity), compared with the Leasymbols test (Precision Vision, Inc, La-Salle, IL), the HOTV visual acuity test(Precision Vision, Inc, Power Germany) autorefractors;however, differences in likelihood ra-tio estimates were relatively small. Thecover-uncover test was associatedwith lower sensitivity and higher spec-icity, compared with the other tests.The available studies on vision screen-ing that evaluated various tests in var-ious combinations found that combi-nations of tests were generallyassociated with greater diagnostic ac-curacy, compared with single tests ofvisual acuity, stereoacuity, or ocularalignment, although there is insuf-cient evidence to recommend a spe-cic combination of tests. 1 Vision screening requires a coopera- tive child, and this factor is influencedby the age of the child. Nine fair-qualitystudies evaluated screening tests for vision impairment in stratied agegroups. 1Most of the evidence was lim- ited and inconsistent. Four studiesfound no denitive differences because testability gener-ally exceeded 80% to 90% for children3 years of age, with small increasesthrough 5 years of age. Four studiesfound that testability rates were lowerfor most screening tests (Random DotE test, Lea symbols test, and SureSightautorefractor [Welch Allyn, Inc, Ska-neateles Falls, NY]) for children 1 to 3years of age, compared with children 3to 5 years of age. One large, statewidescreening study of the Medical Tech-nologies photoscreener found 94%testability by 1 year of age. 1 Effectiveness of Early Detectionand Treatment There were no randomized con- trolled trials that compared pre-school vision screening with noscreening. All studies evaluated re- ported on vision outcomes for chil-dren/H113503 years of age. There were no studies available that evaluatedschool performance or other func-tional outcomes in screened versusunscreened populations. One fair-quality, nested, randomized trial found that periodic screeningfrom the ages of 8 months to 37months was associated with a 1% de-crease in the prevalence of amblyopiaat age 7.5 years, compared with one-time screening at 37 months of age. 5 However, the difference was statisti-cally signicant for only 1 denition ofamblyopia. A limitation of the studywas that it was not possible to sepa-rate effects of earlier screening fromthose of repeated screening. Three fair- or good-quality trials with older preschool-aged children (3-5years of age) with am-blyopia or unilateral errors(with or without amblyopia) reportedthat treatment (patching and/or eye- glasses) resulted in a statistically sig-nicant but small ( /H110211 line on the Snellen eye chart) average improve-ment in visual acuity in the affectedeye, compared with no treatment, af-ter follow-up periods of 5 weeks to 1year. 6-8Benets were greater for chil- dren with more-severe visual impair-ment at baseline. One trial found that,in a subgroup of children with more-severe visual impairment at baseline,patching was associated with visualacuity improvement of 1 to 2 lines onthe Snellen eye chart, compared withno treatment. 6Five fair- or good- quality trials found no differences invisual acuity improvement in the af-fected eye between shorter and longerdaily patching regimens, 9,10among different atropine treatment regi-mens, 11,12or between patching and at- ropine treatment.13 Potential Harms of Screening andTreatment Potential harms of preschool vision screening include psychosocial effectssuch as labeling and anxiety, unneces-sary referrals because of false-positive screening results, and unnec-essary use of corrective lenses ortreatments to prevent amblyopia,which can have potential effects onlong-term vision or function. TheUSPSTF found limited evidence re-garding the harms of vision screen-ing for children /H110215 years of age. However, the data that are availablesuggest that harms do exist. Six of 7studies reported false-positive ratesof/H1102270% in low-prevalence popula- tions. state- wide, preschool photoscreening pro-gram found that 20% of children whodid not meet criteria for amblyo-genic risk factors were prescribedeyeglasses; however, there is no evi-dence available on the long-term ef-fects of unnecessary correctivelenses or treatment for amblyopia. 14 344 US Preventive Services Task ForceFive fair-quality trials with children /H113503 years of age demonstrated that some amblyopia treatments are as-sociated with an increased risk of re-versible, short-term loss of visualacuity in the nonaffected eye. 1Al- 1 short-term (5-week) trialfound no increased of visualacuity loss in the nonaffected eye as- sociated with patching versus nopatching, another trial found thatpatching of the nonaffected eye wasassociated with an increased risk ofvisual acuity loss of /H113502 lines on the Snellen eye chart, compared with at-ropine treatment (9% vs 1.4%; P/H11021 .001). One trial found that atropinetreatment plus a plano lens was as-sociated with an increased risk of vi-sual acuity loss of /H113501 line, compared with atropine treatment alone (17%vs 4%; P/H11005.005). In both trials that found decits, visual acuity in thenonaffected eye returned to baselinelevels for most children. Two othertrials found no difference in the riskof visual acuity loss in the nonaf-fected eye in direct comparisons ofdifferent patching or atropine treat-ment regimens. 1 Evidence on adverse psychosocial ef-fects of lim-ited. Two randomized adverse psychosocial ef-fects and found that children weremore likely to be upset about patchingand eyeglasses, compared with eye-glasses alone, and that patching wasassociated with worse emotional well-being than atropine treatment. 1In a co- hort study, screening and treatmentdid not increase the incidence of bully-ing but unexpectedly decreased theodds of bullying by /H1101150% for children offered screening, compared withthose not offered screening, perhapsbecause the screened children com-pleted patching regimens at an earlierage. 2Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benet The USPSTF found adequate evidence that treatment for amblyopia or unilat-eral refractive errors is associated withmoderate improvements in visual acuityfor children 3 to 5 years of age and, intheory, permanent improvementsthroughout life. Although the average im-provement in visual acuity resultingfrom treatment for amblyopia was /H110111 line on a Snellen eye chart, the USPSTFconcluded that the benets are moder-ate because untreated amblyopia re-sults permanent, uncorrectable and potential benets are expe-rienced over the individual's life span.Harms from treatment seem to be mini-mal. Therefore, the USPSTF concludedwith moderate certainty that the overallnet benet is moderate. How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding? Amblyopia is a functional reduction in visual acuity characterized by abnor-mal processing of visual images by thebrain. The loss in visual acuity is notimmediately reversible with simple re-fractive correction, and it is unlikely toresolve spontaneously if left un- treated. Amblyopia typically becomesirreversible if the child is not treatedby 6 to 10 years of age. Therefore, pre-school screening seems to be consis-tent with the current biological under-standing of amblyopia and theimportance of detecting it during acritical period in development. Response to Public Comments A draft version of this rec ommenda- tion statement was posted for publiccomment on the USPSTF Web sitefrom October 5 through October 23,2009. A small number of commentswere received from individuals or or-ganizations. All comments were re-viewed in the creation of this nalrecommendation.UPDATE OF PREVIOUS USPSTF RECOMMENDATION This recommendation updates the 2004 recommendation, in which theUSPSTF recommended vision screen-ing for all children /H110215 years of age. 15 The USPSTF now recommends vision screening for the presence of amblyo-pia and its risk factors for all children3 to 5 years of age (B recommenda-tion). For children /H110213 years of age, the USPSTF concludes that the current ev-idence is insufcient to assess the bal-ance of benets and harms of visionscreening (I statement). RECOMMENDATIONS OF OTHERS Preschool vision screening is recom-mended by several other organiza-tions; however, the specic age for ini-tiation of screening and the particularscreening tests that are recom-mended vary. The American Academyof Family Physicians is updating itsrecommendation, which is similar tothat of the USPSTF. 16The American Academy of Pediatrics recommendsscreening for distance visual acuity,ocular alignment, and ocular mediaclarity for children 3 to 6 years of ageand older. 17The American Academy of Ophthalmology and the American As-sociation for Pediatric Ophthalmologyand recommends a comprehen-sive eye examination at 3 years ofage. 19 MEMBERS OF THE USPSTF Members of the USPSTF at the time thisrecommendation was voted on wereas follows: Ned Calonge, MD, MPH,chair MPH, vice-chair (Ari-zona State University, AZ); Su-san Curry, PhD (University of Iowa,Iowa City, IA); Thomas G.

This statement asserts that all children should be screened for risk factors associated with am-blyopia. Guidelines are suggested for the use of photo-screening as a technique for the detection of amblyopiaand strabismus in children of various age groups. TheAmerican Academy of Pediatrics favors additional re-search of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of photo-screening as a vision screening tool. ABBREVIATION. AAP, American Academy of Pediatrics. INTRODUCTION The goal of all vision screening is to detect poor vision or risk factors that interfere with vision and normal visual development. It is accepted that early diagnosis and treatment yield better visualoutcomes. The prevalence of amblyopia is estimatedto be 1% to 4% in children 1; however, only 21% of preschool-aged children and even fewer youngerchildren are screened for this condition. 2,3In the policy statement \"Eye Examination and VisionScreening in Infants, Children, and Young Adults,\" theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendsthat all newborns and children be screened for suchrisk factors regularly. 4The components of the vision screening vary by age. Despite the availability of manyscreening options, many children permanently lose vi-sion each year as a result of amblyopia, media opaci-ties, and treatable ocular disease processes. VISION SCREENING Performing vision screening in the pediatric pop- ulation involves many difficulties. Infants and youngpreverbal children are unable to provide subjectiveresponses to visual acuity testing and do not easilycooperate with testing of ocular alignment or ste-reoacuity. It also is difficult to screen certain olderchildren, such as those who are nonverbal or havedevelopmental delays. Targeted populations, partic-ularly those in medically underserved areas, may bedifficult to reach. Screening approaches must be sim-ple and generally successful to enhance the likeli-hood of their use. Other challenges involved with vision screening include false-positive and false-negative resultscaused by low sensitivity and specificity of certaintests. Evaluators may vary in their ability to admin-ister and interpret test results. Regardless of the sys-tem or approach used, it is unacceptable to fail toidentify children at risk of preventable vision loss ortreatable visual disability because of failure to screenor because of false-negative test results. PHOTOSCREENING Photoscreening is a vision screening technique used to screen for amblyogenic factors, such as stra-bismus, media opacities, and significant refractiveerrors, in 1 or both eyes in children. 5,6Photoscreen - ing has the potential to increase the currently lowscreening rates. Using a camera or video systemappropriately equipped for photoscreening, imagesof the pupillary reflexes (reflections) and red reflexes(Bru \u00a8 ckner test) are obtained. 7Other than having to fixate on the appropriate target long enough for thephotoscreening, little cooperation is needed from thechild. Data are then analyzed by the evaluator, re-viewing center, or computer for amblyogenic factors,and positive findings are noted. Children who do notpass the test may be referred for a complete eyeexamination. As a technique to screen for amblyogenic risk fac- tors, photoscreening appears to offer certain conve-niences and advantages over traditional methods ofvision screening, especially in its availability toscreen children who are the most difficult to screenbut in whom the prevalence of amblyopia is higherthan in the general pediatric population. This in-cludes children at high risk for eye problems, such aspremature infants or children with developmentaldelays or a family history of eye problems. Photoscreening does not represent a single tech- nique or piece of equipment. Different optical sys-tems can be used for photoscreening. Interpretationof screened images may be performed onsite or off-site in a reading center or with an automated system. Each photoscreening system may have its own advantages and disadvantages, and it appears thatresults published in the literature for one system arenot necessarily valid for others. Studies performedby different investigators using the same photo-screening apparatus may yield a wide range of re-sults in sensitivity, specificity, and predictive valueswhen onsite interpretation is required. 8-15Likewise, it is not certain that data gathered about differentgroups of children or different settings can be extrap-olated to other groups or settings. In general, it is difficult to compare efficacies of various vision screening methods, such as stereoacu-ity testing, autorefraction, red reflex testing, andcover testing, and then determine if photoscreeninghas better positive and negative predictive values. The recommendations in this statement do not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard of medical care. Variations, taking intoaccount individual circumstances, may be appropriate.PEDIATRICS (ISSN 0031 4005). Copyright \u00a9 2002 by the American Acad-emy of Pediatrics. 524 PEDIATRICS Vol. 109 No. 3 March 2002 by guest on October 14, 2015 pediatrics.aappublications.org Downloaded from This is attributable in part to lack of uniformity in pass-fail criteria for significant refractive errors. More research is needed to establish how photo- screening can be best used. Photoscreening offershope in improving vision screening rates in infants,preverbal children, and those with developmentaldelays who are the most difficult to screen. Photo-screening has not been shown to be superior to othervision screening tests currently used to screen 4- to5-year-olds. In older children, currently available vi-sion screening techniques can be used reliably. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Vision screening should be performed at the ear- liest possible age and at regular intervals duringchildhood as recommended by the AAP. The goalremains to eliminate preventable blindness andtreatable visual disability. 2. Photoscreening is an innovative tool that can fa- cilitate vision screening in children, especially inchildren who are difficult to screen (ie, infants, tod-dlers, and children with developmental delays).Photoscreening systems are one option to increasethe screening rate in preschool-aged children. 3. Regardless of the type of photoscreening system used, the evaluator must know how to properlyapply the technology and understand the limita-tions of the test, such as the possible occurrence offalse-positive and false-negative results as theyapply to the population being tested. 4. Photoscreening needs to be studied more exten- sively. The AAP favors additional research of pho-toscreening devices and other vision screeningmethods in large, controlled studies to elucidate va-lidity of results, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness foridentifying amblyogenic factors in different agegroups as well as subgroups of children. The goalremains to eliminate preventable childhood blind-ness and treatable visual disability. Committee on Practice and Ambulatory Medicine, 2001-2002 Jack T. Swanson, MD, Chairperson F.

As part of this memo, CMS required a shared decision making visit, which must be documented in the patient chart. The new HCPCS code is meant to allow reim bursement for such a visit. This visit is only required prior to the first CT scan; subsequent scans can be ordered during routine visits.

The scope of our review is limited to the consideration of screening for lung cancer with LDCT. Diagnostic CTs are outside the scope of this national coverage analysis. Lung cancer (LC) is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. It is an important issue for the Medicare population due to the age at diagnosis and at death. In 2013, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) estimated that the number of new cases is over 220,000, with a median age at diagnosis of 70 years. Cancer of the lung and bronchus accounted for over 150,000 deaths in 2013 (more than the total number of deaths from colon, breast and prostate cancer combined) with a median age at death of 72 years. Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 9 of 97 Overall mortality rates for lung and bronchus cancer have decreased only slightly over the past decade. The majority of cases are still diagnosed at a late stage with a low five-year relative survival. (NIH/NCI/SEER 2013). The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Cancer Institute (NCI) describes computed tomography (CT) as \"an imaging procedure that uses special x-ray equipment to create detailed pictures, or scans, of areas inside the body. It is also called computerized tomography and computerized axial tomography (CAT). Most modern CT machines take continuous pictures in a helical (or spiral) fashion rather than taking a series of pictures of individual slices of the body, as the original CT machines did. Helical CT has several advantages over older CT techniques: it is faster, produces better 3-D pictures of areas inside the body, and may detect small abnormalities better. The newest CT scanners, called multislice CT or multidetector CT scanners, allow more slices to be imaged in a shorter period of time.\" (NIH/NCI; http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Detection/CT) The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) describes the mechanisms of a CT scanner as follows (also see image below): \"A motorized table moves the patient through a circular opening in the CT imaging system. Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 10 of 97 While the patient is inside the opening, an X-ray source and a detector assembly within the system rotate around the patient. A single rotation typically takes a second or less. During rotation, the X-ray source produces a narrow, fan-shaped beam of X-rays that passes through a section of the patient's body. Detectors in rows opposite the X-ray source register the X-rays that pass through the patient's body as a snapshot in the process of creating an image. Many different \"snapshots\" (at many angles through the patient) are collected during one complete rotation. For each rotation of the X-ray source and detector assembly, the image data are sent to a computer to reconstruct all of the individual \"snapshots\" into one or multiple cross-sectional images (slices) of the internal organs and tissues.\" (US Food and Drug Administration (FDA); http://www.fda.gov/Radiation- EmittingProducts/RadiationEmittingProductsandProcedures/MedicalImaging/MedicalX-Rays/ucm115317.htm) LDCT is a chest CT scan performed at acquisition settings to minimize radiation exposure compared to a standard chest CT (Smith-Bindman, 2009). Prasad et al. (2002) noted: \"[s]everal factors influence patient radiation dose from CT including tube voltage, tube current, scanning time, pitch, slice thickness, and scanning volume. Radiation dose is linearly related to tube current, scanning time, and scan volume and inversely related to pitch. Although scanning times are decreased on modern helical CT scanners, the radiation dose associated with helical scanners is greater than that of other imaging procedures because of the increased tube current and volume of tissue irradiated.\" While LDCT reduces radiation exposure, image quality is also reduced which in turn may influence readability. Bankier and Tack (2010) noted: \"[t]he concept of reducing the radiation dose in chest CT was first introduced by Naidich et al., (1990) who reduced the tube current on incremental 10-mm collimation CT and showed that with tube current settings as low as 20 mAs, the image quality is sufficient for assessing the lung parenchyma. Although these images were sufficient for diagnostically assessing the lung parenchyma, the increased image noise resulted in marked degradation of the quality of images on mediastinal window settings.\" Given the burden of lung cancer on the United States population, a suitable screening test for lung cancer has been sought for many years. The earliest studies were conducted in the 1960's and 1970's, testing sputum Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 11 of 97 cytology and chest radiography or a combination of both. The initial studies using sputum cytology and/or chest radiography tests failed to conclusively demonstrate improvements in health outcomes, leading the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) to give lung cancer screening a grade D recommendation in 1985 and again in 1996 (Humphrey, 2004). Low dose helical computed tomography began being considered for use as a screening modality starting in the 1990's. Naidich et al. (1990) noted: \"[a]lthough further evaluation is necessary, the potential of low-dose CT for use in the pediatric population in particular, as well as for screening in patients at high risk for developing lung cancer, is apparent.\" With accumulation of evidence on LDCT screening from studies in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the USPSTF updated their recommendation for lung cancer screening to a grade I (insufficient) recommendation and \"found there was insufficient evidence to either recommend for or against routinely screening asymptomatic persons for lung cancer with either low-dose computed tomography (LDCT), chest x-ray (CXR), sputum cytology, or a combination of these tests (I statement)\" (Humphrey et al., 2013). The USPSTF noted that \"screening with LDCT, CXR, or sputum cytology can detect lung cancer at an earlier stage than lung cancer would be detected in an unscreened population; however, the USPSTF found poor evidence that any screening strategy for lung cancer decreases mortality\" (USPSTF, 2004). As with many technologies, the initial studies on lung cancer screening with LDCT were observational case-control and cohort studies to generate hypotheses, show feasibility, and to identify the appropriate screening population. In 2011, the results of the NCI-sponsored National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) were published. The NLST showed that people aged 55 to 74 years with a history of heavy smoking are 20 percent less likely to die from lung cancer if they are screened with low dose helical CT than with standard screening chest x-rays. Previous studies had shown that screening with standard chest x-rays does not reduce the mortality rate from lung cancer. The NLST identified risks as well as benefits. For example, people screened with low dose helical CT had a higher overall rate of false-positive results (that is, findings that appeared to be abnormal even though no cancer was present), leading to a higher rate of invasive procedures (such as bronchoscopy or biopsy), and serious complications from such invasive procedures, than those screened with standard x-rays. (NIH/NCI at http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Detection/CT) In 2014, Moyer and colleagues, on behalf of the USPSTF, released updated recommendations for lung cancer screening: \"The USPSTF recommends annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography in adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Screening should be discontinued once a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery. (B recommendation)\" (Moyer for the USPSTF, 2014). III. History of Medicare Coverage Pursuant to \u00a71861(ddd) of the Social Security Act, the Secretary may add coverage of \"additional preventive services\" if certain statutory requirements are met. Our regulations provide: 42 CFR \u00a7410.64 Additional preventive services Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 12 of 97 Date Action February 10, 2014 (a) Medicare Part B pays for additional preventive services not described in paragraph (1) or (3) of the definition of \"preventive services\" under \u00a7410.2, that identify medical conditions or risk factors for individuals if the Secretary determines through the national coverage determination process (as defined in section 1869(f)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act) that these services are all of the following: (1) Reasonable and necessary for the prevention or early detection of illness or disability. (2) Recommended with a grade of A or B by the United States Preventive Services Task Force. (3) Appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under part A or enrolled under Part B. (b) In making determinations under paragraph (a) of this section regarding the coverage of a new preventive service, the Secretary may conduct an assessment of the relation between predicted outcomes and the expenditures for such services and may take into account the results of such an assessment in making such national coverage determinations. A. Current Request CMS received two formal requests for a national coverage determination (NCD) for lung cancer screening with LDCT, one from Peter B. Bach (Director, Center for Health Policy and Outcomes, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center), and another from Laurie Fenton Ambrose (President & CEO, Lung Cancer Alliance). The formal request letters can be viewed via the tracking sheet for this NCA on the CMS website at http://www.cms.gov/medicare- coverage-database/details/nca-tracking-sheet.aspx?NCAId=274. B. Benefit Category In order to be covered by Medicare, an item or service must fall within one or more benefit categories contained within Part A or Part B and must not be otherwise excluded from coverage. Since January 1, 2009, CMS is authorized to cover \"additional preventive services\" if certain statutory requirements are met as provided under \u00a71861(ddd) of the Social Security Act. IV. Timeline of Recent Activities Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 13 of 97 Date Action CMS initiates this national coverage analysis. A 30-day public comment period began. March 12, 2014 The 30-day public comment period closed. April 30, 2014 CMS convened a meeting of the Medicare Evidence Development & Coverage Advisory Committee concerning the use of LDCT screening for lung cancer. November 10, 2014 CMS posted a proposed national coverage determination for screening for lung cancer with LDCT. A 30-day public comment period on the proposed decision began. December 10, 2014 The 30-day public comment period on the proposed decision closed. [posting date] CMS posted the final national coverage determination. V. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Status Currently, CT imaging systems and post-processing software go through the 510(k) process at the FDA to obtain clearance for commercial distribution. To obtain 510(k) clearance, the sponsor must demonstrate that the device is substantially equivalent to legally marketed predicate devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Device Amendments, or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) that do not require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). CT devices were on the market prior to the passage of the Medical Device Amendments. They were originally indicated for general cross sectional imaging of the body. This includes the lungs and other specific organs. Subsequent modifications based on either additional built-in processing or on post-processing have expanded the breadth of CT images and with that, their use. Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 14 of 97 The condition being screened for should be an important health problem, The natural history of the condition should be well understood, There should be a detectable early stage, Treatment at an early stage should be of more benefit than at a later stage, A suitable test should be devised for the early stage, The test should be acceptable, Intervals for repeating the test should be determined, Adequate health service provision should be made for the extra clinical workload resulting from screening, The risks, both physical and psychological, should be less than the benefits, The costs should be balanced against the benefits.Counseling services are not generally under the purview of the FDA. VI. General Methodological Principles When making national coverage determinations concerning additional preventive services, CMS applies the statutory criteria in \u00a71861(ddd) of the Social Security Act and regulations at 42 CFR 410.64, and evaluates relevant clinical evidence to determine whether or not the service is reasonable and necessary for the prevention or early detection of illness or disability, is recommended with a grade of A or B by the USPSTF, and is appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under Part A or enrolled under Part B of the Medicare program. CMS uses the initial public comments to inform its proposed national coverage determination. CMS responds in detail to the public comments on a proposed national coverage determination when issuing the final national coverage determination. Public comments sometimes cite published clinical evidence and give CMS useful information. Public comments that give information on unpublished evidence such as the results of individual practitioners or patients are less rigorous and therefore less useful for making a coverage determination. Public comments that contain personal health information will not be made available to the public. VII. Evidence A. Introduction While a detailed discussion of screening is beyond the scope of this discussion, the basic parameters were established many years ago and are still well accepted to date. In 1968, Wilson and Jungner reported criteria to consider for screening: (Wilson JMG, Jungner G. Principles and Practice of Screening for Disease. World Health Organization, 1968) Health outcomes, benefits, and risks are important considerations. As Cochrane and Holland (1971) further noted, evidence on health outcomes, i.e., \"evidence that screening can alter the natural history of disease in a significant proportion of those screened,\" is important in the consideration of screening tests since individuals are asymptomatic and \"the practitioner initiates screening procedures.\" Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 15 of 97 a. \"Simplicity. In many screening programmes more than one test is used to detect one disease, and in a multiphasic programme the individual will be subjected to a number of tests within a short space of time. It is therefore essential that the tests used should be easy to administer and should be capable of use by para-medical and other personnel. b. Acceptability. As screening is in most instances voluntary and a high rate of co-operation is necessary in an efficient screening programme, it is important that tests should be acceptable to the subjects. c. Accuracy. The test should give a true measurement of the attribute under investigation. d. Cost. The expense of screening should be considered in relation to the benefits resulting from the early detection of disease, i.e., the severity of the disease, the advantages of treatment at an early stage and the probability of cure. e. Precision (sometimes called repeatability). The test should give consistent results in repeated trials. f.Sensitivity. This may be defined as the ability of the test to give a positive finding when the individual screened has the disease or abnormality under investigation. g. Specificity. This may be defined as the ability of the test to give a negative finding when the individual screened does not have the disease or abnormality under investigation\". The USPSTF recommends annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography in adults ages 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Screening should be discontinued once a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery. Grade: B recommendation. Grade Definition Suggestions for Practice B Offer or provide this service. The evaluation of screening tests has been largely standardized in the medical and scientific communities, and the \"value of a screening test may be assessed according to the following criteria: (Cochrane A and Holland W. Validation of screening procedures. British Medical Bulletin 1971;27(1):3-8. PMID: 5100948). B. United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) The USPSTF recommendation for lung cancer screening with LDCT (December 2013) states: The USPSTF assigns one of five letter grades to each of its recommendations (A, B, C, D, I). The following tables from the USPSTF website provide the current grade definitions and descriptions of levels of certainty. (http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/grades.htm) Grade Definitions After July 2012 Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 16 of 97 Grade Definition Suggestions for Practice The USPSTF recommends the service. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial. C The USPSTF recommends selectively offering or providing this service to individual patients based on professional judgment and patient preferences. There is at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small. Offer or provide this service for selected patients depending on individual circumstances. D The USPSTF recommends against the service. There is moderate or high certainty that the service has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits. Discourage the use of this service. I Statement The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. Read the clinical considerations section of USPSTF Recommendation Statement. If the service is offered, patients should understand the uncertainty about the balance of benefits and harms. Level of CertaintyDescription High The available evidence usually includes consistent results from well- designed, well-conducted studies in representative primary care populations. These studies assess the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes. This conclusion is therefore unlikely to be strongly affected by the results of future studies. Moderate Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 17 of 97 Level of CertaintyDescription The available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate is constrained by such factors as: The number, size, or quality of individual studies. Inconsistency of findings across individual studies. Limited generalizability of findings to routine primary care practice. Lack of coherence in the chain of evidence. As more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large enough to alter the conclusion. Low The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes. Evidence is insufficient because of: The limited number or size of studies. Important flaws in study design or methods. Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 18 of 97 Level of CertaintyDescription Inconsistency of findings across individual studies. Gaps in the chain of evidence. Findings not generalizable to routine primary care practice. Lack of information on important health outcomes. More information may allow estimation of effects on health outcomes. * The USPSTF defines certainty as \"likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct.\" The net benefit is defined as benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service. C.

Page 22 of 97 Humphrey and colleagues reported the results of a systematic review to re-evaluate the effectiveness of LDCT screening for lung cancer for the USPSTF. Trials and cohort studies that evaluated screening or treatment interventions for lung cancer that reported health outcomes were eligible. Searching from 2000 to May 2013, seven trials met criteria, with four trials that were included in the review because they reported results for both intervention and control groups. The NLST (NLST team, 2012; n = 53,454) compared radiography. The authors stated: \"One large good-quality trial reported that screening was associated with significant reductions in lung cancer (20 %) and all-cause (6.7 %) mortality. Three small European trials showed no benefit of screening. Harms included radiation exposure, overdiagnosis, and a high rate of false positive findings that typically were resolved with further imaging. Smoking cessation was not affected. Incidental findings were common.\" Figure 1. Page 414. Ann Intern Med. 2013 Sep 17;159(6):411-20. The authors concluded: \"Strong evidence shows that LDCT screening can reduce lung cancer and all-cause mortality.

PMID: Manser and colleagues reported the results of a Cochrane systematic review \"to determine whether screening for lung cancer, using regular sputum examinations, chest radiography or CT scanning of the chest, reduces lung cancer mortality.\" Controlled trials were included. This report updated the original review performed in 1999. The authors reported: \"We included nine trials in the review (eight randomised controlled studies and one controlled trial) with a total of 453,965 subjects. In one large study that included both smokers and non-smokers comparing annual chest x-ray screening with usual care there was no reduction in lung cancer mortality (RR 0.99, 95 % CI 0.91 to 1.07). In a meta-analysis of studies comparing different frequencies of chest x-ray screening, frequent screening with chest x-rays was associated with an 11 % relative increase in mortality from lung cancer compared with less frequent screening (RR 1.11, 95 % CI 1.00 to 1.23); however several of the trials included in this meta-analysis had potential methodological weaknesses. We observed a non-statistically significant trend to reduced mortality from lung cancer when screening with chest x-ray and sputum cytology was compared with chest x-ray alone (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.03). There was one large methodologically rigorous trial in high- risk smokers and ex-smokers (those aged 55 to 74 years with 30 pack-years of smoking and who quit 15 Printed on 11/4/2015.

Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2013 Jun 21;6:CD001991. The authors concluded: \"The current evidence does not support screening for lung cancer with chest radiography or sputum cytology.

They reported: \"The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) was the first study that provided statistical evidence that LD-CT screening for lung cancer significantly reduces lung Printed on 11/4/2015.

Major obstacles in lung cancer screening are overdiagnosis and the large number of false positive results. In the NLST, more than 24 % of the screens were positive, most of which (96.4 %) proved to be benign in nature. Optimized protocols for the workup of detected nodules may help to reduce the number of false-positive screens.\" They further noted: \"Long-term follow-up data are still anticipated on the European screening trials.

Patients with comorbidities that limited life expectancy to < 5 years, had a previous history of malignancy, or who were unable to comply with study protocols were excluded. Primary outcome was lung cancer mortality. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, lung cancer incidence, stage and resectability. Between March 2001 and February 2006, 2811 participants were randomly assigned and 2472 were enrolled to yearly LDCT screening for four years (n = 1276) or yearly medical care control (n = 1196) at three sites in Italy.

It was \"estimated that each NLST low-dose CT resulted in an average effective dose of 1.5 mSv, whereas the effective dose from conventional chest CT varies considerably in clinical practice but is on the order of 8 mSv\" (NLST study design, 2011). The primary outcome was lung cancer mortality. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality and lung cancer incidence.

CT screening for lung cancer brings forward early disease. The randomised Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial: status after five annual screening rounds reported the results of a randomized controlled trial \"to evaluate if annual low dose CT screening [for 5 annual screenings] can reduce lung cancer mortality by more than 25 %\" (Pederson, 2009). Inclusion criteria were age 50-70 years, current or former smokers with at least 20 pack-years of smoking history, ability to climb two flights of stairs (36 steps) without pausing. Exclusion criteria were \"weight over 130 kg, history of cancer diagnosis and treatment, lung tuberculosis, illness that would shorten life expectancy to < 10 years and chest CT received during the last year for any reason.\" Primary outcome was lung cancer mortality. Secondary outcomes included overall mortality, number of lung cancers, stage and health economic evaluations. From October 2004 to March 2006, 4104 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to CT screening group (five annual LDCT; n = 2052) or control group (no screening) (n = 2052) at one site in Denmark. \"All participants had an annual visit at the screening clinic, where lung function tests were performed, and questionnaires concerning health, lifestyle, smoking habits and psychosocial consequences of screening were completed.\" Median age was not reported (peak number of patients were between 55-59 years). Men comprised 55 % of the study population. Median follow-up was 4.81 years. The authors reported: \"At the end of screening, 61 patients died in the screening group and 42 in the control group (p = 0.059). 15 and 11 died of lung cancer, respectively (p = 0.428).\" They concluded: \"CT screening for lung cancer brings forward early disease, and at this point no stage shift or reduction in mortality was observed. More lung cancers were diagnosed in the screening group, indicating some degree of over diagnosis and need for longer follow-up.\" 3.

This is a grade I recommendation.\" As reported in the analysis, \"The USPSTF found fair evidence that screening with LDCT, CXR or sputum cytology can detect lung cancer at an earlier stage than lung cancer would be detected in an unscreened population; however, the USPSTF found poor evidence that any screening strategy for lung cancer decreases mortality. Because of the invasive nature of diagnostic testing and the possibility of a high number of false-positive tests in certain populations, there is potential for significant harms from screening. Therefore, the USPSTF could not determine the balance between the benefits and harms of screening for lung cancer.\" Moyer VA; U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

ACR CT Accreditation Program and the Lung Cancer Screening Program Designation. J Am Coll Radiol. 2014 Nov print] PMID: 25455196 The authors reported the current position statement of the American College of Radiology: \"The ACR strongly supports the use of LDCT for lung cancer screening and believes that the ability of this technique to reduce mortality depends on appropriate patient selection, the performance of high-quality, low-radiation exposure LDCT examinations interpreted by qualified physicians, and a structured reporting and management system as the foundation for quality reporting and outcomes monitoring. Building on extensive ACR experience with breast cancer screening, including the comprehensive widespread use of BI-RADS\u00ae, imaging accreditation, quality metrics, and both clinical and research registries, the ACR has focused on expeditiously bringing tools to practicing radiologists to promote the dissemination of high-quality lung cancer screening. The ACR-Society of Thoracic Radiology (STR) Practice Parameter for the Performance and Reporting of Lung Cancer Screening Thoracic CT 2014 (Resolution 4) provides guidance on indications and contraindications, specifications of the examination, interpretation and reporting, documentation and communication, and equipment specifications. The first edition of the ACR's Lung-RADS presents a structured management, reporting, and audit schema for lung cancer screening practice and quality assurance (QA). In addition, the ACR has collected lung cancer screening resources on a single web page for individuals, practices, and institutions. Provided links include the 2014 CT protocols from The American Association of Physicists in Medicine, and smoking cessation resources, an important component of any lung cancer screening program. Lastly, as part of the ACR suite of registries under the National Radiology Data Registry, the ACR will launch the Lung Cancer Screening Practice Registry in early 2015. Use of the registry will enable providers to perform clinical practice audits and compare their cancer detection rates, false positives, and positive predictive value rates against benchmarks similar to the standards used in mammography.

[Epub ahead of print] PMID: 25356819 The authors presented a joint position statement endorsed by the American College of Chest Physicians, American Thoracic Society, American Association of Thoracic Surgery, American Cancer Society, and American Society of Preventive Oncology: \"Lung cancer screening with a low dose chest CT scan can result in more benefit than harm when performed in settings committed to developing and maintaining high quality programs. This project aimed to identify the components of screening that should be a part of all lung cancer screening programs. To do so, committees with expertise in lung cancer screening were assembled by the Thoracic Oncology Network of the ACCP and the Thoracic Oncology Assembly of the ATS. Lung cancer program components were derived from evidence-based reviews of lung cancer screening, and supplemented by expert opinion. This statement was developed and modified based on iterative feedback of the committees. Nine essential components of a lung cancer screening program were identified. Within these components twenty one Policy Statements were developed and translated into criteria that could be used to assess the qualification of a program as a screening facility. Two additional Policy Statements related to the need for multi-society governance of lung cancer screening were developed. High quality lung cancer screening programs can be developed within the presented framework of nine essential program components outlined by our committees.\" The components are: Component 1: Who is offered lung cancer screening; Component 2: How often, and for how long, to screen; Component 3: How the CT is performed; Component 4: Lung nodule identification; Component 5: reporting; 6: algorithms; Component 7: Patient provider education; Component 9: Data collection; Printed on 11/4/2015.

American Cancer Society lung cancer screening guidelines. CA Cancer J Clin. 2013 Mar- Apr;63(2):107-17. doi: 23315954 In 2013, Wender and colleagues, on behalf of the American Cancer Society, released lung cancer screening guidelines: \"Findings from the National Cancer Institute's National Lung Screening Trial established that lung cancer mortality in specific high-risk groups can be reduced by annual screening with low-dose computed tomography. These findings indicate that the adoption of lung cancer screening could save many lives. Based on the results of the National Lung Screening Trial, the American Cancer Society is issuing an initial guideline for lung cancer screening. This guideline recommends that clinicians with access to high-volume, high-quality lung cancer screening and treatment centers should initiate a discussion about screening with apparently healthy patients aged 55 years to 74 years who have at least a 30-pack-year smoking history and who currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. A process of informed and shared decision making with a clinician related to the potential benefits, limitations, and harms associated with screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography should occur before any decision is made to initiate lung cancer screening. Smoking cessation counseling remains a high priority for clinical attention in discussions with current smokers, who should be informed of their continuing risk of lung cancer. Screening should not be viewed as an alternative to smoking cessation.\" (American Cancer Society: http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/cid/documents/webcontent/acspc-039558- pdf.pdf)) \"The American Cancer Society has thoroughly reviewed the subject of lung cancer screening and issued guidelines that are aimed at doctors and other health care providers: Patients should be asked about their smoking history. Patients who meet ALL of the following criteria may be candidates for lung cancer screening: These criteria were based on what was used in the NLST. Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 36 of 97 Doctors should talk to these patients about the benefits, limitations, and potential harms of lung cancer screening. Screening should only be done at facilities that have the right type of CT scan and that have a great deal of experience in LDCT scans for lung cancer screening. The facility should also have a team of specialists that can provide the appropriate care and follow-up of patients with abnormal results on the scans. Screening is meant to find cancer in people who do not have symptoms of the disease. People who already have symptoms that might be caused by lung cancer may need tests such as CT scans to find the underlying cause, which in some cases may be cancer. Still, this kind of testing is for diagnosis and is not the same as screening. Some of the possible symptoms of lung cancer that kept people out of the NLST were coughing up blood and weight loss without trying. To get the most potential benefit from screening, patients need to be in good health. For example, they need to be able to have surgery and other treatments to try to cure lung cancer if it is found. Patients who require home oxygen therapy most likely could not withstand having part of a lung removed, and so are not candidates for screening. Patients with other serious medical problems that would shorten their lives or keep them from having surgery may also not be able to benefit enough from screening for it to be worth the risks, and so should also not be screened. Metal implants in the chest (like pacemakers) or back (like rods in the spine) can interfere with x-rays and lead to poor quality CT images of the lungs. People with these types of implants were also kept out of the NLST, and so should not be screened with CT scans for lung cancer according to the ACS guidelines. People who have been treated for lung cancer often have follow-up tests, including CT scans to see if the cancer has come back or spread. This is called surveillance and is not the same as screening. (People with a prior history of lung cancer were not eligible for the NLST.)\" We note that the American College of Radiology commented on the American Cancer Society screening guidelines (described earlier). \"The American College of Radiology (ACR) acknowledges the importance of the new American Cancer Society recommendations for lung cancer screening using computed tomography (CT) scans. The ACR stresses that guidelines and practice standards are needed, and must be appropriately implemented, to ensure that patients nationwide have access to uniform, quality care and can expect a similar life-saving benefit from these exams as demonstrated in clinical trials. Such guidelines must take into consideration the potential for false positives, incidental findings and other consequences that might negatively impact patients. The ACR is working on a practice guideline as well as ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae based on thorough vetting of the peer reviewed literature.\" 'We continue to push forward in our work on standards regarding how and when these screening exams are conducted to help make sure that those who should be screened can do so regardless of where they live, but these standards need adequate time to be finalized to support a robust screening program that will provide the life-saving results that everyone wants,' said Paul Ellenbogen, MD, FACR, chair of the ACR Board of Chancellors.\" Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 37 of 97 The ACR supports the use of techniques shown to significantly reduce the number of people who die each year from lung cancer. Recent evidence, particularly results of the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST), has shown that CT lung cancer screening is appropriate when performed in the context of careful patient selection and follow-up. However, barriers to widespread access to CT lung cancer screening remain \u2014 including acceptance of the cost- effectiveness of such a national screening program by Medicare and private insurers and associated coverage of these exams. While some insurers cover these exams, many may be waiting for the cost-effectiveness data from the NLST to be published later this year.\" 6.

Ann Intern Med. 2014 Mar 4;160(5):311-20. doi: 10.7326/M13-2316. PMID: 24379002 de Koning and colleagues reported the results of simulation models of LDCT lung cancer screening scenarios \"to estimate future harms and benefits of lung cancer screening and identify a set of possible efficient lung cancer screening policies by using 5 separately developed microsimulation models calibrated to the 2 largest randomized controlled trials on lung cancer screening.\" Five simulation models [Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands (model E); Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington (model F); the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts (model M); Stanford University in Stanford, California (model S); and the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan (model U)] were calibrated according to the NLST and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). In all models, 100 % adherence was assumed. The investigators reported: \"The most advantageous strategy was annual screening from ages 55 through 80 years for ever smokers with a smoking history of at least 30 pack-years and ex-smokers with less than 15 years since quitting. It would lead to 50 % (model ranges, 45 % to 54 %) of cases of cancer being detected at an early stage (stage I/II), 575 screenings examinations per lung cancer death averted, a 14 % (range, 8.2 % to 23.5 %) reduction in lung cancer mortality, 497 lung cancer deaths averted, and 5250 life-years gained per the 100 000- member cohort. Harms would include 67 550 false-positive test results, 910 biopsies or surgeries for benign lesions, and 190 over diagnosed cases of cancer (3.7 % of all cases of lung cancer [model ranges, 1.4 % to 8.3 %]).\" Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 38 of 97 It is unclear why and how the PLCO (Oken, 2011), which evaluated chest x-ray screening, was used in model calibration. The simulation of LDCT screening appears to be based entirely on the NLST results and parameters since no other trial on LDCT was included. Sensitivity analysis of harms was specifically reported. Specific harms of follow-up were not listed. 7. Public Comments The comments received on the proposed national coverage determination can be viewed in their entirety on the CMS Website at: http://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/details/nca-view-public- comments.aspx?NCAId=274. During the initial 30-day comment period (2/10/2014 - 3/12/2014), CMS received 330 comments from various entities including providers, advocacy organizations, academic institutions, trade associations, and the general public. Of the comments received, 278 commenters advocated for coverage of lung cancer screening with LDCT, 27 supported coverage with conditions, 2 opposed, and 23 did not express a position. During the 30-day comment period on the proposed NCD (11/10/2014 - 12/10/2014), CMS received 133 comments from various entities including professional medical societies, medical professionals and facilities, imaging centers, patient advocacy organizations, research consultants, device manufacturers, and the general public. Commenters were generally supportive of the proposed national coverage determination to expand Medicare coverage to include lung cancer screening as an additional preventive service. A number of commenters supported coverage of lung cancer screening with LDCT noting that it is a positive step forward and provides for early detection of lung cancer in appropriate beneficiaries at high risk. Supportive commenters also believed that the proposed national coverage determination balances the risks, harms, and benefits of screening, while ensuring appropriate access to these services, and believed that lung cancer screening with LDCT requires careful implementation in centers of proven expertise in chest radiology, pulmonary thoracic surgery, and medical and radiation oncology, in a multidisciplinary and coordinated effort with registry management of findings and follow-up. Some commenters expressed their support while also raising points for CMS to consider and suggested modifications to the proposed NCD. Some commenters did not express an opinion on the proposed NCD. Commenters addressed additional risk factors for lung cancer and conditions like asbestosis and radon exposure. A few commenters were opposed to coverage for these services, with some opining that if individuals choose to smoke that Medicare funds should not be used for screening and treatment of resulting conditions. Others suggested that Medicare should consider coverage for other screening modalities instead of lung cancer screening Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 39 of 97 with LDCT. Commenters provided feedback on, and suggested modifications to, the proposed coverage requirements for beneficiaries, radiologists, and imaging centers. Our responses to the public comments are addressed below. Beneficiary Eligibility Criteria Comment: Commenters suggested that CMS reassess the proposed age criteria of 55-74, specifically to expand coverage for beneficiaries up to age 80, with some commenters opining that the median age of diagnosis of 70 suggests that those older than 74 would also benefit from screening. Many commenters believed that the age criteria should align with the USPSTF recommendation, with a few commenters opining that CMS' proposed national coverage determination would violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution since private insurers cover preventive services consistent with USPSTF recommendations for these services. Some commenters recommended expanding coverage based on modeling studies. Other commenters suggested that a beneficiary's overall health status is a better indicator of how a beneficiary will handle cancer treatments rather than a specific age range and suggested eliminating the age criteria in its entirety. Response: We do not agree with the commenters that suggest that the proposed age range and coverage requirements violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. By its terms, that amendment applies to States and not to the Federal government. Additionally, the statute governing \"additional preventive services\" for the Medicare program, \u00a71861(ddd) of the Social Security Act, is not the same as the statute governing coverage of preventive health services for group health plans under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13. The statute governing coverage of preventive services for group health plans ensures coverage of certain immunizations and additional preventive services for infants, children, adolescents and women that are not included in title XVIII of the Social Security Act. The two statutes are not identical and the commenters are comparing two groups of patients who are not similarly situated. Although it is true that both statutes recognize the importance of items and services that have received grade A or B recommendations by the USPSTF, the Medicare statute also enables the Secretary to consider whether the service is \"reasonable and necessary for the prevention or early detection of an illness or disability\" and \"appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under part A or enrolled in part B\" before adding a new preventive service under part B. We believe that these two aspects of Section 1861(ddd) of the Social Security Act provide the authority to treat Medicare beneficiaries differently. Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 40 of 97 As discussed in the analysis, our age range was set using the enrollment age criteria of the NLST. As the study participants continued with the three annual screenings, benefit and harms data were recorded on participants up to and including the age of 77 years. Data on these patients were analyzed along with the other trial participants to demonstrate overall benefits. In the age specific analysis (Pinsky, 2014), no statistically significant increase in harms was reported. Therefore, we are modifying the beneficiary eligibility criteria to include beneficiaries 55 to 77 years of age. There is no empirical data available for adults aged 78-80 years nor is there adequate evidence to cover LDCT screening for individuals beyond 55 - 77 years of age. Data from well-done randomized controlled trials provide the strongest evidence. We believe data from modeling is inadequate to ensure that the service would be \"reasonable and necessary\" or \"appropriate\" for Medicare beneficiaries, for purposes of \u00a71861(ddd) of the Social Security Act. Comment: Several commenters requested that CMS modify the asymptomatic criterion. Commenters believed that to require the beneficiary show no signs or symptoms of lung disease would inappropriately limit coverage for this benefit. One commenter suggested allowing coverage for all beneficiaries, regardless of whether they had signs or symptoms of lung disease. Response: In response to the commenters' concerns, we are modifying this beneficiary eligibility criterion to state that a beneficiary must be \"asymptomatic (no signs or symptoms of lung cancer)\", consistent with the evidence reviewed and comments received. Comment: A few commenters suggested that Medicare cover NCCN Group 2 (ages 50-54, 20-pack year smoking history, and one additional risk factor for lung cancer) under coverage with evidence development. Commenters opined that individuals in NCCN Group 2 are equivalent to individuals that would fall under NCCN Group 1. Other commenters asked for expanded coverage to those who have quit smoking more than 15 years ago. Response: The NLST was the only trial (of several trials and observational studies over the past decade) to show benefits of lung cancer screening with LDCT. The NLST provided the evidence to determine that this service is \"reasonable and necessary\" and \"appropriate\" for Medicare beneficiaries. We did not find evidence of improvements in health outcomes in other populations, such as those suggested by the commenters (for instance, individuals that have a smoking cessation history greater than 15 years and individuals with a 20-pack year smoking history). We will continue to closely monitor ongoing trials, which we believe will improve the evidence base, and will consider modifying coverage in the future as appropriate. Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 41 of 97 Counseling and Shared Decision Making Visit/Written Orders Comment: Commenters generally supported the requirement that for the initial LDCT lung cancer screening, beneficiaries obtain a written order from a counseling and shared decision making visit. Others suggested that requiring a separate visit was difficult to incorporate into normal physician practice, and that mandating a face-to-face visit would limit access to screening services for beneficiaries in rural areas. One commenter questioned the need for the shared decision making visit if the written order was properly documented. Commenters also asked whether the counseling and shared decision making visit would be required for individuals that started lung cancer screening prior to becoming Medicare beneficiaries. Response: We believe that a counseling and shared decision making visit that addresses the benefits and harms of screening is supported by the evidence and is essential for ensuring that appropriate eligible beneficiaries receive these initial services with full knowledge of the risks, benefits, and commitment necessary to receive the most benefit from a lung cancer screening program. Among other things, there is the potential for significant harms in starting a lung cancer screening program, including the risk for false-positive results leading to additional tests and treatments that may be more harmful. The goal of shared decision making is not merely to furnish a written order for such services, but that both the practitioner and the beneficiary are armed with a better understanding of the relevant risk factors, and are engaged with shared responsibility regarding the decision to proceed or not proceed with a lung cancer screening program. We believe that the initial counseling and shared decision making visit supports identification of individuals that would most benefit from a lung cancer screening program. Comment: Commenters requested clarification about who could furnish the initial counseling and shared decision making visit, with others opining that nurses, psychologists, and imaging facilities should also be eligible to furnish these services. Response: We believe that formal shared decision making between the physician or qualified non-physician practitioner and the beneficiary is an important and essential component to an effective lung cancer screening program. We leave it to the discretion of the physician or qualified non-physician practitioner to determine whether other medical professionals should also participate in the visit based on a particular beneficiary's needs. Therefore, we are maintaining the requirement that the counseling and shared decision making visit must be furnished by a physician or qualified non-physician practitioner. Comment: A few commenters asked whether standardized instruments existed that could be used during the initial counseling and shared decision making visit and whether such instruments would need to be approved by CMS. Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 42 of 97 Response: We understand that specific decision aids for lung cancer screening are being developed and will become more readily available as screening is more broadly adopted. While we are not requiring the use of a specific instrument, eligible practitioners may select from various available decision aids designed for this purpose and recognized by national professional medical organizations. For instance, the National Institutes of Health's National Cancer Institute has developed a decision aid/tool, available at: http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/qa/2002/NLSTstudyGuidePatientsPhysicians. Comment: For subsequent screenings, some commenters disagreed with the requirement that the beneficiary must receive a written order. Other commenters requested clarification about how a written order for subsequent screenings should be obtained. Response: We agree that for subsequent screenings, a separate counseling and shared decision making visit (as required for the initial screening) would be overly burdensome. However, we believe that in order to balance the benefits, harms, and complex nature of this service, the beneficiary needs to obtain a written order for subsequent screenings to support continued shared decision making in light of the beneficiary's changing health status, particularly as one ages. For example, the Medicare-covered annual wellness visit (AWV) may be one option for obtaining such an order. The AWV includes elements for the furnishing of appropriate referrals and orders for preventive services. Therefore, we are maintaining the criterion that a beneficiary must receive a written order for subsequent screenings during any appropriate visit with a physician or qualified non-physician practitioner. While we are not requiring a separate counseling and shared decision making visit for subsequent screenings, we are modifying this criterion to note that if a physician or qualified non-physician practitioner chooses to furnish a counseling and shared decision making visit for subsequent screenings, the visit must include all of the components required for an initial counseling and shared decision making visit as defined in this NCD. Reading Radiologist Eligibility Criteria Comment: Commenters suggested that CMS modify the proposed requirements for radiologists eligible to perform lung cancer screening to add board eligibility in addition to proposed board certification. Another commenter suggested that CMS remove the requirement for board certification. Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 43 of 97 Response: In response to the comments received, we are modifying the criterion to indicate that reading radiologists eligible to furnish these services must be board certified or board eligible with the American Board of Radiology or equivalent organization. These modifications are consistent with the evidence reviewed, including the NLST, where the reading radiologists were American Board of Radiology certified or board-eligible or had equivalent qualifications as defined by the American College of Radiology Practice Guidelines. Radiology Imaging Facility Eligibility Criteria Comment: Commenters suggested modifications to the coverage requirements for radiology imaging facilities. Some commenters asked that CMS allow screening to be performed by an accredited provider of chest CT with training and experience in LDCT lung cancer screening. Other commenters requested clarification on how the criteria to be an advanced diagnostic imaging center would be met. One commenter requested that CMS use a professional medical society's lung cancer screening center certification program as a template for facility certification. Another commenter noted that all centers should meet the same eligibility requirements. One commenter suggested that screening should only be covered in imaging facilities that participated in lung cancer screening trials since the commenter opined that the value of lung cancer screening varies markedly depending on how it is implemented. A few commenters were concerned that without quality requirements, patients could be at risk for over-exposure to radiation and/or have poor quality exams, resulting in additional harm and missed cancers. Other commenters suggested other facility types may be appropriate to perform these services, such as hospital imaging departments. Commenters also opined that requiring past participation in the NLST or advanced diagnostic imaging center accreditation with training and experience in LDCT lung cancer screening would place an undue burden on patients and rural facilities. Some commenters recommended that CMS acknowledge professional society accreditation or participation in other studies besides the NLST for purposes of meeting the eligibility criteria, while also ensuring quality standards. Response: We appreciate the commenters' extensive feedback regarding the proposed imaging facility eligibility criteria. While we agree with some of the commenters that requiring past participation in the NLST or advanced diagnostic imaging center accreditation with experience in LDCT lung cancer screening would place an undue burden on imaging facilities, we also agree with the commenters who expressed concern that without quality requirements, beneficiaries could be exposed to additional harms. Included in CMS' review of the evidence were evidence- based recommendations on the necessary components of a high quality lung cancer screening program. As reported by Mazzone and colleagues (2014), necessary components include, among other things, the establishment of a lung nodule identification, classification, and reporting system; and integration of smoking cessation interventions into a lung cancer screening program. Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 44 of 97 Based on the evidence reviewed, including the public comments received, and to ensure appropriate access to these services, we are modifying the imaging facility eligibility criteria by removing the requirement for either past participation in lung cancer screening trials or advanced diagnostic imaging accreditation with training and experience in LDCT lung cancer screening. We are requiring that imaging facilities utilize standardized lung nodule identification, classification, and reporting systems, and make available smoking cessation interventions for current smokers, based on the evidence reviewed. We believe these modifications strike an appropriate balance between maintaining appropriate and high quality access to these services, while reducing burden. Comment: Regarding the effective radiation dose, commenters suggested various technical revisions including that the radiation dose should be as low as possible, and that CMS should allow for adjustments based on the size of the individual. Some commenters opined that milligray (mGy) is a more common measurement than millisievert (mSv) for expressing volumetric dose. Response: We are revising the imaging facility eligibility criteria in light of the public comments. The proposed radiation dose was developed to align with the NLST. The NLST research team (2011) reported that the acquisition variables were chosen to reduce exposure to an average effective dose of 1.5 mSv.\" Based on the comments received and the evidence reviewed (including recently published evidence-based multi-society, multi-disciplinary professional guidelines), we are modifying the imaging facility criteria to state that an eligible facility must be one that performs LDCT with volumetric CT dose index (CTDIvol) of 3.0 mGy (milligray) for standard size patients (defined to be 5' 7\" tall; and approximately 155 pounds) with appropriate reductions in CTDIvol for smaller patients and appropriate increases in CTDIvol for larger patients. Registry Requirements and Data Elements Comment: Some commenters expressed concern about the feasibility of tracking and submitting registry data related to diagnostic follow-up, cancer incidence, and lung-cancer/all-cause mortality. Commenters were concerned that tracking diagnostic procedures and outcomes may be logistically difficult since diagnostic follow-up may not necessarily be carried out at the center performing the LDCT screening. A few commenters suggested that a registry is not needed for these services and would limit access to screening (particularly in small, non-academic facilities). Others indicated that the number of data elements proposed is overly burdensome. Commenters' suggested alternatives included limiting registry data elements to those items that could be ascertained at the time of the screen or shortly thereafter (screening results). Some commenters suggested adding additional data elements to the registry that capture other risks for lung cancer. One commenter suggested that CMS review and reference current consensus guidelines from various professional societies as a reporting mechanism. One commenter requested information about existing registries that would meet CMS requirements, while another asked for clarification about the objectives, planned uses of the registry data, requirements for registry administration, and CMS solicitation and approval of registries.

Page 45 of 97 Data Type Minimum Required Data Elements Facility Identifier Radiologist (reading) National Provider Identifier (NPI) Patient Identifier Ordering Practitioner National Provider Identifier (NPI) CT scanner Manufacturer, Model Indication Lung cancer LDCT screening - absence of signs or symptoms of lung cancer Response: The primary purpose for requiring the submission of data to the registry is to document compliance with the coverage criteria that are not evidenced on the health care claim. Furthermore, based on the public comments and the evidence reviewed, we strongly believe that the registry will serve as an aid to those seeking to study the clinical benefits of this screening. The registry and the other criteria required in this NCD are supported by the evidence reviewed, including the NLST. The registry will help ensure that only eligible beneficiaries will receive this screening service since only beneficiaries that meet the eligibility requirements will benefit from such screening. Furthermore, we recognize the impact of this criterion for imaging facilities. We will only require production of the minimum number of data elements to carry out this payment function in an effort to reduce burdens. Therefore, we are modifying the data registry elements, based on our review of the evidence and feedback received from commenters. As amended, the data elements are limited to those required to determine whether an individual has met the coverage criteria for the LDCT lung cancer screening service, that is, whether their receipt of the service was \"reasonable and necessary\" and \"appropriate.\" Data collected and submitted to a CMS- approved national registry must include, at minimum, all of the following elements: Printed on 11/4/2015.

Establishment of a steering committee and a governance board for oversight of the registry; b. Registry management plan, including identification of key personnel; c. Operational plan and framework that describes mechanisms for collection and submission of data from imaging facilities to the registry; d. Registry catchment area;Additionally, national registries are strongly encouraged to collect data on lung nodules (for example: clinically significant non-lung cancer findings, the number and types of nodules, and size and location of each nodule), subsequent diagnostic testing, adverse events, and intermediate and long term health outcomes, in order to inform practices and policymakers about the ability to implement a LDCT lung cancer screening program broadly in multiple settings across the country, and achieve positive outcomes, consistent with the NLST. We recognize that these other data elements are extremely important to establishing the benefit of these screening services and improvement in health outcomes. We strongly encourage submission of such data elements to registries in addition to the minimum elements required under this NCD. These data will not only verify that screening leads to improved health outcomes for the Medicare population, but will also serve as the basis to refine and improve screening in practice, and serve the quality improvement purposes of screening facilities. We believe that multi- society stakeholders are in the best position to determine the appropriate data elements for reaching these goals, and to adjust the particular elements over time. All CMS-approved registries must have the capacity and capability to collect data from any Medicare-eligible imaging facility/department that furnishes lung cancer screening with LDCT, with a catchment area that includes all 50 States, United States Territories, and the District of Columbia. CMS will evaluate each entity interested in participating as a CMS-approved registry to determine if they are capable of meeting the registry and data collection requirements outlined in this national coverage determination, including: Printed on 11/4/2015.

Additional Comments Comment: One commenter asked that CMS ensure that lung cancer screening is performed as a part of a dedicated, multi- disciplinary program to image, diagnose and manage high risk patients and opined that lung cancer screening is only one part of the paradigm of management of high risk patients in order to achieve positive results with lung cancer screening. Response: We have set coverage criteria to implement lung cancer screening with LDCT in a responsible manner as part of a lung cancer screening program, in order to ensure positive outcomes of this screening service in the Medicare population. These coverage criteria are consistent with the evidence reviewed including the NLST and information about \"implementation of a lung cancer screening program\" from the USPSTF (Moyer 2014). Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 48 of 97 Comment: One commenter expressed concern about possible over-diagnosis of lung cancer in the screened population and the effect that screening would have on post-lobectomy survival rates. Response: We appreciate these commenters' concerns. They also reflect the concerns raised by the MEDCAC. We acknowledge that there is the potential for significant harms in starting a lung cancer screening program, including the risk for false-positive results leading to additional tests and treatments that may be more harmful. There are potential benefits of lung cancer screening with LDCT if implemented carefully. We are establishing specific beneficiary, provider and imaging facility eligibility requirements, along with inclusion of a counseling and shared decision making visit to ensure that the benefits of screening outweigh harms for the Medicare population. Comment: A few commenters were opposed to Medicare coverage of lung cancer screening with LDCT, with some commenters suggesting that other screening methods, such as breath tests, should be considered for coverage instead of lung cancer screening with LDCT. A few commenters believe that Medicare funds should not be used for lung cancer screening in individuals who have chosen to smoke. A few commenters asked about other risk factors for lung cancer such as radon or asbestos exposure. Response: We appreciate the commenters' concerns since lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. At this time, there are no other proven screening tests. The USPSTF grade B recommendation was limited to patients with a history of smoking and the evidence in the NLST focused on heavy smoking. Therefore, we consider these suggestions to be outside the scope of this national coverage analysis. In order to consider adding screening for lung cancer for additional indications or conditions, there would need to be a specific recommendation from the USPSTF along with evidence concerning the other factors identified in \u00a71861(ddd) of the Social Security Act and regulations at 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.64. We believe that this national coverage determination implements lung cancer screening with LDCT in a responsible manner. CMS will continue to monitor the evidence as stewards of the Medicare program. We strongly encourage Medicare beneficiaries to stop smoking since smoking is a major risk factor for development of lung cancer. Comment: A few commenters requested information about coding, reimbursement, and Medicare-covered tobacco cessation counseling services. Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 49 of 97 Response: While coding and reimbursement are outside the scope of this national coverage analysis, we plan to develop appropriate educational materials, including a Medicare Learning Network article. Information regarding Medicare coverage of tobacco cessation counseling services can be found in Pub. 100-03, Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual, Chapter 1, Sections 210.4 and 210.4.1. Comment: One commenter believed that CMS did not have authority to designate eligibility criteria for facilities and radiologists because medical licensure is determined by State governments. Response: While we agree that medical licensure is primarily a State responsibility, Congress has frequently established specific conditions of coverage or payment for particular services under the Medicare program. Congress has expressly authorized CMS to add coverage for additional preventive services under certain conditions as set forth in \u00a71861(ddd) of the Act, when those services are found to be appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under part A or enrolled under part B, as determined via the NCD process. As part of this appropriateness determination, it is reasonable to consider the qualification of the radiologists and facilities that may be furnishing this new service. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to expand coverage for a new preventive service without addressing the qualifications of the providers and suppliers who are to be paid for furnishing this care under a national program. We are finalizing eligibility criteria for radiologists and imaging facilities for lung cancer screening with modifications based on the evidence reviewed, including public comments, in light of some of the added risks of this particular procedure (for example, exposure to radiation even at low doses creates a patient safety concern). Using the NCD process, we have asked for and received public comments about those criteria. We have made some changes to those criteria as a result of the public comments. We believe our actions are consistent with our authority under the Medicare statute and do not interfere with State licensing determinations. VIII. Analysis National coverage determinations (NCDs) are determinations by the Secretary with respect to whether or not a particular item or service is covered nationally under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (\u00a7 1869(f)(1)(B)). In order to be covered by Medicare, an item or service must fall within one or more benefit categories contained within Part A or Part B, and must not be otherwise excluded from coverage. Since January 1, 2009, CMS is authorized to cover \"additional preventive services\" (see Section III above) if certain statutory requirements are met as provided under \u00a7 1861(ddd) of the Social Security Act. Regulations at 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.64 provide: (a) Medicare Part B pays for additional preventive services not described in paragraph (1) or (3) of the definition of \"preventive services\" under \u00a7410.2, that identify medical conditions or risk factors for individuals if the Secretary determines through the national coverage determination process (as defined in section 1869(f)(1)(B) of the Act) that these services are all of the following: Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 50 of 97 (1) Reasonable and necessary for the prevention or early detection of illness or disability. (2) Recommended with a grade of A or B by the United States Preventive Services Task Force. (3) Appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under part A or enrolled under Part B. (b) In making determinations under paragraph (a) of this section regarding the coverage of a new preventive service, the Secretary may conduct an assessment of the relation between predicted outcomes and the expenditures for such services and may take into account the results of such an assessment in making such national coverage determinations. Question 1: Is the evidence sufficient to determine that screening for lung cancer with low dose computed tomography is recommended with a grade of A or B by the United States Preventive Services Task Force? In 2014, Moyer and colleagues, on behalf of the USPSTF, reported: \"The USPSTF recommends annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography in adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Screening should be discontinued once a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery. (B recommendation)\" (Moyer, 2014). The evidence is sufficient to conclude that lung cancer screening with LDCT is recommended with a grade B by the USPSTF. Prior to the current recommendation, the USPSTF evaluated lung cancer screening in 1996 (grade D) and in 2004 (grade I - consistent with current I statement) based upon 6 observational studies (Humphrey, 2004). The change in recommendation was based upon four trials (DANTE, DLSCT, MILD, NLST) (Humphrey, 2011). Net benefit of screening was supported primarily by the NLST (for individuals aged 55 to 74 years who have 30 pack-year smoking histories and current smokers or have quit in the past 15 years). Extension of the upper age beyond NLST data was based upon modeling only, with no empirical data. In the 2014 considerations, the USPSTF specifically noted recommendations for: \"Implementation of a Lung Cancer Screening Program Screening Eligibility, Screening Intervals, and Starting and Stopping Ages Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 51 of 97 The NLST, the largest RCT to date with more than 50,000 patients, enrolled participants aged 55 to 74 years at the time of randomization who had a tobacco use history of at least 30 pack-years and were current smokers or had quit within the past 15 years. The USPSTF recommends extending the program used in the NLST through age 80 years. Screening should be discontinued once the person has not smoked for 15 years. The NLST enrolled generally healthy persons, and the findings may not accurately reflect the balance of benefits and harms in those with comorbid conditions. The USPSTF recommends discontinuing screening if a person develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery. Clinicians will encounter patients who are interested in screening but do not meet the criteria of high risk for lung cancer as described previously. The balance of benefits and harms of screening may be unfavorable in these lower-risk patients. Current evidence is lacking on the net benefit of expanding LDCT screening to include lower- risk patients. It is important that persons who are at lower risk for lung cancer be aware of the potential harms of screening. Future improvements in risk assessment tools will help clinicians better individualize patients' risks. Smoking Cessation Counseling All persons enrolled in a screening program should receive smoking cessation interventions. To be consistent with the USPSTF recommendation on counseling and interventions to prevent tobacco use and tobacco-caused disease, persons who are referred to a lung cancer screening program through primary care should receive these interventions before referral. Because many persons may enter screening through pathways besides referral from primary care, the USPSTF encourages incorporating such interventions into the screening program. Shared Decision Making Shared decision making is important for persons within the population for whom screening is recommended. The benefit of screening varies with risk because persons who are at higher risk because of smoking history or other risk factors are more likely to benefit. Screening cannot prevent most lung cancer deaths, and smoking cessation remains essential. Lung cancer screening has substantial harms, most notably the risk for false-positive results and incidental findings that lead to a cascade of testing and treatment that may result in more harms, including the anxiety of living with a lesion that may be cancer. Overdiagnosis of lung cancer and the risks of radiation are real harms, although their magnitude is uncertain. The decision to begin screening should be the result of a Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 52 of 97 thorough discussion of the possible benefits, limitations, and known and uncertain harms. Standardization of LDCT Screening and Follow-Up of Abnormal Findings The evidence for the effectiveness of screening for lung cancer with LDCT comes from RCTs done in large academic medical centers with expertise in using LDCT and diagnosing and managing abnormal lung lesions. Clinical settings that have high rates of diagnostic accuracy using LDCT, appropriate follow-up protocols for positive results, and clear criteria for doing invasive procedures are more likely to duplicate the results found in trials. The USPSTF supports adherence to quality standards for LDCT and establishing protocols to follow up abnormal results, such as those proposed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). A mechanism should be implemented to ensure adherence to these standards. In the context of substantial uncertainty about how best to manage individual lesions, as well as the magnitude of some of the harms of screening, the USPSTF encourages the development of a registry to ensure that appropriate data are collected from screening programs to foster continuous improvement over time. The registry should also compile data on incidental findings and the testing and interventions that occur as a result of these findings.\" Question 2: Is the evidence sufficient to determine that screening for lung cancer with low dose computed tomography is reasonable and necessary for the prevention or early detection of illness or disability? Since 2004, four trials (DANTE, DLSCT, MILD, NLST) evaluated lung cancer screening using LDCT. One large trial (NLST, 2011; n = 53,454) showed three annual LDCT screenings of individuals aged 55 to 74 years, who have 30 pack-year smoking history, and are current smokers or have quit in the past 15 years, reduced lung cancer mortality. Two smaller trials (DANTE, 2009, n = 2472; DLSCT, 2012, n = 4104) did not find a significant difference in lung cancer mortality between LDCT screening compared to control (no screening). One trial compared annual to biennial screening and found no significant difference in lung cancer mortality (MILD, 2012, n = 4099). The NLST is the only trial to demonstrate benefit of lung cancer screening with LDCT. It was a well conducted, large multicenter trial performed at 33 centers with trained and approved radiologists and follow-up evaluation at experienced centers. Investigators noted: \"the NLST was conducted at a variety of medical institutions, many of which are recognized for their expertise in radiology and in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. It is possible that community facilities will be less prepared to undertake screening programs and the medical care that must be associated with them.\" Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 53 of 97 DANTE and DLSCT evaluated participants who were similar in age of those studied in the NLST, but had a smaller smoking history 20 pack-year and compared to no screening. The MILD trial had methodologic issues which reduced study quality in comparison to the other included trials. In past trials, the benefits, mainly in lung cancer mortality, have been difficult to demonstrate due to a number of potential factors including patient selection, along with diagnosis and treatment following positive findings. The NLST demonstrated benefit by enrolling a large number of high exposure patients (smoking history) to be followed for several years to detect a significant decrease (247 deaths from lung cancer per 100,000 person- years in the low-dose CT group and 309 deaths per 100,000 person-years in the radiography group; number needed to screen (NNS) to prevent one lung cancer death = 320). The trial was ended early after an interim analysis. The decision to compare to screening with chest radiology (Church, 1990) was made before the PLCO trial was completed that showed chest radiology did not reduce lung cancer mortality (Oken, 2011); however, the radiology group was exposed to harms that may not have occurred in a no screening control, potentially enhancing the relative benefits and the likelihood of a positive trial result. The harms of LDCT relate to the CT scan itself and the follow-up diagnostic tests or interventions (adverse events from bronchoscopies and biopsies), and patient psychosocial consequences, and have been recognized for many years as noted in past USPSTF reviews. For example, death within 60 days after most invasive diagnostic procedures was twice as high in the radiology group compared to the LDCT group (2.1 % versus 1.0 %; NLST, 2011), which with a large sample size may result in a meaningful difference. NLST investigators wrote: \"one of the most important factors determining the success of screening will be the mortality associated with surgical resection, which was much lower in the NLST than has been reported previously in the general U.S. population (1 % vs. 4 %).\" If this is not maintained with broad implementation of screening, the screening benefits may not be realized. A better understanding of why patients screened with LDCT had lower mortality from invasive procedures is needed. Questions such as whether the state of disease, patient, physician, or bias of either the physician/practitioner or patient may need to be considered. While age inclusion criteria were comparable among trials, the majority of participants were in the 50-64 year age range. In the NLST, 26.6 percent (7110/26,722) of the individuals in the LDCT screening group were 65 years of age or older. Pinsky et al. (2014) noted: \"NLST participants aged 65 years or older had a higher rate of false-positive screening results than those younger than 65 years by a higher cancer prevalence and PPV\" [positive predictive value]. The NLST enrolled patients aged 55 to 74 and followed each of these participants at least 3 years. Therefore, we have data up to age 77 for some participants that entered the NLST at age 74. We had proposed an age range based on the NLST inclusion criteria but will extend the upper age to 77 years based on actual trial data. There are no trial data or evidence on adults over 77 years. Modeling was used to extend the age limit for the USPSTF recommendation. However, results from modeling vary widely based on the assumptions used in the modeling. de Koning et al. specifically reported that \"models assumed 100 % adherence with screening,\" an unrealistic long term assumption for real world screening that even the NLST could not achieve (95 % adherence with three annual screens in LDCT group of NLST). The authors also noted that \"extrapolations beyond those trials' [NLST, PLCO] time horizons, screening intervals, and eligibility criteria introduce uncertainty\" (de Koning, 2014). It is difficult to interpret modeling of benefits and harms since models may be limited in consideration of older patients if inputs are based solely on data from younger populations. Patz et al. (2014) noted: \"[a]s with any model, one should be cautious in extrapolating much beyond the data on which the model was based, which in this case are 3 annual screens and a total of approximately 7 years of follow-up.\" Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 54 of 97 Age (inclusion criterion)Smoking history (inclusion criterion)Positive result LDCT (false positive rate) DANTE; n = 2472 (Infante, 2009) mean age = 64.6; nodule 4 %) It is recognized that the number and severity of comorbidities increases with age (Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, 2011). Comorbidities may then influence the ability to tolerate invasive diagnostic procedures (e.g., risk for adverse events from bronchoscopy; Hehn, 2003) and may reduce the response of cancer treatments in older adults with multiple comorbidities. Wang and colleagues (2012) noted: \"[c]omorbidity can have an impact on care for patients with NSCLC [non-small-cell lung cancer] in a variety of ways. First, patients with comorbidity are more likely to experience treatment toxicity, and treatments may exacerbate underlying comorbidity. Second, comorbidity decreases the likelihood of completing treatment. In a large trial (Frasci et al., 2000) patients with advanced NSCLC who had Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) scores 2 were more likely to discontinue chemotherapy. Third, significant comorbidities can limit life expectancy, particularly in earlier-stage cancers, decreasing the potential survival benefit of cancer treatment.\" Given these concerns without actual trial data to show that the benefits outweigh the harms, and the harms (e.g., mortality and morbidity from invasive procedures as biopsies) may be significant, the evidence is insufficient to determine that screening is reasonable and necessary for beneficiaries 78 years of age and older. Smoking history is an important variable to consider since higher exposure increases risk; however, it is a difficult variable to accurately ascertain in general clinical practice due to recall or approximations since it is typically self- reported. A specific formal determination of smoking history is needed. Lung cancer screening outcomes may very well hinge on the initial determination. The NLST included individuals with 30 pack-year (mean = 56) smoking history while DANTE and DLSCT enrolled individuals with 20 pack-year smoking history. Over- diagnosis, the detection of indolent tumors that otherwise may not cause clinical symptoms [\"more than 18 % of all lung cancers detected by LDCT in the NLST seem to be indolent\" (Patz, 2014)], also influences the balance of benefits and harms of screening. The false positive rate of LDCT positive screens was very high in all three trials (DANTE, DLSCT, and NLST). While progress has been made in limiting harms, especially radiation exposure, per screening scan, which was limited to an average of 1.5 mSv in the NLST, many individuals have follow-up chest CTs (LDCT or standard diagnostic CT in 49.8 percent in NLST LDCT group) or PET-CT scans (8.3 percent in NLST LDCT group; radiation dose of typical PET is greater than or equal to standard diagnostic CT). Accordingly, the low dose designation may be misleading in the sense that it may not reflect the total radiation exposure from screening for some Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 55 of 97 individuals. Women comprised 45 percent of the study population in DLSCT and 41 percent in NLST. Gender was borderline as an interaction in NLST (p = 0.08; Pinsky, 2013). DANTE enrolled only men but gender alone is unlikely to account for all of the observed differences between the trials. Other patient and provider characteristics, nodule size and evaluation, sample size and control group interventions were likely factors. The high LDCT screening false positive rate for lung cancer in these trials and the subsequent need for follow-up of small lesions are concerning. It is difficult to estimate the full extent that additional testing at community centers, and the false positive rate, will have in the Medicare population, along with the potential harms of subsequent evaluation in beneficiaries with advanced age and comorbidities. Overall, based primarily on the results of the NLST, we find that the evidence is sufficient to determine that screening for lung cancer with LDCT is reasonable and necessary for the prevention or early detection of illness or disability for the exact population studied in the NLST. This recommended screening population is consistent with recommendations and guidelines from major organizations such as the American Cancer Society, American Lung Association, and the American College of Chest Physicians. The American College of Radiology recommends the broader group, similar to the USPSTF recommendation while the American Academy of Family Physicians found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening. There are substantial concerns that the benefits demonstrated in NLST may not be replicated with broad screening in the Medicare population. The National Cancer Institute which sponsored the NLST noted: \"Questions will still remain about whether the balance of benefits and harms found in a study conducted by centres that have strong expertise in screening can be maintained in less regulated and less quality-controlled settings in the general community\" (Kramer, 2011). While recognizing the importance of the NLST, the MEDCAC reinforced these concerns according to the committee's low confidence (2.22 out of 5 scale) that the benefits outweigh the harms of lung cancer screening with LDCT in the Medicare population (http://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage- database/details/medcac-meeting-details.aspx?MEDCACId=68) Marshall et al. (2013) noted: \"[g]eneralization of findings from tightly controlled trial situations to large-scale mass screening programs require uniform standards and high quality control in order to be able to accurately track and assess nodules over time. Lung cancer screening is more than simple provision of a CT service; it is as a long-term commitment requiring extensive infrastructure to allow for invitation and recruitment; quality improvement; workforce/facility capacity for screening, diagnosis and treatment; health professional training; participant information and support. On-going evaluation and monitoring of the program is essential to ensure high standards of care are met and delivered in a consistent and acceptable way.\" Comments submitted to the USPSTF expressed similar concerns. The USPSTF responded by adding a section on implementation \"emphasizing the need for monitoring this implementation, quality assurance in diagnostic imaging, and appropriate follow-up to replicate the benefits observed in the NLST in the general population.\" This programmatic approach and implementation framework provide the foundation for our decision and enables LDCT lung cancer screening to be reasonable and necessary. Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 56 of 97 Since the NLST was the only trial of several trials and observational studies over the past decade to show benefits, there is no evidence of improvements in health outcomes from lung cancer screening using LDCT in other populations. The results of ongoing trials in Europe will help solidify the evidence base (Field, 2013). There is no evidence on LDCT lung cancer screening in adults over 75 years of age since no trial has included this subgroup. There is no evidence on screening with more than 3 annual LDCT scans. While modeling, if performed properly with evidence based assumptions, may generate interesting hypotheses, direct evidence from actual studies designed to test hypotheses are still needed. Sox (2014) recently wrote: \"No one wants to repeat the experience with prostate cancer screening, which became a de facto standard of practice long before evidence from randomized trials signaled caution. The era of lung cancer screening begins with randomized trial evidence, but the potential for uncontrolled growth - and net harm - remains. If Medicare covers lung cancer screening, it must require routine reporting of recruitment, screening, diagnosis, and treatment of lung cancer from every screening site. The findings will help patients decide about screening, set benchmarks for evaluating programs, and inform policy about screening.\" The Veterans Health Administration is also implementing screening with data collection which will help \"assess whether the predominantly older, male VHA population with several chronic conditions has different outcomes with screening from those of the younger, healthier NLST population\" (Kinsinger, 2014). With concerns and limitations, we find that the evidence is sufficient to conclude that lung cancer screening is reasonable and necessary for prevention or early detection of illness or disability, for Medicare beneficiaries under constraints similar to the NLST protocol, with specific eligibility requirements, performed by radiologists with specific LDCT training, and performed at qualified centers where specific data are collected. We note that LDCT screening has never been tested broadly in community settings or implemented on a widespread scale. Consistent with the USPSTF grade B recommendation, this programmatic approach and implementation framework allows LDCT lung cancer screening to be reasonable and necessary for Medicare beneficiaries. This approach was supported by evidence-based guidelines developed by multi-society multi-disciplinary stakeholders (Mazzone, 2014), and the two requestors of this national coverage determination. During the second comment period we received 133 comments, of which a large majority supported the framework of our proposed national coverage determination. Specific coverage criteria and other requirements have been adjusted accordingly in this final national coverage determination based on the evidence reviewed, including clarifications of published data and professional medical society position statements. Question 3: Is the evidence sufficient to determine that screening for lung cancer with low dose computed tomography is appropriate for Medicare beneficiaries? Lung cancer is a burdensome condition for the Medicare population due to the advanced stage and age at diagnosis and at death. Early detection with various screening tests has been studied for many years without positive results until the NLST. Based on the results of the NLST, lung cancer screening using LDCT was shown to reduce lung cancer mortality compared to screening with chest radiogram (x-ray) for a very defined screening population including a portion of the Medicare population. Since no other lung cancer screening test has been proven, there is no gold standard comparator to calculate sensitivity or specificity. Autopsy studies have not been published but may provide additional information in the future. The LDCT scan is relatively simple and attempts to balance radiation exposure to acceptable image quality, compared to standard diagnostic chest CT scans that are not appropriate for screening. Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 57 of 97 Medicare Beneficiary Eligibility As noted above, the positive evidence for lung cancer screening with LDCT is from the NLST, with inclusion criteria limited to individuals aged 55 to 74 years who have 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit smoking within the past 15 years. Many commenters asked for a reassessment of the age range for screening. Our proposed age range was set to match the enrollment age criterion of NLST. As these participants continued with the three annual screenings, however, benefit and harms data were actually recorded on participants up to and including the age of 77 years. In age specific analysis (Pinsky, 2014), no statistically significant increase in harms was reported. Data on these patients were analyzed along with the other trial participants to demonstrate overall benefits. Actual data from a well conducted randomized controlled trial provides the strongest form of evidence. From the NLST, CMS finds sufficient evidence to support an expansion of appropriate LDCT screening for eligible beneficiaries 55 to 77 years of age. There are no data and no evidence to show improvements in health outcomes or that benefits outweigh harms, in smokers 78 years and older. Uncertain results from modeling based on unrealistic assumptions are insufficient. Based on the evidence from the NLST, lung cancer screening with LDCT is only appropriate for Medicare beneficiaries as defined by the NLST and provided in a screening program. Smoking History and Pack-Year Calculation Smoking history is an important criterion for lung cancer screening using LDCT but is subject to must ascertain smoking history accurately, taking into consideration intermittent periods of not smoking or reduced amounts, to ensure optimal screening outcomes. One pack-year is equal to one pack of 20 cigarettes smoked each and every day for one year (Prignot, 1987). Counseling and Shared Decision Making Lung cancer screening with LDCT is a complex topic as noted above. Additionally, as discussed by Mazzone and colleages (2014) regarding who is offered lung cancer screening: \"The principal question is how do lung cancer Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 58 of 97 1.

Counseling on the importance of maintaining cigarette smoking abstinence if former smoker, or beginning/continuing tobacco use cessation if current smoker, and furnishing of information about tobacco cessation interventions. 5. If appropriate, the furnishing of a written order for lung cancer screening with LDCT that includes: the beneficiary's date of birth; current smoking status, actual pack-year smoking history (number); if former smoker, the number of years since quitting smoking; a statement that the beneficiary is asymptomatic (no signs or symptoms of lung cancer); and NPI of the ordering practitioner. 1. Explicitly state the decision that needs to be considered; 2. Provide evidence-based information about a health condition, the options, associated benefits, harms, probabilities, and scientific uncertainties;screening programs identify a group at high enough risk of developing lung cancer to benefit more than they are harmed. The balance with this choice is that more lives can be saved by screening at lower thresholds of risk, but the relative harms of screening increase as the threshold is lowered. It is difficult to determine the ideal balance of benefit and harm as the value of the benefit and harms is not equal, and varies with patient preferences.\" Due to the complex factors involved in deciding whether to start a lung cancer screening program, formal shared decision making between the physician or non-physician practitioner and beneficiary is important. Eligible beneficiaries should be aware of, among other things, the individual commitment needed to gain benefits from a lung cancer screening program. Barry and Edgman-Levitan (2012) noted: \"[t]he process by which the optimal decision may be reached for a patient at a fateful health crossroads is called shared decision making and involves, at minimum, a clinician and the patient, although other members of the health care team or friends and family members may be invited to participate. In shared decision making, both parties share information: the clinician offers options and describes their risks and benefits, and the patient expresses his or her preferences and values. Each participant is thus armed with a better understanding of the relevant factors and shares responsibility in the decision about how to proceed. (Charles, 1997)\" Due to the specific patient selection criteria, benefits, harms, and adherence, along with the need for shared decision making, we believe that the lung cancer LDCT screening benefit should include a specific counseling and shared decision making visit that addresses the following: Decision aids may assist in this process. In a Cochrane Review, Stacey et al., noted \"[a]ccording to the International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration, decision aids are evidence-based tools designed to help patients to participate in making specific and deliberated choices among healthcare options. Patient decision aids supplement (rather than replace) clinicians' counselling about options. The specific aims of decision aids and the type of decision support they provide may vary slightly, but in general they: Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 59 of 97 3. Help patients to recognize the values-sensitive nature of the decision and to clarify, either implicitly or explicitly, the value they place on the benefits, harms, and scientific uncertainties. (To accomplish this, patient decision aids may describe the options in enough detail that clients can imagine what it is like to experience the physical, emotional, and social effects and/or guide clients to consider which benefits and harms are most important to them).\" As part of the counseling and shared decision making visit, we are requiring that, among other things, shared decision making (including the use of one or more decision aids) includes information on benefits, harms, follow- up diagnostic testing, over-diagnosis, false positive rate and total radiation exposure. We believe that specific decision aids for lung cancer screening are being developed and will become more readily available as screening is more broadly adopted. While we are not requiring the use of a specific decision aid under this NCD, we note that the National Institutes of Health's National Cancer Institute has developed a decision aid/tool, which is available at: http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/qa/2002/NLSTstudyGuidePatientsPhysicians. Reading Radiologist Training Specific training and experience in performing LDCT screening and in interpreting results are important. The NLST had specific requirements for participating radiologists. Donnelly noted: \"[l]ung cancer screening computed tomographies (CTs) differ from traditional chest CT scans in that they are performed at very low radiation doses, which allow the detection of small nodules but which have a much higher noise content that would not be acceptable in a diagnostic chest CT. The technical parameters require a great deal of attention on the part of the user, because inappropriate settings could result in either excess radiation dose to the large population of screened individuals or in low-quality images with impaired nodule detectability. Both situations undermine the main goal of the screening program, which is to detect lung nodules using as low a radiation dose as can reasonably be achieved. Once an image has been obtained, there are unique interpretive issues that must be addressed mainly because of the very high noise content of the images and the high prevalence of incidental findings in the chest unrelated to the sought-after pulmonary nodules.\" To ensure that benefits outweigh the harms, specific furnishing and interpreting radiologist training is needed, consistent with the NLST. \"Approval for NLST also required review of a dedicated NLST training set, created by a subgroup of radiologists, which described acceptable CT and chest radiographic acquisition parameters and image quality requirements, and provided examples of various focal lung opacities with corresponding interpretations to promote a uniform knowledge base across sites.\" (NLST, Radiology 2011) \"Radiologist qualifications required certification by the American Board of Radiology or equivalent, documented training in diagnostic radiology and radiation safety, involvement in the supervision and interpretation of at least 300 chest CT acquisitions in the past 3 years and at least 200 chest radiographic acquisitions per year, and participation in continuing medical education in accordance with the American College of Radiology standard. Approval for NLST also required review of a dedicated NLST training set, created by a subgroup of radiologists, which described acceptable CT and chest radiographic acquisition parameters and image quality requirements, and provided examples of various focal lung opacities with corresponding interpretations to promote a uniform knowledge base across sites.\" (NLST, Radiology 2011. Supplemental Materials) The American College of Radiology requires for CT accreditation board certification in radiology or diagnostic radiology or for radiologists that are not board certified \"interpretation and reporting of 500 CT examinations in Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 60 of 97 the past 36 months' and other medical education (http://www.acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/Accreditation/CT/Requirements.pdf). To be an ACR Designated Lung Cancer Screening Center, the radiologist must have experience of interpreting \"200 chest CT cases in prior 36 months:\" (http://www.acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/PDF/QualitySafety/Lung%20Screening/Lung%20Cancer%20Scree ning%20Center%20Attestation%20Form.pdf). Radiation Dose An important aspect of LDCT screening is reducing radiation exposure to as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA; see http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/alara.html), especially given the annual screening frequency and likely follow-up diagnostic imaging tests. Donnelly noted: [i]n general, lower radiation doses can be achieved by using lower tube currents and lower tube voltages. The current-time product (mAs) can be considered as the number of x-rays that enter the patient. Use of fewer x-rays (lower mAs) results in a lower radiation dose to the patient but in a higher noise content to the image. Typical tube current-time product values for diagnostic studies vary greatly depending upon the institution, patient size, and other scanning parameters; however, these values are often in the 200 to 250 mAs range for an average-sized patient. In the NLST study, screening lung cancer CT scans were typically performed at 20 to 40 mAs.\" \"Although the acquisition parameters for low-dose CT are not explicitly defined in the imaging community, each of the scanners used in NLST was individually tested by using a CT dose index phantom and patient data to achieve comparable subjective image quality by using tube current-time products of 40 mAs or lower for the average-sized patient. Depending on the scanner, the effective tube current-time product (tube current-time products/scan pitch) range varied from 20 to 30 mAs for an average sized patient. It is estimated that each NLST low-dose CT resulted in an average effective dose of 1.5 mSv, whereas the effective dose from conventional chest CT varies considerably in clinical practice but is on the order of 8 mSv.\" (NLST, 2011 Radiology; Cody, 2010) We received comments suggesting that the radiation dose should be as low as possible, and that CMS should allow for adjustments based on the size of the individual, along with suggesting that milligray (mGy) is a more common measurement than millisievert (mSv) for expressing volumetric dose. Based on the comments received and the evidence reviewed, including recently published multi-society, multi-disciplinary evidence-based recommendations (Kazerooni et al., 2014), we believe that LDCT with a volumetric CT dose index (CTDIvol) of 3.0 mGy (milligray) for standard size patients (defined to be 5' 7\" tall; and approximately 155 pounds) with appropriate reductions in CTDIvol for smaller patients and appropriate increases in CTDIvol for larger patients, is appropriate for this Medicare benefit. LDCT Lung Cancer Screening Imaging Facilities Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 61 of 97 Performs LDCT with volumetric CT dose index (CTDIvol) of 3.0 mGy (milligray) for standard size patients (defined to be 5' 7\" and approximately 155 pounds) with appropriate reductions in CTDIvol for smaller patients and appropriate increases in CTDIvol for larger patients; Utilizes a standardized lung nodule identification, classification, and reporting system; Makes available smoking cessation interventions for current smokers; andOver the past few months, multi-society multi-disciplinary stakeholders, including major professional medical societies and NLST investigators, have worked collaboratively and intently to develop evidence-based recommendations on the necessary components of a high quality lung cancer screening program. Two recent published articles present guidance from these major stakeholders. Kazerooni et al. (2014) published the recommendations of the American College of Radiology with support in public comments from the Lung Cancer Alliance and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Mazzone et al. (2014) published recommendations from multispecialty stakeholders including the American College of Chest Physicians, American Thoracic Society, American Association of Thoracic Surgery, American Cancer Society and the American Society of Preventive Oncology. These evidence-based recommendations describe components that are necessary for high quality LDCT lung cancer screening programs. As reported, these components are: Component 1: Who is offered LDCT lung cancer screening; Component 2: How often, and for how long, to screen; Component 3: How the CT is performed; Component 4: Lung nodule identification; Component 5: reporting; 6: algorithms; Component 7: Component 8: Patient and provider education; Component 9: Data collection. Based on these recently published evidence-based recommendations, CMS strongly encourages eligible facilities to implement the necessary components of a high quality LDCT lung cancer screening program as recommended by multi-society stakeholders. In addition, we support the development of a multi-society, multi-disciplinary governance body to continue to refine and optimize screening practices over time. CMS would gladly participate. We received feedback from commenters regarding the proposed imaging facility eligibility criteria. While we agree with some of the commenters that requiring past participation in the NLST or advanced diagnostic imaging center accreditation with experience in LDCT lung cancer screening would place an undue burden on imaging facilities, we also agree with the commenters who expressed concern that without quality requirements, beneficiaries could be exposed to additional harms. Based on the evidence reviewed, in response to the public comments, and to ensure appropriate access to these services, we have modified the imaging facility eligibility criteria. We believe these revised imaging facility eligibility requirements strike an appropriate balance between maintaining appropriate and high quality access to these services, while reducing burden. For purposes of Medicare coverage of lung cancer screening with LDCT, an eligible imaging facility is one that: Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 62 of 97 Collects and submits data as described in this NCD to a CMS-approved national registry for each LDCT lung cancer screening performed. Data Type Minimum Required Data Elements Facility Identifier Radiologist (reading) National Provider Identifier (NPI) Patient Identifier Ordering Practitioner National Provider Identifier (NPI) CT scanner Manufacturer, ModelLDCT Lung Cancer Screening Registry The primary purpose for requiring the submission of data to the registry is to document compliance with the coverage criteria that are not evidenced on the health care claim. Furthermore, based on the public comments and the evidence reviewed, we strongly believe that the registry will serve as an aid to those seeking to study the clinical benefits of this screening. The registry and the other criteria required in this NCD are supported by the evidence reviewed, including the NLST. The registry will help ensure that only eligible beneficiaries will receive this screening service since only beneficiaries that meet the eligibility requirements will benefit from such screening. Furthermore, we recognize the impact of this criterion for imaging facilities. We will only require production of the minimum number of data elements to carry out this payment function in an effort to reduce burdens. Therefore, we are modifying the data registry elements, based on our review of the evidence and feedback received from commenters. As amended, the data elements are limited to those required to determine whether an individual has met the coverage criteria for the LDCT lung cancer screening service, that is, whether their receipt of the service was \"reasonable and necessary\" and \"appropriate.\" Data collected and submitted to a CMS- approved national registry must include, at minimum, all of the following elements: Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 63 of 97 Data Type Minimum Required Data Elements Indication Lung cancer LDCT screening - absence of signs or symptoms of lung cancer System Lung nodule identification, classification and reporting system Smoking history Current status (current, former, never), If former smoker, years since quitting, Pack-years as reported by the ordering practitioner, For current smokers, smoking cessation interventions available. Effective radiation dose CT Dose Index (CTDIvol) Screening Screen date Initial Screen or Subsequent Screen Additionally, national registries are strongly encouraged to collect data on lung nodules (for example: clinically significant non-lung cancer findings, the number and types of nodules, and size and location of each nodule), subsequent diagnostic testing, adverse events, and intermediate and long term health outcomes, in order to inform practices and policymakers about the ability to implement a LDCT lung cancer screening program broadly in multiple settings across the country, and achieve positive outcomes, consistent with the NLST. We recognize that these other data elements are extremely important to establishing the benefit of these screening services and improvement in health outcomes. We strongly encourage submission of such data elements to registries in addition to the minimum elements required under this NCD. These data will not only verify that screening leads to improved health outcomes for the Medicare population, but will also serve as the basis to refine and improve screening in practice, and serve the quality improvement purposes of screening facilities. We believe that multi- society stakeholders are in the best position to determine the appropriate data elements for reaching these goals, and to adjust the particular elements over time. All CMS-approved registries must have the capacity and capability to collect data from any Medicare-eligible imaging facility/department that furnishes lung cancer screening with LDCT, with a catchment area that includes all 50 States, United States Territories, and the District of Columbia.

Adherence to Screening, Interval and Cumulative Screens The NLST evaluated three annual LDCT screenings. DANTE and DLSCT evaluated five annual screenings. There is some consistency in the annual interval of screening studied in trials although there is little evidence to support an annual screen versus every two years or other interval. Results of ongoing trials in Europe may provide additional data in the future (Field, 2013). While the total number of annual screenings in these trials was likely influenced by trial logistics and funding, in addition to clinical considerations, the frequency and duration are important factors in adherence to a screening program over time. Adherence to screening protocols and programs is important to continually detect nodules over the study period. Adherence in the NLST was very high for all three screenings - \"95 % in the low-dose CT group and 93 % in the radiography group\" (NLST, 2011). If adherence is lower in general practice outside the clinical trial settings, the benefits of lung cancer screening, as demonstrated in the NLST, may be diminished. Smoking Cessation Since \"[s]moking is widely recognized as the leading cause of lung cancer\" (NCI - http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/lungb.html), smoking cessation interventions were integral interventions in published trials. According to the 2011 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), 14 percent of beneficiaries reported to be current smokers, and 44 percent reported as former smokers, although pack-year information is not collected. Additionally, we received public comments that also addressed tobacco cessation interventions. Therefore, based on the evidence reviewed and public comments received, we are modifying the imaging facility eligibility criteria to require that smoking cessation interventions, such as educational materials, be made Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 65 of 97 available. Additional Considerations Expenditure Assessment As noted in 42 CFR \u00a7 410.64, an assessment of the relation between predicted outcome and the expenditures of an additional preventive service may be conducted and the results of such assessment may be taken into consideration in making a national coverage determination regarding the coverage of a new preventive service. Cost and cost-effectiveness analyses have been conducted and published. McMahon et al. (2011) reported that \"[a]nnual screening of current and former smokers aged 50-74 cost between $126,000-$169,000/QALY (minimum 20 pack-years of smoking) or $110,000-$166,000/QALY (40 pack-year minimum), compared to no screening and assuming background quit rates\" and concluded that \"[t]he cost-effectiveness of CT screening will likely be strongly linked to achievable smoking cessation rates. Trials and further modeling should explore the consequences of relationships between smoking behaviors and screen participation.\" Black et al. (2014) estimated that incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were $52,000 per life-year gained (95 % CI, 34,000 to 106,000). CMS will continue to closely monitor publications on expenditure assessments of lung cancer screening with LDCT. Post Coverage Analysis In addition to the data to be collected to confirm screening eligibility, provider and center requirements, CMS will monitor benefits and harms using administrative and clinical databases such as SEER and/or U.S. Cancer Statistics as necessary to ensure that benefits continue to outweigh harms when lung cancer LDCT screening is implemented broadly outside the controlled trial setting, and when screening data accumulates beyond the three annual screens seen in the NLST. Without continuing outcomes evaluation, there is insufficient evidence to support screening greater than three annual LDCT lung cancer screenings. CMS will evaluate five year data to better establish duration and the cumulative limit in the number of LDCT screens, as well as inform, if appropriate, modifications to Medicare coverage. Disparities Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 66 of 97 Lung cancer incidences are more common in men than women, and highest in African American men. Women comprised 41 percent of the study population in NLST. We note that 90.9 percent of participants in the NLST were white. CMS encourages shared decision making between patients and practitioners, and if appropriate, participation in a lung cancer screening program. Number of New Cases per 100,000 Persons by Race/Ethnicity & Sex: Lung and Bronchus Cancer (SEER 18, 2007- 2011, Age-Adjusted) http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/lungb.html Summary Given the burden of lung cancer on the United States population, a suitable screening test for lung cancer has been sought for many years. Lung cancer screening has been recommended by the USPSTF with a grade B recommendation for certain individuals. Based on our review of the available evidence, including clinical guidelines and public comments, we find that the evidence is sufficient to conclude that lung cancer screening with LDCT is reasonable and necessary for prevention or early detection of illness or disability and appropriate for Medicare beneficiaries under conditions established in this NCD. These conditions are supported by the evidence reviewed, including conditions in the NLST and evidence-based multi-society, multi-disciplinary recommendations. The results of ongoing trials will provide additional evidence. We believe that specific Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 67 of 97 Age 55 - 77 years; Asymptomatic (no signs or symptoms of lung cancer); Tobacco smoking history of at least 30 pack-years (one pack-year = smoking one pack per day for one year; 1 pack = 20 cigarettes); Current smoker or one who has quit smoking within the last 15 years; and Receives a written order for LDCT lung cancer screening that meets the following criteria:beneficiary, practitioner, and imaging facility eligibility requirements are necessary to ensure that benefits of screening outweigh harms in the Medicare population, consistent with the NLST. Lung cancer screening with LDCT has not been implemented broadly in any population to date. While we are establishing coverage for this additional preventive service under Medicare part B, we believe we need to proceed in a responsible manner and will continue to monitor the evidence as stewards of the Medicare program. IX. Conclusion The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has determined that the evidence is sufficient to add a lung cancer screening counseling and shared decision making visit, and for appropriate beneficiaries, annual screening for lung cancer with low dose computed tomography (LDCT), as an additional preventive service benefit under the Medicare program only if all of the following criteria are met: Beneficiary eligibility criteria: Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 68 of 97 For the initial LDCT lung cancer screening service: a beneficiary must receive a written order for LDCT lung cancer screening during a lung cancer screening counseling and shared decision making visit, furnished by a physician (as defined in Section 1861(r)(1) of the Social Security Act) or qualified non-physician practitioner (meaning a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist as defined in \u00a71861(aa)(5) of the Social Security Act). A lung cancer screening counseling and shared decision making visit includes the following elements (and is appropriately documented in the beneficiary's medical records): Determination of beneficiary eligibility including age, absence of signs or symptoms of lung cancer, a specific calculation of cigarette smoking pack-years; and if a former smoker, the number of years since quitting; Shared decision making, including the use of one or more decision aids, to include benefits and harms of screening, follow-up diagnostic testing, over-diagnosis, false positive rate, and total radiation exposure; Counseling on the importance of adherence to annual lung cancer LDCT screening, impact of comorbidities and ability or willingness to undergo diagnosis and treatment; Counseling on the importance of maintaining cigarette smoking abstinence if former smoker; or the importance of smoking cessation if current smoker and, if appropriate, furnishing of information about tobacco cessation interventions; and If appropriate, the furnishing of a written order for lung cancer screening with LDCT. For subsequent LDCT lung cancer screenings: the beneficiary must receive a written order for LDCT lung cancer screening, which may be furnished during any appropriate visit with a physician (as defined in Section 1861(r)(1) of the Social Security Act) or qualified non-physician practitioner (meaning a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist as defined in Section 1861(aa)(5) of the Social Security Act). If a physician or qualified non-physician practitioner elects to provide a lung cancer screening counseling and shared decision making visit for subsequent lung cancer screenings with LDCT, the visit must meet the criteria described above for a counseling and shared decision making visit. Written orders for both initial and subsequent LDCT lung cancer screenings must contain the following information, which must also be appropriately documented in the beneficiary's medical records: Beneficiary date of birth; Actual pack - year smoking history (number); Current smoking status, and for former smokers, the number of years since quitting smoking; Statement that the beneficiary is asymptomatic (no signs or symptoms of lung cancer); and National Provider Identifier (NPI) of the ordering practitioner. Board certification or board eligibility with the American Board of Radiology or equivalent organization; Documented training in diagnostic radiology and radiation safety; Involvement in the supervision and interpretation of at least 300 chest computed tomography acquisitions in the past 3 years; Documented participation in continuing medical education in accordance with current American College of Radiology standards; and Furnish lung cancer screening with LDCT in a radiology imaging facility that meets the radiology imaging facility eligibility criteria below.

The information is subject to formal revisions and formatting changes prior to the release of the final NCD contractor instructions and publication in the Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual. Screening for Lung Cancer with Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) Item/Service Description A. General Lung cancer is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Cancer of the lung and bronchus accounted for over 150,000 deaths in 2013, with a median age at death of 72 years. Computed tomography (CT) is an imaging procedure that uses specialized x-ray equipment to create detailed pictures of areas inside the body. Low dose computed tomography (LDCT) is a chest CT scan performed at settings to minimize radiation exposure compared to a standard chest CT. Under \u00a71861(ddd) of the Social Security Act (the Act), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has the authority to add coverage of additional preventive services if certain statutory requirements are met. The regulations provide: 42 CFR \u00a7 410.64 Additional preventive services (a) Medicare Part B pays for additional preventive services not described in paragraph (1) or (3) of the definition of \"preventive services\" under \u00a7410.2, that identify medical conditions or risk factors for individuals if the Secretary determines through the national coverage determination process (as defined in section 1869(f)(1)(B) of the Act) that these services are all of the following: (1) reasonable and necessary for the prevention or early detection of illness or disability.(2) recommended with a grade of A or B by the United States Preventive Services Task Force, (3) appropriate for individuals entitled to benefits under Part A or enrolled under Part B. (b) In making determinations under paragraph (a) of this section regarding the coverage of a new preventive Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 84 of 97 Age 55 - 77 years; Asymptomatic (no signs or symptoms of lung cancer); Tobacco smoking history of at least 30 pack-years (one pack-year = smoking one pack per day for one year; 1 pack = 20 cigarettes); Current smoker or one who has quit smoking within the last 15 years; and Receives a written order for LDCT lung cancer screening that meets the following criteria: For the initial LDCT lung cancer screening service: a beneficiary must receive a written order for LDCT lung cancer screening during a lung cancer screening counseling and shared decision making visit, furnished by a physician (as defined in Section 1861(r)(1) of the Social Security Act) or qualified non- physician practitioner (meaning a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist as defined in \u00a71861(aa)(5) of the Social Security Act). A lung cancer screening counseling and shared decision making visit includes the following elements (and is appropriately documented in the beneficiary's medical records): service, the Secretary may conduct an assessment of the relation between predicted outcomes and the expenditures for such services and may take into account the results of such an assessment in making such national coverage determinations. The scope of the national coverage analysis evaluated the evidence for screening for lung cancer with LDCT. Diagnostic CTs were outside the scope of the national coverage analysis. Indications and Limitations of Coverage B. Nationally Covered Indications The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has determined that the evidence is sufficient to add a lung cancer screening counseling and shared decision making visit, and for appropriate beneficiaries, annual screening for lung cancer with low dose computed tomography (LDCT), as an additional preventive service benefit under the Medicare program only if all of the following criteria are met: Beneficiary eligibility criteria: Printed on 11/4/2015. Page 85 of 97 Determination of beneficiary eligibility including age, absence of signs or symptoms of lung cancer, a specific calculation of cigarette smoking pack-years; and if a former smoker, the number of years since quitting; Shared decision making, including the use of one or more decision aids, to include benefits and harms of screening, follow-up diagnostic testing, over-diagnosis, false positive rate, and total radiation exposure; Counseling on the importance of adherence to annual lung cancer LDCT screening, impact of comorbidities and ability or willingness to undergo diagnosis and treatment; Counseling on the importance of maintaining cigarette smoking abstinence if former smoker; or the importance of smoking cessation if current smoker and, if appropriate, furnishing of information about tobacco cessation interventions; and If appropriate, the furnishing of a written order for lung cancer screening with LDCT. For subsequent LDCT lung cancer screenings: the beneficiary must receive a written order for LDCT lung cancer screening, which may be furnished during any appropriate visit with a physician (as defined in Section 1861(r)(1) of the Social Security Act) or qualified non-physician practitioner (meaning a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist as defined in Section 1861(aa)(5) of the Social Security Act). If a physician or qualified non-physician practitioner elects to provide a lung cancer screening counseling and shared decision making visit for subsequent lung cancer screenings with LDCT, the visit must meet the criteria described above for a counseling and shared decision making visit. Written orders for both initial and subsequent LDCT lung cancer screenings must contain the following information, which must also be appropriately documented in the beneficiary's medical records: Beneficiary date of birth; Actual pack - year smoking history (number); Current smoking status, and for former smokers, the number of years since quitting smoking; Statement that the beneficiary is asymptomatic (no signs or symptoms of lung cancer); and National Provider Identifier (NPI) of the ordering practitioner. Board certification or board eligibility with the American Board of Radiology or equivalent organization; Documented training in diagnostic radiology and radiation safety; Involvement in the supervision and interpretation of at least 300 chest computed tomography acquisitions in the past 3 years; Documented participation in continuing medical education in accordance with current American College of Radiology standards; and Furnish lung cancer screening with LDCT in a radiology imaging facility that meets the radiology imaging facility eligibility criteria below. Performs LDCT with volumetric CT dose index (CTDIvol) of 3.0 mGy (milligray) for standard size patients (defined to be 5' 7\" and approximately 155 pounds) with appropriate reductions in CTDIvol for smaller patients and appropriate increases in CTDIvol for larger patients; Utilizes a standardized lung nodule identification, classification and reporting system; Makes available smoking cessation interventions for current smokers; and Collects and submits data to a CMS-approved registry for each LDCT lung cancer screening performed. The data collected and submitted to a CMS-approved registry must include, at minimum, all of the following elements: Data Type Minimum Required Data Elements Facility IdentifierReading radiologist eligibility criteria: Radiology imaging facility eligibility criteria: Printed on 11/4/2015.

Page 97 of 97 Section 5.0 New Discussion Items Adjustment Disorder Coding Specification 1 Question : should the coding specification on line 449 ADJUSTMENT DISORDERS be deleted? Should various codes used for early childhood intervention be added to line 449 ? Question source : BHAP, HERC staff , OHA foster care division, provider Issue : at the September, 2015 BHAP meeting, it was brought up that the coding specification on line 449 ADJUSTMENT DISORDERS contained ICD -10 codes that were not included on this line. HSD staff requested that Z63.4 ( Disappearance and death of family member ) be added to line 449 at allow counseling for children in foster care who are removed from their family. On review, HERC staff found that the coding specification, written in ICD -9, is not workable in ICD -10. The ICD -9 V codes referenced in the original co ding specification were required to be secondary codes; the ICD -10 Z codes which were cross -walked from these ICD -9 codes can be used as primary codes. Therefore, requiring these ICD -10 codes to be listed as secondary results in a requirement for improper coding. One of the cross -walked Z codes, Z71.89 ( Other specified counseling ) is on line 449 and needs to be removed as it will result in pairing of this code with counseling CPT codes which is inappropriate. As an Errata, the two referenc ed ICD -10 code s in the coding specification that were missing from line 449 were added to line 449. Line 449 coding specification CD-10-CM codes Z71.89, Other specified counseling, and Z63.4 Disappearance and death of family member are only included in this line when i dentified as secondary diagnoses with a primary diagnosis of F43.8, Other reactions to severe stress. Diagnoses included on line 449 ADJUSTMENT DISORDERS ICD-10 Code Code description F43.2x Adjustment disorder F43.8 Other reactions to severe stress Z63.4 Disappearance and death of family member Z71.89 Other specified counseling Further information from HSD staff: We spoke briefly after the HERC Behavioral Health Subcommittee meeting about the work that OHA is doing to expand services to children b irth through five years old. You asked me to send you some information about codes that the group really needs available for reimbursement in order to meet the goals for mental health services for children 0 -5. Of course, common mental health disorders c an be diagnosed in very young children such as depression and separation anxiety. However, some less specific diagnostic codes are needed for young children for circumstances that because of their age, we would have to wait until they moved into a new dev elopmental stage and their symptoms worsened before they could get the help they need. Aside from the Child Maltreatment and Neglect codes that I know are being moved into the PTSD line (previously 995. Codes), below are the Z codes and \"Other Specified\" codes that are often appropriate for 0 -5 when they may not be specific enough for older clients. Adjustment Disorder Coding Specification 2 F43.8 Other Specified Trauma and Stressor Related Disorder -Bereavement - The intent was to provide therapeutic supports to a child or family when there was a loss or change in primary caregiver. F91-8- Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse Control and Conduct Disorder (Previously Disruptive behavior D/O NOS) Z62.820 - Parent Child Relational Problem Z63.8 - Other Specified Problems related to the primary support g roup From Kevin Burns, Child & Family Therapist My primary concern is the loss of two diagnosis the allow us to serve young children with primarily significant behavioral problems, and the absence of any identified \"adjustment\" reaction. Many of these c hildren do not meet criteria for ADHD, or PTSD, and even when they do, these diagnosis can sometimes be \"heavier\" than necessary for a 2 -3 year old. We frequently see children from dysfunctional family systems, with no direct trauma history associated w ith the child, who are so unregulated with their emotional energy, they are disrupting their family and preschool functioning. The diagnosis of Unspecified Behavioral and Emotional Disorder (F91.9) and Disruptive Behavior Disorder NOS (F98.9), previously listed above the priority list line, are now below the line. These codes can be very useful in providing services to young children using a developmentally appropriate lens to organize their treatment. I encourage the Value -Based Subcommittee to suppor t the States (previously OHA) 2015 -2018 Behavioral Health Strategic Plan that promotes Early Intervention and prevention efforts listed under section 3. I believe having enough 0 -5 focused diagnosis available to work with children and families is importan t so we can limit the # of kids who \"fall through the cracks\" when trying to access appropriate services.

The rationale for moving Buerger's disease to an uncovered line was th at there is no treatment for Buerger's disease other than smoking cessation. However, several CCO's have complained about the loss of coverage with the October 1, 2015 Prioritized List. They are getting requests for wound care and other therapy for Buerge r's disease. Recent reviews on the topic outline various therapies, including amputation, medications, immunotherapy, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Dargon (2012) critically reviewed the literature and concluded that \"Tobacco cessation is the cornerst one of treatment. Other modalities of reducing pain or avoiding amputation have not been as successful.\" Complications of Bue rger's disease such as ulcerations or gangrene could be coded with other diagnosis codes, such as peripheral vascular disease with gangrene. However, this may not be correct coding convention. Treatments on line 240 include amputations, revascularization procedures, bypass grafts, embolectomy, and angioplasty. The evidence for treatment of Buerger's disease finds that revasculariz ation and bypass graft procedures are not successful, mainly due to the lack of good targets as a result of disease. Including Buerger's disease on a covered line would allow coverage of wound care and other supportive care activities as well as office vis its and hospitalization. HERC staff recommendations : 1) Add ICD -10 I73.1 (Buerger's disease) to line 240 LIMB THREATENING VASCULAR DISEASE, INFECTIONS, AND VASCULAR COMPLICATIONS and keep on line 657 CARDIOVASCULAR CONDITIONS WITH NO OR MINIMALLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS OR NO TREATMENT NECESSARY 2) Adopt the following new guideline note GUID ELINE NOTE XXX BUE RGER'S DISEASE Lines 240, 657 Buerger's disease (ICD -10 I73.1) is included on line 240 only when ulceration or gangrene is present. Otherwise, this diagnosis is included on line 657. TI73.1 does not pair on line 240 with revascularizati on procedures , bypass graft procedures, or angioplasty . Basic Data Underlying Clinical Decision-Making in Endovascular Therapy Disease Phong (thromboangiitis obliterans) is a nonatherosclerotic segmental inflammatory disease of small- and medium-sized arteries of the distal extremities of predominantly young male tobacco users. Early symptoms may include episodic pain and coldness in ngers, and late ndings may present as intermittent claudication, skin ulcers, or gangrene requiring eventualamputation. Tobacco cessation is the cornerstone of treatment. Other modalities of reducing pain or avoiding amputation have not been as successful. This review summarizes in tabular form the types of treatment that have been used, including therapeutic angiogenesis. INTRODUCTION Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) is a of small- and medium-sized arteries of thedistal extremities of male tobacco users. 1It was rst described by Felix Von Winiwarter in 1879. In 1908,Leo Buerger published a detailed of 11 amputated limbs. 2Buerger's disease typi- cally affects young male smokers; however, there is an increasing prevalence in women. It is more prev- alent in the Middle East and Far East than in NorthAmerica and Western Europe. Patients may present with early ndings of pain or coldness in the ngers. Later ndings includerest pain, skin ulcers, gangrene, and eventual ampu-tation. The Shionoya clinical diagnostic criteria areas follows: (1) smoking history, (2) onset before the age of 50 years, (3) infrapopliteal arterial occlu- sions, (4) either upper limb involvement or phlebitismigrans, and (5) absence of atherosclerotic risk factors other than smoking. 3A wider subset of major and minor criteria for the diagnosis of Buerger'sdisease, described by Mills and Porter, is listed inTable I. Criteria for diagnosis of Buerger's disease4 Major criteria Onset of distal extremity ischemic symptoms before age 45 years Tobacco use Exclusion of: Proximal embolic source (cardiac, TOS, ASO, aneurysms) Trauma and lesions (entrapment, adventitial cyst) Autoimmune disease Hypercoagulable states AtherosclerosisAtherosclerotic risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) No evidence of arterial disease proximal to popliteal or distal brachial PlethysmographyHistopathology Arteriography involvementInstep claudication TOS, thoracic outlet syndrome; ASO, arteriosclerosis obliterans.1Department of Surgery, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR. 2Division of Vascular Surgery, Oregon Health and Science Univer- sity, Portland, OR.

Landry, MD, MCR, Division of Vascular Surgery, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 South West Sam Jackson Park Road, OP-11, online: January 27, 2012 871Section 6.0 Guidelines Acupuncture Guideline Modifications 1 Question s: 1) Should the requirement for referral be removed from the Acupuncture guidelines for non-maternity indications? 2) Should the limit of 2 visits for hyperemesis and breech presentation be increased? 3) How should the acupuncture guideline be modified to align with the back line changes? Question source : HERC staff Issue : The acupuncture guideline was discussed at the October, 2015 VBBS meeting. At that time, the staff suggestion was to remove the clause \"with referral\" in most of the sections . This was received with some concern by the VBBS, and HERC staff was directed to determine if acupuncturists could use E&M codes and generate diagnoses. There was also concern with removing \"with referral\" for pelvic pain in pregnancy; the general consensus w as that maternity care conditions should continue to require referral. There was also a proposal to remove the current limit of 2 visits for hyperemesis and breech presentation . These restrictions were added initially due to concern for overutilization and the possibility of the acupuncturist being able to teach the patient techniques to use at home. All other indications allow 12 visits, with the exception of depression for which 15 visits are allowed. At the October, 2015 meeting, the VBBS was general ly favorable to this change. It was brought to HERC staff attention at the October meeting that the back pain entries in the acupuncture guideline do not reflect the changes made to the coverage of acupuncture for pain conditions with the reworking of the back lines. The new back lines guideline allows up to 30 visits for a combination of PT, chiropractic, and acupuncture services. The acupuncture guideline should be revised to reflect these changes. Additionally, the back line changes are on hold for a n indefinite period and therefore HERC staff feel that 2 versions of these guidelines should be created, one to be in effect prior to the implementation of the back lines changes and one version to be in effect once the back lines changes are in effect. Since the October, 2015 meeting, HERC staff has received written testimony from Stuart Greenleaf, Lac, which provides support to the removal of the \"by referral\" clause, and additionally requests multiple changes and updates to the guideline. Among the c hanges he recommends are 1) Changing the ICD -10 code listed for migraine. The current code (G43.9) codes only for unspecified migraine. 2) Suggested spelling out all code descriptions to assist PCPs 3) Clarify that some of the entries are for below the funding line diagnoses and therefore not covered 4) Correcting multiple incorrect ICD -10 codes in the back line entries 5) Adding ICD -10 codes for the knee osteoarthritis line Acupuncture Guideline Modifications 2 6) Correct the lumbar spine ICD -10 codes for line 545 as all are incorrect and not currently on the line HERC staff recommendation s: 1) Modify GN92 as shown below [note: 2 versions are s hown, due to delay in new back line implementation] a. Remove requir ement for referral from all but obstetric indications b. Make all coverage uniform at 12 visits , except back conditions c. Correct the diagnosis codes for line 374 d. Include all migraine diagnosis codes for line 415 e. Adding in the ICD -10 code for osteoarthritis of the knee for line 467 f. Correct the lumbar back ICD -10 diagnosis codes for line 545 g. Affirm the changes made to the back pain lines as previously accepted with the back lines reorganization to take effect when the new back line implementation occurs (changes in purple were already approved) For January 1, 2016 Prioritized List , but referencing October 1, 20 15 back line changes due to implementation delay.

Tobacco cessation coverage and prevention 1 Question : Should the guideline on tobacco cessation coverage be modified ? Question source : HERC Staff , Public Health Division Issue : Currently, there is a wide variety in coverage by CCOs and DMAP for tobacco cessation. Some are covering quit attempts once in a lifetime, others are covering more frequently, and prior authorizations are variable. Several years ago, a statewide collaborative developed a plan in Oregon to increase quit attempts and reduce smoking rates, named Helping Benef it Oregon Smokers collaborative . The Public Health Division continues work on this area identifying the services most helpful in improving quit rates and translating the new requirements based on the ACA mandate. The ACA mand ates smoking cessation coverage. However , not all CCOs are currently offering the ACA required level of coverage. Several strategies are evidence -based to assist in smoking cessation , both pharmacologic and behavioral. Pharmacologic strategies counseling , in person and telephonic are all considered effective. And acupuncture and hypnosis have been proposed as beneficial for smoking cessation. A number of public health strategies are evidence based to both prevent initiation of smoking and assist with smoking cessation. Recently, the Tobacco Cessation Services report was released that addressed benefit coverage by the CCOs and FFS. They found that in general just over half of smokers were encouraged by their providers to quit in the last 6 months. All CCOs use prior authorization for at least one of the pharmaceutical products. Some CCOS have done targeted strategies for high risk populations such as incentives, additio nal services, and information for pregnant women who smoke. Two CCOs have tobacco free campuses.

Both nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and bupropion were superior to placebo (odds ratios (OR) 1.84; 95% credible interval (CredI) 1.71 to 1.99, and 1.82; 95% CredI 1.60 to 2.06 respectively). Head -to-head comparisons between bupropion and NRT s howed equal 0.99; 95% CredI 0.86 to 1.13). c. Varenicline increased the odds of quitting compared with placebo (OR 2.88; 95% CredI 2.40 to 3.47). Varenicline of NRT (OR 1.57; 95% CredI 1.29 to 1.91), 95% CredI 1.29 to 1.96). nicotine patch (OR 1.51; 95% CredI 1.22 to 1.87), gum 1.38 to lo zenges; OR 1.42; 95% CredI 1.12 to 1.79), but was not more effective than combination NRT (OR 1.06; 95% CredI 0.75 to 1.48). d. Across the 82 included and excluded bupropion trials, our estimate of six seizures in the bupropion arms versus none in the placebo arms was lower than the expected rate (1:1000), at about 1:1500. SAE meta -analysis of the bupropion studies demonstrated no excess of neuropsychiatric (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.31 to 2.50) or cardiovascular events (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.59). SAE meta - analysi s of 14 varenicline trials found no difference between the varenicline and placebo arms (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.55), and subgroup analyses detected no significant excess of neuropsychiatric events (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.67), or of cardiac events (RR 1.26; 95% CI 0.62 to 2.56). a. Nortriptyline increased the chances of quitting (RR 2.03; 95% CI 1.48 to 2.78). Neither nortriptyline nor bupropion were shown to enhance the effect of NRT compared with NRT alone b. Authors' conclusions NRT, bupropion, vareniclin e and cytisine have been shown to improve the chances of quitting. Combination NRT and varenicline are equally effective as quitting aids. Nortriptyline also improves the chances of quitting. On current evidence, none of the treatments appear to have an incidence of adverse events that would mitigate their use. 2) Hughes 2014, Cochrane review of antidepressants for smoking cessation a. 65 trials of bupropion, 10 trials of nortiptyline b. There was high quality evidence that, when used as the sole pharmacotherapy, bupropion significantly increased long -term cessation (44 trials, N = 13,728, risk ratio [RR] 1.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.49 to 1.76). There was moderate quality evidence, limited by a relatively small number of trials and participants, that nortr iptyline also significantly increased long -term cessation when used as the sole pharmacotherapy (six trials, N = 975, RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.78). There is insufficient evidence that adding bupropion (12 trials, N = 3487, RR 1.9, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.51) or nortriptyline (4 trials, N = 1644, RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.55) to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) provides an additional long -term benefit. c. There is a risk of about 1 in 1000 of seizures associated with bupropion use. Bupropion has been associated wi th suicide risk, but whether this is causal is unclear. Nortriptyline has the potential for serious side -effects, but none have been seen in the few small trials for smoking cessation. Tobacco cessation coverage and prevention 4 d. Authors' conclusions The antidepressants bupropion and nortriptyline ai d long - term smoking cessation. Adverse events with either medication appear to rarely be serious or lead to stopping medication. Evidence suggests that the mode of action of bupropion and nortriptyline is independent of their antidepressant effect and that they are of similar efficacy to nicotine replacement. Reuptake inhibitors (e.g. fluoxetine) nor monoamine oxidase inhibitors aid cessation. 3) Stead 2012 , Cochrane review o f NRT for smoking cessation (not included in packet due to study's length) a. N=150 trials (>50,000 participants) b. The risk ratio (RR) of abstinence for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.60 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53 to 1.68). The pooled RRs for each type were 1.49 (95% CI 1.40 to 1.60, 55 trials) for nicotine gum; 1.64 (95% CI 1.52 to 1.78, 43 trials) for nicotine patch; 1.95 (95% CI 1.61 to 2.36, 6 trials) for oral tablets/lozenges; 1.90 (95% CI 1.36 to 2.67, 4 trials) for nicotine inhaler; and 2.02 (95% CI 1.49 to 2.73, 4 trials) for nicotine nasal spray. One trial of oral spray had an RR of 2.48 (95% CI 1.24 to 4.94). The effects were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. c. Five studies directly compared NRT to a non -nicotine pharmacotherapy, bupropion; there was no evidence of a difference in efficacy (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.18). A combination of NRT and bupropion was more effective than bupropion alone (RR 1.24; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.45, 4 trials). Adverse effects from using NRT are related to the type of product, and include skin irritation from patches and irritation to the inside of the mouth from gum and tablets. There is no evidence that NR T increases the risk of heart attacks. d. Authors' conclusions All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of s uccessfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50 to 70%, regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. 4) White 2014, Cochrane review of acupuncture for smoking cessation a. N=38 studies i. N=3 studies (393 patients) comparing acupuncture to waiting list control ii. N=19 studies (1,588 patients) comparing active acupuncture to sham acupuncture a. Based on three studies, acupuncture was not shown to be more effective than a waiting list control for long -term abstinence, with wide confidence intervals and evidence of heterogeneity (n = 393, risk ratio [RR] 1.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98 to 3.28, I\u00b2 = 57%). Compared with sham acupuncture, the R R for the short -term effect of acupuncture was 1.22 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.38), and for the long -term effect was 1.10 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.40). Acupuncture was less effective than nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). There was no evidence that acupuncture is superi or to psychological interventions in the short - or long - term. b. Moderate quality of evidence of no long term benefit for acupuncture on smoking cessation, although evidence of short term effect Tobacco cessation coverage and prevention 5 c. Authors' conclusions Although pooled estimates suggest possible short -term effects there is no consistent, bias -free evidence that acupuncture, acupressure, or laser therapy have a sustained benefit on smoking cessation for six months or more. However, lack of evidence and methodological problems mean that no firm con clusions can be drawn. 5) Stead 2009, Cochrane review of group therapy for smoking cessation a. N=53 trials b. There was an increase in cessation with the use of a group programme (N = 4375, relative risk (RR) 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.60 to 2.46). There was statistical heterogeneity between trials in the comparison of group programmes with no intervention controls so we did not estimate a pooled effect. We failed to det ect evidence that group therapy was more effective than a similar intensity of individual counselling. There was limited evidence that the addition of group therapy to other forms of treatment, such as advice from a health professional or nicotine replacem ent, produced extra benefit. Programmes which included components for increasing cognitive and behavioural skills were not shown to be more effective than same length or shorter programmes without these components. c. Authors' conclusions Group therapy is bet ter for helping people stop smoking than self help, and other less intensive interventions. There is not enough evidence to evaluate whether groups are more effective, or cost -effective, than intensive individual counselling. There is not enough evidence t o support the use of particular psychological components in a programme beyond the support and skills training normally included. 6) Civljak, 2013, Cochrane review of internet based interventions of smoking cessation a. N= 28 studies with > 45,000 participants b. Results: pooled results from three trials that compared interactive and individually tailored interventions to usual care or written self help detected a statistically significant effect in favour of the intervention (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.78). However all three trials were judged to be at high risk of bias in one domain and high statistical heterogeneity was detected (I\u00b2 = 53%), with no obvious clinical explanation. Pooled results fromtwo studies of an interactive, tailored intervention involving the I nternet and automated phone contacts also detected a significant effect (RR 2.05, 95%CI 1.42 to 2.97, I\u00b2 = 42%). c. Conclusions Results suggest that some Internet -based interventions can assist smoking cessation at six months or longer, particularly those wh ich are interactive and tailored to individuals. However, the trials that compared Internet interventions with usual care or self help did not show consistent effects and were at risk of bias. 7) Community Preventive Services Task Force, 2012 , Syst ematic review of telephonic quit lines a. 72 studies total, 60 of which evaluated proactive counseling b. Economic analysis: based on 27 studies i. Cost -effectiveness of providing quitline counseling and cessation information: median estimate of $2,012 per quality -adjuste d life year (QALY) saved (range of values: $439/QALY to $2,627/QALY; 6 studies) Tobacco cessation coverage and prevention 6 ii. Cost -effectiveness of adding cessation medications to existing quitline services: median estimate $795 per QALY saved (range of values: $272/QALY to $4,110/QALY; 6 studies) iii. Cost-effectiveness of providing a combination of quitline counseling, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and media promotion: $7,813 per QALY saved (1 study) c. Conclusions: quitline services are cost -effective and recommended. 8) USPSTF, 20 15 (non -pregnant adults) a. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to adults who use tob acco. i. GRADE A Recommendation b. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to recommend electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) for tobacco cessation in adults, including pregnant women. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians direct patients who smoke tobacco to other cessation interventions with established effectiveness and safety (previously stated). i. GRADE I Recommendation 9) Barnes, 2010, Cochrane systematic review of RCTs on hypnotherapy for smoking cessation a. 11 RCTs comparing hypno therapy to controls (no treatment, advice, or psychological treatment) b. Results: significant heterogeneity of results c. Conclusions: We have not shown that hypnotherapy has a greater effect on six - month quit rates than other interventions or no treatment. The re is not enough evidence to show whether hypnotherapy could be as effective as counselling treatment. The effects of hypnotherapy on smoking cessation claimed by uncontrolled studies were not confirmed by analysis of randomized controlled trials. Cost effectiveness analysis 1) Richard, 2012 a. Massachusetts Medicaid invested in a comprehensive tobacco program b. Cost benefit analysis to evaluate return on investment c. Program costs included pharmacotherapy, counseling and outreach costs d. Costs per program particip ant: $183 e. Inpatient savings per participant $571 f. ROI: Every $1 in program costs was associated with $3.12 (range $3.00 to $3.25) in medical savings, for a $2.12 (range $2.00 to $2.25) return on investment to the Medicaid program for every dollar spent. ACA requirements (as interpreted by Oregon Public Health Division) Under Section 4107 of the Affordable Care Act, all state Medicaid programs are required to provide a comprehensive tobacco cessation benefit (as defined by the US Public Tobacco cessation coverage and prevention 7 Health Service guidelines) to pregnant women who are enrolled in Medicaid, effective October 2010. As of January 2014, Section 2502 of the law bars state Medicaid programs from excluding cessation medications, including over -the-counter medications, from coverage for pregnant women . In 2014, the Department of Health and Human Services clarified what constitutes a comprehensive tobacco cessation benefit under the ACA. The benefit must include no cost-sharing, screening for tobacco use and tobacco cessation services for those who use tobacco products. The guidance defines an appropriate benefit as: o Four tobacco counseling sessions of at least 10 minutes each (including telephone, group and/or individual counseling), o All medications approved by the FDA as saf e and effective for smoking cessation, o Benefits should be accessible at least twice a year to tobacco users, recognizing not everyone quits on their first try, o Plans should not require prior authorization to access these benefits. o Cessation benefits shall be provided at no cost to the patient. No copays, coinsurance or deductibles should be charged. The Affordable Care Act requires coverage for smoking cessation. The FAQ1 additionally states coverage is mandated for: All Food and Drug Administration (FDA )-approved tobacco cessation medications (including both prescription and over -the-counter medications) for a 90 -day treatment regimen , without prior authorization, when prescribed by a health care provider. 1http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq -aca19.html National picture 1) MMWR, 2015 2) Review of coverage policy of all 50 states Medicaid agencies 3) 9 currently have full coverage without barriers 4) Oregon's variability means that it is not one of the 9 5) Evidence of benefit from more comprehensive tobacco coverage policies in Medicaid, associated with more successful quit rates.

Decreasing tobacco use among workers Tobacco cessation coverage and prevention 9 Tobacco cessation coverage and prevention 10 HERC Staff Assessment: Currently there is inconsistency among CCOs and Fee -for-service (FFS) for coverage of smoking cessation. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, varenicline, and nortriptyline are effective for smoking cessation. Group therapy is better than self -help and other less intensive interventions. Telephonic quit line counseling is cost -effective. Individually tailored and interactive internet based strategies are likely effective. There is insufficient evidence that hypnosis is effective. There is insufficient evidence that acupuncture is effective, or as effective as other tobacco cessation aids. There are a number of evidence -based strategies outside of the typical health car e setting that are effective at reducing incidence of tobacco dependence and reducing smoking prevalence. Some CCOs are already doing community -based interventions, and in 2016, a tobacco use prevalence measure, available to CCOs that meet criteria for th eir tobacco cessation benefit, will become a new incentive metric. Detailing available evidence -based interventions could assist CCOs and Health Systems Division (historically MAP) in identifying interventions of interest to try to reduce tobacco use preva lence and achieve their 2016 metric goals. There is currently not a clear place on the Prioritized List to address interventions that fall outside of the immediate clinical -coding -based encounter. Adding a new section to the Prioritized List that capture s \"Multisector Interventions\" would allow for addressing of evidence -based interventions that would be useful to plans. HERC Staff Recommendation s: 1) Modify Guideline Note 4 as follows: GUIDELINE NOTE 4, TOBACCO DEPENDENCE Line 5 Persons are eligible for tobacco dependence counseling if a documented quit date has been established . Pharmacotherapy and behavioral counseling are included on this line, alone or in combination, for at least 2 quit attempts per year. A minimum of four counseling sessions of at l east 10 minutes each (group or individual , telephonic or in person ) are included for each quit attempt. More intensive interventions and group therapy are likely to be the most effective behavioral interventions. Inclusion on this line follows the minimum standard criteria as defined in the Oregon Public Health Division \"Standard Tobacco Cessation Coverage\" based on the ACA, available here: https://public. health.oregon.gov/PreventionWellness/TobaccoPrevention/Pages/pu bs.aspx Tobacco cessation coverage and prevention 11 2) Add a Tobacco prevention and cessation MULTISECTOR INTERVENTIONS STATEMENT a.

A B S T R A C T Background Hypnotherapy is widely promoted as a method for aiding smoki ng cessation. It is proposed to act on underlying impulses to we aken the desire to smoke or strengthen the will to stop. Objectives T o evaluate the efcacy of hypnotherapy for smoking cessation. Search methods We searched the Cochrane T obacco Addiction Group Specialized Regi ster and the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, SCI, SSCI using the terms smoking cessation and hypnotherapy or hy pnosis. Date of most recent searches July 2010. There were no la nguage restrictions. Selection criteria We considered randomized controlled trials of hypnotherapy w hich reported smoking cessation rates at least six months afte r the beginning of treatment. Data collection and analysis Three authors independently extracted data on participant cha racteristics, the type and duration of the hypnotherapy, the n ature of the control group, smoking status, method of randomization, and completeness of follow up. They also independently assessed the quality of the included studies. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at l east six months follow up. We used the most rigorous denitio n of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates w here available. Those lost to follow up were considered to be s moking. We summarised effects as risk ratios (RR). Where possible, we per formed meta-analysis using a xed-effect model. We also noted a ny adverse events reported.

A B S T R A C T Background Smoking is the leading preventable cause of illness and prema ture death worldwide. Some medications have been proven to he lp people to quit, with three licensed for this purpose in Europe and the USA: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, treatment pharmacologically similar to vareniclin e) is also licensed for use in Russia and some of the former socia list economy countries. Other therapies, including nortriptyline, have a lso been tested for effectiveness. Objectives How do NRT , bupropion and varenicline compare with placebo and w ith each other in achieving long-term abstinence (six months or longer)? How do the remaining treatments compare with placebo in achievi ng long-term abstinence? How do the risks of adverse and serious adverse events (SAEs) co mpare between the treatments, and are there instances where t he harms may outweigh the benets? Methods The overview is restricted to Cochrane reviews, all of which incl ude randomised trials. Participants are usually adult smoke rs, but we exclude reviews of smoking cessation for pregnant women and in particular disease groups or specic settings. We cover nicot ine replacement therapy (NRT), silver acetate. Our outcome for benet is continuous or prolonged abstinence at lea st six months from the start of treatment. Our outcome for harms is th e incidence of serious adverse events associated with each of the treatments. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) inThe Cochrane Library , for any reviews with 'smoking' in the title, abstract or keyword elds. The last search was conducted i n November 2012. We assessed methodological quality using a r evised version of the AMSTAR scale. For NRT , bupropion and vareniclin e we conducted network meta-analyses, comparing each with the others and with placebo for benet, and varenicline and buprop ion for risks of serious adverse events.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides administrative, research, and technical support for the Community Preventive Services Task Force.Tobacco Use Evidence-Based Interventions for Your CommunityTobacco Use The Guide to Community Preventive Services (The Community Guide) is an essential resource for people who want to know what works in public health. It provides evidence-based recommendations and findings about public health interventions and policies to improve health and promote safety. The Community Preventive Services Task Force (Task Force) - an independent, nonfederal, unpaid body of public health and prevention experts - bases its findings and recommendations on systematic reviews of the scientific literature. With oversight from the Task Force, scientists and subject matter experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct these reviews in collaboration with a wide range of government, academic, policy, and practice-based partners. EVALUATING THE EVIDENCE The Task Force findings and recommendations for interventions that reduce or prevent tobacco use are based on systematic reviews of the available evidence. The systematic reviews look at the results of research and evaluation studies published in peer-reviewed journals and other sources. Each systematic review looks at the intervention's effectiveness and how it works in different populations and settings. If found effective, cost and return on investment are also reviewed when available. For each intervention, a summary of the systematic review, evidence gaps, and journal publications can be found on the Tobacco Use section of the website at www.thecommunityguide.org/tobacco.

THE PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGE Tobacco use by the numbers Cigarette smoking takes a toll Nearly 44 million adults - about 19 percent - smoke cigarettes3 More than 80 percent started smoking before age 184 90 million nonsmokers are exposed to secondhand smoke6 States in the Midwest and Southeast have the most smokers3 3.5 percent of adults and 5.5 percent of 18-25 year olds who currently use tobacco, use smokeless tobacco7 For more information on tobacco use in the U.S., including state-by-state data, see www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics . Each year in the U.S., 1 in 5 deaths - over 443,000 - are smoking related1 For every person who dies, 20 more suffer a smoking- related illness like cancer, heart disease, stroke, or lung disease2 Smoking has been estimated to cost the United States $96 billion in direct medical expenses and $97 billion in lost productivity annually1www.thecommunityguide.org SUMMARIZING THE FINDINGS ON TOBACCO All Task Force findings and recommendations on tobacco use are available online at www.thecommunityguide.org/tobacco . Some of the Task Force recommendations related to tobacco use are below. Reducing tobacco use initiation. Raising the price of tobacco products can help prevent people from starting to use tobacco. For instance, adolescent tobacco use drops by a median of 3.7 percent for every 10 percent price hike. Additionally, mass-reach health communication interventions, primarily television broadcasts, have proven effective to reduce initiation among young people. Joint interventions such as mass- media campaigns combined with price increases and school- and community-based education have also proven effective in decreasing adolescent tobacco use by nearly 2.5 percent. Increasing tobacco use cessation. Strategies that can help more people quit using tobacco include raising produce prices and reducing financial barriers to treatment. Several recommended strategies work best in combination with others, such as mass media campaigns, mass-reach health communications interventions (primarily television broadcasts), mobile phone-based support programs, and systems that remind health care providers to counsel patients about quitting. For instance, combining mass-reach communication interventions that combine cessation messages with a quitline number and that are disseminated through multiple channels have been shown to increase call volume by a median of 132 percent. Reducing exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Smoking policies such as bans and restrictions are particularly effective for curbing exposure to second- hand smoke. Studies show that smoking bans can reduce the level of ETS components (e.g. nicotine vapor) by a median of 72 percent within 12 months. Smoking bans, which entirely prohibit smoking in defined areas, reduce ETS exposure more than smoking restrictions, which limit smoking to designated areas. Restricting minors' access to tobacco products. Stronger laws for retailers who sell tobacco, active enforcement of these laws, and retailer education can help keep tobacco products out of young people's hands. These efforts can decrease tobacco sales to minors by a median of 33.5 percent and cut their tobacco use by a median of 5.8 percent. Decreasing tobacco use among workers. Strategies to boost quit rates in the workplace include policies restricting or banning smoking indoors and in public places, and incentive programs that reward workers for cutting back their tobacco use. Smoke-free policies can also save employers and workers money by reducing health care costs. For instance, quit rates can increase by a median of 6.4 percent among workers using these strategies. An employer could potentially save $10,246 per year for every smoker who quits due to a smoke- free workplace policy.

Evidence-based interventions, including the ones in The Community Guide, were implemented across the state and led to substantial reductions in tobacco use and personal health care expenses. Nebraska lays out a blueprint for success Some communities are finding success by combining several recommended interventions. The City of Lincoln and Lancaster County, Nebraska used multiple strategies recommended in The Community Guide to build a phased approach to decrease local tobacco use. Beginning with community-wide education and engagement, their efforts led to substantial reductions in tobacco use in their county and eventually, to statewide policy changes, including a smoking ban modeled on the City of Lincoln's success.

A B S T R A C T Background The Internet is now an indispensable part of daily life for th e majority of people in many parts of the world. It offers an ad ditional means of effecting changes to behaviour such as smoking. Objectives T o determine the effectiveness of Internet-based interventi ons for smoking cessation. Search methods We searched the Cochrane T obacco Addiction Group Specialized Regi ster. There were no restrictions placed on language of publicat ion or publication date. The most recent search was conducted in April 2013. Selection criteria We included randomized and quasi-randomized trials. Particip ants were people who smoked, with no exclusions based on age, g ender, ethnicity, language or health status. Any type of Internet in tervention was eligible. The comparison condition could be a no -intervention control, a different Internet intervention, or a non-Interne t intervention. Data collection and analysis T wo authors independently assessed and extracted data. Meth odological and study quality details were extracted using a st andardized form. We extracted smoking cessation outcomes of six months fol low-up or more, reporting short-term outcomes where longer-ter m outcomes were not available. We reported study effects as a ris k ratio (RR) with a 95% condence interval (CI). Clinical and statis tical heterogeneity limited our ability to pool studies. Main results This updated review includes a total of 28 studies with over 45 ,000 participants. Some Internet programmes were intensive and included multiple outreach contacts with participants, whilst others re lied on participants to initiate and maintain use. Fifteen trials compared an Internet intervention to a non-Int ernet-based smoking cessation intervention or to a no-interve ntion control. T en of these recruited adults, one recruited young adult unive rsity students and two recruited adolescents.

CCOs play an important role in helping their members quit, including: accurate assessment of member tobacco use status; benefit design (expanding coverage and reducing barriers); benefit promotion; implementing tobacco-free campus policies; and fostering partnerships with local public health agencies and other community stakeholders in order to create tobacco-free community environments. CCOs have submitted comprehensive information about their cessation benefits to OHA via the 2014 cessation benefits survey; the results of the survey are reported in the Tobacco Cessation Services: 2014 Survey Report and can be accessed at https://public.health.oregon.gov/P reventionWellness/TobaccoPrevention/Documents/tob_ cessation_services_2014_survey_report.pdf The strategies are focused on CCO quality improvement activities and initiatives that will affect tobacco use among CCO members in 2015 and beyond. When reviewing the strategies CCOs are encouraged to work with internal and external partners as applicable including administrators, quality improvement staff, clinicians, hospitals, clinical advisory panels, community advisory councils and local health department administration and Tobacco Prevention and Education Program (TPEP) staff.Things to consider include: Who needs to be included within your CCO or among contracted providers to develop and implement strategies to reduce tobacco use among your CCO members? What resources may be needed to support the tobacco reduction strategies outlined in this guide? What external partnerships could help support or lead your efforts to implement tobacco reduction strategies for your CCO? Links to resources to support strategy implementation are provided where applicable. Tobacco Prevention and Education Program (TPEP) staff are available in every county and are ready to support CCO efforts to develop and implement policies and protocols to reduce tobacco use.

Health care delivery systems and providers should consistently identify and track tobacco use status and treat every tobacco user that seeks services in a health care setting. It is essential for CCOs to adopt systems for providers to identify tobacco users and use an evidence-based intervention each time a patient that uses tobacco is seen. Plan-level steps to identify individuals who use tobacco include: Reviewing medical and/or pharmacy claims data Intake assessments at office visits Health risk assessments Encourage and incentivize your contracted providers to ask about and document tobacco use at every visit. Educate all staff by offering trainings on tobacco dependence treatments and provide continuing education (CE) credits Provide resources to ensure ready access to cessation support services (Quit Line cards and information about effective tobacco use medications (e.g., establish a clinic fax-to-quit service, place medication information sheets in examination rooms). Provide feedback to clinicians about their performance. Evaluate the degree to which clinicians are identifying, documenting, and treating patients who use tobacco. RESOURCES: These resources provide guidance for providers asking about tobacco use status during intake assessments at office visits.

CCOs, federally qualified health centers, behavioral health agencies, dental clinics and other health care systems have an important role in offering comprehensive, accessible cessation benefits to their employees and clients. Evidence shows that by providing both medication and counseling as a paid or covered benefit by a health insurance plan, there is an increase in the proportion of smokers who use cessation treatment, attempt to quit, and successfully quit. Improve your plan's covered cessation benefits Expand coverage to include all three forms of evidence-based counseling (individual, group, telephone) and all seven FDA approved medications (nicotine replacement therapy -gum, patch, lozenge, nasal spray, inhaler - and Bupropion SR and Varenicline).

Health care insurers should consistently promote the cessation benefits they offer and systematically refer tobacco users to the Quit Line to help tobacco users be successful in their quit attempts. Actively promoting these resources is a vital component to connecting tobacco users to evidence-based cessation resources, increasing quit attempts, and reducing smoking prevalence. Examples may include, providers' use of brief motivational interviewing with patients, establishing Quit Line e-referrals, mailings to identified tobacco users, and promotion of benefits in member handbook and newsletters. Pro-actively reach out to all identified tobacco users to encourage them to quit or take advantage of their benefits. Providers' use of brief motivational interviewing with patients Establishing Quit Line e-referrals Mailings to identified tobacco users Promotion of benefits in member handbook and newsletters Promote quitting as a New Year's resolution, or connected to national campaigns, including World No Tobacco Day or the Great American Smokeout? RESOURCES: How to Design a T obacco Cessation Insurance Benefit - It is crucial that all health insurance plans and employers cover all of these treatments. But deciding to establish this coverage is only the first step. This document outlines the questions and issues plans and employers should consider after taking this critical first step, including communicating to plan members and providers about the benefit, and promoting the benefit to encourage tobacco users to quit. http://www.lung.org/stop-smoking/tobacco-control-advocacy/reports-resources/tobacco-cessation-affordable-care-act/assets/how-to-design-a-tobacco.pdf We do this now We are planning to do this OREGON HEALTH AUTHORITY CCO Discussion Guide -Strategies to Reduce Tobacco Use Page 5 Strategy: Support Effective Delivery of Cessation Benefits by Providers Through Quality Improvement Initiatives and T raining Clinicians must be adequately trained and prepared to treat tobacco dependence in their patients. Health care systems can ensure that clinicians and patients have the appropriate resources to address tobacco use and that a system is in place to provide feedback to clinicians on their tobacco dependence practices. CCOs can encourage or incentivize providers to use brief intervention strategies, such as the 5As or 2As & R. Clinic work-flows should be assessed to understand where best to use these strategies, and providers should have thorough knowledge of referral pathways to help tobacco users quit. Examples include staff trainings, provider manuals, provider newsletters, and provider website/handbook. Ensure your provider network is aware of the existing benefits Information is shared by way of: Staff trainings Provider manuals/handbook Provider newsletters Provider website Provide tobacco-related trainings to contracted providersTraining topics include: Tobacco cessation benefits Systematic tobacco use assessment and documentation Referral strategies Motivational interviewing/behavioral counseling models (5A 's or 2A 's + R) Systematically embed referral systems in clinic work-flows and electronic health records Provider reminders incorporated into electronic health record Establish electronic referrals to Quit Line Establish referral system to community resources Implement closed-loop referrals Embedding decision support schematics or scripting in the EHR tohelp guide clinicians through an evidence-based intervention approach RESOURCES: Strengthening health systems for treating tobacco dependence in primary care.

Tobacco smoke is toxic and contributes to deaths of smokers and non-smokers. Exposure to secondhand smoke can cause heart disease, cancer and worsen respiratory conditions such as asthma. Many of those that routinely seek health care services are especially vulnerable to the effects of secondhand smoke, including pregnant women, the elderly and people with chronic illness. In addition to the health risks associated with exposure to secondhand smoke, smoking and the use of other tobacco products in public places can normalize smoking behavior for youth. Establishing tobacco-free places creates a healthy environment and promotes social norms that support wellness. Several CCO administrative, contractor, and hospital campuses in Oregon have already gone tobacco-free to promote better health and a safer environment for patients, providers and other staff. Adopt and Implement a T obacco-Free Campus Policy Implement a tobacco-free campus policy for CCO administrative offices Require contracted providers to adopt tobacco-free campus policies Implement supportive practices, such as providing information about tobacco use and treatment, secondhand smoke, and local/ statewide cessation resources to patients, staff, and visitors How can your CCO require contracted providers to adopt tobacco-free campus policies and encourage effective implementation practices, such as providing information about tobacco use and treatment, secondhand smoke, and local/ statewide cessation resources to patients, staff, and visitors?

There are numerous evidence-based community interventions that are effective in reducing tobacco use and preventing youth initiation. These include: raising the price of tobacco through a tax, implementing tobacco retail environment interventions, tobacco-free work places and public spaces, and implementing cessation referral systems in social service agencies. By restricting access, promoting tobacco cessation and industry denormalization, we promote healthy, smokefree communities. How can your CCO/Community Advisory Council (CAC) partner with your local public health authority (LPHA) to reduce tobacco prevalence in the communities you serve through cessation activities or policy change, including supporting the state and local implementation of comprehensive tobacco control programs? These programs are based on CDC best-practice recommendations, such as increasing the price of tobacco and increasing the number of tobacco-free environments.

Certain racial and ethnic groups, LBGTQ population, and those with serious and persistent mental illness have higher rates of tobacco use than the general population. The specific tobacco-related health risks for people in these groups must be considered in the design of tobacco control programs and strategies. Effective and culturally appropriate messaging and outreach to special populations can denormalize tobacco use and help existing tobacco users understand the resources to help them quit.

A B S T R A C T Background There are at least three reasons to believe antidepressants might help in smoking cessation. Firstly, nicotine withdrawa l may produce depressive symptoms or precipitate a major depressive episo de and antidepressants may relieve these. Secondly, nicotine may have antidepressant effects that maintain smoking, and antidepr essants may substitute for this effect. Finally, some antide pressants may have a specic effect on neural pathways (e.g. inhibiting monoamine oxidase) (e.g. blockade of nicotinic-cholinergic rece ptors) underlying nicotine addiction. Objectives The aim of this review is to assess the effect and safety of anti depressant medications to aid long-term smoking cessation. Th e medications methods We the Cochrane T obacco Addiction Group Specialised Regi ster which includes reports of trials indexed in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled T rials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EM BASE, and PsycINFO, and other reviews and meeting abstracts, in July 2013. Selection criteria We considered randomized trials comparing antidepressant me dications to placebo or an alternative pharmacotherapy for smo king cessation. We also included trials comparing different doses, using pharmacotherapy to prevent relapse or re-initiate smok ing cessation or to help smokers reduce cigarette consumption. We excluded tri als with less than six months follow-up. Data collection and analysis We extracted data and assessed risk of bias using standard met hodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration . The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at l east six months follow-up in patients smoking at baseline, ex pressed as a risk ratio (RR). We used the most rigorous denition of abst inence available in each trial, and biochemically validated rat es if available. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis us ing a xed-effect model.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Public Health Summary multisector interventions 1 The p roblem Tobacco imposes a considerable burden on society, including disease, lives lost, health care costs, and lost productivity. Smoking is the leading cause of premature death and preventable disease in Oregon and is responsible for about 7,000 deaths each year. Addres sing tobacco use can save lives, improve health outcomes, and reduce health care and lost -productivity costs. Multi -sector approach to a ddressing tobacco with evidence -based health practices Conducing s imultaneous multi -sector interventions maximi zes the health and economic benefits of addressing tobacco use . Every dollar spent on coordinated , evidence -based tobacco control effort s can yield a savings of $55.i Coordinated efforts are effective across racial and ethnic groups, education levels, and levels of socioeconomic status.ii All of t he following recommendations for p rioritization of t obacco prevention in health spending are informed by the Community Guide , unless otherwise noted. The Community Guide is the official collection of Community Preventive Services Task Force findings and the systematic reviews on which they are based. These r ecomm endations translate this evidence for Oregon health systems within the state's current tobacco control and prevention environment . 1. Provide leadership for development of smoke -free policies in workplaces and public spaces. Like other employers, health syste ms can provide leadership for tobacco -related efforts in the communities they serve by establishing smoke -free campuses through workplace policies and contracts . They can also lend a persuasive voice to efforts to develop public -sector regulations that prohibit tobacco use in public areas. Evidence: Smoke -free policies reduce tobacco use an d exposure to second -hand smoke , and increase the number of tobacco users who quit . They also keep young people from initiating tobacco use and reduce acute cardiovascular events and other adverse tobacco -related health issues . Smoke -free policies can substantially reduce health care costs without adverse economic impact on businesses . 2. Educate policy makers about the positive effects of raising the per -unit price of tobacco products. Raising the price of tobacco products increases the number of tobacco users who quit and reduces tobacco use, youth initiation, and negative health effects . The medical community is uniquely positioned to provide a persuasive perspective on what these population level effects mean for patients and their families . Evidence: Health effects of raising the price of tobacco are proportional to the size of the price increase and the scale of implementation. Increasing the unit price for tobacco products by 20% has been shown to reduce consumption by 10.4%, prevalence of adult use by 3.6%, and youth initiation of tobacco use by young people by 8.6%. Raising tobac co prices substantially reduces healthcare costs, reduces tobacco -related disparities among income groups, and may reduce disparities by race and ethnicity. 3. Implement mass -reach communication interventions to inform individual and public attitudes about t obacco use and secondhand smoke. Communication interventions should be coordinated with a statewide media strategy, and may include broadcast, print, and digital media and out -of- home placements (e.g., billboards, movi e theater s, point of sale). Health sys tem Public Health Summary multisector interventions 2 communications that promote tobacco cessation may be evaluated for effectiveness by tracking quit line call volumes and tobacco use prevalence. Clear communication of cessation benefits to both tobacco users and healthcare providers increases use and i mpact of cessation interventions. Evidence: Strong evidence indicates that mass communication interventions decrease prevalence of tobacco use, increase cessation and use of cessation services, and prevent young people from initiating tobacco use. Mass -reach health communication interventions are cost -effective, with a benefit -to-cost ratio of 7:1 to 74:1. Savings from averted healthcare costs exceed intervention costs. 4. Community engagement via local public health authorities to promote tobacco cessation , create tobacco -free community places, and identify and elimin ate tobacco -related disparities . While Oregon's local health authorities are uniquely positioned to coordinate local and regional tobacco prevention initiatives, they receive only a fr action of the fu nding recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Support provided by health systems should be tailored to the needs of local communities . Evidence : Coordinated statewide and local approaches to tobacco prevention and edu cation are demonstrated to reduce initiation of tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure, and to increase cessation.ii, Example of effectiveness of a multi -sector approach . From 2001 to 2010, the New York State Tobacco Control Program reported declines in the prevalence of smoking among adults and youth that outpaced declines nationally.iii As a result, smoking -attributable personal health care expenditures in New York in 2010 were $4.1 billion less than they would have been had the prevalence of smoking remained at 2001 levels.iv i Lightwood J, Glantz SA.

A B S T R A C T Background Group therapy offers individuals the opportunity to learn b ehavioural techniques for smoking cessation, and to provide e ach other with mutual support. Objectives We aimed to determine the effects of smoking cessation program mes delivered in a group format compared to self-help material s, or to no intervention; to compare the effectiveness of group therap y and individual counselling; and to determine the effect of ad ding group therapy to advice from a health professional or to nicotine rep lacement. We also aimed to determine whether specic component s increased the effectiveness of group therapy. We aimed to dete rmine the rate at which offers of group therapy are taken up. Search methods We searched the Cochrane T obacco Addiction Group T rials Register , with additional searches of MEDLINE and PsycINFO, including the terms behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, psychotherap y or group therapy, in July 2008. Selection criteria We considered randomized trials that compared group therapy w ith self help, individual counselling, another interventio n or no intervention (including usual care or a waiting list control). We also considered trials that compared more than one group progr amme. We included those trials with a minimum of two group meetings, and follow up of smoking status at least six months after the s tart of the programme. We excluded trials in which group therapy was provided to both active therapy and placebo arms of trials of pharmacotherapies, unless they had a factorial design. Data collection and analysis We extracted data in duplicate on the participants, the interve ntions provided to the groups and the controls, including prog ramme length, intensity and main components, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at l east six months follow up in patients smoking at baseline. We used the most rigorous denition of abstinence in each trial, and bi ochemically validated rates where available. Subjects lost to follow up were analysed as continuing smokers. Effects were expressed a s a relative risk for cessation. Where possible, we performed m eta-analysis using a xed-effect (Mantel-Haenszel) model.

Methods: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on interventions for tobacco smoking cessation that are relevant to primary care(behavioral interventions, pharmacotherapy, and complemen-tary or alternative therapy) in adults, including pregnant women. Population: This recommendation applies to adults aged 18 years or older, including pregnant women. Recommendations: The USPSTF recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using to-bacco, and provide behavioral interventions and U.S. Food andDrug Administration-approved pharmacotherapy for cessationto adults who use tobacco.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes recommendations about the effectiveness of specic preventive care services for patients without re-lated signs or symptoms. It bases its recommendations on the evidence of both the benets and harms of the service and an as-sessment of the balance. The USPSTF does not considerthe costs of providing a service in this assessment. The USPSTF recognizes that clinical decisions in- volve more considerations than evidence alone. Clini-cians should understand the evidence but individualizedecision making to the specic patient or situation. Sim-ilarly, the USPSTF notes that policy and coverage deci-sions involve considerations in addition to the evidenceof clinical benets and harms. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS ANDEVIDENCE The USPSTF recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop usingtobacco, and provide behavioral interventions andpharmacotherapy U.S. Food and Drug Administration(FDA)-approved pharmacotherapy for cessation toadults who use tobacco. (A recommendation)The USPSTF recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant women about tobacco use, advise them tostop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interven-tions for cessation to pregnant women who use to-bacco. (A recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufcient to assess the balance of benets and harmsof pharmacotherapy interventions for tobacco cessa-tion in pregnant women. (I statement) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufcient to recommend electronic nicotine deliverysystems (ENDS) for tobacco cessation in adults, includ-ing pregnant women. The USPSTF recommends thatclinicians direct patients who smoke tobacco to othercessation interventions with established effectivenessand safety (previously stated).

RATIONALE Importance Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the United States. Cig-arette smoking results in more than 480 000 prematuredeaths each year and accounts for approximately 1 inevery 5 deaths (1). In pregnant women, smoking in-creases the risk for congenital anomalies; perinatalcomplications, such as preterm abruption; miscarriage and still- birth; and neonatal or pediatric complications, such assudden infant death syndrome and impaired lung func-tion in childhood (1-4). An estimated 42.1 million U.S.adults (nearly 18% of the population) currently smoke(5). Recognition of Behavior The benets of assessing patients' smoking behav- ior are well-established. Common approaches for clini-cians include recording a patient's smoking status as avital sign or using The 5 A's: 1) Ask about smoking;2)Advisetoquitthroughclear,personalizedmessages;3)Assesswillingnesstoquit;4)Assistinquitting;and5)Arrange follow-up and support).

Grade: AProvide behavioral interventions for cessation. Grade: APharmacotherapy interventions: No recommendation. Grade: I statementENDS: No recommendation. Grade: I statement Assessment The 5 A's framework is a useful strategy for enga ging patients in smoking cessation discussions. T he 5 A's include asking every patient about tobacco use, advising all tobacco users to quit, assessing the willi ngness of all tobacco users to make an attemp t to quit assisting tobacco users with their att empt to quit, and arr anging follow-up. Behavioral CounselingInterventionsBehavioral interventions alone (in- person behavioral support and counseling, telephone counseling, and self-help materials) or combined with pharmacotherapy substantially improve achievement of tobacco cessation.Behavioral interventions substantially improve achievement of tobacco smoking abstinence, improve infant birthweight, and reduc e risk for preterm birth. Pharmacotherapy InterventionsPharmacotherapy interventions, including NRT, bupropion SR, and varenicline-with or without behavioral counseling interventions-substantially improve achievement of tobacco cessation.There is inadequate or no evidence on the benefits of NRT, bupropion SR, or varenicline to achieve tobacco cessation or improve perinatal outcomes in infants.There is inadequate evidence on the benefit of ENDS to achieve tobacco cessation or improve perinatal outcomes in infants. Balance of Benefits and HarmsThe USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of behavioral interventions and FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for tobacco cessation, alone or in combination, is substantial.The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of behavioral interventions for tobacco cessation on perinatal outcomes and smoking abstinence is substantial.The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on pharmacotherapy interventions for tobacco cessation is insufficient because of a lack of studies, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on the use of ENDS for tobacco cessation is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. Other Relevant USPSTFRecommendationsThe USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians provide interventions, including education or brief counseling, to prevent t he initiation of tobacco use in school-aged childr en and adolescents.

CLINICAL GUIDELINE USPSTF Recommendation Statement for Interventions for Tobacco Smoking Cessation 2Annals of Internal Medicine www.annals.org\"Ask, Advise, Refer,\" which encourages clinicians to ask patients about tobacco use, advise them to quit, andrefer them to telephone quit lines and/or otherevidence-based cessation interventions. Benets of Interventions Nonpregnant Adults The USPSTF found convincing evidence that be- havioral interventions (including in-person behavioralsupport and counseling, telephone counseling, andself-help materials) alone or combined with pharmaco-therapy substantially improve achievement of tobaccocessation in nonpregnant adults who smoke. TheUSPSTF found convincing evidence that pharmacother-apy interventions, including nicotine replacement ther-apy (NRT), bupropion without counseling interventions\u2014substantially im-prove achievement of tobacco cessation in nonpreg-nant adults who smoke. The USPSTF also foundconvincing evidence that using 2 types of NRT moder-ately improves achievement of tobacco smoking cessa-tion over using 1 type and that addition of NRT to treat-ment with bupropion SR provides additional benetover use of bupropion SR alone. The USPSTF foundinadequate evidence to determine the effect of ENDSon achievement of tobacco smoking cessation. Pregnant Women The USPSTF found convincing evidence that be- havioral interventions substantially improve achieve-ment of tobacco smoking abstinence in pregnantwomen, increase infant birthweight, and reduce risk forpreterm birth. The USPSTF found inadequate evidenceon the benets of NRT and no evidence on the benetsof bupropion SR, varenicline, or ENDS to achieve to-bacco cessation in pregnant women who smoke or toimprove perinatal outcomes in infants. Harms of Interventions Nonpregnant Adults The USPSTF determined that there is adequate ev- idence to bound the magnitude of harms of behavioralinterventions for tobacco cessation in nonpregnantadults who smoke as small to none. The USPSTF foundadequate evidence that the harms of NRT, bupropionSR, or varenicline for tobacco cessation in adults whosmoke are small. The USPSTF found inadequate evi-dence to determine the harms of ENDS. Pregnant Women The USPSTF determined that there is adequate ev- idence to bound the magnitude of harms of behavioralinterventions for tobacco cessation in pregnant womenwho smoke as small to none. The USPSTF found inad-equate evidence on the harms of NRT and no evidenceon the harms of bupropion SR, varenicline, or ENDS fortobacco cessation in pregnant women who smoke.USPSTF Assessment The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benet of behavioral interventions and FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for tobacco cessation,alone or combined, in nonpregnant adults who smokeis substantial. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benet of behavioral interventions for tobacco ces-sation on perinatal outcomes and smoking abstinencein pregnant women who smoke is substantial. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on phar- macotherapy interventions for tobacco cessation inpregnant women is insufcient because of a lack ofstudies, and the balance of benets and harms cannotbe determined. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on the use of ENDS for tobacco smoking cessation in adults,including pregnant women, is insufcient, and the bal-ance of benets and harms cannot be determined. TheUSPSTF has identied the lack of well-designed, ran-domized, controlled trials (RCTs) on ENDS that reportsmoking abstinence or adverse events as a critical gapin the evidence. CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS Patient Population Under Consideration This recommendation applies to adults aged 18 years or older, including pregnant women. The USPSTFpreviously issued a separate recommendation state-ment on primary care interventions for tobacco use inchildren and adolescents (available at www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org). Although the USPSTF ac-knowledges that tobacco may be used in other formsand that other substances aside from tobacco maybe smoked, they are not the focus of thisrecommendation. Assessment of Risk According to the 2012-2013 National Adult To- bacco Survey, smoking prevalence is higher in thefollowinggroups:men;adultsaged25to44years;per-sons with a race or ethnicity category of \"other, non-Hispanic\"; persons with a GED (vs. graduate-level edu-cation); persons with an annual household income ofless than $20 000; and persons who are lesbian, gay,bisexual, or transgender (6). Higher rates of smokinghave been found in persons with mental health condi-tions (7). Implementation Considerations of Behavioral and Pharmacotherapy Interventions Theinformationthatfollowsontheimplementation of interventions for smoking cessation draws from theUSPSTF systematic evidence review (8) and the 2008Public Health Service guidelines (9). Assessment of Smoking Status The 5 A's framework (available at www.ahrq .gov/professionals/clinicians-providers/guidelines-recommendations/tobacco/5steps.html) is a useful strategyThis online-rst version will be replaced with a nal version when it is included in the issue. The nal version may differ in small ways. USPSTF Recommendation Statement for Interventions for Tobacco Smoking Cessation CLINICAL GUIDELINE www.annals.org Annals of Internal Medicine 3for engaging patients in discussions about smoking cessation. This program includes the following: 1) Ask-ing every patient about tobacco use, 2) Advising all to-bacco users to quit, 3) Assessing their willingness toattempt to quit, 4) Assisting with attempts to quit, and5) Arranging follow-up (10). \"Ask, Advise, Refer\" is an-other approach and involves asking patients about to-bacco use, advising those who smoke to quit, and re-ferring them to evidence-based interventions. Treatingsmoking status as a vital sign and recording smokingstatus at every health visit are also frequently used toassess smoking status. Because many pregnant womenwho smoke do not report it, using multiple-choicequestions to assess smoking status in this group mayimprove disclosure (9). Nonpregnant Adults Both intervention types (pharmacotherapy and be- havioralinterventions)areeffectiveandrecommended;combinations of interventions are most effective, andall should be offered. The best and most effective com-binations are those that are acceptable to and feasiblefor an individual patient; clinicians should consider thepatient's specic medical history and preferences andoffer and provide the combination that works best forthe patient. Behavioral Interventions. Many behavioral inter- ventions are available to encourage smoking cessationin adults. These interventions can be delivered in the primary care setting or can be referred to communitysettings with feedback to the primary care provider. Ef-fective behavioral interventions include in-person be-havioral support and counseling, telephone counsel-ing, and self-help materials ( Table). Behavioral interventions may increase rates of smoking abstinencefrom a baseline range of approximately 5% to 11%in control groups to 7% to 13% in intervention groups(8). Both minimal (<20 minutes in 1 visit) and intensive (20 minutes plus >1 follow-up visit) physician-adviceinterventions effectively increase the proportion ofadults who successfully quit smoking and remain absti-nent for at least 6 months (8). Brief, in-person behavioral counseling sessions (<10 minutes) effectively increase the proportion ofadults who successfully quit smoking and remain absti-nent for 1 year. Although less effective than longer in-terventions, even minimal interventions (<3 minutes)have increased cessation rates in some studies (9). There is a dose-response relationship between the intensity of counseling and cessation rates (thatis, more or longer sessions improve cessation rates)(9). Several sessions should be provided; according to the Public Health Service guidelines, patientsshould receive at least 4 in-person counseling sessions(9).Table.

CLINICAL GUIDELINE USPSTF Recommendation Statement for Interventions for Tobacco Smoking Cessation 4Annals of Internal Medicine www.annals.orgCessation rates may plateau after 90 minutes of to- tal counseling contact time (9). Effective interventions can be delivered by various types of primary care providers, including physicians,nurses, psychologists, social workers, and cessationcounselors (8, 9). Both individual and group counseling are effective (9). Effective counseling interventions provide social support and training in practical problem-solving skills(9). Training in problem-solving skills includes helping persons who smoke to recognize situations that in-crease their risk for smoking, develop coping skills toovercome common barriers to quitting, and develop aplan to quit. Basic information about smoking and successful quitting should be provided. Complementary practices that improve cessation rates include motivational interviewing, assessing read-iness to change, and offering more intensive counsel-ing or referrals (9). Telephone counseling interventions are effective (8, 9). Effective interventions provide at least 3 telephone calls (8). Telephone counseling can be provided by profes- sional counselors or health care providers who aretrained to offer advice over the telephone. Providingself-helpmaterials(primarilyprint-based) that are tailored to the individual patient (that is, be-yond a brochure that simply describes the health ef-fects of smoking) is also effective in improving smokingabstinence on nontailored, although several trials showpromise (8). Pharmacotherapy. The only pharmacotherapy in- terventions approved by the FDA for the treatment oftobacco dependence in adults are bupropion SR, va-renicline, nicotine transdermalpatches, lozenges, gum, inhalers, or spray). Evidence suggests that rates of smoking absti- nence may increase from approximately 10% in controlgroups (placebo or no pharmacotherapy) to 17% inpersons using any form of NRT, from roughly 11%in control groups (placebo or no bupropion SR) to 19%in those using bupropion SR, and from approximately12% in control groups (placebo) to 28% in those usingvarenicline (8). Information on dosing regimens is available in the package inserts of individual medications or at http://betobaccofree.hhs.gov. Information for consumerson FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for smokingcessation is available at www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm198176.htm. Combinations of Pharmacotherapy. Using 2 types of NRT has been found to be more effective than usinga single type. In particular, there was evidence thatcombining a nicotine patch with a rapid-delivery formof NRT is more effective than using a single type.SomestudiessuggestthatNRTincombinationwith bupropion SR may be more efcacious than bupropionSR alone but not necessarily NRT alone (8). Combinations of Behavioral and Pharmacotherapy Interventions. Combining behavioral and pharmaco- therapyinterventionsmayincreasecessationratesfromapproximately 8% to 14% (11) compared with usualcare or minimal behavioral interventions (such as self-help materials or brief advice on quitting). Thesecombinationinterventionsoftenhavebehav- ioral components delivered by specialized cessationcounselors or trained staff and often use NRT. Combination interventions often involve several sessions(4)andtendtobemoresuccessfulwithmoresessions. The largest effect was found in interventions that provided8ormoresessions,althoughthedifferenceineffect among the number of sessions was notsignicant. Contact time ranged from 0 to greater than 300 minutes; interventions lasting 91 to 300 minutes weremost common. The addition of behavioral support to pharmaco- therapyalsosignicantlyincreasedcessationratesfromapproximately 18% in persons using pharmacotherapyalone to 21% in those using a combination of pharma-cotherapy and behavioral support. Intensity of behavioral support ranged from 0 to greater than 300minutes of contact; interventions mostoften involved greater than 91 minutes of contact(roughly 40% were 91 to 300 minutes, and 60% were>300 minutes). Pregnant Women Behavioral Interventions. Effective behavioral inter- ventions in pregnant women who smoke include coun-seling, feedback, health education, incentives, and so-cial support. Compared with usual care or controls,behavioral interventions can increase rates of smokingabstinence from approximately 11% to 15% in preg-nant women. Effective behavioral interventions provided more intensive counseling than minimal advice and otherstandard components of usual care (9). Counseling sessions augmented with messages and self-help materials tailored for pregnant womenwho smoke increased abstinence rates during preg-nancy compared with brief, generic counseling inter-ventions alone (9). Counseling specic to pregnant women should in- clude messages about the effects of smoking on bothmaternal and fetal health and clear, strong advice toquit as soon as possible. Although smoking cessationat any point during pregnancy yields substantial healthbenets for the expectant mother and baby, quittingearly in pregnancy provides the greatest benet to thefetus (9).

Useful Resources Primary care clinicians may nd the following re- sources useful in talking with adults and pregnantwomen about smoking cessation: Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention fact sheets on quitting smoking(www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_ statistics/fact_sheets /cessation/quitting/index.htm), U.S. Department ofHealth and Human Services' BeTobaccoFree (http://betobaccofree.hhs.gov/quit-now/index.html#profess ionals), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Ser-vices' SmokeFreeWomen (http://women.smokefree.gov/pregnancy-motherhood.aspx), and the Public HealthService's 2008 clinical practice guidelines (9). In addition, the following resources may be useful to primary care clinicians and practices trying toimplement interventions for smoking cessation: theSubstance Abuse and Mental Health ServicesAdministration-Health Resources and Services Admin-istration Center for Integrated Health Solutions' re-sources for smoking cessation (www.integration.samhsa.gov/health-wellness/wellness-strategies/tobacco-cessation-2), Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tionstateandcommunityresourcesfortobacco-controlprograms (www.cdc.gov/tobacco/stateandcommunity/index.htm), and the World Health Organization's tool-kit for delivering brief smoking interventions in primarycare (www.who.int/tobacco/publications/smoking_cessation/9789241506953/en). Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statements Pharmacotherapy for Pregnant Women Although smoking prevalence is lower in pregnant women than nonpregnant women of the same age, ap-proximately 1 in 6 pregnant women aged 15 to 44years smoke (7). Smoking during pregnancy slows fetalgrowth, doubles the risk for delivering a baby with lowbirthweight, and increases the risk for fetal death by25% to 50%. For women in whom behavioral counsel-ing does not work, other options to promote smokingcessation may be benecial. A few studies have evaluated the benet of NRT on perinatal and child health outcomes. Although resultsgenerally suggest a potential benet, the overall evi-dence is too limited to draw clear conclusions. Nicotinereplacement therapy is a pregnancy category D medi-cation, which means that there is positive evidence offetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investi-gational or marketing experience or studies in humans.However, it has been suggested that NRT may be saferthan smoking during pregnancy (4, 12). Potential ad-verse events reported include increased rates of cesar-ean delivery, slightly increased diastolic blood pres-sure, and skin reactions to the patch. Potential adverseevents reported in nonpregnant adults include higherrates of low-risk cardiovascular events, such as tachy- cardia. There is no evidence of perinatal harms fromNRT, although few trials reported consistently on theseadverse events. The USPSTF identied no studies on bupropion SR or varenicline pharmacotherapy during pregnancy.These drugs are both pregnancy category C, whichmeans that animal reproduction studies have shown anadverse effect on the fetus but there are no adequatewell-controlled studies in humans. In the absence of clear evidence on the balance of benets and harms of pharmacotherapy in pregnantwomen, clinicians are encouraged to consider the se-verity of smoking behavior in each patient and engagein shared decision making to determine the best indi-vidual treatment course. ENDS Approximately 69% of adults who smoke daily re- port interest in quitting, and roughly 43% attempted toquit in the previous year (1). To date, no ENDS manu-facturer has applied for or received FDA approval tomarket their product for smoking cessation purposes.According to a small 2013 study, approximately twothirds of physicians reported that they believed thatelectronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) were a helpful aidforsmokingcessation,and35%recommendedthemtopatients (13). A recent small survey of e-cigarette usersfound that 56% reported using them to quit or reducecigarette use, and 26% reported using them to smokein places where conventional cigarettes were banned(14). Because of the perception by the public and clini-cians that ENDS may be used for quitting conventionalsmoking, the USPSTF reviewed the evidence in thisarea. No studies evaluated the use of ENDS for smok-ing cessation in pregnant women or adolescents. TheUSPSTF identied only 2 RCTs that evaluated the effectof e-cigarettes on smoking abstinence in adults andfoundmixedresults.NeitherstudyreportedanyseriousadverseeventsrelatedtoENDSuse;however,potentialconcerns raised in other literature include the unknownsafety and toxicity of their components and aerosols(11, 15), and poisoning in children who mishandle nic-otine cartridges (16). How the ingredients in ENDS mayaffect a fetus is also unknown. Overall, the USPSTFfound the evidence on the use of ENDS as a smokingcessation tool in adults, including pregnant women,and adolescents to be insufcient. Additional Approaches to Prevention Given the public health signicance of the conse- quences of tobacco use, numerous public health inter-ventions aim to prevent tobacco use and promotesmokingcessation.TheCommunityPreventiveServicesTask Force offers several recommendations on inter-ventions that can be used in community settings (avail-able at www.thecommunityguide.org/tobacco/index.html). The Surgeon General's report, \"The HealthConsequences of Smoking\u201450 Years of Progress,\" dis-cusses initiatives to end the tobacco use epidemic inthe United States (1).

CLINICAL GUIDELINE USPSTF Recommendation Statement for Interventions for Tobacco Smoking Cessation 6Annals of Internal Medicine www.annals.orgmends that primary care clinicians provide interven- tions, including education or brief counseling, toprevent the initiation of tobacco use among school-aged children and adolescents (available at www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org). OTHERCONSIDERATIONS Research Needs and Gaps A large body of evidence on interventions for smoking cessation already exists, and the overall ben-et of pharmacotherapy and behavioral counseling topromote smoking cessation is well-established. How-ever, further research is still needed to elucidatespecic effective features of complex behavioral coun-seling interventions, benets of pharmacotherapy inspecic subpopulations, and the efcacy newertechnology-based interventions. Although numerousbehavioral interventions for smoking cessation areavailable to primary care clinicians, further research isneeded to better clarify the effects of varying levels ofintensity(suchashowthenumberofsessionsandnum-berofminutespersessionaffectcontinuousabstinencerates),whichsettingsofbehavioralcounselinginterven-tions are most conducive to quitting (individual vs.group, health vs. community, and primary care vs. spe-cialty), and ways to tailor self-help materials. Further re-search is needed on the benets and harms of pharma-cotherapy in specic subpopulations, such as pregnantwomen and adults with mental health conditions. Re-search that directly compares types of pharmacother-apy in different populations may help inform providerson which interventions to use with which patients. Ad-ditional research is also needed on interventions forlight or nondaily smokers and to better understand theeffectiveness of newer technology platforms for inter-ventions for smoking cessation, such as Internet-basedprograms, mobile or smartphone applications, andtext-messagingprograms.AlthoughnoENDSmanufac-turer has applied to the FDA to have their product ap-proved as a therapeutic device, because of the percep-tionbyboththepublicandcliniciansthatENDSmaybeused as an option for quitting conventional smoking,further research is needed on the safety, benets, andharms of ENDS. DISCUSSION Burden of Disease Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the United States.Smoking increases the risk for all-cause mortality andhas been found to increase risk for various types ofcancer (such as lung, liver, and colorectal), respiratorydiseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-ease and tuberculosis), cardiovascular disease (such asstroke from secondhand smoke), diabetes, impairedimmune function and autoimmune disease (such asrheumatoid arthritis), eye disease (such as age-relatedmacular degeneration), and erectile dysfunction inmen. Smoking early in pregnancy has been found tocause ectopic pregnancy and orofacial clefts in infants (1). According to National Health Interview Survey data from 2013, a total of 42.1 million adults in the UnitedStates (17.8%) smokes cigarettes (5). Rates are higheramong men; adults to Natives; persons whosehighest education level attained is a GED; and personsliving below the poverty level (5). Adults with mentalhealth conditions have higher smoking rates and tendto smoke a higher average number of cigarettes thanadults without mental health conditions. Approximately27% of persons with a mental health or substance usedisorder smoke (17). BasedondatafromthePregnancyRiskAssessment and Monitoring System, 23.2% of women smoked dur-ing the 3 months before conception (18). Data from2011 showed that 55% of women quit smoking duringpregnancy, roughly 10% of pregnant women smokedduring the last 3 months of pregnancy, and 40% ofwomen relapsed within 6 months of delivery (19).Smoking during pregnancy is associated with fetalgrowth restriction, preterm delivery, and sudden infantdeath syndrome. Prenatal smoking contributed to anestimated 5.3% to 7.7% term deliveries, 23.2% to33.6% of cases of sudden infant death syndrome, and5.0% to 7.3% of preterm-related deaths in 2002 (1). Quitting smoking is one of the most important and yet challenging preventive health measures a personcan take to improve his or her health. Most smokersmake several serious attempts to quit before achievingpermanent abstinence. Scope of Review Thecurrentreviewfocusedonappraisingevidence on interventions for smoking cessation that are relevantto primary care (behavioral interventions, pharmaco-therapy, and complementary or alternative therapy) inadults, including pregnant women. Only pharmaco-therapy interventions that were approved by the FDAas rst-line agents for smoking cessation were included(NRT, Health outcomesincluded morbidity, and perinatal mortality and morbidity.Smoking-cessation outcomes had to be reported at 6months or later to be included; ndings on smokingreduction (based on frequency or quantity only), inten-tion to quit, and cessation at less than 6 months wereexcluded. The USPSTF also evaluated adverse eventsreported at any time point. Effectiveness of Interventions Nonpregnant Adults Behavioral Interventions. The USPSTF reviewed 11 good- or fair-quality systematic reviews on behavioralinterventions, including complementary or alternativetherapies, and smoking-cessation outcomes (8). Evi-dence on increasing smoking abstinence was strongestfor physician and nurse advice, tailored self-help mate-rials, and telephone counseling. Based on a 2013 sys-This online-rst version will be replaced with a nal version when it is included in the issue. The nal version may differ in small ways. USPSTF Recommendation Statement for Interventions for Tobacco Smoking Cessation CLINICAL GUIDELINE www.annals.org Annals of Internal Medicine 7tematic review of 28 studies ( n= 22 239) (20), rates of smoking abstinence at 6 months or more were 8.0% ingroups that received physician advice compared with4.8% in groups that received no advice or usual care(risk ratio [RR], 1.76 [95% CI, 1.56 to 1.96]). Based onpooled analyses of 35 studies from a 2013 systematicreview that evaluated advice delivered by nurses,13.3% of participants who received interventions fromnurses achieved smoking abstinence at 6 months ormore compared with 11.3% of those who receivedusual care or minimal intervention (RR, 1.29 [CI, 1.20 to1.39]) (21). When stratied by intensity level, both min-imal advice (dened as a single session lasting <20minuteswith1follow-upsession)andintensiveadvice(dened as a single session lasting 20 minutes or >1follow-up session) from a physician signicantly in-creased cessation rates compared with no advice. In asubset of 15 trials that directly compared intensive ver-sus minimal advice from physicians, intensive advicesignicantly increased smoking abstinence comparedwith minimal advice (RR, 1.37 [CI, 1.20 to 1.56]) (20).Based on pooled analyses of 32 studies from a 2014review of print-based self-help materials ( n= 40 890), participants who received tailored self-help materialsshowed a signicantly higher rate of smoking absti-nence at 6 months or more than control participants(7.1% vs. 5.8%; RR, 1.28 [CI, 1.18 to 1.37]). However, nosignicant improvement was seen when nontailoredmaterials were compared with no self-help materials(RR, 1.06 [CI, 0.98 1.16]), based on pooled analysesof 33 studies ( n= 29 495) (22). A 2013 review on tele- phone counseling interventions found that recruiter-initiated telephone support improved rates of smokingcessation at 6 months or more (23). Based on pooledanalyses of 12 studies ( n= 30 182), abstinence rates were signicantly higher in participants who received several counseling sessions via a telephone quit linethan in those who received only a single session or self-help materials (10.7% vs. 7.6%; RR, 1.41 [CI, 1.20 30 that recruiter-initiated telephone counseling that didnot result from patients' calls to help lines also showeda benet on smoking abstinence rates at 6 months ormore compared with controls (13.1% vs. 9.7%; RR, 1.27[CI, 1.20 to 1.36]). The USPSTF also reviewed the 2008 Public Health Service guidelines on treating tobacco use and depen-dence for additional details on intensity and content ofbehavioral interventions, as well as type of staff provid-ing counseling for smoking cessation (15). The USPSTFalso considered evidence from additional reviews onmobile phone and Internet-based interventions (8). Al-though ndings suggested a benet, there were toofew studies and the studies were too heterogeneous todraw denitive conclusions. The USPSTF also consid-ered evidence from reviews on biomedical risk assess-ment interventions, exercise, and hypnotherapy forsmokingcessation;thestudiesweretoolimitedtodrawconclusions (8). A 2014 review on the use of acupunc-ture for smoking cessation (9 studies; n= 1892) did not nd increased rates of smoking cessation at 6 to12 months (24).Pharmacotherapy. The USPSTF reviewed 3 good- quality systematic reviews on pharmacotherapy forsmoking cessation in nonpregnant adults (11). A 2012 systematic review on NRT (117 studies; n= 51 265) (25) found that 17.3% of participants taking any form of NRT achieved abstinence at 6 months ormore compared with 10.3% of participants receivingplacebo or taking no NRT (RR, 1.60 [CI, 1.53 to 1.68]).Those who used 2 forms of NRT achieved higher absti-nence rates than those who used just 1 (20.6% vs.15.6%; RR, 1.34 [CI, 1.18 to 1.51]). All studies of dualNRT used the patch plus another type of NRT (such asgum, nasal spray, or inhaler), although which formserved as the control varied. All single forms of NRTsignicantly improved cessation rates at 6 months or more (gum: RR, 1.49 [CI, 1.40 to 1.60]; patch: RR, lozenges: RR, 1.95 [CI, 1.61to 2.36]). A 2014 systematic review on the use of antidepres- sants for smoking cessation (44 studies; n= 13 728) found that bupropion SR was associated with a signi-cantlyhigherrateofsmokingabstinenceat6monthsormore than placebo or no bupropion SR (19.7% vs.11.5%; RR, 1.62 [CI, 1.49 to 1.76]) (26). Based a smaller number of studies (14 studies; n= 6166), a 2012 systematic review (27) found that va- renicline was associated with a higher cessation ratethan placebo (28.0% vs. 12.0%; RR, 2.27 [CI, 2.02 to2.55]). Pooled analyses found that NRT plus bupropion was more effective than bupropion alone (RR, 1.24 [CI,1.06 to 1.45]; 4 studies; n= 1991); however, it was not more effective than NRT alone (RR, 1.19 [CI, 0.94 to1.51]; 12 studies) (8). Smaller subsets of studies from these reviews di- rectly compared types of pharmacotherapy for smok-ing cessation. Abstinence rates among participants us-ing NRT versus bupropion SR at 6 months or more didnot signicantly differ (8 studies; n= 4086) 778) compared NRT and varenicline and found no signicant difference between groups (27).Four studies evaluated bupropion SR versus vareni-cline; although not all of the studies found a signicantdifference, a pooled estimate ( n= 1810) found a lower cessation rate with bupropion SR than varenicline (RR,0.68 [CI, 0.56 to 0.83]). Combinations of Behavioral Interventions and Pharmacotherapy. Combinations of behavioral coun- seling and pharmacotherapy for smoking cessationwere also effective (8). A 2012 good-quality systematicreview (40 studies; n= 15 021) (28) found that partici- pantswhoreceivedcombinationpharmacotherapyandintensive behavioral counseling had a higher absti-nence rate at 6 months or more compared with controlparticipants who received usual care, self-help materi-als, or brief advice on quitting (which was less intensivethan the counseling or support given to the interven-tion groups) (14.5% vs. 8.3%; RR, 1.82 [CI, 1.66 to2.00]). Most studies (27 of 40) used NRT as the pharma-cotherapy and offered at least 4 behavioral counselingsessions (33 of 41). Another good-quality systematic re-view (29) found that abstinence rates at 6 months ormore were higher in participants who received behav- This online-rst version will be replaced with a nal version when it is included in the issue.

Most studies (27 of38) offered NRT alone as the pharmacotherapy. Partic-ipants in the control group may have also receivedsome counseling or support, but it was less intensivethan in the intervention group. Most studies (28 of 38)offered at least 91 minutes of total contact time, andmany (16 of 38) offered greater than 300 minutes. ENDS. The USPSTF identied only 2 fair-quality RCTs that reported on the effects of e-cigarettes forstopping conventional cigarette smoking (8). Onestudy (30) of persons not attempting or wishing to quitfound a higher abstinence rate at 12 months in partici-pants using e-cigarettes than in control participants(11.0% vs. 4%; P= 0.04), whereas a larger study found no signicant difference in abstinence rates at 6months (31). Neither trial was conducted in the UnitedStates. Pregnant Women Behavioral Interventions. Based on a good-quality systematic review of 86 studies done in 2013 (8, 32),theUSPSTFfoundthatbehavioralinterventionsinpreg-nant women (including behavioral counseling, feed-back, health education, incentives, and social support)are effective at improving rates of smoking cessation as well as perinatal health outcomes. Compared with con-trol participants (most often dened as usual care orless intensive interventions), pregnant women who re-ceived any type of behavioral intervention before thethird trimester had higher cessation rates late in preg-nancy (15.2% vs. 11.2%; RR, 1.45 [CI, 1.27 to 1.64]).Their children also had improved mean When an-alyzed separately, behavioral counseling (the behav-ioral intervention in most studies) was effective in in-creasing abstinence rates in late pregnancy and meanbirthweight in infants. Pharmacotherapy. The USPSTF found a much smaller body of evidence on pharmacotherapy forsmoking cessation in pregnant women. Only 5 RCTs(n= 11 922) evaluating NRT use were found; there were no published trials on the use of bupropion SR orvarenicline as an intervention for smoking cessation inpregnant women (8). The NRT studies reported verylow (as low as <25%) adherence rates, which limitedthe interpretability of ndings. Meta-analysis of these 5trials showed no signicant improvement in rates ofsmoking abstinence late in pregnancy (10.8% vs. 8.5%;RR, 1.24 [CI, 0.95 to 1.64]). Given number ofstudies that reported on perinatal health outcomes,meta-analysis was not done. Although results on pre-termbirthweremostlyinthedirectionofbenet,only1study (33) showed a signicant benet. Reported re-sults on largest trial ( n= 1050) reported a higher rate of survivalwithnoimpairmentat2yearsinchildrenwhosemothers received NRT during pregnancy (34).Potential Harms of Interventions Nonpregnant Adults Behavioral Interventions. Evidence on harms of be- havioral interventions for smoking cessation is limited.Based on the evidence reviewed by the USPSTF, onlyminor adverse events related to ear acupuncture, earacupressure,andotherauriculotherapywereidentied.Adverse events related to other forms of behavioral in-terventions were not reported. Pharmacotherapy. A 2014 fair-quality systematic review (35) of 21 studies ( n= 11 647) found that NRT use was associated with a higher rate of all cardiovas-cular adverse events (RR, 1.81 [CI, 1.35 to 2.43]) com-pared with placebo. This result seems to be driven byminor events, such as tachycardia and arrhythmia. Nosignicant increase in major cardiovascular adverseevents was found (RR, 1.38 [CI, 0.58 to 3.26]). An olderfair-quality review from 2010 (36) also found higherrates of heart palpitation and chest pain, nausea andvomiting, gastrointestinal symptoms, and insomnia inNRT users than control participants. The patch was as-sociated with an increase in skin irritation, and oral NRTwas associated with throat soreness, mouth ulcers, andhiccups. Based on a subset of 8 studies, this older re-view also found no difference in mortality rates in par-ticipants using NRT versus control participants (oddsratio, 0.74 [CI, 0.33 to 1.67]). The same systematic review also evaluated the po- tential harms of bupropion SR for smoking cessation(27 studies; n= 10 402) (35). No signicant difference was found between groups using bupropion SR versusplacebo in all cardiovascular adverse events (RR, 1.03[CI, 0.71 to 1.50]). A trend toward reduction in major cardiovascular adverse events was found in the bupro-pion SR group (RR, 0.57 [CI, 9631) found an in- creased rate of serious events in bupropion SRusersversusthoseusingplaceboorcontrolsthatwasofborderline signicance (RR, 1.30 [CI, 1.00 to 19 studies, the current USPSTF reviewfound no signicant increase in serious psychiatricevents with bupropion SR (RR, 0.60 [CI, 0.28 to 1.28]). Itfound 10 reported cases of seizures among 13 000study participants. Bupropion SR labels include aboxed warning about serious neuropsychiatric eventsin persons who take bupropion SR for smokingcessation. Concerns have been raised about varenicline and potential cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric harms. In2012, the FDA issued a safety communication indicat-ing a nonsignicant increase in major adverse cardio-vascular events (37). Based on a fair-quality systematicreview done in 2014 (35), a meta-analysis of 18 studies(n= 9072) showed no signicant increase in all cardio- events (RR, 1.24 [CI, 0.85 to adverse events (RR, contain a boxed warningabout serious events; however, noneof the evidence reviewed by the USPSTF reported onthis outcome. A good-quality systematic review done in2012 (27) found an increased risk for 1 or more seriousadverse events in participants using varenicline com-pared with those receiving placebo (RR, 1.36 [CI, 1.03This online-rst version will be replaced with a nal version when it is included in the issue. The nal version may differ in small ways. USPSTF Recommendation Statement for Interventions for Tobacco Smoking Cessation CLINICAL GUIDELINE www.annals.org Annals of Internal Medicine 9to 1.81]), but the type of serious adverse event was not specied. Most recently, the FDA issued a warning andapproved updated labeling to describe a potential butrare occurrence of seizures with varenicline use and apotential interaction between varenicline and alcohol(38). Combinations of Behavioral Interventions and Pharmacotherapy. The USPSTF did not identify any re- ports of adverse events related to combinations of be-havioral interventions and pharmacotherapy. ENDS.Neither of the 2 trials on e-cigarette use for conventional smoking cessation reported any seriousadverse events related to product use or any differencein the frequency of adverse events (11). One study (30)reported a higher number of serious adverse events inthe nicotine e-cigarette group (27 [19.7%]) than in thenicotine patch group (14 [11.8%]). However, the au-thors stated that they did not nd any evidence on anassociation with the study product, and there was nodifference in overall incidence of adverse events (seri-ous and nonserious) between groups (incidence rateratio, 1.05 [CI, 0.82 to 1.34]). Although it was not re-ported in the 2 trials, concerns have been raised aboutpotentially harmful ingredients in e-cigarettes (11, 15).Because of the large number and variation of availabledevices and cartridge fluids and the lack of regulation,the toxicity and safety of e-cigarettes and ENDS are ex-tremely difcult to determine uniformly (8). Inadvertentpoisoning in children who mishandle nicotine car-tridges is also a concern, and the number of calls topoison centers involving nicotine-containing e-cigarette liquids has increased from 1 per month in2010 to 215 per month in 2014 (16). Based on esti-mates from a recent small survey, dual use ofe-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes may be high:9.4% of persons who smoke conventional cigarettes re-ported concurrently using e-cigarettes, and 76.8% ofpersons who use e-cigarettes reported concurrentlysmoking conventional cigarettes (39). Further researchis needed to better understand how dual use ofe-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes may affect at-tempts at cessation and initiation of smoking. Pregnant Women Behavioral Interventions. The USPSTF did not nd any serious adverse events related to behavioral inter-ventionsforsmokingcessationinpregnantwomen.Ac-cording to 1 systematic review (32), an increase insmoking was reported in 4 out of 86 studies. Pharmacotherapy. Evidence on harms from phar- macotherapy interventions for smoking cessation inpregnant women is limited. The USPSTF found no evi-denceofperinatalharms,althoughthenumberofstud-ies was low and they were underpowered for rare out-comes(8).Similarly,thereweretoofewstudiestomakeany denitive determination on maternal harms of NRT.Maternal harms of NRT that have been reported insome studies include increased rates of cesarean deliv-ery, slightly increasedbloodpressure (1 study reportedan increase of 0.02 mm Hg per day in diastolic bloodpressure over time [40]), and skin reaction to the NRTpatch (8).Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benet Nonpregnant Adults Behavioral Interventions. The USPSTF found con- vincing evidence that behavioral interventions (such asphysician and nurse advice, tailored self-help materials,and telephone counseling) provided or referred to byprimary care providers substantially improve achieve-ment of smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults. TheUSPSTF found adequate evidence that there are noharms of behavioral interventions. The USPSTF con-cludeswithhighcertaintythatthenetbenetofprovid-ing behavioral interventions for smoking cessation innonpregnant adults is substantial. Pharmacotherapy. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that pharmacotherapy with NRT, bupropionSR, or varenicline substantially improves achievementof smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults. Evidenceis also convincing that using 2 types of NRT moderatelyimproves achievement of smoking cessation over sin-gle forms and that the addition of NRT to treatmentwith bupropion SR provides additional benet over useof bupropion alone. The USPSTF found adequate evi-dence that the harms of pharmacotherapy, includingserious cardiovascular adverse events and neuropsy-chiatric events, are small. It concludes with high cer-tainty that the net benet of providing pharmacother-apy for smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults issubstantial. Combinations of Behavioral and Pharmacotherapy Interventions. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that combinations of behavioral plus pharmacotherapyinterventions substantially increase achievement ofsmoking cessation in nonpregnant adults. The USPSTFfound adequate evidence that the harms of combinedinterventions are small. The USPSTF concludes withhigh certainty that the net benet of providing com-bined interventions for smoking cessation in nonpreg-nant adults is substantial. ENDS.The USPSTF concludes that the current ev- idence on the use of ENDS for conventional smokingcessation is insufcient. Evidence is lacking and con-flicting, and the balance of benets and harms cannotbe determined. Given the established safety and effec-tiveness of behavioral and pharmacotherapy interven-tions, the USPSTF recommends that primary care pro-viders direct patients who smoke to these otherinterventions. Pregnant Women Behavioral Interventions. The USPSTF found con- vincing evidence that behavioral interventions (such asbehavioral counseling, feedback, health education, in-centives, and social support) substantially improveachievement of smoking cessation in pregnant women,increase birthweight, and decrease preterm birth intheir children. The USPSTF found convincing evidencethat there are no harms of behavioral interventions andconcludes with high certainty that the net benet ofproviding behavioral interventions for smoking cessa-tion in pregnant women is substantial.

CLINICAL GUIDELINE USPSTF Recommendation Statement for Interventions for Tobacco Smoking Cessation 10Annals of Internal Medicine www.annals.orgsation in pregnant women is insufcient. Evidence on NRT is limited and conflicting, evidence on other formsof pharmacotherapy is lacking, and the balance of ben-ets and harms cannot be determined. Response to Public Comments A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Website from 5 May to 1 June 2015. Several comments re-quested clarication about which types of interventionsare being recommended\u2014pharmacotherapy, behav-ioral interventions, or combinations of both. Severalcomments also expressed concern that the draft lan-guage for the recommendation may cause clinicians tooffer only 1 type of intervention. The USPSTF clariedthat both intervention types (pharmacotherapy and be-havioralinterventions)areeffectiveandrecommended;combinations of interventions are most effective, andall should be offered. The best and most effective com-binations are those that are acceptable to and feasiblefor an individual patient. Clinicians should consider thepatient's specic medical history and preferences andoffer and provide the combination that works best forthat patient. Comments also sought clarication aboutwhich populations are included in the I statement forENDS; the USPSTF claried that the I statement forENDS includes pregnant women. A few comments re-quested additional implementation resources. TheUSPSTF revised the recommendation to include a tablethat highlights effective components of behavioral in-terventions and provided links to additional resourceson pharmacotherapy options and resources for preg-nant women. The USPSTF revised its language onENDS to reflect current terminology. How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding? Because of the well-established health benets of smoking cessation (1, 9), most of the research on inter-ventions for smoking cessation focuses on cessation(rather than health outcomes) as a primary outcome.The current review identied 1 study of middle-agedmen at high risk for cardiorespiratory disease thatfound a signicantly smaller number of deaths from re-spiratory illness at 33 years of follow-up in participantswho received advice from medical practitioners. Thestudy also found favorable effects on all-cause mortal-ity, coronary disease mortality, and lung cancer inci-dence and mortality at 20 years of follow-up, althoughthese effects were not signicant (41). UPDATE OF PREVIOUS USPSTF RECOMMENDATION In 2009, the USPSTF recommended that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use and provide interven-tions for smoking cessation for those who use tobaccoproducts (A recommendation) (42). It also recom-mended that clinicians ask all pregnant women abouttobacco use and provide augmented, pregnancy-tailoredcounselingforthosewhosmoke(Arecommen-dation). The current recommendation updates and isconsistent with the 2009 recommendation. In addition, the USPSTF reviewed evidence on ENDS, an emergingtobacco product, but found insufcient evidence torecommend for or against its use for smoking cessa-tion. The USPSTF also reviewed updated evidence onpharmacotherapy interventions for smoking cessationin pregnant women and found that the evidence is stillinsufcient to make a recommendation. RECOMMENDATIONS OF OTHERS Numerous professional societies and health orga- nizations, including the American College of Physicians(43), American College of Preventive Medicine (44),American Heart Association (45), and American Con-gress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (46), recom-mend that clinicians screen for tobacco use and pro-vide interventions to patients who smoke. Morerecently, with the emergence and increased use ofe-cigarettes, some organizations have incorporatedstatements about e-cigarettes into their guidelines.Both the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gy-necologists (46) and the American Heart Association(43) recommend that e-cigarettes be included in smok-ing screening questions.

A B S T R A C T Background Acupuncture and related techniques are promoted as a treatment for smoking cessation in the belief that they may reduce nicotin e withdrawal symptoms. Objectives The objectives of this review are to determine the effectivene ss of acupuncture and the related interventions of acupressure , laser therapy and electrostimulation in smoking cessation, in comparison wi th no intervention, sham treatment, or other interventions . Search methods We searched the Cochrane T obacco Addiction Group Specialized Regi ster (which includes trials of smoking cessation interventions identied from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled T rials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) and AMED in October 2013. We also searched four Chinese databases in Sep tember 2013: Sino-Med, China National Knowledge Infrastruct ure, Wanfang Data and VIP . Selection criteria Randomized trials comparing a form of acupuncture, acupressure , laser therapy or electrostimulation with either no interve ntion, sham treatment or another intervention for smoking cessation. Data collection and analysis We extracted data in duplicate on the type of smokers recruited, the nature of the intervention and control procedures, the out come measures, method of randomization, and completeness of foll ow-up. We assessed abstinence from smoking at the earliest time-poin t (before six weeks) and at the last measurement point between six months and one year. We used the most rigorous denition of abstinen ce for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if availabl e. Those lost to follow-up were counted as continuing smokers. Where appropri ate, we performed meta-analysis pooling risk ratios using a xed- effect model.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.The Return on Investment of a Medicaid Tobacco Cessation Program in Massachusetts Patrick Richard1\u00a4, Kristina West1, Leighton Ku2* 1Department of Health Policy, School of Public Health and Health Services, The George Washington University, Washington, District of Columbia, Unit ed States of America, 2Center for Health Policy Research, School of Public Health and Health Services, The George Washington University, Washington, District of Columbia , United States of America Abstract Background and Objective: A high proportion of low-income people insured by the Medicaid program smoke. Earlier research concerning a comprehensive tobacco cessation program implemented by the state of Massachusetts indicatedthat it was successful in reducing smoking prevalence and those who received tobacco cessation benefits had lower rates ofin-patient admissions for cardiovascular conditions, including acute myocardial infarction, coronary atherosclerosis and non- specific chest pain. This study estimates the costs of the tobacco cessation benefit and the short-term Medicaid savings attributable to the aversion of inpatient hospitalization for cardiovascular conditions. Methods: A cost-benefit analysis approach was used to estimate the program's return on investment. Administrative data were used to compute annual cost per participant. Data from the 2002-2008 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Surveys were used to estimate the costs of hospital inpatient admissions by Medicaid smokers. These were combined with earlier estimates of the rate of reduction in cardiovascular hospital admissionsattributable to the tobacco cessation program to calculate the return on investment. Findings: Administrative data indicated that program costs including pharmacotherapy, counseling and outreach costs about $183 per program participant (2010 $). We estimated inpatient savings per participant of $571 (range $549 to $583). Every $1 in program costs was associated with $3.12 (range $3.00 to $3.25) in medical savings, for a $2.12 (range $2.00 to $2.25) return on investment to the Medicaid program for every dollar spent. Conclusions: These results suggest that an investment in comprehensive tobacco cessation services may result in substantial savings for Medicaid programs. Further federal and state policy actions to promote and cover comprehensive tobacco cessation services in Medicaid may be a cost-effective approach to improve health outcomes for low-income populations.

It is responsible for roughly 30%of all cancer deaths, for nearly 80% of deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and for early cardiovascular disease deaths [1-3]. More than one-third of the smoking-attributable years of potential life lost are related to cardiovasculardisease [4]. The annual economic burden of smoking in the U.S.has been estimated at nearly $193 billion in direct medical costs and productivity losses [2]. While the life-time prevalence rate foradult smokers in the U.S. population is about 20% of this rate isabout twice as high among adults insured by Medicaid [1-3].Smoking-related medical costs are responsible for 11% ofMedicaid expenditures, representing an estimated $22 billion in 2004 [5]. Federal policy has sought to reduce smoking by Medicaid beneficiaries as an important public health goal. For instance, one of the key objectives of Healthy People 2020 is to ''increase comprehensive Medicaid insurance coverage of evidence-basedtreatment for nicotine dependency in States and the District of Columbia [6].'' Considerable efforts have been made at the state level to reduce smoking. In 2009, Medicaid programs in 47 states and the District of Columbia offered at least some form of coverage for tobacco-dependence treatments, although most had alimited range of benefits [7]. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will increase this coverage; it requires all states to offer comprehensive tobacco cessation services forpregnant women as of 2010 (Section 4107 of the Act) and to PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 1 | e29665Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1194 MMWR / October 30, 2015 / Vol. 64 / No. 42 Medicaid enrollees have a cigarette smoking prevale nce (30.4%) twice as high as that of privately insured American s (14.7%), plac- ing them at increased risk for smoking-related dise ase and death ( 1). Individual, group, and telephone counseling and sev en Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications are evidence- based, effective treatments for helping tobacco use rs quit ( 2). A Healthy People 2020 objective (TU-8) calls for all state Medicaid programs to adopt comprehensive coverage of these t reatments.* However, a previous MMWR report indicated that, although state Medicaid coverage of cessation treatments had impro ved during 2008-2014, this coverage was still limited in most states ( 3). T o monitor the most recent trends in state Medicaid ce ssation cover- age, the American Lung Association collected data o n coverage of, and barriers to, accessing all evidence-based cessa tion treatments except telephone counseling in state Medicaid programs (for a total of nine treatments) during January 31, 2014-J une 30, 2015. As of June 30, 2015, all 50 states covered certain cessation treat- ments for at least some Medicaid enrollees. During 2014-2015, increases were observed in the number of states cov ering individual counseling, group counseling, and all seven FDA-app roved ces- sation medications for all Medicaid enrollees; howe ver, only nine states covered all nine treatments for all enrollee s. Common bar- riers to accessing covered treatments included prio r authorization requirements, limits on duration, annual limits on quit attempts, and required copayments. Previous research in both Medicaid and other populations indicates that state Medicaid programs could reduce smoking prevalence, smoking-related mo rbidity, and smoking-related health care costs among Medicai d enrollees by covering all evidence-based cessation treatments , removing all barriers to accessing these treatments, promoti ng coverage to Medicaid enrollees and health care providers, and m onitoring use of covered treatments ( 2,4-7 ). T o assess state Medicaid tobacco cessation coverage , during August 2014-June 2015, the American Lung Associatio n com- piled data from Medicaid member websites and handbo oks, Medicaid provider websites and handbooks, Medicaid policy manuals, preferred drug lists/formularies, and rele vant regulations and legislation. Researchers searched for mentions of the nine cessation treatments considered in this study by us ing search func- tions on state Medicaid websites, other relevant st ate-sponsored websites, and the Google search engine. These data were then confirmed through consultations with staff members of state Medicaid agencies and health departments, or other knowledge- able state government personnel. Consultations were also used to supply missing documents and reconcile discrepan cies. A state Medicaid program or managed care plan was only cons idered to cover a tobacco cessation treatment if documentatio n was available for this coverage. Information on state Medicaid ce ssation coverage compiled by the American Lung Association is availa ble on the CDC State Activities T racking and Evaluation (STATE ) System, a database that contains tobacco-related epidemiolo gic and eco- nomic data and information on state tobacco-related legislation. \u00a7 As of June 2015, nine states (Connecticut, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio, Penns ylvania, and Vermont) cover all nine evidence-based cessatio n treatments considered in this study for all Medicaid enrollees , up from six states in January 2014. \u00b6 Maine, North Dakota, and Ohio achieved this level of coverage during the study pe riod. However, all nine states with this level of coverage have ba rriers, such as copayments (seven of nine states) or prior authoriz ation require- ments (seven of nine states), in place for some tre atments. As of June 2015, 31 states covered individual counseling for all popu- lations and plans (up from 27 in 2014), and 10 stat es covered group counseling for all populations and plans (up from seven in 2014) (Table 1). Additionally, 30 states covered al l seven FDA- approved cessation medications for all populations and plans (up from 26 states in 2014) (Table 2). The most com mon bar- riers included prior authorization requirements (wi th 39 states reporting this barrier for at least certain populat ions or plans), limits on duration (38 states), annual limits on qu it attempts (36 states), and required copayments (34 states) (T able 3). * Additional information available at http://www.hea lthypeople.gov/2020/topics- objectives/topic/tobacco-use/objectives. T elephone counseling is available free to callers to state quitlines (including Medicaid enrollees) in all 50 states and the District of Col umbia through the national quitline portal 1-800-QUIT-NOW, and therefore is not capture d by this report. In June 2011, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Se rvices announced that it would offer a 50% federal administrative match to s tate Medicaid programs for the cost of state quitline counseling provided to Medic aid enrollees. \u00a7 Additional information available at http://www.cdc.gov/statesystem. Certain data presented in this report differ slightly from Medicaid cessation coverage data reported in the STATE System because of slightly different coding rules, categories, and reporting periods. \u00b6 Nevada was previously reported to cover all nine treatments considered in this report ( 3); however, researchers have since found that the Nevada Medicaid program does not cover group counseling. State Medicaid Coverage for Tobacco Cessation Treatments and Barriers to Coverage \u2014 United States, 2014-2015 Jennifer Singleterry, MA 1; Williams 2Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report MMWR / October 30, 2015 / Vol. 64 / No. 42 1195Discussion Although some progress in state Medicaid coverage o f proven tobacco cessation treatments occurred during the st udy period, only nine states cover all nine treatments considered in this report for all Medicaid enrollees. Moreover, all of these states still have some barriers in place that make it more difficult for Medicaid enrollees to access these treatments, whic h would be expected to impede use of these treatments, quit at tempts, and successful cessation ( 2). Removing these barriers increases access to and use of cessation treatments for both Medicaid enrollees and other populations ( 2,5 ). Comprehensive Medicaid tobacco cessation coverage with minimal barriers has the potential to help more Medicaid enrollees quit tobacco ( 4,5). Continued efforts by state Medicaid programs to increase cove rage and use of evidence-based cessation treatments would be expected to result in improved health outcomes among Medicaid e nrollees and reduced Medicaid health care costs ( 6,7). Insurance coverage of evidence-based cessation treatments leads to increases in quit attempts, use of cessati on treatments, and successful smoking cessation ( 2). One study determined that more comprehensive state Medicaid coverage for cessa- tion treatments was associated with increased quit rates among smokers enrolled in Medicaid ( 4). Effective January 2014, section 2502 of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act barred state Med icaid programs from excluding FDA-approved cessation medi cations from coverage.** , The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has issued guidance to states on implementing this provision. \u00a7\u00a7,\u00b6\u00b6,*** This study finds that some states have improved their coverage of cessation medications during the study period. Other states might have improved this coverage TABLE 1.

Affordable Care Act provision section 4107 require d state Medicaid programs to cover tobacco cessation counseling and pharmacotherapy for pregnant women with no cost-sharing, effective October 2010, which has resulted in increased state Medicaid coverage of cessation counseling and medications for pregnant women ( 8). \u00a7\u00a7 Additional information available at http://www.med icaid.gov/medicaid- chip-program-information/by-topics/benefits/prescri ption-drugs/ downloads/rx-releases/state-releases/state-rel-165.pdf. \u00b6\u00b6 As of October 23, 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had published State Plan Amendments from 36 states declaring that they have implemented this provision. *** In addition to the Affordable Care Act provision s mentioned in this report, this legislation, as written, also provides strong incen tives for all states to expand eligibility for Medicaid coverage. Although the Sup reme Court ruling in June 2012 held that a state cannot lose federal funding for i ts existing Medicaid program if it does not participate in the expansion, 30 states an d the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid as of October 23, 2015 (http://kf f.org/health-reform/slide/ current-status-of-the-medicaid-expansion-decision). This is expected to further increase the number of smokers who have access to c essation treatments in expansion states; however, information for a compre hensive evaluation of cessation coverage in the Medicaid expansion population is no t currently available.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1198 MMWR / October 30, 2015 / Vol. 64 / No. 42 before the study period in response to this provision. State Medicaid programs can maximize the effect of this provision on cessation by placing tobacco cessation medications on pre- ferred drug lists (or similar documents), removing barriers to accessing these medications, and adding notices of coverage to public plan documents ( 9). State Medicaid programs can also increase cessation among Medicaid enrollees by cove ring cessa- tion counseling along with cessation medications, because the combined use of these treatments is more effective in increasing quit rates than the use of either alone ( 2). The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita- tions. First, 2015 data were not available for the District of Columbia. Second, in cases where official documents were not publicly available or conflicted with one another, knowledge- able state government personnel were consulted to provide non-public documentation or resolve discrepancies; this information might have been inaccurate in some cases. Third, cessation coverage can vary widely across Medicaid managed care plans, making it difficult to determine the coverage pro- vided by specific plans in practice. Finally, this report does not assess promotion, awareness, or use of state Medica id cessation coverage. The extent to which smokers use covered treatments is a key factor in determining the effect of cessation coverage, and promotion and awareness of coverage in turn determine the level of use. Although examining these factors is important to accurately evaluate the impact of a state's Medi caid cessation coverage, this type of data is not currently available in most states. It is important to identify an approach to obtain infor- mation on use of cessation treatments by Medicaid enrollees. Although state Medicaid cessation coverage improved dur- ing 2014-2015, coverage still falls substantially short of the Healthy People 2020 target of full coverage in all 50 states and the District of Columbia; almost six million Medica id enrollees continue to smoke cigarettes ( 1). Smoking-related diseases accounted for approximately 15% of annual Medicaid spend- ing during 2006-2010, amounting to more than $39 billion per year ( 10 ). State Medicaid programs can maximize tobacco cessation among Medicaid enrollees by covering all evidence-b ased cessation treatments, removing barriers that impede access to these treatments, promoting their coverage to Me dicaid tobacco users and health care providers, and monitoring use of covered treatments ( 5-7). State Medicaid programs that take these actions have the potential to substantially reduce tobacco use, tobacco-related disease, and health ca re costs among Medicaid enrollees.Acknowledgments Paul G.

Medicaid enrollees smoke cigarettes at a higher rate than privately insured U.S. residents. Comprehensive state Medicaid cessation coverage has the potential to reduce smoking, smoking-related disease, and health care costs among Medicaid enrollees. Although state Medicaid coverage of cessation treatments had improved during 2008-2014, this coverage was still limited in most states. What is added by this report? Although state Medicaid cessation coverage improved during 2014-2015, coverage continues to fall substantially short of the Healthy People 2020 target of full coverage in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. As of June 2015, only nine states cover all nine evidence-based cessation treatments considered in this study for all Medicaid enrollees, up from six states in 2014. All of these states have barriers to accessing some treatments. What are the implications for public health practice? State Medicaid programs can help more Medicaid enrollees quit tobacco use by covering all evidence-based cessation treat- ments, removing barriers that make it difficult for enrollees to access these treatments, promoting cessation coverage, and monitoring use of covered treatments. State Medicaid programs can enhance the effect of the Affordable Care Act provision barring state Medicaid coverage from excluding cessation medications by placing these medications on preferred drug lists, removing barriers to accessing these medications, and covering cessation counseling as well as medications.

Question source : QHOC Medical Directors Issue : There are poorer healing outcomes associated with patients who actively use tobacco products who are undergoing surgery. The QHOC Medical Directors are interested in whether the evidence suggests specific criteria for poorer outcomes which may lead to coverage decisions about elective surgeries.

Evidence Summary MED, 2013 Report Clinical review: There are many studies linking perioperative smoking with surgical complications and poor po st-operative outcomes (such as wound healing, cardiac and pulmonary complications, and death). There is also associated longer hospital stays, need for revision, and increased health care costs. Current medical literature is abundant with studies that demonstrate perioperative smoking is strongly linked to surgical complications and poor post -operative outcomes. Adverse post -operative outcomes include impaired wound and tissue healing, and cardiopulmonary complications such as respiratory failure, cardi ac arrest, and myocardial infarction (Balaji 2008; use disorder and elective surgery Tobacco use disorder and elective surgery Page 3 Additionally, smokers may be up to twice as likely to experience pne umonia, unplanned intubation, mechanical ventilation, and death after surgery due to preoperative smoking (Khullar 2013). These outcomes can often result in the need for prolonged hospital stays, and the potential for surgical revision (Katznelson 2011; Tu ran 2011). They may put active smokers at higher risk for surgical complications, and elevate healthcare costs over time (CMS 2013; Khullar 2013; Turan 2011). Perioperative smoking has been shown to adversely affect outcomes associated with a wide range of surgeries including cardiac, vascular, thoracic, general, (Katznelson 2011; Turan 2011). Thomsen, 2014 (not included in packet due to study's length) 1. Cochrane systematic review of preoperative smoking cessation interventions 2. 13 trials involving 2010 participants 3. Overall quality of evidence moderate due to small sample size 4. Intensive interventions appeared to reduce any complications (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.65, 2 trials, 210 participants) and on wound complications (RR 0.31; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.62, 2 trials, 210 participants). For brief interventions, where the impact on smoking had been smaller, there was no evidence of a reduction in complications (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.19, 4 trials, 493 participants) for any complication (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.40, 3 trials, 325 participants) for wound complications. The trial of varenicline did not detect an effect on postopera tive complications (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.72, 1 trial, 286 participants). a. Intensive interventions were defined as multisession face to face counseling b. Intensive interventions were effective at cessation at the time of surgery (pooled risk ratio (RR) 1 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.55 to 25.46, two trials, 210 participants) than for brief interventions (RR 1.30; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.46, 7 trials, 1141 participants). a. A single trial did not show evidence of benefit of a scheduled reduced smoking interv ention. 5. Conclusions: preoperative smoking interventions providing behavioural support and offering NRT increase short -terms smoking cessation and may reduce postoperative morbidity. One trial of varenicline begun shortly before surgery has shown a benefit on long -term cessation but did not detect an effect on early abstinence or on postoperative complications. The optimal preoperative intervention intensity remains unknown. Based on indirect comparisons and evidence from two small trials, interventions that begin four to eight weeks before surgery, include weekly counselling and use of NRT, are more likely to have an impact on complications and on long -term smoking cessation.

Systematic review and metanalysis 2. 140 cohort studies including 479,150 patients 3. Results: The pooled adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) were 3.60 (2.62 -4.93) for necrosis, 2.07 (1.53 -2.81) for healing delay and dehiscence, 1.79 (1.57 -2.04) for surgical site infection, 2.27 (1.82 -2.84) for wound complications, 2.07 (1.23 -3.47) for hernia, and 2.44 (1.66 -3.58) for lack of fistula or bone healing. Former smokers and patients who never smoked were compared in 24 studies including 47,764 patients, and former smokers and current smokers were compared in 20 studies including 40,629 patients. The pooled unadjusted odd s ratios were 1.30 (1.07 -1.59) and 0.69 (0.56 -0.85), respectively, for healing complications combined. In 4 randomized controlled trials, smoking cessation intervention reduced surgical site infections (odds ratio, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.21 -0.85]), but not other healing complications (0.51 [0.22 -1.19]).

Alabama BCBS (2012) - requires patients to be tobacco -free for a minimum of eight weeks prior to surgery for bariatric procedures. Cigna lists tobacco -free policies on two procedures: (2007) - Lumbar Fusion for Spinal Instability and Degenerative Disc Conditions - smoking identified as a major contraindication and associated with risk of pseudoarthritis; and Tobacco use disorder and elective surgery Tobacco use disorder and elective surgery Page 6 (2009) - Lung Volume Reduction Surgery - smoking cessation required for at least six months. UniCare (2012) - has tobacco -free policies for lung volume reduction surgery requiring candidates to be abstinent from smoking for at least four months. HERC St aff Assessment There is a strong association with smoking and increased morbidity with surgical procedures. The Prioritized List currently has restrictions on surgery requiring smoking cessation for at least 6 months for lung volume reduction surgery , bar iatric surgery, and for spinal fusion. Other elective surgeries may result in improved post -surgical outcomes with similar smoking cessation requirements based on limited evidence . NICE specifically recommends not having smoking status being a barrier to joint replacement referral. There are effective interventions to improve cessation rates that are covered for OHP. HERC Staff Recommendation s: 1) Continue requiring smoking cessation 6 months prior to lung volume reduction surgery, bariatric surgery, and spinal fusion. 2) Consider adding the following Guideline Note , but given the limited evidence, could be a recommendation rather than a requirement (which may be confusing). ANCILLARY GUIDELINE NOTE XXX , SMOKING CESSATION AND ELECTIVE SURGICAL PROCEDURES Intensive s moking cessation interventions (multiple face to face behavioral counseling +/ - nicotine replacement) in active tobacco users are recommended /required at least 4 -8 weeks prio r to elective surgical procedures. Certain procedures, such as lung volume reduction surgery, bariatric surgery, and spinal fusion have 6 month tobacco abstinence requirements. 3) Do not add a requirement for transplantation. While there is certainly evidence of poorer outcomes associated with smoking and transplant, these criteria are managed by the transplant centers and through OARs ; a guideline note may be redundant and/or unnecessary. COLLECTIVE REVIEW The Impact of Smoking on Surgical Outcomes Dhruv Khullar, BA, John Maa, MD,FACS Smoking substantially increases a patient's risk of surgi- cal complications. Despite this, almost half of all sur-geons do not routinely counsel their patients to stopsmoking before an operation. Studies show that al-though up to 75% of smokers who undergo surgerywould like to quit, only about 5% will stop smokingpermanently around the time of elective surgery. Theintent of this article is to raise surgeon awareness of thedeleterious impact of smoking on surgical outcomes andemphasize the unique opportunity in the teachable mo-ment of surgery to enable patients to succeed in theirefforts to quit smoking. Toll of smoking on surgical care and need for action Smoking is the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. It is associated with a num-ber of chronic conditions, including cancer, coronary ar-tery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease.Despite major advances in tobacco control in the 20 th century, 44 million Americans continue to smoke and 1in 5 deaths in the United States can be attributed totobacco use. 1Each year, smoking causes nearly 440,000 deaths in the United States, which by comparison, ismore than HIV, illegal drug use, alcohol use, motorvehicle accidents, and suicides combined. 2It is esti- mated that the societal costs of tobacco use amount to$96 billion in medical expenses and $97 billion in lostproductivity annually. 2In addition to the tremendous toll on the health of the American people, smokingplaces a considerable burden on an already strained UShealth care system, diminishing our ability to containcosts, expand access, and improve quality. Smoking has long been identified as a risk factor for chronic disease, but a growing body of evidence suggeststhat it is also an independent risk factor for surgery.Because this association was first described in 1944, 3 more than 300 studies have examined the associationbetween smoking and surgical outcomes.4Active smok- ing is clearly linked to an increased risk of perioperative cardiovascular, pulmonary, and wound healing compli-cations, including infections, anastomotic dehiscence,reintubation, and respiratory failure. These complica-tions in turn result in longer hospital stays, higher ratesof ICU admission, greater need for repeat surgery, andhigher overall costs of care. Smoking at the time of sur-gery is also associated with inferior long-term surgicaloutcomes and decreased overall patient satisfaction withthe procedure. Importantly, even brief preoperative smoking cessation can substantially reduce the risk of complications, andthere are a number of effective interventions to help pa-tients stop smoking. Studies show that 75% of patientswould like to quit smoking, 5and that scheduling of elective surgery provides a unique opportunity to help smokers quitin the long term. 6However, we are currently not doing enough to seize this teachable moment. Patients are oftenpoorly informed of the benefits of smoking cessation forsurgical outcomes 7,8and unaware of available resources for quitting.9 In addition to the adverse health consequences, a sub- stantial financial cost is associated with these surgical com- plications. One study estimates that the pulmonary com-plications associated with perioperative smoking result inan additional cost of $52,000 per surgical episode. 10At a time when our nation is struggling to curb health costs andmaintain quality of care, increased emphasis on periopera-tive smoking cessation holds great promise. As first-handwitnesses of the enormous burden of tobacco use, frontlineclinicians should take a proactive stand to reduce the healthcare costs associated with active smoking. A key next step insmoking cessation efforts is to involve surgeons to a greaterdegree in perioperative cessation activities. Given thepower of the teachable moment and the long-term healthbenefits to patients, surgeons should seize any opportunityto help their patients quit smoking, without fearing thatbrief preoperative abstinence could worsen outcomes. Spe-cifically, surgeons should identify patients who smoke, pro-vide access to intensive smoking-cessation interventions,and insist on complete abstinence before operating, partic-ularly for nonessential, elective procedures. The goal of thisarticle is to highlight the existing scientific data about theimpact of smoking on surgical outcomes, and to suggestways that surgeons in particular can lead the efforts nation- Disclosure Information: Nothing to disclose.

Arch Surg. 201 2 Apr;147(4):373 -83. doi: 10.1001/archsurg.2012.5. Objectives To clarify the evidence on smoking and postoperative healing complications across surgical specialties and to determine the impact of perioperative smoking cessation intervention. Data Sources Cohort studies and randomized controlled trials. Study Selection Selected studies were identified through electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE) and by hand searching. Data Extraction Multiple data on study characteristics were extracted. Risk of bias was assessed by means of the Newcastle -Ottawa Scale and Jadad score. Healing outcome was classified as necrosis, healing delay and dehiscence, surgical site infection, wound complications, hernia, and lack of fistula or bone healing. Mantel -Haensz el and inverse variance methods for meta -analysis (fixed - and random -effects models) were used. Data Synthesis Smokers and nonsmokers were compared in 140 cohort studies including 479 150 patients. The pooled adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) were 3.60 (2.62 -4.93) for necrosis, 2.07 (1.53 -2.81) for healing delay and dehiscence, 1.79 (1.57 -2.04) for surgical site infection, 2.27 (1.82 -2.84) for wound complications, 2.07 (1.23 -3.47) for hernia, and 2.44 (1.66 -3.58) for lack of fistula or bone healing. Former smok ers and patients who never smoked were compared in 24 studies including 47 764 patients, and former smokers and current smokers were compared in 20 studies including 40 629 patients. The pooled unadjusted odds ratios were 1.30 (1.07 -1.59) and 0.69 (0.56 -0.85), respectively, for healing complications combined. In 4 randomized controlled trials, smoking cessation intervention reduced surgical site infections (odds ratio, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.21 -0.85]), but -1.19]). Conclu sions Postoperative healing complications occur significantly more often in smokers compared with nonsmokers and in former smokers compared with those who never smoked. Perioperative smoking cessation intervention reduces surgical site infections, but not other healing complications. Tobacco Smoking and Solid Organ Transplantation Chris Corbett,1,2Matthew J. Armstrong,1,2and James Neuberger1,3 Smoking, both by donors and by recipients, has a major impact on outcomes after organ transplantation. Recipients of smokers' organs are at greater risk of death (lungs hazard ratio [HR], 1.36; heart HR, 1.8; and liver HR, 1.25), extended intensive care stays, and greater need for ventilation. Kidney function is significantly worse at 1 year after transplantation in recipients of grafts from smokers compared with nonsmokers. Clinicians must balance the use of such higher-risk organs with the consequences on waiting list mortality if the donor pool is reduced further by ex- clusion of such donors. Smoking by kidney transplant recipients significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular events (29.2% vs. 15.4%), renal fibrosis, rejection, and malignancy (HR, 2.56). Furthermore, liver recipients who smoke have higher rates of hepatic artery thrombosis, biliary complications, and malignancy (13% vs. 2%). Heart recipients with a smoking history have increased risk of developing coronary atherosclerosis (21.2% vs. 12.3%), graft dysfunction, and loss after transplantation. Self-reporting of smoking is commonplace but unreliable, which limits its use as a tool for selection of transplant candidates. Despite effective counseling and pharmacotherapy, recidivism rates after transplantation remain high (10 Y40%). Transplant services need to be more proactive in educating and imple- menting effective smoking cessation strategies to reduce rates of recidivism and the posttransplantation complications associated with smoking. The adverse impact of smoking by the recipient supports the requirement for a 6-month period of abstinence in lung recipients and cessation before other solid organs.

(Transplantation 2012;94: 979 Y987) Smoking is well recognized to increase the risks of a wide range of pathologies, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, peptic ulcer disease, lung disease, and cancer ( 1). Smoking has also been shown to be a major risk factor for bacterial and viral infections ( 2) as well as the development of chronic kidney disease ( 3). Most no- tably, smoking increases the risk of all-cause mortality and contributes to approximately 5 million premature deaths per year ( 4). In 2000, smoking accounted for 4.83 million deaths worldwide ( 5). Based on prevalence figures of 30%, the World Health Organization has estimated that smoking will kill 8 million people a year by 2030 ( 6). The adverse effects of smoking on outcomes after sur- gical procedures ( 7), particularly solid organ transplantation, are well documented. After liver transplantation, smokingincreases all-cause mortality, with cardiovascular and sepsis accounting for the majority of deaths ( 8). In kidney and heart recipients, smoking is associated with graft loss ( 9) and delayed graft function ( 10). Smoking cessation should always be advocated by clinicians and indeed is mandatory for 6 months before lung transplantation ( 11). As will be discussed in detail below, use of organs from donors who have smoked has a negative impact on the outcomes after transplantation ( 12). This review summarizes the documented effects of tobacco smoking on solid organ transplantation, with par- ticular focus on the impact of donor and recipient smoking on posttransplantation morbidity and mortality. The impact of smoking cessation and the efficacy of interventions to reduce smoking rates are also reviewed. An evidence-based approach was used for this review. MEDLINE search was performed to February 2012 using the following terms: smoking (or tobacco), transplant, smoking detection, and smoking cessation. Literature for this review was selected from a total of 153 publications. PATHOLOGIC EFFECTS OF TOBACCO SMOKING Tobacco smoking affects multiple organ systems in the human body, impairing both psychologic and physical well- being and are summarized in other reviews and Figure 1.

Minutes 10/1/2015 Topic: Coverage Guidance \u2014Planned Out -of-hospital births Discussion: Livingston presented the process overview, evidence summary and core issues addressed by public comment. Dr. Duncan Neilson was introduced as an appointed expert. He is the Clinical Vice President of surgical services of Legacy health system and an obstetrician/gynecologist. Dr. Neilson reviewed the history of this effort beginning with a legislative mandate that involved licensing direct entry midwives as of January 2015 and an Oregon Health Authority Licensed Direct Entry Midwifery Workgroup that recommended that HERC evaluate the evidence and update the appropriate risk criteria to try to ensure safe and effective planned out -of-hospital births. The sub committee discussed that these risk criteria are about coverage. A woman with risk criteria may choose to have a planned out -of-hospital birth, but this would not be covered by the Oregon Health Plan. There was an amendment made to the box language to clar ify that the intent is about coverage. Livingston proceeded to discuss the options, being explicit about which criteria needed to be ruled out and also allowing for ambiguity when certain criteria may remain unknown if there were not clinical suspicion th at would indicate a workup was appropriate. The example of ultrasound was discussed and the subcommittee agreed that it would be necessary to rule out certain risk criteria. Livingston highlighted some of the risk criteria that had received more public com ment as well as some suggestions for clarifying language. There was a discussion as to whether lethal congenital anomalies with planned nonrescucitation would be appropriate for coverage in an out -of-hospital birth setting. Kim Wentz stated that there ar e times when the prenatal diagnosis is wrong or the parents change their mind when the baby is born. Neilson stated that there are some lethal congenital anomalies that are more black and white and others that are gray. Also, in some cases it may be more explicit that nonresuscitation is clearly appropriate and changes in diagnosis or management plans are highly unlikely. There was a discussion about preserving the autonomy of the mother if the fetus doesn't require treatment. Anencephaly was given as an e xample. After discussion the subcommittee decided to move the revised language including \"nonresuscitation planned\" to be a criterion requiring consultation. There was a discussion of a series of criteria that may not be known if there was no clinical sus picion, but also needing to define what those clinical factors may be. In a discussion about intrauterine growth reduction (IUGR), initially there was a proposal to define concerning clinical signs such as fundal height <3 cm from estimated gestational age over two measurements; however, Neilson suggested that other factors besides 2 fundal height may be important and the estimation of fetal weight is multimodal. The language was changed to state that serial fundal measurements are required, but not to defin e what exactly suspicion for IUGR would entail. It was concluded that both serial blood pressure measurements and serial fundal heights would be required in order to verify the absence or presence of this high risk criteria. There was a discussion of the unknown syphilis, HIV, or Hepatitis B status and a proposal to add \"positive\" status to the coverage exclusion criteria. Members discussed whether appropriate care could be given to a positive mother in a home setting and they decided that given the poten tial risk to the fetus/infant and the potential for intervention, that these would be risk criteria that would exclude a woman from coverage. Syphilis was added based on a staff recommendation as a result of recent public health data showing an increase in syphilis in Oregon. Pollack commented and others agreed that readability of the box language would be improved with categorizing of the risk conditions. Public comment: Jeannie Stagner, CNM, of Klamath Falls. She stated she has been a midwife for 33 ye ars, starting as direct entry midwife and later serving as a consultant to the Arizona State Department of Health Services. She stated she does not have hospital privileges and has a licensed birth center. She expressed concerns that inadequate stakeholde r representation was involved in the process, and that guidelines are attempting to change midwifery statutes. She stated that 100% of her patients would have been found ineligible according to consultation guidelines, specifically raising concerns about V BAC and women receiving outpatient mental health care. She also raised concerns about the availability of consultants, especially in rural communities. Neilson reviewed the history of this process starting with the legislation, the development of the lic ensed direct entry midwifery workgroup, including involvement of stakeholders with midwifery representation, and how the HERC work results from those processes. The subcommittee discussed revising the language around maternal mental illness. Pollack sug gested requiring consultation in cases where there is suspicion for psychosis or self -harm. The subcommittee ran out of further discussion time. There was a discussion about the word \"compliance\" and the feeling it invokes. It was clarified that this wil l serve as the basis for rules and compliance would be an appropriate choice of words. Summary of changes agreed to prior to the end of the meeting: Clarify further that these high risk criteria relate to coverage 3 Move life -threatening congenital anomalies (unless fatal anomalies with nonresuscitation planned) to consultation criteria Add that serial fundal height measurements and serial blood pressure measurements are required Add unknown, or positive, syphilis, HI V, or hepatitis B status to high risk coverage exclusion criteria Categorize risk conditions in box language to improve readability Discuss further modifying the language on maternal mental illness requiring outpatient psychiatric care Discussion to cont inue at the November 12, 2015 VbBS/HERC meetings. 4 From HERC Minutes 10/1/2015 Coverage Guidance Topic: Planned Out -of-hospital Birth Meeting materials , pages 236 -406 Livingston presented the proposed coverage guidance from EbGS. VbBS was unable to complete its review during the morning's meeting, therefore this presentation was informational. Livingston explained that planned OOH births (OOHB ) include birthing at home and in a birthing center. The evidence, which has a potential for indirectness from various factors such as systems of care, licensure and regulatory requirements, came from predominately observational studies from other countrie s (Australia, Canada, Netherlands, UK). The studies were population -based and focused on perinatal mortality, neonatal mortality, cesarean rate and postpartum hemorrhage. Saha said this is an issue where there were strong opinions on both side, an uncommon situation. In opposition, hospitals and OB/GYNs and citizens all advocated against it because of the higher infant mortality rate. As great as the out -of-hospital birth movem ent sounds, there have been many problems. In support, largely the midwifery community, contended they can provide the care and restrictions should be loosened so they can be paid for their services. He said this topic is the most contentious issue the Com mission has faced: If families decided to go against the set guidelines and restrictions, should the health plan be responsible for the health related consequences that can arise? Livingston said the OHA, who have been involved with this topic, has the L icensed Direct Entry Midwifery Workgroup addressing multiple issues related to out of hospital birth. Currently, births outside a hospital setting are being paid for under \"fee -for-service\" rather than through the Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs). Liv ingston went on to say that the Health Systems Division (formerly DMAP) and CCO medical directors have asked HERC to be extremely explicit with coverage criteria. There was some discussion around \"informed consent;\" it may be the mother's right to give birth outside a hospital. Others countered the health system should pay for only the safest and most effective care. Others in the healthcare field shared that many times they have seen informed consent forms signed after procedures. Saha explained one is sue that makes this contentious is there was evidence presented that OOHB was just as safe as hospital birth. There was come contrary evidence as well. Patient selection becomes an issue in these studies. In -hospital births will always be stacked with the higher complexity births that you would expect to have worse outcomes because the complexity causes someone who might have otherwise had an OOHB to have an in -hospital birth; accounting for risk -adjustment is often imperfect. The second issue is the best s tudies came out of Europe (the Netherlands), where the networking system between OOHB delivery 5 providers and in -hospital delivery providers is very strong. If something goes wrong, the woman can briskly be transported to the hospital; the communication bet ween the midwife in the home and the OB/GYN in the hospital is very strong. That is not necessarily the case in the United States. We cannot expect the same level of safety. Livingston reviewed the GRADE -Informed Framework ( page 272 ). There was no discussion. She then began to review the Box language components, which are four pages long. High risk criteria examples in the proposal VbBS is reviewing (no out -of-hospital coverage): Cesarean section or other hysterotomy (vaginal birth after Cesarean (VBAC)) Unexplained stillbirth/neonatal death or previous death related to intrapartum difficulty Baby with neonatal encephalopathy Gestational age - preterm or postdates (defined as gestational age < 37 weeks + 0 days or > 41 weeks + 6 days) Pre-existing chronic hypertension Pregnancy -induced hypertension with diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mmHg or systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 mmHg on two consecutive readings taken at least 30 minutes apart Multiple gestations Livingston clarified the risk of vaginal birth after Cesarean (VBAC) is death since uterine rupture occurs suddenly, not allowing time for transfer to a hos pital. Hodges said some rural hospitals in Oregon stopped allowing that even in a hospital setting because they were unable to get adequate malpractice insurance. Agreeing it can be dangerous, Livingston added that when it occurs it will be catastrophic fo r the mother, the baby or both, and there is no way to accurately predict which birth is likely to be the one. Transfer criteria examples being reviewed Uterine rupture, inversion or prolapse Hemorrhage (hypovolemia, shock, need for transfusion) Retained placenta > 60 minutes Non -cephalic fetal presentation Eclampsia or pre -eclampsia Placental abruption/abnormal bleeding Certain serious infections Consultation criteria examples being reviewed: More than three first trimester spontaneous abortions, or more than one second trimester spontaneous abortion Blood group incompatibility, and/or Rh sensitization Pre-eclampsia, not requiring preterm birth More than one preterm birth, or preterm birth less than 34 weeks 0 days in most recent pregnancy 6 Cervical insufficiency/prior cerclage Life threating fatal anomalies Livingston said some feedback given involved the situation where a baby is not expected to survive due to a pre -birth diagnosis of a fatal anomaly. Families sometime choose to give birth in the home, to allow for bonding time before the infant passes away. In those cases the families opt for non -resuscitation. She reports concerns from others thatsometimes the pre - diagnosis is wrong and sometime the parents change their minds and want res uscitation, which may not be possible in a home setting. VbBS discussed changing births of this type to fall under the proposed consultation criteria instead of a high risk coverage exclusion criteria, because in some cases it is clear that nonviability wi ll occur and nonresuscitation may be fully appropriate Livingston gave a summary of VbBS member's struggles with implementation. EbGS did not delve into implementation details. However, explicit requests from those who would implement these recommendation s necessitated VbBS members needing to identify which conditions must explicitly be known and which tests must absolutely be required for coverage. Chan added this is the most granular coverage guidance we have written to date; he feels perhaps it borders on a clinical guideline. The core of the guidance is to ensure the risks are low enough so there is no unnecessary risks to the child and no extra costs to the health system. Saha agreed and went on to say when there is a condition is a common as pregnancy there is likely going to be long extensive list of permissible and not permissible circumstances. Some community objections center around the \"consultation criteria\" because in some areas it is hard to get consultations and there are some places where a m idwife cannot order an ultrasound because the radiology group is unwilling to take on the risk. Saha added someone who wants to have OOHB is unlikely to want to have many tests and that is fine; the health system just will not pay for the delivery if is un able to confirm that the pregnancy is low -risk. 1 HEALTH EVIDENCE REVIEW COMMISSION (HERC) COVERAGE GUIDANCE : PLANNED OUT-OF-HOSPITAL BIRTH DRAFT for VbBS /HERC meeting materials 11/12/15 HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE Planned out -of-hospital (OOH) birth is recommended for coverage for women who do not have high - risk coverage exclusion criteria as outlined below (weak recommendation) .

DOI: 10.1097/AOG.0b013e3182319737 TOPIC BACKGROUND The Licensed Direct Entry Midwife (LDM) Staff Advisory Workgroup was convened in January 2014 by the Direc tor of the Oregon Health Authority (OHA). The workgroup was established to provide recommendations regarding perinatal services provided to Medicaid enrollees by LDMs. The workgroup was guided by the Triple Aim goals of improving population health, improving the individual's experience of care, and reducing per capita costs. One of the recommendations of the final report of this workgro up to t he OHA was to r equest that the Health Evidence Review Commission develop a Coverage Guidance related to home birth, including evidence regarding: The maternal and fetal/neonatal/child health outcomes of home birth compared with birth in other settings Appr opriate candidates for home birth Criteria for optimizing safety with regard to provider training, equipment, standards, consultation, and other systems of care EVIDENCE OVERVIEW Clinical background From Cochrane 2012 Medicalization of childbirth is a cen tral feature in Western societies. The majority of women living in high and middle -income countries have given birth in hospitals since the middle of the 20th century. However, there are regions where home birth is considered part of normal pr actice. The m ost cited case is the Netherlands where planned home birth is supported by the official healthcare system. There, planned home birth is considered an appropriate choice for a woman of low risk and approximately 30% of all births take place at home. It is o f historical interest to note that the transfer of low -risk births from home to hospital in the 1960s, despite lack of high -quality evidence, was one of the pivotal issues when Archie Cochrane laid out the ideological ground for The Cochrane Collaboration. Cochrane awarded 'the wooden spoon' to obstetrics, because \" the specialty missed its first opportunity in the sixties, when it failed to randomize the confinement of low -risk pregnant women at home or hospital. Then, having filled the emptying beds by get ting nearly all pregnant women into hospital, the obstetricians started to introduce a whole series of expensive innovations into the routines of pre - and postnatal care and delivery, without any rigorous evaluation. The list is long, but the most importan t were induction, ultrasound, fetal monitoring, and placental function tests\" (Cochrane 1979). The relationship between hospitalization, childbirth, and intervention is still an important issue as \"Concern about the iatrogenic 10 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 effects of obstetric interven tion in women who do not have a clinical need for it has put 'normal' birth firmly on the agenda for the 21st century.\" (EURO -PERISTAT 2008). A range of interventions continue to be used routinely in relation to births at many hospitals despite the fact t hat for a long time they have been proven to have harmful effects, or only marginal or no beneficial effect (e.g., fetal monitoring, episiotomy and early cord clamping ). Even though the use of a few specific interv entions have been reduced (e.g., placenta l function tests), in general \"r outine medical interventions have [. ..] increased steadily over time despite the efforts of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group, its predecessors, and other researchers carrying out systematic reviews \" (Hodnett 2009 ). The Cochrane review is about healthy pregnant women at term for whom no serious complications have been identified prior to the spontaneous initiation of birth and for which the birth is expected to be medically uncomplicated. Generally, between 70% and 8 0% of all pregnant women may be considered as low risk at the start of labor. Initial evidence r eview Cochrane 2012 The inclusion criteria for the Cochrane 2012 review was limited to randomized controlled trials that compared planned hospital births to pla nned home births. Authors identified two RCTs; however one was only able to recruit one patient. This study (Hendrix 2009) was conducted in the Netherlands and recruited nulliparous women of low obstetric risk (n = 1). In this trial, 35 midwives in 14 prim ary care midwifery practices were involved in recruiting pregnant women in different parts of the Netherlands where 30% of all births are home births. However, the study author reported that only one of 116 women was willing to be randomized, the others ha ving all decided where they wanted to deliver before being recruited into the study. The second trial, Dowswell 1996, was conducted in the United Kingdom and recruited multiparous women judged to be at low obstetric risk by a consultant obstetrician and l ikely to have suitable home support and home circumstances (n = 71). Recruitment was carried out by one consultant obstetrician in an area where planned home birth was otherwise uncommon (0.5% to 1%). The midwives assisting the home births were community m idwives who spent a few days each month in hospital; all UK midwives are trained to do home births, but the ones in the trial were probably not experienced with home birth. The hospital births were standard hospital care with intermittent auscultation at a university hospital with consultant obstetrician on call (but not called routinely) and full neonatal facilities. One midwife served one to two women in single rooms; she used intermittent auscultation and was not continuously present. This study was rate d as having high methodologic quality, except for the small size. The fully assessed trial with reported outcomes was too small to draw reliable conclusions. Only 11 women agreed to randomization. Four of the primary outcomes in this review were available for inclusion: baby not breast fed, assisted vaginal birth, caesar ean section, and other (non -epidural) medical pain relief. In addition, three other outcomes were reported and these are also included here: perineal sutures, mother disappointed about allocation, and father did not state that he was relieved. One differen ce seems statistically significant: the majority of mothers in the hospital group were disappointed about the allocation while none of the mothers in the home birth group were disappointed 11 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 [(Peto odds ratio 12.18, 95% con fidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 141.1 7; however, the difference is non - significant using a Fisher's exact test P value = 0.07) ]. There were no instances of assisted vaginal birth or cesarean section, and for the other outcomes, there were no statistically significant differences between group s. The Cochrane authors report that these results do not \"contradict the evidence from the largest observational studies (de Jonge 2009; Hutton 2009; Janssen 2009) identified in the most recent systematic review (Wax 2010) .\" Because of the paucity of RCTs addressing this comparison, the systematic review and observational studies listed above are summarized below. Wax 2010 This systematic review did not limit inclusion criteria by study design. The search was through November 2009, and included MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Inclusion criteria included performance in developed western countries, English language, peer reviewed and outcomes analyzed by planned delivery location. Twelve studies were included, including the three cohort studies described below and the single RCT described above, with a total of 342,056 planned home and 207,551 plann ed hospital deliveries. Meta -analysis of maternal outcomes found that planned home births experienced significantly fewer medical interventions including epidural analgesia, electronic fetal heart rate monitoring, episiotomy, and operative vaginal and ces arean deliveries. Likewise, women intending home deliveries had fewer infections, third degree lacerations, perineal and vaginal lacerations, hemorrhages, and retained placentas. There was no significant difference in the rate of umbilical cord prolapse. Meta-analysis of neonatal outcomes found that women planning home births were less likely to have preterm deliveries or babies who were low birth weight. Planned home births more often progressed to at least 42 weeks. While there was no overall pooled diffe rence in the rate of assisted ventilation, one large study found more frequent ventilation among planned home births, while two smaller studies noted lower rates in t his group. Perinatal mortality was similar by intended delivery location (OR 0.95 95% CI 0 .77 to 1.18), as well as just among non -anomalous offspring (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18). In contrast, neonatal mortality was almost twice as high in planned home versus planned hospital births (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.28, absolute number 32 out of 16 ,500 planned home births [0.20%] compared to 32 out of 33,302 planned hospital births [0.09%]), and almost tripled among non -anomalous neonates (OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.32 to 6.25, absolute number 23 out of 15,633 planned home births [0.15%] compared to 14 out o f 31,999 planned hospital births [0.04%]). While the reason for the difference between neonatal and perinatal mortality rates is unclear from this analysis, the authors speculate that it may be due to the lower obstetric risk associated with patients plann ing home births. If this is the case, planned home births may face a higher perinatal mortality rate than similar risk planned hospital births. The results of the sensitivity analyses excluding studies that included home births attended by other than cert ified midwives or certified nurse midwives had findings similar to the original analysis, except that the ORs for neonatal deaths among all (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, were not statistically signi ficant. 12 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 de Jonge 2009 This is a nationwide cohort study conducted in the Netherlan ds that included a total of 529, 688 low -risk women who were in primary midwife -led care at the onset of labor. In the Netherlands, the indications for referral to an obstetri cian have been agreed upon by the professional groups involved and are laid out in the \"Obstetric Indication List\" (see Appendix A). Of these, 321, 307 (60.7%) inte nded to give birth at home, 163, 261 (30.8%) planned to gi ve birth in hospital and for 45, 120 (8.5%), the intended place of birth was unknown. Authors adjusted for a number of maternal characteristics ( e.g., parity, gestational age, maternal age, ethnic background and socioeconomic status). No significant differences were found between planned hom e and planned hospital birth in neonatal outcomes reported. Adjusted relative risks (RR) and 95% CI were as follows: intra partum death (RR 0.97, 95% CI: 0.69 to 1.37), intrapartum death and neonatal death during the first 24 hours (RR 1.02, 95% CI: 0.77 to 1.36), intrapartum death and ne onatal up to 7 days (RR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.78 to 1.27), admission to care unit (RR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.16). Hutton 2009 Midwives in Ontario, Canada, provide care in the home and hospital and are req uired to submit data for all births to the Ontario Ministry of Health database. The purpose of this study was to compare maternal and perinatal/neonatal mortality and morbidity and intrapartum intervention rates for women attended by Ontario midwives who p lanned a home birth compared with similar low -risk women who planned a hospital birth between 2003 and 2006. The following types of pregnancies are not eligible for home birth in Ontario: Twins Breech Medical complications in the mother More than one prior cesarean section Gestational age less than 37 or more than 42 weeks The database provided outcomes for all women planning a home birth at the onset of labor (n = 6,692) and for a cohort, stratified by parity, of similar low -risk women planning a hospital birth. The rate of perinatal and neonatal mortality was very low (1/1,000) for both groups, and no difference was shown between groups in a composite measure of perinatal and neonatal mortality or ser ious 2.8%, 95% CI: 0.84 [0.68 -1.03 ]). No maternal deaths were reported. All measures of maternal morbidity were lower in the planned home birth group, including augmentation (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.80), pharmaceutical pain relief (RR 95% CI 0.35 to 0.39), episiotomy (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.84), (RR 0.67, CI 0.56 to CI 0.83 to 0.90) , and blood loss greater than 1,000 ml (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.96). In addition, the rates for cesarean section were lower in the planned home birth group (5.2% vs 8.1%, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.73). When stratified by parity, nulliparas were less likely to deliver at home, and had higher rates of ambulance transport from home to hospital than m ultiparas planning home birth. However, nullipa ras planning home birth still had rates of intervention and outcomes that were similar to, or lower than, nulliparas planning hospital births. 13 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 Janssen 2009 This study was also a retrospective cohort study utilizing a database of all births in the province of British Columbia that occurred between 2000 and 2004. Eligibility for home birth by the College of Midwives of British Columbia includes the following: Absence of significant pre -existing disease in the mother Absence of significant disease arising dur ing pregnancy ( e.g., pregnancy -induced Singleton fetus Cephalic presentation Gestation al age between 36 and 41 weeks No more than one prior cesarean section Spontaneous labor (or induced as an outpatient) No transfer from a referring hospital Planned home births were compared to midwife attended planned hospital births and physician attended planned hospital births, both limited to patients who met the criteria for home birth and matched by age, parity, single parent status, maternal age , and hospital location. There were 2 ,899 women in the planned home birth group, 4 ,752 in the planned hospital birth group attended by midwives, and 5 ,331 in the planned hospital group attended by ph ysicians. The perina tal mortality rate was 0.35/ 1,000 births in the home birth group, 0.57/ 1,000 in the hospital midwife group and 0.64 /1,000 in the hospital physician group, with no statistically significant differences between groups (RR for home midwif e vs. hospital midwife 0.61, 95% CI 0.06 to 5.88; RR for home midwife vs. hospital physician 0.55, 95% CI 0.06 to 5.25). Infants in the planned home birth group were significantly less likely to have an Apgar score less than seven at one minute, to suffer birth trauma, or to require resuscitation or oxygen therapy for more than 24 hours when compared to either hospital group. Compared to planned home birth, the frequency of obstetric interventions was higher in the planned hospital group (either physician or midwife), including fetal monitoring (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.36 for midwife, RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.19 for physician), augmentation of labor (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.69 for midwife, RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.51 for physician), assisted elivery (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.52 for midwife, RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.27 for physician), cesarean section (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.91 for midwife, RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.76 for physician) and episiotomy (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.63 for midwife , RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.23 for physician). They were also more likely to have third or fourth degree perineal tears (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.63 for midwife, RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.49 for physician). 14 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 April 2015 New Evidence Search Results (References listed on pages six to nine .) Background At the April 2, 2015 meeting, the EbGS asked for a full evidence search on OOH birth literature due to concerns raised in public comment and testimony about the completeness of evidence identified in the initial trusted source search published to the OHA website in August 2014. Public comments and testimony raised the issue of risk of perinatal mortality, particularly for primiparous women, in planned OOH birth. It also raised the issue of assuring that th e evidence spoke to planned OOH birth compared to planned hospital birth, with the recognition that unplanned OOH birth was outside the topical area and that mixing evidence from these two populations would be misleading. Staff were also concerned that the initial search did not explicitly include birth centers . Amending the coverage guidance to encompass this site , staff determined that a broader , new evidence search was warranted. Th e new evidence search focused on perinatal mortality and mode of birth be cause those outcomes appeared to encompass both the greatest potential harm and benefit of OOH birth. In addition, the new search explicitly included terms related to birth centers since the initial search was focused on home birth. Appendix C includes details about the search, inclusion criteria , review methodology , and a full evidence table with the 15 included studies. New Evidence Search The new evidence search ( MEDLINE \u00ae) conducted on April 22, 2015 yielded 596 citations and a final search on May 20, 2015 identified an additional 21 citations. The MEDLINE \u00ae search was limited to the past 10 years and not limit ed by study design. These 617 citations were subject to dual revie w for possible inclusion. See Appendix C for details on the search strategy and inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria specified study size, relevant fetal/neonatal and maternal outcomes, and location of study. At least one study arm had to include subject s with planned OOH birth, either at home or in a birth center. Two s taff epidemiologists reviewed 40 full text articles and found 15 that met inclusion criteria. All included studies were dual rated for quality of evidence for key oucomes, based on the GRA DE system. No study was excluded based on quality in accord with accepted practice for systematic review s (SRs) . See Appendix C for GRADE quality ratings. The new search located two SRs and no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) . The first SR (Olsen, 2012) was the Cochrane Review discussed in the prior evidence summary. It included two RCTs, one with a single patient and another with 11 subjects. Neither of these individual trials met the new evidence search inclusion criteria base d on study date and sample size. The second SR identified (Wax, 2010) was also identified in the trusted sources and is discussed in the initial evidence summary above . It was excluded from the new evidence summary because , on closer examination , it was clear that it incorporated studies including women who had unplanned births at home rather than restricting inclusion to studies reporting planned home birth exclusively. Three of 12 studies included in the Wax (2010) SR are also included in this new evidence search and summary . Nine of 12 of the individual studies captured in the Wax SR (2010) were excluded from the new evidence search on the basis of date (published more than 10 years ag o). It appears that the new search strategy was more comprehensive than that us ed by Wax (2010) , yielding 617 citations as compared with 237 for Wax (2010). The 15 studies meeting final inclusion criteria are included in the evidence table in Appendix C. 15 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 Results Context To contextualize the results it is important to understand base line risks of perinatal mortality and other harms among women experiencing hospital births. For the U.S. as a whole, perinatal mortality has remained relatively stable over recent years .1 Perinatal mortality is defined and reported in the U.S. in two ways: first, as the number of fetal and early neonatal deaths (0 to 7 days of life) per 1000 live births and eligible fetal deaths (over 20 weeks of gestation); and second, with the addition of late neonatal deaths (those taking place between 7 and 28 days of l ife).2 Some countries and studies use alternate definitions, such as reporting only neonatal deaths during the first week of life (early neonatal death) or only including gestations above 24 weeks, making international comparison difficult. However, there are still clear differences across countries and among populations, even with these definitional issues. For example, the World Health Organization reported a 2000 perinatal mortality rate of 6 in Australia, Belgium, Finland, and Canada; 7 for the U.S.; 8 for the U.K. and rising to rates well above 80 in many countries of the developing world.3 The U.S. National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) reported a U.S. rate (first definition, using stillbirths and early neonatal deaths) of 6.51 in 2006 with a sli ght decline to 6.26 in 2011,1 but did not report perinatal mortality by parity. However, the risk of perinatal death varies by gestational age and co -existing maternal and fetal/neonatal factors. For example, infant mortality rates for low -risk pregnancies at term vary from a high of 0.66 at 37 weeks to a nadir of 0.33 at 39 weeks and an intermediate level o f 0.40 at 41 weeks .4 Similarly, the fetal mortality rate varies from 1.40 at 37 to 39 weeks, to 0.88 at 40 weeks and increases late in pregnancy to 1.76 at 42 or more week s of gestation .2 In 2006, the overall perinatal mortality rate in O regon was 5.27 .2 During 2012, there were 92 reported term fetal deaths and early neonatal deaths in the state. Of these 92 deaths, 84 occurred in planned hospital births and 8 occurred in planned OOH births.5 These rates were not reported by parity. Chart review of the ei ght cases of intrapartum and early neonatal death found that six of the eight did not meet low -risk criteria. The total term perinatal mortality rate for planned OOH births in Oregon in 2012 was 4.0 and for planned in-hospital births was 2.1 .5 The perinata l mortality rate , and perinatal morbidity more generally, is higher among women having a first birth (primiparous women) than those having a subsequent birth (multiparous women), regardless 1 Gregory, E.C., MacDorman, M.F., & Martin, J.A.

For example, Cheng (2013) found that the risk of low Apgar score was nearly twice as high among low risk primiparous women having a hospital birth in the U.S. than among multiparous women in that setting. The Birthplace study, conducted in the U.K. , reported that the incidence of stillbirth among low ri sk multiparous women giving birth in hospital obstetric units was half of what it was for primiparous women in the same types of hospital settings (Birthplace, 2011). They also reported that the incidence of neonatal death within the first week of life was four times as common among primiparas (Birthplace, 2011). Similarly, de Jonge (2009) reported that the adjusted relative risk of stillbirth or death within the first week of life was 1.68 for primiparous women compared to multiparous women in a study from the Netherlands. While the absolute risk of these outcomes is low, it is important to note the relative baseline differences among first and subsequent births. Summary of Results - New Search A summary table of included studies and results for our primary outcomes of interest is presented in Table 1 below. Four of the 15 studies were conducted in the U.S. and the remainder were based in Australia, Canada, England, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. Two studies provid ed low quality evidence for the primary o utcome s of interest and 13 studies yielded very low quality evidence. This is largely because all studies were observational and most (11 of 15) were conducted outside the U.S., thus introducing indirectness and potential for non -comparability to the U.S. setting . Ten studies reported measures of perinatal mortality with definitions ranging from intrapartum fetal deaths plus neonatal deaths within the first 24 hours of life up to 28 days. These rates (per 1000 births) ranged from 0.87 to 2.06 for planned h ome birth among non -comparative studies. Among comparative studies, perinatal mortality (measured as stillbirths and neonatal deaths up to 28 days) ranged from a protective relative risk (RR) of 0.61 in t he Canadian study by Janssen (2 009) to an excess adjusted RR of 1.38 in the Australian study by Kennere (2009). No confidence interval (CI) was statistically significant and the CIs of these studies were overlapping. Cesarean deli very rates were low overall, but statistically lower in the planned OOH birth group among comparative studies . Two studies contributed data only on postpartum hemorrhage (Davis, 2011; Nove, 2012). Both found a decreased risk of postpartum hemorrhage with home birth, but only one of these findings was statistically significant. Table 1.

While several studies presented data on the overall perinatal mortality rate for the entire study population of women having a first birth and women having subsequent birth, only four studies provided those data by parity. See Table 2 below for perinatal mortality outcomes reported by parity. Only one non -comparative U.S. -based study contributed information on t he risk of perinatal mortality among primiparous women compared to multiparous women. Cheyney reported 18/3771 (0.48%) cases of perinatal death (intrapartum through among primiparas compared 17/13,153 (0.13%) for multiparas. T he stillbirth vs. 0.84 for primiparas multiparas. Among primiparous women experiencing perinatal death , eight women had risk factors including breech presentation, gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. For the 10 cases of perinatal death among women who did not have these risk factors, the intrapartum stillbirth rate was 2.21; the early neonatal perinatal mortality rate was 0.28; and the late neonatal mortality rate was also 0.28, for a total perinatal mort ality rate of 2.77 among low -risk primiparous women (Cheyney , personal communication, 2015 ).

U.S. -based Studies Reporting Perinatal Mortality and Cesarean Delivery Rate There were four U.S. -based studies with two presenting low quality evidence (Cheyney, 2014; Stapleton, 2013) and two with very low quality evidence (Cheng, 2013; Johnson, 2005). Neither of the low quality evidence studies was comparative, but both were large and well -conducted (Cheyney, 2014; Staple ton, 2013). Cheyney (2014) presented data on home birth and the Stapleton (2013) studied birth center outcomes. Cheng (2013) did not report perinatal mortality and is discussed in a separate section below. 22 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 Johnson (2005) used data collected by midwives reg istered by the North American Registry of Midwives (NARM) as a requirement of recertification. It is smaller and older than Cheyney (2014), but similar in that it was conducted by a midwifery registration organization. For home birth in the U.S., Cheyney (2014) found a non -anomalous perinatal mortality rate (stillbirth to neonatal death within 28 days) of 2.06. Johnson (2005) reported a similar finding with a non -anomolous perinatal mortality rate (intrapartum stillbirth to 28 days) of 2.03. Stapleton (201 3) reported a non - anomalous perinatal mortality rate (stillbirth to neonatal death within 7 days) of 0.87. The reported cesarean delivery rates were similar across the U.S. -based studies, ranging from 3.7% (Johnson, 2005) to 5.2% (Cheyney, 2014) to 6.1% (S tapleton, 2013). U.S. -based Study Reporting Low Apgar Score Outcome The fourth U.S. -based study did not report perinatal mortality, but instead reported the surrogate outcome of low Apgar score (5 -minute Apgar score less than 4) (Cheng, 2013). Cheng (2013 ) reported lower odds (but not statistically different) of low Apgar score for home births attended by certified nurse midwives (CNMs) compared to hospital births for either primiparous or multiparous women (adjusted When the comparison was for home birth attended by other types of midwives compared with hospital birth, Cheng and colleagues (2013) found the odds of low Apgar score to be elevated in both parity groups (not statistica lly significant for primiparous women, but statistically significant for multiparous women), with the adjOR of 1.34 (95%CI CI 1.04 -3.26) for multiparas. Based on other research, the association between a low 5 -minute Apgar and the live born infant dying when this occurs is moderate, with about 20 neonatal deaths out of every 1000 (2%) births .6,7 Other methodologic limitations also exist for this type of birth certificate -based study8,9 and contributed to the rating of very low quality evidence for this study. Non -U.S. -based Studies Reporting Perinatal Mortlity by Parity Among non -U.S. studies, three provided information on perinatal mortality by parity and compared planned home and hos pital birth (Birthplace, 2011; de Jonge, 2015; Hutton, 2009). The information from the prospective Birthplace study (2011) for stillbirth and neonatal death in the first week of life should be interpreted cautiously as these items were not the primary outc ome (which was a composite outcome including both items, but also including items suc h as humeral and clavicular fracture). Total event rates were small, confidence intervals (CI) are wide, and only unadjusted figures are available from the online appendic es to the article.

Annals of Epidemiology, 11 (3), 186 -193. 23 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 home birth was 0.9 (95% CI 0.2 -3.3), while the rate for multiparous women was 0.1 (95% CI 0.0 -0.9) (Birthplace, 2011). The rate of early neonatal death was 0.4 (95% CI 0.1 -2.4) a mong primiparas and 0.3 (95% CI 0.1 -1.3) for multiparas (Birthplace, 2011). Hutton (2009) conducted a retrospective matched cohort study of planned home birth in Ontario, Canada. They reported that the proportion of non - anomalous perinatal deaths (stillbir th to 28 days) for primiparous (0.2%) vs. multiparous women (0.1%) was the same for both planned home and hospital birth (Hutton, 2009). The total number of non - anomalous perinatal deaths was small, with nine among primiparous women and six among multipara s (Hutton, 2009). A large retrospective, national study from the Netherlands by de Jonge and colleagues (de Jonge, 2015) found that for primiparous women planning home birth, 1.02% experienced perinatal death (stillbirths and neonatal deaths up to 28 days) compared to 1.09% planning a hospital birth, with an adjOR of 0.99 (95% CI 0.79 -1.24). Among multiparous women the comparable figures were 0.59% vs. 0.58%, with an adjOR of 1.16 (95% CI 0.87 -1.55) (de Jonge, 2015). Summary - New Evidence Search In summa ry, the additional literature review found that rates of cesarean delivery are lower for both primiparous and multiparous women planning a home birth compared to a hospital birth. Neonatal risks varied across studies. Among comparative studies, two reporte d a slightly higher perinatal mortality risk for nulliparous women planning a home birth compared to a hospital birth and one reported a slightly lower risk at home compared to hospital. These three comparative studies were from three different countries a nd the only U.S. study to report perinatal mortality by parity was not comparative. Estimates of perinatal mortality are unstable because of small numbers of this fortunately rare outcome. Among the four studies in Table 2 there were 677 occurrences of per inatal death among 817,812 total births (0.82%). Comparisons are limited by differences in outcome and population definitions, differences among OOH birth provider training and regulation, differences among risk status of women planning home birth, and differences among health systems. Because of all these factors and the low quality of available evidence, we cannot exclude a small increase in perinatal risk, particularly for nulliparous women who choose to plan a home birth rather than a hospital birth. Ho wever, available evidence indicates that the absolute risk is small, particularly among low -risk women and in situations where there are well -trained OOH birth attendants and functioning systems for consultation and transfer to higher levels of care when t he need arises. Guidelines The NICE guideline on intrapartum care in healthy women was published in December 2014 . The guideline recommends the following regarding place of birth: Women at low risk of complications 1.1.1 Explain to women who are at low risk of complications that giving birth is generally very safe for both the woman and her baby. [ new 2014] 1.1.2 Explain to both multiparous and nulliparous women that they may choose any birth setting (home, freestanding midwifery unit, alongside midwifery unit or obstetric unit), and support them in their choice of setting wherever they choose to give birth : [new 2014] 24 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 Advise low -risk multiparous women that planning to give birth at home or in a midwifery -led unit (freestanding or alongside) is pa rticularly suitable for them because the rate of interventions is lower and the outcome for the baby is no different compared with an obstetric unit. [new 2014] Advise low -risk nulliparous women that planning to give birth in a midwifery -led unit (freestan ding or alongside) is particularly suitable for them because the rate of interventions is lower and the outcome for the baby is no different compared with an obstetric unit. Explain that if they plan birth at home there is a small increase in the risk of a n adverse outcome for the baby. [new 2014] 1.1.3 Using Tables 3 and 4, explain to low -risk multiparous women Planning birth at home or in a freestanding midwifery unit is associated with a higher rate of spontaneous vaginal birth than planning birth in an alongside midwifery unit, and t hese 3 settings are associated with higher rates of spontaneous vaginal birth than planning birth in an obstetric unit Planning birth in an obstetric unit is associated with a higher rate of interventions, such as instrumenta l vaginal birth, caesarean section and episiotomy, compared with planning birth in other settings There are no differences in outcomes for the baby associated with planning birth in any setting.

In addition, the Oregon Public Health Divis ion referenced a report from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) on Planned Home Birth10 as their pub lished criteria for being low - risk. This includes the following requirements: Gestational age 36 weeks and 41 completed weeks of pre gnancy Singleton Vertex position Absence of preexisting or pre gnancy -related maternal disease The ACOG committee opinion references Hutton 2006 and Janssen 2009 as a source for these criter ia. They also note that the low -risk criteria utilized in these two observational studies did not exclude women with a prior cesarean section; however, because of potential risks they state that ACOG \"considers a prior cesarean delivery to be an absolute contraindication to planned home birth\". They also note that studies showing favorable perinatal outcomes ( de Jonge 2009; Hutton 2006; Janssen 2009 ) were conducted in settings that have \"highly integrated health care systems with established criteria and provisions for e mergency intrapartum transport.\" Therefore, ACOG \"bel ieves that the availability of timely transfer and an existing arrangement with a hospital for such transfers is a requirement for consideration of a home birth.\" The final report of the Licensed Direct Entry Midwife (LDM) Staff Advisory Workgroup also rec ommends that planned home birth be limited to patients who are low -risk, defined as pregnancies that do not have any of the following characteristics: Presentation other than cephalic Previous cesarean delivery Gestational age < 36 or > 43 weeks Multiple gestations Diabetes/uncontrolled gestational diabetes or gestational diabetes controlled with medication Preeclampsia Current Oregon law11 outlines risk criteria which birthing centers must follow . A proposed rule would apply those same criteria to home bi rths. Those criteria can be found in Appendix A.

Because this report specifically addresses home birth outcomes in the state of Oregon, a summary is presented here. In 2011, the Oregon Legislature passed House Bill 2380, which required the Oregon Public Health Division to add two questions to the Oregon Birth Certificate to determine planned place of birth and birth attendant, and to report annually on birth outcomes, including death, by location and attendant type. The specific questions were: \"Did you go into labor planning to deliver at home or at a freestanding birthing center? If yes, what was the planned primary attendant type a t the onset of labor?\" In addition, for 2012, the Oregon Public Health Division conducted a special study of deaths in term infants ( 37 weeks' gestation) intended to deliver out -of-hospital. The perinatal fatality analysis includes fetal and early neonat al deaths 37 weeks' estimated gestational age through the first 6 days of life. During 2012, 42,011 live term births occurred in Oregon. Of these 2,021 (4.8%) planned an out -of- hospital birth (home birth or freestanding birthing center). Key findings of term fetal and early neonatal deaths by planned place of birth and planned birth attendant include the following: Sixty -two term ( 37 weeks' gestation) fetal deaths occurred in Oregon during 2012; 4 (6.5%) of these occurred among planned out -of-hospital b irths. Thirty term early neonatal deaths (during the first 6 days of life) occurred in Oregon during 2012; 4 (13.3%) of these occurred among planned out -of-hospital births. In total, 92 term fetal and early neonatal deaths occurred in Oregon during 2012; 8 (8.7%) occurred among planned out -of-hospital births. These 8 deaths underwent a fetal and neonatal mortality case review per published national guidelines. Key findings of the perinatal fatality case review of term births planned to occur out -of-hospita l include the following: Four term fetal and four early neonatal deaths occurred during 2012 among women who planned to deliver out -of-hospital Planned birth attendants: Certified Nurse Midwife (1), Licensed Direct -Entry Midwives (4), Unlicensed Midwife ( 1), Undetermined Licensure Midwife (1), and Naturopathic Physician (1) Median birth weight (3515 grams) Maternal characteristics were similar to the larger group of planned out -of-hospital births Two pregnancies had inadequate or no prenatal care Chart rev iew noted that, among perinatal deaths: o Two pregnancies were twin gestations 36 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 o Four mothers declined prenatal ultrasound (to confirm gestation and identify pathology) o Five mothers declined Group B streptococcal testing (to identify women who are carriers of GBS; treatment during labor is recommended to decrease the risk of early GBS neonatal sepsis) o Two mothers declined prophylaxis during labor for Group B streptococcal positive tests Six of eight transferred to the hospital during labor: o Indications for tran sfer to a hospital from home or birthing center included (multiple causes may apply): loss of fetal heart tones (3), prolonged labor (2), decreased fetal movement (2), and malpresentation (2) o One mother initially declined transfer during labor despite rec ommendation by birth attendant Six of eight pregnancies did not meet published low -risk criteria for out -of-hospital birth*: o More than 41 weeks gestation (4) o Twin gestation (2) o Morbid obesity (> 40 BMI) (1) o Planned attendants among these 6: Certified Nu rse Midwife (1), Licensed Direct -Entry Midwives (3), Unlicensed Midwife (1), and Naturopathic Physician (1) Causes of death and major contributing factors (more than one may apply): o Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy or cardiorespiratory failure (lack of bloo d flow) (3) o Chorioamnionitis (infection in the womb) (3) o Pre-existing or pregnancy -related maternal disease (2) o Respiratory failure (1) o Undetermined, umbilical cord wrapped around neck, large baby (1) o Undetermined, twin gestation, small baby (2) The term perinatal mortality rate for planned out -of-hospital births (4.0/1,000 pregnancies) was nearly twice that of in -hospital births (2.1/1,000). When excluding those pregnancies that did not meet published criteria for being low risk, the perinatal mortality r ate for planned out -of-hospital births is 1.0/1000. EVIDENCE SUMMARY The evidence pertaining to home birth from randomized trials is extremely sparse, limited to just 1 2 participants, and hence an insufficient evidence base from which to draw conclusions. The largest observational studies suggest that home birth results in significantly fewer obstetrical interventions and maternal adverse outcomes. The evidence pertaining to neonatal ou tcomes is less clear; while one 37 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 meta -analysis found an elevated risk of neonatal death, this was not true when the analysis was limited to studies in which the attendant was either a certified midwife or certified nurse midwife. Observational studies condu cted in settings where there are clear criteria for appropriateness of home birth , differing regulatory and training requirements, and systems of care (e.g., Canada, the Netherlands) do not find an elevated neonatal death rate. The NICE guideline's evidenc e review (based on the Birthplace study) found that there is a slightly increased risk of adverse neonatal events for primiparous women, but the NICE panel still suggest eds that these women be eligible for planned home birth after participating in informed decision -making using risk tables. The new search and evidence summary done at the request of the EbGS at the April 2, 2015 meeting found that the absolute risk of perinatal mortality is very low overall, but that there are few U.S. -based studies, that e vidence quality is low at best , and that available studies provide conflicting estimates of perinatal mortality risk. However,an elevated risk of perinatal mortality, particularly among primiparous women, cannot be ruled out by current research . This is in alignment with the findings of the Birthplace study (2011) on which the NICE guideline was based and generally supports that guideline 's conclusions of offering home birth to low -risk women who have participated in informed decision -making. In their first year of reporting, evidence from the State of Oregon Public Health Department identified an elevated risk of perinatal death in pregnancies with a planned home delivery. However, when excluding those pregnancies that did not meet published criteria for be ing low - risk, the rate is not elevated compared to planned hospital births. Criteria for low -risk pregnancy at the time of labor and delivery have been established by national or provincial governments as well as by US national and state provider organiza tions. These criteria have varying levels of detail, but each has criteria for consultation with other providers, indications requiring hospital birth and indications requiring transfer of care. Good outcomes for planned out-of-hospital birth have been demonstrated in several countries. However, these settings have system characteristics that help to maximize safety. Chief among these is a robust system of consultation and referral/transfer that can assure seamless care for the woman and her n ewborn when transfer is needed. In addition, these systems include thorough education (informed consent) of women and families about the potential need for consultation/referral/transfer and the potential risks associated with having a delay to receipt of emergency obstetric and neonatal care. Consideration of distance and time from a hospital able to provide emergency obstetric and neonatal services is important in managing intrapartum complications and in providing fully informed consent . Another characte ristic is written agreements that cover consultation/referral/transfer and a well - defined and practiced system of transfer. Out -of-hospital birth attendants in these systems are appropriately trained and experienced in the identification and management of obstetric and neonatal emergencies, and are also licensed and certified. These providers should be capable of initiating appropriate newborn resuscitation, and be able to provide standard newborn care in addition to the routine postpartum care of women. Ce rtification requirements for the practice of midwifery can vary significantly between the U .S. and other countries, with U .S. requirements for midwives, other than CNM/CMs, generally being less rigorous with regard to both years of formal education and exp erience. 38 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 GRADE -INFORMED FRAMEWORK The HERC develops recommendations by using the concepts of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluat ion (GRADE) system. GRADE is a transparent and structured process for developing and presenting evidence and for carrying out the s teps involved in developing recommendations. There are four elements that determine the strength of a recommendation, as listed in the tabl e below. The HERC reviews the evidence and makes an assessment of each element, which in turn is used to develop the recommendations presented in the coverage guidance box. Balance between desirable and undesirable effects, and quality of evidence, are derived from the evidence presented in this document, while estimated relative costs, values and preferences are assessm ents of the HERC members .

The obstetric indication list is divi ded into six main groups, within which reference is made to the various obstetric and medical disorders and diseases. Where necessary, an explanation is provided about the obstetric policy related to specific indications and upon what the referral policy i s based. The right -hand column shows for each indication who is the most suitable care provider. The main purpose of the indication list is to provide a guide for risk -selection. The primary o bstetric care provider, midwife, or GP is primarily responsible for this risk -selection. The Manuel is a consensus document showing the agreement reached by the professional groups on t heir decision -making structure. Explanation of the codes used for the care providers Code Description Care provider A Primary obstetri c care The responsibility for obstetric care in the situation described is with the primary obstetric care provider. Midwife/G.P. B Consultation situation This is a case of evaluation involving both primary and secondary care. Under the item concerned, the individual situation of the pregnant woman will be evaluated and agreements will be made about the responsibility for Depending on Agreements 45 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 Code Description Care provider obstetric care (see Section 4.5). C Secondary obstetric care This is a situation requiring obstetric care by an obstetrician at secondary level for as long as the disorder continues to exist. Obstetrician D Transferred primary obstetric care Obstetric responsibility remains with the primary care provider, but in this situation it is necessary that birth takes place in a hospital in order to avoid possible transport risk during birth. Midwife/G.P. 1. Pre -existing disorders - non -gynaecological In cases of pre-existing disorders that are relevant to obstetrics, other care providers other than the midwife are regularly involved with care of the pregnant woman. In cases requiring consultation, it is necessary to involve the other care providers in the consulta tion. For this reason, in disorders given code B in this section, attention should be given to collaboration with others outside the field of obstetrics. Attention should be paid to the counselling of women who are considering the possibility of becoming p regnant. 1.1 Epilepsy, without medication A 1.2 Epilepsy, with medication Prenatal diagnostics are recommended in connection with the disorder and its medication. Optimal care requires consultation between all care providers concerned (midwife, G.P, obste trician, neurologist). B 1.3 Subarachnoid haemorrhage, aneurysms Care during puerperium can be at primary level. C 1.4 Multiple sclerosis Depending upon the neurological condition, a complicated delivery and the possibility of urine retention should be taken into account. For optimal care, consultation between all care providers concerned is indicated. B 1.5 Hernia nuclei pulposi This represents a C -situation in cases of a recently suffered HNP or where there are still neurogenic symptoms. It is an A -situation after treated hernia, especially if a previous pregnancy was normal. Both the medical history and the current clinical condition are relevant. A/ C 1.6 Lung function disorder The opinion of the lung specialist should be taken into account during ev aluation. B 46 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 1.7 Asthma Care during pregnancy, birth and puerperium can only take place at a primary level when the asthma involves lengthy symptom -free intervals, whether or not use is made of inhalation therapy. Consultation with the GP/specialist involv ed is recommended. A/ C 1.8 Tuberculosis, active Tuberculosis, non -active In cases of an active tuberculoses process and subsequent treatment, consultation should take place with the physician involved and the obstetrician regarding the clinical condition and care during pregnancy and birth. In cases of non -active tuberculosis, care during pregnancy and birth can take place at a primary level. C A 1.9 HIV-infection As a result of the current possibilities of medical therapy for preventing vertical transmi ssion, these patients should be cared for during pregnancy and birth in a hospital equipped for the treatment of HIV and AIDS. C 1.10 Hepatitis B with positive serology (Hbs -AG+) Since 1988 it is important that a screening programme for this serology is c arried out on pregnant women. A 1.11 Hepatitis C Consultation with the obstetrician and follow -up by the pediatrician is recommended. B 1.12 A heart condition with haemodynamic consequences Pregnancy and birth will have an effect on the pre -existing haemodynamic relationships. A cardiac evaluation is important. C 1.13 Thrombo -embolic process Of importance are the underlying pathology and the presence of a positive family medical history. Pre -conceptual counselling is important. B 1.14 Coagulation di sorders C 1.15 Renal function disorders When there is a disorder in renal function, with or without dialysis, referral to secondary care is recommended. C 1.16 Hypertension Pre-existing hypertension, with or without medication therapy, will require referral to secondary care. Hypertension has been defined by the ISSHP as: A single event of diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or more (Korotkoff IV). Diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or more at two subsequent blood pressure measurements with an in terval of at least 4 hours between the two measurements. A distinction should be drawn between a A/ C 47 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 diastolic blood pressure under 95 mm and a pressure of 95 mm and higher. Extra attention should be paid to a pregnant woman with a diastolic pressure between 9 0 and 95 mm; from 95 mm, referral to secondary care should take place. 1.17 Diabetes mellitus C 1.18 Hyperthyroidism C 1.19 Hypothyroidism In cases of biochemical euthyroid, without antibodies and without medication, or stable on levothyroxine medication, care can take place at a primary level. Where levothyroxine medication is given, specific tests are recommended due to the frequent increase in medication required during pregnancy. B 1.20 Anemia, due to a lack of iron Anemia is defined as Hb< 6.0 mmol that has existed for some time. B 1.21 Anemia, other This includes the haemoglobinopathies. B 1.22 Inflammatory Bowel Disease This includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. C 1.23 System diseases and rare diseases These include rare maternal disorders such as Addison's disease and Cushing's disease. Also included are systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), nodosa, Marfan's syndrome, Raynaud's disease and ot her systemic and rare disorders. C 1.24 Use of hard drugs (heroin, methadone, cocaine, XTC, etc.) Attention should be paid to actual use. A urine test can be useful even in cases of past use in the medical history. The involvement of the pediatrician is i ndicated during the follow -up postpartum. C 1.25 Alcohol abuse The fetal alcohol syndrome is important. The involvement of the pediatrician is indicated during the follow -up postpartum. C 1.26 Psychiatric disorders Care during pregnancy and birth will depend on the severity and extent of the psychiatric disorder. Consultation with the physician in charge is indicated. B 2. Pre -existing gynaecological disorders 2.1 Pelvic floor reconstruction This refers to colpo -suspension following prolapse, fistula and previous rupture. Depending on the cause, the operation technique used and the results achieved, the C 48 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 obstetrician will determine policy regarding the birth. A primary caesarean section or an early primary episiotomy can be considered, to be repaired by the obstetrician. If the chosen policy requires no special measures and no specific operating skill, then care during birth can be at primary level. 2.2 Cervical amputation C Cervical cone biopsy B Cryo - and lis -treatment The practical application of obstetric policy in this field can be worked out in local mutual agreements. If an uncomplicated pregnancy and birth have taken place following cone biopsy then a subsequent pregnancy and birth can take place at primary level. A 2.3 Myomect omy (serous, mucous) Depending on the anatomical relationship, the possibility of a disturbance in the progress of the pregnancy or birth should be taken into account. B 2.4 Abnormalities in cervix cytology (diagnostics, follow -up) There should be differentiation according to obstetric versus gynaecological policy. Gynaecological consultation can be indicated even without obstetric consequences. Participation in national cervical cancer screenings program is not provided pregnant women. The gynaecological follow -up is not an impediment to obstetric care at primary level. B/A 2.5 DES-daughter (untreated and under supervision) There should be a differentiation according to obstetric versus gynecological policy. Gynaecological care re lated to the problems surrounding DES may be necessary, while obstetric care can take place at primary level. B 2.6 IUD in situ B Status following removal of the IUD A 2.7 Status following infertility treatment In practice, the wish of the patient to be cared for at secondary level plays a role here, even though the pregnancy and birth are otherwise normal. There is no question of an increased obstetric risk. A 2.8 Pelvic deformities (trauma, symphysis rupture, rachitis) Consultation should take place at the start of the last trimester. It should be pointed out that care at secondary level has not been shown to have any added value in cases of pelvic instability and symphysis pubis dysfunction. B 2.9 Female circumcision/Female genital mutilation A/B 49 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 Circumcision as such can require extra psychosocial care. Where there are serious anatomical deformities, consultation should take place in the third trimester. 3. Obstetric medical history 3.1 Active blood group incompatibility (Rh, Kell, Duffy, Kid d) C ABO -incompatibility Pregnancy and birth can take place at primary care level in cases of ABO -antagonism, but one should be on the alert for neonatal problems. Consultation is indicated. B 3.2 Pregnancy induced hypertension in the previous pregnancy A Pre-eclampsia in the previous pregnancy B HELLP -syndrome in the previous pregnancy C 3.3 Habitual abortion (3 times) If an abortion should occur again, the need to carry out pathological study of fetal material should be discussed. Genetic counselling prior to pregnancy is also advised. A 3.4 Pre-term birth (<37 weeks) in a previous pregnancy If a normal pregnancy has taken place subsequent to the premature birth, then a further pregnancy can be conducted at primary care level. B 3.5 Cervix insufficiency (and/or Shirodkar -procedure) Secondary level care during pregnancy is indicated up to 37 weeks; with a full term pregnancy, home birth is allowed. If a subsequent pregnancy was normal, then future pregnancies and deliveries can be c onducted at primary care level. C/A 3.6 Placental abruption C 3.7 Forceps or vacuum extraction Evaluation of information from the obstetrical history is important. Documentation showing a case of an uncomplicated assisted birth will lead to the management of the present pregnancy and birth at primary care level. Consultation should take place when no documentation is available or when there are signs of a complicated assisted birth. A/B 3.8 Caesarean section C 3.9 Fetal growth retardation (Ligh t for date) A birth weight of P<2.3 or obvious neonatal hypoglycemia related to fetal growth retardation. C 3.10 Asphyxia Defined as an APGAR score of <7 at 5 minutes. It is important to know whether a pediatrician was consulted because of asphyxia at a p revious birth. B 50 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 3.11 Perinatal death Such an obstetrical history requires consultation. It is also important to know whether there was a normal pregnancy following the perinatal death. Pregnancy and birth can then be conducted at primary care level. B 3.12 Prior child with congenital and/or hereditary disorder It is important to know the nature of the disorder and what diagnostics were carried out at the time. If no disorders can currently be discerned, then further care can be at primary care level. B 3.13 Postpartum haemorrhage as a result of episiotomy A 3.14 Postpartum haemorrhage as a result of cervix rupture (clinically demonstrated) The assumption is that there is a chance of a recurrence; the pregnancy and birth can be conducted at primary care level. The decision can be taken to allow birth to take place in the hospital. D 3.15 Postpartum haemorrhage, other causes (>1000 cc) In view of the chance of a recurrence, although the pregnancy and birth can be conducted at primary care level, the deci sion can be taken to allow birth to take place in the hospital. D 3.16 Manual placenta removal in a previous pregnancy In view of the increased recurrence risk, the next following pregnancy and birth can be cared for at primary care level, with the birth taking place in hospital. When the birth following one in which the manual placenta removal has taken place has had a normal course, a subsequent pregnancy and birth can be cared for at primary level. When in the previous birth a placenta accreta is diagno sed, obstetrical care at secondary level is indicated. D 3.17 4th degree perineal laceration (functional recovery/no functional recovery) If satisfactory functional recovery has been achieved following the 4th degree tear, then pregnancy and birth can be managed at primary care level. The possibility of performing a primary episiotomy during birth should be considered. If secondary repair surgery was necessary, then referral to secondary care is indicated (similarly to that which is stated for pelvic floor reconstruction). If no functional repair has been achieved following a 4th degree tear, then birth should be managed at secondary care level. A/C 3.18 Symphysis pubis dysfunction There is no added value to managing pregnancy or birth at secondary care level in cases with a symphysis pubis dysfunction in the history or with pelvic instability. A 3.19 Postpartum depression There is no added value to managing pregnancy or birth at secondary care level in cases with a p.p.d. in the history. Postpartum depr ession occurs at such a time A 51 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 postpartum that even the puerperium can be cared for at primary care level. 3.20 Postpartum psychosis It is necessary to distinguish whether there is a case of long -term medicine use. It is important to have a psychiatric ev aluation of the severity of the psychosis and the risk of recurrence. A 3.21 Grand multiparty Defined as parity >5. There is no added value to managing a pregnancy and birth at secondary care level. A 3.22 Post -term pregnancy Post -term pregnancy in the obstetrical history has no predictive value for the course of the current pregnancy and birth. A 4. Developed/discovered during pregnancy In this section it is the case that supervision at secondary level care is necessary in situations given the code C, as long as the problem described still exists. If it no longer exists, then the patient can be referred back to primary level care. 4.1 Uncertain duration of pregnancy by amenorrhoea >20 weeks Consultation is required when the duration of pregnancy is uncertain after 20 weeks amenorrhoea. The primary care provider has access to sufficient additional diagnostic tools in the first 20 weeks. B 4.2 Anemia (Hb<6.0 mmol/l) It is important that the nature and the severity of the anemia are analysed during consultation. B 4.3 Recurrent urinary tract infections One can speak of recurrent urinary tract infection when an infection has occurred more than twice. Further analysis of the infection is required. The risk of renal function disorders and the risk of p re-term birth are important. The course of further diagnostics can take place within the local mutual agreements made between the three professional groups. B 4.4 Pyelitis Hospital admission is required for the treatment of pyelitis, so that care will hav e to be at secondary level. After successful treatment of the pyelitis, further care during pregnancy and birth can be at primary level. C 4.5 Toxoplasmosis, diagnostics and therapy Referral to secondary level is required both for diagnostics and for therapeutic policy. C 4.6 Rubella An increased risk of fetal growth retardation, pre -term birth and visual and hearing C 52 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 disorders should be taken into account in a case of primary infection with rubella during pregnancy. 4.7 Cytomegalovirus An increased risk of perinatal death and subsequent morbidity should be taken into account. C 4.8 Herpes genitalis (primary infection) Herpes genitalis (recurrent) During a primary infection there is a (slight) risk of transplacental fetal infection. In the first yea r after the primary infection, there is a higher frequency of recurrences and asymptotic virus excretion. If a primary infection occurs shortly before or during birth, there is an increased risk of neonatal herpes. Due to the possibility of treatment with antiviral drugs, referral to secondary care is indicated for primary infections. For recurrences and where herpes genitalis is in the medical history, it is advisable to carry out a virus culture from the oropharynx of the neonate. If there are frequent recurrences (>1/month) or where there is a recurrence during birth, referral is indicated due to the increased risk of infection of the neonate. It is as yet not clear whether the presence of antibodies are sufficient protection for the child. C A 4.9 Parvo virus infection This infection can lead to fetal anemia and hydrops. Possibilities exist for treating these problems. C 4.10 Varicella/Zoster virus infection This refers to a maternal infection. Primary infection with varicella/zoster virus (chicken pox) during the pregnancy might require treatment of the pregnant woman with VZV -immunoglobulin due to the risk of fetal varicella syndrome. If varicella occurs shortly before birth or early during the puerperium, there is a risk of neonatal infection. Tr eatment of the mother and child with an antiviral drug is sometimes indicated. If there is a case of manifest herpes zoster (shingles), then there is no risk of fetal varicella syndrome. B 4.11 Hepatitis B (Hbs -Ag+) A 4.12 Hepatitis C This is an indication for referral to secondary care for consultation. Attention must be given to follow -up by the pediatrician. B 4.13 Tuberculosis This refers to an active tuberculous process. C 4.14 HIV-infection In connection with the present possibilities of m edical therapy for preventing vertical transmission, care for these patients during pregnancy and birth should take place in a hospital/center equipped to deal with HIV and AIDS. C 53 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 4.15 Syphilis Positive serology and treated A Positive serology and not yet treated B Primary infection Attention should be paid to collaboration between the primary and secondary care providers involved during referral. It is important to ensure perfect information exchange between the midwife, the GP, the obstetrician an d the venereologist. Structural agreements can be worked out in local collaboration. C 4.16 Hernia nuclei pulposi, (slipped disk) occurring during pregnancy Policy should be determined according to complaints and clinical symptoms. Where there are no comp laints, (further) care can take place at primary level. B 4.17 Laparotomy during pregnancy As soon as wound healing has occurred and if the nature of the operation involves no further obstetric risks, care for the pregnant woman can return to primary leve l. During hospitalisation the obstetrician will be involved in the care. If there are no further obstetric consequences then care for the pregnant woman can return to primary level. C 4.18 Cervix cytology PAP III or higher What is important here is that further gynaecological policy (for the purpose of subsequent diagnostics) may be necessary, while the pregnancy and birth can be conducted at primary level. B 4.19 Medicine use What is obviously important here is the effect of drugs on the pregnant woman and the unborn child. Attention should also be paid to the effect on lactation and the effects in the neonatal period. In cases of doubt, consultation should take place. Note: information is available from the NIAD (030 -2971100) and from the teratology cen ter of the RIVM (030 -2742017). A/ B 4.20 Use of hard drugs (heroin, methadone, cocaine, XTC etc.) The severity of the addiction to hard drugs is important here and their effects during pregnancy and birth and in the puerperium, particularly for the neonate . C 4.21 Alcohol abuse This involves the fetal alcohol syndrome. Obviously the long -term involvement of the pediatrician can be necessary during follow up. C 4.22 Psychiatric disorders (neuroses/psychoses) The severity of the psychiatric problems and the opinion of the physician in charge of treatment are important. A/ C 4.24 Hyperemesis gravidarum C 54 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 Referral to secondary care is necessary for treatment of this condition. After recovery the pregnancy and birth can take place at primary care level. 4.24 Ectopic pregnancy C 4.25 Antenatal diagnostics Attention should be given to the presence of a risk for congenital deformities. If no deformities can be found, then further care can take place at primary level. In cases of an age -related indication, direct referral from primary care level to a genetic center can take place. C 4.26 (Suspected) fetal deformities B 4.27 Pre-term rupture 4.28 Diabetes Mellitus (incl. pregnancy diabetes) C 4.29 Pregnancy induced hypertension This refers to hypertension (according to the ISSHP definition, see 1.16) in the second half of pregnancy in a previously normotensive woman. Distinction is drawn between diastolic blood pressure up to 95 mm and blood pressure starting at 95 m m. At a diastolic pressure between 90 and 95 mm, a pregnant woman should receive extra care, from 95 mm upwards, she should be referred to secondary level care. A/ C 4.30 Pre-eclampsia, super combina tion of pregnancy induced hypertension and proteinuria. The latter is defined by an albustix ++ in a urine sample or by a total protein excretion of 30 mg or more during a period of 24 hours. A super -imposed pre -eclampsia exists when there is 'de novo' pro teinuria during a pregnancy in a patient with pre -existing hypertension. The HELLP -syndrome is characterised by the combination of haemolysis, liver function disorder and a decrease in the number of platelets. C 4.31 Blood group incompatibility C 4.32 Thrombosis C 4.33 Coagulation disorders C 4.34 Recurring blood loss prior to 16 weeks B 4.35 Blood loss after 16 weeks After the blood loss has stopped, care can take place at primary care level if no incriminating causes were found. C 4.36 Placental abruption C 4.37 (Evaluation of) negative size -date discrepancy A negative size -date discrepancy exists if the growth of the uterus remains 2 to 4 weeks behind the normal size for the duration of the pregnancy. B 55 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 4.38 (Evaluation of) positive size -date discrepancy B 4.39 Post -term pregnancy This refers to amenorrhoea lasting longer than 294 days. C 4.40 Threat of or actual pre -term birth As soon as there is no longer a threat of pre -term birth, care during the pregnancy and birth can be continued at pr imary care level. B 4.41 Insufficient cervix Once the pregnancy has lasted 37 weeks, further care can take place at primary care level. C 4.42 Symphysis pubis dysfunction (pelvic instability) This refers to complaints that started during the present pregnancy A 4.43 Multiple pregnancy C 4.44 Abnormal presentation at full term (including breech presentation) C 4.45 Failure of head to engage at full term If at full term there is a suspected cephalo -pelvic disproportion, placenta praevia or comparable pathology, consultation is indicated. B 4.46 No prior prenatal care (full term) Attention should be paid to the home situation. The lack of prenatal care can suggest psychosocial problems. This can lead to further consultation and a hospital delivery. A 4.47 Baby up for adoption The prospective adoption often goes hand -in-hand with psychosocial problems. This can lead to further consultation and a hospital delivery. A 4.48 Dead fetus If the mother prefers to give birth at home, the care she receives sho uld be the same as if the birth were to take place in a hospital. Attention should be paid to postmortem examination study and evaluation according to protocol. C 4.49 Obstetrically relevant fibroids (myoma) Depending on the anatomical proportions, the possibility of a disturbance in the progress of pregnancy or birth should be taken into account. B 5. Occurring during birth For the C -category in this section, when one of the items mentioned below occurs, an attempt should still be made to achieve an o ptimal condition for further intrapartum care, whilst referral to secondary care level may be urgent, depending on the situation. When referring from the home situation, the risk of transporting the woman also needs to be included in the considerations. 56 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 5.1 Abnormal presentation of the child What counts here is abnormal presentation and not abnormal position. B 5.2 Signs of fetal distress It is important that fetal distress can be expressed in various ways (fetal heart rate, meconium staining in the amniotic fluid). C 5.3 Intrapartum fetal death Attention should be paid to post -mortem examinations C 5.4 Pre-labour rupture of membranes Referral should take place the morning after the membranes have been broken for 24 hours. C 5.5 Failure to progress in the first stage of labour If the contractions are good, both regarding strength and frequency, but there is no change in the cervix or progress in dilation after the latent phase for duration of 4 hours; one can speak of a failure to progress in labour. Consultation is necessary to be able to determine further treatment based on an analysis of the possible cause. B 5.6 Failure to progress in second stage of labour This exists where there is a lack of pro gress, after a maximum of one hour, in cases with full dilation, ruptured membranes, strong contractions and sufficient maternal effort. C 5.7 Excessive bleeding during birth The degree of bleeding during birth cannot be objectively measured, but needs to be estimated. Excessive loss of blood can be a sign of a serious pathology. C 5.8 Placental abruption C 5.9 Umbilical cord prolaps e C 5.10 (Partial) retained placenta It is not always possible to be sure of the retention of part of the placenta. If there is reasonable cause to doubt, then referral to secondary care should take place C 5.11 Fourth degree perineal laceration C 5.12 Meconium stained amniotic fluid C 5.13 Fever It is obviously important to find out the cause of the fever. In particular, the possibility of an intrauterine infection should be taken into account and the administration of antibiotics intrapartum should be considered. C 5.14 Analgesia It is important to be aware of the effects on dilatation and respiratory depress ion. The use of painkillers during birth is a subject that can be covered during local discussions B 57 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 with the aid of guidelines. One should attempt to achieve well -founded consensus. 5.15 Vulva haematoma Treatment policy is determined according to the com plaints intrapartum and in the early puerperium. C 5.16 Symphyiolysis This refers to rupturing of the symphyseal rupture. It should be distinguished from pelvic instability. The added value of consultation in cases of pelvic instability has not been prove n. B 5.17 Birth with no prior prenatal care A lack of prenatal care can be a sign of psychosocial problems and in particular addiction. Intrapartum monitoring, serological screening and immunisation are of utmost importance. C 6. Occurring during the puerperium 6.1 Puerperal fever It is important to know the underlying cause. In cases of reasonable doubt, referral should be considered. A/C 6.2 (Threat of) eclampsia, (suspected) HELLP -syndrome C 6.3 Thrombosis C 6.4 Psychosis It is important to involve (non -obstetrically) the GP and the psychiatrist in treating the psychiatric disorder. B 6.5 Postpartum haemorrhage C 6.6 Hospitalisation of child It is obviously important here to involve (non -obstetrically) the GP and the pediatrician. The bonding between mother and child are important in the period following birth. C 58 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 Ontario College of Midwives Indications for Mandatory Discussion, Consultation and Transfer of Care (effective January 2015) According to the midwifery model of care, the m idwife works in partnership with the client. As a provider of primary healthcare, the midwife is fully responsible for the clinical assessment, planning and delivery of care for each client. The client remains the primary decision -maker regarding her own care, and that of her newborn. Throughout the antepartum, intrapartum and postpartum periods, clinical situations may arise in which the midwife will need to initiate involvement of other health care providers in the care of a client or her newborn. Accordi ng to the requirements of this Standard, she will: Consult with a physician, or the most appropriate ava ilable health care provider, or Transfer responsibility for primary care to a physician Definitions Consultation with a Physician, or other appropriate health care provider Consultation is an explicit request from a midwife of a physician, or other appropriate health care provider, to give advice on a plan of care and participate in the care as appropri ate. It is the midwife's responsibility to decide when and with whom to consult and to initiate consultations. Consultation may result in the physician, or other health care provider, giving advice, information and/or therapy to the woman/newborn directl y or recommending a plan of care and/or therapy to be carried out by the midwife. After consultation with a physician, the role of most responsible provider either remains with the midwife or is transferred to the consulting physician. Consultation may b e initiated at the client's request. Transfer of Care to a Physician Transfer of care occurs when the primary care responsibilities required for the appropriate care of the client fall outside of the midwife's scope of practice. A transfer of care may be permanent or temporary. When primary care is transferred from the midwife to a physician, the physician assumes full responsibility for the subsequent planning and delivery of care to the client. The client remains the primary decision -maker regarding h er care and the care of her newborn. After a transfer of care has taken place the midwife shall remain involved as a member of the health care team and provide supportive care to the client within the scope of midwifery. If the condition for which the tr ansfer of care was initiated is resolved, the midwife may resume primary responsibility for the care of the mother and/or newborn. 59 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 Midwife's Responsibilities In all instances where another health care provider is required in the care of a midwife's client or her newborn, the midwife shall: Review the Consultation and Transfer of Care Standard with the client as part of an informed choice discussion. Respect t he principles of informed choice, and support the client decision making process. Ensure that a client's decision not to pursue a consultation with another health care provider is clearly documented in the client's health record, in accord with the stand ards of the College of Midwives. Ensure that a client's decision not to follow a consultant's recommendation, once it is communicated to the midwife, is documented in the client's health record, in accord with the standards of the College of Midwives. Invo lve the other health care provider within an appropriate time frame. Ensure that the request for a consultation or transfer of care are both clearly articulated to the other health care provider and the client, and documented in the client's health record .4 Ensure, where possible, that a consultation includes an in -person evaluation of the client or her newborn and that a consultation is initiated by phone where urgency, distance or climatic conditions make an in -person consultation impossible. Ensure th at the subsequent plan of care, including the roles and responsibilities of the primary care providers involved, are communicated to the clinicians, and to the client and documented in the client's health record. Remain accountable for the care they have provided whether working collaboratively or independently. Throughout the course of care other indications not specifically referenced in this Standard may arise which require the involvement of other health care providers. Notwithstanding the indications listed in this Standard, midwives are expected to use their best clinical judgment supported by the highest quality available evidence and relevant guidelines, to determine when the involvement of other health car e practitioners is warranted. Indications : Initial History and Physical Examination Consultation Significant current medical conditions that may affect pregnancy or are exacerbated due to pregnancy Significant use of drugs,

Midwives of British Columbia: Indications for Mandatory Discussion, Consultation and Transfer of Care As a primary caregiver, the midwife is fully responsible for decision -making, together with the client. The midwife is responsible for writing orders and carrying them out or delegating them to an appropriate regulated health professional in accordance with the standards of the College of Midwives. The midwife discu sses care of a client, consults, and/or transfers primary care responsibility according to the Indications for Discussion, Consultation and Transfer of Care. The responsibility to consult with a family physician/general practitioner, obstetrician, pediatri cian, other specialist ph ysician or a nurse practitioner lies with the midwife. It is also the midwife's responsibility to initiate a consultation within an appropriate time period after detecting an indication for consultation. The severity of the conditi on and the availability of a physician will influence these decisions. The College of Midwives expects members to use their professional judgment in making decisions to consult or transfer care. The following list is not exhaustive. Other circumstances may arise where the midwife believes consultation or transfer of care is necessary. The informed choice agreement between the midwife and client should outline the extent of midwifery care, so that the client is aware of the scope and limitations of midwifery care. The midwife should review the Indications for Discussion, Consultation and Transfer of Care with the client. Definitions Discussion with a midwife, a physician, or nurse practitioner It is the midwife's responsibility to initiate a discussion with, or provide information to, another midwife or a physician in order to create an appropriate plan of care. It is also expected that the midwife will conduct regularly scheduled reviews of client charts with her colleagues to assist in planning care. Discuss ion should be documented by the midwife in the client record. Consultation with a physician or a nurse practitioner It is the midwife's responsibility to initiate a consultation in a ccordance with the standards of the College and to communicate clearly to the consultant tha t she is seeking a consultation and why. In requesting a consultation, a midwife uses her profe ssional knowledge of the client and requests the opinion of a physician or nurse practitioner qualified to give advice in the area of clinical concern. A midwife may also seek a consu ltation when another opinion is requested by the client. The midwife must document each consu ltation in the client record in accordance with the standards of the College of Midwives. The midwife should expect the con sultant to addre ss the problem described in the consultation request, conduct an in -person assessment(s) of the client, and promptly communicate findings and recommendations to the clien t and to the referring midwife. Discussion will then normally occur between the midwife a nd the consultant regarding the future plan of care for the client. Where urgency, distance or climatic conditions do not allow t he client to see a physician or nurse practitioner for an in -person consultation visit, the midw ife should seek advice from the consultant by 64 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 phone or other similar means. The consulta nt may use alternative means of commun ication (e.g., via telehealth) to assess the client as available and appropriate. The midwife should document such requests for advice in cli ent records, in accordance with the standards of the College of Midwives, and discuss the advice received with the client. A consultation can involve the physician or nurse pr actitioner providing advice and information, and/or providing therapy to the woma n/newbo rn, or recommending therapy for the woman/newborn to the midwife to provide within her scope of practice. After consultation with a physician or nurse practitioner, primary care of the client and responsibility for decision -making, with the agreemen t of the consultant and the informed consent of the client, may: Continue with the midwife; Be shared between the midwife, nurse practitioner and/or physician; or Be transferred to the physician. Once a consultation has taken place and the consultant' s findings, opinions and recommendations have been communicated to the client and the midwife, the midwife must discuss the consultant's recommendations with the cl ient and ensure that the client understands which health professional will have responsibility fo r primary care. Shared primary care In a shared care arrangement the consultant may be involved in, and responsible for, a discrete area of the client's care, with the midwife maintaining ov erall responsibility within her scope of practice, or vice versa. Areas of involvement in client care and the plan for communication between care providers must be clearly ag reed upon and documented by the midwife and the consultant. It is recommended that one health professional take responsibility for coordinating the client' s care. This arrangement should be clearly communicated to t he client and documented in the records. Responsibility can be transferred temporarily from one health professional to another, or be shared between health professionals, according to the c lient' s best interests and optimal care. Transfer of care or an arrangement for sharing care should be discussed with the client, agreed to between the midwife and the consu ltant(s), and documented in the client record. Shared primary care arrangements may vary depending on community and on the experience and comfort levels of the care providers involved. Midwives who gain more skills and abilities and experience over time may be able to manage more com plex care within their scope of practice in collaborati on with their physician colleagues. Transfer to a physician for primary care When primary care is transferred permanently or temporarily from the midwife to a physician, the physician assumes full responsibility for subsequent decision -making, together with the client. When primary care is transferred to a physician, the midwife may continue to provide supportive care, and any care within her scope of practice that is agreed to by the physician who is in the role of most responsible care provider, and th at has the consent of the client. 65 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 Indications : Initial History and Physical Examination Discussion Adverse socio -economic conditions Age less than 17 years or over 40 years Cigarette smoking Grand multipara (5 or more previous births) History of infant over 4,500 g History of one late miscarriage (after 14 weeks) or pre -term birth History of one low -birth -weight infant History of serious psychological problems Less than 12 months from last delivery to present due date Obesity Poor nutrition Previous ante partum hemorrhage Previous postpartum hemorrhage One documented previous low -segment cesarean section History of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy Known uterine malformations or fibroids History of trauma or sexual abuse Consultation Current medical conditions, for example: cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, endocrine disorders, hepatic disease, neurologic disorders, severe gastrointestinal disease Family history of genetic disorders, hereditary disease or significant congenital anomalies History of cervical cerclage or incompetent cervix History of repeated spontaneous abortions History of more than one late miscarriage or pre -term birth History of more than one low -birth -weight infant History of eclampsia History of significant medical illne ss Previous myomectomy, hysterotomy or cesarean section other than one Documented previous low -segment cesarean section Previous neonatal mortality or stillbirth Rubella during first trimester of pregnancy Significant use of drugs, alcohol or other toxic s ubstances Age less than 14 years History of postpartum hemorrhage requiring transfusion Transfer Any serious medical condition, for example: cardiac or renal disease with failure, or insulin -

GRADE ELEMENT DESCRIPTIONS Strong recommendation In Favor: The subcommittee is confident that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences. Against: The subcommittee is confide nt that the undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the desirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences. Weak recommendation In Favor: The subcommittee concludes that th e desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences, but is not confident. Against: The subcommittee concludes that t he undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the desirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences, but is not confident. Quality or strength of evidence rating ac ross studies for the treatment/outcome18 High: The subcommittee is very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with few or no limitations and the estimate of effect is likely stable. Moderate: The subcommittee is moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with some limit ations or well -performed nonrandomized studies with additional strengths that guard against potential bias and have large estimates of effects. Low: The subcommittee's confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially diffe rent from the estimate of the effect. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with serious limitations or nonrandomized studies without special strengths. Very low: The subcommittee has very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likel y to be substantially different from the estimate of effect. Typical sets of studies are nonrandomized studies with serious limitations or inconsistent results across studies. 18 Includes risk of bias, precision, directness, consistency and publication bias Element Description Balance between desirable and undesirable effects The larger the difference between the desirable and undesirable effects, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted. The narrower the gradient, the higher the likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted Quality of evidence The higher the quality of evidence, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted Resource allocation The higher the costs of an intervention \u2014that is, the greater the resources consumed \u2014the lower the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted Values and preferences The more values and preferences vary, or the greater the uncertainty in values and preferences, the higher the likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted 70 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 APPENDIX C. METHODOLOGY , NEW EVIDENCE SEARCH , AND SUMMARY PROCESS DESCRIPTION 1) Conduct MEDLINE \u00ae search to update and expand on trusted source review conducted in 2014 at initiation of the topic for HERC. Search strategy attached below was developed by an Research Associate for the Center for Evidence -based Policy (Center) and an expe rienced health care librarian at Oregon Health & Science University with extensive experience working on systematic reviews (SRs) . The search was conducted with the following parameters: a. 10-year search (Jan uary 2005 -April 2015) to capture sources that Wax 2010 SR , which was included from initial trusted source search , may have missed or excluded. Search also limited to 10 -year time frame to avoid including studies that were conducted in time periods that now would be considered to be outdated obstetric practice . b. MEDLINE \u00ae search for both SRs (with or without meta -analyses), randomized trials and cohort studies c. Broad search terms encompassing out -of-hospital birth, home birth, and birthing center locations with a variety of outcomes, both in the U .S. and a broad d. Review of included study reference lists and public comments to the HERC to identify any additional studies 2) Dual review by Center epidemiology staff for inclusions & exclusions a. Inclusion criteria : i. Population -based study of relevant patient populati ons in countries with developed health care systems similar to the U.S.; ii. N > 1000 in OOH birth group; iii. Exclusion or control or reporting of patients deemed a priori high -risk by HERC (multiple birth, breech, prior Cesarean birth, non -vertex); iv. Inclusion a nd analysis by planned birth setting; v. Reporting of relevant maternal or fetal/neonatal outcomes; vi. Abstractable data; or vii. Not a narrative review, opinion, comment or letter to the editor. 3) Evidence summary and addendum to HERC Coverage Guidance document based on additional studies meeting inclusion criteria, with quality rating of evidence 4) EbGS to update coverage guidance language, as appropriate, based on updated evidence search and additi onal discussion 71 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 Ovid April Week 3 2015> 1 exp Home Childbirth/ 2152 2 ((plan or (birth$ or born or deliver$) adj7 (house$ or ((away or outsid$) adj3 (hospital$ or facilit$)))).mp.

During full text review of the MEDLINE\u00ae search results, two studie s were excluded as duplicates, four studies d id not have abst ractable data, two were excluded because of country setting and five on the basis of the included population. An additional 20 sources were identified from references in included studies, a final ME DLINE \u00ae update conducted on May 20, 201 5 (21 citations were identifi ed; two were selected for full text review, and one was included), and/ or from public comment and testimony to the HERC. Twelve of these were peer revie wed publications. Of these 12, three were identified in the initial MEDLINE\u00ae search on April 2 2, 2015 and two were identified in the final MED LINE \u00ae search on May 20, 20 15. The remaining nine articles were not specifically on the topic of OOH birth and were submitted as part of public comment related to risk criteria. After full text review of a to tal of 40 studies, 15 met inclusion criteria and were abstracted into Table C1. The authors of two studies (Cheyney, 2014; Janssen, 2009) which had not reported all perinatal mortality outcomes by parity, and which were relevant to Oregon, were contacted for additional data.

Although a PM rate adjusted for lethal congenital anomalies, and breech/twin births was provided, no information given about contribution of other high risk conditions such as these or TOLAC. However, this study likely represents average CPM practice in the U.S. in 2000, where practice is regulated differently across states and not integrated into systems of care. The PM rate is also comparable to that found in other studies. 89 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 Citation Study Description Fetal & Neonatal Outcomes#, + Maternal Outcomes# Study Quality* (GRADE) Comments Breastfeeding Stapleton, 2013 U.S. Retrospective registry -based outc omes study. Data collected for women planning birth center birth in a participating center from 2007 through 2010. Prenatal data collected prospectively using the American Association of Birth Centers (AABC) Uniform Data Set (UDS). Intrapartum, postpartum and neonatal data entered during and after birth. The UDS has been previously validated for data quality and there is ongoing audit for data quality. Seventy -nine (78%) of AABC member birth centers use the UDS registry and approximately 40% of known U.S. birth centers are members of AABC. Most AABC centers have midwifery - led care (both CNM and RM or CPM providers) in collaboration with physicians. Perinatal mortality (stillbirths and neonatal death within 7d.) Fetal deaths 14/15,574 (0.09%) (7 fetal deaths occurred prior to admission in labor and 7 were intrapartum deaths. 4 intrapartum deaths occurred after auscultation of abnormal heart tones and transfer. 3 occurred to women who labored and had unexpected stillbirths.) Neonatal deaths 9/15,560 (0.058%) (2 neonatal deaths were due to known lethal congenital anomalies. 1 was due to a congenital diaphragmatic hernia not detected on 2nd trimester anatomy ultrasound scan. 2 deaths occurred among infants of women who were transferred emergently in labor for non -reassuring fetal heart tones and 1 with rupture of a velamentous cord insertion. 2 births occurred in infants who w ere transferred emergently after birth and had respiratory distress syndrome and 1 in an infant with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy attributed to a prenatal insult.)

It has a large sample size and collected data from a geographically diverse group of centers, including the only AABC accredited birth center in Oregon, over a 4 year period. Birth centers contributing data to the UDS registry may not be similar to those who do not support AABC membership standards and thus the findings may not be generalizable t o all birth centers in the U.S. The care providers make the coding determination for intrapartum data elements such as the urgency of transfer. However, c hart audit indicated that some providers coded a transpo rt as emergent when it was not. Outcomes are not reported by parity. Although TOLAC and breech birth do not meet AABC risk criteria for accredited birth centers there were several women who experience d both in this study. It is not clear where these births took place, but all were admitted in labor to a birth center. 90 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 Citation Study Description Fetal & Neonatal Outcomes#, + Maternal Outcomes# Study Quality* (GRADE) Comments Women are entered into the UDS at first prenatal visit and data is collected through a postpartum visit whi ch generally occurs at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum.

Prior studies had raised questions about the safety of home birth in Australia and in 2001 the provision of home birth services by private midwives was in marked decline due to the collapse of international indemnity insurance. In a 2009 gover nmental national Maternity Services Review, the majority of public submissions related to homebirth, most of these from women who wanted access to the service. In response, the government established publically funded home birth in all states/territories w ith the exception of Queensland. The services operate within the public hospital system. Midwives are accredited, their cases subject to peer review and they engage in emergency training.

HERC GUIDANCE DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK HERC Guidance Development Framework Principles This framework was developed to assist with the decision making process for the Oregon policy -making body, the HERC and its subcommittees. It is a general guide, and must be used in the context of clinical judgment. It is not possible to include all possible scena rios and factors that may influence a policy decision in a graphic format. While this framework provides a general s tructure, factors that may influence decisions that are not captured on the framework include but are not limited to the following: Estimate of the level of risk associated with the treatment, or any alternatives; Which alternatives the treatment should mo st appropriately be compared to; Whether there is a discrete and clear diagnosis; The definition of clinical significance for a particular treatment, and the expected margin of benefit compared to alternativ es; The relative balance of benefit compared to harm; The degree of benefit compared to cost; e.g., if the benefit is small and the cost is large, the committee may make a decisio n different than the algorithm suggests; Specific indications and contraindications that may determine appropriateness; Expec ted values and preferences of patients. 104 Planned out -of-hospital birth DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/1/2015 Planned out-of-hospital birth for low -risk pregnancies Level of Evidence SufficientInsufficient or mixed Similar effectivenessLess effectiveAlternative effective treatment(s) available/accessible1 No Treatment risk compared to no treatment Similar or lessUnknown Treatment is prevalent No YesHERC Guidance Development FrameworkDecision Point Priorities 1.

Question source : Licensed Direct Entry Midwifery workgroup ; Evidence -based Guidelines Subcommittee Issue: The EbGS has approved a draft Coverage Guidance for when coverage is recommended for out of hospital birth. VbBS needs to evaluate application to the Prioritized List of Health Services. Given the concerns about implementation, the subcommittee last time agreed t hat each of the risk factors would need to be addressed, with the exceptions of those for which further clinical or diagnostic assessment would only be necessary if suspicion for these arose (specific with asterisks * these conditions). Proposed List changes: 1) Adopt a new G uideline Note on Planned O ut-of-hospital B irth. Guideline Note XXX PLANNED OUT -OF-HOSPITAL BIRTH Lines 1,2 Planned o ut-of-hospital birth is included on these lines when appropriate risk assessments are performed, and the consultation and transfer criteria are followed, and no high risk coverage exclusion criteria exist. Risk assessment should be done initially when planning the location of birth, and updated throughout pregnancy, labor, and delivery to determine if out -of-hospital birth is still appropriate . The clinical and/or diagnostic assessment of each criterion, with the exception of those marked with an asterisk, is necessary for planned out -of-hospital birth to be included on these lines. ( Criteria marked with an asterisks may not be known or not be pertinent if there is no clinical indication for concern and additional diagnostic testing is not indicated.) An ultrasound is required to rule out certain risk criteria ( e.g. multiple gestation, placenta previa, and life threatening congenital anomalies). Certain risk criteria require serial measurements such as fundal height and blood pressure. If a woman refuses a required clinical or diagnostic assessment, then ascertainment of her risk status is unknowable and she does not meet criteria for coverage for an out -of-hospital birth. Coverage Guidance: Planned o ut-of-hospital birth and Prioritized List 2 Documentation of continuing appropriate risk assessment and routine prenatal care is required. High -risk coverage exclusion criteria: Complications in a previous pregnancy: Maternal surgical history Cesarean section or other hysterotomy Uterine rupture Retained placenta requiring surgical removal Fourth -degree laceration without satisfactory functional recovery Maternal medical history Pre-eclampsia requiring preterm birth Eclampsia HELLP syndrome Fetal and placental Unexplained stillbirth/neonatal death or previous death related to intrapartum difficulty Baby with neonatal encephalopathy Placental abruption with adverse outcome Complications of current pregnancy: Maternal Induction of labor Prelabor rupture of membranes > 24 hours Pre-existing chronic hypertension; Pregnancy -induced hypertension with diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mmHg or systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 mmHg on two consecutive readings taken at least 30 minutes apart Eclampsia or pre -eclampsia Anemia - hemoglobin less than 8.5 g/dL Thrombocytopenia (platelets <100,00 0) Thrombosis/thromboembolism/ or other maternal bleeding disorder * Maternal mental illness requiring inpatient care * Drug or alcohol use with high risk for adverse effects to fetal or maternal health Unknown , or positive, syphilis, HIV, or Hepatitis B status Current active infection of varicella at the time of labor; rubella infection anytime during pregnancy; active infection (outbreak) of genital herpes at the time of labor * Coverage Guidance: Planned o ut-of-hospital birth and Prioritized List 3 Refractory hyperemesis gravidarum * Diabetes, type I or II, uncontrolled gestational diabetes, or gestational diabetes controlled with medication Placental Low lying placenta within 2 cm or less of cervical os at term; placenta Fetal Gestational age - preterm or postdates (defined as gestational age < 37 weeks + 0 days or > 41 weeks + 6 days) Multiple gestation Non -cephalic fetal presentation IUGR (defined as fetal weight less than fifth percentile using ethnically -appropriate growth tables, or concerning reduced growth velocity on ultrasound) * Oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios* Abnormal fetal heart rate/Doppler/surveillance studies Blood group incompatibility with atypical antibodies, or Rh sensitization Molar pregnancy Transfer criteria: If out -of-hospital birth is planned, certain intrapartum and postpartum complications may necessitate transfer to a hospital to meet coverage criteria. For these indications, an attempt should be made to transfer the mother and/or her newborn; however, imminent fetal delivery may delay or preclude actual transfer prior to birth. Maternal Tempe rature 38.0 C Maternal infection (endometritis, UTI, wound, breast) Hemorrhage (hypovolemia, shock, need for transfusion) Retained placenta > 60 minutes Laceration requiring hospital repair (e.g., extensive vaginal, cervical or third - or fourth - degree tr auma) Enlarging hematoma Bladder or rectal dysfunction Fetal and uterine Repetitive or persistent abnormal fetal heart rate pattern Thick meconium staining of amniotic fluid Coverage Guidance: Planned o ut-of-hospital birth and Prioritized List 4 Prolapsed umbilical cord Failure to progress/failure of head to engage in active labor Chorioamnionitis or other serious infection (including toxoplasmosis, rubella, CMV, HIV, etc.) Uterine rupture, inversion or prolapse If the infant is delivered out -of-hospital, the following complications require transfer to a hospital for the out -of-hospital birth to meet coverage criteria: Low Apgar score (< 5 at 5 minutes, < 7 at 10 minutes) Weight less than 5th percentile for gestational age Unexpected significant or life -threatening congenital anomalies Respiratory or cardiac irregularities, cy anosis, pallor Temperature instability, fever, suspected infection or dehydration Hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia unresponsive to treatment Hypotonia, tremors, seizures, hyperirritability Excessive bruising, enlarging cephalohematoma, significant birth trauma Vomiting/diarrhea Consultation criteria: Certain high risk conditions require consultation (by a provider of maternity care who is credentialed to admit and manage pregnancies in a hospital) for coverage of a planned out -of- hospital birth to be recommende d. These complications include (but are not limited to) patients with: Complications in a previous pregnancy: Maternal More than three first trimester spontaneous abortions, or more than one second trimester spontaneous abortion More than one preterm birth, or preterm birth less than 34 weeks 0 days in most recent pregnancy Pre-eclampsia, not requiring preterm birth Cervical insufficiency/prior cerclage Third degree laceration; fourth recovery Perinatal d eath Life-threatening anomalies (unless fatal anomalies with nonresuscitation planned) Postpartum hemorrhage requiring additional pharmacologic treatment or blood transfusion Retained placenta requiring manual removal Coverage Guidance: Planned o ut-of-hospital birth and Prioritized List 5 Fetal Child with congenital and/or hereditary disorder Baby > 4.5 kg or 9 lbs 14 oz Shoulder dystocia, with or without fetal clavicular fracture Unexplained stillbirth/neonatal death or previous death unrelated to intrapartum difficulty Unresolved intrauterine growth res triction (IUGR) or small for gestational age (defined as fetal or birth weight less than fifth percentile using ethnically -appropriate growth tables) Blood group incompatibility , and/or Rh sensitization Complications of current pregnancy: Maternal Inadequ ate prenatal care (defined as less than five prenatal visits or care began in the third trimester) Body mass index at first prenatal visit of greater than 35 kg/m2 History of maternal seizure disorder (excluding eclampsia) Gestational diabetes, diet-controlled Maternal mental illness (with suspicion for psychosis or potential harm to self or infant) under outpatient psychiatric care Maternal anemia with hemoglobin < 10.5 g/dL Third -degree laceration not requiring hospital repair Laparotomy during pregnancy High grade Cervical dysplasia requiring evaluation * Fetal Fetal macrosomia (estimated weight >4.5 kg or 9 lbs 14 oz) Confirmed intrauterine death Family history of genetic/heritable disorders that would impact labor, delivery or newborn care 1 Planned out -of-hospital birth high risk conditions table For VbBS meeting materials 8/13 /2015 Table 1. High risk conditions proposed for additions /deletions /modifications disposition The HERC received many public comments on the list of proposed \"High risk conditions necessitating consultation or transfer.\" It was deemed more suitable that high risk conditions should be divided into separate lists; one encompassing conditions that would indicat e planned hospital birth (or transfer) , the other noting those conditions wh ere consultation would be appropriate to assure the appropriateness of pl anned out of hospital birth. In the table below, conditions that were raised as concerns in public comments are listed to the left. Disposition of these i tems to a list indicating consultation or transfer/ planned hospital birth is noted, and sources cited. Pregnancy Complication (Comment) Consultation required for coverage Planned hospital delivery/transfer to hospital required for coverage Source(s) Recommendation/ Rationale 1 Gestational age of 36 weeks (proposed modification to minimum low -risk criteria) X (preterm, GA <37w0d) NICE guideline Low-risk criteria were clarified. Intention is 36 completed weeks of pregnancy (i.e. 37 weeks + 0 days) as recommended by NICE is requi red to be considered low -risk; therefore any point during 36th week requires transfer. 2 Pregnancy past 41 weeks (proposed modification to minimum low -risk criteria) X (postdates, GA >41w6d ) NICE guideline recommends 41 completed weeks. Oregon Birth Center risk criteria place the upper limit at 43 weeks, or 42 weeks with abnormal non -stress test. Low-risk criteria were clarified. Intention is to be consistent with NICE guidance on completed weeks of pregnancy. Box language was modified t o indicate upper limit is 41 weeks + 6 days. 3 Prior Cesarean section (proposed addition to minimum low -risk criteria) X NICE guideline, Table 6 EbGS agrees that patients with prior Cesarean section are not low -risk for out - of-hospital birth, it is considered an exclusion criteria for OOH birth coverage recommendation . See comment F15, commenter cites two studies. 2 Planned out -of-hospital birth high risk conditions table For VbBS meeting materials 8/13 /2015 Pregnancy Complication (Comment) Consultation required for coverage Planned hospital delivery/transfer to hospital required for coverage Source(s) Recommendation/ Rationale 4 Ultrasound between 12-30 weeks (proposed addition to minimum low -risk criteria) HERC Coverage Guidance on Ultrasound in Pregnancy Not added to low -risk criteria based on previous evidence review finding no change in management of pregnancy based on routine ultrasound. 5 Diabetes, pre-existing or gestational (proposed addition ) X (Gestational, diet - and exercise - controlled only) X (Type I, Type II, uncontrolled gestational, or gestational controlled with medication) Oregon LDM low -risk criteria and birth center absolute risk criteria exclude existing diabetes, uncontrolled GDM or GDM controlled with medication. NICE guideline lists diabetes as an indication for hospital birth. Ontario suggests transfer of care for insulin -requiring diabetics and consultation f or those unresponsive to dietary treatment. Netherlands guidance lists diabetes as indicating secondary -level obstetric care. Previously was incorporated into nonspecific language about maternal disease. EbGS added gestational diet - and exercise -control led diabetes mellitus to consultation and all other types as indications for planned hospital birth. 6 Having had an IUD (proposed addition ) Netherlands lists \"Status following removal of the IUD\" as category A (midwife/GP) Not added to list based on absence of evidence of risk. 3 Planned out -of-hospital birth high risk conditions table For VbBS meeting materials 8/13 /2015 Pregnancy Complication (Comment) Consultation required for coverage Planned hospital delivery/transfer to hospital required for coverage Source(s) Recommendation/ Rationale 7 Extremes of maternal age (proposed addition ; prior box language said age <14) NICE recommends consultation for maternal age > 35 but does not put a lower age limit on home birth. Guidelines from British Columbia specify age less than 17 or over 40 as indication for discussion, and age less than 14 as indication for consultation. Commenters suggest <17 should be an indication for hospital birth, sources only recommend consultation for age less than 14. EbGS decided to strike these recommended criteria for consultation based on lack of evidence that age in of itself is a criterion necessitating consultation in the absence of other factors. 8 Prior third -degree laceration (proposed addition in E2) Prior fourth -degree laceration (proposed deletion in F9) X NICE lists \"Extensive vaginal, cervical, or third - or fourth -degree perineal trauma\" as a consultation indication; Netherlands guidance recommends midwife/GP care if function was restored (category A) and secondary obstetrical care if it was not (category C). EbGS decided to require consultation for third - or fourth degree lacerations, and to require planned hospital birth where function has not been restored after a prior fourth -degree laceration. 4 Planned out -of-hospital birth high risk conditions table For VbBS meeting materials 8/13 /2015 Pregnancy Complication (Comment) Consultation required for coverage Planned hospital delivery/transfer to hospital required for coverage Source(s) Recommendation/ Rationale 9 Intrapartum third - or fourth - degree laceration (proposed deletion in F24) X British Columbia and Ontario list third and fourth degree lacerations as indicating consultation. Netherlands lists fourth -degree laceration as an indication for transfer to secondary obstetrical care. Laceration requiring hospital repair (e.g., extensive vaginal, cervical or third/fourth degree trauma), is included in box language on the list of intrapartum complications requiring transfer. Coverage guidance could be further amended to include third - or fourth - degree laceration not requiring hospital repair as an indication for consultation without transfer 4th degree and 3rd degree requiring hospital repair requires transfer to hospital. 3rd degree not requiring hospital repair requires consultation. 10 Prior fractured clavicle and shoulder dystocia (proposed addition ) X NICE guideline: NICE lists shoulder dystocia as an indication for planned hospital birth. Fetal clavicular fracture would presumably be secondary to dystocia s o we have added clarification. EbGS discussed that definition is challenging and ultimately determined that consultation should be obtained to elicit specific circumstances & severity, and determine likelihood of recurrence. 11 Maternal Jehovah's Witness status (proposed addition ) No evidence sources No evidence was discovered or provided to support inclusion of maternal objection to transfusion as a high -risk condition. EbGS discussed that the reason for transfer would be to obtain blood products, which would be refused by the patient , so this was not added. 5 Planned out -of-hospital birth high risk conditions table For VbBS meeting materials 8/13 /2015 Pregnancy Complication (Comment) Consultation required for coverage Planned hospital delivery/transfer to hospital required for coverage Source(s) Recommendation/ Rationale 12 Maternal seizure disorder/epilepsy (proposed addition ) X Maternal seizure disorder (excluding eclampsia) Netherlands B if medicated NICE guideline indicates transfer regardless of medication status Core sources differ. Medication use may not be a good proxy for risk level, and labor seldom triggers an underlying seizure disorder. EbGS discussed and ultimately decided to require consultation in this condition. 13 Prior infant > 9 lbs (proposed addition ) X (History of baby >4.5kg or 9lb14oz) NICE guideline NICE recommends history of previous baby >4.5kg as an indication for consultation. 14 Suspected macrosomia (proposed addition ) X (Suspected fetal macrosomia EFW >4.5kg or 9 lbs 14 oz) NICE guideline Suspicion of macrosomia in the current pregnancy is also an indication for consultatio n and was therefore also added. 15 Incomplete prenatal testing e.g. strep, STI, GDM (see comment G12) (proposed addition ) X (inadequate prenatal care (defined as less than 5 prenatal visits or care began in the third trimester) X Unknown HIV or Hepatitis B status USPSTF recommends the following screening tests & preventive services for women: screening; syphilis screening; tobacco use counseling NICE recommends screening if mother is willing on booking. Women with inadequate prenatal care face increased risk regardless of birth setting, so this by itself should not exclude home bi rth as an option. EbGS decided that unknown HIV or HBV status should warrant a planned hospital birth, as early interventions could make a difference to the newborn. 16 Severe mental health issues not well - controlled (proposed addition ) X (Maternal mental illness under outpatient X (Maternal mental illness requiring inpatient care) NICE lists \"psychiatric disorder requiring current inpatient care\" as an indication for hospital birth, and \"Under current outpatient Follow more specific NICE guideline. 6 Planned out -of-hospital birth high risk conditions table For VbBS meeting materials 8/13 /2015 Pregnancy Complication (Comment) Consultation required for coverage Planned hospital delivery/transfer to hospital required for coverage Source(s) Recommendation/ Rationale psychiatric care) psychiatr ic care\" as an indication for consultation. Under the Netherlands guidance, psychiatric illness is category B (consultation situation), noting severity and extent of the disorder will determine the best course. 17 Intrapartum or postpartum complications (proposed deletion ) EbGS feels it is important to note intrapartum and postpartum complications of mother and infant that would necessitate transfer to a higher level of care. This does not imply that the serv ices provided by an out of hospital provider who was compliant with the guidance prior to development of a complication, who then transferred the patient(s) appropriately, would not be covered. 18 History of preterm birth (proposed deletion ) X NICE does not list a history of preterm birth as a high -risk indication. A history of preterm birth is listed by Netherlands guidance as category B (consultation situation). Ontario guidance recommends consultation for \"History of more than one preterm birth, o r preterm birth less than 34 weeks 0 days in most recent pregnancy.\" Continue to include certain prior preterm birth s as requiring consultation to be consistent with Netherlands and Ontario guidance. 7 Planned out -of-hospital birth high risk conditions table For VbBS meeting materials 8/13 /2015 Pregnancy Complication (Comment) Consultation required for coverage Planned hospital delivery/transfer to hospital required for coverage Source(s) Recommendation/ Rationale 19 History of more than three first trimester spontaneous abortions, or more than one second trimester spontaneous abortion (proposed deletion ) X Ontario guidance Retain box language including history of spontaneous abortions (i.e. miscarriage) as requiring consultation as taken from the Ontario guidance 20 Failure to progress/ failure of head to engage in active labor (proposed deletion ) X Oregon birth center states this as a reason to transfer. Both the Ontario and Netherlands guidance recommend it as an indication for consultation. EbGS discussed that consultation would result in a recommendation to transfer, so requiring transfer for failure to progress makes more sense. 21 Cervical dysplasia requiring evaluation (proposed deletion ) X Netherlands guidance Retain requirement as recommended by The Netherlands, which lists this as category B (consultation situation). 22 Hyperemesis gravidarum (proposed deletion ) X Hyperemesis requires secondary level care until it is resolved (Netherlands guidance). Ontario and British Columbia also list refractory hyperemesis as an indication for consult. Keep as a transfer criteria, but modify to \"refractory hyperemesis gravidarum\" 23 Family history of genetic/heritable disorders (proposed deletion ) X Guidance from British Columbia lists \"Family history of genetic disorders, hereditary disease or significant congenital anomalies\" as an indication requiring consultation. Retain to follow guidance from British Columbia , because some (but not all) heritable disord ers require hospital care for the neonate in the immediate postpartum period. 8 Planned out -of-hospital birth high risk conditions table For VbBS meeting materials 8/13 /2015 Pregnancy Complication (Comment) Consultation required for coverage Planned hospital delivery/transfer to hospital required for coverage Source(s) Recommendation/ Rationale 24 History of pre - eclampsia/HELLP syndrome (proposed deletion ) X (if did not necessitate preterm birth) X (if necessitated preterm birth) NICE lists history of pre -eclampsia as necessitating individual assessment; and history of pre -eclampsia requiring preterm birth as an indication for planned hospital birth. Netherlands lists prior HELLP syndrome as an indication for secondary care (catego ry C). Commenter requests further refinement if this is to be included (see comment F 10) Box language modified to align with NICE/Netherlands on when consultation vs transfer necessary for history of pre - eclampsia. 25 History of unexplained stillbirth/neonatal death or previous death related to intrapartum difficulty (proposed deletion ) X (unexplained stillbirth/neonatal death or previous death unrelated to intrapartum difficulty) X (unexplained stillbirth/neonatal death or previous death rel ated to intrapartum difficulty) NICE guidance does include \"Unexplained stillbirth/neonatal death or previous death related to intrapartum difficulty\" as a condition indicating planned hospital birth. History of unexplained stillbirth is listed in multiple sources (Netherlands, Ontario, and British Columbia) as requiring consultation. Commenter says this is a broad category best suited to careful evaluation, consultation and informed consent. Gives example of cord accident. (See comment F 11) Retain requir ement of transfer to follow NICE guidance when related to intrapartum difficulty. Consult appropriate for unexplained stillbirth unrelated to intrapartum difficulty. 26 History of postpartum hemorrhage requiring additional treatment or blood transfusion (proposed deletion ) X X NICE guideline This language is being retained as it is taken directly from NICE as an indication for planned hospital birth, however, it is unclear as to what \"additional treatment\" entails; e.g. is intramuscular oxytocin \"additional treatment?\" As there are a variety of possible scenarios, EbGS elected to make it a condition requiring consultation. 9 Planned out -of-hospital birth high risk conditions table For VbBS meeting materials 8/13 /2015 Pregnancy Complication (Comment) Consultation required for coverage Planned hospital delivery/transfer to hospital required for coverage Source(s) Recommendation/ Rationale 27 History of retained placenta requiring manual removal (proposed deletion ) X (if manual removal was required) X (if surgical intervention was required) NICE guideline Commenter says this will exclude women with histories that are not actually clinically concerning for the current pregnancy, and that ultrasound evaluation is the appropriate course of action. However, even with ultrasound evaluation, the patient is at increased risk of undetected abnormal placentation. EbGS accepted expert recommendation to require a hospital birth only if surgical removal was required , and consultation for a history of manual removal . 28 Placenta previa, vasa previa, (Complete placenta previa or low lying placenta within 2 cm or less of the cervical os at term; known vasa previa ) Oregon birth center absolute risk criteria list \"Low -lying placenta within 2 cm or less of cervical os; vasa previa; complete placenta previa\" as prohibiting admission to the birth center.

In addition, \"Dead fetus\" is Netherlands C (requiring secondary obstetric care); however, Ontario guidelines list \"Intrauterine fetal de mise\" as an indication for Commenter expressed that the only risk to the mother is if there are signs of infection or DIC after the passage of significant time, and suggested that families should have home birth as an option after consul tation and informed consent if safe.

Commenter expressed that many larger women are excellent candidates for home birth if other risk factors are absent and recommended allowing home birth after consultation. EbGS decided to make it a requirement for consultation as risks are higher for some women and not for others, such as those that have had a number of uncomplicated prior births 31 Small for gestational age fetus (proposed modification ) X Prior pregnancy with unresolved IUGR or small for gestational age (defined as fetal or birth weight less than fifth percentile using ethnically - appropriate growth tables) X Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) (defined as fetal weight less than fifth percentile using ethnically -appropriate growth tables, or concerning reduced growth velocity on ultrasound) NICE guideline As noted by commenter, NICE specifies < 5th percentile or reduced growth velocity on ultrasound as indicating planned hospital birth. Coverage guidance was edited to clarify this, with additional language to specify ethnically -appropriate growth tables. 32 Fetal growth retardation (proposed modification ) X (also see SGA/IUGR above) X (also see SGA/IUGR above) Has been changed as requested to \"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)\" for consistency. This is an indication for consultation in a prior pregnancy and planned hospital birth in current pregnancy, and is defined as <5%ile using 11 Planned out -of-hospital birth high risk conditions table For VbBS meeting materials 8/13 /2015 Pregnancy Complication (Comment) Consultation required for coverage Planned hospital delivery/transfer to hospital required for coverage Source(s) Recommendation/ Rationale appropriate growth tables. 33 Prelabor rupture of membran es > 24 hours (proposed deletion ) X NICE recommends transfer to obstetric care after \"rupture of membranes more than 24 hours before the onset of established labour.\" Netherlands guidance also recommends secondary obstetric care after 24 hours (category C). Language retained to follow NICE/Netherlands guidance that rupture of membranes >24 hours is indicated for hospital birth . Commenter F said that risk of infection is small after 24 hours especially in home birth setting with minimal vaginal exams and recommends it be included in informed consent. Commenter G suggested > 18 hours as increasing chance for sepsis and necessitating other treatment. 34 Genital herpes (proposed modification ) X (current active infection) NICE guideline Conflicting public comments (any history of genital herpes vs. active.) Guidance language changed to \"Current active infection (outbreak) of genital herpes at the time of labor. \" \"Current active infection of varicella at the time of labor\" in accordance with NICE and to add ress one commenter's concern. Rubella infection anytime during pregnancy. 35 Thick meconium staining of amniotic fluid (proposed deletion ) X Possibly add language about imminent birth. Leave out language Under Oregon birth center ARC, transfer is required for \"Thick meconium -stained amniotic fluid without reassuring Doppler heart tones and birth is not imminent.\" Commenter said this should be considered individually and expressed concern about imminent deliveries. Revise language to include \"Thick 12 Planned out -of-hospital birth high risk conditions table For VbBS meeting materials 8/13 /2015 Pregnancy Complication (Comment) Consultation required for coverage Planned hospital delivery/transfer to hospital required for coverage Source(s) Recommendation/ Rationale about reassuring tones.

Together with the indication about f etal heart rhythm, this matches the Oregon Birth Center ARC. Language about imminent deliveries was added, but not specifically to this indication. 36 Retained placenta (proposed deletion ) X NICE recommends urgent transfer if uterine exploration is necessary. Ontario lists it as a consultation indication. Netherlands category C (secondary care) Commenter says the provider will need to determine safest course based on clinical picture, and this is covered in rule and practice standards. Retained plac enta is an indication for transfer to a hospital, whether or not management by an out -of-hospital provider is initiated before or during transfer. 37 Retained placenta >1 hour (proposed modification ) X (after 60 minutes) Oregon birth center criteria list a 3 - hour cutoff. NICE, Netherlands, Ontario, and British Columbia guidances do not define a time cutoff for retained placenta. NICE defines retained placenta as no delivery within 30 minutes of the birth with active management or within 60 minutes of the birth with physiological management. Original box language recommended transfer for retained placenta without a defined time cutoff. A 60 minute cutoff has been added to coverage guidance to be consistent with birth center criteria. 13 Planned out -of-hospital birth high risk conditions table For VbBS meeting materials 8/13 /2015 Pregnancy Complication (Comment) Consultation required for coverage Planned hospital delivery/transfer to hospital required for coverage Source(s) Recommendation/ Rationale 38 Written trans fer plan needs to be in effect that the accepting OB and pediatrician agree with (proposed addition ) A \"well -defined system of transfer\" is in the document but no longer in the box language. EbGS made a recommendation to HERC to share with appropriate other bodies the concerns raised on this and other related issues that are not addressed in the box coverage language, per say. 39 History of a blood clot, or bleeding disorder (proposed addition ) X (blood clot, or other maternal bleeding disorder) Bleeding or coagulation disorder is Netherlands Category C (secondary obstetric care) and bleeding disorder in the mother is a NICE criterion for planned hospital birth. Alternate language added related to current maternal disorders to follow Netherlands/N ICE criteria. 40 Maternal hemoglobin <11 (proposed modification ) X (Maternal hemoglobin <10.5) X (Maternal hemoglobin <8.5) NICE specifies 8.5 -10.5 as indication for individual assessment. Box language will be modified to reflect 10.5 as cutoff for consultation with 8.5 retained as cutoff for transfer. 41 History of a group B Strep septic infant (proposed addition ) NICE lists \"Risk factors associated with group B streptococcus whereby antibiotics in labour would be recommended\" as indicating birth in an obstetrical unit. No change made as qualified providers in Oregon should administer group B strep prophylaxis outside the hospital setting and so this is not by itself a contraindication to out of hospital birth. 42 Pregnancy -induced hypertension, pre - existing hypertension (proposed modification ) X (Raised diastolic blood pressure over 90 mmHg or raised systolic blood pressure NICE guideline indicates a raised diastolic blood pressure over 90 mmHg or raised systolic blood pressure over 140 mmHg on two consecutive readings taken 30 minutes apart as an indication for Commenter requested that blood pressure > 140/90 befo re or after delivery be added as a risk factor.

Another requested <100,000. The word \"thrombopenia\" has been changed to \"thrombocytopenia\" and a cutoff of 100,000 is being added for consistency with NICE. 44 Chorioamnionitis or other serious infection with fever >38 C (proposed modification ) X No change. Box language presently includes \"chorioamnionitis or other serious infection.\" Maternal temperature is only one piece of the diagnostic criteria for chorioamnionitis. Temperature 38.0 C is a separate transfer criteria. 45 Blood group incompatibility (proposed deletion ) X (with atypical antibodies or Rh sensitization ) NICE lists \"atypical antibodies which carry a risk of haemolytic disease of the newborn\" as indicating birth in an obstetrical unit. Active blood group incompatibility is Netherlands category C (secondary obstetric care). The coverage guidance has been r evised to include \"Blood group incompatibility with atypical antibodies, or Rh sensitization\" as an indication for hospital birth to align with NICE. 46 Substance abuse, including marijuana (proposed addition ) X (routine use of alcohol or marijuana ) X (substance misuse abuse or NICE Table 7 lists both \"Substance misuse\" and \"alcohol dependency requiring assessment or treatment\" There was an extensive discussion about the appropriate language to use to delineate problematic substance use and 15 Planned out -of-hospital birth high risk conditions table For VbBS meeting materials 8/13 /2015 Pregnancy Complication (Comment) Consultation required for coverage Planned hospital delivery/transfer to hospital required for coverage Source(s) Recommendation/ Rationale dependence ) as factors indicating planned hospital birth. Netherlands list \"Use of hard drugs\" as necessitating secondary obste trical care.

Box language has been clarified to emphasize greater than 36 and less than 41 completed we eks of pregnancy, which would encompass EGA 37 weeks 0 days through 41 weeks 6 days, consistent with NICE guidance. Preterm is also a transfer requirement in the coverage guidance so aligning these to be 37 weeks 0 days would be appropriate . 1 2 I don't see either pre -gestational or gestational diabetes on your pregnancy complications list. Certainly both put moms and babies at higher risk than genital herpes. Diabetes (uncontrolled gestational, gestational requiring medication, or pre -existing Type I or Type II) has been added to the list of high -risk coverage exclusion criteria for planned out-of- hospital birth; diet -controlled gestational diabetes has been added to the list of criteria for consultation prior to planned out -of- hospital birth. 5 B 1 I am a licensed midwife, practicing in Portland Oregon in a blended licensed midwife/nurse -midwife practice. We offer prenatal care, home birth and postpartum services to low risk women and strongly desire to include low income women in our client base. Ho wever, I am concerned that the proposed coverage guidelines for out of hospital birth is NOT based on quality research in terms of what constitutes low risk. I am requesting that your committee review the evidence on low risk (see below) and reissue your g uidelines based on unbiased, research. Commenter does not specify which criteria she disagrees with.

NA HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 4 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line C 1 I heard that the HERC is currently taking public comment on what constitutes low - risk for out of hospital birth. I have read the draft recommendations and am concerned about the proposed recommendations because they appear to risk women out for a large number of things that midwives are tr ained and qualified to handle. This is important to me because I am both a home birth midwife and a mother who has (safe, successful) had out of hospital births. I am concerned because I've known women who have chosen to have unassisted births because of similar strict sets of risk criteria. There are many women, who, when denied coverage due to unreasonable risk factors, will refuse to go to a hospital and will then be exposed to greater risks because of a lack of provider at their birth. EbGS bases its decisions on the balance of b enefits and harms according to the best available evidence, while taking into account patient values and preferences and limited resources . We understand that women have strong and highly variable preferences and that this report is a coverage guidance, wh ich defines when home birth should be reimbursed as a safe and effective service. The coverage recommendation language now distinguishes between c omplications requiring consultation and those which require transfer or planned hospital birth , recognizing t hat some conditions require a planned hospital birth or transfer of care, while other risk factors require consultation to evaluate an individual situation and inform the patient's decision and provider's recommendation about where to plan to have her baby . NA C 2 Oregon's licensed midwives and birth centers both have sets of reasonable risk criteria that could be used to define coverage for out of hospital birth. The Midwives Association of Washington State also has a well -researched set of risk criteria that could be used in this situation (http://www.washingtonmidwives.org/documents/MAWS -indications -4.24.08.pdf ). Please consider using these pre -existing s ets of criteria when you consider who to offer coverage to. Oregon birth center risk criteria are included in the guidance document as Appendix A. No reference provided for Oregon licensed midwives risk criteria. Washington criteria are provided in Appendi x 1 of this document. They are similar to the other risk criteria already included. Commenter does not identify which of the proposed criteria she disagrees with. NA D 1 The possibility of VBAC is concerning given that many hospitals, especially in rural areas, cannot even offer VBAC. It would not be acceptable for these hospitals to be back up. And it is concerning that a condition that is too high risk for a hospital would be acceptable to be done at home. Box language already indicated that women with prior Cesarean are not considered low -risk (and thus not candidates for out -of- hospital birth). The coverage recommendation has been modified to clarify the requirement for risk assessment at intake, during prenatal care and during labor and specify high -risk coverage exclusion criteria , consultation criteria and transfer criteria. 3 HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 5 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line D 2 Teen pregnancy is also a higher risk condition Guidelines from British Columbia specify age less than 17 or over 40 as indication for discussion, and age less than 14 as criterion for consultation. EbGS decided to strike these recommended criteria for consultation based on lack of evidence that age in and of itself is a criterion necessitating consultation in the absence of other factors. 7 E 1 Should any of the complications occur at any point in the pregnancy, there should be a re -evaluation to determine the risk/status level; a. Low risk criteria should include an ultrasound between 12 - 30 weeks (standard accepted practice); b. Low risk criteria should include maternal and paternal age parameters such as 18 - 45 years of age; HERC's existing coverage guidance on Ultrasound in Pregnancy reports the fo llowing: \"Routine US in early pregnancy (< 24 weeks) does not change patient management, substantially alter delivery modes, or improve health outcomes, at least not in highresource settings. \" and \"Evidence has not shown routine US in late pregnancy (> 24 weeks) to change patient management, affect delivery mode, or improve health outcomes. \" Not added to low -risk criteria based on previous evidence review finding no change in management of pregnancy based on routine ultrasound. Regarding age, see comment D 2 and disposition . Our evidence sources make no mention of paternal age as a risk factor for planned home birth. Women with inadequate prenatal care face increased risk regardless of birth setting, so this by itself should not exclude out of hospital birth as an option. EbGS decided that unknown HIV or HBV status should warrant a planned hospital birth, as early interventions could make a difference to the newborn. Coverage recommendation has been updated to require risk assessment throughout prenatal and labor period. 4 7 15 HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 6 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line E 2 a.

Complications should include history of large babies (>9 pounds); f. Complications should include 'incomplete prenatal testing' such as strep and all ST Ds g. Complications should include VBACs (we agree with Cascade CCO); and h. Complications should include severe mental health issues not well controlled or addressed; a. There is no evidence supporting history of IUD use as a high -risk condition in pregnancy. \"Status following removal of the IUD\" is Category A in the Netherlands guidelines. b. History of third or fourth --degree laceration in a prior delivery is listed as a criterion for consultation. History of fourth -degree laceration is listed as a criterion for consultation or planned hospital birth depending on whether functional recovery has been achieved (following Netherlands). For laceration requiring hospital repair, see comment F24. Intrapartum third - or fourth -degree laceration requires transfer , unle ss it is a third -degree laceration not requiring hospital repair, (which is an indication for consultation) . c. Shoulder dystocia with or without fetal clavicular fracture in a previous pregnancy is a criterion for consultation . EbGS discussed that defini tion is challenging and ultimately determined that consultation should be obtained to elicit specific circumstances & severity, and determine likelihood of recurrence. d. No evidence is presented by commenter on Jehovah's Witness status. All women giving birth out of hospital should have a full informed consent procedure, including information about what would be done if transfusion is indicated but declined. Personal or cultural objection to transfusion is not found as risk exclusion criterion in other sy stems identified. e. NICE recommends consultation if a prior baby was > 4.5 kg; this appears in our recommendation. f. Inadequate prenatal care is listed as a criterion for consultation . However, because of the risk to the baby, unknown HIV or HBV status is a high -risk coverage exclusion criterion . g. Absence of prior cesarean or other hysterotomy is a minimum criterion for low -risk pregnancy 4 8, 9 10 11 13 15 3 HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 7 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line h. Drug or alcohol use with high risk for adverse effects to fetal or maternal health requires hospital birth Maternal mental illness under outpatient psychiatric care has been added to coverage guidance as requiring consultation prior to planned out -of-hospital birth, consistent with NICE guidance in table 9. Maternal psychiatric illness requiring inpatient care is added as a high -risk coverage exclusion criterion , again consistent with NICE guidance (table 6). 46 E 3 I thought there was criteria regarding specific distance requirements from a hospital that could perform resus citative procedures and emergency C -sections. No such requirement was identified in any of the sources used to generate the risk criteria ; EbGS declines to make coverage recommendation based on distance . NA F 1 I am writing on behalf of th e Oregon Midwifery Council, which represents Direct - Entry Midwives in Oregon, to express my serious concern about the Draft Coverage Guidance on Planned Home Birth. Firstly, I am concerned that the HERC makes only a weak recommendation for the coverage of planned home birth for low risk pregnancies when the evidence is strong that planned home birth with a trained midwife in low risk pregnancies is a safe option for women and babies . Thank you for your comment. \"Weak recommendation\" is a language that comes from the GRADE system and indicates the degree of confidence for a recommendation (see HERC methodology for details.) In this case, because of the potential for bias in the observational studies, the subcommittee elected to make a weak recommendation for coverage of planned out -of- hospital birth. NA F 2 Secondly, many items on the \"High Risk Conditions\" list are completely out of line with the research on the safety of planned home birth with midwives. The list is much longer than is appropriate for coverage guidance for a provider type that is both skilled at, and required by OAR to use, risk assessment, consultation, referral, and transfer of care as needed. The current draft \"high risk\" list would prevent many healthy pregnant women from accessing basic maternity care with the provider type and at the location of their choice. The list of \"high risk exclusion criteria\" was compiled from the trusted sources utilized by the EbGS - the Netherlands, British Columbia, and Ontario guidances as well as the Oregon Birth Center absolute risk criteria. There are situations in which consultation is indicated to address appropriateness for home birth, but transfer to a hospital setting may not be required. The recommendation has been clarified to specify which conditions are high -risk coverage exclusion criteria, criteria for consultation, or criteria for transfer to hos pital care . For some consultation criteria , coverage for out of hospital birth may still be NA HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 8 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line recommended . See revised coverage recommendation language. F 3 The HERC itself identifies the Cochrane Review and the Guidelines on the Care of Healthy Women an d Their Babies During Childbirth of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence as its only two trusted sources in its review of the evidence on planned home birth yet somehow arrives at a different conclusion than either of these sources. The Cochrane Review states clearly that there is no evidence to favor planned hospital or planned home birth for low risk women. In fact the review states, It seems increasingly clear that impatience and easy access to many medical procedures at hospital may lead to i ncreased levels of intervention which in turn may lead to new interventions and finally to unnecessary complications. In a planned home birth assisted by an experienced midwife with collaborative medical back up in case transfer should be necessary these d rawbacks are avoided while the benefit of access to medical intervention when needed is maintained. Increasingly better observational studies suggest that planned hospital birth is not any safer than planned home birth assisted by an experienced midwife wi th collaborative medical back up, but may lead to more interventions and more compli cations. (Olsen, Clausen 2012). This information is correct, quoted from the Plain Language Summary in the Cochrane review (p. 2). The NICE guideline review does review other studies beyond the Cochrane review in mak ing its recommendation as well. This coverage guidance does not favor either planned hospital birth or planned out -of-hospital birth for low risk women. Rather, the coverage guidance recommends that out -of-hospital birth be covered under health plans as a safe and effective option for low risk women, and defines indications which may put a woman and her baby at risk for poor outcomes in a planned or actual out -of- hospital birth based on a review of high -risk cr iteria from other internationally -recognized bodies. NA F 4 Additionally, the NICE guidelines explicitly state that, for low -risk women, out -of- hospital birth is \"particularly suitable for them because the rate of interventions is lower and the outcome fo r the baby is no different compared with an obstetric unit (National Institute for Clinical Excellence 2014).\" The HERC is charged with making an evidence based recommendation and it must remedy this significant departure from that obligation. This inform ation is correct. See comment F 3 above. NA HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 9 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line F 5 While the HERC has identified a number of fully recognized, research based -risks for home birth such as multiple gestation, non -vertex presentation, and pre -existing disease in the mother that negatively impacts pregnancy outcomes (e.g. chronic hypertension), it has also included potential risk factors that are either not based in research or are absolutely not appropriate for inclusion in coverage guidance. Coverage guidance should be based on risks that can be identified at the start of care or upon reassessment at term. It is inappropriate to include emergency occurrences that the midwife could not have foreseen. If these occur, is this guidance asserting that the midwife should not be compensated for al l care before and after the event? This coverage guidance recommends coverage for out -of-hospital birth for women with low risk pregnancies. See comment F 2. NA F 6 In addition, there are far too many risk factors included in this guidance that are outside of accepted guidelines in the US, Canada, and the UK (health systems with which we normally compare ourselves). The HERC Coverage Guidance on Planned Home Birth should only include those risk factors in the \"High Risk\" list that are based in high -quality evidence and are in common usage in comparable health systems that have good outcomes from out -of-hospital midwifery care such as Canada and the UK. The risk factors included in this coverage guidance are all derived directly from the guidelines li sted by the commenter. That said, systems of midwifery care in Canada and the UK are sufficiently distinct from those in the US as to make direct translation impractical. Not all conditions that are amenable to out -of-hospital management in those systems a re appropriate for such in the US. See comment F2. NA F 7 Further, when the HERC creates such a lengthy list of \"high risk\" conditions (beyond those included in a basic absolute risk guideline) that would exclude a patient from coverage for home birth it circumvents the rights of low -income patients to make informed choices about their own health care. This draft \"high risk\" list is not equivalent to recommending against payment for an experimental or medically unnecessary surgery, it is actually a recomm endation against coverage for basic maternity and newborn care for many healthy women experiencing normal pregnancies. Consider, for example, that a woman with a history of genital herpes with no outbreak in the past two years, who has hyperemesis until 14 weeks, but is able to gain weight normally, and has a brother with down syndrome is \"risked\" out three times even though she is a perfectly reasonable candidate for home birth as long as she does not have a herpes outbreak at the time of birth. See commen t F2. NA HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 10 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line F 8 There are a number of items that should be removed from the draft \"High -Risk\" list as they are not research -based and are not included in the high -risk or exclusion criteria from the 2014 Guidelines on the Care of Healthy Women and Their Babies During Childbirth of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, The Indications for Discussion, Consultation, and Transfer of Care from the College of Midwives of British Columbia, or the Consultation and Transfer of Care Guidelines of the Coll ege of Midwives of Ontario, the three main Guidelines that the HERC has reviewed. Many of these items are absolutely appropriate for evaluation and consultation, but to exclude them from coverage is nonsensical because without the evaluation or consultatio n process we can't know if significant risk is found in that particular case. See comment F2 . NA F 9 The following items should be removed from the \"High Risk\" list for the above - stated reasons: Pregnancy past 41 weeks (The NICE guidelines specifically include pregnancy to 41+6 weeks) History of preterm birth History of fourth degree laceration History of more than three first trimester spontaneous abortions, or more than one second trimester spontaneous abortion Failure to progress/ failure of head to engage in active labor Cervical dysplasia requiring evaluation Hyperemesis gravidarum Family history of genetic/ heritable disorders Age < 14 See comment F2 as well as comments about specific criteria below. The r isk factor for post -term pregnancy has been clarified to define low risk as than 41 completed weeks (that is, the cutoff is > 41 weeks, 6 days.) Our recommendation includes history of preterm birth as an criterion for consultation, following the Netherlan ds guidance, which rates it as category B (consultation) History of 4th-deg laceration is listed by Netherlands guidance as category A or C, depending on whether satisfactory function is restored. After discussion, EbGS recommends consultation when there i s a history of third - or fourth -degree laceration in prior pregnancy. The recommendation has been clarified that without functional recovery requires hospital birth, with functional recovery requires consultation. Box language on history of abortions is ta ken from the Ontario guidance (consultation recommended) Failure to progress/engage is taken from the Oregon birth center 2 18 9 19 20 HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 11 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line ARC. Both the Ontario and Netherl ands guidance recommend it as a criterion for consultation . EbGS decided this should be a criterion for transfer, since that would be the purpose of consult . Cervical dysplasia requiring evaluation is Netherlands category B (consultation) Hyperemesis gravidarum is recommended by Netherlands guidance as requiring a higher level of care until resolved. Lang uage was changed to say \"refractory\" hyperemesis gravidarum indicates planned hospital birth . Family history of genetic/heritable disorders is taken from the British Columbia guidance as requiring consultation Age < 14: Please see commen t D2. 21 22 23 7 F 10 Beyond these, there are a number of items that should either be removed from the high -risk list for a variety of reasons or edited for clarity. I have addressed these items individually below: History of Pre-eclampsia/ HELLP syndrome . Of the three guidelines used in the HERC review, only the NICE guidelines do include history of pre -eclampsia but only if preterm birth was required. We know that risk of pre -eclampsia decreases for multiparas and we know tha t pre -eclampsia is a very broad diagnosis. While a history of pre -eclampsia may be a significant risk factor it should be further defined or specified if it is going to be included in the high risk list. For instance \"HELLP syndrome and/or pre -eclampsia re quiring preterm birth.\" All patients will be evaluated for signs of pre -eclampsia in each pregnancy which is the more appropriate ris k assessment tool in this case. NICE lists history of pre -eclampsia as necessitating in dividual assessment (table 8). Pre-eclampsia requiring preterm birth and history of HELLP syndrome in prior pregnancy are high -risk coverage exclusion criteria . Pre -eclampsia not requiring preterm birth is a criterion for consultation prior to planned out of hospital birth. See revised box language. 24 F 11 History of Unexplained stillbirth/neonatal death or previous death related to intrapartum difficulty . This is a broad category that is best suited to careful evaluation, consultation, and informed consent rather than use as a risk for coverage exclusion. There are many cases included in this category that could be History of unexplained stillbirth is listed in multiple sources (NICE, Netherlands, Ontario, and British Columb ia) as requiring consultation. 25 HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 12 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line completely appropriate for a home birth, for instance a history of an intrapartum demise due to a cord accident should not exclude someon e from a subsequent home birth. Additionally a person who had a previous unexplained stillbirth with no other past or current clinical risk factors could be an excellent candidate for home birth with full informed consent about the risks involved and shoul d not face an additional financial hardship as a result of this choice. NICE guidance does include \"Unexplained stillbirth/neonatal death or previous death related to intrapartum difficulty\" as a condition indicating planned hospital birth. Both of these are reflected in the updated box language. If unexplained stillbirth/neonatal death or previous death was related to intrapartum difficulty, planned hospital birth is indicated. Otherwise, consultation is indicated. F 12 History of postpartum hemorrhage requiring additional treatment or blood transfusion. The research is not clear as to whether history of postpa rtum hemorrhage is predictive of future postpartum hemorrhage (Prata 2011). If this item is to be included in the high risk list it should be further clarified so that it relates to truly concerning hemorrhages. A woman who had a 500 cc blood loss and received Pitocin for it (\"further treatment\") would currently be defined as high risk which is not appropriate. Perhaps it could be worded \"Postpartum hemorrhage requiring blood transfusion.\" NICE table 6 lists \"pri mary postpartum hemorrhage requiring additional treatment or blood transfusion \" as an indication for birth at an obstetric unit, and specifies \"additional pharmacologic treatment or blood transfusion.\" As there are a variety of possible scenarios, EbGS dec ided to make this a condition requiring consultation. The Prata 2011 study cited was a prospective cohort conducted in Egypt with 2510 women experiencing singleton pregnancies. There were 93 cases of primary PPH in the cohort. The authors found that \"history of PPH in a previous pregnancy increased the risk of PPH by almost 69 times\" (OR 68.61, p<0.001), although this was based on only seven women with a history of PPH, five of whom had repeat PPH and two of whom did not. 26 F 13 History of retained placenta requiring manual removal. This item is concerning because it may exclude many women with histories that are not actually clinically concerning for the current pregnancy. History of retained placenta may or may not be predictive for future complications and the appropriate clinical course of action is ultrasound e valuation for abnormal implantation. NICE table 6 lists \"retained placenta requiring manual removal in theatre\" as an indication for birth at an obstetric unit. EbGS accepted expert recommendation to require transfer only if surgical removal was necessary , and consultation for history of manual removal. 27 F 14 History of shoulder dystocia . While a history of shoulder dystocia is a risk factor for future births this is an item that should necessitate careful evaluation of the records and current pregnancy course and consultation to determine whether the risk is significant for the current pregnancy rather than immediate denial of coverage See comment E2. 10 HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 13 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line without evaluation. A woman with tightly controlled blood glucose levels in a subsequent pregnancy with a smaller baby is likely, for example, not to experience a repeat complication. F 15 History of cesarean section . The two studies that include significant numbers of out-of-hospital vaginal births after cesareans (where the increased risk of rupture from tocolytics is not a factor as they are outside of scope of practice) showed good outcomes for mothers and babies as long as no other significant risk factors (e.g. breech, twins) were present (Cheyney et al 2014, Stapleton et al 2013). Our recommendation follows NICE table 6, which lists \"Caesarean section\" as a previous complication indicating birth at an obstetric unit. Stapleton et al 2013 is a retrospective cohort study of 15,574 women receiving care in US birth centers from 2007 -2010. There were only 56 TOLACs in this cohort (0.004%), of which 39 (70%) had successful VBAC. Because of the very small sample size, t he authors do not separately analyze out comes by prior cesarean status. Cheney 2014 is a retrospective cohort study of 16,924 women who planned home births in the US between 2004 -2010. This cohort included 1054 women with prior cesarean (0.06%), of whom 91 5 (87%) had successful VBAC. Authors found that TOLAC patients experienced \"an increased risk of intrapartum fetal death, when compared to multiparous women with no prior cesarean (2.85/1000 TOLAC vs 0.66/1000 multiparas without a history of cesarean, P = 0.05)\" and no increase in neonatal death. 3 F 16 Placenta previa, vasa previa, placenta . placenta previa at term as placenta previa in early pregnancy is not relevant and simply requires reevaluation. Low lying placenta should be removed as it is vague, not research -based and is not included in other relevant guidelines NICE table 7 lists \"Placenta praevia\" as a complication of current pregnancy indicating birth at an obstetric unit. Oregon birth center absolute risk criteria list \"Low -lying placenta within 2 cm or less of cervical os; vasa previa; complete placenta previa\" as prohibiting admission to the birth center. Ontario guidelines list vasa previa and asymptomatic placenta prev ia persistent into third trimester as indications for antenatal consultation, and symptomatic previa as an indication for transfer. 28 HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 14 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line Coverage guidance has been edited to specify \" Low lying placenta within 2 cm or less of cervical os at term; placenta previ a, vasa previa \" as ahigh risk exclusion criterion . F 17 Confirmed intrauterine death . This is an odd item to include in the high risk list as it is not a risk for the mother unless there are signs of infection or DIC after the passage of significant t ime. A family who has had a confirmed intrauterine death should have the option to have a home birth covered if they have received informed consent and it is what they want for their care during such a personal and trying process. This is yet another item that should necessitate careful evaluation, consultation, and informed consent but is not a reason for exclusion from coverage . NICE table 7 lists \"Confirmed intrauterine death\" as a complication of current pregnancy indicati ng birth at an obstetric unit. \"Dead fetus\" is Netherlands C (requiring secondary obstetric care); however, Ontario guidelines list \"Intrauterine fetal demise\" as an ind ication for consultation only. Coverage guidance is consistent with the Ontario recommendation, requiring consulta tion to determine risk. 29 F 18 Body mass index at first prenatal visit of greater than 35 kg/m2 . BMI on its own is not appropriate for inclusion in the high risk list. Many larger women are excellent candidates for home birth as long as other risk factors, such as uncontrolled gestational diabetes or limited mobility are not present. This is another item for careful evaluation, consultation, and informed consent, not for exclusion from coverage NICE table 7 lists \"BMI at booking > 35 kg/m2\" as a com plication of current pregnancy indicating birth at an obstetric unit ; EbGS decided to make it a requirement for consultation as risks are higher for some women and not for others, such as those who have had a number of uncomplicated prior births . 30 F 19 Small for gestational age fetus . This item needs to be clarified so that it does not unnecessarily exclude babies who are small but well within normal limits. The NICE guidelines do include this risk factor but specify that they mean less than 5th percent ile. Additionally, if this item is to be included in the high risk list it should be specified that ethnically specific charts should be used so that babies of smaller ethnicities are not erroneously identified. As noted by commenter, NICE specifies < 5%il e or reduced growth velocity on US as indicating planned hospital birth. Coverage guidance was edited to clarify this, with additional language to specify ethnically -appropriate growth tables . 31 32 F 20 Prelabor rupture of membranes > 24 hours. While the risk of infection does seem to increase somewhat after 24 hours of ruptured membranes that risk is still small, especially in the home birth setting and with minimal vaginal exams and other interventions. This should be a matter for the informed consen t of the client within the OARs and practice standards of the provider. Our recommendation follows the Netherlands and NICE sources. Netherlands guidance recommends secondary obstetric care after 24 hours (category C). NICE recommends transfer to obstetri c care after \"rupture of membranes more than 24 hours before the onset of established 33 HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 15 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line labour.\" F 21 Genital herpes. While this is an important risk factor and is already included in the OARs, it is not appropriate for all genital herpes to fall under the high risk list. Both the British Columbia and the Ontario College of Midwives guidelines call for transfer when there is an active herpes outbreak in labor or at rupture of membranes. Many HSV positive women are excellent candidates for homebirth as long as they do not have an outbreak at the time of labor. Guidance language changed to \" active infection (outbreak) of genital herpes \" in accordance with NICE and to address one commenter's concern. 34 F 22 Thick meconium staining of amniotic fluid. While this is a recognized risk factor, this item is more appropriate for rule and practice standard and does not make sense in coverage guidance. Home birth providers will be in situations where they are dealing with thick meconium staining and each case will need to be considered individually by the provider taking into account distance from hospital, if delivery is imminent, and other factors. Our inclusion of thick meconium as a factor requiring transfer is based rating as a Netherlands C (secondary ob stetric care) indication. From the Netherlands guidance: \"When one of the items mentioned below occurs, an attempt should still be made to achieve an optimal condition for further intrapartum care, whilst referral to secondary care may be urgent, dependi ng on the situation. When referring from the home situation, the risk of transporting the woman also needs to be included in the considerations.\" Revise language to include \"Thick meconium staining of amniotic fluid \" as a criterion for transfer. Language about imminent deliveries was added, but not specifically to this criterion . 35 F 23 Retained placenta . This is a strange item to include in coverage guidance because retained placentas do happen and the provider at hand will need to determine what is the safest course of action depending on the clinical picture. There will be cases where the safest course of action will be administration of anti -hemorrhagics and/or attempted manual removal before or during initiation of transport to hospital. This Retained placenta is an indication for transfer to a hospital, whether or not management by an out -of-hospital provider is initiated before or during transfer. Original box language recommended transfer for retained placenta without a defined time cutoff. A 60 minute cutoff has been added to coverage 36 37 HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 16 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line is an i tem that should be, and is, in rule and practice standards but does not make sense for coverage guidance. guidance to be consistent with birth center criteria. NICE recommends urgent transfer if uterine explora tion is necessary. Ontario - consultation indication Netherlands - C (secondary care) F 24 Third or fourth degree, or periuretheral, laceration. This item is confusing for a coverage recommendation especially alongside \"laceration requiring hospital repair\" as third and fourth degree repairs are outside of our scope of practice , but sometimes a physician or nurse -midwife will come do these repairs in the home setting so as not to interrupt the postpartum period. For these reasons this item seems inap propriate for coverage guidance. \"Laceration requiring hospital repair (e.g., extensive vaginal, cervical or third - or fourth -degree trauma) \" is listed in the box language as an intrapartum criterion for transfer to hospital. Third - degree laceration not requiring hospital repair is a criterion for consultation. Third -degree and fourth -degree laceration occurring in a previous pregnancy are listed as high -risk criteria necessitating consultation prior to planned out -of-hospital birth. This is consistent with NICE guidance as found in Table 9: \"Extensive vaginal, cervical, or third - or fourth -degree perineal trauma.\" History of a fourth -degree laceration without satisfactory functional recovery is a criterion for planned hospital birth. 9 8 F 25 Please seriously reconsider the length and scope of the high -risk list. Healthy pregnant women who are covered by the Oregon Health Plan have a right to informed choice of provider type and place of birth. The HERC should be cautious in recommending against coverage for basic maternity and newborn care in healthy women and restrict its recommendations to those conditions that are truly high risk for an out of hospital setting. Coverage guidance has been edited to reflect a distinction between high -risk coverage exclusion criteria , and criteria for consultation or transfer when planning out -of-hospital birth. NA G 1 As chairman of the Midwife Committee for the All Care Health Plan in Grants Pass, Oregon, I am writing to convey our concerns regarding the coverage guidance for planned home birth. Thank you for your comments. NA HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 17 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line G 2 In addition to the concerns detailed below, we ask that a temporary rule change be made to not allow home births until the guidelines can be finalized. In their current state, we feel the guidance violates all aspects of the triple aim. If a bad maternal or fetal outcome occurs during a home birth that could have been prevented by improved guideline s, that decreases the quality of the patient's experience, directly lowers the quality of care, and will substantially increase the cost of care. Therefore, we ask that you seriously consider the additions/changes to the guidelines below. Home birth is cur rently covered by fee -for-service Oregon Health Plan. HERC will review the Coverage Guidance and consider it in making potential changes to the Prioritized List of Health Services for the Oregon Health Plan. Once any changes to the Prioritized List are com plete, rule changes would need to be made. NA G 3 Before getting to those specific details, there are other vital points we ask that you also consider. Need for midwives to have appropriate malpractice insurance. Need for increased litigation protection for OB and Pediatric physicians who take care of failed planned home births and/or their subsequent complications. Patients who refuse to adhere the guidelines needs to sign an informed refusal consent form. All women giving birth out of hospital should ha ve a full informed consent procedure . System characteristics associated with safe out of hospital birth include a system of consultation and referral/transfer that can assure seamless care. Written agreements that cover consultation/referral/transfer and a well- defined and practiced system of transfer are important as noted in the coverage guidance document. 38 G 4 Below are our overall recommendations: Gestational age should be between 37 weeks/ 0 days and 40 weeks/6 days, thereby preventing a preterm or postdates birth. See comment A 1. 1, 2 G 5 Maternal age should be between 18 and 37 years old See comment D 2. 7 G 6 Place of planned home birth should be less than 15 min from the hospital providing obstetrical and pediatric care. Our past experience has proven that transfer plans are poor at best, and significantly contribute to the maternal/fetal morbidity and mortality. See comment E 3. NA G 7 Written transfer plan needs to be in effect t hat the accepting OB and pediatrician agree with. A \"well -defined system of transfer\" is in the document but no longer in the box language as a characteris tic of a successful home birth. 38 HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 18 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line G 8 Increase the current time from 30 to 60 days where an infant stays on open card before being assigned to an appropriate health plan Enrollment issues are outside the scope of this coverage guidance. NA G 9 A first trimester screening should be done with an OB to establish the due date and review maternal history to decide if home birth is a viable option. Other types of maternity care providers, including midwives as well as family physicians, are qualified to assess dating, maternal history, and infectio us disease screening. NA G 10 A 2nd trimester anatomy ultrasound done with an OB to rule out any gross physical abnormalities. See comm ent E 1. 4 G 11 Subsequent revaluation by OB if any complication arises later in pregnancy. Complications of pregnancy necessitating consultation or transfer are listed in the box language. NA G 12 The following labs needs to obtained, as they constitute standard of care: CBC, type and screen, hepatitis B, HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, urine toxicology screen, gestational diabetes screen and repeat CBC at 28 weeks gestational age, and group B Strep screen at 35+ weeks gestational age. See comment E 2 (f). Urine toxicology screening may be appropriate in some patients at higher risk but i s not universally recommended. Some of these labs may not be obtained due to a variety of factors including patient preference. Inadequate prenatal care may be a proxy for measurement, and women may refuse one or more of these tests. NICE says: At the booking appointment, for women who choose to have screening, the following tests should be arranged: blood tests (for checking blood group and rhesus D status and screening for haemoglobinopathies, anaemia, red -cell alloantibodies, hepatitis B virus, HIV, rubella susceptibility and syphilis), ideally before 10 weeks urine tests (to check for proteinuria and screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria) ultrasound scan to determine gestational age using: o crown -rump measurement between 15 HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 19 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line 10 weeks 0 days and 13 weeks 6 days o head circumference if crown -rump length is above 84 millimetres Down's syndrome screening using: o 'combined test' at 11 weeks 0 days to 13 weeks 6 days serum screening test (triple or quadruple) at 15 weeks 0 days to 20 weeks 0 days Then discusses 28 weeks, Etc. EbGS decided that unknown HIV or HBV status should warrant a planned hospital birth, as early interventions could make a difference to the newborn. G 13 Below are our other recommendation that would negate a home birth or require transfer to a hospital: Complications in previous pregnancy/maternal medical history o History of 3rct or 4th degree laceration o History of prior fetal clavicle fracture o History of a blood clot, or bleeding disorder o History of a group B Step septic infant o History of gestational diabetes o History of diabetes mellitus (Type 1or Type 2) o History of prior birth weight 2'.. 9 lbs o Any history of genital herpes Lacerations \u2014see comments F9, F24. Fetal clavicle disorder is Nethe rlands Category C (secondary obstetric care) and bleeding disorder in the mother is a NICE criterion for planned hospital birth. NICE table 6 lists \"Risk factors associated with group B streptococcus whereby antibiotics in labour would be recommended\" as indicating birth in an obstetrical unit. However, qualified providers in Oregon may administer group B strep prophylaxis outside the hospital setting and so this is not by itself a high -risk coverage exclusion criterion for out-of-hospital birth. Diabetes mellitus and gestational diabetes mellitus \u2014see comment A2.

NICE specifies hemoglobin 8.5 -10.5 as indication for individual assessment. Our recommendation specifies 10.5 as a consultation criterion and 8.5 as a high -risk coverage exclusion criterion . Abnormal bleeding is listed as an high-risk coverage exclusion criterion and a transfer criterion , based on Oregon Birth Center Criteria Thrombocytopenia is listed as a high -risk exclusion criterion , based on Oregon Birth Center and NICE criteria. Ontario lists it as an indication for consu ltation. See also comment J4. Fetal macrosomia is added as an criterion for consultation prior to planned home birth Drug or alcohol use with high risk for adverse effects to fetal or maternal health and mental health disorder requiring inpatient care are listed in box language as high -risk coverage exclusion criteria .

G 16 We fully realize the volatile and emotional aspects of home birth. We admit that we have dealt with past disastrous maternal/fetal outcomes, and as such we feel very strongly about this issue. Again, in their current state, we feel the guidelines violate all three aspects of the triple aim. We ask for your consideration for the above details. If we can provide any more information, please feel free to contact us. Thank you for your comments. NA H 1 The Oregon Pediatric Society provides the following public comment regarding Oregon's Home Birth Policy. When home births occur we support the American Academy of Pediatrics Policy Statement on Planned Home Birth: \"The safest setting for a child's birth is a hospital or birthing center, but the AAP recognizes that women and their families may desire a home birth for a variety of reasons. Pediatricians should advise parents who are planning a home birth that AAP and ACOG recommend only midwives who are certified by the American Midwifery Certification Board. There should be at least one person present at the delivery whose primary responsibility is the care of the newborn infant and who has the appropriate training, skills and equipment to perform a full resuscitation o f the infant. All medical equipment, and the telephone, should be tested before the delivery, and the weather should be monitored. A previous arrangement needs to be made with a medical facility to ensure a safe and timely transport in the event of an emer gency. AAP guidelines include warming, a detailed physical exam, monitoring of temperature, heart and respiratory rates, eye prophylaxis, Thank you for your comments and for including the American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement. NA HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 22 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line vitamin K administration, hepatitis B immunization, feeding assessment, hyperbilirubinemia screening and other newborn screening tests. If warranted, infants may also require monitoring for group B streptococcal disease and glucose screening. Comprehensive documentation and follow -up with the child's primary health care provider is essential.\" Although not detailed above, \"other newborn screening tests\" would include newborn blood spot screening as described by the Northwest Regional Newborn Screening Program, pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart disease and newborn hearing screening. H 2 In practice, the manner by which infants are assessed for their candidacy for planned home birth is sometimes of concern. We agree that only those infants who are deemed \"low risk\" be candidates for home birth, but that their candidacy be determined based on widely accepted and complete prenatal care. This includes, but is not limited to a high quality prenatal ultrasound and completed testing for al l routine maternal screenings, including HIV. See comment E 1. 15 H 3 Lastly, we believe the gestational age definitions included in the online report are too permissive. The March of Dimes has initiated successfully the \"Healthy Babies are Worth the Wai t\" campaign to protect against elective birth prior to 39 weeks. This is because a broad literature describes the risks to infants born between 37 and 39 weeks which include respiratory difficulties, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, jaundice, feeding difficultie s, learning challenges, and even death. We do not support planned home birth for infants < 37 weeks. See comment A 1. The literature referenced here applies primarily to non - spontaneous labor occurring prior to 37 weeks' gestation. Coverage recommendation on gestational age has been modified to 37 weeks 0 days through 41 weeks 6 days. 1, 2 I 1 This is to register my great concern on the HERC's guidelines on planned homebirth in Oregon. I have read the proposed guidelines and do not think these are in th e best interest of childbearing women in Oregon. Although it is vital to understand and to educate that certain very high -risk Thank you for your comments. NA HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 23 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line pregnancies will be better served in the hospital, using these (proposed) guidelines, in many cases, would rule out basic choice in basic maternity and newborn care for HEALTHY WOMEN WHO ARE EXPERIENCING NORMAL PREGNANCIES. Licensed midwives in Oregon work under risk assessment guidelines which are evidence -based and we continually assess and reassess women to evaluate who may need a consult with an MD or OB or other specialist and who may be too high risk for out of hospital birth. I 2 I have read [commenter F]'s letter to HERC on behalf of the Oregon Midwifery Council, and must say that I agree with [their] very specific comments, point by point, and I would refer you to that letter rather than renaming those points here. [Their} statements are a reflection of [their] extensive experience as a midwife and as an ardent researcher in the maternity care literature. As per [commenter F]'s letter, I agree that apparently, the HERC has identified certain risks for home birth that are truly research -based but has includ ed as well many potential risk factors that are NOT based in research or that have no reason to be included in guidance for coverage. These items need to be addressed and hopefully removed from the list so that the HERC guidelines can be considered to have integrity and to be actually true to the task of providing \"Evidence Based Recommendations.\" From my own limited experience as a midwife (>400 births) I can say that I have helped women with each of ( [commenter F]'s named) risk factors and have had good o utcomes. Risk assessment is an ongoing task for the midwife throughout the prenatal and birth and postnatal period, so that each woman and baby are assured the best outcomes. See comments C 1, C2, and F 2. NA J 1 The ingredients necessary for good ou tcome s in out of hospital (OOH) births are not a secret. The literature shows that you need well -trained midwives, good transfer policies, and appropriate candidate selection. I agree with your concept of adopting coverage guidelines for Oregon that Thank you for your comments. 38 HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 24 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line incorporate the risk criteria used in Canada, UK, and the Netherlands. J 2 I have a few suggestions for changes in the wording that I think would improve the draft. \"Planned Home Birth\" should be changed back to \"Planned Out -of-hospital birth.\" The coverage guidelines should pertain to all OOH births, both home and birth center. In Oregon, many birth attendants work both in birth centers and also do home births. Birth centers do not provide any additional safety features over home birth for high risk situations. The current birth center rules exclude twins and breech, but allow Previous C -section, postterm pregnancies up to 43 weeks, and hypertension up to 150/100 . I think it is already confusing to the consumer that there are two sets of rules - one for LDMs through the BDEM, and another for Birth Centers. I think it would compound the confusion to have two sets of coverage guidelines. The Licensed Direct Entry M idwife Staff Advisory Workgroup specifically requested the HERC to develop a coverage guidance related to planned home birth. The primary source (NICE) groups home birth and freestanding or alongside midwifery -led units as appropriate choices for low -risk women. In light of this, we have changed the title to \"Planned out -of- hospital birth.\" It is appropriate to have a single set of criteria pertaining to all types of out of hospital births. NA J 3 In my view, \"High risk conditions necessitating consultation or transfer include.....\" should be changed to \"High risk conditions necessitating transfer to a hospital provider include.........\" In Canada, the UK, and the Netherlands, the licensed midwives have admitting privileges to hospitals. The criteria for consultation and transfer apply to women who labo r both in and out of hospitals. There are some patients who have high risk conditions that make them inappropriate candidates for OOH births, but whose labors can still be attended by midwives in the hospital in consultation with a physician. In Oregon, the vast majority of midwiv es who attend OOH births do not have hospital privileges, so high risk clients should be transferred to a provider with hospital privileges. Currently, Oregon rules for LDMs regarding consultations for high risk Coverage guidance has been edited to reflect a distinction between exclusion criteria for coverage of planned out-of-hospital birth, and those that necessitate antepartum consultation with a provider who has expertise in caring for higher risk pr egnancies and when planning out of hospital birth and the ability to admit to a hospital. See also comment F2 and revised coverage recommendations. NA HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 25 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line clients, OAR 332 -025-0021 (7) and (8), do not require that the consultation be with a physici an with hospital privileges. The consultation can be with a physician, a PA, a CNM, a Naturopath, or another LDM with \"direct experience\". I believe the word \"consultation\" in your draft should be removed. J 4 I would recommend more precise definitions of certain risk criteria to avoid confusion. There are some discrepancies between the LDM rules, the birth center rules, and standard definitions in the medical literature. My suggestions are: a. \"Fetal growth retardation\" should be changed to \"Eclampsia, pre -eclampsia or pregn ancy -induced hypertension, hypertension (before or after delivery) with blood pressure >140/90.\" Both ACOG and SOGC use a systolic of 140 or a diastolic of 90 to define gestational hypertension. (1,2) NICE (p. 30) recommends transfer to obstetric care for \"either raised diastolic blood pressure (over 90 mmHg) or raised systolic blood pressure (over 140 mm Hg) on 2 consecutive readings taken 30 minutes apart.\" c. \"Chorioamnionitis or other serious infection with fever > 38 C.\" Three out of the eight OOH fetal/ neonatal deaths in Oregon in 2012 had chorioamnionitis. d. \"Thrombopenia\" should be changed to \"Thrombocytopenia with platelets <100,000.\" e. \"Uteroplacental Insufficiency hour.\" a. \"Fetal growth retardation\" language was taken from the Netherlands guidance and has been changed to \"Intrauterine growth restriction\" for consistency. b. Box language has been edited to reflect NICE cutoffs for hypertension as a criterion for transfer. c. Box language presently includes \"chorioamnionitis or other serious infection\" and t emperature 38.0 C as separate transfer criteria. Maternal temperature is only one piece of the diagnostic criteria for chorioamnionitis. d. The word \"thrombope nia\" has been changed to \"thrombocytopenia\" for consistency. NICE table 6 does include cutoff of 100,000. e. \"Uteroplacental insufficiency\" and \"Intrauterine growth restriction\" are presently listed separately in the box language. f. Box language recommends tr ansfer for retained placenta without a defined time cutoff. Oregon birth center criteria list a 3 -hour cutoff. Netherlands, Ontario, and British Columbia guidances do not define a time cutoff for retained placenta. A sixty -minute cutoff has been added to coverage guidance to be consistent with NICE. 31 42 44 43 32 37 J 5 I think \"failure to progress\" also needs to be defined. Two out of the eight OOH fetal/neonatal deaths in Oregon in 2012 had prolonged labor. Some options: a. The Dutch criteria for failure to progress in the first stage of active The definitions in a. through d. are correct. The box language does not presently include a definition of delay of labor.

Failure to progress in the second stage of labor is \"lack of progress after a maximum of one hour, in cases with full dilation, ruptured membranes, strong contractions and sufficient maternal effort.\" b. NICE (p. 57) states that delay in the first stage of active labor is suspected if cervical dilatation is less than 2 cm in 4 hours. Diagnosis of delay in the active second stage (p. 60) is after 2 hours for nulliparous woman and one hour for multiparous woman. c. ACOG recently defined arrest of labor in the first stage of labor as no cervical change in 4 hours of adequate contractions or 6 hours of inadequate contractions. In the second stage, 2 hours of pushing in multiparous women and 3 hours in nulliparous women.(3) d.

My preference is a hybrid: First stage - no change in the cervix or progress in dilation after the latent phase for a duration of 4 hours.

J 6 For Postpartum complications, \"Transfer to a higher level of care is recommended in the following circumstances:\" should be changed to \"The following post -partum complications require transfer to a hospital:\" Thank you for the suggestion. See revised box language. NA J 7 I agree that Previous Cesarean Section is a situation that should remain on the high risk list.

(4) OOH births use intermittent auscultation for fetal surveillance which is appropriate for low risk labors if done properly, but is not appropriate for VBACs. Quoting from the SO GC guidelines for intrapartum fetal surveillance: \"For women attempting VBAC, there is little controversy. All professional jurisdictions recommend continuous electronic fetal monitoring.\" That includes ACOG, SOGC, and RCOG. (5) K 1 My name is [commenter K] and I am a licensed Registered Nurse in the state of Oregon. I have had the choice and privilege to birth my three children safely and gently at home over the past several years. I am pleased that you have put forth a great effort to lay out guidelines for women in Oregon who want more comprehensive choices in their prenatal care and birth experiences. I am also thankful that these choices will be more readily available to women on OHP and related health insurances. I am concerned, however, with some of the restrictions placed in the proposed guidelines, and fear that some of them may inappropriately hinder otherwise healthy candidates for home births with safe outcomes. Some of the proposed restrictions on what is defin ed as \"high risk\" pregnancy fail to take into consideration individual situations and the possibility of individualized care rather than providing \"blanket labels\" on what is or isn't \"safe enough.\" Thank you for your comments. NA K 2 My firstborn was b orn at 41 weeks and 2 days; 2 days beyond your recommended 36-41 week window, and I had a safe birth and healthy and safe outcomes for my child and myself. I understand that it is not uncommon for first births to be as much as 10 days late, give or take, w ith no adverse outcomes. I took care to monitor en - utero activity on a daily basis, as recommended both by my midwives, and also by literature I had received from an OB clinic before my transfer of care to a midwife team. Thank you for sharing your experie nce. Cutoff of 41 weeks is endorsed by ACOG. NICE does include pregnancy up to 41 completed weeks, or 41 weeks+ 6 days. The coverage guidance language uses 41 completed weeks of gestation which comports with the NICE definition. 2 K 3 According to a simp le calculator, I have a BMI over 35, but you would never guess that just looking at me. Just a few years ago, I was 5ft 6in and 180lb. (BMI about 30), but I was fit enough to run a 10K in one hour, thin enough to count all my ribs in the NICE table 7 lists \" Body mass index at booking of greater than 35 kg/m2\"as indicating increased risk, suggesting planned hospital 30 HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 28 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line mirror, and lean e nough to not be able to float in a pool to save my life. (I'd sink like a rock without actively swimming...it was impossible for me to do a dead -mans - float.) I had a flat stomach, and I ran a couple miles every day...but the BMI chart said I was overweight . Now, a little heavier and a little less active, I'm actually at just over a BMI of 35, but I'm still active, still healthy, have low cholesterol, and no indicators of diabetes, pre -diabetes, or high blood pressure. The typical BMI scale and chart doesn't accurately reflect my health status, but through an objective lens, a well -trained care provider would tell you that I'm a little overweight, but otherwise healthy. I know I'm not the only person like this. There are other women out there who are predisp osed to higher muscle mass, whether genetically and/or through training. A BMI chart should be a tool in the overall evaluation of a candidate, not a defining point in whether or not services can or cannot be provided. birth. EbGS decided to make it a criterion for consultation as risks are higher for some women and not for others, such as those that have had a number of uncomplicated prior births . K 4 I also have O - (RH negative) blood, and my husband has the Rh factor (Rh+), and all my children were consequently born with Rh+ blood, but I have had safe and healthy outcomes in all my pregnancies and births. My trained midwives were attentive to my needs and I had regular lab draws to monitor for any adverse reactions. A trained midwife is still a trained healthcare provider, and should be treated as such. Everything I was told that I would have available to me in the O B setting, I still had available to me in the midwife/home -birth setting of my care (Rhogam shots, appropriate and recommended lab draws, regular urine screening, blood glucose screening, newborn hearing screening, newborn lab draws, etc.) Active blood gro up incompatibility is Netherlands category C (secondary obstetric care). NICE also lists \"atypical antibodies which carry a risk of haemolytic disease of the newborn\" as indicating birth in an obstetrical unit. The coverage guidance has been revised to inc lude \"Blood group incompatibili ty with atypical antibodies, or Rh sensitization\" as a high risk coverage exclusion criterion for hospital birth to align with NICE. 45 K 5 As a trained healthcare provider myself, I see great potential in allowing women a better spectrum of choices in their prenatal and birthing experience. From firsthand experience, my care has been infinitely better and more comprehensive with a team of midwives versus a trained OB. For one, a typical OB visit is 15 minutes and they don't have the time or availability to provide holistic care to their clients. Their agenda is compressed into a \"one -size-fits-all/most\" model of the pregnancy process and they miss much opportunity to address specific points or concerns related to the individ ual woman. Consequently, if problems arise (even minor ones), Thank you for your comments. NA HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 29 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line the OB is forced to be reactive to the situation rather than proactive before the issue arises. K 6 With a midwife as the trained provider, the average prenata l visit is one hour, and each visit is tailored to the individual woman and her pregnancy experience. In- depth discussions are focused on things like diet, rest and exercise, new or ongoing stressors in the mother -to-be's life, etc. and all of which may ha ve a direct impact on the pregnancy and/or birthing experience. More time is also afforded to discuss various treatment plans and options that relate to the individual woman and her preferences. Skilled midwives, therefore, have more of an ability to be pr oactive in a woman's care and to address potential risks before they start or get out of hand. In this sense, having a trained midwife can be viewed as choosing a more prophylactic route to a positive pregnancy and birth outcome. Thank you for your comment s. NA K 7 A skilled midwife, like a skilled OB, will have the client's best interest in mind, and will transfer care to a more skilled group if the situation necessitates. Just like an OB may transfer care of a high -risk patient to a more skillfully trai ned OB or specialist, or refer a woman to a more acute facility (Hospital instead of a birthing facility, or higher level hospital instead of community hospital), a midwife also has the ability and duty to refer a client to a more skilled professional or f acility if the situation exceeds her scope of care. Autonomy should not be stripped from a trained and skilled provider. I think the stringency of the gui delines in the proposal should be modified so that trained and licensed midwives can still practice wi thin the scope of what they were trained. Even VBAC's and Breach births can have healthy and safe outcomes at home if attended by a skilled midwife. And sometimes less intervention is more as far as quality of care and outcome. See comment C 1. NA L 1 I am not sure if or how this information will be of use to you, but HERC should know these things. The HERC draft greatly understates the mortality difference between planned It is true, as the commenter states, that the data we cite may group pre -labor fetal death with intrapartum death and that some hospital deliveries where there was pre -labor fetal death may have been originally planned as o ut-of-hospital births. However, it is NA HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 30 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line hospital births and planned out -of-hospital (OOH) births in Oregon in 2012. The report on 2012 Oregon births by planned birth place (1) and HERC draft both say that \"The term perinatal mortality rate for planned OOH birth (4.0/1,000 pregnancies) was nearly twice that of in -hospital births (2.1/1,000)\" (1). That is true, but the co mparison is misleading because the perinatal mortality rate for planned hospital births included an unknown but relatively large number of antepartum (AP) fetal deaths that occurred before the mother was in labor. Eighty -five to 90 percent of all fetal dea ths in developed countries are stillbirths prior to labor (2), and the incidence increases with gestational age (3) and thus is highest among term births. Most women whose babies die before labor go to a hospital to have labor induced and deliver their d ead fetus in the hospital. In contrast to antepartum fetal deaths, intrapartum (IP) fetal deaths during labor are very rare in hospitals in developed countries, only about 1 per 10,000 births (4). There were no intrapartum fetal deaths in a prospective 19 80s study of almost 35,000 hospital births using either selective (for high -risk pregnancies) or universal electronic fetal monitoring (5). Antepartum fetal deaths comprise the vast majority of all fetal deaths that occur in American hospitals. Fifty -eigh t term fetal deaths were associated with 39,990 planned hospital births in Oregon in 2012 (1). We don't know how many were IP, but it is highly unlikely that more than six fetal deaths occurred during labor in Oregon hospitals that year. Four intrapartum f etal deaths were associated with planned OOH births in Oregon in 2012. All four were investigated by a public health pediatrician; all of them were intrapartum. It is misleading to compare a perinatal mortality rate that included an unknown but relatively high proportion of the 58 term fetal deaths associated with nearly 40,000 planned hospital births in Oregon in 2012 with the perinatal mortality rate for planned 2,021 planned OOH births, which included 4 early neonatal deaths and 4 intrapartum fetal death s but no antenatal fetal deaths. also true that chart review of the eight term fetal deaths and early neonatal deaths from the Oregon birth study shows that six of these deaths would not have met the criteria for coverage as outlined in this coverage guidance. The 2012 Oregon mortality rate, when adjusted for risk factors that should have excluded women from attempting OOH birth (and which this coverage guidance does not support ) lies within the range of rates seen in the international and U.S. literat ure for both OOH and low -risk hospital births. HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 31 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line L 2 The draft Guidance does not address the educational qualifications of home -birth attendants in Oregon. The reviewed evidence is based primarily on studies from the Netherlands, Ontario and British Columbia. All midwives who attend home births in those jurisdictions are educated to the standards in the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) Definition of the Midwife (6) and Global Standards for Basic Midwifery Education (7), as are all certified nurse -midwives (CNMs) in the United States (US). ICM defines a \"midwife\" in part as a person who has completed a three -year midwifery education program, or 18 months for students who enter as nurses or other healthcare professionals (6,7). In contrast to home births in those jurisdictions, most OOH births in Oregon are attended by direct entry midwives (DEMs), naturopaths and others with less midwifery educatio n. In 2012, 62 percent of all planned out -of-hospital (OOH) births were attended by DEMs, 25 percent by CNMs, 11 percent by naturopaths (1). DEMs are limited to OOH births. Although some are knowledgeable and competent, some aren't; very few have complet ed a midwifery curriculum that meets ICM standards. Most, including certified professional midwives (CPMs), are trained through apprenticeship and self -study (8,9). Most naturopaths who attend births in Oregon graduated from the National College of Naturop athic Medicine (NCNM) in Portland. One three -credit lecture course in natural childbirth is part of the curriculum for all naturopathic physicians (10). NCNM also offers four three -credit lecture courses, one each on pregnancy, labor and birth, the postpar tum period, and neonatology. Films are used to enhance lectures on techniques for monitoring the fetal/maternal condition and progress of labor, complications of labor and birth are discussed and skills needed to respond to them are demonstrated. Although NCNM does not provide any supervised clinical experience with pregnant women (10), to be licensed in Oregon naturopaths must have observed and assisted in 50 births supervised by a naturopath or obstetrician, pass a test and complete 15 hours of continuing education every year (11). Thank you for your comment and information. Oregon law allows practice by midwives and other providers who do not have ICM standards of education. The draft guidance states \"Certification requirements for the practice of midwifery vary significantly betwee n the US and other countries, with US requirements being less rigorous with regard to both years of formal education and experience. See also comment F 6. Box language requires home birth providers to be certified and licensed. NA HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 32 ID # Comment Disposition High- Risk Table Line CNMs attended only 25 percent of all planned OOH births in Oregon in 2012. All CNMs are educated to ICM standards in masters' degree programs, including one at OHSU. The IP fetal death rates from studies of home births attended by midwives who meet ICM education standards were zero in the small study from British Columbia, 0.31/1000 births in the very large study from the Netherlands, 0.45 in Ontario, and 0.36/1000 in England (12,13). In comparison the rate was 1.3 in a 2014 stu dy of nearly 17,000 home births attended by members of the Midwives Alliance of North America (MANA) (14), four times higher than the mean rate if findings from all four of the ICM -education standard studies were combined. Eighty -five percent of births in the MANA study were attended by midwives who don't meet ICM education standards (15). The Ontario study reported total neonatal mortality (NN) instead of early NN mortality. ENN is preferable and was reported by the other three studies. The IP+NN rate for the Ontario study was 1.35/1000 births and 2.07/1000 for the MANA study. The IP+ENN mortality rates for the studies from British Columbia, the Netherlands and England were 0.35, 0.64 and 0.65 respectively. At 1.71/1000, the IP+ENN morality rate for the MAN A study (14) was more than three times higher than the average for the studies based on births attended by midwives who meet ICM education standards. Intermittent auscultation is used to monitor the fetal heart rate in OOH births (15). It requires concentrated attention and a deep understanding of fetal heart rate changes and their significance during labor. Home birth midwives must be proficient in intermittent auscultation. L 3 HERC should add dist ance or time (not more than 30 minutes) from the home -birth residence to a hospital staffed and equipped to provide emergency care to a parturient woman or newborn to the criteria for coverage.

Trillium Community health Plan would like to provide a list of additional guidelines to consider when drafting coverage guidance. Should complications occur at any point in the pregnancy, a re -evaluation should be performed to determine risk/status level. Low risk characteristics should include an ultrasound between 12 - 30 weeks. Low risk characteristics should include maternal and paternal age parameters such as 18 - 45 years of age. Complications in a previous pregnancy should include third degree lacerations. Complications of a previous pregnancy should include fractured clavicle and shoulder dystocia. (currently just shoulder dystocia) Complications of a previous pregnancy should i nclude history of large babies (>9 pounds). Complications of current pregnancy should include having an IUD in place when becoming pregnant. Complications of a current pregnancy should include parental Jehovah's Witness status - due to inability to transfu se. Complications of current pregnancy vaginal delivery after C section. Complications of a current pregnancy should include incomplete prenatal testing such as strep and all STDs. Complications of a current pregnancy should include severe mental health issues not well controlled or addressed. Transfer to a higher level of care considerations should include a transfer plan or protocol for DEMWs to include a transfer or back up plan for Obstetricians should be included. 15 4 7 8 10 13 6 11 3 15 16 38 HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 34 References Provided by Commenters Commenter References B1 1.

DEFINITIONS: 2.1 DISCUSSION WITH ANOTHER MIDWIFE, AN ARNP, OR A PHYSICIAN A discussion refers to a situation in which the midwife seeks advice or i nformation from a colleague about a clinical situation, presenting her management plan for feedback. 2.1.1 It is the midwife's responsibility to initiate a discussion with and provide accurate and complete clinical information to another midwife, a nurse practitioner, or a physician in order to plan care appropriately. This discussion can take place between midwives in the same practice. 2.1.2 Discussion should occur in a timely manner soon after the clinical situation is discovered. 2.1.3 Discussion may oc cur in person, by phone, fax, or e -mail. 2.1.4 Discussion may include review of relevant patient records. 2.1.5 Discussion may include request for prescriptive medication based on signs or symptoms and/or laboratory results. 2.1.6 Discussion should be docu mented by the midwife in her records. Documentation of discussion should refer only to practitioner type without specifying the name of the practitioner contacted. Documentation should also include the midwife's management plan. 2.1.7 Discussion need not o ccur if the midwife has previously encountered a particular situation, discussed it with a colleague, developed a management plan, and is currently managing the same clinical presentation. In this case, documentation of the management plan and discus sion w ith the client of the management plan is sufficient. 2.2 CONSULTATION WITH A PHYSICIAN A consultation refers to a situation in which the midwife, using her professional knowledge of the client and in accordance w ith this document, or by client request, se eks the opinion of a physician competent to give advice in the relevant field. The consultant will either conduct an in -person assessment of the client or will evaluate the client's records in order to address the problem that led to the consultation. 2.2.1 It is the midwife's responsibility to initiate a consultation and to communicate clearly to the consultant that she is seek ing a consultation. HERC Coverage Guidance - Out-of-hospital (OOH) Birth Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2015 Page 37 2.2.2 A consultation can involve the physician providing advice and information, and/or providing care to the w oman/newborn, and/or prescribing treatment for the woman or newborn. 2.2.3 In the case of an in -person consultation, the midwife should expect that the consultant will promptly communicate findings and recommendations to the client and the referring midwif e after the consultation has taken place. 2.2.4 Where urgency, distance, or climatic conditions do not allow an in -person consultation with a physician when it would otherwise be appropriate, the midwife should seek advice from the physician by phone or other similar means. The midwife should document this request for advice in her records and discuss the consultant's advice with the client. 2.2.5 It is the midwife's responsibility to provide all relevant medical records to the consultant, including a wri tten summary of the client's history and presenting problem, as appropriate. 2.2.6 Consultation must be fully documented by the midwife in her records, including the consultant's name, date of referral, and the consultant's findings, opinions, and recommen dations. The midwife must then discuss the consultant's recommendations with the client. 2.2.7 After consultation with a physician, care of the client and responsibility for decision making, with the informed consent of the client, either continues with th e midwife, is shared collaboratively by the midwife and the consultant, or transfers completely to the consultant. Transfer or sharing of care should occur only after dialogue and agreement among the client, the midwife, and the consultant. 2.3 TRANSFER T O A PHYSICIAN OR OTHER QUALIFIED HOSPITAL -BASED PROVIDER When care is transferred permanently or temporarily from the midwife to a qualified hospital based provider, the receiving practitioner assumes full responsibility for subsequent decision making, together with the client.

EVIDENCE OVERVIEW Clinical background Protons are positively -charged subatomic particles th at have been in clinical use as a form of external beam radiotherapy for over 60 years. Compared to the photon X -ray energy used in conventional radiotherapy, proton beams have physical attributes that are potentially appealing. Specifically, protons depos it radiation energy at or around the target, at the end of the range of beam penetration, a phenomenon known as the Bragg peak. The goal of any external beam radiotherapy is to deliver sufficient radiation to the target tumor while mitigating the effects o n adjacent normal tissue. This has been a challenge for conventional photon therapy due to the amount of radiation deposited both before and after the target is reached. While the amount of photon radiation at entry into the body is much higher than at exit, photon beams typically \"scatter\" to normal tissues after leaving the target. This so -called \"exit\" dose is absent for protons, as tissue beyond the point of peak energy deposition receives little to no radiation . Initial use of proton beam therapy (PBT) focused on conditions where sparing very sensitive adjacent normal tissues was felt to be of utmost importance, such as cancers or noncancerous malformations of the brain stem, eye, or spinal cord. In addition, proton beam therapy was advocated for many p ediatric tumors because even lower -dose irradiation of normal tissue in pediatric patients can result in pronounced acute and long -term toxicity. There are also long - standing concerns regarding radiation's potential to cause secondary malignancy later in l ife, particularly in those receiving radiation at younger ages. Finally, radiation may produce more nuanced effects in children, such as neurocognitive impairment in pediatric patients treated with radiotherapy for brain cancers. More recently, however, th e use of PBT has been expanded in many settings to treat more common cancers such as those of the prostate, breast, liver, and lung. With the growth in potential patient numbers and reimbursement, the construction of proton centers has grown substantially. There are now 14 operating proton centers in the U.S., including one in Seattle, WA that came online in March 2013. Eleven additional centers are under construction or in the planning stages, and many more are proposed. The construction of cyclotrons at t he heart of proton beam facilities is very expensive ($150 -$200 million for a multiple gantry facility). Indications This appraisal focuses on the use of proton beam therapy (PBT) to treat patients with multiple types of cancer as well as those with selec ted noncancerous conditions. Within each condition type, two general populations were specified as of interest for this evaluation : Patients receiving PBT as primary treatment for their condition (i.e., curative intent) Patients receiving PBT for recurren t disease or for failure of initial therapy (i.e., salvage) All forms of PBT were considered for this evaluation, including monotherapy, use of PBT as a \"boost\" mechanism to conventional radiation therapy, and combination therapy with other 3 Proton Beam Therapy Draft for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 11/12 /2015 modalities such as chemotherapy and surgery. All PBT studies that met entry criteria for this review were included, regardless of manufacturer, treatment protocol, location, or other such concerns. Conditions included in the evidence review are as follows: Cancers Bone tumors Brain, spinal, and paraspinal tumors Breast cancer Esophageal cancer Gastrointestinal cancers Gynecologic cancers Head and neck cancers (including skull base tumors) Liver cancer Lung cancer Lymphomas Ocular tumors Pediatric cancers (e.g., medulloblastoma, retinoblastoma, neuromas, pituitary adenomas) Evidence r eview A summary of the net health benefit of PBT vs. alternative treatments and the strength of available evidence on net health benefit, as well as an evaluation of consistency of these findings with clinical guideline statements and public/private coverage pol icy, can be found in Table 1. The level of comparative evidence was extremely limited for certain conditions and entirely absent for others. We identified a total of six RCTs and 37 nonrandomized comparative studies across all 19 condition types. Important ly, five of the six RCTs involved different treatment protocols for PBT and had no other comparison groups; while these are included for completeness, primary attention was paid to studies (RCTs and otherwise) that compared PBT to an alternative form of tr eatment. Most of the comparative studies identified also had major quality concerns. For example, nearly all non -randomized comparative studies were retrospective in nature, and many involved comparisons of a PBT cohort to a non -contemporaneous group rece iving alternative therapy. Major differences in patient demographics and baseline clinical characteristics as well as duration of follow -up were often noted between groups. Of the 6 RCTs identified, 1, 4, and 1 4 Proton Beam Therapy Draft for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 11/12 /2015 were judged to be of good, fair, and poor qua lity respectively. Corresponding figures for non - randomized comparative studies were 1, 20, and 16. As noted on Table 1, PBT was judged to have superior net health benefit for ocular tumors, and incremental net health benefit for adult brain/spinal tumors and pediatric cancers. PBT was comparable to alternative treatment options for patients with liver, lung, and prostate cancer as well as one noncancerous condition (hemangiomas). Importantly, however, the strength of evidence was low for all of these condi tions. The evidence base for all other condition types was insufficient to determine net health benefit, including two of the four most prevalent cancers in the U.S.: breast and gastrointestinal (lung and prostate are the other two). As with information on clinical effectiveness, data on potential harms of PBT come from RCTs, comparative cohort studies, and case series, although comparative harms data are still lacking for many condition types. Across all condition types, a total of 25 studies reported comp arative information on treatment -related harms; differences in the types of harms relevant to each condition, as well as variability in harms classification even within conditions, precludes any attempt to summarily present harms data across all 19 conditi on categories. Observational data on secondary malignancy with PBT are generally lacking. Two studies were identified with comparative information. One was a fair -quality matched retrospective cohort study comparing 1,116 patients in a linked Medicare -SEER database who received either PBT or photon radiation for a variety of cancers and were followed for a median of 6.4 years. On an unadjusted basis, the incidence rates of any secondary malignancy and malignancies occurring in the prior radiation field wer e numerically lower for PBT, but not statistically -significantly so. After adjustment for age, sex, primary tumor site, duration of follow -up, and year of diagnosis, PBT was associated with a risk of secondary malignancy approximately one -half that of phot on therapy (HR=0.52; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.85; p=0.009). There are challenges with these findings, however. First and foremost, the lower rate of secondary malignancy with PBT appeared to be manifested almost entirely in the first five years after radiotherapy, a time period in which a second cancer event is not typically attributed to prior radiation (Bekelman, 2013). In addition, patients were accrued over a very long time period (1973 -2001), only the very end of which included highly conformal photon technique s like IMRT. The second study was a poor -quality retrospective cohort study comparing PBT to photon radiotherapy in 86 infants who were treated for retinoblastoma and followed for a median of 7 years (PBT) or 13 years (photon radiotherapy). Therapy was rec eived at two different US centers (PBT at MGH and photon radiotherapy at Children's Hospital Boston). Kaplan -Meier analyses were conducted to control for differential follow -up but no adjustments were made for other differences between groups. Ten -year est imates of the cumulative incidence of secondary malignancy were numerically lower for PBT, but not statistically significantly so (5% vs. 14% for photon, p=0.12). However, when malignancies were restricted to those occurring in -field or thought to be radia tion-induced, a significant difference in favor of PBT was observed (0% vs. 14%, p=0.015). In addition, significant differences in favor of PBT in both cumulative incidence and radiotherapy -related malignancy were observed for the subgroup of patients with hereditary disease. Other harms are presented in detail for each condition type in the sections that follow. 5 Proton Beam Therapy Draft for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 11/12 /2015 No comparative studies were identified for curative therapy of: breast, esophageal, gastrointestinal, gynecologic, arteriovenous malformations. studies were for salvage treatment of: brain/spinal/paraspinal, breast, esophageal, gastrointestinal, Cancer Curative A single poor -quality retrospective comparative cohort study evaluated PBT for primary and recurrent sacral chordomas in 27 patients. Among these patients 21 were treated with surgery and combination PBT /photon therapy (mean radiatio n dose: 72.8 Gray Equivalents [GyE]), in comparison to six patients who received PBT/photons alone (mean dose: 70.6 GyE) . For patients with primary tumors, Kaplan -Meier estimates of local control, disease -free survival and overall survival exceeded 90% amo ng those treated by surgery and radiation (n=14). Only two of the six patients with primary tumors received radiation alone, one of whom had local failure at four years, distant metastases at five years, and died at 5.5 years. Salvage In the same study of 27 patients with sacral chordomas who were treated with PBT/photon radiation alone or in combination with surgery, seven radiation/surgery patients and four radiation -only patients had recurrent disease. Among patients in the radiation/surgery group, four patients died of disease 4 -10 years after treatment; the remainder was alive with disease at last follow -up. In the radiation -only group, two of four patients died of disease at 4 -5 years of follow -up; the other two were alive with disease at last follow -up. Harms In the study described above , multiple descriptive harms were reported. Patients receiving radiation alone reported numerically lower rates of abnormal bowel or bladder function as well as difficulty ambulating in comparison to those receiving co mbination therapy, but rates were not statistically tested. PBT patients also reported higher rates of return to work, although this was also not tested statistically. Evidence is thus inadequate to compare the potential harms of PBT relative to other radi ation modalities in patients with bone cancer. Brain, Spinal, and Paraspinal Tumors Curative Two poor-quality retrospective comparative cohort studies investigated primary PBT for brain, spinal, and paraspinal tumors. One was an evaluation of PBT (mean d ose: 54.6 GyE) vs. photon therapy (mean dose: 52.9 Gy) in 40 adults (mean age: 32 years; 65% male) who received surgical and radiation treatment of medulloblastoma at a single US cancer center . PBT patients were followed for a median of 2.2 years, while ph oton patients were followed for a 6 Proton Beam Therapy Draft for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 11/12 /2015 median of nearly five years. No statistical differences between radiation modalities were seen in Kaplan -Meier assessment of either overall or progression -free survival at two years. A numeric difference was seen in the ra te of local or regional failure (5% for PBT vs. 14% for photon), but this was not assessed statistically. The second study involved 32 patients treated for intramedullary gliomas with either PBT (n=10) or IMRT (n=22). While explicit comparisons were made between groups, the PBT population was primarily pediatric (mean age: 14 years), while the IMRT population was adult (mean age: 44 years). Patients in both groups were followed for a median of 24 months; dose was >50 GyE or Gy in approximately 75% of patie nts. While the crude mortality rate was lower in the PBT group (20% vs. 32% for IMRT, not tested), in multivariate analyses controlling for age, tumor pathology, and treatment modality, PBT was associated with significantly increased mortality risk (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 40.0, p=0.02). The rate of brain metastasis was numerically higher in the PBT group (10% vs. 5% for IMRT), but this was not statistically tested. Rates of local or regional recurrence did not differ between groups. Harms In the first study described above , PBT was associated with statistically -significantly lower rates of weight loss (median % of baseline: -1.2% vs. 5.8% for photon, p=0.004) as well as requirements for medical management of esophagitis (5% vs. 57% respectively, p<0.001). PBT patients also experienced less RTOG grade 2 or greater nausea and vomiting (26% vs. 71%, p=0.004). In the second study comparing primarily 10 pediatric patients (mean age: 14 years) receiving PBT for spinal cord gliomas to 22 adults receiving IMRT for the same condition (mean age: 44 years) (Kahn, 2011), no cases of long -term toxicity or myelopathy were reported in either group. Minor side -effect rates were reported for the overall cohort only. In summary, l imited, low -quality evidence suggests that PBT is associated with reductions in acute radiation -related toxicity relative to photon radiation in patients with brain and spinal tumors. 7 Proton Beam Therapy Draft for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 11/12 /2015 Table 1: Summary table assessing strength of evidence, direction of benefit, and consistency with relevant guideline statements and coverage policy .

One was a relatively large, fair -quality, retrospective comparative cohort study of 444 patients (median age: 61 years; 91% male) who were treat ed with chemotherapy and radiation (PBT, IMRT, or 3D -CRT) followed by surgical resection. Patients were followed for up to 60 days after hospital discharge. After adjustment for patient characteristics and clinical variables, 3D -CRT was associated with a s ignificantly greater risk of postoperative pulmonary complications vs. PBT (Odds Ratio [OR]: 9.13, 95% CI: 1.83, 45.42). No significant differences were observed between PBT and IMRT, however. No differences in the rate of gastrointestinal complications we re observed for any treatment comparison. In addition, a fair -quality comparative study was identified that examined early impact on lung inflammation and irritation in 75 patients receiving PBT, IMRT, or 3D -CRT for esophageal cancer; patients were follow ed for up to 75 days following radiation. Nearly all outcome and toxicity measures were reported for the entire cohort only. However, the rate of pneumonitis was found to be significantly higher among PBT patients (33% vs. 15% for IMRT/3D -CRT, p=0.04). In summary, e vidence is inadequate to compare the potential harms of PBT relative to other radiation modalities in patients with esophageal cancer, particularly in comparison to IMRT. Head and Neck Cancers Curative There were two poor -quality retrospective comparative cohorts of primary PBT in head and neck cancer. One was an evaluation of 33 patients treated with either PBT alone or PBT+photon therapy to a target dose of 76 Gy for a variety of head and neck malignancies in Ja pan. Treatment groups differed substantially in terms of age, gender, and duration of follow -up (mean: 5.9 vs. 3.1 years). Numeric differences in favor of PBT+photon therapy were seen for local control, recurrence, and mortality, but these were not statist ically tested, nor were multivariate adjustments made for differences between groups. The other study was a very small (n=6) comparison of endoscopic resection followed by either PBT or IMRT as well as endoscopy alone in patients with maligna nt clival tum ors. Limited description of the study suggests that PBT was used only in cases of residual disease, while it is unclear whether IMRT was also used in this manner or as an adjuvant modality. One of the IMRT patients died of causes unrelated to disease; no o ther deaths were reported. Salvage In the first study described above , four patients were identified as having recurrent disease, three of whom received PBT alone. Two of the three PBT -only patients were alive with local tumor control at last follow -up (5 and 17 years respectively); one patient had their cancer recur three months after PBT and died in month 7 of follow -up. The one PBT+photon patient died at 2.5 years of follow -up, but was described as having local tumor control. 9 Proton Beam Therapy Draft for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 11/12 /2015 Harms In the first study describe above, rates of tongue ulceration, osteonecrosis, and esophageal stenosis differed somewhat between treatment groups, but were not statistically tested. Overall toxicity rates were estimated to be 22.8% at both three and five years, but were not s tratified by treatment modality. In a separate, fair -quality study comparing rates of vision loss from radiation -induced optic neuropathy in 75 patients treated with PBT or carbon -ion therapy for head and neck or skull base tumors, unadjusted rates of vis ion loss were similar between modalities (8% and 6% for PBT and carbon -ion respectively, not statistically tested). In multivariate analyses controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment modality had no effect on rates of vision loss (p=0.42). Another comparison of PBT and carbon -ion therapy in 59 patients with head and neck or skull base tumors was of poor quality (due to no control for differences between patient groups) and focused on the incidence of radiation -induced brain changes . The incidence of CTCAE brain injury of any grade was significantly (p=0.002) lower in the PBT group. MRI -based assessment of brain changes showed a lower rate in the PBT group (17% vs. 64% for carbon - ion), although this was not tested statistically. In summary, e vidence is inadequate to compare the potential harms of PBT relative to other radiation modalities in patients with head and neck cancer. Liver Cancer Curative Two fair-quality prospective comparative cohort studies provided evidence of the clin ical effectiveness of primary use of PBT in liver cancer. One was an evaluation of 35 patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who were treated with PBT (mean dose: 76.5 GyE) either alone or in combination with chemotherapy and were follow ed for up to 4 years. While statistical testing was not performed, rates of local tumor control and the proportion of patients experiencing reductions in tumor volume were nearly identical between groups. The other study was also prospective but compared PBT to another heavy -ion modality not in circulation in the U.S. (carbon ion). In this study, a fair -quality comparison of 350 patients with HCC who received PBT (53-84 GyE) or carbon -ion (53-76 GyE) therapy and were followed for a median of 2.5 years , no statistically -significant differences were observed in 5 -year Kaplan - Meier estimates of local control, no biological evidence of disease, or overall survival between treated groups. Salvage Two studies were identified with information on recurrent disease. One was a poor -quality comparison of PBT to conventional photon radiation in eight patients with recurrent HCC after hepatectomy. Five patients were treated with PBT (68.8 -84.5 GyE), and three with photons (60 - 70 Gy). Seven of eight patients died of liver failure or lung metastasis a median of 1.5 years after radiation; the one patient alive at the end of follow -up was a photon patient. The rate of local tumor control was 78%, and did not differ between treatment groups. 10 Proton Beam Therapy Draft for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 11/12 /2015 The other study was a previously -described prospective comparison of PBT to carbon -ion therapy in 350 patients with primary or recurrent HCC. No subgroup analyses were performed, but prior treatment history for HCC was found not to have a statistically -significant impact on local tumor co ntrol (p=0.73). Prior treatment was not examined as a risk factor for overall survival, however. Harms Two comparative studies were identified with comparative information on radiation -related harms. In a previously -described study of eight patients with recurrent HCC after hepatectomy, there were no instances of bone marrow depression or gastrointestinal complications in either group. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels increased in the three photon patients and 4/5 PBT patients, although this w as not tested statistically. In the other study, a previously -described comparison of PBT to carbon -ion therapy in 350 patients with primary or recurrent HCC, rates of toxicities as graded by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) framework were comparable between groups, including dermatitis, GI ulcer, pneumonitis, and rib fracture. The rate of grade 3 or higher toxicities was similar between groups (3% vs. 4% for PBT and carbon -ion respectively), although this was not statistically tested. In summary, l imited, lo w-quality evidence suggests that PBT is associated with comparable rates of toxicity to other radiation modalities in patients with liver cancer. Lung Cancer Curative Three fair -quality comp arative cohort studies examined the clinical effectiveness of PBT in lung cancer. Two studies retrospectively compared outcomes with PBT to those with IMRT or older three -dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D -CRT) at a US cancer center . One study involved 250 patients with non -small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were treated with 66 Gy of photons or 74 GyE of protons and followed for up to one year to assess a key measure of lung function known as diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). While this measure did not differ be tween PBT and IMRT at 5 -8 months after treatment, DLCO declined significantly more in the 3D -CRT group as compared to PBT after adjustment for pretreatment characteristics and other lung function measures (p=0.009). A second study focused on survival in 2 02 patients with locally -advanced, unresectable NSCLC who were followed for a median of 1.5 years and treated 74 GyE of PBT or 63 Gy of either IMRT or 3D -CRT. Actuarial estimates of median overall survival were 24.4, 17.6, and 17.7 months for PBT, IMRT, an d 3D -CRT respectively, although these differences were not statistically significant (p=0.1061). A third study was a prospectively -measured cohort but, as with the study of liver cancer mentioned above, compared PBT to carbon ion therapy, evaluating 111 Japanese NSCLC patients over a median of 3.5 years. No statistically -significant differences between groups were observed in three -year actuarial estimates of local control, progression -free survival, or overall survival. 11 Proton Beam Therapy Draft for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 11/12 /2015 Salvage In the second study descri bed above , 22% of the study sample was identified as having a prior malignancy of any type. The effects of prior malignancy on overall survival were not reported, howeve r. Harms A total of three comparative studies assessed harms in patients with lung canc er. One was a study of severe radiation -induced esophagitis (within six months of treatment) among 652 patients treated for NSCLC with PBT, IMRT, or 3D -CRT at a US cancer center. Rates of grade 3 or higher esophagitis were 6%, 8%, and 28% for -CRT vs. IMRT). In the previously -described noncontemporaneous case series comparison of patients with locally -advanced, unresectable NSCLC who were treated with PBT, IMRT, or 3D -CRT, hematologic toxicity rates d id not differ by radiation modality. Significant differences in favor of PBT were seen in rates of grade 3 or higher esophagitis (5%, 39%, and 18% for PBT, (2%, 6%, and 30%, p<0.001), while rates of grade 3 or higher dermatitis were significantly greater in the PBT group (24% vs. 17% and 7% for IMRT and 3D -CRT, p<0.001). Finally, in a previously -described comparison of PBT to carbon -ion therapy in 111 patients in Japan, rates of pneumonitis, der matitis, and rib fracture did not differ statistically between radiation modalities across all toxicity grades. In summary, m oderate evidence suggests that rates of treatment -related toxicities with PBT are comparable to those seen with other radiation modalities in patients with lung cancer. Ocular Tumors Curative In comparison to other cancer types, the evidence base for ocular tumors was relatively substantial. A total of seven comparative studies were identified of the clinical benefits of primary PBT in such cancers \u2014a single RCT, four retrospective cohort studie s, a comparison of a recent case series to the treatment groups from the RCT, and a comparison of noncontemporaneous case series. The RCT compared PBT alone to a combination of PBT and transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) in 151 patients treated for uveal me lanoma and followed for a median of 3 years. Combination therapy was associated with a statistically -significantly (p=0.02) reduced likelihood of secondary enucleation; no other outcomes differed significantly between groups. In a separate, poor -quality co mparison of these findings to a separate series of patients undergoing PBT with endoresection of the scar, rates of secondary enucleation did not differ between groups, but rates of neovascular glaucoma were significantly lower in the PBT+endoresection gro up vs. the groups from the RCT (7% vs. 58% and 49% for PBT alone and PBT+TTT respectively, p<0.0001). Of note, however, median follow -up was less than two years in the PBT+endoresection series vs. 9 years in the RCT. 12 Proton Beam Therapy Draft for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 11/12 /2015 Three of the cohort studies were all fair-quality and involved comparisons to surgical enucleation in patients with uveal melanoma at single centers . PBT was associated with statistically -significant improvements in overall survival rates relative to enucleation at 2 -5 years in two of these studies . Rates of metastasis -related and all cancer -related death were statistically -significantly lower among PBT patients through two years of follow -up in one study (n=1,051), but were nonsignificant at later timepoints . The 5 -year metastasis -free survi val rate in a second study (n=67) was 50% higher among PBT patients in a Cox regression model controlling for baseline characteristics (59.0% vs. 39.4% for enucleation, p=0.02). In the third study, Kaplan -Meier curves for all -cause mortality, melanoma -related mortality and metastasis - free survival did not statistically differ for 132 patients treated with P BT and enucleation . Metastasis -free survival also did not differ in Cox regression adjusting for age, sex, and tumor thickness. Another fair -quality stu dy assessed the impact of PBT + chemotherapy vs. PBT alone in 88 patients with uveal melanoma who were followed for 5 -8 years. Five -year overall survival rates did not statistically differ between groups on either an unadjusted or Cox regression -adjusted basis. Finally, a poor -quality comparison of noncontemporaneous case series evaluated treatment with PBT + laser photocoagulation or PBT alone in 56 patients with choroidal melanoma. At one year, there were no differences in visual acuity between groups. Salvage A single comparative study examined PBT in recurrent ocular cancer. In this fair -quality, comparative cohort study, a total of 73 patients with uveal melanoma had recurrence of disease following an initial course of PBT at a US hospital. Patients ( mean age: 58 years) were treated with either a second course of PBT (70 GyE) in five fractions or surgical enucleation and followed for 5 -7 years. The likelihood of overall survival at five years was significantly (p=0.04) longer in the PBT group (63% vs. 36% for enucleation), as was the probability of being free of metastasis at this timepoint (66% vs. 31% respectively, p=0.028). Findings were similar after Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for tumor volume and year of retreatment as well as pa tient age. The likelihood of local tumor recurrence at five years was 31% in the PBT group. No local recurrences were found in the enucleation group, which is not surprising given the nature of the treatment. Harms Two comparative studies a ssessed the harm s of PBT for ocular cancers. In the previously - described RCT comparing PBT with thermotherapy to PBT alone in 151 patient s with uveal melanoma , no statistically -significant differences were observed between groups in rates of cataracts, ma culopathy, pap illopathy, glaucoma, or intraocular pressure. The combination therapy group had a significantly lower rate of secondary enucleation (p=0.02), although actual figures were not reported. In a previously -described comparison of PBT to enucleation in 132 patients treated for unilateral choroidal tumors, rates of eye loss in the PBT arm were assessed and estimated to be 26% at five years of follow -up. In summary, l imited, low -quality evidence suggests comparable rates of harm for PBT relative to treatment alternati ves in patients with ocular tumors. 13 Proton Beam Therapy Draft for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 11/12 /2015 Pediatric Cancers Harms PBT's theoretical potential to lower radiation -induced toxicity in children serves as the comparative evidence base. Comparative studies are lacking, most likely due to a lack of clinical equipois e. Other than the study of secondary malignancy described above, no comparative studies of the potential harms of PBT in patients with ped iatric cancers were identified. Prostate Cancer Curative The largest evidence base available was for prostate cancer (10 studies). However, only 6 of these studies reported clinical outcomes and compared PBT to alternative treatments. These included an RCT, a prospective comparative cohort, and four comparisons of noncontemporaneous case series. The included RCT was a fair -quality comparison of 202 patients with advanced (stages T3 -T4) prostate cancer who were randomized to receive either photon therapy with a proton boost (total dose: 75.2 GyE) or photons alone (67.2 Gy) and were followed for a median of five years . Kaplan -Meier estimates of local tumor control, disease -specific survival, and overall survival were similar at both 5 - and 8 -year timepoints among the entire intent -to-treat population as well as those completing the trial (n=189). However, in patients wi th poorly -differentiated tumors (Gleason grades 4 or 5), local control at 8 years was significantly better in patients receiving PBT+photons (85% vs. 40% for photons alone, p=0.0014). The prospective cohort study was a fair -quality comparison of patient -reported health -related QoL at multiple timepoints among 185 men (mean age: 69 years) with localized prostate cancer who were treated with PBT, PBT+photons, photons alon e, surgery, or watchful waiting. Overall QoL, general health status, and treatment -related symptom scales were employed. No differences in overall QoL or general health status were observed at 18 months of follow -up, although men treated with PBT monotherapy reported better physical function in comparison to surgery (p=0.01) or photon radiati on (p=0.02), and better emotional functioning in relation to photon radiation (p<0.001). Men receiving PBT+photons also reported significantly fewer urinary symptoms at 18 months in comparison to watchful waiting (p<0.01). Outcomes were also assessed in th ree comparisons of noncontemporaneous case series. One was a fair -quality evaluation of high-dose PBT+photons (79.2 GyE) in 141 patients enrolled in a clinical trial who were matched on clinical and demographic criteria to 141 patients treated with brachyt herapy. Patients were followed for a median of eight years. Eight -year actuarial estimates of overall survival, freedom from metastasis, and biochemical failure did not statistically differ between groups. The proportion of patients achieving a nadir PSA l evel of 0.5 ng/mL as of their final measurement was significantly higher in the brachytherapy group (92% vs. 74% for PBT, p=0.0003). 14 Therapy Draft for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 11/12 /2015 Two additional studies were deemed to be of poor quality due to a lack of control for confounding between study populati ons. One was a comparison of a cohort of 206 brachytherapy patients compared with the same PBT+photon group described above. The difference in the percentage of patients achieving nadir PSA after a median of 5.4 years of follow -up was similar to that repor ted in the study above (91% vs. 59%), although statistical results were not reported. Five -year estimates of disease -free survival (using biochemical failure definitions) did not statistically differ between groups. The other study involved comparisons of bowel - and urinary -related QoL in three Gy) . Statistical changes were assessed within (but not between) each cohort immediately following treatment as well as at 12 and 24 months of follow -up, and were also assessed for whether the change was considered \"clinically meaningful\" (>0.5 SD of baseline values). Some differences in QoL decrements were seen at earlier timepoints. However, at 24 months, all groups expe rienced statistically and clinically significant decrements in bowel QoL, and none of the groups had significant declines in urinary QoL. A fourth, poor -quality comparison of case series involved an evaluation of patient -reported outcomes on the Expanded P rostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire among a cohort of 1,243 patients receiving PBT for prostate cancer and a group of 204 patients receiving IMRT from a previous multicenter study. Statistically -significant differences between treatment groups were observed for many baseline characteristics, only some of which were adjusted for in multivariate analyses. No differences were observed in summary scores for bowel, urinary, and sexual QoL at two years, although more IMRT patients reported specifi c bowel frequency (10% vs. PBT, p=0.05) and urgency (15% vs. 7%, p=0.02) problems at two years. Harms Four comparative studies examined the harms associated with PBT and alternative treatments in patients with prostate cancer. The previously -describ ed RCT of PBT+photon therapy vs. photons alone examined rates of rectal bleeding, urethral stricture, hematuria, incontinence, and loss of full potency; no patients in either arm had grade 3 or higher toxicity during radiation therapy. Actuarial estimates of rectal bleeding at eight years were significantly higher in the PBT+photon arm (32% vs. 12% for photons alone, p=0.002), although this was primarily grade 2 or lower toxicity. Rates of urethral stricture, hematuria, incontinence, and loss of potency did not differ between groups. Three additional studies involved retrospective comparisons using available databases. The most recent was a matched comparison of 314 PBT and 628 IMRT patients treated for early - stage prostate cancer using the linked Chronic Co ndition Warehouse -Medicare database with a focus on complications occurring within 1 2 months of treatment . At six months, rates of genitourinary toxicity were significantly lower in the PBT arm (5.9% vs. 9.5%, p=0.03). This difference was not apparent afte r 12 months of follow -up, however (18.8% vs. 17.5%, p=0.66). Rates of gastrointestinal and other (e.g., infection, nerve damage) complications did not statistically differ at either timepoint. 15 Proton Beam Therapy Draft for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 11/12 /2015 Another recent study compared matched cohorts of men with pro state cancer in the linked Medicare -SEER database who were treated with PBT or IMRT (684 patients in each arm) and followed for a median of four years . IMRT patients had a statistically -significantly lower rate of gastrointestinal morbidity (12.2 vs. 17.8 per 100 person -years, p<0.05). No other statistical differences were noted in genitourinary morbidity, erectile dysfunction, hip fracture, or use of additional cancer therapy. Finally, there was an analysis of nearly 30,000 men in the Medicare -SEER databas e who were treated with PBT, IMRT, 3D -CRT, brachytherapy, or conservative management (observation alone) and evaluated for gastr ointestinal toxicity . All forms of radiation had higher rates of GI morbidity than conservative management. In pairwise comparis ons using Cox proportional hazards regression, PBT was associated with higher rates of GI morbidity than conservative management (HR: 5.2). In summary, m oderate e vidence suggests that rates of major harms are comparable between PBT and photon radiation treatments, particularly IMRT. Noncancerous Conditions Ocular Hemangiomas Curative A single poor -quality retrospective study evaluated PBT's clinical effectiveness i n 44 patients with diffuse or circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas who were treated with GyE) or photon therapy (16-20 Gy) and followed for an average of 2.5 years . Unadjusted outcomes were reported for the entire cohort only; reduction in tumor thickness, resolution of retinal detachment, and stabilization of visual acuity were observed in >90% of the overall sample. In Kaplan -Meier analysis of outcomes adjusting for differential follow -up between treatment groups, therapeutic modality had no statistically -significant effects on stabilization of visual acuity (p=0.43). Harms A single, previously -described retrospective comparative cohort study assessed outcomes in patients with circumscribed or diffuse hemangiomas treated with PBT or photon radiation. Small differences in unadjusted rates of optic nerve/disc atrophy, lacrimation (formation of tears) and ocular pressure as well as effects on the retina, lens, and iris were observed between groups, but most side effects were grade 1 or 2. The rate of retinopathy was substantially higher in PBT patients (40% vs. 16% for photons). However, in Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for between -group differences, no effect of radiation modality on outcomes was observed, including retinopathy (p=0.12). Other Benign Tumors Curative Two comparative studies of PBT's clinical effectiveness in other benign tumors were both of poor quality. One was a retrospective cohort of consisting of 20 patients with giant -cell bone tumors who were treated with PBT+photon therapy (mean: 59 GyE) or photons alone (mean: 52 16 Proton Beam Therapy Draft for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 11/12 /2015 Gy) and followed for median of 9 years . Patients could also have received partial tumor resection. Of note, the PBT population consisted entirely of young adults (mean age: 23 years), while the p hoton -only population was much older (mean: 46 years); no attempt was made to control for differences between treatment groups. Rates of disease progression, progression - free survival, and distant metastases were numerically similar between groups, althoug h these rates were not statistically tested. The other study was a small cohort study comparing PBT alone, photon therapy alone, or PBT + photons in 25 patients with optic nerve sheath meningioma. On an overall basis, visual acuity improved in most patient s. Rates did not numerically differ between treatment groups, although these were not tested statistically. Salvage In the first study described above , five of 20 were identified as having recurrent disease. Two of the five were treated with PBT+photon therapy, one of whom had progression of disease at eight months but no further progression after retreatment at five years of follow -up. The other patien t was free of local progression and metastases as of 9 years of follow -up. In the three photon patients, one had local progression at 12 months but no further progression as of year 19 of follow -up, one patient was free of progression and metastases as of five years of follow - up, and one patient had unknown status. Harms The previously -described study comparing PBT, PBT+photon, and photon therapy alone in 25 patients treated for optic nerve sheath meningiomas showed numerically lower rates of acute orbital pain and headache for both PBT groups compared to photon therapy, and numerically higher rates of late asymptomatic retinopathy. None of these comparisons were tested statistically, however. Evidence is limited and inadequate to compare the potential harm s of PBT relative to other radiation modalities in patients with other benign tumors. Cost & Cost -Effectiveness Limited data are available about costs of PBT in most types of cancer. One study of breast cancer patients in the US examined reimbursement for treatment with 3D -conformal partial breast irradiation using protons or photons vs. traditional whole breast irradiation. Payments included those of treatment planning and delivery as well as patient time and transport. Total per-patient costs were substa ntially higher for PBT vs. photon partial irradiation ($13,200 vs. $5,300) but only modestly increased relative to traditional whole breast irradiation ($10,600), as the latter incurred higher professional service fees and involved a greater amount of pati ent time. Two additional studies from the same group assessed the cost -effectiveness of PBT vs. photon radiation among women with left -sided breast cancer in Sweden . In the first of these, photon radiation was assumed to increase the risk of ischemic and o ther cardiovascular disease as well as pneumonitis relative to PBT; clinical effectiveness was assumed to be identical. Reductions in adverse events led to a gain in quality -adjusted life years (QALYs) equivalent to approximately one month (12.35 vs. 12.25 for photon). Costs of PBT were nearly triple those of photon therapy, however ($11,124 vs. $4,950), leading to an incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $65,875 per QALY gained. The other study used essentially the same model but 17 Proton Beam Therapy Draft for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 11/12 /2015 focused attention only on women at high risk of cardiac disease (43% higher than general population). In this instance, a much lower ICER was observed ($33,913 per QALY gained). One study evaluated the economic impact of PBT in lung cancers among patients in the Netherlan ds. A Markov model compared PBT to carbon -ion therapy, stereotactic radiation therapy, and conventional radiation in patients with stage 1 non -small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) over a 5 -year time horizon. Effects of therapy included both overall and disease -related mortality as well as adverse events such as pneumonitis and esophagitis. For inoperable NSCLC, PBT was found to be both more expensive and less effective than either carbon -ion or stereotactic radiation and was therefore not included in subsequent a nalyses focusing on inoperable disease. While not reported in the paper, PBT's derived cost -effectiveness relative to conventional radiation (based on approximately $5,000 in additional costs and 0.35 additional QALYs) was approximately $18,800 per QALY ga ined. Three decision analyses were available that focused on pediatric cancers, all of which focused on a lifetime time horizon in children with medulloblastoma who were treated at 5 years of age. In a US -based model that incorporated costs and patient pr eference (utility) values of treatment and management of adverse events such as growth hormone deficiency, cardiovascular disease, hypothyroidism, and secondary malignancy, PBT was found to generate lower lifetime costs ($80,000 vs. $112,000 per patient fo r conventional radiation) and a greater number of QALYs (17.37 vs. 13.91). Reduced risks for PBT were estimated based on data from dosimetric and modeling studies. Sensitivity analyses on the risk of certain adverse events changed the magnitude of PBT's co st-effectiveness, but it remained less costly and more effective in all scenarios. Pediatric medulloblastoma was assessed in two modeling studies. As with the analysis above, PBT was assumed to reduce both mortality and nonfatal adverse events relative to conventional photon therapy. On a per -patient basis, PBT was assumed to reduce lifetime costs by approximately $24,000 per patient and increase quality -adjusted life expectancy by nearly nine months (12.8 vs. 12.1 QALYs). On a population basis, 25 medullob lastoma patients treated by PBT would have lifetime costs reduced by $600,000 and generate an additional 17.1 QALYs relative to conventional photon radiation. Finally, four studies were identified that examined costs and cost -effectiveness of PBT for prost ate cancer. An analysis of the 2008 -2009 Chronic Condition Warehouse examined treatment costs for matched Medicare beneficiaries with prostate cancer who received PBT or IMRT. Median Medicare reimbursements were $32,428 and $18,575 for PBT and IMRT respect ively (not statistically tested). A relatively recent Markov decision analysis estimated the lifetime costs and effectiveness of PBT, IMRT, and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for localized prostate cancer. Clinical effectiveness and impact on m ortality were assumed to be equivalent across all three groups. SBRT was found to have the lowest treatment costs and shortest time in treatment of the three modalities, and produced slightly more QALYs (8.11 vs. 8.05 and 8.06 for IMRT and PBT respectively ) based on an expected rate of sexual dysfunction approximately half that of IMRT or PBT. SBRT was cost -saving or cost -effective vs. PBT in 94% of probabilistic simulations. 18 Proton Beam Therapy Draft for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 11/12 /2015 An earlier decision analysis estimated the potential cost -effectiveness of a hypot hetically - escalated PBT dose (91.8 GyE) vs. 81 Gy delivered with IMRT over a 15 -year time horizon. The model focused on mortality and disease progression alone (i.e., toxicities were assumed to be similar between groups), and assumed a 10% reduction in dis ease progression from PBT's higher dose. This translated into QALY increases of 0.42 and 0.46 years in 70 - and 60 -year-old men with intermediate -risk disease respectively. Costs of PBT were $25,000 -$27,000 higher in these men. ICERs for vs. IMRT were $ 63,578 and $55,726 per QALY for 70 - and 60 -year- old men respectively. Finally, the model also evaluated costs and outcomes for a hypothetical cohort of 300 65 year - old men with prostate cancer. PBT was assumed to result in a 20% reduction in cancer recurre nce relative to conventional radiation as well as lower rates of urinary and gastrointestinal toxicities. PBT was estimated to be approximately $8,000 more expensive than conventional radiation over a lifetime but result in a QALY gain of nearly 4 months ( 0.297). The resulting cost -effectiveness ratio was $26,481 per QALY gained. EVIDENCE S UMMARY Proton beam therapy (PBT) has been used for clinical purposes for over 50 years and has been delivered to tens of thousands of patients with a variety of cancers and noncancerous conditions. Despite this, evidence of PBT's comparative clinical effectiveness and comparative value is lacking for nearly all conditions under study in this review. As mentioned previously, it is unlikely that significant comparative stud y will be forthcoming for childhood cancers despite uncertainty over long -term outcomes, as the potential benefits of PBT over alternative forms of radiation appear to be generally accepted in the clinical and payer communities. In addition, patient recrui tment for potential studies may be untenable in very rare conditions (e.g., thymoma, arteriovenous malformations). In other areas, however, including common cancers such as breast and prostate, the poor evidence base and residual uncertainty around the eff ects of PBT is highly problematic. The net health benefit of PBT relative to alternative treatments is rated \"Superior\" (moderate - large net health benefit) in ocular tumors and \"Incremental\" (small net health benefit) in adult brain/spinal and pedia tric cancers. The net health benefit is judged \"Comparable\" (equivalent net health benefit) in several other cancers, including liver, lung, and prostate cancer, as well as ocular hemangiomas. It should be noted, however, that judgments of comparability were made based on a limited evidence base that provides relatively low certainty that PBT is roughly equivalent to alternative therapies. While further study may reduce uncertainty and clarify differences between treatments, it is currently the case that PB T is far more expensive than its major alternatives, and evidence of its short or long -term relative cost -effectiveness is lacking for many of these conditions. It should also be noted that evidence was examined for 11 cancers and noncancerous conditions n ot listed above, and it was determined that there was insufficient evidence to obtain even a basic understanding of PBT's comparative clinical effectiveness and comparative value. 19 Proton Beam Therapy Draft for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 11/12 /2015 GRADE -INFORMED FRAMEWORK The HERC develops recommendations by using the concepts of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. GRADE is a transparent and structured process for developing and presenting evidence and for carrying out the s teps involved in developing recommendations. There are four elements that determine the strength of a recommendation, as listed in the table below. The HERC reviews the evidence and makes an assessment of each element, which in turn is used to develop the recommendations presented in the coverage guidance box. Balance between desirable and undesirable effects, and quality of evidence, are derived from the evidence presented in this document, while estimated relative costs, v alues and preferences are assessm ents of the HERC members . Indication / Intervention Balance between desirable and undesirable effects Quality of evidence * Resource allocation Variability in v alues and preferences Coverage recommen dati on Rationale PBT for ocular tumors (excluding hemangiomas) Superior benefit, fewer harms Moderate Moderate ; expensive, but lowered projected costs due to greater benefit and fewer harms Low variability (preference for PBT) Recommended for coverage (strong recommendation) Moderate quality evidence demonstrates PBT is superior to other therapies with fewer harms, although at a greater cost, and many patients would choose this. PBT for adult malignant brain/spinal tumors Comparable benefit but fewer harms. Very Low** Moderate ; expensive, but lowered projected costs due to fewer harms Low variability (preference for PBT) Recommended for coverage (weak recommendation ) There is very low quality evidence of incremental benefit compared to alternatives, but also with higher costs. People would like ly choo se what is thought to have fewer harms and greater benefit. 20 Proton Beam Therapy Draft for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 11/12 /2015 Indication / Intervention Balance between desirable and undesirable effects Quality of evidence * Resource allocation Variability in v alues and preferences Coverage recommen dati on Rationale PBT for skull base , paranasal sinus, and juxtaspinal tumors Comparable benefit but fewer harms. Very Low** Moderate, expensive, but lowered projected costs due to fewer harms Low (preference for PBT) Recommended for coverage (weak recommendation) The subcommittee heard e xpert testimony that skull -base tumors were one of the first uses of proton beam therapy in the 1960s and that reduction in harms to surrounding structures whi le delivering adequate dosimetry to tumor tissue is the primary consideration in treatment planning. Based on comparable benefit and fewer harms, allowing for higher costs but patient preference, weak recommendation for coverage. 21 Proton Beam Therapy Draft for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 11/12 /2015 Indication / Intervention Balance between desirable and undesirable effects Quality of evidence * Resource allocation Variability in v alues and preferences Coverage recommen dati on Rationale PBT for malignant pediatr ic tumors Comparable benefit but fewer harms. Very Low** Moderate , expensive, but lowered projected costs due to fewer harms Moderate (significant concerns regarding radiation therapy , given variety of tumors may have options for alternative therapies ) Recommended for coverage (weak recommendation) Very low quality evidence suggests comparable benefit, and fewer harms, with a potential health impact over decades. There is a strong theoretical benefit for reducing secondary tumors although there is not good evidence to support this . Cost- effectiveness analyses suggest long term cost savings with PBT for pediatric tumors. There is a lack of clinical equipoise and therefore future studies on this are unlikely. PBT for liver cancer Comparable benefit, comparable harms Low High Moderate Do not recommend (weak recommendation ) There is s ufficient evidence that PBT has comparable benefits and harms to alternatives, but is more expensive , PBT for lung cancer Comparable benefit, comparable harms Low High Moderate Do not recommend (weak recommendation ) Sufficient evidence of similar effectiveness, similar risk, and more cost. 22 Proton Beam Therapy Draft for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 11/12 /2015 Indication / Intervention Balance between desirable and undesirable effects Quality of evidence * Resource allocation Variability in v alues and preferences Coverage recommen dati on Rationale PBT for prostate cancer Comparable benefit, comparable harms Low High Moderate Do not recommend (weak recommendation ) There is s ufficient evidence of similar effectiveness, similar risk, and more cost. There may be improved local control in poorly differentiated prostate cancer (Glisan 4 -5) but no demonstrated impact on survival . PBT for ocular hemangiomas Comparable benefit, comparable harms Very Low High Moderate to high, due to uncertainty of benefit Do not recommend (weak recommendation) Insufficient evidence exists, but it is suggesting comparable benefit. Given that there are alternatives available wi th similar risk and less exp ensive, recommendation against coverage. 23 Proton Beam Therapy Draft for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 11/12 /2015 Indication / Intervention Balance between desirable and undesirable effects Quality of evidence * Resource allocation Variability in v alues and preferences Coverage recommen dati on Rationale PBT for Bone: Low All others: No evidence High Moderate (many would not choose PBT due to cost, need to travel, uncertain benefit) Do not recommend (weak recommendation) Insufficient evidence, unknown risk compared to alternative , and increased cost. *The Quality of Evidence rating was assigned by the primary evidence source, not the HERC Subcommittee , except as specified. ** The Quality of Evidence rating was assigned by the HERC Subcommittee . Note: GRADE framework elements are described in Appendix A 24 Proton Beam Therapy Draft for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 11/12 /2015 POLICY LANDSCAPE Quality measures No quality measures were identified when searching the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse . Professional society guidelines Guidelines on the use of proton beam therapy are available from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN , 2013 -2014 ), American Society for 2011 -2013 ), American Cancer Society (ACS), and the Alberta Health Services in Canada (2013) . Bone Cancer NCCN guidelines state that for unresectable high - and low -grade chondrosarcomas of the skull base and axial skeleton, PBT may be indicated to allow for high -dose treatment. Alberta guidelines recommend PBT for sarcomas, including chordoma and chondrosarcoma. According to the ACR, PBT-based treatment plans are considered inappropriate (rated 1 -2) in spinal and non-spinal bone metastases . Brain, Spinal, and Paraspinal Tumors Alberta guidelines r ecommend PBT as an option for CNS lesions including craniopharyngioma, germ ce ll tumors and low -grade gliomas. Head and Neck Cancers For ethmoid and maxillary sinus tumors, NCCN considers PBT an investigative therapeutic technique only. Alberta guidelines state that t reatment with PBT for adults with acoustic neuromas, and paranasal sinus and nasal cavity tumors is recommended . Lung Cancer NCCN considers PBT appropriate for non -small -cell lung cancer. ACR recommends against use of PBT f or NSCLC patients wit h poor performance status or requir ements for palliative treatment, while Alberta guidelines do not recommend PBT for NSCLC. Lymphomas NCCN states that PBT may be appropriate for patients with Hodgkin and Non -Hodgkin lymphoma as well as soft tissue sarcom as; however, long -term studies are necessary to confirm benefits and harms. Alberta guidelines do recommend PBT for lymphomas only in patients less than 30 years of age. Ocular Tumors NCCN guidelines for treatment options in ocular tumors are under develo pment. Alberta guidelines recommend PBT for ocular melanoma. 25 Beam Therapy Draft for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 11/12 /2015 Pediatric Tumors Guidelines from Alberta recommend consideration of PBT for pediatric tumors including ependymomas, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, pineal irradiation. Prostate C ancer NCCN and Alberta guidelines do not recommend PBT for use in prostate cancer, as superior or equivalent effects have not been demonstrated in comparison to conventional external -beam therapy. In a position statement, ASTRO conclude d that the evidence supporting the use of PBT in prostate cancer continues to develop and define its role among current alternate treatment modalities. ASTRO strongly supports the provision of coverage with evidence development to evaluate th e comparative effectiveness of PBT relative to other options including IMRT and brachytherapy. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae consider PBT for treatment planning in T1 and T2 prostate cancer to be appropriate but with lower ratings than for IMRT (6 -7 versus 8 -9, based on a 1 -9 scale). Non -cancerous conditions Alberta Health Services guidelines recommend PBT for benign conditions such as AVMs and meningiomas.

GRADE ELEMENT DESCRIPTIONS Strong recommendation In Favor: The subcommittee is confident that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences. Against: The subcommittee is confide nt that the undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the desirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences. Weak recommendation In Favor: The subcommittee concludes that th e desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences, but is not confident. Against: The subcommittee concludes that t he undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the desirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences, but is not confident. Quality or strength of evidence rating ac ross studies for the treatment/outcome1 High: The subcommittee is very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with few or no limitations and the estimate of effect is likely stable. Moderate: The subcommittee is moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with some limit ations or well -performed nonrandomized studies with additional strengths that guard against potential bias and have large estimates of effects. Low: The subcommittee's confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially diffe rent from the estimate of the effect. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with serious limitations or nonrandomized studies without special strengths. 1 Includes risk of bias, precision, directness, consistency and publication bias Element Description Balance between desirable and undesirable effects The larger the difference between the desirable and undesirable effects, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted. The narrower the gradient, the higher the likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted Quality of evidence The higher the quality of evidence, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted Resource allocation The higher the costs of an intervention \u2014that is, the greater the resources consumed \u2014the lower the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted Values and preferences The more values and preferences vary, or the greater the uncertainty in values and preferences, the higher the likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted 27 Proton Beam Therapy Draft for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 11/12 /2015 Very low : The subcommittee has very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

PBRT eliminates the exit radiation dose that patients would otherwise receive if treated with Xrays, thereby protecting normal tissue from damaging radiation exposure. This technique allows the oncologist to (1) increase the dose delivered to tumo r in order to improve local control (LC) for radiation resistant tumors and/or (2) reduce acute and longterm morbidity by minimizing normal tissue exposure. These benefits translate into not only an improvement in clinical outcomes, but quality of life an d reduction of the short and longterm cost of side effect management due to functional impairment. For these reasons, we feel that it is important that Oregon residents continue to have access to this important weapon for the treatment of cancer. We welco me the opportunity to serve as an ongoing resource to this Commission. Thank you for your comments. A 2 National Coverage Guidance Supporting the Use of Proton Beam Therapy The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines support the use of protons for a variety of malignancies where clinical outcomes with standard therapy is suboptimal. NCCN guidelines are summarized in the document under \"Policy Landscape.\" A 3 Additionally, a number of distinguished national cancer organizations have released model policy guidelines for the judicious and appropriate coverage for PBRT in patients who are most likely to benefit. Specific guidelines are not named by the commenter. The CG document lists guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Net work (NCCN, 2013 -2014), Am erican Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO, 2013), American College of Radiology (ACR, 2011 - 2013), American Cancer Society (ACS), and the Alberta Health Services in Canada (2013). A 4 We also note that the Medicare contractor f or Oregon currently provides for PBRT coverage. Thank you for the information. A 5 The model policy from the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), the preeminent and largest radiation oncology organization, released after the Washington HTA re port, is one that we call your attention as strong initial ASTRO guidelines are considered under the \"Policy Landscape\" HERC Coverage Gu idance - Proton Beam T herapy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February -March, 2015 Page 3 ID # Comment Disposition policy framework for coverage. section of the CG document; a model payer policy is not appropriate for inclusion as evidence. A 6 2014 Washington State Health Care Authority Health Technology Assessment (HTA) The 2014 Washington HTA on PBRT highlighted the need to gather additional clinical data. We agree with this; in fact, 97% of patients treated at our center are enrolled in either a clinical trial or prospective registry. While longterm efficacy and toxicity data is maturing, we routinely utilize dosimetric comparative data to determine appropriate utilization of PBT. For this reason, we feel that excluding all comparative dosimetric studies was a significant methodological flaw in the Washington HTA report. Dosimetric data is routinely utilized for clinical decision making in radiation oncology. In short, if you can deliver greater dose to the tumor or reduce normal tissue exposure, this is expected to benefit our patients. Finally, we strongly encourage you to support payer coverage with clinical evidence generation for disease sites where dosimetric comparisons suggest superiority of PBT, but clinical evidence is not yet available. Dosimetric comparative trials of proton beam therapy would only be applicable to this coverage guidance if conventional modalities (such as IMRT) were one of the treatment arms , or if comparison to conventional radiotherapy were not feasible to obtain. A 7 Summary of Evidence The body of clinical evidence supporting the appropriate use of protons continues to grow. Due to space considerations, we present a small sampling of the evidence. However, we remain available to present a more comprehensive view to this Commission Thank you for presenting additional sources of evidence. A 8 Head & Neck Cancers - A comparative effectiveness study from MD Anderson suggests that use of intensity modulated PBRT in advanced stage head and neck cancer was less costly an d of higher value than IMRT [Frank et al, Oncology Payers 2014] (1). Frank et al is a costing analysis comparing the experiences of two individual patients . Oncology Payers is not a peer - reviewed journal and is not identified by MEDLINE\u00ae , it does not meet the standard for inclusion . A 9 A metaanalysis evaluating the role of photons and charged particle therapy for sinonasal carcinoma demonstrated improved diseasefree survival (DFS) and LC with charged particle therapy; subgroup analysis comparing IMRT and PBRT confirmed that 5year DFS was significantly higher at five years for patients receiving PBRT (72% versus 50%) [Patel et al, Lancet Oncol 2014] (2). Patel 2014 was published after the WAHTA, which judged evidence to be insufficient on head & neck c ancers. It is a MA of 43 cohorts. A subgroup analysis comparing proton beam HERC Coverage Gu idance - Proton Beam T herapy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February -March, 2015 Page 4 ID # Comment Disposition therapy with intensity - modulated radiation therapy showed significantly higher disease -free survival at 5 years (relative risk 1\u00b744, 95% CI 1\u00b701 - 2\u00b705; p=0\u00b7045) follow -up (1\u00b726, 1\u00b705 -1\u00b751; p=0\u00b7011). Authors encourage prospective study with patient -oriented outcomes to confirm findings . This level of evidence is generally not considered sufficient to guide coverage ; however, the subcommittee discus sed that RCTs may not be feasible or ethical in this setting and that reduced harms in treatment of sinonasal carcinoma with PBT would justify a recommendation for coverage. A 10 Breast Cancer - A recent populationbased study of 2168 woman, [Darby et al N Engl J Med. 2013] (3) found that collateral radiation exposure to the heart during breast cancer Xray treatment increases the subsequent rate of ischemic heart disease. Darby et al conducted a case - control study of major coronary events in patients who underwent radiotherapy for breast cancer from 1958 to 2001 in Sweden and Denmark. This was prior to modern advances in radiotherapy when radiation doses are general ly lower, and does not address comparative safety of PBT . HERC Coverage Gu idance - Proton Beam T herapy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February -March, 2015 Page 5 ID # Comment Disposition A 11 PBRT can significantly reduc e this exposure. Macdonald et al reported the results of a prospective trial of protons after mastectomy for patients with excellent clinical outcome and significant reduction in heart dose when compared to Xrays. [Macdonald et al Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2013] (4) MacDonald et al is a noncomparative study of 12 individuals receiving PBT for breast cancer. While a lower heart dose theoretically will decrease future toxicity, study authors concluded \"it is too early to determine cardiopulmonary toxicities in our study\" as follow -up was conducted at 4 and 8 weeks. A 12 Prostate Cancer - In a recent publication from the University of Florida, 5 year outcomes from 3 prospective trials of PBT for prostate cancer were reported. Five ye ar rates of biochemical and clinical freedom from disease progression were 99%, 99%, and 76% in low, intermediate, and high risk patients, respectively. Reported toxicity rates were low. These results compare very favorably with those published for IMRT. [ Mendenhall et al, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 2014] (5). We highlight our the ongoing \"PartiQOL\" randomized trial comparing IMRT vs protons for prostate cancer. The Mendenhall study is a noncomparative observational study of 211 patients ; its early outcomes (2012) are included in Table 13, Appendix F (single -arm case series) of the WA HTA report . A 13 The True Cost of Protons In addition to the significant and growing body of clinical evidence, the costeffectiveness of PBRT ha s also been explored. We would highlight that although PBRT is more resourceintensive to deliver upfront, it is aligned with the judicious use of health care dollars. Several recent studies, including these from Harvard have shown that when the costs of s ideeffects are accounted for, PBRT actually significantly reduces health care costs when compared to standard radiation therapy. Therefore, protons when used appropriately are costeffective when compared to photon beam radiotherapy due to reduced hospitalization rates, etc. for side effect management.

Mailhot -Vega 2015 is a Markov cohort -simulation model looking specifically at growth -hormone deficiency in pediatric cancers. A 14 We urge the Commission to support the coverage of proton therapy and welcome the opportunity to serve as an ongoing resource as you are assessing this promising cancer therapy option for Oregonians. Thank you for your comments . B 15 I am commenting on the proposed policy regarding Proton Therapy. Thank you for your comments. B 16 I was diagnosed in February 2012 with prostate cancer aft er having a biopsy. My PSA reading had been climbing the previous 2 years and when it reached 10.7, I had the biopsy done. The biopsy showed that I had cancer. My urologist, who was a surgeon, suggested having surgery in August of 2012. He also set me up t o speak to a radiation oncologist. I had a CT & Pet scan plus explanations on the different forms of radiation treatments that were available, conventional x -Thank you for your comments.

Also at this time I joined a local prostate support group. I spoke with the men in the support group plus other men I had met that had prostate cancer to find out how they were doing. I spoke with the men who had surgery or either of the two forms of radiation treatments done. Many of them had procedures done years before. None had Prot on Therapy or had heard of it. Every single man I spoke with, no matter how healthy they were or how well their procedure went were still having some form of issue. The two main areas of problems were incontinence and sexual function. They had different de grees of problems, from slight to serious, but all of them had something. patient -reported quality of life among 185 men treated for prostate cancer. \" No differences in overall QoL or general health status were observed at 18 months of follow -up\" (p 13). B 17 I spoke with a former vice president of my company who was treated for prostate cancer 6 years before at Loma Linda with Proton Therapy. He has had no long -term side effects. When he did his research he talk to over 100 Proton Therapy patients and came to the conclusion that because of the minimal long term side effects it was the best way to go. So I started researching on the Internet an d found the same information about the lack of side effects with Proton Therapy. Also, at that time I found out that a Proton Therapy facility was being built in Seattle and would open spring of 2013. I made my decision that this was the best way to go. I went for 9 weeks of treatment; I continued to work the whole time not missing a single day. I went to work in the morning, went for treatments during midday, and then returned to work after treatment. I had no issues during treatment. By the way, I am a bi cycle commuter (year round), I ride round trip 14 miles a day for work and I continued to do this even during my treatments. My wife would pick me up and take me to treatments. I am also an avid cross -country skier during the winter months. Thank you for y our comments. B 18 My urologist had told me that if I had done surgery I would be off work for about 3 months, if I had selected x -rays or seeds I would be off work also for a period of time. Since the end of my treatments I have had 6 follow up PSA test s and my reading keeps going down. It is 0.52 now from the high of 10.7. I have had absolutely no side effects from the Proton treatment since completing treatment in June 2013. I continue to ride my bike to and from work each day. Each August I do a bike ride of 186 miles, which I do with my son each year. No problems. I don't believe I would be doing any of this or enjoying it as much if I had incontinence issues. Try biking or skiing wearing some form of diaper. Can it be done, yes. Would it be enjoyable , probably not. There has been no change in my health from before Proton treatment to now, except the lack of cancer. Is Proton Therapy the right treatment for everyone? I can't answer that, only a doctor or a person with prostate cancer can answer that. B ut in my case I thank God I found out about it and decided to go that route for treatment. Thank you for your comments. B 19 One thing I keep noticing about this whole debate about insurance companies not wanting to pay for Proton Therapy is it seems to come down to cost. Yes, proton Therapy is more expensive than the other more \"accepted\" forms of cancer treatment, but does anyone actually look at the long term cost from the possible long -term side effects of surgery, x - rays or seeds? I have never seen i t mentioned anywhere. Quite frankly it seems no one really cares about the cost of side effects once the patient is out the door. But to me having to spend the rest of my life possibly in diapers or on some other form of medicine for side effects did not t hrill me at all. By the way I am 61 years old. I plan on being around for quite a while longer. Cost and cost -effectiveness analyses, including costs of adverse effects, are considered in the CG document.

Thank you for your comments. C 21 After reviewing the commission's draft on coverage guidance for proton beam therapy (PBT), I would like to highlight and summarize the pertinent, existing evidence supporting the selective use of protons as part of lymphoma treatment. Thank you for your comments. C 22 Lymphoma is a heterogeneous disease entity comprised of Hodgkin (HL) and non -Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). As such, the decisio n on which radiation technique is best suited for a patient (e.g. PBT vs IMRT/VMAT vs 3D vs other) incorporates multiple variables including patient age, tumor location, and histology. Thank you for your comments. C 23 The commission is correct that curr ently no clinical outcomes data exists comparing photons and protons among HL or NHL patients. In HL patients, in whom the goal is to minimize morbidity and toxicity without compromising already excellent cure rates, the outcomes of interest (e.g. cardiova scular disease [CVD], second malignancy [SM]) generally require at least a decade of follow -up as no intermediate biomarker currently exists as a short -term endpoint. Thank you for your comments. It is noted that improvements in long -term toxicities will t ake time to appear in trials. C 24 Up to 75% of HL patients have disease in the thorax, and the long -term radiation -associated morbidity to this area has been clearly documented including increased rates of cardiac events (1), decreased lung function (2), breast cancer (3), lung cancer (4) and esophageal cancer (5). Furthermore, in these studies, the risk of a SM increased with increasing radiation dose to the lung, breast, or esophagus (i.e. linear no threshold), implying that the lower the radiation dos e to these structures, the lower the risk of SM. Thank you for providing these data on the risk of secondary malignancy in treatment of Hodgkin s lymphoma. C 25 Risk of toxicity appears related to the radiation dose to and volume of normal thoracic struct ure irradiated (2, 6) and likely will decline in the future as radiation dose and target volumes (i.e. involved -node versus involved field radiation) are currently being reduced. Nonetheless, radiation technique (PBT vs other) may still play an important role as dosimetric com parative studies using modern radiation target volumes and dose demonstrate that, on average, PBT was associated with lower dose to the heart, lungs, and breasts compared with 3D conformal and VMAT photon techniques (7). Based on risk estimates, proton tec hnique was associated with the lowest life -years lost (7). Other dosimetric comparison studies have also shown similar, significant reduction of dose to the heart (8), breast (9, 10), lung (9, 10 ), and total body (9). Commenter provides background informat ion on risk of damage to surrounding structures with conventional radiation, and posits that PBT provides lower dose to such structures. C 26 Thus far, the early results of involved -node radiation with protons demonstrate excellent relapse -free and event -free survival (11), suggesting that target volume coverage and local control is not compromised by using a more conformal technique. Admittedly, the ten to twenty year -local control, event -free survival, overall survival, and late toxicity after treatment with involved -node proton radiation, as compared with 3D conformal photon radiation, will be the gold standard on which to base clinical decisions and cost -effective analyses. Cost can be calculated over various time periods, but arguably for lymphoma pat ients, this time period should be evaluated over at least 20 -30 years, which is Commenter notes that Hodgkin s patients can expect to live decades, making late toxicity an important outcome. However, late toxicity would also be a concern for other cancers that HERC Coverage Gu idance - Proton Beam T herapy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February -March, 2015 Page 8 ID # Comment Disposition when late effects of treatment may manifest and impact the patient, medical system, and society from a productivity and financial standpoint. By reducing dose to normal organ s tructures without compromising oncologic outcomes, protons may, in the long term, be associated with less cost secondary to fewer complication rates. Until then, I would urge you to consider the existing, preliminary data suggesting the dosimetric advantag es of protons for treatment of lymphoma. Rapid adoption of reduced target volumes (e.g. involved -node radiation) among the radiation oncology community has, in part, been driven by the basic understanding that reducing dose to surrounding normal tissues wi ll decrease acute and late morbidity for our patients. occur in early adulth ood with a high likelihood of survival. Recommendation for noncoverage was made due to lack of comparative clinical outcomes data. In cases where clinical outcomes data could be obtained, dosimetric information was felt to be inadequate to demonstrate a superior clinical outcome. C 27 Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any additional questions, clarifications, or concerns. Thank you for your comments . D 28 I support and encourage your covering proton radiation therapy for all forms of cancer or at least liver cancer where it has proven to be efficacious. I encourage you to begin covering it now, not in 3, 5, 10 years. A very close friend of our's sister needs this therapy immediately. She needs your help. She is 'covered' by Regence Blu e Shield OR. After all, is that not what insurance is for. Thank you Commenter addresses Regence; nevertheless, thank you for your comments. E 29 Please set the example for the country. We have these therapies that give people hope to live longer, yet we make it such a fight. Not fair to family and sick person.

F 30 Please cover proton therapy for all forms of cancer, or at very least, liver cancer. Our close friend's sister from Medford is dying of liver cancer, has been approved for proton therapy, but pending insurance coverage decision by Oregon. Thank you for your consideration of this live saving request. Commenter is a resident of Washington State. Thank you for your comments. G 31 Between 1984 and 1988 I was a faculty member in the department of Radiation Oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. My primary clinical responsib ility was proton radiation treatment at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory which was the first proton facility in the US. Subsequently I spent 18 years in the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Since 2006 I h ave been in a community practice in Corvallis. Oregon. Thank you for your comments. G 32 Through my years in practice I have used virtually all types of radiation treatments available for treating malignancies. Thank you for your comments. HERC Coverage Gu idance - Proton Beam T herapy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February -March, 2015 Page 9 ID # Comment Disposition Protons have the very significant advantage of delivering the lowest integral dose to a patient; in other words, normal tissues receive less dose with protons than with any other type of radiation including intensity modulated photon radiation treatments. Randomized control studies and nonrandomized comparative studies as discussed in the HERC document show at least equivalent tumor control rates for PBT compared to photons in many tumor types with decreased toxicity in some tumor sites. Studies mentioned by commenter are addressed in CG document. G 33 Decreased integral dose with PBT has considerable advantages in pediatric malignancies. Growth and development are adversely impacted by radiation. PBT causes less injury. The HERC documen t describes several studies demonstrating the benefits of PBT in pediatric patients. Secondary malignancy reduction takes many years of followup to study. Preliminary data as cited in this document indicates a reduction in secondary malignancy. As noted on Table 1, PBT was judged to have incremental net health benefit for pediatric cancers. G 34 Primary brain, skull base and spinal malignancies also benefit from PBT because of decreased integral dose. The physical/spatial characteristics of PBT allow sufficient dose to be delivered to skull base and primary spinal malignancies. All parts of the brain perform important functions. PBT reduces dose to uninvolved areas of the brain in primary brain tumor treatment. This benefit in neurological function can be difficult to demonstrate using standard methods, but with sufficiently sensitive measurements improved function would mostly likely be seen. As noted on Table 1, PBT was judged to have incremental net health benefit for adult brain/spinal tumors. G 35 I strongly suggest that HERC reconsider their coverage recommendations to align with the Washington State HTCC recommendations. Thank you for your comments. H 36 Thank you for the opportunity to submit scientific information on Proton Beam Radiation The rapy (PBRT). PBRT eliminates the exit radiation dose that patients would otherwise receive if treated with X -rays, thereby protecting normal tissue from damaging radiation exposure. This technique allows the oncologist to (1) increase the dose delivered to tumor in order to improve local control (LC) for radiation resistant tumors and/or (2) reduce acute and long -term morbidity by minimizing normal tissue exposure. These benefits translate into not only an improvement in clinical outcomes, but also quality of life and reduction of the short and long -term cost associated with side effect management. For these reasons, we feel that it is important that Oregon residents continue to have access to this important weapon for cancer treatment. See comment A1. H 37 PBRT for non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is currently recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Center Guidelines (NCCN V4.2014) and should not be considered experimental, investigational, or unproven. Guidance from professional organizations on PBRT for lung cancer is mixed. NCCN does recommend; however ACR and Alberta guidelines do not. The SR finds comparable benefits and harms at increased cost; therefore the recommendation HERC Coverage Gu idance - Proton Beam T herapy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February -March, 2015 Page 10 ID # Comment Disposition is to not cover . H 38 Locally Advanced NSCLC : Definitive chemoradiotherapy is the standard of care for locally advanced non -small cell lung cancer, however this treatment has the potential to carry significant toxicity. At present, LC with standard dose radiotherapy in locally ad vanced disease is suboptimal, with 50 -60% patient experiencing relapse of their disease. One approach to improve LC is increasing the radiation dose delivered to the cancer. However, this potential improvement comes at the expense of greater toxicity. Unfo rtunately, attempts at dose escalation with standard X -rays in lung cancer have hit a 'toxicity ceiling' whereby the resulting increased toxicity from dose actually may reduce survival, based upon a recent randomized trial with X -rays (1) . Commenter refere JD et al 2015, demonstrating that 74Gy radiotherapy had no additional benefit and possibly increased mortality compared to 60Gy radiotherapy , or a \"toxicity ceiling .\" H 39 In a phase II trial of dose -escalated PBRT concurrent with chemotherapy for 44 patients with stage III NSCLC, MD Anderson demonstrated reduced the side effects, which permitted safe dose escalation to 74 Gy (2) . The median overall survival time was 29.4 mo nths, compared with 19 months for patients who were treated with 74Gy with X -rays in RTOG 0617. No patient experienced grade 4 or 5 proton -related adverse events. Based upon these promising results, the RTOG has launched a phase III randomized trial of pro tons vs photons (RTOG 1308) for local ly advanced NSCLC. Our center is participating in this trial. Commenter notes ongoing research on PBRT in locally - advanced NSCLC given evidence of superior tumor control when 74 Gy is delivered via PBT (Chang 2011, case series of 44 patients) . A Phase III trial is in progress . Three comparative studies discussed in the CG have found that \" rates of treatment - related toxicities with PBT are comparable to those seen with other radiation modalities in patients with lung canc er.\" H 40 Medically Inoperable Early Stage NSCLC: The current standard therapeutic approach for these patients is stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or hypofractionated radiotherapy with photons, which provide excellent results. However, patients with centrally located tumors are at a11 -fold higher risk of high -grade toxicity or death with SBRT due to radiation exposure to the heart and mediastinal structures . (3) Therefore until a \"safe dose\" is established, SBRT with photons is relatively contra indicated in patients with centrally located tumors. Commenter references Timmermann 2006, study of SBRT in 70 patients too frail to undergo surgical resection of NSCLC . Hilar/pericentral location was a strong predictor of high - grade toxicity. No compariso n to PBRT is included. H 41 Bush et al . reported the long -term results of a prospective trial of high -dose hypofractionated PBRT for 111 patients with medically inoperable NSCLC. OS improved with increasing dose (51, 60, and 70 Gy) with a 4 -year OS of 18%, 32%, Commenter notes that SBRT may not be used for centrally located tumors, whereas PBRT HERC Coverage Gu idance - Proton Beam T herapy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February -March, 2015 Page 11 ID # Comment Disposition and 51%, respectively (P=0.006). (4) may improve survival by allowing delivery of higher radiation doses . The studies of PBRT in medically inoperable NSCLC were non-comparative and were included in the review by the Washington HTA. Additionally, there is an ongoing RCT ( NCT00915005 ) comparing photon advanced NSCLC (stages II -IIIb, no specific exclusion of patients with medical ly inoperable tumors). H 42 Additionally, patients with centrally located tumors did not experience excessive or increased toxicity when compared with peripherally located tumor s. (4) This is in contrast to the clinical experience with X -rays. These prosp ective studies demonstrate that protons are safe and effective for patients with centrally located NSCLC who are medically inoperable. This has not yet been demonstrated with X -rays. See comment H41. H 43 Patients with NSCLC who require re -irradiation: Options are limited for patients previously treated with radiation and who subsequently experience intrathoracic NSCLC recurrence. These patients have a poor response to chemotherapy; surgery is extremely high -risk and usually contraindicated. Commenter no tes patients who fail initial radiation have limited options. H 44 Due to their favorable dose -deposition characteristics, protons are uniquely suited to delivery radiation in this clinical setting. The MD Anderson group reported the results on thirty -one patients (94%) who completed reirradiation with protons. At a median 11 months' follow -up, 1 -year rates of overall survival, progression -free survival, locoregional control, and distant metastasis -free survival were 47%, 28%, 54%, and 39%. Rates severe (grade 3) toxicity were 9% esophageal, 21% pulmonary; 1 patient had grade 4 esophagitis, and 2 had grade 4 pulmonary toxicity. These data demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of PBRT in this clinical setting. (5) There is no comparative evidence currently available that demonstrates the superiority of PBRT to other forms of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, or palliative care for intrathoracic recurrence of NSCLC. H 45 The Cost of Protons for Lung Cancer - Patients with lung cance r experience significant toxicity with standard X -ray based therapy. Commenter references evidence of toxicity above, see H 40. H 46 Emerging data demonstrate that protons, when used appropriately, can be cost-effective when compared to photon See comment A 13.

(6,7) H 47 We performed a similar analysis of cost using these methods for lung cancer patients and found that for patients treated with IMRT experiencing high grade pulmonary or esophageal toxicities had costs that exceeded patients treated with protons without this toxicity. Commenter notes internal analysis demonstrating cost savings with decreased toxicity. Reference to publication not provided. H 48 We urge the Commission to support the coverage of proton therapy for lung cancer and welcome the opportunity to serve as an on -going resource as you are assessing this promising cancer therapy option for Oregonians. Thank you for this opportunity. Thank you for your comments. J 54 Thank you for the opportunity to submit scientific information on Proton Beam Radiati on Therapy (PBRT). I am writing this letter to you in my capacity as Chairman of the Department of Radiation Medicine at Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU). At the present time, OHSU does not have a proton beam facility and we do not derive any finan cial benefit from the delivery of proton beam radiation to patients in Oregon. However, we feel that it is important that Oregon residents have access to this important weapon for the treatment of cancer and have sent a number of our patients to proton bea m facilities in other states. We send these select patients for proton radiation because we feel strongly that it is in their best clinical interest. While we do not feel that all patients benefit from protons, there are patients, especially pediatric pati ents in whom protons allow us to reduce risk of normal tissue injury due to radiation exposure in a manner that simply is not achievable with X -rays. Thank you for your comments. J 55 National Coverage Guidance Supporting the Use of Proton Beam Therapy I would like to highlight that a number of distinguished national cancer organizations have released model policy guidelines for the judicious and appropriate coverage for PBRT in patients who are most likely to benefit. I would call to your attention that the current draft of the HERC guidelines are out of step with these guidelines. Guidelines from several organizations are included in the CG document under the \"Policy Landscape\" section and were considered by the HTAS . J 56 The model policy from the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), the pre -eminent and largest radiation oncology organization, released after the Washington HTA report, is one that we call your attention as a strong initial policy framework for coverage. See comment A 5. J 57 I would strongly encourage you to support payer coverage with clinical evidence generation for disease sites where dosimetric comparisons suggest superiority of PBT, but clinical evidence is not yet available. The value of this approach is highlighted in the article by Bekelman and Hahn in the Journal of Clinical Oncology (Bekelman and Hahn, JCO 2014). Commenter suggests recommendation for coverage with evidence development. Discussion of coverage with evidence development and/or reference pricing is not in the HERC Coverage Gu idance - Proton Beam T herapy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February -March, 2015 Page 13 ID # Comment Disposition purview of this subcommittee . J 58 Summary of Evidence The body of clinical evidence supporting the appropriate use of protons continues to grow. Due to space considerations, I am presenting a small sampling of the evidence. Thank you for your comments. J 59 Pediatric Tumors: In a landmark article, O effinger et al [N Engl J Med, 2006] showed that pediatric patients had between 5-10 times the risk of developing severe health complications after radiotherapy compared to their untreated siblings. For medulloblastomas where the radiation treatment involves the brain and spinal cord, data from MD Anderson shows that the ratio of relative risk (RRR) (proton/photon) of cardiac mortality ranged from 0.12 to 0.24. Obviously this is a substantial reduction in risk of injury and mortality in pediatric patients receiving proton beam radiotherapy [Zhang, Rad & One, 2014] Oeffinger 2006 refers to the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study , a retrospective study of 10,397 survivors and 3034 sibling s, which assessed incidence of chronic health conditions among cancer survivors compared to cancer - free siblings. Zhang 2014 is a treatment planning study of 17 pediatric medulloblastoma patients. \"Passively scattered proton CSI provides superior predicted outcomes by conferring lower predicted risks of second cancer and cardiac mortality than field - in-field photon CSI for all medulloblastoma patients in a large clinically representative sample in the United States, but the magnitude of superiority depends strongly on the patients' anatomical development status.\" HTAS has chosen to recommend coverage of PBT for pediatric patients. J 60 In the case of rhabdomyosarcomas of the head and neck, particularly the orbit, proton radiotherapy allows the Childs 2012 is included in the HERC Coverage Gu idance - Proton Beam T herapy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February -March, 2015 Page 14 ID # Comment Disposition treatment of the tumor with much less dose to the brain and growing bones of the skull. Childs et al [lnt J Radiat Oneal Bioi Phys, 2012] reported on 17 patients with parameningeal tumors treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital and found local control rates simi lar to historical treatments with photon radiotherapy but with fewer side effects. Similar considerations apply when treating neuroblastomas and Wilms tumors where standard photon treatments give higher radiation doses to the bowel and kidneys than would b e delivered with protons. WAHTA report. J 61 Brain tumors as a class are the most common pediatric solid tumor. Merchant et al reviewed neurocognitive data for patients treated at St. Jude's, correlated this with radiation doses delivered to various areas of normal brain, calculated the doses that would have been delivered with proton radiotherapy and concluded that the reduced dose afforded by proton radiotherapy resulted in significantly less IQ deterioration than standard radiotherapy [Merchant et al, Pediatr Blood Cancer, 2008]. The referenced study collected radiation dose data for 40 patients, estimated dose that would have been received with PBRT, and applied a model of cognitive impact. The model suggests PBRT may hav e a lower cognitive impact for pediatric brain tumors. Comparative trials on this outcome are unlikely due to lack of clinical equipoise. The subcommittee recommended coverage of PBT for pediatric tumors. J 62 Head & Neck Cancers -A meta -analysis evaluating the role of photons and charged particle therapy for sinonasal carcinoma demonstrated improved disease -free survival (DFS) and LC with charged particle therapy; subgroup analysis comparing IMRT and PBRT confirmed t hat 5 -year DFS was significantly higher at five years for patients receiving PBRT (72% versus 50%) [Patel et al, Lancet Oncol 2014]. See also comment A 9 regarding Patel 2014 . PBT for sinonasal carcinoma is recommended for coverage. J 63 Breast Cancer -A recent population -based study of 2168 woman, [Darby et al N Engl J Med. 2013] found that collateral radiation exposure to the heart during breast cancer X -ray treatment increases the subsequent rate of ischemic heart disease. PBRT can significantly reduce this exposure. Macdonald et al reported the results of a prospective trial of protons after mastectomy for patients with excellent clinical outcome and significant reduction in heart dose when compared to X -rays. [Macdonald et al lnt The Cost of Protons for Children -The cost -effectiveness of PBRT in pediatric malignancies has been explored. We would highlight that although PBRT is more resource -intensive to deliver upfront, it is aligned with the judicious use of health care dollars. Lundqvist et al examined the cost of proton beam radiotherapy for childhood medulloblastoma and found that proton therapy was associated with \u20ac23,600 in cost savings and 0.68 additional quality -adjusted life -years per Lundkvist 2005 is discussed extensively in t he WAHTA report used for this CG.

The analyses showed that reductions in IQ loss and GHD contributed to the greatest part of the cost savings and were the most important parameters for cost -effectiveness. [Lundqvist et al, Cancer 2005] J 65 We urge the Commission to support the coverage of proton therapy for a broader range of cancers and specifically highlight pediatric tumors and welcome the opportunity to serve as an on -going resource as you are ass essing this promising cancer therapy option for Oregonians. Thank you for taking time to review this letter. Thank you for your comments. K 66 Dear Regence, I am writing to encourage you to examine your policy of not covering Proton Therapy where it has been proven effective, such as in the treatment of liver cancer. I think that all insurers should now be offering coverage for this approach to treating disorders in which it has been shown to be efficacious. Commenter addresses Regence; nevertheless, than k you for your comments. L 67 We are faculty members of the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University of Washington. The majority of our head and neck patients are not treated with protons; we use it selectively in cases where we feel there is a benefit over standard forms of radiotherapy. While the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance Proton Center is one of the sites where our group practices, we have no equity interest in the center. There is no financial incentive for us to treat patients there as opposed to other sites. We would like to call your attention to the following literature: Thank you for your comments. WAHTA included two very small poor -quality comparative cohort studies for head & neck cancer. References submitted by this commenter are all non- comparative. It may be that individual tumor types are rare enough and proximal tissues sensitive enough that comparative studies are not feasible . Following public comment and expert testimony, the subcommittee recommended coverage of PBT for certain head and neck cancers; namely, skull -base tumors, paranasal sinus tumors, and juxtaspinal tumors. L 68 Skull Base Tumors One of the challenges with skull -based tumors is their proximity to the brainstem and optic structures, which can be dose -limiting organs when treating relatively radio resistant histologies such as chordomas and chondrosarcomas. With conventional photon radiotherapy, dose is limited to 55 Gy and associated with an inferior local control ( LC) rate of Commenter notes poor local control rate when dosimetry is limited by nearby organs.

L 70 In the Lo ma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC) series, all \"small and medium size\" tumors without brainste m involvement were controlled with only a 7% incidence of late toxicity.

L 71 Nasopha ryngeal Carcinomas Compared with conventional radiotherapy, use of protons for treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinomas is associated with less dose to the optic structures, brain, and inner ears. Thank you for your comments. L 72 Lin et al reported on 16 patients with recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer who underwent proton reirradiation to 59.4 -70.2 Gy (7). Progression -free survival (PFS) was 50% at two years. Among those patients with \"optimal\" coverage, 2 -year PFS was 83%. No patient had significant CNS toxicity. Reference 7 is a 1999 case series of 16 patients. No comparative data are identified. L 73 Chan et al reviewed outcomes for 17 patients with newly -diagnos ed T4N0 -3 nasopharyngeal tumors treated at either HCL-MGH or the Francis H. Burr Proton Therapy Center with combined proton and photon radiotherapy (8). The median prescribed dose was 73.6 CGE. Ten patients received induction and/or concomitant chemotherap y. LC and overall survival at 3 years were 92% and 74%, respectively. Reference 8 is a 2004 case series of 17 patients treated from 1990 -2002. No comparative data are identified. L 74 Dosimetric comparative studies have demonstrated improved tumor coverag e and conformality with intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) compared to IMRT techniques. Given superior conformality, \"avoidance structures\" such as the spinal cord, inner ear, and middle ear received a 2 -3 times lower median dose than with IMPT (9). Reference 9 is a treatment planning study comparing potential radiation doses in 8 patients using IMRT or PBT. Study looked at planned/hypothetical radiation doses only. L 75 Paranasal Sinus Tumors The close proximity of paranasal sinus tumors to brain and optic structures make these tumors amenable for proton radiotherapy. Among 14 patients with esthesioneuroblastomas treated with protons at Chiba, Japan, between 1999 and 2005, 5 -year actuarial LC w as 84% and overall survival was 93% (10). Reference 10 is a retrospective cohort study of 14 patients treated from 1999 -2005 in Japan. No comparative data are identified. L 76 Chan et al reported on 91 patients with advanced paranasal sinus tumors who rec eived combined photon and proton radiotherapy at the HCL -MGH to a mean dose of 73.6 CGE (11). The 3 -year LC was 83% for cell tumors, and 88% for sarcomas. Reference 11 is a case series of 91 patients treated from 1988 - 2002. No comparative data are identified. L 77 Lastly, outcomes among 1186 patients with paranasal sinus tumors treated with photons were compared with 286 patients treated with charged partic le therapy in a meta -analysis. Overall survival and disease -free survival at 5 years See also comment A9 regarding HERC Coverage Gu idance - Proton Beam T herapy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February -March, 2015 Page 18 ID # Comment Disposition were significantly higher among the charged particle therapy group. Among patients treated with proton radiotherapy versus IMRT, 5 -year disease free survival and loco regi onal control at longest follow -up were higher among the proton radiotherapy group (12). Patel 2014. PBT for sinonasal carcinoma is recommended for coverage. L 78 Juxtaspinal Tumors When tumors are invasive or adherent to critical structures such as the vertebral body, spinal cord, or peripheral nerve roots, complete resection is difficult to achieve. Because the tumor is adjacent to the cord, with conventional radiotherapy techniques, dose to the tumor is limited by the co rd's tolerance to radiation, 50 -55 Gy. The use of protons or other charged particles allows one to wrap the high dose volume around and avoid the spinal cord; tumors can therefore be treated to 70 CGE with proton radiotherapy. It is noted that radiation of juxtaspinal tumors is limited by tolerance of adjacent spinal cord. L 79 Among 51 patients with cervical spine chordomas treated at MGH -HCL, LC was 65% (3). Nowakowski et al described a series of 52 patients with juxtaspinal tumors of varying histologies and locations treated with D -particles at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory; 16 of these were located in the cervical spine (13). The overall LC was 58% for 36 patients with previously untreated lesions. Reference 3 is discussed under comment 69 . Reference 13 is a case series of 52 patients treated from 1976 - 1987. No comparative data are identified. L 80 Oropharyngeal Tumors Using a combination protons and photons in an accelerated fractionation schema, LLUMC treated 29 patients with locally -advanced, oropharyngeal carcinomas (13). The overall, 5 -year actuarial loco regional control rate was 84% (88% primary site, 96% neck nodes); 5 -year disease -free survival was 65%. See comment 79. L 81 Frank et al presented data at the 55th Annual Meeting of the American Society for Radiation Oncology showing that patients with orophalyngeal tumors treated with protons had a substantially lower requirement for feeding tubes during therapy than a comparable group of patients treated with IMRT (20% vs. 48%) and less nausea, emesis, and mucositis. A subsequent repo rt on 15 head and neck cancer patients treated using multifield optimization of IMPT showed only one case of grade 3 mucositis in the posterior oral cavity; there was no grade 2 or higher mucositis in the anterior o ral cavity (15). Reference 15 is a case series of 15 patients, reporting \"the first clinical experience and to xicity of multifield optimization (MFO) intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for patients with head and neck tumors.\" No comparative data are identified.

We are concerned that the HERC Coverage Guidance is overly restr ictive, inconsistent with current literature, and will have a detrimental effect on vulnerable populations who derive the most benefit from access to proton beam therapy. Thank you for your comments. M 84 Proton beam therapy (PBT) is neither a new nor an experimental technology for treating cancer with radiation. It utilizes proton radiation particles to deliver highly conformal radiation therapy to a specific tumor target area while giving a much lower dose to the normal tissues in the proton beam's path of entry and exit. PBT's reduced radiation dose to healthy tissues can reduce side effects for patients with demonstrated effectiveness in increasing quality of life. To date, scientific evidence exists confirming that PBT is particularly useful in a numb er of pediatric cancers, particularly those in the brain, as well as for certain adult cancers, such as ocular melanoma, chordoma, chondrosarcoma, and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients with genetic syndromes and those with tumors near the spinal c ord with previous irradiation also benefit from the use of PBT. Additional research on other cancer disease sites, such as breast, prostate and lung, is ongoing with NCI -supported clinical trials currently accruing patients in all three disease sites at th e more than 14 proton therapy treatment centers around the country. This information is correct and consistent with the CG report. HERC Coverage Gu idance - Proton Beam T herapy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February -March, 2015 Page 20 ID # Comment Disposition M 85 In June 2014, ASTRO released a PBT Model Policy that identifies cancer diagnoses that meet ASTRO's evidence -based stan dards that should be covered by private insurers and Medicare. This Model Policy recommends two coverage groups for PBT: 1) patients with specific diagnoses for which PBT has been proven to be effective; and 2) patients with cancer diagnoses where there is a need for continued clinical evidence development and comparative effectiveness analyses for the appropriate use of PBT. For the patients in group two, coverage with evidence development is recommended for patients if they are enrolled in clinical trials or a multi -institutional registry to collect data and inform consensus on the role of proton therapy. Please see comment 5. M 86 The HERC Coverage Guidance is especially concerning because it declines to provide coverage for pediatric malignant tumors. PBT is an important treatment option for certain pediatric tumors, since damage to the surrounding normal tissues in children can produce serious long -term side effects on the growth and development of vital organs and tissues. A growing body of literature shows the late effects, quality of life, and cost effectiveness of proton beam therapy on pediatric patients. Randomized studies are not feasible given the general acceptance of PBT for pediatric patients within the expert community. To account for this, research compares these patients to appropriate historical cohorts. These studies are relatively \"small\" due to low incidence of these diseases; however, data are being collected prospectively for all children in single and multi -institutional databases. (1) It is noted that comparative studies are unlikely to be conducted in pediatric tumors due to lack of clinical equipoise. The subcommittee recommended coverage of PBT for pediatric tumors. M 87 Additionally, we are unaware of any coverage policies that deny coverage of PBT for pediatric tumors, and we are concerned that the denial of PBT coverage for pediatric patients will considerably restrict children's access to curative and palliative treatment. ASTRO strongly recommends that HERC extend covera ge to include primary or benign solid tumors in children, per the ASTRO PBT Model Policy. Thank you for your comments . M 88 PBT has attracted significant attention due to its relative cost, which is usually higher than traditional external beam radiation therapy. However, studies now suggest that proton therapy can be a cost -effective strategy for the management of certain cancers. (2, 3, 4) In one study, proton beam therapy was proven to be associated with higher quality -adjusted life years and lower cos ts. (5) The cost studies referenced were considered in the WAHTA report on which our CG is based. M 89 Furthermore, we are concerned that in developing this coverage guidance, HERC did not consult the opinions of experts in the field nor did they review the full body of evidence surrounding proton beam therapy as an effective form of cancer treatment. We are very surprised that the ASTRO PBT Model Policy, which was carefully developed by leading radiation oncologists and medical physicists and benefitted from balanced input from experts in proton therapy, was not cited as a reference in the HERC Coverage Policy for Proton Beam Therapy. The coverage guidance process solicits expert input as well as public comment such as this one. Please see comment 5 regarding ASTRO. M 90 ASTRO is committed to providing evidence -based guidance to payers in the form of recommendations for correct coverage policies for radiation oncology. We encourage HERC to follow the lead of many national private and public insurers by consulting the evidence and following the recommendations in ASTRO's PBT Model Policy when developing coverage policies for PBT.

N 92 Dear Oregon Health Evidence Review Commission: As a Radiation Oncology faculty member at the University of Washington, I specialize in caring for patients of all ages with central nervous system tumors. A minority of my patients are treated with proton bea m therapy. For these patients, proton beam therapy provides the best chance of curing their brain tumors while minimizing significant side effects. Proton beam therapy has no exit radiation dose, which patients would otherwise receive if treated with x -rays. This is especially important in the central nervous system where very low doses of radiation to normal brain can cause neurocognitive decline, hormonal deficits, and secondary malignancies. For spinal cases, low dose radiation to the anterior organs is associated with nausea and lower blood counts in the short term; and heart disease and secondary malignancies in the long term. Thank you for your comments . N 93 The Washington Health Technology Assessment recently issued a final report where they universally recommended that proton beam therapy for brain/spinal cancers be covered by state insurance. This was based on finding equal benefit and decreased harm for proton beam therapy over conventional therapy. In addition, many other coverage policies agree with this recommendation, and I urge you to do the same. The WAHTA evidence report formed the basis for this CG document. Following the evidence report and public comment, the Health Technology Clinical Committee voted unanimously to recommend cover age of PBT with conditions, namely: - Ocular tumors - Pediatric cancers (e.g., medulloblastoma, retinoblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma) - Central nervous system tumors (e.g. brain, spinal and paraspinal tumors) - Other non -metastatic cancers with the following conditions: a) Patient has had prior HERC Coverage Gu idance - Proton Beam T herapy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February -March, 2015 Page 22 ID # Comment Disposition radiation in the expected treatment field with contraindication to all other forms of therapy, and b) At agency discretion Following public testimony and expert input, the subcommittee recommended coverage of PBT for ma lignant brain and spinal tumors. N 94 Summary of Evidence Pediatric central nervous system cancers: Children have developing tissues that are exquisitely sensitive to radiation. Though long term survival is now achieved in the majority of patients, side effects from radiation therapy can have a profound effect on quality of life in survivors. Please see comments 59 and 61. N 95 In a study of patients receiving irradiation for a brain tumor before than age of four, only a third of adult survivors were able to have full -time employment. (1) Modeling of the effect of radiation therapy on IQ predicted a significant decrease in neurocognitive decline for older children as well. (2) Reference 1 is a case series of 222 children treated from 1958 - 1995. Referen ce 2 is addressed in comment 61. N 96 In a St Jude study of children treated for brain tumors, 94% had resulting growth hormone deficiency, 50% had hypothyroidism, and 43% had adrenal insufficiency.3 Proton therapy can decrease the pituitary dose for man y cases.2 Please see comment 61. N 97 Protons allow for sparing of the cochlea, resulting in lower ototoxicity rates. (4) Reference 4 is considered in the WAHTA evidence review. N 98 Finally, a recent study of pediatric patients with retinoblastoma showed that the 10 year cumulative incidence of secondary malignancy was 14% in patients treated with photons versus 0% in patients treated with protons. This supports the conclusion that protons will decrease the risk of secondary malignancy, which is 20. 5% in 5 year survivors of childhood cancer. (5) Reference for the comparative study of retinoblastoma treatment is not provided. Reference 5 is a case series of 14,359 survivors of child hood cancers; the 20.5% figure is correct . N 99 Adult low grade gli omas: Recent multicenter randomized trials have shown median survival for patients with grade II Reference 6 is a phase III trial HERC Coverage Gu idance - Proton Beam T herapy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February -March, 2015 Page 23 ID # Comment Disposition gliomas (both astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma) and grade III oligodendroglioma to now be greater than fourteen years with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. (6, 7) However, adult low grade glioma survivors have poor cognitive function when receiving postoperative radiation therapy, which limits their ability to work and decreases their quality of life. (8) A recent prospective phase II trial of proton beam th erapy for low grade gliomas showed no evidence of overall decline in cognitive function or quality of life based on neurocognitive assessment and patient questionnaires. (9) comparing chemotherapy + radiotherapy vs radiothe rapy alone in 291 patients. Median survival was not different between groups for the whole cohort. The 14 -year figure applies to patients with codeleted tumors only, which was not a predefined subgroup analysis. Reference 7 is an editorial describing long -term follow up results of the same study. Reference 8 is a cross -sectional study comparing self -reported cognitive function in 195 low - grade glioma survivors with 100 low-grade hematological patients and 195 healthy controls. The authors conclude that \"O ur findings suggest that the tumour itself has the most deleterious effect on cognitive function and that radiotherapy mainly results in additional long - term cognitive disability when high fraction doses are used.\" Reference 9 is a prospective single -arm c ohort study of 20 patients followed for 5 years after proton therapy. No overall decline in cognitive function was detected.

N 100 Adult benign brain tumors (e.g. meningioma, vestibular schwannoma, pituitary adenoma): Multiple series document the outcomes therapy for the treatment of meningioma (10-13), pituitary adenoma (14), and vestibular schwannoma (15). For patients with benign disease and good long term prognosi s, proton beam therapy decreases the risk of neurocognitive decline, endocrine dysfunction, and secondary malignancy. (16, 17) References 10 -13 are considered in the WAHTA evidence review. Reference 14 was published after the WAHTA review. It is a case se ries of 165 patients with functional pituitary adenoma treated from 1992 -2012. Reference 15 is a case series of 64 patients treated with stereotactic radiation therapy. It did not discuss proton beam. No comparative data are identified.

Recent data suggests that increasing the radiation dose for initial treatment or giving a second course of radiation therapy for recurrent gliomas will improve outcomes. However, past efforts to escalate dose or re -irradiate have resulte d in considerable toxicity. Thus, we are participating in two national cooperative group NRG Oncology clinical trials, BN001 and RTOG 1205 . (19, 20) Both trials use proton therapy with the aim of improving survival for this otherwise devastating disease. beam for GBM are in progress. Studies in progress will be considered after peer review and publication. N 103 Cost effectiveness : Recent studies that modeled the cost of long term effects of radiation therapy for pediatric patients with brain tumors found that proton therapy is overall cost effective. (21, 22) Indeed, in my practice I find that long term survivors of brain tumors may be cured but have considerable late effects including neurocognitive decline and hormonal deficiency that are costly to the patient in terms of their ability to work and to payers in terms of medical care. References 21 and 22 are the two papers by Mailhot Vega; please see comment 13. N 104 I urge the Commission to support coverage of proton therapy for central nervous system tumors and welcome the opportunity to serve as an on -going resource as you are assessing this important cancer therapy option for Oregonians. Thank you for this opportunity. Thank you for your comments . O 105 To: Regence It has come to my attention that your insurance does not currently cover proton radiation treatment for all forms of cancer. I am writing to advocate that you at least provide your beneficiaries who have liv er cancer, with this coverage. I hope y ou know that it has proven to be efficacious. Thank you for being responsive to the needs of your beneficiaries. Commenter addresses Regence; nevertheless, thank you for your comments. P 106 Dear Oregon Health Evidence Review Commission: On behalf of the Particle Therapy Cooperative Group - Nmih America (PTCOG -NA)1, we respectfully submit comments on Oregon's Health Evidence Review Commission (HERC) Coverage Guidance on Proton Beam Therapy (PBT). Thank you for your comments. P 107 While we were pleased to see the strong recommendation for coverage of malignant ocular tumors, we have significant concerns with many of the other recommendations. We were especially surprised and disappointed with the lack of a positive coverage recommendation for pediatric mal ignant tumors. Because of the strong evidence supporting its use, PBT for pediatric patients is practically universally covered. Additionally, we strongly disagree with your characterization that \"PBT is far more expensive than its major alternatives.\" Rec ent studies have found that when treating for toxicity and other post -treatment occurrences are considered, PBT has been found to be a cost -effective treatment. We urge you to consider the evidence we provide in this letter in your deliberations. Available cost-effectiveness data have been considered. The HTAS recommended coverage of PBT for pediatric tumors. P 108 Evidence on the Effectiveness of PBT for Pediatric Malignant Tumors The proposed coverage guidance gave a weak recommendation for coverage for pediatric malignant tumors, despite the The HTAS recommended coverage of PBT for pediatric HERC Coverage Gu idance - Proton Beam T herapy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February -March, 2015 Page 26 ID # Comment Disposition overwhelming consensus on its appropriateness for pediatric patients. We believe eliminating coverage of PBT for pediatric patients is inconsistent with the current state of evidence and would be harmful to a pop ulation of patients who would most benefit from the reduced amount of radiation received in the course of PBT treatment. tumors. P 109 Due to the growing body of evidence in this area, most payors, regu lators and providers support the use of PBT for pediatric patients. The consensus is reflected in the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) model policy on PBT which supports its use for primary or benign solid tumors treated in children with cur ative intent (ASTRO, 2014). (1) Examples of published evidence in this area include a recent study of 54 patients with pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma which found that PBT lowers integral dose and improves sparing normal tissue when compared to IMRT [Ladra, MM et al Radiother Oncol 2014]. (2) Please see comment 5 regarding ASTRO . Ladra 2014 is a prospective cohort study of 54 patients who received proton therapy; IMRT plans were generated for comparison . P 110 In another example, a 2012 study of high risk pediatric neuroblastoma found that preliminary outcomes reveal excellent control with proton therapy for this population [Hattagangadi JA, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys, 2012]. (3) While we have cited just two s tudies, these are consistent with other studies of pediatric patients. Hattangadi 2012 was considered in the WAHTA document. P 111 Evidence on the Effectiveness of PBT for Other Sites The proposed guidance concludes, \" ... there was insufficient evidence to obtain even a basic understanding of PBT's comparative clinical effectiveness and comparative value.\" Frankly, we were stunned by this characterization. While we acknowledge (and support) the ongoing development of additional clinical evidence, there i s already significant evidence supporting the effectiveness of PBT that this proposed coverage guidance ignores. In addition to the evidence supporting the use of PBT for pediatric tumors, there is significant evidence supporting its use for other tumor si tes. The CG was based on a WAHTA report that came to th is conclusion.

The HTAS recommended coverage of PBT for pediatric tumors based on reviewing the limited evidence, expert testimony, and the lack of clinical equipoise that means future trials are unlikely to be conducted . P 113 For further evidence, we highlight the multiple national guidelines that support the use of proton therapy. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, the previously cited ASTRO model policy for proton therapy, and the model policy on coverage of proton beam therapy from the National A ssociation of Proton Therapy (NAPT) both approve of the use of proton therapy for certain patients. The basis for these national guidelines is the growing body of evidence supporting the use of proton therapy for positive long -term treatment outcomes and q uality of life for oncology patients. The weight of this evidence is reflected in the numerous Medicare contractors and private payors policies that provide coverage for PBT for a number of anatomical sites. The guidelines cited are included in the CG docu ment, with the exception of the NAPT. Staff were unable to identify guidelines via search of the NAPT website. P 114 PTCOG -NA urges you to postpone finalizing this coverage guidance and reconsider your methodology of reviewing clinical evidence. We offer the assistance of our clinical leadership to assist you with any review. Thank you for your comments. P 115 Evidence on the Cost Effectiveness of PBT An overarching benefit of PBT versus photon therapy is its precise targeting that spares very sensitive adjacent normal tissue, resulting in reductions in toxicity and other negative occurrences post -treatment. We are very concerned that you failed to consider these benefits. A study published in Cancer [Mailhot Vega, RB et al, Cancer 2013] found that by avoiding years of costly side effects, PBT can be cost -effective for children with medulloblastoma. Please see comment 13. P 116 An example of this more comprehensive analysis is a recent study issued by MD Anderson Cancer Center and presented at the October 2014 meeting of PTCOG -NA (manuscript under development). The study found that the cost of PBT when used for accelerated partial breast irradiation to decrease overall treatment time and toxicity, was estimated at $13,833. Results of the study sugge sted that the cost of proton therapy is similar to other types of radiation. Commenter references unpublished data; new published evidence will be considered as the CG enters re - review every 2 years. HERC Coverage Gu idance - Proton Beam T herapy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February -March, 2015 Page 33 ID # Comment Disposition P 117 PTCOG -NA strongly recommends that you include studies that consider cost of toxicity and other post -treatment conditions that can occur and which certainly impact costs and the quality of life of the patient.

Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me Thank you for your comments. Q 119 Dear Oregon HERC, I write this letter requesting your consideration in the coverage of proton therapy for prostate cancer. Thank you for your comments . Q 120 Proton therapy has been in clinical use in the US since the 1970s. There is a long track record establishing safety and efficacy in patients with prostate cancer over decades of experience. Due to the unique physical characteristics of proton beam radiati on (PBT), proton therapy is associated with less dose to surrounding normal tissues in the pelvis (e.g. rectum, bladder) than photon/x -ray IMRT. It allows safe delivery of radiation to the prostate while minimizing side effects. This is correct and consist ent with the background information . Q 121 Two phase III randomized studies established that protons are a safe and effective means to deliver dose -escalated radiotherapy, the current standard of care in prostate cancer. One study by Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) randomized patients with prostate cancer to a higher dose proton boost versus lower dose x -ray boost to the prostate following pelvic radiation with xray s. (1) Another study by MGH and Lorna Linda randomized patients with prostate cancer to a higher dose versus lower dose proton boost in combination with x -ray radiation. (2) Both trials showed an improvement in local control with the higher dose proton boost with a very low risk of GU or GI complications. References 1 and 2 are considered in the WAHTA report. Q 122 A number of single institutional experiences have also reported excellent long term outcomes with proton therapy. Loma Linda reported a series of 1255 patients with prostate cancer treated with either protons or a combination of x- rays and protons. (3) Survival rates were excellent, and the risk of severe GU or GI complications was extremely low. Reference 3 is a retrospective cohort study of 1255 patients treated with proton radiation therapy from 1991 -1997. Authors concluded tha t disease - free survival rates were comparable with other forms of local therapy. Authors also concluded that \" No difference was seen in toxicity between those treated with combined protons and photons (11 of 731) and those with protons alone (6 HERC Coverage Gu idance - Proton Beam T herapy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February -March, 2015 Page 34 ID # Comment Disposition of 524; p = 0.52) . Q 123 More recently, University of Florida reported their 5 -year control rates from 3 prospective PBT trials for prostate cancer: 99%, 99%, and 76% in low, intermediate, and high risk patients, respectively. Among 211 patients, only 1 -2% experienced serious late toxicity. These results compare very favorably with published results for IMR T. (4) Reference 4 is a report of three prospective trials encompassing 211 prostate cancer patients. The data on control rates are correct. Rates of grade 3 GI toxicity were 1.0% and rates of grade 3 urologic toxicity were 5.4%. Within -trial c omparative data are not available ; commenter is referencing historical IMRT data from other publications . Q 124 An advantage of PBT is decreased exposure of normal pelvic tissues to low to moderate dose radiation (0 -50 Gy). Low - dose radiation to pelvic structures is associated with bowel and bladder urgency, frequency, erectile dysfunction and secondary cancers . (5). These side effects can drastically influence a patient's quality of life (QOL). Reference 5 is a retrospective questionnaire study of bowel, urinary, and sexual function in 65 patients who received external beam radiation therapy for localized prostate c ancer. Within -trial c omparative data are not available. Q 125 No randomized, prospective studies exist comparing IMRT and PBT. Several attempted retrospective comparisons have been conducted using large, national databases including SEER, but these studi es suffer from major weaknesses including lack of granular details on side effects such as rectal urgency, poor surrogates for measures of GI toxicity, and comparison based on historical cohorts of small numbers of patients treated with now outdated proton therapy techniques/technology. In one QOL study comparing men treated with IMRT versus PBT, there was less rectal urgency and frequency in men treated with PBT than IMRT . (6) It is noted that prospective randomized studies exist. Reference 6 is a comparis on of QOL data from two different cohort studies, 1243 men receiving PBT and 204 men receiving IMRT. There were no differences in QOL summary scores between the IMRT and PT cohorts during early follow - up (up to 2 -years). Response to individual questions su ggests HERC Coverage Gu idance - Proton Beam T herapy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February -March, 2015 Page 35 ID # Comment Disposition possible differences in specific bowel symptoms. Q 126 Decreases in testosterone, the major male hormone responsible for sex drive and stamina, can adversely affect patient QOL. Minimizing low -dose radiation to the pelvis with PBT has been found to translate into improved ability to maintain normal testosterone levels in patients after treatment compared with x -rays. (7) Reference 7 is included in the WAHTA report. Q 127 Lastly, decreasing integral radiation dose to the body is associated with a reduced risk for secondary cancers. This is particularly important for younger men seeking an alternative to surgery. In a matched -cohort study that included 33% of men treated for prostate cancer, PBT led to a 50% reduction in incidence of secondary canc ers compared to photon - based radiation . (8) Reference 8 is included in the WAHTA report. Q 128 We recognize the importance of generating high level -evidence confirming the benefits of PBT in prostate cancer treatment. We are participating in the ongoing multicenter \"P artiQOL\" randomized trial comparing IMRT vs protons for prostate cancer. Clinical trials like PartiQOL will help quantify the degree of improvement in patient -reported quality of life with PBT over IMRT. In addition, all of our prostate canc er patients are enrolled on a prospective multicenter clinical registry capturing patient reported QOL measures before and after treatment as well as disease control outcomes. Studies in progress will be considered following publication. Q 129 This need for continued clinical evidence development (CED) and comparative effectiveness data is recognized by the current ASTRO national model policy for PBT. (9) Under this policy, enrollment in an IRB approved multi -institutional patient registry that adheres to Medicare requirements for CED is considered an indication for proton therapy that should be covered by an insurance carrier. These important trials cannot not be completed if PBT is not covered. Regardi ng ASTRO, please see comment 5. Regarding CED, please see comment J57. R 130 To Whom It May Concern: This letter is in regards to the Oregon Health Evidence Review Commission coverage guidelines for proton beam therapy. As an assistant professor in the department of radiation oncology at the University of Washington, I sub - specialize in breast cancer and would like to comment on the use of proton beam therapy for breast cancer. Thank you for your comments. R 131 Proton beam therapy is currently being used in the treatment of breast cancer in many proton c enters across the country. The largest, single -institution experience to date using proton beam therapy for breast cancer comes from Loma Linda, where at last publication in 2014, one hundred women with early stage breast cancer had been treated with proto n beam therapy following surgery (lumpectomy) as part of breast -conserving therapy. (1) When compared with 3 -dimensional conformal photon plans for partial breast irradiation, Bush et al. reported a significant reduction in exposure to surrounding normal b reast tissue with proton beam therapy that led to improved cosmetic outcomes. (2) There was also nominally lower radiation dose to the lung and heart with proton. Data from the Loma Linda trial are considered in the WAHTA report. Reference 1 was published after the WAHTA report and reports 5 -year follow up data on this phase 2 trial of 100 patients; results are not significantly different from prior HERC Coverage Gu idance - Proton Beam T herapy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February -March, 2015 Page 36 ID # Comment Disposition publications. R 132 More recently proton beam therapy has been investigated in locally advanced breast can cer. The initial experience from Massachusetts General Hospital was published in 2013 and reported on stage III breast cancer patients that were irradiated with protons after mastectomy to the chest wall and regional lymphatics. (3) A comparative dosimetri c analysis between proton and photon plans demonstrated substantial reductions in both lung and heart exposure as defined by well -established metrics for those organs at risk. In addition, there was improvement in prescription dose coverage to the areas a t risk , i.e. chest wall and regional lymphatics received adequate doses. (4) Acceptable acute toxicity (dermatitis and fatigue) was reported. A separate multi -institutional dosimetric study that compared treated photon/electron plans with created proton pl ans (in press for publication at the time of this letter) confirmed these findings and found superior chest wall and lymphatic coverage and superior normal tissue avoidance in the proton plans. See comment A11. R 133 Currently, there has been little experience in salvage or palliative treatment with proton beam therapy for breast cancer. However, future investigation of its use in the setting of local breast recurrence after previous breast conservation therapy (lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy) is worthwhile, particularly given that the current standard of care is mastectomy for these women. If repeat breast preservation can be safely achieved by utilizing proton beam therapy (via less repeat exposure to previously irradiated breast tissue), this c an have a significant impact on quality of life. No additional evidence is supplied. R 134 No recent cost -effectiveness analyses exist for breast cancer treated with proton beam therapy. However, given the preliminary data described above including lower dose to the heart, lungs, without compromise of target volume coverage, there are potential savings associated with decreased long -term toxicity such as cardiac disease, lung disease and poor cosmetic outcomes. The draft coverage guidelines reference a Sw edish study from 2005 that can serve as a guideline for future analyses, but an updated study with current costs in the United States and new information regarding radiation dose -effect relationships is necessary. Cost comparisons have been performed betwe en proton beam therapy and alternative radiotherapy methods for accelerated partial breast irradiation, particularly single -entry catheter based systems that utilize high -dose rate brachytherapy as the radiation source. An up -to-date cost comparison can r eveal whether there is still a cost advantage with proton beam therapy when using updated (lowered) reimbursement of single -entry catheter techniques. No additional evidence is supplied. R 135 In summary, I believe that the use of proton beam therapy for breast cancer is promising and has provided a significant benefit to the women we have treated. Many others will benefit from proton beam therapy when it becomes a standard treatment option. Thank you for your comments. S 136 Dear Oregon Health Evidence Review Commission: I am a board certified Radiation Oncologist on the faculty of the University of Washington and specialize in the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers. I am writing to you because I utilize Thank you for your comments. HERC Coverage Gu idance - Proton Beam T herapy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February -March, 2015 Page 37 ID # Comment Disposition proton beam therapy (PBT) in select patients w ho may benefit from this technology. Patients with gastrointestinal cancers frequently require multimodality treatments (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy) that are curative. However, these may come at the cost of significant early and late side effects that not only impact patients' quality of life but are also costly to health care systems. Key reasons why radiation therapy for gastrointestinal (GI) cancers is so toxic are the close proximity of critical normal GI organs and their high sensitivi ty to the damaging effects of radiation therapy. S 137 PBT has the unique property of eliminating exit radiation dose that patients would otherwise receive if treated with conventional x -rays. This is especially important in the gastrointestinal system where low to moderate doses of radiation to normal liver, stomach, and bowel cause numerous and potentially debilitating GI side effects, which include but not limited to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and liver failure. This inf ormation is correct. S 138 I urge the Commission to consider the following additional information and data when reviewing their coverage guidelines for GI cancers: Liver cancers In accordance with the recent ASTRO Model Policy for PBT, primary liver cancers are supported as medically necessary when treated in a hypofractionated regimen based on meeting the medical necessity requirements of PBT and on published clinical data. The liver is one of the most highly radiation sensitive organs in the body; l ow to moderate doses of radiation have a profound impact on the normal function of this organ, particularly when the liver is cirrhotic (scarred). PBT allows for safe radiation dose escalation to liver tumors, which has been shown in prospective studies to result in improve survival outcomes. (1) Please see comment 5. S 139 In addition to the prospective studies of PBT as detailed by the HERC, a recently published systematic review and meta - analysis compared data across 70 observational studies and demonstrated that compared to conventional photon radiotherapy, PBT had significantly superior 5 -year overall survival (RR 25.9), progression -free survival (RR 1.86), and locoregional control (RR 4.3). (2) PBT also had significantly less severe acute and l ate toxicities (6.1% vs. 20% and 2.5% vs. 6.9%, respectively) compared to photon radiotherapy. Notably, hepatic toxicity, which is often highly morbid, life - threatening, and costly, was lower in PBT versus photon treated patients (3.1% vs. 9.9%). Reference 2 is a systematic review and meta -analysis as described by the commenter. This was published after the WAHTA report. Carbon -ion therapy was included in the same group as PBT under the category of \"charged particle therapy.\" Survival rates were better than conventional radiotherapy but similar to SBRT. S 140 Furthermore, due to its dosimetric advantages, PBT allows for hypofractionated treatment, particularly for large liver Commenter describes a scenario HERC Coverage Gu idance - Proton Beam T herapy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February -March, 2015 Page 38 ID # Comment Disposition tumors that would not be amenable to conventional fractionation of photon radioth erapy: instead of delivering 40 fractions (8 weeks) of conventionally fractionated photon radiation, PBT can be safely delivered in only 15 fractions (3 weeks) with biologically equivalent doses. As shown in the table below, when using Medicare reimburseme nt rates (professional and technical fees), PBT results in cost savings of approximately 30% when compared to IMRT in this setting: $21,665.63 versus $30,678.93, respectively.

S 141 Pancreatic cancers The Commission did not specifically include the review of evidence of PBT in pancreatic cancers. Radiation treatment with concurrent chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer is associated with significant GI toxicity. With conventional radiation, severe acute GI toxicities occur in up to 20% of pa tients, which can often be treatment -limiting and WAHTA identified no comparative studies of the clinical effectiveness of primary PBT in gastrointestinal cancers. Pancreatic cancer data were HERC Coverage Gu idance - Proton Beam T herapy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February -March, 2015 Page 39 ID # Comment Disposition compromise full completion of treatment. (3) considered under th e category of gastrointestinal cancers. Recommendation is not to cover based on insufficient evidence. S 142 Dosimetric data as well as phase I clinical data demonstrate that PBT for pancreatic cancer is feasible, tolerable, and safer than with photon th erapy. A dosimetric analysis of proton and photon plans for the adjuvant treatment of pancreatic cancer from the University of Florida showed superior small bowel and stomach sparing with PBT. (4) Commenter notes Phase I clinical data, which was not considered in the CG report. Evidence development for pancreatic cancer is ongoing and will be considered in future updates of the CG. S 143 A phase I/II study of 50 patients with locally advanced pancreas cancer used 3 dose fractionation schemes of PBT depending on the location of the tumor in relation to other GI structures with concurrent. They found excellent efficacy compared to historical controls of locally advanced pancreas cancer (1 -yr loca l progression free survival 82%, progression free survival 64%, overall survival 77%). (5) The toxicities were low compared to the above mentioned photon based regimens with acute Grade 3 and higher rates as follows: nausea/vomiting 8%, anorexia 8%, weight loss 5%, and fatigue 3%. Reference 5 is considered in the WAHTA evidence review. S 144 More recent data from University of Florida and University of Pennsylvania provide additional data that PBT is better tolerated than photons. Nichols et al. from University of Florida demonstrated no grade 3 toxicities or treatment interruptions due to toxicity in 22 patients treated with PBT and concurrent chemotherapy. (6) At the University of Pennsylvania, 13 patients with pancreatic cancer treated with concurre nt chemotherapy and proton PBT were compared to a cohort of patients treated during the same time period with photon radiotherapy to similar doses: 24% of the photon patients experienced grade 3 toxicity, whereas only 8% of the PBT cohort had this grade of toxicit y. (7) Reference 6 is considered in the WAHTA evidence review. Reference 7 is a non - randomized comparative study of 13 patients who received proton chemoradiation therapy versus a concurrent cohort of 17 patients who received photon therapy. Rates of toxicity were similar. S 145 In summary, there are adequate data from multiple institutions that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of PBT for liver and pancreatic cancers. The reduction in treatment -related toxicities with PBT compared to photon tr eatment also has the potential to result in cost -savings in these challenging diseases. I urge the Commission to support the coverage of PBT for liver and pancreatic cancers. I welcome the opportunity to serve as an on -going resource as you are assessing Thank you for your comments . HERC Coverage Gu idance - Proton Beam T herapy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February -March, 2015 Page 40 ID # Comment Disposition this important cancer therapy option for Oregonians. T 146 In 2011, I was diagnosed with Non -Hodgkins's Lymphoma (NHL) of the Central Nervous System with a mass found per MRI and CT Scan in the L) parietal dura of the brain & inoperable). I was told this is a rare mass found in only 3% of the population of those with NHL. After numerous lumbar punctures and samples of spinal fluid, bone marrow biopsies and finally an Craniotomy for an open biopsy, I began mega dose chemotherap y over a nine month period. At completion and for 12 months I was considered in remission. But after 14 mo MRI check up, they discovered that the mass was returning. At that point, I was given my options of Radiation (radiotherapy with standard Photons) wi th all it's side affects that would probably include blood brain barrier penetration leaving me with possible irreversible neurological damages, not to mention the probable return of the mass again. There IS limited control with the use of the Photon beams . Thank you for your comments. T 147 Or I could endure another long regime of chemo, this time with IT therapy (Intrathecal). Of which there are often high grade toxicities of blood, liver or renal systems). Especially in folks over 60 years of age. Wow, what a choice! (NOT) Thank you for your comments. T 148 Then, trying to take all this in for a few days, and pretty much deciding not to do any more treatments, I received a call from my Neuro Oncologist at UW Med Center, stating he had just talked to a specialist at the SCCA Proton Center (new to Seattle about a year before) about my case (my mass was wide but very shallow) and the doctor was interested in using their newest form of therapy called Pencil Beam Scanning (the PBS had only been availabl e for a couple of months at that time). He went on to explain that PBS is higher degree of precision of the Proton Beam with overall minimal exposure and radiation to healthy tissues surrounding the mass. So, I spoke with my family and doctors and decided to take a chance. Then I did my research and discovered that Proton Therapy has been around for 25 years in the U.S. and a few other countries and that it was shown to be effective in treating many types of tumors, including cancers of the brain, CNS, head , neck, prostrate, lung and GI system, as well as cancers that cannot be removed (or completely removed) by surgery or chemo. I was again hopeful. Thank you for your comments.

T 150 Feb 10, 2014, the first day I entered the Proton Center in Seattle, I felt like I had 'come home' to a new family of folks who are there to help all their patients feel comfortable in their stress -free and friendly environment, as anywhere I had ever been. The team of radiologists were 'my' team and treated me with respect, humor and a positivity beyond belief. I felt I could share my concerns, emotions and joys with them all. I cried when I had finished my regime of treatments, knowing I wouldn't be seeing them every day again. By the way, my only side affects included some tiredness and hair loss of the area radiated (which has since grown back) and missing 'my team' ! Thank you for your comments.

This would not be the case with the other choices given to me. My daily life during the treatment did not change and I continue d to enjoy daily activities. I can also look forward to the fact that the protons therapy reduces a reoccurrence or secondary mass. I can also live without the thought of residual neurological side affects later in my life. Thank you for your comments. T 152 The facility itself is a 'step into the future' kinda place.

Thank you for your comments. T 153 Being a retired nurse, I can honestly say I have never had a more positive medical experience than that of SCCA Proton Center in Seattle . Believe me, it's different when you're on the receiving end of medical care! Thank you for your comments. T 154 I have recommended it to those I know with medical issues that would benefit from Proton Therapy. I'm happy to say that their treatments an d positive experiences have been the same as mine. We are blessed to have this 'state of the art' facility in our part of the country. The need is great for more compassionate and successful treatments of all types of cancers. It will definitely be the only way of doing radiation therapy in the near future. Thank you for your comments.

A true believer in compassionate and quality care! Thank you for your comments. U 156 Hello, I chose proton therapy because it has low risk of side effects such as incontinence , impotence and bowel urgency. I also chose proton therapy because I can go to work every day and work a full day's work. I have not missed a single day's work during my treatment. I have been able to perform my work normally with some minimal impact, such as some minor urinary urgency. I would absolutely recommend proton therapy for anyone for whom this is a valid therapy. The impact to my body has been mini mal. The treatment here at the SCCA Proton Center in Seattle has been very professional, and my wife and I both felt very encouraged by the whole process, from intake through the daily treatments and the weekly meetings with nurses and my oncologist.

Thank you Thank you for your comments W 158 Dear Oregon Health Evidence Review Commission: I am a Radiation Oncologist on the faculty of the University of Washington and Seattle Children's Hospital. A majority of my patients are children with cancer, and I treat more children with cancer than any other radiation oncologist in the Northwest. About half of my patients are f rom the Seattle area, and the other half come from other parts of Washington, Alaska, Oregon, Montana, Idaho, and British Columbia. Thank you for your comments. W 159 The lack of exit dose with proton radiation can be critical for providing the optimal r adiation therapy for children with developing bodies. It allows the patient to receive the maximum efficacy of treatment with decreased acute and late effects. On 11 July 2014 the Washington Health Technology Assessment adopted its final decision to recomm end universal coverage for pediatric cancers. This information is correct. W 160 Nonetheless the best modality of radiation for each patient is individually assessed. I have treated two children from Oregon with proton therapy; however; I have recently supported the decisions by local Oregon radiation oncologists to treat with photon therapy rather than have them travel for proton therapy. Thank you for your comments. W 161 I am a member of the Children's Oncology Group (COG), the principle US entity fo r clinical research about pediatric cancers. It is noteworthy that most clinical trials that call for radiation other than whole brain radiation (including trials for most brain, Ewings, and rhabdomyosarcoma) allow for the clinician to choose the modality of radiation -proton or photon; it is not a study question on any COG clinical trial. Thank you for your comments. W 162 It is also noteworthy that even in somewhat resource -constrained, more centrally organized health systems, proton therapy for pediatri c patients is increasingly accepted. For example, Britain's National Health Service is constructing two proton facilities that will treat children. This is correct. W 163 It is rare for a pediatric patient not to receive insurance coverage for proton therapy, either with public or private insurance. I urge you to continue support for Oregon pediatric patients to receive proton therapy, particularly when there is consensus between the Oregon radiation oncologist and the proton radiation oncologist. Than k you for your comments. W 164 Other clinicians will focus on the benefits of treating lymphoma (including pediatric lymphomas) with proton therapy, therefore I will focus on pediatric head and neck and central nervous system tumors. Summary of Evidence for Pediatric head and neck and central nervous system cancers: Although children often survive their pediatric cancers, the long term morbidity of treatment, including radiation, can have dramatic effects on quality of life, which can be mitigated with p roton therapy. Although the impact of radiation late effects is most obvious with central nervous system tumors, many of the same considerations apply when treating Thank you for your comments.

W 165 Among the many studies of pediatric patients receiving radiation therapy, some of the most relevant include. Pediatric patients had improved short term morbidity when comparing a cohort of pro ton-treated patients with historical controls. (1) Patients receiving irradiation for a brain tumor before than age of four, only a third of adult survivors were able to have full -time employment. (2) Modeling of proton therapy versus photon therapy showed decreased effect on neurocognitive development and pituitary \u00b7function with proton therapy. (3) Young children with ependymoma treated with protons showed patients exhibited remarkably few side effects in terms of hearing loss, neurocognitive effe cts, and pituitary dysfunction compared to historical controls. (4) Children treated with protons for low grade gliomas showed almost no neurocognitive, endocrine or visual effects of the treatment in follow up. (5) Children with retinoblastoma treated with photon radiation had a 14% 10 year cumulative incidence of secondary malignancies versus 0% in patients treated with protons. (6) Using protons for craniospinal irradiation is likely to mitigate the future risk of breast cancer, ovarian failure, an d hemi disease in adult survivors of embryonal brain tumors. (7 -9) Overall, when including future costs of late effects, proton therapy will be cost -effective compared to photon therapy for medulloblastoma. (10) Proton therapy will be cost -effective based on growth hormone function preservation when it reduces dose to the hypothalamus (11) Reference 1 was published after WAHTA and is a case series of 83 patients 21 years and younger treated 2009 -2012, who were compared to historical controls.

Commenter addresses Regence; nevertheless, thank you for your comments. Y 168 On behalf of the National Association for Proton Therapy (NAPT), we respectfully submit comments on Oregon's Health Evidence Review Commission (HERC) Coverage Guidance on Proton Beam Therapy (PBT). While we were pleased to see the strong recommendation for coverage of malignant ocular tumors, we have significant concerns with many of the other recommendations. We were especially surprised and disappointed with the lack of a positive coverage recommendation for pediatric malignant tumors. Because of the strong evidence supporting its use, PBT for pediatric patients is practically unive rsally covered. Additionally, we strongly disagree with your characterization that \"PBT is far more expensive than its major alternatives.\" Recent studies have found that when treating for toxicity and other post -treatment occurrences are considered, PBT h as been found to be a cost -effective treatment. We urge you to consider the evidence we provide in this letter in your deliberations. Evidence on the Effectiveness of PBT for Pediatric Malignant Tumors The proposed coverage guidance gave a weak recommendat ion for coverage for pediatric malignant tumors, despite the overwhelming consensus on its appropriateness for pediatric patients. We believe eliminating coverage of PBT for pediatric patients is inconsistent with the current state of evidence and would be harmful to a population of patients who would most benefit from the reduced amount of radiation received in the course of PBT treatment. Due to the growing body of evidence in this area, most payors, regulators and providers support the use of PBT for pediatric patients. The consensus is reflected in the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) model policy on PBT which supports its use for primary or benign solid tumors treated in children with curative intent (ASTRO, 2014). Examples of published e vidence in this area include a recent study of 54 patients with pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma which found that PBT lowers integral dose and improves sparing normal tissue when compared to IMRT [Ladra, MM et al Radiother Oncol 2014]. In another example, a 2012 study of high -risk pediatric neuroblastoma found that preliminary outcomes reveal excellent control with proton therapy for this population [Hattagangadi JA, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys, 2012]. While we have cited just two studies, these are consistent w ith other studies of pediatric patients. Evidence on the Effectiveness of PBT for Other Sites The proposed guidance concludes, \" ... there was insufficient evidence to obtain even a basic understanding of PBT' s comparative clinical effectiveness and comp arative value.\" Frankly, we were stunned by this characterization. While we acknowledge (and support) the ongoing development of additional clinical evidence, there is already significant evidence supporting the effectiveness of PBT that this proposed cove rage guidance ignores.

Quality of life outcomes in proton and photon treated pediatric brain tumor survivors. Radiother Oncol. 2014 Oct 7. [Epub ahead of print] For further evidence, we highlight the multiple national guidelines that sup port the use of proton therapy. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, the previously cited ASTRO model policy for proton therapy, and the model policy on coverage of proton beam therapy from the NAPT and endorsed by the Particle Ther apy Co -Operative Group - North America (PTCOG -NA) all support the use of proton therapy for certain patients. The basis for these national guidelines is the growing body of evidence supporting the use of proton therapy for positive long -term treatment outc omes and quality of life for oncology patients. The weight of this evidence is reflected in the numerous Medicare contractors and private payors policies that provide coverage for PBT for a number of anatomical sites. NAPT urges you to postpone finalizing this coverage guidance and reconsider your methodology of reviewing clinical evidence. We offer the assi stance of our clinical leadersh ip to assist you with any review. Evidence on the Cost Effectiveness of PBT An overarching benefit of PBT versus photon therapy is its precise targeting that spares very sensitive adjacent normal tissue, resulting in reductions in toxicity and other negative occurrences post -treatment. We are very concerned that HERC Coverage Gu idance - Proton Beam T herapy Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February -March, 2015 Page 48 ID # Comment Disposition you fai led to consider these benefits. A study published in Cancer [Mailhot Vega, RB et al, Cancer 2013] found that by avoiding years of costly side effects, PBT can be cost -effective for children with medulloblastoma. An example of this more comprehensive analysis is a recent study issued by MD Anderson Cancer Cente r and presented at the October 2014 meeting ofPTCOG -NA (manuscript under development). The study found that the cost of PBT when used for accelerated partial breast irradiation to decrease overall treatment time and toxicity, was estimated at $13,833. Resu lts of the study suggested that the cost of proton therapy is simil ar to other types of radiation. NAPT strongly recommends that you include studies that consider cost of toxicity and other post -treatment conditions that can occur and which certainly impac t costs and the quality of life of the patient. While we appreciate the opportunity to submit comments, we felt very limited in our ability to communicate to you due to the severe limitations on written (1000 word) and oral (3 minutes) comments. We believe the current process may stymie public input. NAPT urges you to reconsider these guidelines.
