If that sounds great to you, continue reading for more natural energy drink options. Let's get started! What Natural Drink Gives You the Most Energy? Generally speaking, there are a variety of natural selections available, and the following are just a few of them. Coconut Water [Coconut water](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/coconut-water-benefits#6.-Beneficial-after-prolonged-exercise), sometimes called the \"nature's sports drink\", is an excellent drink to increase your energy levels. It has high mineral content such as b vitamins, electrolytes, and potassium. The tastiest coconut water comes from young Thai coconuts that have not matured but the ones you can find in your local grocery stores are great too. However, be cautious when purchasing coconut water from anywhere since it usually contains extra [sweeteners](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13197-011-0571-1), so if you will not personally see it coming from a coconut, check the label. Coffee One of the major benefits that a regular cup of [coffee](https://www.rd.com/article/reason-coffee-called-cup-of-joe/) may give you is the feeling of getting energized. With caffeine as its main nutrient, it may as well burn your fats too and improve your performance at work. Furthermore, there are some studies conducted that found out coffee can lessen your chance of developing several diseases and ailments, including Parkinson's and type 2 diabetes. Tea A variety of [teas](https://www.artfultea.com/tea-wisdom-1/best-teas-for-energy) may help to strengthen your immune system, reduce inflammation, and possibly prevent cancer and cardiovascular disease. While certain teas are more beneficial to your health than others, there is a growing body of evidence that drinking tea daily may positively influence your overall [health](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/best-teas-your-health/). How Can I Get Energy Fast Naturally? Getting a quick jolt of energy is not that easy as it would normally take time, but here are some ways you can try to get energy naturally. |WAYS TO GET ENERGY||Benefits| |Take a |[Sleep researchers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10210616/)found out that 10-20 minutes of quick naps in the middle of the day replenishes energy and doesn't disrupt your chances of getting a decent night's sleep. [caffeinated](https://www.caffeineinformer.com/quite-possibly-the-most-powerful-energy-drink-ever)beverages. [crash](https://reizeclub.com/caffeine-crash/)mode and makes it hard for you to focus. One cup of coffee is adequate. Several studies have revealed that a single cup of coffee is sufficient to keep tired [drivers](https://reizeclub.com/best-energy-drinks-driving/)awake on long drives and makes them more attentive behind the wheel. [no added sugar](https://reizeclub.com/best-sugar-free-energy-drinks/) [studies](https://news.sanfordhealth.org/healthy-living/sugar-crash-effects/), sugar-filled energy drinks might cause fainting as quickly as one hour after drinking them. What's the Safest Energy Drink? According to the [American Beverage Association](https://www.americanbeverage.org/), \"caffeine is caffeine\". It makes no difference where you get your caffeine, what matters more is how much of it you consume Plus, they have included that energy drinks are safe to consume if taken in moderate amounts. Furthermore, our health and lifestyles vary, so the [healthiest](https://reizeclub.com/healthiest-energy-drink/) energy drink for you may not be the safest for someone else. Meaning, sugar-free energy drinks are recommended for those with [diabetes](https://reizeclub.com/best-energy-drink-diabetics/), while low caffeinated or non-caffeinated energy drinks are recommended for those with caffeine intolerance, and [calorie-free](https://reizeclub.com/best-zero-calorie-energy-drinks/) energy drinks are recommended for those who follow a diet plan that is strict with their calorie intake, as they are the safest option. Therefore, the safest or the healthiest energy drink for you is the one most appropriate to you, so you should observe how your body reacts to the energy drinks you consume. Best Natural Energy Drinks Knowing that the best drink depends on the individual, here are a few brands that I believe are suitable for a wide range of people. Try them all out, who knows maybe you'll find your best natural energy drink here. MatchaBar Hustle Matcha Energy Matcha Bar Hustle has no added sugar, no artificial ingredients, and no preservatives. Hustle is the first organic energy drink, with [matcha](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/7-benefits-of-matcha-tea) as its primary ingredient. It has a delicious spiked matcha taste that's perfectly balanced with natural mint flavors and just a touch of sweetness. The formulation of Hustle contains natural caffeine, [l-theanine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301051107001573), and other antioxidants, which can provide you sufficient energy without leaving a crash or jitters afterward. Also, it's [vegan](https://reizeclub.com/best-energy-drink-for-vegans/), paleo, and keto-friendly. Monster Energy Zero Ultra You may have probably tried [Monster Energy](https://reizeclub.com/monster-energy-drink-caffeine-ingredients/) before like most of the people in the world, but you may also be one of those people who think it's too sweet. If this is you, you may want to try Monster Energy Zero Ultra. The Monster we all know is filled with sugar and heavy on the syrup, but the Zero Ultra variant, as you might have guessed, contains [zero sugar](https://reizeclub.com/best-energy-drinks-zero-sugar/) and just five calories, creating a combination that's more like sipping carbonated water than consuming a can of cola. This variant of Monster energy drink also comes in a little bit lower [caffeine](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-is-caffeine) having just 140 mg per serving. Other notable mentions: REIZE (Highly-Recommended) Are you looking for a clean and gentle energy drink? Look no further since REIZE is here! I highly recommended that you try REIZE energy drink if you want to drink something that gives natural [energy](https://reizeclub.com/the-best-organic-energy-drinks/) and is delicious at the same time. It comes with the ideal kick, or boost if you may, while also providing you with an adequate supply of vitamins and minerals. Other than that, REIZE is a powdered energy drink that has 50mg of caffeine, 11 calories, and no sugar. You can mix it with any other beverage of your choice since it's compatible with almost any drink, but for me, I like it in cold water. It also contains taurine, ginseng extract, and a significant quantity of B-vitamins, among other things. You can get REIZE for only around $1 per sachet, and you can even have your orders delivered straight to your door. That's amazing value for your money. Don't hesitate to [give REIZE a go today](https://reizeclub.com/get-started/) and see what it has to offer. Is It Good to Take One Energy Drink a Day? As per [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much#:~:text=For%20healthy%20adults%2C%20the%20FDA,it%20(break%20it%20down).), having 400 mg of caffeine a day is relatively safe for some individuals. Adults in good health who wish to use energy drinks shouldn't consume more than one can each day. It's because energy drinks have components that can result in an [overdose](https://reizeclub.com/caffeine-overdose-energy-drinks/) if consumed in a single sitting. Alternatives to these Energy Drinks There could be a lot of alternatives, but the most natural drink that I could recommend is no other than [water](http://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/WaterUNM.html). This purely natural drink that God provided for us is enough to give us the energy we need for the day. In part, this is because dehydration impairs oxygen delivery to the mind and forces your muscles to work to circulate oxygen to all of your physical organs, causing you to become warier and less attentive as a result. You will remain energetic if you keep yourself [hydrated](https://reizeclub.com/best-energy-drinks-for-hydration/). Final Thoughts Your time is valuable and sometimes consuming energy drinks saves you more time because you can be more effective and efficient in a shorter amount of time. Just make sure to not abuse their benefits and always drink in moderation. You may try one or all of the natural energy drinks I suggested above, or check out REIZE, which is my favorite energy drink, to have more incredible energy and stamina to tackle your to-do list and accomplish the things you like doing most. More energy, fantastic health [benefits](https://reizeclub.com/benefits-drinking-energy-drinks/), and no unpleasant caffeine-induced side effects sound like a winning combination, isn't it?
