Hayley de Angelis, from [Melbourne](/news/melbourne/index.html), stumbled upon the idea of spirituality and alternative healing remedies at the age of 24 when she was at a low point in her life. She soon realised how much power and strength she drew from reading self-help books and carrying specific crystals around in her pocket, and how useful they could be for other people too.

The entrepreneur behind a million-dollar crystal empire has revealed the five-minute mental health check she follows every day for success (Hayley de Angelis pictured) There are five things Hayley asks herself every day (pictured) in order to have a quick five-minute mental health check in However, there are still five things she does or checks in with every day in order to help success. 'This is my five-minute mental health check,' Hayley posted on When she performs it - ideally every day - she asks herself five different questions, the first of which is 'have I been nice to myself and others recently?' Hayley explained that in the hustle and bustle of life, we can often forget to take care of both ourselves and the people around us who we love. By asking this question, we force ourselves to consciously check in with what we have done on a personal basis to help our own lives and others'. Hayley de Angelis, from Melbourne, stumbled upon the idea of spirituality and alternative healing remedies at the age of 24 when she was at a low point in her life (her crystals pictured) The five-minute mental health check to do every day Ask yourself these five questions: 1. Have I been nice to myself and others recently? 2. Have I had a good sleep routine? 3. How am I truly feeling? 4. Have I moved my body today? 5. What can I do better? Source: [Cleanse and Co ](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTV5I21PTyP/) Hayley (pictured) said it's good to focus on your sleep and whether you've moved your body on any given day After this, Hayley said she asks herself 'Have I had a good sleep routine?' While you might not think it, sleep has an effect on almost everything we do the next day, and if you're not religiously clocking somewhere between seven and eight hours a night, you can expect to feel run down and irritable the next day. The third question to ask of yourself is: 'How am I truly feeling?' Taking the time to think about whether you are actually tired or just grumpy can help you to channel an emotion and move through it. Then, ask yourself whether you've moved your body that particular day - as movement always helps to flood the body with endorphins. Finally, Hayley asks herself 'What can I do better?' and it can help to write down your answer here. The 28-year-old now sources everything from rose quartz to jade and howlite from countries including China, Brazil, Africa and Madagascar (her products pictured) Hundreds who saw her post thanked the entrepreneur for sharing her advice, and said 'this is so important, thank you'.

Demand for Cleanse and Co's products (pictured) grew quickly, and the business is now a multi-million-dollar success story Hayley began her [Cleanse and Co](https://www.cleanseandco.com.au/) business several years ago, and the 28-year-old now sources everything from rose quartz to jade and howlite from countries including China, Brazil, Africa and Madagascar. 'I started my business by supplying my crystals to a nearby store and working out of the lounge room,' she previously told FEMAIL. 'I would finish my full-time job and be packing orders until midnight most nights. 'By the time I'd finish, my apartment in South Melbourne would look like a bombsite.' Demand for Cleanse & Co's unique items grew quickly, and Hayley soon moved into packing orders from her garage. 'We grew very quickly,' the 28-year-old said. It wasn't long before there was enough demand to launch a website, and Hayley now employs an impressive 20 people. 'It's only recently that I've taken a moment to sit back and see the size of the business,' Hayley said. 'It's always been so much fun for me buying and selling crystals and making candles, so the finances and status of the business were never much of a thought in the early days.' However, since launching, Cleanse and Co has become a multi-million-dollar success story, selling millions of dollars worth of crystals each year. On Cleanse & Co's website, shoppers can find everything from crystal-soaked bath washes to infused candles, crystal towers and mini 'healing kits' (Hayley de Angelis pictured) On Cleanse & Co's website, shoppers can find everything from crystal-soaked bath washes to infused candles, crystal towers and mini 'healing kits'. 'The most popular items are the crystal infused candles,' Hayley said, admitting they sell 200 plus per day. The candles cost $59 each and feature everything from orange calcite for power to amazonite for balance. 'If you're looking to get into crystals, there are three stones which are great starts,' Hayley said. 'The first is rose quartz, as everyone needs love and self love in their life and who doesn't need a pink rock?' The second stone is a clear quartz, which gives you 'cleansing energy and can be styled well in a home'. 'The third stone everyone needs is howlite, which is fantastic for stress and anxiety,' Hayley said. 'It's like carrying around a little safety blanket in your pocket!'
