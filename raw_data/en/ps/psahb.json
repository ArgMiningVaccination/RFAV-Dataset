Most energy drinks are not healthy \u2014 we've known this for a while now. Drinking Red Bull, Monster, or Rockstar comes with health risks. High sugar content, paired with increased amounts of caffeine, are the primary reasons you've been told to stay away from them (via [Rethink Sugary Drink](https://www.rethinksugarydrink.org.au/media/energy-drinks-hide-up-to-21-teaspoons-sugar.html)). There are about [27 grams](https://www.redbull.com/us-en/energydrink/red-bull-energy-drink-ingredients-list) of sugar per 8.4-ounce can of Red Bull, [54 grams](https://beastlyenergy.com/monster-energy-drink-nutrition-facts/) per 16-ounce can of Monster, and [63 grams](https://www.weismarkets.com/shop/product/rockstar-energy-drink-original/154432) per 16-ounce can of RockStar. That's all higher than the average daily recommended sugar intake for adults. According to the [American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/how-much-sugar-is-too-much), men should only ingest at most 36 grams per day, while women should have 25 grams at most. Even in sugar-free products, the caffeine content of these energy drinks can be dangerously high. In Monster and [Rockstar](https://www.nutritionix.com/food/rockstar-energy-drink), there are around 160 milligrams of caffeine per can, which is nearly the [amount of two cups of coffee](https://www.tastingtable.com/695513/espresso-more-caffeine-coffee/) (via [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-caffeine-in-coffee)). Studies have linked the repeated consumption of this amount of caffeine \u2014 in addition to the other weird ingredients tossed into these drinks \u2014 to increased blood pressure and heart problems, reports [NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/energy-drinks-worse-your-heart-caffeine-alone-study-n751686). Less serious (but just as unenjoyable) side effects from frequently enjoying energy drinks can also occur, like headaches, trouble sleeping, digestion issues, dizziness, and anxiety, reports [Caffeine Informer](https://www.caffeineinformer.com/energy-drink-side-effects). Today, there are newer and better options on the market that have less sugar, caffeine, and calories, and even beneficial vitamins or minerals. Read on to learn about healthy energy drinks that you can find in any grocery store. Celsius Celsius, or Celsius Live Fit in particular, is one of the easiest drinks to find in stores. This energy drink is known for its claim of being a workout aid. It aims to increase energy as well as metabolism before workouts (via [Celsius](https://www.celsius.com/frequently-asked-questions/)). The company says that this so-called \"dietary supplement\" may help you burn additional body fat while working out. [Celsius](https://www.celsius.com/frequently-asked-questions/) explains this can happen when the metabolic rate is increased by the inclusion of a blend of green tea, caffeine, ginger root extract, taurine, and guarana. These last two ingredients are energy drink staples. Every can of Celsius is sugar-free, gluten-free, vegan, non-GMO, and Kosher, per the [drink maker](https://www.celsius.com/products/celsius/sparkling-mango-passionfruit/). Harmful ingredients typical to American processed foods, such as high fructose corn syrup, aspartame, and artificial food colorings, are not included. A 12-ounce can of Celsius Original or Celsius Live Fit contains 200 milligrams of caffeine per can, according to [Reize Club](https://reizeclub.com/celsius-energy-drink-nutrition-facts/#How_Much_Caffeine_Is_In_A_Celsius_Live_Fit_Drink). Depending on the type of Celsius, there may be some vitamins and nutrients in each can. [Celsius Peach Vibe](https://www.celsius.com/products/celsius/sparkling-peach-vibe/) contains Vitamins B, C, B6, and B12. You can find this healthy energy drink at Target, CVS, Walmart, and other grocery stores. Zevia Energy [Zevia](https://www.zevia.com/pages/faqs) is an up-and-coming energy drink. You may be more familiar with Zevia Cola \u2014 one of the company's famous zero-calorie and zero-sugar sodas \u2014 or maybe you've heard of Zevia Sparkling Water. However, Zevia Energy (the company's energy drink) also advertises the benefits of these other products, in addition to higher caffeine content per serving. Each 12-ounce can of Zevia Cola contains 45 milligrams of caffeine, while the same size can of Zevia Energy contains 120 milligrams of caffeine. As for additional health benefits, the company claims their product is non-GMO certified. Don't worry about finding artificial sweeteners in this drink either, because there aren't any. Zevia is known for utilizing the [stevia plant](https://www.zevia.com/pages/all-about-stevia) in their products. This natural sweetener is 100 to 300 times as sweet as sugar, meaning you can still expect a very sweet drink (via [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/what-is-stevia)). According to Zevia, the stevia leaf extract is also useful because it's free from calories and won't raise its consumer's blood sugar. You can find Zevia Energy at Kroeger, Target, Sam's Club, Walmart, and other grocery stores. Guayaki Yerba Mate [Guayaki Yerba Mate](https://guayaki.com/our-product-family/) comes in that recognizable yellow packaging. If you've tried yerba mate before, there's a pretty good chance you've had this brand. If you're not familiar with yerba mate at all, here is a brief introduction: Yerba mate is a powerful caffeinated herbal tea that comes from the leaves of the Ilex paraguariensis plant (via [The Spruce](https://www.thespruce.com/yerba-mate-plant-profile-5071184)). It's celebrated for creating fewer jitters and less of a crash than regular tea, explains nutrition myth buster [Jonny Bowden](https://jonnybowden.com/blog/yerba-mate/). The Guayaki Yerba Mate company has many products to choose from, including what they've deemed to be high energy cans. As the brand explains on their website, these 15.5-ounce beverages are a non-carbonated mix of yerba mate and organic fruit juice that offer consumers 150 milligrams of caffeine. They're available at stores, including Target and Walmart, and are available in flavors, including Enlighten Mint, Tropical Uprising, Lemon Elation, Orange Exuberance, and Revel Berry. Bai Bubbles Bai doesn't just offer waters, teas, and other beverages. The company also has an energy drink on the market called Bai Bubbles. Each 11.5-ounce can of Bai Bubbles is gluten-free and kosher. One serving contains only 5 calories and 1 gram of sugar. Some flavors come with additional benefits, like Potassium and Vitamin C. However, all of these drinks are carbonated, so avoid this option if bubbles aren't something you want in your energy drink. Bai Bubbles is less caffeinated compared to other items on this list. There are only 45 milligrams of caffeine in each can of this product, making the dosage closer to the amount of [caffeine found in green tea](https://www.tastingtable.com/693238/caffeine-tea-black-green-white/), rather than a cup of coffee. If this smaller boost of energy is what you're looking for, you shouldn't have trouble finding it. Bai Bubbles is available at Target, Costco, BJ's, Walmart, and other stores. Steaz Yerba Mate Steaz Energy is another line of lesser-known energy drinks owned by a company with several other, more recognizable products. However, when it comes to the brand's energy drinks, they get their energy from yerba mate, green tea, and guarana (via [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Steaz-Energy-Drink-Berry-Pack/dp/B001SB4AB0?tag=tastingtablecom-20)). Each 12-ounce can of Steaz Energy, which comes in flavors like Berry, Orange Clementine, and Super Fruit, contains 100 milligrams of caffeine, meaning you don't get quite as much of a buzz as you would with other options. According to [Giant](https://giantfood.com/groceries/beverages/energy-drinks/steaz-energy-drink-berry-organic-12-oz-can.html), in addition to caffeine, 140 calories, 35 grams of sugar, 55 milligrams of sodium, and 35 grams of carbohydrates can be found in the Berry option of this beverage. But, if you are trying to avoid calories, try Berry Zero. This option has zero calories while still offering the same amount of caffeine in each can. You can find this drink at Giant, Walmart, and Safeway. CLEAN Cause Yerba Mate [CLEAN Cause](https://cleancause.com/collections/drink-clean-cause) is an easy-to-find, relatively healthy energy drink that gathers its caffeine from yerba mate tea. With their low calorie options, you'll find 60 calories per 16-ounce can. But you can avoid calories completely by purchasing from the company's zero calorie line, which has 9 grams of sugar alcohol in each 16-ounce serving. No matter which of their products interests you the most, there's another reason to try this drink. [CLEAN Cause](https://cleancause.com/pages/the-cause) donates 50% of all profits to addiction recovery. Per the drink brand, the company gives back by creating \"sober living scholarships\" that help to support individuals in recovery from drug and alcohol addiction. They've created nearly 3,000 scholarships of this kind \u2014 with almost $1.5 million in donations \u2014 and have grasped the attention of musician Macklemore, who has been open in recent years about his own struggles with addiction. CLEAN Cause energy drinks are also widely available. They can be found at Walmart, Safeway, and other stores. Rebbl Maca Cold-Brew Coffee This next drink is a bit untraditional as far as energy drinks. That's because it is made from coffee. What makes the Rebbl Maca Cold-Brew Coffee even more unique is maca. Maca is a trendy wellness powerhouse that hits many of the health-focused communities' interests, explains [Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heck-maca-4-things-know-204101308.html). There's evidence of the maca root's use in ancient Andean medicines utilized by the Incas (via [Gastro Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/maca-peru-root)). It's also an adaptogenic food, says [Gaia Herbs](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/why-we-love-maca-top-benefits-of-this-amazing-adaptogenic-herb), which is described by [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/stress/smart-girls-guide-to-adaptogens#TOC_TITLE_HDR_1) as a type of food that helps people adjust more effectively to stress. The Rebbl Maca Cold-Brew Coffee has plenty of other advantages. There are 145 milligrams of caffeine per bottle. It is dairy-free, gluten-free, vegan, and USDA Certified Organic. If you're looking to avoid calories altogether, this isn't the drink for you. There are 130 calories per bottle. But on the positive side of things, this could make the drink more filling than other energy drinks. Guru Organic Energy [Guru Organic Energy](https://www.guruenergy.com/en-us/products) is another healthy energy drink. There are only 20 calories and 3 grams of sugar per can of Guru Organic Energy Lite. Each 8.4-ounce can has 100 milligrams of caffeine, which is produced from green tea and guarana. As for the non-lite version of the drink, that has the same amount of caffeine but with 80 calories and 21 grams of sugar. Guarana is a popular energy drink ingredient (per [Web MD](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-935/guarana)) that appears in several drinks on this list and has a higher concentration of caffeine than coffee beans. Per [MIC](https://www.mic.com/life/what-is-guarana-does-it-really-work-better-than-coffee-29697174), \"A coffee bean contains about 2% caffeine by weight, but a guarana bean contains more like 4-6%.\" Guarana contains other stimulants as well, such as theophylline and theobromine. Guru Organic Energy comes in three options: Original, Yerba Mate, and Matcha. However, the Lite version only comes in Original. The Guru brand is available at Walmart. Hiball Just like the cocktail of the same name, [Hiball](https://hiball.com/) combines several different stimulating ingredients to create one powerful drink. In just one can, there are 160 milligrams of caffeine, plus 50 milligrams of guarana, and 50 milligrams of ginseng. In addition to the caffeine of the first two components, ginseng is also believed to boost energy levels (via [Simply Supplements](https://www.simplysupplements.co.uk/healthylife/lack-of-energy/the-fatigue-fighting-benefits-of-ginseng)). You can see why Hiball would want this ingredient in their energy drinks. Each can of Hiball has zero calories, zero sugar, and zero carbs. And, with the main ingredient being carbonated water, this drink might taste a little more like a can of seltzer than a sugary Red Bull. One reviewer compared this drink to such, saying, \"In a nutshell, these taste EXACTLY like any other brand of flavored mineral water such as Crystal Geyser, Perrier, Calistoga, etc\" (via [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SZFTOGEQN76Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CE4CRG0#R1SZFTOGEQN76Z&tag=tastingtablecom-20)). Hiball also infuses its drinks with beneficial vitamins and minerals. You'll get 150% of the daily recommended dose of Vitamin B6 and Vitamin B12 by drinking just one 16-ounce can. RUNA [RUNA](https://runa.com/) is another energy drink that prides itself on having achieved certain health standards. This company has USDA Organic, Fair Trade, Non-GMO, Gluten-Free, and Kosher certifications. RUNA is also a certified \"B Corporation,\" which means it has achieved recognition for having certain social and environmental standards as a business, according to the award's [website](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/certification/). [Guayusa](https://runa.com/our-story/) is the ingredient that makes RUNA unique. Like yerba mate, ginseng, and guarana, guayusa is a plant that is now utilized by drink companies for its energizing properties (via [Very Well Health](https://www.verywellhealth.com/guayusa-benefits-of-caffeine-rich-tea-4103191)). Guayusa is a tree native to the Amazon. The leaves of the tree are harvested and sometimes brewed to produce a tea that has a similar amount of caffeine to a cup of coffee. RUNA claims that the founders, two former Ivy League students at Brown University, founded the company after a trip to the rainforests of Ecuador that introduced them to this powerful plant. RUNA's nutritional information can vary from product to product. For the Berry Boost drink, each 12-ounce can contains 10 calories, 10 milligrams of sodium, 2 grams of sugar, and 3 grams of carbohydrates. There are also 150 milligrams of caffeine and 25% of your daily recommended dose of Vitamin C. You can find this drink at Target, Safeway, and Walmart. Yachak [Yachak](https://www.yachak.com/products/) is an energy drink made from yerba mate. The company has one product line, but this drink comes in different flavors: Blackberry, Passionfruit, Ultimate Mint, Berry Red, and Berry Blue. Every 15.5-ounce can contains 165 milligrams of caffeine. That makes it one of the most caffeinated energy drinks on this list. The company also has roots in the rainforest. Yerba mate, which is the key ingredient in Yachak and other energy drinks, is grown all over the Amazon. The South American country of Brazil \u2014 which is home to 60% of the rainforest (per [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/place/Amazon-Rainforest)) \u2014 is one of the largest producers of Yerba Mate in the world, according to [Statista.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/958875/yerba-mate-planted-area-latin-america/) To give back to the place that provides them with this product, Yachak partners with the One Tree Planted project. Per [Yachak](https://www.yachak.com/our-purpose/), the partnership has a goal of planting over 500,000 trees over 300 acres by 2024. Each can of Yachak contains 150 calories and 34 grams of sugar (aside from Berry Red, which has 33 grams of sugar). Now that may seem like a lot of sugar, but it is \"organic cane sugar\" that is Fair Trade certified, Non-GMO verified, and USDA organic certified. You can find Yachak at Walmart and Sam's Club. ZOA Dwayne \"the Rock\" Johnson is one of the founders of the drink company [Zoa Energy](https://zoaenergy.com/pages/our-story). He's certainly not the only celebrity to launch a product of this kind. Musician 50 Cent also has his own energy drink company called Street King (via [TheRichest](https://www.therichest.com/rich-powerful/celebrities-energy-drinks/)). Johnson launched the Zoa company recently, in 2021, with business partners including John Shulman, who's previously worked with the Voss drink company, reports [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/douglasyu/2021/01/11/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-announces-launch-of-zoa-energy-drinks/?sh=35a06257466b). Johnson is not only a highly paid actor \u2014 and highly followed [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/douglasyu/2021/01/11/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-announces-launch-of-zoa-energy-drinks/?sh=35a06257466b)). Zoa is even marketed as a workout enhancer that will give you warrior strength. The company claims that's because the drink is fueled by amino acids, which help to \"supercharge muscle growth.\" Zoa offers both zero sugar options and 100 calorie options. By choosing the zero sugar option, you'll probably be getting a healthier product of the two. There are still 15 calories per can and nearly 10% of the daily recommended sodium intake for adults. However, there's more of a variety of supplements included in this drink. You can find this drink at Walmart, GNC, and The Vitamin Shoppe. EBOOST Super Fuel [EBOOST Super Fuel](https://www.eboost.com/pages/story) is a sparkling water energy drink. Like the Zoe marketing for warrior customers, EBOOST sells itself as an energy drink for a specific kind of busy person. The website claims, \"EBOOST is for people who live to do more every day \u2014 who thrive on the go and always have a new goal on the horizon.\" The back of the can even provides a list of scenarios when this type of person might need an EBOOST beverage. These situations include work/study, afternoon spark, pre-workout, travel/jet lag, and healthy mixer. In addition to their shameless advertisements towards young working professionals and partygoers, you can tell a little more about their desired audience by their certifications. EBOOST cans are non-GMO, gluten-free, and soy-free, and have 110 milligrams of caffeine per 11.5-ounce can, 10 or 15 calories, depending on the flavor, and a lot of vitamins and minerals. You can find EBOOST at grocery stores such as Target, The Vitamin Shoppe, and Walmart. Matcha LOVE Matcha LOVE is one of several products from [ITO EN](https://itoen.com/), a Japanese company with a variety of green tea products. You may have come across their unsweetened green tea bottles at grocery stores before. They also have an energy drink, Matcha LOVE, which is available in a small white and green can. The unsweetened version of the [Matcha LOVE](https://itoen.com/collections/matcha-love) drink comes in a can that's 5.2 ounces and has about 28 milligrams of caffeine. You can get just slightly more caffeine in the sweetened version of the same size, which contains around 29 milligrams. Matcha LOVE's beneficial properties can vary depending on the quality of the tea. ITO EN claims the matcha used in these drinks is premium and imported from Japan. They also say that Matcha LOVE \"contains approximately [six] times more Catechin Tea Antioxidants than the average ready-to-drink green tea,\" citing the USDA Database for the Flavonoid Content of Selected Foods. This beverage is available at Walmart, Publix, and Wegmans. MatchaBar energy drink that is available at [Whole Foods](https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/product/matchabar-sugar-free-hustle-matcha-energy-drink-12-fl-oz-b07fypwpz5) but completely sold out on their brand's official website. There are only 5 calories per can and about 4% of the daily recommended dose of fiber. This product is also dairy-free, kosher, paleo-friendly, vegan, vegetarian, and keto-friendly, along with other certifications boasted by the brand. There are 120 milligrams of caffeine per 12-ounce can, which is fairly standard for a healthy energy drink option (via [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/MatchaBar-Hustle-Sparkling-Matcha-Energy/dp/B08X18GQS5?tag=tastingtablecom-20)). Ceremonial grade matcha is a key to this drink's selling point. According to [Artful Tea](https://www.artfultea.com/tea-wisdom-1/ceremonial-vs-culinary-grade-matcha-whats-the-difference), this means that the matcha you're getting is better quality than \"culinary grade matcha.\" The name comes from the fact that ceremonial grade matcha is made to be used in a traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Also, this matcha grade is meant to be enjoyed alone, rather than mixed into milk drinks like matcha lattes. neuroSONIC NeuroSONIC can be purchased on Amazon or at Walmart. It is one of many drinks [Neuro](https://drinkneuro.com/). Each drink is made to help the user with a specific area of their lifestyle. The neuroSONIC drink claims that consumers with have their \"energy refreshed \"upon sipping. Their website also advertises drinks like neuroSLEEP for better rest and neuroBLISS for reduced stress. The company's neuroSONIC drink contains 35 calories per serving. In this case, that serving size is one 14.5 ounce bottle. There are 9 grams of sugar in each drink. However, you can get the entire recommended daily dose of Vitamins D, B6, and B12 from drinking just one of these bottles. With neuroSONIC and many other energy drinks, you're likely to be met with the ingredient L-Theanine. This nutrient is the most common form of Theanine, which is an amino acid, according to [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1053/theanine). L-Theanine is primarily added to focus and energy-enhancing drinks because it is believed to improve brain function, explains [Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324120). Other possible benefits include anxiety and stress relief, immunity, and blood pressure regulation. Alani Nu Energy Alani Nu is a wellness and fitness brand that peddles an assortment of products including an energy drink line. Alani Nu Energy is one of many newer, healthier energy drinks disrupting the industry. There are 15 or fewer calories and 0 grams of sugar per 12-oune can of Alani Nu Energy, which is available in a dozen flavors including Hawaiian Shaved Ice and Watermelon Wave. Not only is the drink low in the bad stuff, it's high in the good stuff, such as health-boosting vitamins like B6 and B12 and minerals like potassium. As for the energy portion of the drink, there are 200 milligrams of caffeine in each can, which is the equivalent to drinking about two cups of coffee (via [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-caffeine-in-coffee)). Alani Nu Energy is available at grocery stores like Target, Walmart, and Kroger. Since those chains alone have so many locations throughout the country, finding this drink shouldn't be too hard. Sambazon Low Calorie Amazon Energy Sambazon is a company built around the power of a\u00e7a\u00ed, those purple-colored berries commonly found in smoothie bowls. The brand's name takes inspiration from the Amazon rainforest, where these famous berries grow on a\u00e7a\u00ed palm trees. As [Good Housekeeping](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a47009/what-is-acai/) explains, the health hype comes from the fact that the berries are full of calcium, fiber, healthy fats, and antioxidants. Per [Sambazon](https://www.sambazon.com/products/original-acai-energy-drink), the caffeine comes from multiple sources, including yerba mate, green tea, and guarana. Combined, this amounts to 120 milligrams of caffeine per 12-ounce can (via [Caffeine Informer](https://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/amazon-energy-drink)). Since the nutritional stats for the standard version is a mixed bag, we suggest sticking with the [Low Calorie Sambazon Amazon Energy Drink](https://www.sambazon.com/products/low-calorie-acai-energy-drink) with 35 calories, 17 grams of carbohydrates, and six grams of sugar in each can. You'll also receive 310% of your daily serving of vitamin C. Of course, each drink is also made with a\u00e7a\u00ed juice, so it's suggested that you'll also enjoy the benefits of those berries as well. FocusAid FocusAid is an energy drink from the [LifeAid](https://www.lifeaidbevco.com/blends) beverage company. It is one of several such products that are functional beverages made to help with different health concerns, such as FitAid for workout recovery, ImmunityAid for preventing sickness, PartyAid for hangovers, and LifeAid Hemp for feeling calm. But FocusAid, which is available in Watermelon Mint and Melon Mate flavors, is its functional beverage aimed at improving both mental and physical energy. The [ brand](https://www.lifeaidbevco.com/focusaid-wm-case) claims that drinking FocusAid will boost your energy through its blend of nootropics, B vitamins, and caffeine. Each can contains 100 milligrams of caffeine via a combo of green tea extract and yerba mate. The addition of B-complex vitamins can help fuel several of the body's different biological processes (via [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-b-complex)). The drink also contains acetyl-L-carnitine, gaba, and alpha-GPC. These three components are sometimes used as nootropics supplements for the improvement of brain function, [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-nootropic-brain-supplements) explains. A 12-ounce can of FocusAid will set you back 40 calories and 7 grams of sugar. You can also opt for [FocusAid Zero](https://www.lifeaidbevco.com/focusaid-zero-case), which only contains 5 calories and zero grams of sugar per can. You can buy FocusAid at grocery stores such as Whole Foods, Walmart, and Safeway. C4 Energy Fitness megabrand C4 offers a wide variety of beverage options, but its flagship [C4 Energy](https://c4energy.com/products/c4-energy-carbonated) is the company's best seller. Available in fun flavors such as Cotton Candy and Frozen Bombsicle, it contains zero calories, zero grams of sugar, and zero carbohydrates. Even better, it's packed with 190% of the daily recommended dose of niacin, a B vitamin that helps you convert food into energy (via [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-niacin/art-20364984)), and 250% of the daily recommended dose of vitamin B12, which is beneficial for various bodily functions (via [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-vitamin-b12)). To top it all off, C4 Energy contains 200 milligrams of caffeine per 16-ounce can. As a carbonated beverage, drinking C4 Energy could come with some negative side effects \u2014 ones that wouldn't occur with non-carbonated energy drinks \u2014 such as teeth erosion, loss of bone density, or increased acid reflux (via [Eat This, Not That](https://www.eatthis.com/news-side-effects-carbonated-beverages-science/)). But in moderation, this could be the healthy energy drink that's right for you. Aspire If you're looking for an energy drink that contains zero calories, sugars, and carbohydrates, consider Aspire. According to the brand, these drinks offer multiple health benefits, including ones that aren't provided by more generic energy drinks. These beverages contain naturally occurring caffeine (provided by guarana and green tea), meant to prevent crashing. There's calorie burning boosts, also provided by components in green tea and guarana. Aspire is even diabetes-friendly, as the beverages are sweetened with sucralose, which doesn't affect blood sugar levels. You'll be treated to 70% of the daily dose of niacin, vitamin C, and vitamin B12, plus 200% of your B6 serving in each 12-ounce can. Also, there's exposure to calcium, biotin, and even more nutrients, in smaller amounts. And it doesn't even end there. All flavors are vegan, kosher, gluten-free, soy-free, and non-GMO. You can find these healthy energy drinks at Walmart, Sam's Club, or Rite Aid. OCA [OCA is relatively new to the beverage scene, but it's already making big waves with it's carbonated, plant-based energy drinks. Brands in this space tend to highlight a specific ingredient to set themselves apart from the competition, and OCA is no exception, focusing on the addition of tapioca. You may have come across tapioca in pudding or the chewy bubbles at the bottom of your boba tea, but in its original form, it is a complex carbohydrate found in the cassava root plant (via ](https://www.drinkoca.com/) [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/tapioca#TOC_TITLE_HDR_6)). [OCA](https://www.drinkoca.com/) claims that tapioca provides a more natural source of energy, compared to other drinks. Instead of creating a burst of energy followed by a crash, OCA is hoping that its tapioca-powered beverages give you long-lasting, steady power. There are 120 milligrams of natural caffeine (courtesy of the cassava root extract) in every can. OCA is available in [four flavors](https://www.drinkoca.com/collections/all-products), with each containing 60 calories, 9 grams of sugar, and 15 milligrams of sodium. The [company](https://www.drinkoca.com/blogs/oca-community/plant-based-energy-drink-oca-expands-nationwide-in-kroger-introduces-a-new-flavor) announced in November 2021 that it partnered with grocery behemoth Kroger, which has over 2,000 locations across the country. OCA is also available at chains such as Albertsons, Randalls, and Grocery Outlet. Heywell [Heywell](https://livingheywell.com/pages/our-ingredients) is a brand focused on adaptogens, which are nutrients that, according to [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/balance/adaptogens-what-to-know), may assist one's body with adapting to daily stressors, whatever they may be. The nutrients used as adaptogens in these drinks include ashwagandha, l-theanine, lemon balm, and alma berry. While its beverage line isn't exclusive to energy drinks, it offers two different options if you're looking for a boost. Heywell's [energy + focus](https://livingheywell.com/products/energy-focus) is a strawberry and lemon-flavored drink that is designed to help you power up. It contains 75 milligrams of caffeine, as well as the adaptogens schisandra (a berry said to help with de-stressing and energy boosts), L-theanine (a compound from green tea that helps with concentration), and ashwagandha (an herb used to target occasional stress), according to Heywell. The caffeine comes from [green coffee beans](https://drinksupercoffee.com/blog/nutrition/green-coffee/), which are essentially unroasted coffee beans known for their health benefits. Each can contains only 10 calories, 1 gram of sugar, and 7 grams of carbohydrates. The [energy + immunity](https://livingheywell.com/products/energy-immunity) drink (which comes in a grapefruit flavor) is similar, with 75 milligrams of caffeine, a handful of adaptogens, and a nutritional label not far from that of the energy + focus drink. You can find Heywell's drinks at Target or other grocery stores. V8 +Energy You may already be familiar with V8, the sweet and savory juice blend that is currently under the [Campbell's](https://www.campbells.com/v8/what-does-v8-stand-for/) umbrella. While the original is made with seven different vegetables (plus tomato), this energy drink spinoff is more fruit focused with flavors such as Orange Pineapple, Strawberry Kiwi, and Black Cherry. Nutritional information for [V8 +Energy](https://www.campbells.com/v8/v8-energy/) will vary. Strawberry-Kiwi contains 50 calories, 60 milligrams of sodium, 12 grams of carbohydrates, and 10 grams of sugar, per 11.5-ounce can. That's not nothing, especially compared to other healthy energy drinks with all zeros on the backs of its cans. But V8 +Energy makes up for that with a plant-powered ingredients list full of foods you'll recognize (and be able to pronounce), along with 80 milligrams of caffeine per serving. Most flavors, including [Lemon Lime](https://www.campbells.com/v8/products/v8-energy/sparkling-lemon-lime/), will also provide some of your daily recommended servings of vitamins. You can find V8 +Energy drinks at Kroger, Target, Walmart, and Safeway. Riot [Riot](https://riot.energy/pages/about-us) launched out of Southern California in 2016 and has been developing its health-focused energy drinks ever since. The brand prides itself on producing sugar-free and fully plant-based beverages \u2014 that doesn't sound half-bad! Currently there is a limited selection of fruit [flavors](https://riot.energy/collections/all): you can choose from Citrus-Lime, Berry, Cherry Watermelon, or Mango. Each 16-ounce can contains 160 milligrams of caffeine. While the nutritional facts vary by flavor you can expect a maximum of 70 calories, 16 grams of carbohydrates and 14 grams of sugar per can. You'll also get 200% of your daily recommended serving of vitamin B12 for the day, 100 milligrams of the amino acid L-theanine, adaptogens, as well as some potassium. Riot Energy is available at chains such as Whole Foods and Ralphs, but if you're looking to purchase a can, we recommend using the brand's [store locator](https://riot.energy/apps/store-locator) to track down which retailers carry it. Reign Reign is another healthy energy drink company focused on fitness. The brand emphasizes it's impressive rosters of [ambassadors](https://reignbodyfuel.com/en-us/ambassadors/) includes World's Strongest Man competition winner Hafthor Bj\u00f6rnsson and MMA superstar Cris Cyborg. But behind this common marketing scheme, Reign offers a powerful drink that contains a lot of caffeine, as well as other ingredients that gym-goers may be seeking for their workout fuel. Cans of Reign, such as the [ Melon Mania](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q2X2CRW?maas=maas_adg_6A7EB9B36F229F4EB1C192B3EC127C43_afap_abs&ref_=aa_maas&tag=tastingtablecom-20) flavor, typically contain around 300 milligrams of caffeine. That caffeine comes from green coffee beans, according to [the company](https://reignbodyfuel.com/en-us/products/melon-mania/). There are also 10 calories, 200 milligrams of sodium, and 3 grams of carbohydrates in each can. Although the amount of sodium may alarm you, Reign makes up for it with the drink's servings of potassium, niacin, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12. But that's not all that [Reign](https://reignbodyfuel.com/en-us/products/carnival-candy/) promises in each can. Others additions include health-boosting nutrients like BCAA's (which help you preserve and fuel muscles), COQ10 (which help with organ function), and electrolytes (which aid in hydration). You can purchase Reign energy drinks at Target, Walmart, and Safeway. "}
