Please consult your healthcare provider with any questions or concerns you may have regarding your condition. As our city re-opens and COVID cases spike, it becomes so important to implement your self-care routine. And if you were vigilant in the beginning but have found that your precautions and wellness practices fell to the wayside, you're not alone- many are experiencing [\"quarantine fatigue\"](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/08/health/quarantine-fatigue-is-real-coronavirus-wellness/index.html). We hope these tips refresh you from the fatigue and offer some guidance for taking care of yourself and your family during this time. The health and wellbeing of our clinic, clients, and community is always our top priority. The need for physical distancing, masks, and hand-washing remains extremely important. Please continue to make safe choices, and contact us if we can be of support in any way ( [we are open for acupuncture and virtual visits!](https://balancecharleston.com/book-now)). Chinese Medicine + Self-Care From a Chinese medical perspective, right now we should act preventatively to strengthen our immune system and activate our qi, eliminate phlegm and mucus, and keep out pathogenic cold (Chinese Medicine defines COVID-19 as a \"damp-cold\" pathogen). The teachings and practices of Chinese Medicine, along with some lifestyle modifications, can help support our immune and respiratory systems. When we stay as balanced as possible, our body is stronger, more resilient, and more capable of handling and healing from whatever comes our way. MOVEMENT IS MEDICINE This is our #1. One of best things we can do right now for our health is to MOVE.Movement keeps the qi flowing- specifically, our LIVER QI. Qi is our vital energy, coursing through our body to support life. It holds the body's innate intelligence, how we maintain \"homeostasis\" and the body's ability to regulate its internal environment to create good health. The smooth flow of qi, which is controlled by the Liver meridian system, ensures optimal functioning of all systems in the body- including the respiratory and circulatory system. Chinese Medicine says the Liver controls our diaphragm. When qi is moving freely, the diaphragm is open and the lung energy descends to the kidneys for effortless inhales and exhales. When there's constraint, qi stagnates in the chest and there may be wheezing, chest tightness, or shortness of breath. Qi moves the blood. Specifically, the movement of Liver qi influences how blood circulates throughout our body. Overtime, liver qi stagnation (due to emotional factors, poor diet, sedentary lifestyle, etc) can lead to blood stagnation, blockages, and circulatory issues. We should focus on the Liver qi for being as healthy as possible for our physical health. Here are things you can do: Gentle exercise and walking. At least 1 hour of gentle walking is recommended, every day of the week. 2 hours is ideal. Walking is one of the best things you can do for your health right now! Drink less alcohol Eat a clean diet (fresh, local, mostly produce, no preservatives, dyes, additives, or pesticides) De-stress with acupuncture Supportive herbal formula: Xiao Yao Wan \"Free and Easy Wanderer\": unblocks the Liver qi and nourishes blood A calm, open heart and a relaxed spirit will also positively impact how Liver qi moves in the body. Here are things you can do: Practice slow, deep breaths Meditation Qi gong or tai chi Gratitude journal Use floral essential oils like jasmine, rose, and magnolia to inspire feelings of safety, beauty, love, and connection. And, of course, physical movement supports us in many ways. When we exercise, our respiratory rate increases which helps to circulate air more fully through our lungs. Movement increases the number of white blood cells, which help fight infections. Neurotransmitters that play a powerful role in mood regulation are also released when we move - which can reduce stress and improve overall feeling of wellbeing. SUPPORT YOUR LUNGS Additionally, there are things we can do to move stagnation in the chest and exercise the lungs. Try breathing exercises, self-massage, stretching, and singing. This can help improve circulation of blood, qi, and oxygen, and promote better lung health and prevent build-up of phlegm and fluid. Herbs we like to support lung health include astragalus (huang qi) and reishi (ling zhi). Both are tonic herbs that strengthen lung qi (our respiratory system) and aid in healing. Astragalus is the main ingredient in the Classical Chinese herbal formula Jade Windscreen, used for protecting one from viral/bacterial infections since the Song Dynasty of China! Reishi, like all medicinal mushrooms, is an immune system powerhouse that has been used a lot recently in cancer therapy, but are also helpful for fighting off antibiotic resistant bacterial strains and common colds. USING ESSENTIAL OILS Remember, COVID-19 is defined as a \"cold damp\" pathogen in Chinese medical terms. This means we need to modify our environment, internally and externally, so that we are not good hosts for the virus. In other words, warm things up! Diffuse essential oils that are \"warming\". These include: pine, spruce, patchouli, and \"kitchen spice\" oils like ginger, clove, basil, and cinnamon. All essential oils have anti-micorbrial and anti-pathogenic properties. Additionally, pine and spruce strengthen the lungs; patchouli transforms dampness; basil boosts ginger cinnamon promotes circulation; and, clove is strongly anti-microbial. You likely already have the germ-fighting staples: lemon, tea tree, eucalyptus, and peppermint. These are also great to diffuse. Just add the warming oils to the rotation! FOOD THERAPY Enjoy a light, clean, nourishing diet. Our goal is to minimize a phlegm-producing diet. Be mindful of your intake of dairy and greasy food (DAMP) and icy drinks, frozen desserts, and raw foods like salads (COLD). If you are to avoid one thing, make it sugar. Sugar weakens the immune system, creates phlegm, and triggers low-grade inflammation. Keep your meals colorful with lots of fruits and veggies so you know you're getting as many vitamins and nutrients as possible. The liver likes lighter meals and fresh greens to keep the qi flowing. Use aromatic spices (thyme, oregano, basil...) to light that digestive fire and counter phlegm or damp accumulation. Introduce lung-supporting, healing foods like congee, bone broth, fire cider, honey, garlic, ginger, shiitakes, and scallions. ADDITIONAL TIPS FOR WELLNESS DURING THIS TIME: Drink clean, filtered water (not from a plastic bottle). Staying hydrated is essential for good health- and lung health, especially. Sleep soundly 7-8 hours/night Consider a daily saline lavage pot) or salt water gargle: Gargling with salt water helps to cleanse your mouth and throat, making the mucosa at the back of your mouth and throat a less desirable place for viruses. Supplements and herbs to help prevent or minimize symptoms for future viral infections (recommended dosage levels are for adults): Vitamin C: 3,000 milligrams (or more) daily, in divided doses. Vitamin D3: 2,000 International Units daily. (Start with 5,000 IU/day for two weeks, then reduce to 2,000) Magnesium: 400 mg daily (in citrate, malate, chelate, or 100 mcg (micrograms) daily Elderberry syrup (there are many brands that are toddler friendly!) When it comes to taking supplements and herbs, we highly recommend speaking with your health care practitioner to establish a plan that is best for you!
