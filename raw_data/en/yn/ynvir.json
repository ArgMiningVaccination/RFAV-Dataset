NooCube Sleep Upgrade Ingredients The Sleep Upgrade formula includes the following ingredients: Lemon balm is a mint family herb with proven calming effects. It helps induce sleep by boosting relaxation and reducing stress, which may work well for people struggling with anxiety-driven sleep problems. A [ 2010 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3230760/) of lemon balm's effects on stress-induced sleep disruption found a 42% decrease in insomnia symptoms. Lavender, a flowering plant in the mint family, is well known for its relaxing effects when inhaled as an essential oil. According to [ research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612440/), taking lavender orally can also improve sleep quality and help you stay asleep longer without dealing with daytime drowsiness the next day. Vitamin D3 deficiency has been linked to sleep disorders. [ Studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32156230/) indicate supplementing this vital vitamin may help treat insomnia by regulating the body's circadian rhythm and encouraging natural melatonin production. Magnesium citrate is a mineral that many people don't consume enough of in their daily diets. This [ 2012 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3703169/) found that magnesium supplements can help you sleep longer and get higher-quality sleep. It may also increase melatonin levels and decrease levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Calcium deficiency has been linked in [ studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3866235/) to insomnia. This ingredient may help you fall asleep faster and achieve more restorative rest.

DreamZzz: All-Natural, Non-Habit Forming Sleep Aid DreamZzz offers another excellent option if you're searching for the best sleep aids made with natural ingredients. This supplement comes from BrickHouse Nutrition, a Texas-based supplement company offering several popular wellness products formulated by physicians using natural ingredients. Military members and first responders benefit from 15% discounts on their DreamZzz orders, which is one of the reasons we included this effective supplement on our list.

Users enjoy restful sleep and wake up feeling ready to tackle the day. DreamZzz Ingredients The DreamZzz formula includes 13 ingredients shown to help consumers get a good night's sleep: Chamomile is popular in tea form for its relaxing and sedative effects. This is regarded by [ researchers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2995283/) as an effective tranquilizer that helps you fall asleep. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an [ inhibitor neurotransmitter](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11983310/), which means it blocks brain signals in the central nervous system. This ingredient may help you fall asleep faster and promote regeneration. L-theanine, an amino acid, helps treat insomnia by [ reducing anxiety](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25759004/) and promoting higher-quality sleep. Hops help people with trouble sleeping by increasing GABA activity, reducing brain activity for better sleep. Lemon balm, also found in Sleep Upgrade, encourages calmness. It may also help improve mood and cognition. Passionflower is a popular sleep aid in South Africa. Its sedative effects improve sleep quality without next-day drowsiness. Research with humans is limited, but one [ study using rodents](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6977488/) shows excellent promise. Jujube is a small, fruit-bearing plant known for many health benefits. As explored in this [ study with mice](http://www.americanbiosciences.com/pdf/Ziziphusstudy.pdf), this ingredient can help lower anxiety and extend sleep time. 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is a compound used in the body as a precursor to the hormone serotonin. Its benefits for people with sleep disorders have been widely researched. In one study described in [ this review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7796270/), REM sleep increased from 5 to 53%. Magnesium bisglycinate consists of melatonin-boosting magnesium and glycine, an amino acid that can boost serotonin levels for anxiety relief. Magnesium may help promote relaxation in the muscles in addition to the benefits explained above. Zinc is a mineral critical to a properly functioning central nervous system. [ Various studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5713303/) have found zinc supplementation beneficial in extending sleep time and improving sleep quality. Vitamin B6 plays a key role in regulating levels of GABA and serotonin in the body. [ Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4772032/) indicates that B6 deficiency can result in trouble sleeping. This vitamin may help regulate serotonin receptor activity and help with serotonin production. Mucuna pruriens, or velvet bean, is a legume that may improve dopamine levels. A [ study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3388003/) using this ingredient and an herb called Chlorophytum borivilianum noted significant sleep improvements after 28 days of taking these herbal supplements. Melatonin is a hormone the brain naturally produces in the dark. The pineal gland, located near the brainstem, releases it to help the body maintain a regular sleep schedule.

Beam Dream: Powerful Sleep Support Supplement With Melatonin If you prefer not to swallow a sleep aid in pill form, you might choose Dream, a genius product that puts the power of natural sleep aids into a yummy before-bed treat. Dream is a vegan, non-GMO hot cocoa mix containing natural ingredients to help you combat sleep issues. Beam, the company behind this product, is a mindful brand offering natural wellness products in powder, capsule, and oil supplement forms.

In the [ six-week study](https://shopbeam.com/pages/clinical-study), Dream was proven effective in helping 93% of participants improve sleep quality. Beam Dream Ingredients The Dream formula contains five primary ingredients to promote sleep: Nano hemp offers the benefits of cannabidiol (CBD) in smaller particles that are [ more easily absorbed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8489317/) by the body. This ingredient may help you relax, improve your mood, and decrease stress and anxiety levels. Reishi is a mushroom hailed as a superfood. Although further research is needed to understand the chemistry of this ingredient, it may help support a healthy sleep-wake cycle and regulate stress. Magnesium, found in both the sleep aids listed above, is a common ingredient in natural sleep medicine. It helps your muscles relax, regulates your central nervous system, and promotes better sleep. L-theanine, also discussed above, helps improve sleep quality by reducing stress and encouraging relaxation. Melatonin, a common ingredient in sleep aids, promotes a good night's sleep by causing drowsiness when your body is exposed to the dark. What We Like Most About Beam Dream Dream offers natural sleep medicine in a delicious package. Consumers choose from five flavors: original hot cocoa, chocolate-covered strawberry, chocolate raspberry, white chocolate peppermint, and sea salt caramel.

Like DreamZzz, Dream allows consumers to buy this product through subscriptions or one-time purchases. This sleep aid costs more than the others on our list at $95 for a 30-day supply, but you can save by subscribing, which brings the price down to $76. Best Natural OTC Sleep Aids Whether you're looking for individual dietary supplements or comprehensive formulas, you have many options for natural over-the-counter (OTC) sleep aids. You can get these supplements without a prescription, but that doesn't always mean they provide safe help with insomnia. You may speak with your doctor before starting any new supplement to ensure it won't interact with other medications you take or aggravate an existing condition. Let's explore the top 10 natural sleep aids you'll find in many popular bedtime supplements, how they can help, and their possible adverse effects: Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine found in many medications, including Benadryl, ZzzQuil, and Tylenol PM. Doctors may recommend it to reduce allergy symptoms or treat allergic reactions, but many consumers who struggle with sleep problems take this medication to treat insomnia and other sleep disorders. If you use OTC sleep aids containing diphenhydramine, keep the following cautions in mind: - Long-term use of common painkiller medications containing diphenhydramine (Tylenol, Advil, or Aleve PM) may pose risks to your liver, kidneys, or heart. - Long-term use of Benadryl has been linked to an increased risk of dementia. - Diphenhydramine can cause side effects, particularly for older adults. These include daytime drowsiness, low blood pressure, headache, confusion, and more. Among natural sleep aids, this option may be okay for occasional use, but medical professionals don't recommend it for long-term insomnia treatment. Another natural supplement may suit you better if you take sleep aids most nights. Doxylamine (Unisom) Doxylamine is an antihistamine commonly used in sleep medication, most notably under the brand name Unisom. This OTC sleep aid can help you with falling asleep and improving sleep quality, but it can also cause morning grogginess. Potential adverse effects of doxylamine include increased fall risks for older adults and extreme drowsiness, particularly when taken with alcohol. Other potential side effects of this sleep aid include the following: - Dry mouth - Drowsiness - Dizziness - Confusion - Headache - Constipation - Blurry vision Like diphenhydramine, the long-term continued use of doxylamine is not recommended. If you must take a sleep aid for longer than two weeks, you may want to look into other options with fewer potential side effects. If you try either of these antihistamine medications for sleep problems, avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until you understand how it affects you. Some consumers take sleep aids like these in the middle of the night, but doctors don't recommend this practice; it's critical to give yourself plenty of time to get a full night's sleep to prevent grogginess the next day. Melatonin Melatonin is one of the most common OTC sleep aids available today. You can find a variety of options at any local grocery store selling vitamins and other pharmacy products. Melatonin supplements increase your body's levels of this natural hormone, encouraging your brain to prepare for sleep. Because your body uses melatonin to regulate its natural sleep cycle, this supplement may work particularly well for consumers trying to sleep at odd hours. If you work at night and sleep during the day or deal with jet lag from frequent traveling, melatonin supplements may help you maintain good sleep hygiene. Many OTC sleep aids contain melatonin, including the Dream and DreamZzz dietary supplements on our list of the best sleep aids. Valerian Root Many natural sleep remedies contain the root of the valerian herb to help treat moderate insomnia, but researchers report varied results. Some [ research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6127017/) suggests taking valerian root can help with sleep latency and quality and reduce anxiety and depression, while [ others](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5263087/) note negligible findings. Potential benefits of valerian root in natural sleep aids include improved sleep quality without morning drowsiness. Consumers who take this sleep aid for a short period experience little to no side effects, but research is limited on its long-term use. Further study is needed to understand precisely how valerian root treats insomnia. Lavender Using lavender essential oils to help with sleep issues has been a widespread practice for hundreds of years. You'll find all kinds of sleep aid products centered around the fragrance of this flowering plant, including oil extracts, pillow sprays, and more. Consider [ this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5376423/), which researched the effects of inhaled essential oils (including lavender) on sleep within a group of older adults with dementia. During a 20-day period, inhaling essential oils helped participants lengthen their sleep times and experience fewer awakenings in the early morning. You'll also find lavender as an ingested ingredient in certain natural sleep aids, such as NooCube's Sleep Upgrade. It may help you improve the quality of your sleep if you wake up often or struggle with restlessness throughout the night. Passionflower Passionflower is a plant used in herbal supplements for hundreds of years. Native peoples in North, Central, and South America relied on it for its soothing effects. Today, you'll find it in many herbal supplements designed to help with sleep problems. Natural remedies like DreamZzz by BrickHouse Nutrition incorporate this ingredient to take advantage of its sedative effects. Researchers seem to agree that further study is needed to fully understand the potential benefits of this plant as a natural sleep aid, but some research shows promising results. For example, participants of a double-blind [ study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21294203/) comparing the effects of passionflower tea versus a placebo reported improved sleep quality when drinking passionflower. Glycine The body uses the amino acid glycine to build important proteins and for chemical signaling in the brain. The scientific community doesn't entirely understand how glycine works, but research suggests it may help with treating insomnia, so many OTC sleep aids include it in their formulas. In a [ 2007 study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1479-8425.2007.00262.x), eleven participants between the ages of 30 and 57 took glycine before bed and experienced several benefits. The study reported better quality sleep, faster sleep onset, less daytime drowsiness, and improved memory without changing participants' normal sleep architecture like some sleep medicine. GABA As we mentioned when discussing DreamZzz, GABA is a neurotransmitter that affects brain cell activity. Several prescription sleep aids promote sleep through the activation of GABA receptors in the brain, slowing brain activity. Sleep aids containing [ GABA](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29856155/) may help you fall asleep more quickly and stay asleep longer, although further study is needed to determine the efficacy of consuming it in a supplement. Some studies suggest that GABA can breach the blood-brain barrier, but other researchers don't agree. Although sleep aids typically contain small doses of GABA not associated with serious side effects, large doses may cause daytime sleepiness. Cannabidiol (CBD) CBD is a cannabinoid compound found in hemp and cannabis plants. You may have heard of another prominent cannabinoid, THC, which causes the psychoactive effects of cannabis, but CBD works differently and does not make consumers feel \"high.\" Research on the impact of CBD supports it as an excellent option for consumers looking for natural sleep aids. Taking CBD may help reduce anxiety and improve your quality of sleep. In a [ 2019 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/30624194/), participants were given CBD capsules in the morning for anxiety or at night for poor sleep. After a month, researchers noted a decrease in anxiety scores in 79.2% of patients and an increase in sleep scores in 66.7%. 5-HTP Many of the best sleep aids contain 5-HTP, a metabolite of L-tryptophan, because it effectively boosts serotonin synthesis. By increasing serotonin levels in the central nervous system, [ 5-HTP](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9727088/) may help you overcome sleep problems, anxiety, depression, and low libido. It may also help you with weight management. You'll find this as an ingredient in all kinds of sleep medicine, often in doses between 50 and 150 milligrams. 5-HTP doesn't cause sleepiness, so some consumers take supplements throughout the day (often at meal times) to help elevate mood and reduce stress. Prescription Sleeping Pills People with severe insomnia may look to their doctors for more powerful sleep aids than they can access over the counter. Ambien, Restoril, and Silenor are three commonly prescribed sleep aids that effectively help with falling and staying asleep. If you want to talk to your doctor about prescription sleep medicine, remember that these medications often come with a long list of potential side effects. Let's review each option more closely, including some possible adverse effects: Ambien Ambien is a prescription sleep medication for short-term relief from insomnia. It's designed to reduce sleep latency but can pose risks from many different side effects. Older adults and specific other populations may need lower than the typical dose to prevent unwanted effects. The potential side effects of Ambien include the following: - Daytime drowsiness - Lightheadedness - Feeling \"drugged\" - Dizziness - Headache - Diarrhea Other, more serious effects can also occur, such as: - Anxiety - Agitation - Aggression - Depression - Confusion - Memory problems - Hallucinations - Abnormal thoughts or behavior - Thoughts of self-harm If you take these prescription sleep aids, contact your doctor with any questions or if you experience any side effects. Restoril Restoril, another prescription sleep medication, helps consumers who have trouble falling asleep and remaining asleep through the night. This sleep medicine is a benzodiazepine, a class of drugs that reduce anxiety and promote relaxation and sedation. Like other prescription sleep aids, doctors don't recommend using Restoril for longer than two weeks. If you take Restoril, you may notice daytime sleepiness or other, more severe possible side effects, such as: - Mood or behavior changes - Memory loss - Depression - Anxiety - Unusual thoughts - Hallucinations - Confusion - Agitation or aggression - Thoughts of suicide If you experience any of these effects, talk to your physician about changing your dose or trying an alternative sleep aid. Silenor Doctors prescribe Silenor to help people stay asleep through the night. Like Ambien and other powerful sleep aids, Silenor is not intended for long-term use, and you should only take it for up to two weeks. Certain people should not take Silenor, such as those with untreated glaucoma, sleep apnea, or who take specific medications. Your doctor can help you understand if you can safely use this sleep medication. The possible side effects of Silenor may include the following: - Confusion - Depression - Lightheadedness - Abnormal thoughts or behavior - Uncontrolled muscle movements - Seizures - Chest pain - Eye pain Some users of Silenor and other prescription sleep aids experience blackouts, during which they drive, make phone calls, and perform other activities they don't remember engaging in. If you experience any of these or other unpleasant symptoms while taking Silenor, call your doctor. Healthcare professionals don't recommend drinking alcohol while taking any prescription sleep aids. Neither should you take more than the recommended dose to avoid adverse effects. Frequently Asked Questions About Natural Sleep Aids What natural sleeping pill is the most effective? The most effective natural sleeping pill depends on the consumer. Unisom and Benadryl are two common options, but other natural sleep supplements may help with sleep problems without the risks of reliance or unpleasant side effects. You may need to try a few OTC sleep aids to determine what works best for you. We recommend NooCube's Sleep Upgrade, BrickHouse Nutrition's DreamZzz, or Beam's Dream hot cocoa mix because these products offer non-habit-forming relief from insomnia and other sleep disorders. Reviewers of these popular sleep supplements often report more effectiveness than other products. Is it okay to take a sleep aid every night? Doctors don't recommend taking certain sleep aids longer than one to two weeks. You should avoid taking prescription sleeping pills and OTC sleep aids containing diphenhydramine or doxylamine for extended periods due to the risks of side effects and becoming reliant on medications. Some experts also warn against taking more than the recommended dose of melatonin every night to prevent affecting your body's natural melatonin production. What else can help me fall asleep at night? [Research](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2021/6068952/) suggests that changing your sleep behaviors may help you sleep more effectively than taking OTC or prescription sleep aids. Keep the following tips in mind to maintain good sleep hygiene: - Avoid alcohol or nicotine around bedtime. - Remove caffeine from your diet. - Limit your consumption of sugary foods. - Maintain a regular sleep schedule. - Avoid napping during the day. - Engage in physical activity every day. - Find effective coping techniques to manage stress. - Do calming activities before bed, like reading. - Avoid screens in the bedroom. - Keep your bedroom dark, cool, and quiet. If you sleep during the daytime, you may invest in blackout curtains to make your bedroom dark. Noise machines can also provide soothing sounds that may block out noisy neighbors, barking dogs, and other distractions. You might also talk to your doctor about alternative insomnia treatments that don't involve medications or supplements, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), UV light therapy, or orofacial therapy. CBT can help you change attitudes and behaviors that negatively impact your sleep. UV light therapy may help regulate your sleep-wake cycle, and your doctor may recommend orofacial therapy as a sleep apnea treatment. What is the most popular natural sleep aid? The most popular natural OTC sleep aid is melatonin. Many consumers prefer this option because melatonin supplements boost levels of a hormone your body already creates naturally rather than changing body processes or introducing new substances. If you take melatonin to help you sleep, avoid ingesting more than the recommended dose to prevent diminishing your body's natural hormone production. When should I consider prescription sleeping pills? You may consider prescription sleep aids if you have tried lifestyle changes and perhaps an OTC dietary supplement and still have disordered sleeping that affects your daily life. Your doctor can help determine the best sleep aids for your needs, whether a natural supplement can help improve your sleep or you need a prescription medication. Keep in mind that prescription sleep aids only provide short-term relief, and you shouldn't take them consistently for longer than 14 days. Summary of the Best Over-The-Counter Sleep Aids [NooCube "}
