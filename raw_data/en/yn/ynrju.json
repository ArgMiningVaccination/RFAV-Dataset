Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)10/12/2022 1:43:12PM 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's Statement OVERVIEW This Legislative Appropriations Request for FY 2024-25 is developed as we collectively continue to manage through the impact of COVID-19, domestic and global events on public health and our state's economy. It is also predicated on a strategic assessment of the future of UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) as an academic medical center and foundational State support needed for our institution to continue to serve Texas as an educator of physicians , scientists and other health care providers, and conductor of cutting-edge biomedical and public health research as a viable path forward from current and future health challenges. This request is also based on careful consideration of the Legislature's historic priorities for higher education in Texas that impact all of its Health Related Institutions (HRIs), including providing resources necessary to educate a world-class healthcare and research workforce, and upon UTSW's longstanding priority to secure performance-based investment in biomedical research, which forms the basis for a robust biotech industry to simultaneously expand the Texas economy while improving the quality and availability of healthcare for all Texans. BACKGROUND & OPERATIONS UTSW strives to achieve the public policy goals it was established to pursue and leverages the State's investment to obtain additional federal and private support to advance its education, research and patient care missions. The State's investment in UTSW pays dividends much greater than the cost, both in terms of external dollars generated and in results produced. Since its formation in WWI barracks in 1943, UTSW has grown into a multifaceted academic medical center engaged in education with four schools, a robust research enterprise, healthcare for millions of patients and considerable community service. From a team of 20, UTSW has expanded to a comprehensive faculty of ~3,300 and a total of ~24,000 employees, occupying ~15.3M sq. ft. of space. Administrative expense in FY21 was 2.38%, traditionally the lowest among state HRIs. Medical School & Graduate Medical Education A young school compared to its national peers, UTSW's Medical School is consistently ranked in the Top 25 among 190 nationally for research and primary care, the only public Texas school so rated. For 2023, only six institutions in the country rated above UTSW in both categories. As of 2022, UTSW has educated ~12,500 undergraduate physicians. At student capacity since the early 2000s, with an annual graduating class of ~240, the medical school is the 10th largest in the U.S. In FY22, 41% of our medical school graduates entered Primary Care residency and 56% of were practicing in Texas. UTSW also provides Continuing Medical Education to ~39,000 practicing physicians per year. The Graduate Medical Education program trains 1,405 residents in 122 accredited Primary and Specialty care programs across North Texas. Operating the largest public GME program in Texas, UTSW trains almost one in five doctors in the state. More than 30% of UTSW residents are in Primary Care programs, including the OB/GYN program that is the largest in the U.S., and its Internal Medicine and Pediatrics programs that are the largest and second largest, respectively, in Texas. UTSW's 99 Specialty Care programs, such as Emergency Medicine, Psychiatry and Neurosurgery, train residents in specialties with some of the greatest shortages in Texas. In total, UTSW graduates ~500 physicians per year from its GME programs and in FY21, 66% remained in practice in Texas. Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, School of Health Professions & new School of Public Health UTSW's Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and School of Health Professions are also highly regarded. The Graduate School trains ~1,000 students and Page 1 of 5 1Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)10/12/2022 1:43:12PM 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's Statement post-doctoral fellows, helping to produce the next generation of scientists, engineers and clinical researchers as the largest program encompassing ~30% of all biomedical sciences students in Texas. The Graduate School includes two divisions, Basic and Clinical Science, offering Ph.D. degrees in 12 areas such as Biomedical Engineering, Immunology and Neuroscience. A vibrant research enterprise is essential to the education of these students-most graduate training, by necessity for practice and accreditation standards, is done in the lab. The School of Health Professions, although smaller with an enrollment of 370, for 50+ years has been a leader in training students to meet needs in a range of fields with acute shortages, including Physical Therapy, Clinical Nutrition, Prosthetics-Orthotics and Physician Assistant studies, which is consistently ranked by US News & World Report a Top 10 program. Most programs are two years in length and effectively prepare students in a variety of academic, research and health care settings, resulting in high licensure pass rates and job placement and equipping students to care for a rapidly evolving patient population and with leadership training to help improve our care delivery system. In 2021, the UT System Board of Regents authorized and the 87th Legislature endorsed and appropriated matching start-up funds to establish the UTSW School of Public (SOPH) named in honor of long-standing institutional benefactor Peter O'Donnell Jr. Establishing this first new school at UTSW in 50 years has been a longstanding institutional strategic priority, the need for which has been made forcefully even more clear by the COVID pandemic. North Texans comprise the largest and fastest growing metro area in Texas but have had limited access to public health schools to provide guidance and the workforce needed to address public health needs , with Texas on average producing one public health graduate for every ~75,000 residents-last among the 5 most populous states in the country-and DFW lagging within Texas. These unmet needs became patent and acute throughout the COVID-19 public health emergency as UTSW experts necessarily stepped in to develop and implement diagnostic tests and labs, treatments, vaccination programs and a regional infection forecasting model and prevalence study, among other measures, to meet our campus needs and to help our region's businesses and residents plan their operations and navigate the pandemic. In response to these pressures, UTSW's public health school is being established on the foundation of its core strength in basic and clinical research, including expertise developed in fields such as population and data sciences, bioinformatics, and computational biology. The SOPH will enable UTSW to harness our faculty's pioneering research and institutional resources--reinforced through integral educational and clinical collaboration with area institutions and health systems--to help identify, predict, and address wide-scale health problems in our state before they occur and to quickly respond to public health emergencies as they arise. Accordingly, efforts will also focus on our long-term struggles to combat chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's, obesity, heart disease, and negative social determinants of health, as it is clear the prosperity of Texans requires a commitment to providing highest levels of evidence-based guidance to optimize our community's health and wellbeing. Current core expertise and faculty being recruited have positioned UTSW to: produce a new diverse generation of public health leaders and workforce that reflects Texas' population as students will be offered training and experience in forecasting infectious diseases, advancing novel bioinformatics, data and implementation science, and other disciplines; undertake innovative and actionable research to prevent disease and improve health outcomes for all Texans; and inform public policy with usable data inclusive of the health and economic impact of public health challenges. Approval has been received from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board for the Master of Public Health and the first class of MPH and dual MD /MPH students will enroll in Fall 2023. Planning is underway to secure approval for the Public Health Doctoral Program within the year, as well as rigorous Council on Education for Public Health school accreditation. Patient Care - Enhanced by Education & Research Page 2 of 5 2Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)10/12/2022 1:43:12PM 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's Statement Although UTSW receives no State appropriation to support clinical facilities or services, we provide an enormous amount of primary and specialty care to patients from the area, and to patients referred from across Texas and the U.S. who require specialty care that only a top-ranked academic center can provide. Approximately 4M outpatients and 117,000 hospitalized patients, including 360,000 emergency room cases, are treated annually. Patients are cared for at two UTSW owned and operated State hospital facilities, William P. Clements Jr. University Hospital and Zale Lipshy University Hospital Pavilion. Clements University Hospital is a state-of-the art 750-bed teaching facility expanded in 2020 to provide more operating rooms, Emergency Medicine capacity, and inpatient beds. Clements was supported by faculty who dedicated their own earning to its construction and designed to integrate teaching and research missions while driving quality in patient care. Since opening in 2014, Clements has been ranked 2nd among all hospitals in Texas by US News & World Report, and patient satisfaction surveys put it in the top 1% of hospitals nationally. UTSW's goal is to continue pioneering a patient-centric hospital at the frontiers of science and clinical transformation -offering broad expertise from cancer and organ transplant services to cardiology and obstetrics-so Texans need never leave the state to access comprehensive care on par with world-renowned centers like the Mayo Clinic. Through the quality of its providers and research, UTSW works to offer the most advanced care to all patients. Its Simmons Cancer Center was the second in Texas to secure NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center designation; our nursing team has secured Magnet designation, the highest honor awarded by the American Nurses Credentialing Center to only 7% of hospital systems, signifying nursing excellence and research driven high-quality patient care. UTSW is certified as the only Advanced Comprehensive Stroke Center in NTX; and access to some of the most innovative treatments is available only through clinical trials at UTSW and telehealth services offered to patients across the region. UTSW also extends its health care delivery into the community with primary and specialty care clinics located in areas to the west and north, Ft. Worth, central Dallas and opening in Summer 2022, the RedBird Outpatient Medical Center in southern Dallas, offering services-from primary care to cardiology, neurology, oncology including infusion therapy for cancer patients, imaging, sickle cell and other health issues as well clinical trials access-to underserved areas of our city. Significant care is also provided at our major teaching hospital partners, Parkland (one of the largest teaching hospitals in the U.S.), Children's Health (nationally ranked in 10 pediatric specialties), Texas Scottish Rite, the North Texas V A, and many other locations across the region. A clinically integrated network, Southwestern Health Resources, also provides access to highest-quality, coordinated primary and specialty care with 29 hospitals and 3,000+ physicians spanning a 16-county NTX service area, encompassing 7M+ residents. UTSW physicians provide ~$110M in uncompensated care, ~3% of our entire University expense. While no funding for patient care is received from the State or UT System, the success of UTSW's university health system has historically generated funds, ~$125M per year, that have been reinvested to support more education. Behavioral Health Care - Dallas State Psychiatric Hospital & Texas Child Mental Health Care Consortium Dallas State Psychiatric Hospital - partnership with Texas Health & Human Service Commission: In 2021, the 87th Legislature appropriated funds to HHSC to partner with UTSW to design, construct and operate the first state psychiatric hospital to serve the Dallas-Fort Worth area. UTSW has begun planning and engagement with community stakeholders to develop an advanced medical center-led teaching hospital that will deliver cutting-edge treatments to civil and forensic patients while training behavioral health care providers and developing the next generation of therapies. The hospital located in the Southwestern Medical Center will be an essential component of HHSC's plan to create a state-of-the-art mental health system to provide care to the most vulnerable Texans living in the surrounding Metroplex. The State Hospital is funded through HHSC, will include approximately 200 adult acute care inpatient beds with optionality to expand adult or pediatric capacity, and is projected to open by Fall 2025. Texas Child Mental Health Care Consortium (TCMHCC) - UTSW participation and role: In 2019, the 86th Legislature established the TCMHCC to expand clinical, research and educational services to meet the mental health care needs of children and adolescents in Texas. As one of the HRI members, UTSW maintains robust participation Page 3 of 5 3Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)10/12/2022 1:43:12PM 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's Statement with our faculty providing the bulk of services to NTX in all five TCMHCC initiatives, including the: Child Psychiatry Access Network; Texas Child Health Access Through Telemedicine; Community Psychiatry Workforce Expansion; Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Fellowships program; and as one of two leads in the Consortium's research initiative, which has created two state-wide networks to study and improve the delivery of child and adolescent mental health services. Specifically, UTSW's Center for Depression and Clinical Care is leading the multi-institutional Texas Youth Depression and Suicide Research Network, with the goal of examining interventions and population health outcomes statewide to advance evidence-based care for depression and suicide. TCMHCC also is supporting the UTSW-led partnership with HRIs statewide to begin voluntary implementation of the school-based Youth Aware of Mental Health program (YAM) that has operated in NTX schools since 2016 to help reach adolescents before they are in a mental health crisis. YAM is a school-and evidenced-based mental health promotion and suicide prevention program helping students to build resilience and learn to identify and seek help with depression, suicide, and other mental health needs they and their peers face that has shown significant positive outcomes-a key prevention piece that has been lacking in current statewide efforts. Since the tragic Robb Elementary event, UTSW has also received legislative requests for input on additional mental health efforts that can be explored. While recent Legislative investment will enable YAM to begin to address the critical missing piece of prevention in schools, along with supporting expansion of the program, UTSW clinical experts recommend another prevention element that would complement YAM and is a natural precursor to the TCMHCC Texas Child Health Access Through Telemedicine program. UTSW recommends developing \"Wellness Ambassadors\"-who can be existing school personnel-that UTSW could train to work in concert with school counselors to help identify students who are just beginning to experience symptoms of mental illness, as well as those who are experiencing high environmental stressors that put them at greater risk. Wellness Ambassadors would also facilitate connecting students to mental health services already available through the state's remarkable investment in TCMHCC. Research - Essential to Excellence in Education & Patient Care UTSW has earned a global reputation as a top research institution. Many of its faculty have achieved recognition for accomplishments in research, which is integral to excellence in patient care and education. Six UTSW faculty have been awarded the Nobel Prize. The first in 1987 for research that led to the development of cholesterol-controlling statin drugs-recognizing work performed in Texas, a first in Nobel history-and the most recent in 2013 for seminal discoveries in cellular transport systems, with applications to all organ systems. UTSW also leads Texas in having 26 faculty elected to the National Academy of Sciences-the \"hall of fame\" for American scientists (with another member elected in 2022), 17 in the National Academy of Medicine, and 14 of the 18 Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigators in Texas-three of the most objective national measures of faculty excellence. In a significant achievement-and external validation of the strength of biomedical research in Texas-in 2022, UTSW was again ranked #1 within the healthcare category internationally for publishing high-quality scientific research, according to the renowned Nature Index Annual Tables. This global listing evaluates institutions based on the number of peer-reviewed research articles published in the most prestigious scientific journals, and placed UTSW above peers such as Massachusetts General Hospital, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Columbia University. The Nature Index for innovation also again ranked UTSW #5 in the world in the number of published research articles cited as significant sources in third-party patent applications. This new metric evaluates an institution's impact on industrial innovation-how a scientific discovery leads to the commercialization of new therapies. While we are proud of our faculty's accomplishments, such recognition represents far more than academic accolades. Each day, Texans directly benefit from our research as discoveries made at UTSW are translated into treatments. We have 500+ basic science and translational research labs on campus, and 550+ clinical trials annually, focused on improving therapy for patients suffering from many conditions, with select areas of expertise and institutional focus on remaining at the forefront of medical progress in: neuroscience through the Peter O'Donnell Brain Institute, which includes the Center for Depression Research & Clinical Care and the State- funded Texas Page 4 of 5 4Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)10/12/2022 1:43:12PM 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1Administrator's Statement Institute for Brain Injury & Disease; Obesity, Cholesterol, Metabolism, and Diabetes; Cancer Therapeutics; Heart Disease and Stroke; Advanced Medical Imaging; and Gene Therapy. Research - State support & ROI Major patient care breakthroughs are the culmination of years of scientific endeavor and could not happen without consistent core research State funding. UTSW is grateful that in 2021, the 87th Legislature adopted the UTSW Performance-Based Research Operations Formula as a permanent funding mechanism specific to our institution's research mission. The importance of the accountable and increased predictability of this formula funding mechanism compared to Non-Formula Support for this work cannot be overstated. State support is essential to seeding our scientists' life-saving discoveries. It enabled UTSW to pivot efforts to 300+ projects researching for improved COVID-19 therapies and a vaccine-including the recent development of a rapid test that accurately identifies an infected patient's COVID variant to aid in personalized treatment. State support remains essential as we continue to work on this and the many other diseases that afflict our population. Research investment also pays significant economic dividends to the State. In FY21, UTSW had $554M in research and a substantial majority of those funds come from out of state competitive sources such as NIH. Since the UTSW Performance-Based Research Operations Formula was adopted as a pilot in 2019, UTSW implemented a Research Faculty Incentive Plan that in three short years has increased UTSW's ROI on every $1 appropriated for research from 7:1 to almost 9:1 in external funds brought to Texas-a remarkable total increase of $100M or 23% that correlates with implementation of the new performance-based formula. UTSW discoveries have also led to the creation of 80+ biotech companies, raising $2B+ invested in Texas, and 1,100+ technology license deals, resulting in ~$281M in licensing revenue to date. The conversion of UTSW's Performance-Based Research Operations Formula to a standing, accountable formula funding stream will enable UTSW to consistently and exponentially capitalize on the State's investment and augment its contributions to Texas' economy--as long as institutional performance is match -funded by the Legislature per the formula methodology. The importance of the State's seeding of a sound research platform and expert scientists capable of combatting disease became increasingly evident as we confronted COVID-19, and as our own State Comptroller has cited the human value of biotech and the need to advance this sector in Texas as the only major industry that has lagged in our state. Continued investment to seed the basic science that feeds the biotech industry will deliver not only short-term economic benefit and jobs to Texas but long-term patient benefit and diversification of our economy.

Strategy Request 2 STRATEGY: 1 Research Activities 2025729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Performance Based Research Operations UTSW is a research-intensive, at-capacity institution that capitalizes on foundational state funds to seed its research mission-an integral driver of excellence in its education and patient care. The Performance Based Research Formula seeds core operations and technologies needed to support UTSW's researchers. Home to the largest biomedical sciences PhD program and the only public medical school in Texas consistently ranked by US News & World Report among the top 30 research institutions nationally, UTSW long relied upon Non-Formula \"Special Items\" to secure state research support. In the absence of an adequate formula mechanism, given the HRI Research Formula has eroded to a 1.18% match for every $100M in research expenditures, Non-Formula items were UTSW's only option for almost two decades to secure sufficient support. However, the nature of Non-Formula items-intended for targeted short-term purposes and typically disproportionately cut in economic recessions-created instability across biennia and are ill-equipped to sustain core institutional infrastructure. Conversion of Non-Formula funds to a more predictable performance formula provides an accountable mechanism to earn state support to seed research that catalyzes patient breakthroughs and reaps external investment, resulting in an up to 9:1 ROI in external grants at UTSW and increasing the state's economic output. Withdrawal of this funding jeopardizes the foundation on which UTSW's robust research enterprise is built. EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS IMPACTING STRATEGY: 3.A.

Strategy Request 2 STRATEGY: 1 Research Activities 2025729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Performance Based Research Operations UTSW's Performance Based Research Operations Formula is driven by the institution and its researchers' ability to secure competitive research grant support , as measured by its annual institutional research expenditures. The formula's Performance Base Match and Tiered Increase Match are calculated based on the increase or decrease in the average annual research expenditures and are a true measure of recent performance as well as ability to maintain top nationally-ranked levels of research over time. Before the global COVID-19 pandemic presented, the quality of UTSW and its faculty compared to researchers nationally was the critical external factor driving our institutional performance and research formula funding. While this remains the case, COVID has had additional impact on institutions forced to make the correct choice for patient care by halting all research except for COVID related projects from March into June, in order to conserve personal protective equipment and to ensure the safety of faculty, students and staff. Consequently, core research technologies and labs will require significant reinvestment to ramp back up to full capacity. This type of infrastructure support is not provided by federal grants or other typical sources of research support including philanthropy, making the State performance research funding essential to UTSW's phased restoration and ongoing contributions to our state's recovery.STRATEGY BIENNIAL TOTAL - ALL FUNDS Base Spending (Est 2022 + Bud 2023) Baseline Request (BL 2024 + BL 2025)BIENNIAL CHANGE EXPLANATION OF BIENNIAL CHANGE $ Amount Explanation(s) of Amount (must specify MOFs and FTEs)EXPLANATION OF BIENNIAL CHANGE (includes Rider amounts): $88,749,567 $0 $(88,749,567) $(88,749,567) Formula funded strategies are not requested in 2024-25 because amounts are not determined by institutions.

Strategy Request 1 STRATEGY: 1 Residency 2025729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Primary Care Residency Training Program Medical education is only partially complete when the M.D. degree is awarded. Further education in accredited residency programs is essential for the development of the full range of knowledge and skills to perform medical diagnosis and treatment and the certification required for a doctor to practice. This residency education is a major part of the primary mission of all Texas medical schools. UTSW shoulders the burden of training the vast majority of residents, in primary and specialty care, in all of N Texas. Consequently, it has more residents than every other State institution, and thus bears the greatest share of the State's resident costs. Serving the mission of training residents has significant costs, and the primary cost borne by medical schools is that of providing education by faculty. A portion of the costs associated with faculty supervising the care residents provide is paid with Medicare GME funds. Other than the State GME formula, which pays only ~1/3rd of the ~$18,000 annual per resident faculty supervision cost, there are no dedicated funds for residents' education. This strategy helps fund the disproportionate cost UTSW bears in educating one of the State's largest number of primary care residents , including direct resident support through payment of 15 stipends. It is essential to continue the number and quality of primary care residency programs at UTSW since such programs are the most important source of primary care doctors in N Texas and statewide.

Historically Underutilized Business Supporting Schedule COMPARISON TO STATEWIDE HUB PROCUREMENT GOALS Statewide HUB GoalsProcurement CategoryTotal Expenditures FY 2020A. Fiscal Year - HUB Expenditure Information % Goal % Actual Actual $ Actual $ % Actual % Goal Diff $111,962,510 $1,425,872,059 Attainment: UT Southwestern Medical Center exceeded the statewide HUB percentage goal in 1 of 5 categories in fiscal year 2020 and exceeded its internal HUB procurement goals in 2 of the 5 categories in fiscal year 2020. UT Southwestern Medical Center did not exceed any of the statewide HUB Procurement Goals in fiscal year 2021. However, UT Southwestern exceeded its internal HUB goals in 2 of the 5 categories in fiscal year 2021.B. Assessment of Attainment of HUB Procurement Goals 13.1% 7.9% The \"Heavy Construction\" category is not applicable to UT Southwestern Medical Center's operations; therefore, the agency does not have any strategies or programs for this category. UT Southwestern Medical Center is focused on its education, research, and patient care mission. Its construction activity relates to renovation and construction contracts issued for facilities related to its mission.Applicability: UT Southwestern has been successful in generating HUB expenditures in the \"Building Construction\" category. Much focus is placed on contracting and managing HUB expenditures incurred by prime contractors and their subcontractors. There are two specific areas that limit the agency's performance against Statewide goals: non-impactable spend and mission-driven physician preference for goods and services that uniquely align research objectives and the needs of UT Southwestern's patients.Factors Affecting Attainment: 6.A. Page 1 of 2 and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST)Date: Time: 1:43:38PM10/12/2022 88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Agency: 729 Agency Code:6.A. Historically Underutilized Business Supporting Schedule In fiscal year 2021, nearly 30% of expenditures were considered non-impactable, meaning there is no HUB vendor that for the good or service. Product purchases, such as pharmaceuticals, specialized equipment, and research animals make up a significant portion of the non-impactable spend. Other costs include maintenance agreements with large corporations (e.g., Epic, Microsoft) and services such as robotic systems, research services, and contracted clinical staff. To meet the needs of high-acuity patients and research subjects with rare health challenges, purchases are often proprietary and therefore sole sourced from large, cutting-edge corporations that are not HUB certified. UT Southwestern has a strategic focus on increasing awareness of the HUB program for new supplier opportunities and increasing awareness of the contract opportunities for existing HUB suppliers. UT Southwestern continues to build lasting relationships with advocacy organizations in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex to maximize visibility in the community. A representative list of engagement and outreach activities includes: Proactive communication to advocacy organizations about bid opportunities to be disseminated to their members Attending and/or hosting regional HUB conferences, workshops, and outreach sessions in collaboration with local supplier diversity advocacy organizations Conducting quarterly HUB Staff Coordinating Committee meetings Meeting one-on-one with diverse suppliers Quarterly meetings between facilities team and regional HUB contractors Focus groups with Community Advocate Organizations Providing training sessions to HUB vendors to help them navigate contracting with state entities.Outreach Efforts and Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Programs:C. Good-Faith Efforts to Increase HUB Participation UT Southwestern recently reorganized its HUB team, which included expanding the team and recruiting a dedicated Director of Supplier Diversity and HUB. The team is now comprised of four (4) FTE's.HUB Program Staffing: UT Southwestern continues to optimize its analysis and support HUB purchasing efforts to improve HUB performance . Influencing internal decision makers, such as department level staff who independently identify and make necessary purchases for their specific operations , is a key component of this goal. To that end, UT Southwestern has: Placed a prominent HUB identifier on HUB suppliers' pages within UT Southwestern's procurement portal so that requestors and shoppers can immediately recognize opportunities at the department purchasing level, which is expected to increase participation in the program across the institution Developed a comprehensive internal HUB training program that reiterates the value of diversity and the benefits supplier diversity brings to the agency. This mandatory training will be rolled out to all department employees who make purchasing decisions.Current and Future Good-Faith Efforts: 6.A.

Institutional Enhancement funding at UT Southwestern supports leading-edge and innovative programs in medical education to help provide the highest quality education and training in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease to our medical students. (3) (a) Major Accomplishments to Date: Institutional Enhancement support has contributed to maintaining the highest standard of excellence in the missions state has entrusted to UT Southwestern . A young school compared to its national peers, UTSW's Medical School was again highly ranked in the U.S. News & World Report 2023 Best Graduate Schools report, 16th for Primary Care and 25th for Research, making UTSW the only public institution in Texas ranked in the Top 25. UT Southwestern's Clements University Hospital was also ranked the No. 1 hospital in Dallas-Fort Worth and No. 2 in Texas for the fifth consecutive year (2021-22). As a large employer, UT Southwestern was voted in a Forbes survey as one of America's Top 10 employers, #1 in Texas in 2022. (3) (b) Major Accomplishments Expected During the Next 2 Years: UTSW will continue to expand and update existing clinical training programs and develop new programs to sustain the quality of our medical education . Major objectives for the school are the integration and expansion of programs in the basic and clinical neurosciences, including the O'Donnell Brain Institute's move to a third tower expansion at Clements University Hospital that is dedicated to patients suffering from cognitive diseases of the aging brain and clinical research to address this ever-increasing patient need. UT Southwestern will also continue growing its programs in clinical investigation, including epidemiology, medical informatics, bioinformatics, and clinical trials along with the continued development of new programs in population and health outcomes research. While the extent and comprehensive costs of these programs continues to be defined, student participation will require additional State support.

An important component of its medical education is accomplished for ~675 students in the second, third and fourth years of medical school when they rotate through the many clinical clerkships offered. Medical students participate first-hand in-patient management, learning how to apply the information they learned in the first 1.5 years of medical school, and acquiring new knowledge. The excellence of these clinical programs is one of the reasons UTSW is a highly regarded medical school and is sought after by the most qualified medical school applicants from across Texas and beyond. In the past, programs such as oncology and clinical epidemiology have been targets for development to support excellence in medical education. UTSW must remain constantly vigilant to identify new clinical training programs that must be developed or expanded to maintain our cutting-edge medical education. However, as all funding sources contract, established primary care programs that are equally essential to medical education, such as Family Practice and Internal Medicine, are now also supported with these funds. Any reductions to this funding would impact the level of training that we have been able to deliver to students.(9) Impact of Not Funding: Institutional Enhancement support is needed on an ongoing basis to supplement and enhance core educational operations for our medical student clinical training rotations. Institutional enhancement funding is essential to UTSW's ability to educate and train tomorrow's physicians. State support for educating medical students has declined since the state higher education funding formulas were conceived, and faces further reductions as new medical schools have been established but funding has not kept pace with student growth. This funding, which has experienced a 31% reduction since 2010- 11, is essential for UT Southwestern to maintain quality education for our medical students and ensuring program quality in increasingly costly medical school operations.(10) Non-Formula Support Needed on Permanent Basis/Discontinu N/A as non-formula support is needed on a permanent basis.(11) Non-Formula Support Associated with Time Frame: Suggested performance metrics associated with permanent funding are reflected in Section 13.(12) Benchmarks: Institutional enhancement allows UTSW to maintain medical school program quality. Performance can be assessed by UTSW's maintenance of its top 25 ranking among medical schools nationally.(13) Performance Reviews: Page 2 of 14 90Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical CenterSchedule 9: Non-Formula Support 10/12/2022 1:43:40PM 88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Peter O'Donnell Jr. School of Public Health (1) Year Non-Formula Support Item First Funded: 2022 Original Support Item (2) Mission: The mission of the new UT Southwestern School of Health is to advance public health broadly through groundbreaking and actionable research to address not only infectious disease and rare pandemics as they present, but also the pressing need to identify, predict, and address wide scale and chronic health problems - such as diseases of the heart, obesity, cancer, substance abuse and mental illness - before they occur; to unlock and address social determinants driving disparities in access to healthcare and outcomes; and to produce a diverse, quality public health workforce to improve healthcare outcomes for all Texans. (3) (a) Major Accomplishments to Date: Degree program approval has been received from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board for the Master of Public Health to allow the first class of MPH and dual MD/MPH students to enroll in Fall 2023. Faculty recruitment has also been successful. An Associate Dean for Academic Affairs (Professor) and Assistant Dean for Student Affairs & Operations (Asst. Professor) have been recruited, along with five additional faculty with expertise ranging from Health Economics to Health Behavior and Data Science, to complement existing experts from the UTSW Departments of Epidemiology, Population Health and Bioinformatics who have nucleated the SOPH. Start-up funds appropriated by the 87th Legislature required UTSW to obtain a 2:1 match from other sources to secure the $10 million in state support. UT Southwestern successfully secured a $100 million gift from the O'Donnell Foundation to endow and support its new School of Public Health. This investment is the largest gift to a School of Public Health at a public university in the U.S. and matches the third largest gift supporting any School of Public Health. Yet, it is important to note that these funds are dedicated to establishing an endowment fund for faculty retention in the future and will provide only a small portion of the annual operating funds needed for current recruitment and other operations of the school. (3) (b) Major Accomplishments Expected During the Next 2 Years: The School of Public Health will open and the first class of MPH and dual MD/MPH students will matriculate in Fall 2023. Planning is underway to secure approval for the Public Health Doctoral Program within the year, as well as rigorous national Council on Public Health school accreditation. Ongoing searches for faculty Directors for the Pediatric Population Health Program and the Implementation Science Program are expected to be complete, allowing for significant further educational and research program development.

Instructional Support(6) Category: (7) Transitional Funding: N 2022 $ 100,000,000 Endowment from the O'Donnell Foundation(8) Non-General Revenue Sources of Funding: Without the meaningful endorsement from the Texas Legislature to establish the School of Public Health and commitment to provide state start -up support, UT Southwestern would have been hampered in its efforts to obtain additional funding. The state's seed funding accelerated UTSW's ability to secure external investment. Without the state support, there would be a significant delay in opening the much-needed School of Public Health to serve the North Texas region and our state.(9) Impact of Not Funding: Non-formula support is needed to support the on-going costs required to establish the operational structure necessary to educate the students in this field.(10) Non-Formula Support Needed on Permanent Basis/Discontinu N/A(11) Non-Formula Support Associated with Time Frame: The School's performance can be measured with ongoing progress in: - Faculty recruitment - Degree program approval - Research funds secured, and - Students enrolled.(12) Benchmarks: N/A(13) Performance Reviews: Page 4 of 14 92Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical CenterSchedule 9: Non-Formula Support 10/12/2022 1:43:40PM 88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Primary Care Residency Training (1) Year Non-Formula Support Item First Funded: 1996 Original Appropriation: $1,557,500 Year Non-Formula Support Item Established: 1996 (2) Mission: Medical education is only partially complete when the M.D. degree is awarded. Further education in an accredited residency program is essential for the development of the full range of knowledge and skills to perform medical diagnosis and treatment, and to achieve the certification required for a doctor to practice. As a primary mission of Texas' medical schools, the institution absorbs the greatest share of costs not covered by federal and state funds. Specifically, faculty train residents at a significant cost that is primarily borne by the institution. A small portion of the education costs are supported with Medicare GME funds and the State GME formula, which pays a fraction of the approximately $62,3000 annual cost to train primary care residents (excluding the resident stipend/salary and benefits). UTSW has long supplemented its graduate medical education programs to help support one of the State's largest primary care residency programs , including direct resident support through payment of 35 stipends. Texas continues to lag in training enough doctors to meet growing demand, making this funding essential to continue the number and quality of primary care residency programs at UTSW as a pipeline of primary care doctors both in North Texas and statewide . (3) (a) Major Accomplishments to Date: This item critically supports the statewide goal of decreasing the shortage of primary care doctors and providing quality primary care to the citizens of Texas . UT Southwestern continues to run the largest public school residency program, with 437 residents in primary care programs. We have expanded upon the combined training program in Internal Medicine/Pediatrics initiated in 2016 to 16 positions. Additionally, the Family Medicine Residency program, which was expanded in 2017 to include the Texas Health Dallas training site, now includes 42 trainees. (3) (b) Major Accomplishments Expected During the Next 2 Years: Approximately 30% of UT Southwestern's 1,405 residents are in primary care programs. At maturity, the Family Medicine and Internal Medicine/Pediatrics training programs provide a total of 58 primary care training residency positions. UT Southwestern intends to continue maintaining one of the largest and most competitive primary care residency training programs in Texas in order to continue graduating ~125 primary care doctors every year. This number will continue to grow as programs expand and residencies are complete, helping to address the shortage of primary care doctors and provide quality primary care to the citizens of Texas.

Further budget reductions would have similar impact. With increasing pressure on other sources of funding and no other funding dedicated to this purpose , a reduction in primary care residency program funding would not be replaced and would impact the quality of the education received by the second largest number of primary care residents among Texas health institutions, it would also directly result in a reduction in the number of primary care residents trained. With an existing shortage of primary care doctors practicing in the state, particularly as we collectively continue to respond to COVID-19, Texas can ill afford to lose any primary care residency positions at any institution across the state.(9) Impact of Not Funding: N/A as non-formula support is needed on a permanent basis.(10) Non-Formula Support Needed on Permanent Basis/Discontinu Funding for the Primary Residency Training Program is needed on a permanent basis as it is critical to addressing the physician shortage in Texas . Moreover, as medical graduates increase statewide with the advent of new schools, the number of residency positions must keep pace as they are necessary to ensure graduates do not leave the State for other residency opportunities. This funding pays a small portion of the costly training of tomorrow's doctors but there is no other source , especially as COVID-19 response resulted in significant revenue losses at UTSW from which are continuing to recover, and is essential to producing practicing physicians to provide needed care to a consistently-growing population.(11) Non-Formula Support Associated with Time Frame: Suggested performance metrics associated with permanent funding are reflected in Section 13.(12) Benchmarks: Page 6 of 14 94Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical CenterSchedule 9: Non-Formula Support 10/12/2022 1:43:40PM 88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Retention and expansion of residency training programs.

STARS Program Goals: to improve secondary school science education in North Texas and beyond, to increase science awareness, to stimulate interest in STEM fields, to provide ongoing teacher/student support, to offer content and instructional aides, and to broaden the knowledge base of teachers. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, STARS quickly innovated and offered its 20 programs and projects via a hybrid educational format to meet the needs of the fluid global environment. This accessibility broadened our reach beyond North Texas and enabled STARS to continually offer no-cost high-quality programs to thousands of teachers and tens of thousands of students annually, furthering its mission. STARS also maintains important relationships with large urban school districts such as Cedar Hill, Dallas, Ft. Worth, Garland, Grand Prairie, and Irving and is represented on state and many district advisory boards, to promote participation of diverse student populations in STARS functions. (3) (a) Major Accomplishments to Date: STARS offers teacher professional development services and student STEM engagement programs, all free of charge and many with paid stipends. These include: monthly Basic Science Symposium, In-service and STEM Career Discovery Program; 8-week Summer Research Programs for students (900 applications for 50 spots) and teachers; customized Medical Center Tours (3-4/week); Science Fair Support; Careers in Biomedical Sciences and Women in Science & Medicine symposia; Science Ambassador and Student Mentoring Programs; and hands-on summer Anatomy & Physiology, Biology, Biotechnology, Chemistry, Physics, and Middle School Camps. Teachers and students utilize STARS resources, such as software, videos, instruments, and science kits. Newer initiatives include customized district Professional Development sessions, AP-Biology symposia, plus special collaborations with the Perot Museum, UT Dallas, and many more. STARS, a recipient of the national 2020 Inspiring Programs in STEM Award, quickly innovated its programs to a virtual, then hybrid educational platform during the pandemic, maintained high-quality programs, and notably increased teacher and student participation by 9% and 21%, respectively, in the past 2 years. Since its 1991 inception, STARS has grown to serve 25,000+ teachers from 4,500 schools, plus ~120,000 students have been impacted by teacher and direct student participation. Each year, there has been tremendous program growth and soaring demand from teachers and students.

Without State support, valuable hybrid or in-person professional development for teachers will be curtailed, and the 8-10 point improvement students have shown on End of Course science related exams will suffer, students will be unable to tour medical facilities or connect with STEM professionals which inspire a career in STEM, and students seeking early research opportunities through the program will have to search for alternative options when already only 6% of applicants can be accommodated. The program's biomedical science careers pipeline would also cease as many former students have proceeded to pursue STEM professions and matriculated into UTSW and other Texas professional schools, enriching the healthcare science workforce and industry. Unfortunately, external funds have been far more challenging to obtain in the last few years as science and outreach budgets tighten, making state support even more critical. For example, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute stopped its pre-college programs in 2012, and the NIH has transferred much of its outreach budget to fund its core research mission. Similarly, state funding has been reduced by 34% since FY11-12 which makes remaining support all the more essential to maintain STARS activities.(9) Impact of Not Funding: Core support for STARS is needed on a permanent basis to maintain and continue the remarkably oversubscribed program. The continuing hybrid and in-person programs ensure that North Texas students and teachers have access to invaluable STEM related hands-on and instructional professional development (PD); STEM engagement programs such as symposia, summer science camps, science-medicine career discovery programs, science fair support, customized teacher PD sessions, student mentoring and science ambassador programs; research opportunities and tours of medical facilities. This program fosters curiosity and innovation among our youngest Texans, who will ultimately steer the future of science and medicine in the 21st century and concurrently help to drive our state's economy.(10) Non-Formula Support Needed on Permanent Basis/Discontinu N/A as non-formula support is needed on a permanent basis.(11) Non-Formula Support Associated with Time Frame: Suggested performance metrics associated with permanent funding are reflected in Section 13.(12) Benchmarks: STARS provides high-quality STEM related hybrid and in-person teacher professional development programs, student-focused STEM engagement programs throughout the school year and summers that include research opportunities, symposia, science-medicine career discovery programs, science fair support, student mentoring and science ambassador programs, tours and summer science camps to the North Texas region. Performance can be assessed as follows: - number of teacher participants - number of student participants - numbers of schools impacted - number of summer research program applicants and slots available - number of summer science camp applicants and slots available.(13) Performance Reviews: Page 10 of 14 98Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical CenterSchedule 9: Non-Formula Support 10/12/2022 1:43:40PM 88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Page 11 of 14 99Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical CenterSchedule 9: Non-Formula Support 10/12/2022 1:43:40PM 88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Regional Burn Care Center (1) Year Non-Formula Support Item First Funded: 1978 Original Appropriation: $125,000 Year Non-Formula Support Item Established: 1978 (2) Mission: To provide state-of-the-art comprehensive acute burn care, burn rehabilitation, education, supplies, and banked skin allograft tissues for clinical transplant for adult and pediatric patients and healthcare professionals. The Center is the only American Burn Association and American College of Surgeons-verified burn center in North Texas, providing a regional resource for disaster management for those with burns. (3) (a) Major Accomplishments to Date: The Burn Center continues to support faculty, fellow, resident, student, and advanced clinical personnel training in burn treatment as well as providing state-of-the-art care for Texans. In 2021, the Center admitted 727 patients (26% children) and over the past 3 years clinical outcomes such as mortality were very low, roughly 3.4% of patients admitted, which is below the national standard according to ABA reports. Hospital length of stay remains below national norms. There were also over 3,500 visits to the Burn Outpatient Clinic in FY21. Educating the next generation of providers remains a focus, with ~80 residents rotating through the center annually from 5 residency programs. The Center has also developed a Burn Surgery Fellowship that includes a Critical Care Certification for the most highly specialized care for burn patients. Improvements in clinical outcomes and education are due to many factors, significantly supported by State funds. Advancements in resuscitation including patented technology, improved quality of surgical intervention, and improved metabolic support are only a few of the advances produced. Equally important, the Center continues to serve as a state and national resource for teaching and referral for the latest techniques in burn care and prevention, and leveraging of State funds has resulted in continued high national and international recognition and successful competition for federal grants. (3) (b) Major Accomplishments Expected During the Next 2 Years: The Center combines emergency care and in-hospital treatment of acute pediatric and adult burns, as well as reconstructive surgery and rehabilitation to meet the UT-Southwestern mission to provide the best comprehensive burn care. While providing world-class burn care, the Center will remain active in clinical research to further improve understanding and efficacy of treatments to improve outcomes in burns. Through these efforts, the Center also serves to advance the goals of medical care, improved patient survival and morbidity. In addition, excellence in research and patient care allows the Center to continue to actively improve and provide excellence in education for fellows, residents, medical students and professional health students in clinical and rehabilitative burn treatment.

Loss or further reduction of funding would also delay development and implementation of regional disaster management preparedness, and significantly hinder education and training for students, resident and other providers of burn care.(9) Impact of Not Funding: Funding for the Regional Burn Care Center is needed on a permanent basis to enable continuous provision of state-of-the-art burn care and education in this critical field. The only pediatric American Burn Association and American College of Surgeons-verified burn center in North Texas, the Regional Burn Care Center is critical to serving the region for these acute, life-threatening and intensely painful injuries. The Center's expert staff is also responsible for training tomorrow's specialists in burn care and prevention. Finally, the state's support is leveraged to bring in more outside dollars to support the education, research and patient care the Center provides.(10) Non-Formula Support Needed on Permanent Basis/Discontinu N/A as non-formula support is needed on a permanent basis.(11) Non-Formula Support Associated with Time Frame: Page 13 of 14 101Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical CenterSchedule 9: Non-Formula Support 10/12/2022 1:43:40PM 88th Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Suggested performance metrics associated with permanent funding are reflected in Section 13.(12) Benchmarks: Funding for the Center is critical to training tomorrow's burn specialists in prevention and treatment, providing infrastructure to support clinical trials, publishing peer-reviewed research findings that inform burn care, and attracting more dollars to the state.
