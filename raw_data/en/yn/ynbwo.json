Campbell's rise from a community school of 21 students to eminence as a great southern academy and later to its present standing among the state's largest church-related senior universities is illustrative of what perseverance can accomplish in scaling the heights. Campbell University was founded as Buies Creek Academy on January 5, 1887, by James Archibald Campbell, a North Carolina preacher who believed that no student should be denied admission because of lack of funds. In 1926, the school attained junior college status and changed its name from Buies Creek Academy to Campbell Junior College. In 1961, Campbell became a senior college. The name was changed to Campbell University on June 6, 1979. Graduate Programs begun in 1977, with the Master of Education degree. The Master of Science in Government was established in 1982. The Campbell University School of Law was founded in 1976, and the Lundy-Fetterman School of Business began in 1983. The Schools of Pharmacy and Education were established in 1985. The Divinity School was established in 1996. The School of Pharmacy was renamed as the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences in 2009. In addition to its main campus in Buies Creek, Campbell University has extended campuses in the Research Triangle Park, Camp Lejeune, Fort Bragg/Pope Air Force Base, and Raleigh, where the law school relocated to in 2009. Since 1979, Campbell has also partnered with Tunku Abdul Rahman College in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to offer a Bachelor of Science degree. Today, Campbell University enrolls approximately 6,000 students, including 4,000 undergraduate and graduate students on its main campus. They're studying across nearly 100 disciplines in the liberal arts, health sciences, and professions -- and continuing the university's tradition of excellence in faith, learning, and service. In over 100 years of service, Campbell University has been served by five presidents: James Archibald Campbell 1887-1934 Leslie Hartwell Campbell 1934-1967 Norman Adrian Wiggins 1967-2003 Jerry M.

The review date is contingent upon continued compliance with the Accreditation Standards and ARC-PA policy. Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant 12000 Findley Road, Suite 770-476-1738 Email: arcpa@arc-pa.orgNorth Carolina Board of Nursing The Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing received Initial Approval Status from the North Carolina Board of Nursing (NCBON) in January 2014. The NCBON will return for a second site survey and determine whether the program is in compliance with all rules for nursing programs. We anticipate that the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing will be receiving Full Approval Status in the spring of 2018. The Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing will seek professional or specialized accreditation from the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE). The CCNE accreditation evaluation consists of a review of the program's mission, goals, and expected outcomes; and an assessment of the performance of the program in achieving the mission, goals, and expected outcomes through the most effective utilization of available resources, programs, and administration. Our plan for initial accreditation is to submit a request for New Applicant Status , develop a self-study report and request a CCNE site survey team for fall 2017 or spring 2018. The Campbell University Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing has been approved for Institutional membership in the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (October 2014).

All services are free and confidential. Criminal Background Check & Drug Screening Introduction Organizations involved in health care research, development and delivery are held to high degree of integrity and also have an enormous liability for the products and services they provide. In order to mitigate risk, limit liabilities and protect the safety and well-being of patients and research subjects, criminal background checks (CBCs) and substance abuse screening tests (SASTs) have evolved into required components of the employment and educational processes at most health care facilities and research and development organizations for employees and learners. Additionally, CBCs and SASTs may be required prior to licensure to practice and maybe required for currently licensed health care professionals as defined by the associated regulatory boards. The College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences is being required to attest that CBCs and SASTs, plus other requirements (e.g. CPR, HIPAA compliance, health insurance, immunizations, etc.) have been completed prior to health professions students (nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy and physician assistant) being allowed to engage in experiential training at the clinical education sites as well as many internship sites for CPHS undergraduate degree programs. As a result of these movements, these required screens have become an important part of the process for matriculation of candidates seeking degree in the CPHS undergraduate and professional degree programs. If CPHS accepted applicants or students are not eligible for entry to the appropriate training sites in order to perform the mandatory experiential component(s) as required to complete their degree, then they are not eligible for matriculation at entry and /or progression through their designated program. Individuals in the graduate clinical research, pharmaceutical sciences or public health programs may be subject to CBCs and SASTs as a component of any current or future required or elective experiential training. Beginning in the academic year 2016- 2017, the cost of all CBCs and SASTs will be the responsibility of the individual accepted applicant/current student in the specified Campbell University CPHS program. Prior to students being permitted to participate in experiential education courses (clerkships, internships, etc.), they must submit to updated CDCs and SASTs. Students who: do not consent to the required CBC and SAST refuse to provide information necessary to conduct these screens in a timely manner and by the required deadlines provide false or misleading information or samples in regard to the CBC and SAST may lose their status of good standing and will be referred to the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. Sanctions may include loss of eligibility to apply for university scholarships, hold leadership positions, receive CPHS funding for professional meetings, loss of eligibility to participate in experiential education activities, and are subject to 6 | 2016-2017 Academic Bulletinsanction up to and including dismissal from the college in accordance with CHPS policies. Information from the updated CBCs and SASTs are kept as confidential as possible and are retained in a file separate from other educational and academic records. Information will be shared with the CPHS Experiential Education Screening Committee, the Associate Dean for Student Affairs & Admissions and with clinical education sites if there is a need to determine the acceptability of a student to the site. Additional considerations Admitted students cannot refuse assignment to a particular experiential site because they do not wish to submit to further substance abuse testing or criminal background checks required by the site. CPHS students who are refused admission to a training site, or who are asked to leave a site because of information discovered through any CBC and/or SAST will have a plan developed by the CPHS Experiential Education Screening Committee in an attempt to make the student more acceptable to clinical education sites. Affected students must follow the plan and any evaluation, assessment, treatment and rehabilitation guidelines required in the plan, before and/or during subsequent enrollment in experiential education courses. The requirements of the plan are not subject to appeal. The results of evaluation and the existence of treatment and rehabilitation guidelines imposed by the plan will be disclosed to the human resources office of the training site and/or to the individual preceptor as necessitated by the associated affiliation agreement. The College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences does not accept responsibility for any student being ineligible for coursework, training, continued enrollment in the college, or subsequent licensure for any reason, including failure to pass a CBC and/or SAST regardless of whether or not the student has participated in a plan attempting to make them acceptable to clinical education sites. The College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences does not accept responsibility to continually seek educational training sites who will accept health professions students previously denied access to any assigned site. Criminal Background Check Policy for Campbell University Health Programs The College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences requires criminal background checks (CBCs) of all nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy and physician assistant program applicants who earn acceptance into their respective health programs prior to matriculation. Current nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy and physician assistant students will also be required to have a CBC annually or as often as required by experiential sites. Students enrolled in the BS in clinical research and BS in pharmaceutical Sciences programs may be required to have a CBC in the B-2 semester, prior to matriculating into the mandatory B-2 internship. Currently, applicants and students enrolled in the MS in Clinical Research, MS in Pharmaceutical Sciences and MS in Public Health degree programs are not required to complete CBCs. Accepted applicants to any of the aforementioned Campbell University CPHS Health Programs will be notified of the background check requirement as part of the application/interview process. Failure to disclose any convictions or pending charges may result in reconsideration of an applicant's admissions status. Current students who fail to disclose new charges or convictions within the designated time period may result in reconsideration of a student's enrollment status. CPHS will contract with an outside vendor for the performance of the background check, and students will be responsible for the cost of the testing. Educational training sites may require CPHS to provide them with a copy of the results of any criminal background check performed on students prior to and for the duration of their placement at the site. Clinical education sites may set their own standards in regard to who they will admit based on the results of the criminal background screening or require further screening. Students must be willing to disclose and release the required personal information and CBC results in order to participate in clinical education activities. Students who are not willing to allow the release of the required personal information will not be able to be placed at an affiliated clinical education site, and thus cannot meet the requirements to continue their education and fulfill the curriculum requirements for graduation. Charges and convictions do not automatically prevent an applicant or current student from matriculating into or continuing in a professional health program within CPHS at Campbell University. Any charges or convictions as described above must be reviewed for potential impact on clinical activities required for the successful completion of the applicable health program and ultimately licensure eligibility. In such cases, the student may not be able to meet the requirements for progression in their program or graduation. Health sciences facilities providing student internships and clinical experiences for Campbell CPHS Health Programs have the right to review all CBC results, and ultimately have the ability to accept or deny the placement of any student based upon these results. Procedure A criminal background check will be completed on all CPHS health program accepted applicants prior to matriculation and on all current students annually or as required by clinical sites. Students accepted late in the admissions cycle will be given a date for completion of all testing. Failure to complete required testing in the specified time period may result in reconsideration of an applicant's admissions status. Accepted applicants and selected wait listed applicants will receive a letter from the College with detailed information about these requirements. The letter will explain the contingency that the final decision regarding matriculation will be made after review of the applicant's criminal background check report. Appropriate authorization, with pertinent identifying information necessary to initiate the check, will be received from each accepted applicant prior to initiating a criminal background check. This authorization will inform the accepted applicant that he or she will have access to criminal background check data about himself or herself to ensure the accuracy of the criminal background check report. CPHS contracts with an outside vendor for the performance of the test. Results are sent directly from the vendor to the designated Health Program representative for review. Ultimate decisions regarding matriculation of an accepted applicant or continuation of a current student whose criminal background check reveals information of concern will be made by the Campbell University Interprofessional Education (IPE) Experiential Subcommittee. No information derived from a criminal background check will automatically disqualify any accepted applicant from matriculation or prevent progression of a current student. A final decision about matriculation or continuation in a health program will be made only after a careful review of factors including: the nature, circumstances and frequency of any offenses, length of time since the offenses, documented successful rehabilitation and the accuracy of the information provided by the applicant in his or her application materials. Information from these reports that is unrelated to decisions about admissions and continued enrollment will be maintained in the campbell.edu/cphs | 7 Office of the Dean and will not become part of the student's permanent file. Information obtained will only be used in accordance with state and federal laws. Due to the potential impact of clinical placements, enrolled students or those currently granted a deferral or alternate course of study are required to self-report any new charges or convictions to the designated program representative within three (3 )days. For current students, failure to disclose new criminal charges within three (3) days to the designated program representative may result in program specific action and /or referral to the Student Affairs and Professionalism Committee. All criminal background data will be maintained in a secure location to assure confidentiality. Routine access to the information will be limited to staff members in the office of Admissions & Students Affairs, the associate dean of admissions & student affairs, and directors/ coordinators of experiential education in each health program. Substance Abuse Screening Protocol The College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences requires substance abuse screening tests (SASTs) of all nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy and physician assistant program applicants who earn acceptance into their respective health programs prior to matriculation. Current nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy and physician assistant students will also be required to have a SAST annually or as often as required by experiential sites in addition to random or just cause SASTs. Students enrolled in the BS in clinical research and BS in pharmaceutical Sciences programs may be required to have a SAST in the semester of the B-2 year, prior to matriculating into the mandatory B-2 internship and may be required to submit to random or just cause SASTs. Currently, applicants and students enrolled in the MS in Clinical Research, MS in Pharmaceutical Sciences and MS in Public Health degree programs are not required to complete SASTs. Applicants to a CPHS professional program will be notified of the background check and substance abuse screening protocol requirement as part of the matriculation process. Additional screening tests may be required as determined by CPHS or the clinical training sites. Health care facilities providing student internships and clinical experiences for Campbell CPHS health programs and members of the CPHS admissions office and/ or Interprofessional Education Experiential Subcommittee have the right to review all SAST results. It is extremely important to note an understand that the affiliate rotation/ internship/clinical/experiential sites, not CPHS, ultimately have the ability to accept or deny the placement of any student based upon the SAST results even after acceptance into the program. CPHS reserves the right to require drug or alcohol testing on any currently enrolled CPHS student (BS, MS or doctoral) when based on unusual or erratic behavior or performance reasonable suspicion exists that a student is under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Examples of reasonable suspicions include but are not limited to: a formal or public complaint issued by students, faculty, or staff, and/or physical proof. Refusal or failure to submit to screening may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. Students found to have screening tests positive for alcohol, illicit substances or prescription medications without a valid prescription may result in referral to the Student Conduct & Professionalism Committee and/or disciplinary action up to and including dismissal as warranted by CPHS administration. Educational training sites may require CPHS to provide them with a copy of the results of any substance of abuse tests performed on students prior to and for the duration of their placement at the site. Clinical education sites may set their own standards in regard to who they will admit based on the results of the substance abuse screening or require further screening. Students who are not willing to allow the release of the required personal information will not be able to be placed at an affiliated clinical education site, and thus cannot meet the requirements to continue their education and fulfill the curriculum requirements for graduation. A positive drug/alcohol screen may require the student to be evaluated and receive counseling. In this case, the student may be seen by the Director of Behavioral Health at Campbell University, or they can opt to be seen at a community behavioral health agency/ practice. Should the student opt to use a behavioral health center other than Campbell, the student will be responsible for the cost. All students will be responsible for ensuring that documentation is provided to the school regarding attendance at a behavioral health center. Procedure The currently approved urine substance abuse screening test will be completed at a designated lab facility on all accepted applicants prior to matriculation and current health programs' students annually with results sent directly to the current Campbell University vendor. The letter sent by the program to each accepted applicant, as well as to selected wait- listed applicants will include information about these requirements with the contingency that the final decision regarding matriculation will be made after institutional review of the accepted applicant's SAST report. Appropriate authorization, with pertinent identifying information necessary to initiate the test, will be received from each accepted applicant and current student prior to initiating a SAST. Accepted and current students must have the sample collected at a CPHS approved collection site. CPHS contracts with an outside vendor for the performance of the test. Such tests will be conducted in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other applicable laws. Results are sent directly from the vendor to the designated Health Program representative for review. Applicants and current students without any abnormal SAST findings can be approved by the Admissions Department or program representative for matriculation or continuation in their respective program. Applicants & current students with abnormal SAST findings, other than a \"negative dilute,\" must undergo further review by the Campbell University Interprofessional Education Experiential Subcommittee. Applicants/current students with SAST positive results for illegal substances or non- prescribed controlled medications will be referred to the Interprofessional Education Experiential Subcommittee with the potential for their offer of admission to be rescinded or dismissal from their current program, depending on the status of the student. Applicants/current students with a SAST result of \"negative dilute\", MUST repeat the SAST at their expense. A second negative dilute result may jeopardize a student's admission or ability to continue studies in the progression of his/her respective program. Although we acknowledge that marijuana use is legal in several states, marijuana is a Schedule I drug and it is currently considered ILLEGAL by the federal government and by the state of North Carolina; therefore, applicants/ current students will be held to this standard set by our federal and state government. The possession and/or consumption of marijuana may jeopardize an applicant's/student's ability to matriculate and progress through the CPHS degree programs. GENERAL INFORMATION8 | 2016-2017 Academic Bulletin8 | 2016-2017 Academic BulletinDress Code Proper professional attire signals to patients and other health professionals a student's self- confidence, knowledge level, and willingness to participate in responsible decision making processes. The short-length white lab coat is required for many health care professionals in training. Business casual attire is appropriate for classroom and examination sessions. Business casual attire for men includes collared shirts and khaki or dress slacks*; for women knee- length skirts or dress slacks with tailored blouses (DPT-no bare shoulders). Closed toe shoes are required for all clinical experiences. The following dress and accessories are unacceptable in the clinic and classroom: hats, caps, t-shirts, men's sleeveless shirts, blue jeans, shorts, mini-skirts, visible cleavage, sweat pants, athletic attire, tank tops, bare midriffs, skintight clothing, flip flops, and visible tattoos or any body piercing (other than earrings). Special jeans days may be granted through the appropriate program supervisor. For laboratory training, the dress code is listed below for individual programs. It is understood that laboratory experiences may include time in the classroom; therefore, the proper attire for classroom instruction on laboratory days is at the discretion of the professor. For clinical/experiential training, the dress code will be dictated by company policy. *Men in the PA Program are required to wear a shirt and tie in business casual settings. **DPT program students are to wear appropriate laboratory clothing under scrubs (solid color) on laboratory session days. In the following circumstances, students are to abide by the dress code above (non-laboratory days, outside classroom activity, practical exams, and OSCE). Doctor of Physical Therapy Laboratory Dress Code Laboratory clothing typically needs to allow access for easy manipulation and palpation of body parts. Therefore, wearing shorts, t-shirts, and sports bras or similar is appropriate. The following items are never appropriate in any setting: Bikini/speedo Clothing that exposes breasts Pants below hips that expose undergarments Any clothing that allows for viewing of undergarments while performing job duties or classroom activities Pajamas and slippers Master of Physician Assistant Practice Laboratory Dress Code Clean scrubs are recommended for laboratory sessions. A short white lab coat and name tag are required for all clinical encounters; long hair must be pulled back. Nose, lip, and eyebrow piercings are not permitted in clinical settings. Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing Clinical Experience Dress Code While involved in clinical experiences (agency, skill, or simulation lab), the following guidelines provide the student with behavioral expectations. The Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing uniform and lab coat are to be worn for any clinical activity. Students may be required to change into hospital scrubs upon arrival to the clinical setting. In this event, the undergraduate uniform is worn to and from the agency. Shoes must be low heeled and black. For safety, footwear must be non-canvas with an enclosed toe and heel. The shoes can be any style black (professional or athletic) and worn exclusively in the clinical setting. The appropriate picture ID is visible at all times. Hair must be clean and groomed. For men, well maintained facial hair is the expectation. All students with longer hair must be off the face and pulled back into a ponytail. Nails must be short and clean to prevent injury to patients. Artificial nails are not allowed. Students must adhere to the prevailing clinical facility policies regarding jewelry. In general, a watch, flat wedding band, and single stud earrings are appropriate. Visible body piercing including tongue stud/ring, clear nasal stud, or brow jewelry is to be removed prior to patient care and not worn while in uniform. It is not acceptable to cover these areas with flesh-colored materials. Gum or tobacco products are not allowed in any professional care setting. A tattoo must be covered during a clinical experience. Fragrances are not permitted. Environmental Health and Safety The College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences has the Environmental Health and Safety Committee that is responsible for updating and maintaining the laboratory safety manual to include policy & procedure, safety, training, storage, and disposal of hazardous chemicals. The Lab Safety Manual can be accessed in each program manager's office. Emergency contact numbers are posted in the administrative offices through the College. Training is supplied and recorded (kept in secure file cabinet in program directors' offices) for all faculty, students, and staff who participate in scholarship activities involving hazardous chemicals in laboratories. Grade Appeals Students with a just reason for appealing a grade in a course at CPHS must first appeal to the course instructor. If the issue cannot be adequately resolved with the instructor, then the student should appeal to the course director. If no resolution is achieved at the course level, the student should appeal to the appropriate program director or program chair. After unsuccessful efforts within the department, a student may appeal to the appropriate Academic Performance and Standards Committee to seek resolution. If the student feels that the resolution is not just, the student must submit a written petition to the associate dean for academic affairs within seven days of the student's receipt of notification of the Academic Performance and Standards Committee decision. The petition must contain the specific variance requested and a description of any extenuating circumstances intended to justify granting the variance. The decision of the associate dean for academic affairs is final. Grade Reports, Records, and Transcripts A report of grades attained by a student in the CPHS will be available through the University's WebAccess system at the end of each semester. The official records of each student in CPHS will be maintained securely in the Office of the Registrar. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (PL93-380) will govern the release of information for this record which contains the transcript from Campbell University, transcripts and transcript evaluations from other educational agencies attended by the student, secondary school transcripts, scholastic aptitude, GRE, and other standardized test scores. The application for admission, general correspondence with the student and, if applicable, letters concerning misconduct or disciplinary actions at Campbell University are maintained by the Office of Admissions & Student Affairs within the university archival system. The transcript and contents of the permanent record may be examined by the student upon appointment with the Registrar, or the associate dean for student affairs. Repeat Courses campbell.edu/cphs | 9 campbell.edu/cphs | 9 GENERAL INFORMATIONFor repeat courses, the last attempt only will affect the final grade point average. Previous hours attempted, previous hours passed, and previous quality points will not be considered, although they will remain on the permanent record. All grades from all attempts are recorded and remain on the transcript permanently. Health Insurance Due to contractual requirements enumerated in agreements with clinical experiential training sites, all CPHS students enrolled in the nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy and physician assistant programs are required to have health insurance coverage. Before registration, students must either provide proof of health insurance or purchase the health insurance available through the University. Students may also be required to upload the necessary supporting documentation verifying active health insurance coverage into the electronic management systems utilized by their respective program in order to track all experiential training requirements. Any medical costs incurred by students as a result of injury, exposure to infectious diseases or materials, while in training, are the responsibility of the student and his or her health insurance carrier. Events covered under the Accidental Insurance Policy are covered in a future section. Immunization During introductory and advanced experiential experiences and clinical rotations, students will be involved in direct patient care and therefore at risk for potential exposure to infectious materials and patients. All students must provide a completed medical history form and proof of immunization as directed by their respective program. Students are responsible for maintaining immunizations; this is required by CPHS in order to complete all required supervised clinical practice experiences. Prior to registration, students must provide proof of the immunizations/immunity requirements listed below. Requirements Tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis: Td booster within the past 10 years. Students must have a one-time dose of Tdap unless contraindicated. Students must have booster protection across all years enrolled in the program (i.e. lapses in coverage between boosters are unacceptable). Polio: Complete IPV or OPV series MMR: Two doses or laboratory evidence of immunity to each of the three diseases Hepatitis A*: Two-vaccination series required before the end of the first professional year. The first dose must be completed prior to matriculation and students must provide documentation of the all doses. Hepatitis B: Students must show documentation of a three-dose series with the first of the three doses upon admission to CPHS. Before the end of the first professional year, students must provide documentation of all doses in the series. Varicella (chicken pox): Students must either receive the two-series Varicella vaccination or prove immunity to the Varicella virus by a positive (+) blood titer. Individuals utilizing blood titer as proof must submit a copy of the actual lab result. History of \"chicken pox\" in your medical record is not sufficient. Tuberculin (PPD) skin test: Annually (some rotation sites require a 2-step PPD - CPHS will let the student know if this applies.) If the TB skin test is positive, a chest X-ray is required. Influenza: Annual flu vaccine is required. *Not required for Physical Therapy coursework Standard Precautions The Center of Disease Control (CDC) has developed a list of the following precautions to prevent accidental spread of infectious diseases to both students and patients: Hand washing (or using an antiseptic hand rub) After touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, and contaminated items Immediately after removing gloves between patient contact Gloves For contact with blood, body fluids, secretions, and contaminated items For contact with mucous membranes and non-intact skin Masks, goggles, face masks Protect mucous membranes of eyes, nose, and mouth when contact with blood and body fluids is likely Gowns Protect skin from blood or body fluid contact Prevent soiling of clothing during procedures that may involve contact with blood or body fluids Linen Handle soiled linen to prevent touching skin or mucous membranes Do not pre-rinse soiled linens in patient care areas Patient care equipment Handle soiled equipment in a manner to prevent contact with skin or mucous membranes to prevent contamination of clothing or the environment Clean reusable equipment prior to reuse Environmental cleaning Routinely care, clean, and disinfect equipment and furnishings in patient care areas Sharps Avoid recapping used needles, use self-capping safety needles if available Avoid removing used needles from disposable syringes Avoid bending, breaking, or manipulating used needles by hand Place used sharps in puncture- resistant containers Patient resuscitation Use mouthpieces, resuscitation bags, or other ventilation devices to avoid mouth to mouth resuscitation Patient placement Place patients who contaminate the environment or cannot maintain appropriate hygiene in private rooms OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Training CPHS requires that all students who have contact with patients view the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens (BBP) training video. Copies of student training records will be kept in the office of each respective professional program. Physician Assistant Students Only- Tuberculosis Training Physician assistant students will receive training for preventing the transmission of tuberculosis (TB) annually. All students who have the potential for exposure to TB may be fit tested for National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) certified personal respirator protective devices, as required by clinical sites. These devices are considered personal protective equipment and must be purchased by the student. Personal Illness Students presenting signs or symptoms of infectious or communicable diseases have a duty not to spread illness to others. Students should consult Student Health Services (910- 893-1516), their preceptor, clinical supervisor or the infection control office at the clinical site about the advisability of working with patients and when it is safe to return to patient care.10 | 2016-2017 Academic BulletinIncident Reporting Body Fluid and Needle Stick Policy and Procedure Incidents involving needle sticks and exposure to body fluids or potential bloodborne pathogens require immediate action to protect students' health and safety. If a student sustains a needle stick or is exposed to infectious materials he or she should: 1. Immediately wash exposure site thoroughly with soap and water (or water only for mucous membranes) Wash needle stick and cuts with soap and water Flush the nose, mouth or skin with water Irrigate eyes with clean water, saline or sterile irrigants 2. Notify the preceptor or clinical supervisor at the rotation site for assistance For pharmacy students the preceptor should notify the Office of Experiential Education by phone, 800-760-9697, or email (Jean White ext. 1709/email: whitej@campbell.edu or Paige Brown ext. 5611/ email brownp@campbell.edu) as soon as reasonably possible to begin the process of filing an incident report. For physician assistant students the preceptor should notify the PA clinical coordinator by phone, 910-893-1252 or email, gerstnerl@campbell.edu, or the PA department's office, 910-893-1210, as soon as reasonably possible to begin the process of filing an incident report. 3. Seek immediate care for necessary lab work and post-exposure prophylaxis In the event that the rotation site has an existing exposure policy, the student should comply with the site's policy. If the rotation site is not able to assist the student, the student should seek care at the nearest available facility to provide appropriate care (initial lab work for HIV, HBV, HCV and risk assessment to determine the need for chemoprophylaxis, etc.) or students may be seen at Campbell University's Student Health Service. 4. The preceptor or appropriate institutional representative should obtain consent from the source patient for appropriate laboratory testing (i.e. HIV, HBV, and HCV status). Students should receive post- exposure prophylaxis within hours of the exposure rather than days, per CDC recommendations, if the status of the source patient is deemed high risk or if there is uncertainty of the source patient's status. 5. Some clinical sites will provide post- exposure care to students at no charge. When this is not the case, needle sticks and other exposure are covered under the Campbell University Student Accident Insurance Policy. Accidental infectious exposure must be reported as directed in this policy: BMI Benefits, LLC PO Box 511 76 Main 077447 Phone: 800-445-3126 Fax: 732-583-9610 presenting to a clinic for post-exposure care, the student may provide the above policy information and his or her student ID card. However, the site may or may not accept direct payment through this plan. Students may have to pay out of pocket at the time of service. However, reimbursement for services up to $5,000 per incident can be filed via Student Health Services. Students will need: To provide an itemized statement complete with diagnosis and procedure codes Complete a claim form either in person, or call Student Health Services at 910- 893-1560. The staff will be glad to help you fill out the form by email correspondence. Student Health Services personnel will provide further instruction on how to complete and file your claim. If requested, mail documents to: Campbell University Student Health Service PO Box 565 Buies Creek, NC 27506 Students may opt to use their personal health insurance to cover the cost of post-exposure care in lieu of using the Campbell University Student Accident Insurance Policy. 6. Although, the preceptor or clinical supervisor may have contacted CPHS as indicated above, the student must also contact the Office of Experiential Education or the Physician Assistant Department Office as soon as reasonably possible but within a minimum of 72 hours of the exposure to finalize the incident report. The incident report shall contain: The date and time of exposure Clinical site, location and unit information Details of how the exposure occurred Details of the type and severity of the exposure Details about the source patient (i.e. post-exposure management, previous vaccinations, current HIV, HBV, HCV status) The Office Experiential Education or the Physician Assistant Department Office will provide a copy of the incident report to Student Health Services. This will alert the Student Health Services in the event that an accident insurance claim needs to be filled. In the event that an incident report was filed at the rotation site, a copy of this must be sent to the Office of Experiential Education or the Physician Assistant Department Office to be maintained in the student's file. 7. In the event of an exposure, the National Clinician's Post Exposure Prophylaxis Hotline is available by phone, 888-448- 4911, 24 hours per day, seven days per week, to provide guidance in managing exposures. Inclement Weather During periods of inclement weather, classes at CPHS will meet according to the decisions made by the University. Students may monitor decisions made through the University's inclement weather website, www.campbell. edu/weather. Students are encouraged to use their own good judgment relative to safety in traveling to campus. Should classes meet and students who commute are unable to travel safely to the campus, they will not be penalized and will be able to make-up missed work. Meal Plan Non-residential students have the option to purchase a declining balance meal plan. Students pay for the plan in advance at the Campbell University Business Office to have funds placed on their declining balance account. This account may be used at Marshbanks Dining Hall, Shouse Dining Hall, Oasis Grill, Chick-fil-A, Moe's Southwest Grill, Papa Johns, Jole Mole, Starbucks, and the Groc. Students residing on campus campbell.edu/cphs | 11 The Business Office is responsible for the reassessment of student account charges; however, it is the responsibility of the Financial Aid Office to ensure financial aid awards have been evaluated and reassessed accordingly. The Business Office reserves the right to hold refund of credit balances until the Financial Aid Office has evaluated and approved the release of funds awarded to students that withdraw from the University. Master of Science in Clinical Research Online Refund Policy In the event of a student's complete withdrawal from the university for a particular enrollment period, refunds/repayments are calculated according to the Higher Education Act and its subsequent modifications. Campbell University will comply fully with federal regulations as required. This method will be used to determine refunds/repayments for Title IV aid as well as state and institutional aid. This includes students who do not follow the university's policy for official withdrawal. Students requesting a leave of absence greater than two 8 week terms must notify department chairman in writing. The chairman will evaluate requests on an individual basis and determine the length of the granted leave of absence, not to exceed five 8 week terms.

Notice of Non-Discrimination; Complaints Concerning Discrimination, Hostile Environment, and/or Sexual Harassment under Title IX. Campbell University is committed to equality of educational opportunity. Campbell University does not permit discrimination or harassment in our programs and activities on the basis of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, ethnicity or national origin, religion, disability, genetic information, protected veteran status and any other characteristic protected by law, except where appropriate and authorized by law. The University maintains and Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action program for its recruitment, employment, promotion, compensation, grants of leave, and benefits of employees. For more information go to: http://www.campbell.edu/about/ employment/ Campbell University is committed to providing a safe and non-discriminatory learning, living, and working environment for all members of the University community. The University does not discriminate on the basis of sex or gender in any of its education or employment programs and activities. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in the University's programs and activities. The University will respond to complaints or reports about prohibited conduct with measures designed to stop the behavior, eliminate any such discrimination, prevent the recurrence of the prohibited conduct, and remediate any adverse effects of such conduct on campus or in University-related programs or activities. This may include the implementation of interim restriction(s). The University has an obligation to make reasonable efforts to investigate and address complaints or reports of sex discrimination, including but not limited to, sexual violence, sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, dating/domestic violence, retaliation, and other related forms of sex discrimination or sexual misconduct, whenever it becomes aware of such a complaint or report. Collectively, these terms are referred to in this policy as \"Sexual Misconduct.\" Once made aware, the University must conduct an GENERAL INFORMATION12 | 2016-2017 Academic Bulletininvestigation regardless of how the information was brought to the University's attention or the extent to which the Complainant wishes to participate or be involved. This policy refers to the individual who is the alleged victim of the behavior(s) in question as the \"Complainant\" and the alleged to have committed the violation of the policy as the \"Respondent.\" Students who believe they have been subjected to discrimination or harassment in violation of Title IX should follow the procedures outlined in this policy to report these concerns immediately to the Title IX Coordinator identified below. Title IX prohibits retaliation by any student and/or employee against anyone who reports an alleged Title IX violation. Inquiries, regarding the application of Title IX and other laws, regulations and policies prohibiting discrimination may be directed to Mrs. Kellie Nothstine, Title IX Coordinator, P .O. Box 95 (Wallace Student Center, Room 237), Buies Creek, NC, 27506, 910-893-2039 / FAX 910-893-1534; nothstine@campbell. Ms. Malinda Ashcraft, Deputy Title IX Coordinator, ashcraft@campbell.edu. Inquiries may also be directed to the United States Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, District of Columbia Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W. Washington, DC 20202-1475. Telephone :( 202)453-6020; Facsimile :( 202)453-6021; Email: OCR.DC@ed.gov This Title IX policy governs the conduct of Campbell University students, regardless of enrollment status; faculty; staff; and third parties (i.e., non-members of the University community, such as vendors, alumni/ae, visitors, or local residents). This Title IX policy applies to all University programs and activities. All campus community members are responsible for their actions and behavior, whether the conduct in question occurs on campus or in another location. Members of the campus community have a responsibility to adhere to University policies and local, state and federal law. As a result, this policy applies both to on-campus and off-campus conduct. In particular, off-campus behaviors that have an actual or potential adverse impact on any member of the campus community or the University fall under this policy. Although there is no geographic limitation to invoking this policy, sexual misconduct that is alleged to have occurred at a significant distance from the University may be more difficult to investigate. Third parties are both protected by and subject to this policy. A third party may report or file a complaint concerning a violation of this policy committed by a member of the University community. A third party may also be permanently barred from the University or subject to other restrictions for failing to comply with this policy. This policy applies to conduct that occurs on University property, and in certain circumstances, off University property (i.e., off campus). This policy applies to conduct that occurs off campus when the conduct is associated with a University- sponsored program or activity, such as travel, research, or internship programs; when it utilizes University owned or provided technology resources; or when such conduct may have a nexus to campus, such as a continuing adverse effect or creation of a hostile environment on campus. Judgments about these matters will depend upon the facts of an individual case. B. Campus Life Policies and Practices Campbell University prohibits the crimes of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking as later defined herein. Campbell University is fortunate to have a very safe campus. Nevertheless, the possibility of rape, date rape, and sexual assault exists, just as it exists on any campus. The University's approach to addressing this problem is to (a) educate the campus community as a means of prevention; (b) deter such acts through prompt reporting and investigation of alleged violations of this policy, and the imposition of sanctions where a violation is found by a preponderance of the evidence; (c) provide assistance to Complainants; and (d) place Complainants in contact with local law enforcement to investigate possible legal prosecution. Educational programs are conducted through several offices. The Campus Life Office addresses rape, date rape and sexual assault at residence hall programs. Student Support Services provides video lectures, seminars, literature, video and audiotapes, and personal counseling. Additionally, Campus Safety provides informative materials and presentations to campus organizations and residence halls. Counseling options are listed in this publication in the Campus Services section. If a student, staff or faculty member believes someone they know has experienced sexual misconduct, they should promptly report incidents to the Title IX Coordinator: Mrs. Kellie Nothstine, Title IX Coordinator, P .O. Box 95 (Wallace Student Center, Room 237), Buies Creek, NC, 27506, 910-893-2039 / FAX 910-893-1534; nothstine@campbell. edu. All faculty and staff (including all Resident Assistants, Resident Directors, and Resident Chaplains) who observe or aware of sexual misconduct are required to immediately report to the Title IX Coordinator. The faculty or staff member should not investigate or try and resolve or mediate the situation. Campbell University encourages the reporting of possible violations of Title IX policy by those subject to the violation or witnesses. Sometimes students are reluctant to make such reports or participate in a grievance proceeding because they themselves may be accused of a conduct violation, such as drinking. However, it is in the best interests for those subject to sexual misconduct or witnesses of possible violations to report to the Title IX Coordinator. Thus, a student who reports sexual misconduct by another will not be subject to conduct violations or disciplinary proceedings for her/his own personal consumption or possession of alcohol at or near the time of the incident, provided that the reporting student's actions did not place the health or safety of any other person at risk or violate additional University policies. Only those who are subject to the violation or a witness may receive amnesty, not the alleged Respondent. C. Definitions Awareness Programs: Community-wide or audience-specific programming, initiatives, and strategies that increase audience knowledge and share information and resources to prevent violence, promote safety, and reduce perpetration. Bystander intervention: Safe and positive options that may be carried out by an individual or individuals to prevent harm or intervene when there is a risk of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Bystander intervention includes recognizing situations of potential harm, understanding institutional structures and cultural conditions that facilitate violence, overcoming barriers to intervening, identifying safe and effective intervention options, and taking action to intervene. Bystanders may report possible misconduct and all faculty and staff (including all Resident Assistants, Resident Directors, and Resident Chaplains) who observe or aware of sexual misconduct are required to immediately report to the Title IX Coordinator. Complainant: The individual who has experienced alleged sexual misconduct. Consent: The explicit approval and permission to engage in sexual activity demonstrated by clear actions, words, or writings. Consent is informed, freely given and mutually understood by all parties involved. If coercion, intimidation, threats, campbell.edu/cphs | 13 GENERAL INFORMATIONand/or physical force are used, there is no consent. If the Complainant was mentally or physically incapacitated or impaired so that the Complainant could not understand the fact, nature, or extent of the sexual situation, there is no consent; this includes conditions due to alcohol or drug consumption, or being asleep or unconscious, or under the age of legal consent, or unable to give consent under current law. Silence does not necessarily constitute consent, and past consent of sexual activities does not imply ongoing future consent. Whether the Respondent has taken advantage of a position of influence over the Complainant may be a factor in determining whether consent was freely given. Consent to some form of sexual activity cannot be automatically taken as consent to any other form of sexual activity. Consent can be withdrawn at any time. Dating Violence: Violence that is committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the Complainant. The existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on the reporting party's statement and with consideration of the length of the relationship, the type of relationship, and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship. For the purposes of this definition\u2014 Dating violence includes, but is not limited to, sexual or physical abuse or the threat of such abuse. Dating violence does not include acts covered under the definition of domestic violence. Domestic violence: A felony or misdemeanor crime of violence committed- By a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the Complainant; By a person with whom the Complainant shares a child in common; By a person who is cohabitating with, or has cohabitated with, the Complainant as a spouse or intimate partner; By a person similarly situated to a spouse of the Complainant under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the crime of violence occurred, or By any other person against an adult or youth Complainant who is protected from that person's acts under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the crime of violence occurred. Discrimination: Any distinction, preference, advantage for or detriment to an individual compared to others that is based upon an individual's actual or perceived race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, ethnicity or national origin, religion, disability, genetic information, protected veteran status and any other characteristic protected by law. Discriminatory Harassment: Detrimental action based on an individual's actual or perceived race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, ethnicity or national origin, religion, disability, genetic information, protected veteran status and any other characteristic protected by law that is so severe, persistent or pervasive that it unreasonably interferes with or limits a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the university's educational program or activities. Gender-based Harassment. This is another form of sex-based harassment and refers to unwelcome conduct based on an individual's actual or perceived sex, including harassment based on gender identity or nonconformity with sex stereotypes, and not necessarily involving conduct of a sexual nature Hostile Environment. Harassing that was conduct sufficiently serious-that is sufficiently severe or pervasive-to deny or limit a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the university's program based on sex. Ongoing Prevention and Awareness Campaigns: Programming, initiatives, and strategies that are sustained over time and focus on increasing understanding of topics relevant to and skills for addressing dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking, using a range of strategies with audiences throughout the institution and including information described in paragraph 34 CFR 668.46, paragraph (j)(1)(i) (A)-(F). Pregnant and Parenting Students. The university may not (a) apply any rule concerning parental, family, or marital status that treats persons differently on the basis of sex; (b) discriminate against or exclude any student from its education program or activity, including any class or extracurricular activity on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom; or (c) make pre-admission inquiries as to the marital status of an applicant for admission. Primary prevention programs: Programming, initiatives, and strategies informed by research or assessed for value, effectiveness, or outcome that are intended to stop dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking before they occur through the promotion of positive and healthy behaviors that foster healthy, mutually respectful relationships and sexuality, encourage safe bystander intervention, and seek to change behavior and social norms in healthy and safe directions. Proceeding: All activities related to a non-criminal resolution of an institutional disciplinary complaint, including, but not limited to, fact finding investigations, formal or informal meetings, and hearings. Proceeding does not include communications and meetings between officials and the Complainants concerning accommodations or protective measures to be provided to the Complainants. Rape: The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by the sex organ of another person, without the consent of the Complainant. Respondent: The individual who has been accused of committing sexual misconduct. Result: Any initial, interim, and final decision by any official or entity authorized to resolve disciplinary matters within the institution. The result must include any sanctions assigned by the institution. Notwithstanding section 444 of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232g), commonly referred to as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the result must also include the rationale for the result and the sanctions. Retaliatory Harassment: Intentional action taken by an accused individual, allied third party, or the Title IX Coordinator, absent legitimate non-discriminatory purposes, that harms an individual as reprisal for filing or participating in a proceeding under this policy or any other grievance or disciplinary proceeding, or advocating for others' Title IX rights. Any such action is strictly prohibited and may be investigated and reviewed as a separate violation of these Title IX Policies and Procedures. Risk Reduction: Options designed to decrease perpetration and bystander inaction, and to increase empowerment for the Complainant in order to promote safety and to help individuals and communities address conditions that facilitate violence. Sex Offenses: Any sexual act directed against another person, without consent of the Complainant including instances where the Complainant is incapable of giving consent. Rape - the carnal knowledge of a person, forcibly and/or against the person's will; or not forcibly or against the person's will where the Complainant is incapable of giving consent because of his/her temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity (or because of his/her youth). Sodomy - oral or anal sexual intercourse with another person, forcibly and/or against the person's will; or not forcibly or against the person's will where the Complainant is incapable of giving consent because of his/her temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.14 | 2016-2017 Academic Bulletin Sexual Assault with an Object - the use of an object or instrument to unlawfully penetrate, however slightly, the genital or anal opening of the body of another person, forcibly and/or against that person's will; or not forcibly or against the person's will where the Complainant is incapable of giving consent because of his/her temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity (or because of his/her youth). Forcible Fondling - the touching of private body parts of another person for sexual gratification, forcibly and/or against that person's will; or not forcibly or against the person's will where the Complainant is incapable of giving consent because of his/her temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity (or because of his/her youth).

Sexual Harassment: Any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature and can include unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature, such as assault or acts of sexual violence. Examples of sexually harassing conduct include, but are not limited to: making sexual propositions or pressuring students for sexual favors; touching of a sexual nature; writing graffiti of a sexual nature; making via electronic means, displaying, or distributing sexually explicit drawings, videos, pictures, or written materials, in any manner or through social media; performing sexual gestures or touching oneself sexually in front of others; telling sexual or dirty jokes; spreading sexual rumors or rating other students as to sexual activity or performance; or circulating or showing e-mails or Web sites of a sexual nature. Sexual Harassment of a Student by another Student. Any unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature by a student toward another student that is so severe, persistent or pervasive that it unreasonably interferes with or limits a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the university's educational program or activities.Sexual Harassment of a Student by a Faculty/Staff Member. Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature by a faculty or staff member toward a student are held to constitute sexual harassment when: Submission to such sexual conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of rating an individual's educational development or performance; or Such conduct is so severe, persistent or pervasive that it unreasonably interferes with or limits a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the university's educational program or activities. Sexual Violence. Sexual violence is a form of sexual harassment and refers to physical sexual acts perpetrated against a person's will or where a person is incapable of giving consent (e.g., due to the student's age or use of drugs or alcohol, or because an intellectual or other disability prevents the student from having the capacity to give consent). A number of different acts fall into the category of sexual violence, including rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual abuse, and sexual coercion. Stalking: Engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to Far of the person's safety or the safety of others; or Suffer substantial emotional distress For the purposes of this definition- Course of conduct means two or more acts including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties, by any action, method, device, or means, follows, monitors, observes, surveys, threatens, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with a person's property. Reasonable person means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and with similar identities to the Complainant. While a particular interaction must be offensive to both a reasonable person and to the Complainant to be defined as harassment, faculty and staff members and other persons of authority should be sensitive to questions about mutuality of consent that may be raised and to the conflict of interests that are inherent in personal relationships that result from professional and educational interactions. Harassment is particularly damaging when it exploits the educational dependence and trust between students and faculty/staff. When the authority and power inherent in faculty/staff relationships with students, whether overtly, implicitly, or through misinterpretation, is abused in any way, there is potentially great damage to the individual student, to the accused individual, and to the climate of the institution. D. Procedures When a complaint is filed alleging discrimination or harassment in violation of Title IX as defined herein, or such alleged conduct is brought to the attention of the Title IX Coordinator, the process involves an immediate initial inquiry by the Title IX Coordinator to determine if there is reasonable cause to believe the discrimination or harassment has occurred. If the Title IX Coordinator determines there is reasonable cause to believe the discrimination or harassment as alleged has occurred, the Title IX Coordinator will initiate a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation. This investigation is designed to provide a fair and reliable determination about whether the discrimination or harassment has occurred. If so, the university will implement a prompt and effective remedy designed to end the discriminating or harassing conduct, prevent its recurrence and address its effects. If deemed necessary by the Title IX Coordinator, interim remedial measures to avoid contact between the Complainant and the alleged perpetrator (the \"Respondent\") may be taken prior to completion of the investigation to change academic and extracurricular activities including living, transportation, dining, and working situations. The Complainant will be referred to the Office of Student Life to make him/her aware of all available resources such as victim advocacy, housing assistance, academic support, counseling, disability services, and health and mental health services, and the right to report a crime to Campus Safety or the Harnett County Sheriff's Department. This procedure is intended to apply to alleged discrimination or harassment in violation of this Title IX Policy. All other misconduct or grievances by students against students or employees against students will be addressed through the student academic/ misconduct procedures or non-academic/ non-misconduct grievance procedures located elsewhere in this Code which is administered by the Vice President for Student Life. 1. Informal Process Before pursuing the formal complaint process, every reasonable effort should be made to constructively resolve the issues. Whenever possible and safe, the problem or complaint should first be discussed with the Respondent who is the subject of the complaint. If the parties believe the issue campbell.edu/cphs | 15 has been resolved, they should nevertheless report the matter to the Title IX Coordinator for approval of the resolution. If satisfactory resolution is not reached after discussion with the Respondent, the Complainant should contact the Title IX Coordinator immediately regardless of whether the Respondent is a student or an employee. The university does not require a student to contact the Respondent or the Respondent's supervisor if doing so is impracticable or unsafe, or if the student believes that the conduct cannot be effectively addressed through informal means. 2. Formal Process If the informal process does not resolve the complaint, the Title IX Coordinator or a case investigator (either the \"Investigator\") will be designated to formally investigate the complaint. The Investigator will be someone who is regularly trained on dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, and how to conduct an investigation and hearing process that protects the safety of the Complainant and promotes accountability. Notice of a formal student complaint can be made in person or orally to an appropriate official, but the university strongly encourages submission of the complaint in writing, by email attachment as a MS Word or pdf document, or other written form to the Title IX Coordinator identified above The Complainant should clearly and concisely describe the alleged incident(s), when and where it occurred, and the desired remedy sought. The complaint should be signed by the Complainant or, in the case of an email submission, sent as an email attachment, in letter format and should contain the name and all contact information for the Complainant. Any supporting documentation and evidence should be referenced within the body of the complaint. Additionally, the Complainant should submit any supporting materials in writing as quickly as is practicable. Upon receipt of a complaint, the Investigator will direct the investigation and confer with the Title IX Coordinator and the Vice President for Student Life on interim action, accommodations for the alleged Complainant, or other necessary remedial short-term actions. The Investigator will then take the following steps: In coordination with the campus Title IX Coordinator, initiate any necessary remedial actions to include preventing any contact between the Complainant and the alleged violator if necessary; Determine the identity and contact information of the Complainant (whether that be the initiator, the alleged Complainant, or a University proxy or representative); Identify the correct policies allegedly violated; Conduct an immediate initial investigation to determine if there is reasonable cause to charge the Respondent , and what policy violations should be alleged as part of the complaint; If there is insufficient evidence to support reasonable cause, the complaint should be closed with no further action; Meet with the Complainant to finalize the complaint; Prepare the notice of charges on the basis of the initial investigation; Commence a thorough, reliable and impartial investigation by developing a strategic investigation plan, including a witness list, evidence list, intended timeframe, and order of interviews for all witnesses and the accused individual, who may be given notice prior to or at the time of the interview; Complete the investigation promptly, and without unreasonable deviation from the intended timeline; Have both the Complainant and the Respondent review their statements made to the Investigator and sign off on them either in person or electronically as their full and complete statement; Make a finding, based on a preponderance of the evidence (whether a policy violation is more likely than not), which may include a recommended sanction; The decision of the Title IX Coordinator is final, and not subject to modification except through the appeals process set forth in Section 3. Present the findings (but not the recommended sanction) to the Respondent, who may accept the findings, accept the findings in part and reject them in part, or may reject all findings; and Simultaneously share the findings and update the Complainant on the status of the investigation and the outcome. Either party may appeal the findings pursuant to Section 3. These procedures are entirely administrative in nature and are not considered legal proceedings. During the meeting with the Investigator or any subsequent proceedings, the Complainant or the Respondent may have an advisor or advocate accompany and assist him/her at their expense. This advisor can be anyone. If the case is reviewed by the Hearing Committee (see section 3), then the advisor may not take part directly in the hearing itself, though they may communicate with the Complainant or Respondent they represent as necessary as long as it does not disrupt the proceedings. The Complainant and the Respondent will not be allowed to use electronic devices during the meeting with the Investigator, subsequent investigation meetings, reviewing documents, and in any Hearings; except to reveal evidence to the Investigator that is on the electronic device. Interim Measures and Remedies for the Complainant. The Complainant may seek the assistance, in confidence, of the Campus Counselor and/or Campus Minister. Additionally, depending on the specific nature of the problem, the Vice President for Student Life in conjunction with the Title IX Coordinator may direct remedies for the Complainant which may include, but are not limited to: Providing an effective escort to ensure that the Complainant can move safely between classes and activities; Ensuring the Complainant and Respondent do not share classes or extracurricular activities; Moving the Respondent or Complainant (if the Complainant requests to be moved) to a different residence hall; Providing comprehensive, holistic victim services including medical, counseling and academic support services, such as tutoring; Arranging for the Complainant to have extra time to complete or re-take a class or withdraw from a class without an academic or financial penalty. 3. The Title IX Hearing Committee Procedures When the Respondent accepts the finding that he/she violated the Title IX Policy, the findings cannot be appealed by the Respondent. If the Complainant or Respondent is not satisfied with the Title IX Coordinator's findings and/or the remedies/sanctions that the Title IX Coordinator in conjunction with the Vice President for Student Life assigned, the Complainant or Respondent may request a hearing before the Title IX Appeals Hearing Committee (THC). The hearing request must be made in writing within 3 school days to Office of the Vice President for Student Life. If the request is timely filed, the THC shall conduct a hearing in accordance with Section 3.c. within ten school (10) days, after notice to the Complainant or Respondent. For purposes of this decision, the THC will be provided all relevant documents and statements of witnesses, the Respondent, and the Complainant gathered by the Investigator. GENERAL INFORMATION16 | 2016-2017 Academic BulletinThe THC may consult with the Investigator at any time about conflicts in testimony if it will not unduly prejudice the THC decision making process. At any hearing conducted by the THC both the Complainant and the Respondent will be requested to appear, as well as any witnesses they wish to call. If requested, the Complainant and Respondent will not be present at the same time during the hearing, nor is the presence of the Complainant a prerequisite for the hearing to proceed. The failure of either or both parties to appear when properly notified will not prevent the hearing from taking place as scheduled or preclude a decision from being reached. The decision of the THC shall be based on a preponderance of the evidence. If the THC finds, based upon a preponderance of the evidence, that there has been a violation of the Title IX Policy, THC may support the remedies/sanctions assigned by the Title IX Coordinator in conjunction with the Vice President of Student Life or assign further remedies/ sanctions in accordance with Section 3.e. The THC is authorized to assign sanctions as outlined in this edition of the Student Handbook up to suspension. Based on the severity of the violation, the THC may recommend expulsion for the Respondent to the Vice President for Student Life. 4. Appeal to the Executive Appeals Committee The Complainant and the Respondent will both be notified of the THC decision and will both have the option, if dissatisfied, to make written appeals to the Executive Appeals Committee (EAC) through the Office of the Vice President for Student Life. Notice of such appeals must be provided to the Office of the Vice President for Student Life within three (3) school days of the decision of the THC. The ONLY grounds for appeal are as follows: A procedural [or substantive error] occurred that significantly impacted the outcome of the hearing (e.g. substantiated bias, material deviation from established procedures, etc.); To consider new evidence, unavailable during the original hearing or investigation, that could substantially impact the original finding or sanction. A summary of this new evidence and its potential impact must be included; The sanctions assigned are substantially disproportionate to the severity of the violation. If the EAC determines that new evidence should be considered, it will return the complaint to the THC to reconsider in light of the new evidence, only. The reconsideration of the THC is not appealable. If the EAC determines that a material procedural [or substantive] error occurred, it may return the complaint to the THC with instructions to reconvene to cure the error. In rare cases, where the procedural [or substantive] error cannot be cured by the THC (as in cases of bias), the EAC may request a new hearing of the complaint with a new body of hearing officers. The results of a reconvened hearing cannot be appealed. The results of a new hearing can be appealed, once, on the three applicable grounds for appeals. If the EAC determines that the sanctions assigned are disproportionate to the severity of the violation, EAC may then increase, decrease or otherwise modify the sanctions. The decision of EAC is final. E. Criminal Process Victims of sexual assault, rape and/ or date rape are encouraged to seek the criminal prosecution of their assailants. The Campus Safety Office will assist victims who choose to prosecute by transporting them to the Magistrate's Office and providing information in support of the charges being preferred. In cases when the victims wish to remain anonymous, they will be referred to the Sexual Assault and Family Emergency Agency (S.A.F.E.). However, the university will continue to investigate the report in compliance with Title IX. The University views rape, date rape, and sexual assault as grievous violations of the law of God and man, the Code of Honor and the Student Code of Conduct. As such, these offenses will be addressed by the Executive Student Conduct Committee. A student who is proven to have committed or been involved in the commission of such an offense can expect to be suspended or expelled from the University. Should a student be raped or sexually assaulted on the campus or in the vicinity of the school, the victim is urged to report the matter to Campus Safety without delay and preserve all evidence of criminal action. As unpleasant as it may be, the victim should not wash, shower, or change clothes. To a large extent, the victim is the evidence of the crime. The longer the delay between the incident and the time it is reported, the less likely it is that the criminal prosecution will be successful. It should also be noted that state laws dealing with victim compensation and aid limit eligibility for benefits to cases of rape and sexual assault reported within five (5) days. By contacting the Harnett County Sheriff's Deputy at the Campus Safety office, Campus Safety will arrange for proper care and assistance to be provided and for a victim's advocate to be appointed, if the student wishes. Furthermore, the members of the Campus Safety Office pledge that: They will meet with the victim privately, at a place of the victim's choice in the local area, to take a complaint report. They will not release the victim's name to the public or to the press. Their officers will not prejudge or blame the victim for what has occurred. They will treat the victim and the particular case with courtesy, sensitivity, dignity, understanding and professionalism. If the victim feels more comfortable talking with a female rather than a male officer, they will do their best to accommodate the victim's request. They will assist the victim in arranging for any hospital treatment or medical needs. They will assist the victim in privately contacting counseling services and other available resources. They will fully investigate the victim's case and will help the victim achieve the best outcome. This may involve the arrest and full prosecution of the suspect responsible. The victim will be kept up-to-date on the progress of the investigation and/or prosecution. They will continue to be available to the victim to answer questions, explain the systems and processes involved, and be willing listeners. They will consider the victim's case seriously, regardless of the victim's gender. The investigation into the rape or sexual assault will be handled by the Harnett County Sheriff's Office. Refer to the NC General Statute \u00a7 143B- 480.2. regarding victim assistance. The University will assist victims of rape and/or sexual assault in coping with the after-effects of their experience. Referrals for counseling are made by the Campus Minister, University Counselor, Student Support Services, and Health Services Offices. Counseling is also available through some faculty members in the School of Education and by the Lee-Harnett County Mental Health Center, which is located just a short distance off campus. The services of the Harnett County Sexual Assault and Family Emergency (S.A.F.E.) Agency are also available to students. Campbell both supports and is a member of the S.A.F.E. organization. The University is prepared to accommodate reasonable requests for academic schedule and housing changes by victims of rape and campbell.edu/cphs | 17 sexual assault. Such requests should be directed to the Student Life Office. It should be kept in mind that Campbell is a relatively small school. Therefore, it may not be possible to completely avoid unpleasant encounters. Student Health Students may utilize the Student Health Service for preventive services and personal health concerns. For patient privacy and confidentiality, students must not be treated by CPHS faculty in the student's program who may occasionally cover the clinic. The students should identify themselves as a CPHS student when checking into the clinic so that they may be scheduled with an appropriate provider. More information about health services offered is available at http://www.campbell. edu/student-services. Tuition & Fees Tuition and fees are determined annually and are available at http://www.campbell.edu/ cphs/admissions/tuition-financial-aid/. Tuition and fees for the upcoming academic year are estimated and are subject to change. Any new tuition and fee schedules will become effective at the beginning of each entering class of the program. Tuition payment will be due the first week of classes.Graduating students are responsible for the purchase of their regalia. Optional Fees Parking permit Illness insurance (Required for International Students)Withdrawal Procedure: Withdrawal from the CPHS should only be considered after a careful and thorough evaluation of the academic, financial, and personal impacts arising from such an action. Prior to requesting an official withdrawal from the University during a semester, a student should discuss options with their academic advisor and/or program director. To officially withdraw from the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences during a semester, a student must meet with the Assistant Director of Student Affairs and is required to complete an official CPHS Withdrawal Form available in the CPHS Student Affairs Office (Room 119, Maddox Hall, 910-893-1690). The CPHS Withdrawal Form must be completed, with proper signatures obtained, and returned to the Assistant Director of Student Affairs. The Assistant Director of Student Affairs will process the withdrawal and a copy of the appropriate documentation will be placed in the student's permanent file with appropriate administrative offices/personnel notified. This form, once completed, will be distributed to the following offices: Registrar, Financial Aid, Business, Accounting, Veteran's Affairs, and International Admissions, so that a student's record may be closed out in all these areas. Upon completion of the CPHS Withdrawal Form, the Registrar's Office updates class registration as a withdrawal from the University denoting the Withdrawal Effective Date provided on the form. The Business Office verifies all classes have been updated accordingly and reassesses student tuition and fee charges. Failure to withdraw properly will result in full charges and failing grades. Students will be responsible for all grants, scholarships, loans, and federal monies applied toward their tuition and general fees. Students receiving veterans' benefits must report to the Director of Veterans Affairs within thirty days of withdrawing from Campbell University. All graduate and professional programs at CPHS will have published dates for withdrawing from school (each is unique due to different start and stop dates). Withdrawal from CPHS prior to or on the designated withdrawal date will result in a student receiving grades of W for all classes. Withdrawal after the designated withdrawal date will result in a grade determined by the materials completed, usually resulting in a grade of F. When a student withdraws at any time in cases of documented medical emergencies, even after the published last date to withdraw, the grade will be entered as a W. Any student requesting a Medical Withdrawal will be required to provide documentation from a medical professional (in addition to the official CPHS Withdrawal Form), and will be withdrawn from all courses and assigned a grade of W. Please note: in order to be eligible for re-instatement and enrollment after a medical withdrawal was granted, a student must provide documentation from a medical provider that he/she is medically cleared to return to the academic rigors of the graduate/ professional program. GENERAL INFORMATION18 | 2016-2017 Academic Bulletin18 | 2016-2017 Academic BulletinHonor Code We, the students, staff and faculty of Campbell University's College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS), recognize that health care related professions are among the most noble and honorable callings to which one may aspire. These are professions that demand of their members the highest degree of professional competence, ethical behavior, and morality. They require continuous educational development, constant personal and professional self-examination, and an ever- present awareness and sensitivity to human problems. It is the responsibility of every health care related professional, from the day that his or her professional career begins, to seek to achieve the highest aspirations and goals inherent in the profession; to exhibit honor and integrity in the use of his or her special skills for the betterment of humankind; and to act at all times in a manner which will instill public confidence in the profession. We therefore adopt this Honor Code in an attempt to set forth the minimum standards by which our conduct should be governed. Article 1: Academic Matters A. General Statement Recognizing that it is impossible and inadvisable to set forth with specificity a range of conduct that is prohibited, we nevertheless realize that questions arise occasionally with respect to what a student may or may not do in connection with an academic matter. This Honor Code therefore sets forth the minimum standards of conduct with the hope and expectation that a CPHS student will never approach, and certainly never fall below, these minimum standards. It is the obligation of the students and faculty to participate in making the honor system viable by reporting violations of all academic matters. B. Definition An academic matter means any one of the following: any activity which may affect a grade in a course; any activity which in any way contributes to satisfaction of the requirements of a course, or requirements for graduation, or co-curricular activities of an academic nature including student publication and competitions. C. Prohibited Activities with Respect to Academic Matters CPHS students shall not: 1. Use materials during an examination other than those specifically authorized by the instructor. To avoid even the appearance of impropriety during an examination, all books, notebooks, briefcases, and the like should be placed in the front or rear of the examination room. 2. Use of materials in any research or assignment that are specifically forbidden by the instructor. This includes reuse of the student's own work. 3. Engage in any form of plagiarism. Plagiarism is using the words or ideas of another source directly without proper acknowledgment of that source. While it is often necessary to obtain information from other sources, the willful or inadvertent use of information from another source without acknowledging it (including all types of commercial term paper preparation services; internet or electronic database sources for term papers, journal clubs, or case presentations; and other students' work) is considered plagiarism. Ignorance is not an excuse. The student bears the responsibility to learn from the individual instructor the procedure for acknowledging sources and indicating quotations as required for each assignment. 4. Give, solicit, or receive information or assistance to or from any person or source during an examination, makeup examination, or written assignment unless specifically authorized to do so by the instructor. 5. Submit modified or changed tests, answer sheets, or assignments for regrading. 6. Intentionally deface, remove without authorization, or conceal any material from CPHS, the Drug Information Center, or any library. 7. Make an unauthorized or improper use of a computer or computer program, including unauthorized use of programmable calculators during an examination. 8. Fail to report to the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee any first hand knowledge of any violation to any of the aforementioned provisions of this Honor Code. 9. Willfully conceal or misrepresent information material to an investigation of any alleged violation of this Honor Code when the information is sought by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee, faculty, dean, or the dean's designee. Article 2: Non-academic Matters A. General Statement CPHS students are hereby informed that in their personal and professional lives they represent not only themselves, but also CPHS and the health profession. Therefore, while they have the right and freedom to exercise individual autonomy, they also have the responsibility to exercise that autonomy in a manner that will bring honor to themselves, CPHS, and their chosen profession. B. Prohibited Activities with Respect to Nonacademic Matters CPHS students are subject to the same level of conduct as all Campbell University students; students residing in university housing are subject to the rules for all students who reside in university housing. Any infractions of these rules will be handled by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. All students are encouraged to study the sections concerning these violations in the current Campbell University Student Handbook. In addition, CPHS student shall not: 1. Fail to conform his or her conduct to the ethical and moral standards of the health care profession as articulated in the Student Clinical Code of Conduct (Article 9). 2. Intentionally make misrepresentation on a resume or curriculum vitae concerning class rank, grades, academic honors, work experience, or any other matter relevant to job placement. 3. Purposely furnish false information. 4. Perpetrate any form of theft, forgery, falsification, or fraudulent use of university or work-site property. 5. Willfully conceal or misrepresent information material to an investigation of an alleged violation of this Honor Code when the information is sought by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee, faculty, dean, or the dean's designee. 6. Use or remove unauthorized prescription or nonprescription drugs or appliances from the site of a clinical rotation or work- site. Article 3: Violations: Civil Law CPHS shall direct all cases concerning violations of civil laws to the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. Any violations will be handled by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee as described in the University handbook. All students are encouraged to study the section concerning these violations in the Campbell University Student Handbook. Article 4: Penalties A. The associate dean of admissions & student affairs at CPHS may impose the following penalties for any of the violations listed above. campbell.edu/cphs | 19 GENERAL INFORMATION campbell.edu/cphs | 19 Recommendations to the associate dean of admissions & student affairs are submitted by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. Following proper procedures listed in article 5 of this Honor Code, the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee may recommend to the associate dean of admissions & student affairs for one or more of the following penalties: 1. Separation: Separation is a state in which the student is not permitted to continue his/her program at the university. The student shall be withdrawn from all uncompleted courses in which he/she is currently enrolled. The student will not be permitted to re-enter the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences' educational programs. 2. Suspension: Suspension is a temporary state of separation for definite period from the university including the programs, facilities and activities. The completion of the period of suspension does not guarantee reinstatement. The decision to readmit a student will be the responsibility of the associate dean of admissions & student affairs. 3. Probation: Probation can be of two types: Level-one probation Level-one probation for a stated period carries a loss of eligibility for: Holding or running for elected office in student professional organizations; Representing the University in any capacity both on campus and away from campus; Competing for honors and distinctions; Active participation as an elected representative or member of an honorary organization; Obtain reimbursement monies from any funders within the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences. Violation of the terms of level-one probation may result in extended probation, level-two probation, or in the student's suspension. Level-two probation Level-two probation for a stated period carries a loss of eligibility for attendance at any and all CPHS sponsored activities. A student who is placed on level-two probation will automatically be placed on level-one probation. Violation of the terms of level-two probation may result in extended probation or in the student's suspension. The terms of probation will be enforced by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. Other persons may be appointed by the associate dean of admissions & student affairs or the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee to help enforce said terms. 1. Community Service: Community service for a stated number of hours will require a student to perform tasks that will benefit the community or CPHS. Tasks will be assigned and administered by the director of admissions & student affairs. Failure to perform required service in an appropriate fashion may result in probation. 2. Loss or Lowering of the Course Grade: All students who are found guilty of the act of cheating or plagiarism shall receive a score of zero (0) on that specific component of the course (quizzes, tests, projects, assignments). Specific penalties for these violations may also include, but are not limited to, course failure, probation, suspension, and/or separation from the program and the University. A second act of cheating or plagiarism by the student will result in the separation of the student from the University. 3. Reprimand: An official reprimand will be given by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee when the charges are not dismissed. A summary of the offense and the reprimand will be placed in the students file in the dean's office. B. Any professor may define penalties for a student who violates particular course regulations. The professor must clearly state these regulations and penalties in his or her course syllabus. The student has the right to appeal such penalties to the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. Article 5: Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee A. General Statement The associate dean of admissions & student Affairs is responsible for the administration of the CPHS disciplinary system. This responsibility is exercised on behalf of the president of the University and entails the supervision of several bodies. Alleged violations of the University's student code of conduct or civil laws will be handled by the University policies as written in the Campbell University Student Handbook. Alleged violations of the CPHS Honor Code will be evaluated by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. B. Organization The Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee is composed of faculty members from each department, students and the assistant director of student affairs (ex-officio). An ad-hoc member will be chosen to replace any member who cannot or chooses not to attend the proceedings. The associate dean of admissions & student affairs will appoint this member. This committee serves as a hearing board for incidents of misconduct involving violations of the Honor Code. The Honor Code includes standards for academic, non-academic, and clinical behavior. The Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee will make recommendations to the associate dean of admissions & student affairs. The associate dean of admissions & student affairs will then notify the student in writing of actions concerning alleged violations. A record of disciplinary actions is normally maintained by the dean's office until the student graduates or leaves CPHS. Students may examine the contents of their file by appointment with the director of admissions & student affairs. C. Instigation of Hearings When there is a suspicion of academic misconduct, investigation and appropriate actions may be pursued by either the professor of the course in which the alleged misconduct occurred or by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. In either case, the matter must be promptly resolved. If the professor decides to deal with the incident, he or she should report the student's actions to the chair of the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. Individual faculty policies concerning misconduct should be clearly stated in the course syllabus. The accused student has the right to appeal any action by the faculty member to the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee, in which normal committee procedures will be followed. Charges of misconduct may arise from a student (or group of students), professor, adjunct professor or preceptor. Within seven (7) days of the alleged misconduct or discovery of alleged misconduct, the accuser(s) should discuss the situation with either the assistant director of student affairs or the professor in charge of the course. Dated notes should be taken to describe the discussion. Every effort should be made to maintain confidentiality in these discussions. If the accuser(s) has (have) opted to bring the matter before the director of admissions & student affairs, the director should meet with the professor and the chairperson of the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee to explore options. This meeting should take place no longer than seven (7) days after the matter was brought to the attention of the director. The options available 20 | 2016-2017Academic Bulletinfor resolution of the situation include: 1. If a faculty member assigns a student an F or a grade of zero on any assignment or test for which the reason was academic dishonesty, the faculty member must immediately notify the Associate Dean for Admissions and Student Affairs and the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee chairperson (SCPC) in writing of this event. The student does have the right to appeal the faculty's decision. If the SCPC and Associate Dean for Admissions and Student Affairs uphold the faculty's decision OR if the student chooses not to appeal, the record of the offense will remain in the student's file until graduation. If a second violation of the CPHS Honor Code occurs before graduation that is upheld by SCPC or not appealed, the student will automatically be referred to the SCPC for separate, additional sanctions including possible dismissal from the program. If the faculty member involved in the event currently serves on the SCPC, then the faculty member should recuse himself/herself from the committee meeting. 2. The case can be referred to the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee for resolution. Referral to the committee must be by a written memo which names the student, describes the alleged misconduct (including pertinent dates and times), and summarizes the content of earlier meetings regarding this case. 3. The case may be dismissed. Within five (5) days of referral of the case to the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee, the chair of the committee will provide a copy of the referral memo to the accused student(s). In addition, the chairperson will schedule an initial hearing for any charged student with the committee. This hearing should be held within ten (10) days of the referral of the case to the committee. D. Proceedings The chair will begin preliminary investigation of the allegations. Whenever possible, this should include a personal interview with the student, witnesses, and professor involved. Preliminary findings shall be presented at the initial meeting with the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. The chair shall objectively present his or her findings to the committee. The accused student(s) shall meet with the committee and be informed of the allegations and afforded an opportunity to defend him or herself. Although the purpose of this hearing is exploratory and fact finding in nature, the accused student does have the right to solicit advice and to offer witnesses to support his or her position. The committee shall vote on whether or not preliminary findings warrant a full hearing by a simple majority vote. If a hearing is deemed necessary, the chair will notify the student and witnesses of the hearing date in writing at least three (3) days prior to the hearing. A waiver of his or her notice may be made if the student so chooses. A full hearing should be held within ten (10) days of the preliminary committee review. If the committee votes that no hearing is warranted, the case will be dismissed. The chair will file the minutes in the permanent files of the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee and a copy shall be placed in the dean's office until the student graduates or leaves CPHS. Should additional information become available, the chairperson may reopen the case and ask the committee to consider the new information. All sessions of the committee will be closed to all individuals except those immediately concerned in the case, except by the expressed wish of the accused that the hearings be open. No attorney shall be present, as this is not a court of law. In case of a closed hearing, all persons present at the proceedings shall be bound to disclose no more than the committee does in its official report on the case. Revelation of such details will be considered a violation of the Honor Code. In the case of closed hearings, the testimony of each witness shall be given while the other witnesses in the case are out of the room. In open hearings, the witnesses of both parties shall be present during the entire proceedings. The committee may allow introduction of evidence other than testimony of witnesses provided that the evidence is relevant to the question before the committee on any matter. The committee shall set rules for the conduct of all cases and all arrangements connected with the taking of evidence. Time frames for instigation of hearings and proceedings may be altered if circumstances warrant. Votes on all matters shall be a simple majority. Deliberation of the committee shall take place in private and remain secret. Voting on decisions of guilt shall be by secret ballot. If the committee determines that the student was in violation of the Honor Code, it will consider and recommend the appropriate penalty. The student should be informed immediately of the judgment and the recommended penalty in case of guilt. The associate dean of admissions & student affairs may uphold or reject any decision or penalty recommended by the committee. A letter from the associate dean's office will serve as the official notice of judgment and sentence. All minutes and evidence shall be placed in the permanent files of the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee, and a copy will be sent to the associate dean of admissions & student affair's office where it shall remain until the student graduates or leaves CPHS. Article 6: Rights of the Student With respect to violation of the student Honor Code, a student of Campbell University is guaranteed the following rights: 1. The right to a prompt hearing; 2. The right to a reasonable amount of time to prepare for his or her hearing; 3. The right of being presumed innocent until proven guilty; 4. The right to solicit advice; 5. The right to appeal; 6. The right to know his or her accuser; 7. The right to expect that the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee will deal with his or her case in a confidential manner.

Article 9: Student Clinical Code of Conduct CPHS students and faculty have adopted the following code of conduct to guide ethical behavior in hospitals, community pharmacies, research and production facilities, and various rotation sites included as clinical practice experiences. We feel that the magnitude of our responsibility as health care professionals necessitates the establishment of the highest standards of professional conduct. This code of conduct represents general standards of behavior and illustrates ideals for which to strive; however, specific infractions reported by students, preceptors or faculty to the chair of the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee may be investigated by this committee with respect to both the magnitude and chronicity of incidents considered. It should also be understood that these general standards may not afford guidance in every conceivable situation or anticipate every possible infraction. The Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee will be charged with the responsibility of promptly investigating alleged infractions of this code. All cases will require the submission of a report of findings and appropriate recommendations to the associate dean for admissions & student affairs in a timely manner. Students should read, discuss and sign the Honor Code prior to enrollment to CPHS. This code of conduct was created by the students and faculty of CPHS. Modifications of this code will require majority approval of both the faculty and student body. The students attending CPHS will: Respect and Concern for the Welfare of Patients Treat patients and their families with respect and dignity both in their presence and in discussions with others. Recognize when one's ability to function effectively is compromised and ask for relief or help. Recognize the limits of student involvement in the medical care of a patient and seek supervision or advice before acting when necessary. Not use alcohol or other drugs in a manner that could compromise themselves or patient care. Respect for the Rights of Others Deal with professional, staff and peer members of the health care team in a considerate manner and with a spirit of cooperation. Act with an egalitarian spirit toward all persons encountered in a professional capacity regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual preference or socioeconomic status. Respect the patient's modesty and privacy. Trustworthiness Be truthful in communication to others. Maintain confidentiality of patient information. Admit errors and not knowingly mislead others to promote one's self at the expense of the patient. Not represent himself or herself as a pharmacist, physician, physician assistant, or other health professional. Accurately acknowledge the sources for all information reported. Failure to do so will be considered plagiarism. Responsibility and Sense of Duty Participate responsibly in patient care or research to the best of his or her ability and with the appropriate supervision. Undertake clinical duties and persevere until they are complete. Notify the responsible person if something interferes with his or her ability to perform clinical or academic tasks effectively. Professional Demeanor Maintain a neat and clean appearance, and dress in attire that is accepted as professional to the population served. Be thoughtful and professional when interacting with patients and families. Strive to maintain composure during times of fatigue, professional stress, or personal problems. Avoid offensive language, gestures, or inappropriate remarks. Adhere to the CPHS professional dress code. Student Rights In addition to the standards we have adopted for the conduct of ourselves, we expect to be treated with respect as participants in the delivery of health care. CPHS students: Should be challenged to learn, but should not be belittled, humiliated or abused in front of patients, peers or other health professionals. Should not be sexually harassed, either verbally or physically. Should not be discriminated against on the basis of gender, race, religion or sexual preference. Should be a participant in patient care decisions whenever possible. Should have his or her health care related education take priority over routine menial tasks. If a preceptor feels a student lacks adequate knowledge or skills, he or she has the responsibility to inform and instruct that student so he or she can improve his or her performance. If a student feels that a preceptor has committed infractions against the above standards, he or she has the responsibility of informing that preceptor, whether by direct contact or by way of an honest preceptor evaluation at the end of a rotation, of such feelings so that the preceptor can improve his or her performance. NOTE: The above standards of conduct are based on the Code of Conduct for Duke University Medical Students and have been adapted to meet the individual needs of CPHS. Article 10: Pledge A student's signature indicates that he or she agree to uphold the following pledge. This pledge must be signed prior to entry into CPHS. I _______________________________, having read and receiving a clear understanding of the basis, spirit and interpretation of the Honor Code, pledge my personal honor. I will uphold this code and its standards in all matters. If at any time I violate the letter or the spirit of this pledge, I accept full responsibility for my actions. 22 | 2016-2017 Academic BulletinAdministrative Departments Office of the Dean Michael L.

The Department of Clinical Research supports the broad mission of Campbell University and the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences. Academic Programs The Department of Clinical Research offers a Bachelor and Master of Science in Clinical Research degrees as well as a minor. The Master of Science in Clinical Research degree is offered as an online program. The Clinical Research Program is located forty-five minutes from North Carolina's Research Triangle Park, one of the world's largest and most dynamic research centers. Many world-class research hospitals and organizations in this area look to Campbell's clinical research graduates when recruiting new talent. Bachelor of Science in Clinical Research (BSCR) The Bachelor of Science in Clinical Research degree is ideally suited to prepare students for entry-level jobs in the clinical research industry. Students in the program are required to complete an internship in the clinical research field, which provides them with networking opportunities, potential jobs, and experiential training. The department collaborates with sites primarily located throughout North Carolina and neighboring states to facilitate their placement. Students may choose an internship site based on their future career goals, including academics, clinical settings or research management sites. Many BSCR graduates gain employment as a direct result of their internship experience. Online Master of Science in Clinical Research (MSCR) The Master of Science in Clinical Research degree is an online program. The program is designed to educate students in literature evaluation, study design, research methodologies, data management, and statistical analysis and interpretation. Clinical Research The online environment offers enhanced interaction between peers, faculty and industry professionals. The MSCR program culminates with a research project based on the students' therapeutic interest. Students may work independently or collaborate with another MSCR student. The faculty serve as research project advisors throughout the entire research project experience. This degree prepares graduates to enter the field in positions including data managers, medical writers, clinical research monitors, study coordinators, regulatory affairs specialists, Institutional Review Board (IRB) administrators and project specialists. In addition, many graduates pursue professional degrees within the medical and health sciences fields. 3+2 Program The Department of Clinical Research provides an avenue for students to earn both their Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Clinical Research degrees. While the traditional time to earn both degrees is six years, the 3+2 program places students on a fast track toward completing two degrees in five years, by utilizing two summer sessions. By virtue of pursuing both degrees, the program offers students a competitive edge in the job market and rapid career advancement. Consideration for acceptance into this program, students must meet the following requirements: GPA of 3.0 or higher GRE verbal 50th percentile, quantitative 50th percentile, analytical writing 3.0 (a written request may be made for the consideration of PCAT/MCAT/LSAT/GMAT score.

Campbell University undergraduate student pursuing BSCR/MSCR 3+2 Qualified applicants may apply to the MSCR program with the understanding the students will not have a completed degree prior to enrolling in MS coursework as defined in the academic bulletin. Accepted applicants would complete the BS and MS degrees in a five year period as outlined. Please note: The MS degree cannot be conferred upon the students in this category until the requirements of bachelor's degree are met. 3. PharmD/MSCR dual degree applicant An applicant with acceptance into the doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) program may apply for the MSCR program to pursue the PharmD/MSCR dual degree. Since matriculants to the PharmD program are only required to have completed 64 hours of prerequisites, and not required to have an undergraduate degree, these MSCR applicants may enter the program with or without completion of an undergraduate degree prior to enrollment. Accepted applicants have been accepted into both degree programs and normally pursue the degrees over a five year time period. Students without an undergraduate degree cannot graduate with the MSCR until completion of the requirements of doctor of pharmacy degree or bachelor's degree is met. It should be noted the Admissions Committee continues to review the results of pending coursework, test scores and behavior during the admissions and matriculation process. The Admissions Committee reserves the right to rescind the offer of admission due to poor performance or unprofessional behavior.

Wood School of Nursing Campbell University College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences 4250 US 421 South Lillington, NC 27546 910-893-1967 Academic Program The Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree at Campbell University provides the students with the training and education necessary to enter the workforce as a registered nurse. The Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice [American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), 2008]; Nursing Scope and Standards of Practice (2010) and the regulations from the state of North Carolina provide the framework for the liberal arts and pre-licensure nursing education curriculum and the associated clinical experiences. The Essentials address the core knowledge required of nursing professionals and concepts of client centered care, interprofessional teams, evidence-based practice, quality improvement, patient safety, informatics, clinical reasoning, genetics, cultural sensitivity, professional values and practice across the life span. The Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing is dedicated to helping students become the best health care professionals they can be by offering interprofessional education opportunities, top of the line training facilities, and first-hand experience with rural health care needs. Program Philosophy The mission of Campbell University and the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing is to graduate students with exemplary academic and professional skills prepared for purposeful lives and meaningful service as beginning practitioners of nursing. We embrace the concept of a community of learning that is committed to the pursuit, discovery, and dissemination of knowledge. We believe that nursing is a practice discipline that relies on both science and art to provide care that addresses mind, body and spirit. We believe that: The concept of baccalaureate generalist education facilitates the integration of the roles of the nurse as: provider, designer/ manager/coordinator of quality, safe care and member of a profession practicing in a variety of health care settings. A learner-centered environment promotes independence, inquiry, and cultivates the relationship between theory, practice and research. The BSN graduate applies scientific principle, nursing process and evidence based practice to clinically reason caring practices that: promote health and well- being, prevent illness and injury across the lifespan in the care of diverse, underserved clients, families, groups and communities. The BSN graduate recognizes the value of interprofessional health care teams, lifelong learning, interdisciplinary collaboration, professional accountability and responsible use of resources. The BSN graduate embraces a holistic, comprehensive practice that includes the relationship between mind, body and spirit. Mission Statement The mission statement of the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing is consistent with the missions of Campbell University and the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences. Our program mission contains and supports those aspects of the College and University to include leadership, advocacy, service, professionalism, critical inquiry, and interdisciplinary learning. The evidence for Christian principles are within the shared mission through patient-centered care, compassion, ethics, character, and respecting cultural differences. Vision Our graduates will meet future health care needs through the provision of safe, effective quality care, lead purposeful lives and provide meaningful service. Program Objectives Function effectively within nursing and interprofessional teams by fostering open communication, respect and shared decision-making to achieve quality outcomes in patient care. Collect, analyze, and synthesize data to make clinically-reasoned judgments about evidence-based interventions and evaluation of outcomes for the care of diverse, underserved clients, families, groups and communities. Assume accountability for quality and safety for one's own practice and delegated nursing care. Demonstrate knowledge of the influence of policy on social determinants of health and lifestyle variations for interventions related to health promotion, risk reduction and disease prevention for individuals, families, groups, communities and populations across the lifespan and across the continuum of health care. Use knowledge of organizations and systems leadership to design, manage, coordinate, collaborate and negotiate a plan of care with the client/family, interprofessional health care team, and to allocate physical, fiscal and human resources. Behavioral/Social Skills & Professionalism Students in the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing must demonstrate attributes of empathy, compassion, integrity, collegiality, high moral character, excellent interpersonal communication, listening, and self- motivation; as such qualities are assessed throughout the program. Students must exhibit sound judgment in the care of patients and academic inquiry along with developing appropriate and effective patient relations. Additionally, students must be able to function in a collegial environment demonstrating proper levels of assertiveness, task delegation, along with organization and time management skills. Adequate emotional health is necessary to deal with strenuous environments and work effectively in demanding situations. Students must maintain good general health, self-care and hygiene throughout the program. Campbell University, Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing, and CPHS Guidelines The Pre-Nursing student accepts the latest published version of the Campbell University Bulletin Undergraduate Studies and is responsible for being completely familiar with the provisions therein. Upon enrollment into the BSN Degree Program, the student accepts the latest published version of the BSN Degree Student Handbook and is responsible for being completely familiar with the provisions therein. As the School of Nursing is part of CPHS, the student also accepts the latest published version of the CPHS Academic Bulletin whereas it applies to Nursing. Admission Policies The Campbell University admission requirements are necessary for acceptance and designation of a Pre-Nursing intent. The student will be required to take the prerequisites for the pre-nursing program. The application for the BSN portion occurs during the fall. This process requires a competitive application for admission to the degree program. BSN Admission The process of BSN Division admission will be a joint collaborative effort with the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS) Admissions Office. The admissions campbell.edu/cphs | 41 NURSING campbell.edu/cphs | 41 process includes meeting specific prerequisite coursework with a minimum grade of \"C\". Coursework may be in progress at the time of application, but completed by the start of the BSN Coursework. The admissions process includes an electronic application that opens annually in January. The final application deadline is January 31st of that year. The application is more competitive when the student completes all prerequisites at the end of the spring semester before fall matriculation to the BSN Program. 1. The preferred minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) is a 3.0 on a 4.0 scale with the minimum for admission a 2.8. 2. BSN Science Grade Point Average of 3.0 or above is preferred (Biology, Microbiology, Human Anatomy I & II) is preferred. The minimum science GPA for admission is 2.75. 3. The admissions process may include a personal interview at which time the applicant will submit a written essay. 4. The admissions committee will evaluate each applicant's academic performance, essay, service history, special skills, and abilities that enhance the nursing profession. 5. Applicants will be notified by the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing of an admissions decision through email and an official decision letter to be delivered early in the spring for a fall start. Pre-Nursing students that do not achieve qualified status will be advised as to alternate degree options at Campbell University. 6. Admission and graduation from Campbell University does not guarantee that the student is eligible to sit for the NCLEX-RN exam. It should be noted the Admissions Committee continues to review the results of pending coursework and behavior during the admissions and matriculation process. The Admissions Committee reserves the right to rescind the offer of admission due to poor performance or unprofessional behavior. BSN Transfer Credit The Registrar's Office is responsible for the transferring of credits from other institutions onto the Campbell University transcript. A transfer student must meet the core requirements and apply to the BSN division, through the electronic college Application website. 1. The cumulative GPA from transferred coursework is considered as part of the holistic competitive application to the BSN Degree Program. 2. A grade of \"C\" or better must have been earned in the BSN course work and been completed within the previous three years. 3. For transfer credit of BSN level courses, the official transcript and copy of the course syllabus must be submitted to the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing for determination of course equivalency by a faculty with expertise or the BSN Curriculum Committee. Transfer credit is not granted automatically and is restricted to didactic courses with no clinical component. A letter from the former Dean/Director indicating that the student left in good academic and professional standing is required. 4. CPHS reserves the right to make changes in requirements for admission, curriculum, standards for progression, advancement and graduation, fees and rules and regulations. Program Requirements Health Care Provider Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Certificate prior to BSN division coursework Criminal background check Applicants must have documentation of the following vaccines and health assessments prior to BSN division coursework and planned clinical rotations: annual and Varicella titer, Tetanus toxoid, Influenza, Hepatitis B and a drug screen.

The use of an assistive device to demonstrate ability is considered Negative Substance Abuse Screening Academic Progression in the BSN Program Student Progression within the BSN Degree varies from the standard grade scale and progression and remediation effort for undergraduate students. This academic rigor is essential for the assumption that the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing BSN graduate is a safe and effective care provider. Grading Scales Nursing A 93-100 B 85-92 C 75-84 D 68-74 F <67 1. Courses must be completed in the prescribed sequence and within 6 years of matriculation. 2. A student must earn a grade of 2.0 (75) in each nursing course. 3. Rounding of Methods of Evaluation- the calculation of a grade will be based on rounding a score ranging from number + 0.5 below the number to + .49 above the number to the common whole number (Example: A grade of 75 = 74.5 through 75.49; 74 = 73.5 through 74.49). Rounding does not occur for end of course grades. 4. In the clinical nursing courses (Fundamentals of Nursing Practice with Older Adults, Adult Health Nursing Practice I and II, Women's Health/ Pediatrics, Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing Practice, and the Focused Client Experience Practicum) 85% of the course is dependent on test/ examinations with 15% distribution among other assignments (papers, presentations, clinical paperwork). 5. A student must achieve an average grade of 75% on all test/examinations in order to successfully complete courses. If less than a 75% average is earned, the course grade is computed only on the test/examination average. If the 75% average is earned, all graded course requirements will be computed into the score. 6. A student earning a grade of less than 2.0 must repeat the course. If a student earns less than 2.0 or in a second nursing course, the student is dismissed from the program and is ineligible for readmission. A nursing course can be repeated one time only. 7. Two course failures within the BSN division results in dismissal from the program with an ineligible status for readmission. Tuition and Fees The Board of Trustees annually reviews and approves the tuition and fee schedule. The published information is on the website and updated in March of each year. Reference the General Information section in this bulletin for more details. There will be additional expenses upon entry to the BSN Degree Program. These may 42 | 2016-2017 Academic Bulletin42 | 2016-2017 Academic Bulletininclude but are not limited to the following: scrub uniform, lab coat, lab kit, transportation to clinical, cost of NCLEX-RN testing, CPR certification, immunizations, books, supplies and graduation expenses. Financial Aid For information on financial aid availability and application procedures, please contact the student financial planning office at (910) 893-1310 or visit www.campbell.edu/ admissions/financialaid/ Vehicular Requirements All students of the nursing program are required to provide his/her own transportation to and from the University as well as to the clinical experience sites. Conduct The enrolled student is accountable for all aspects of the current Student Conduct (Professional, Academic and The Honor Code) as defined in the Undergraduate Academic Bulletin and the General Information section of this academic bulletin for the Honor Code. Nursing students are required to read and sign the Honor Code, attesting that they understand the code that they have read and understand the bulletin, and will abide by it. A signed copy of the code will be kept in the students file. Academic Standards A Campbell University academic review convenes in May of each year to review the academic progress of undergraduate students. An \"Academic Warning\" is issued to any student who incurs a quality point deficit between 10 and 34.5 quality points. The student is referred to campus resources for resolution. The Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing has additional progression requirements and focused remediation efforts designed to protect the student and public in care delivery situations while assuring a greater opportunity for success. Please refer to Student Handbook for the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing or the CPHS Academic Bulletin for details. Reports on academic performance and progress are generated at the mid-term and completion of each semester. The Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing core faculty meets at the end of each academic term, or as necessary, to discuss the academic performance of all students. Any discussions regarding type of academic deficiency and remedy occurs with development of an Academic Success Plan and draft of a letter from the program director stating the specific academic standing described in the following sections. The letter is provided to the student via email and hard copy by mail. The letter will contain the following: Description of academic standing (remediation, probation, suspension, dismissal) Rationale for academic standing Criteria required to regain good academic standing Contact information of the program director to discuss items outlined in the letter Notification of appeals process Good Academic Standing Students are considered in good academic standing providing: A semester GPA 75 or 2.0 average cumulative grade point (GPA) based on the BSN grading criteria Satisfactory evaluation on the Clinical Evaluation Tool for clinical experiences No violations of student Honor Code or Code of Conduct have occurred No occurrence of a patient safety violation Remediation Students who fail to meet academic standards within a given course or clinical experience rotation may be required to remediate coursework and/or attend another clinical. Students will require remediation for: Failure to achieve a semester GPA 75 or 2.0 average cumulative grade point (GPA) based on the BSN grading criteria A grade of D or F in any single course Students must initiate remediation with the Course Director should a grade of < 80% or failure on any examination within a given course. The course instructor and student document the content of remediation on the Academic Success Plan. Successful remediation must occur within the identified time frame or the student is placed on academic probation. Should a student fail to improve academic and/or behavioral performance issues, they will receive a failing grade for the course. This will necessitate a delay in the graduation date. Continuing Needs Improvement or Unsatisfactory ranking on the Clinical Evaluation Tool Violations of student Honor Code or Code of Conduct Any patient safety issue throughout the curriculum Academic Probation Academic probation is the initial action for a student failing to make satisfactory academic progress following remediation interventions. A student will be placed on academic probation for: Inability to maintain a cumulative GPA of 75 or 2.0 based on the BSN grading criteria Failure to follow through with the Academic Success Plan (remediation) Continuing Needs Improvement or Unsatisfactory ranking on the Clinical Evaluation Tool A grade of D or F in any single course Repeated violations of the student Honor Code or Code of Conduct Violations of patient safety Accumulation of more than three Academic Success Plans in one semester A student placed on academic probation will remain so until the end of the semester. Students who fail to complete the criteria for lifting academic probation will be considered for suspension or dismissal from the BSN program. The BSN Curriculum Committee and program director, with notification to the Associate dean for academic affairs, will recommend these actions. A recommendation will be made to the program director to restore good academic standing if: A semester GPA 75 or 2.0 average cumulative grade point (GPA) based on the BSN grading criteria is achieved The Academic Success Plan was followed with desired results achieved Satisfactory evaluation on the Clinical Evaluation Tool for clinical experiences No violations of student Honor Code or Code of Conduct have occurred No occurrence of a patient safety violation Academic Suspension Academic suspension from the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing and CPHS are imposed for a specified period of time and must not exceed one year. Suspension occurs when a student has academic deficiencies which preclude continuation in a normal program of study, but may be expected to be able to complete the requirements for the degree under a modified program of study with or without remedial courses. A student on academic suspension is not allowed to continue the standard course of study. The Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing Curriculum Committee and program director will specify the length of time of the suspension and remedial work required for reinstatement, with approval from the associate dean for academic affairs. Academic Dismissal The Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing Curriculum Committee and program director campbell.edu/cphs | 43 NURSING campbell.edu/cphs | 43 may recommend academic dismissal to the associate dean for academic affairs under the following circumstances:. Fails to make satisfactory progress during the period of probation and or suspension A single egregious and/or knowing violation of patient safety, confidentiality, or professionalism Two semesters with the accumulation of three or more Academic Success Plans A student earning a grade of less than a 75 or 2.0 average cumulative grade point (GPA) based on the BSN grading criteria, must repeat the course. If a student earns less than 2.0 in a second nursing course, student dismissal occurs. This dismissal results in being ineligible for readmission. A repeat of a nursing course occurs one time only. Unsatisfactory clinical performance constitutes a course failure and necessitates repeating the course, if eligible. If a student earns less than 2.0 in a second nursing course, student dismissal occurs. This dismissal results in being ineligible for readmission. A repeat of a nursing course occurs one time only. Academic Status Appeals At the end of each academic term, the program director will notify each student, the Academic Performance and Standards Committee chair and the associate dean for academic affairs of the students that qualify for academic probation, suspension, or dismissal. The Academic Performance and Standards Committee (APSC) evaluate each student that is subject to suspension or dismissal in order to make a recommendation whether to retain or promote the student in the professional program. The student may appear in person before the committee. The chair of the APSC notifies students in writing regarding any decision by the committee to require a modified course of study, to suspend enrollment, or to dismiss the student from the College and informs the director of nursing, Associate dean for academic affairs, and Associate Dean of Admissions & Student Affairs. Students have the opportunity to appeal any decision made by the APSC by submitting a written petition to the Associate dean for academic affairs within seven days of their receipt of notification. The petition must contain the specific variance requested, a description of any extenuating circumstances intended to justify granting the variance, and a proposed course of study and/or conditions for consideration should the variance be granted. The decision of the Associate dean for academic affairs is final. Withdrawal A student may withdraw from a course without grade assignment at any time prior to the end of the fourth week of a semester. Withdrawal from a course after that period will result in a recorded grade. In the event a student must withdraw from the College, he or she will be responsible for obtaining the required form for withdrawal from the University Registrar. It is also the student's responsibility to complete the prescribed administrative procedures to assure notification to all individuals and offices that require this information. In cases of serious illness, injuries, or extreme circumstances which normally would require the student's withdrawal from the College, the student may fully withdraw from all semester coursework without receiving a grade. Such cases require adequate documentation of the circumstances and approval by program director. Delayed Graduation Policy If a nursing student is required to re-take classes as a result of specific course failure or a deficiency in overall academic performance, then a delay in scheduling nursing clinical experiences or matriculation through the curriculum will occur and the student's graduation may be delayed. Voluntary course withdrawals or a temporary leave of absence may cause a delay in scheduling clinical experiences, progress through the curriculum, and a subsequent delay in graduation. Any alteration in the normal curriculum progression may affect a student's financial aid status or qualification for education-based financial aid. For specific counseling and advice, students should contact the College's Office of Academic Affairs and the University's Office of Financial Aid. Graduation Requirements Recommendation for graduation requires faculty approval and attainment of the following requirements: 1. Successful completion of all courses, requirements, and remediation 2. Successful completion of all clinical experiential training 3. Attendance of graduation week activities that includes licensure preparation courses and comprehensive curriculum review 4. Attendance at the graduation ceremony is expected The BSN Division Requirements for Graduation Completion of the nursing and general education courses prescribed by the faculty. Completion of nursing courses with a minimum grade of 2.0 (75) in each course Attainment of a minimum 2.0 cumulative GPA (see grading scale variation) 25% of semester credit hours in residence at Campbell University Attendance at the graduation ceremony is expected. A faculty vote is required to approve students for graduation. All BSN students are required to complete the BSN Exit Survey on-line in the fourth semester during the Focused Client Care Practicum. The Catherine W. Wood of Nursing appoints a faculty advisor for each student to assist the student with program planning and tracking of prerequisites and BSN division requirements. However, the responsibility for assuring that all requirements are met rests solely with the student. Registered Nurse Licensure Exam Requirements The North Carolina Board of Nursing (NC- BON) uses the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX\u00ae) prepared by National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) to measure competence for entry-level prac- tice for graduates of Board-approved nursing education programs. The National Council of State Boards of Nursing has contracted with Pearson VUE to administer NCLEX\u00ae.For more detailed information about the NCLEX, please visit the National Council of State Boards of Nursing's website. Eligibility requirements for examination: Completion of a member Board approved RN nursing education program Registration with Pearson Vue is required prior to the release of an Authorization to Test (ATT) All applicants must complete a criminal background check prior to the issuance of a license The Board of Nursing determines if the student with a prior criminal conviction is allowed to sit for the NCLEX-RN exam. Please note that conferring a degree to a student who has completed the curriculum does not guarantee that the Board of Nursing will issue an Authorization to Test.44 | 2016-2017 Academic Bulletin44 | 2016-2017 Academic BulletinCurriculum The Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice [American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), 2008]; Nursing Scope and Standards of Practice (2010) provide the framework for the development of the liberal arts and pre- licensure nursing education curriculum and the associated clinical experiences. The Essentials address the core knowledge required of nursing professionals and concepts of client centered care, interprofessional teams, evidence-based practice, quality improvement, patient safety, informatics, clinical reasoning, genetics, cultural sensitivity, professional values and practice across the life span. The practice experience in the final two years enhances the connections with didactic content and facilitates growth across the curriculum. The rationale for sequencing of courses facilitates moving from the simple to the complex. Students begin their nursing courses by learning to assess and plan care for meeting basic needs of the independent community based adult followed by the nursing home resident at variable levels of required skill. Upon completion of the program, students are working as a team member to organize, implement, collaborate and evaluate nursing care for groups of clients/families, community groups and populations. The student evaluations demonstrate increasing expectations in clinical performance.

Academic Standards BS in Pharmaceutical Sciences Academic standards for undergraduate programs are specified in the Campbell University's Undergraduate Academic Bulletin. MS in Pharmaceutical Sciences The academic success of our students is of utmost importance in the MSPS program in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences. The main purpose of the PS Graduate Academic Performance & Standards (GAPS) policy is to identify and alert students with low academic performance as early as possible and provide assistance to improve their performance to successfully finish the program. 1. Students must have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 in all MSPS courses to graduate from the program, and all courses (Core courses, track-specific course and electives) must be completed with a grade of C or better. Earning any credits of D or F will result in dismissal. 2. Students must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 to remain in good academic standing. Failure to maintain this minimum GPA will result in a probationary period, not exceeding one semester. The student will be dismissed if the required cumulative GPA has not been achieved at the end of the probationary period. 3. Students dismissed from the program may appeal to the MSPS Graduate Academic Performance and Standards (GAPS) Committee to be reinstated. Upon reinstatement, any course with a grade of D or F must be repeated at the next course 48 | 2016-2017 Academic Bulletin48 | 2016-2017 Academic Bulletinoffering, unless the Committee otherwise allows. 4. Students must complete all coursework within seven (7) years of entering the MSPS program. The chair of the GAPS Committee will periodically review students' files and forward his/her findings to the director of pharmaceutical sciences programs. The director in turn will notify the student in writing or by email concerning his/her standing in the program. A student may appeal the director's decision to the Committee (see Rule 3 above). The student must submit a written or email petition to the chair of the Committee within two weeks of the student's receipt of notification of the enforcement action. The Committee's recommendations are forwarded to the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs of the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences for a review. The Committee's chair will notify the student in writing or by email concerning the Committee's recommendations. Upon receipt, the student can appeal the decision to the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs for a final review. The Associate Dean's decision is final. Grade Appeals Students in the Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences (MSPS) program who feel that they have a just reason for appealing a grade in a College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences course must first appeal to the course instructor. If the issue cannot be adequately resolved with the instructor, then the student should appeal to the course master. If no resolution is achieved at that level, the student should appeal to the appropriate department chair. After efforts within the department, a student may appeal to the Graduate Academic Performance and Standards Committee (MSPS program) to seek resolution. If the student still feels that the resolution is not just, the student must submit a written petition to the associate dean for academic affairs of the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences within seven days of the student's receipt of notification of the Graduate Academic Performance and Standards Committee (MSPS program) decision. The petition must contain the specific variance requested and a description of any extenuating circumstances intended to justify granting the variance. The decision of the associate dean for academic affairs of the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences is final.Curriculum BS in Pharmaceutical Sciences Fall Semester 1 Spring Semester 2 Fall Semester 3 Spring Semester 4 Fall Semester 5 Spring Semester 6 Fall Semester 7 Spring Semester 8 *Internship sites may require a criminal background check before beginning the internship.

Technical Standards for Admission & Matriculation The American Council on Pharmaceutical Education (ACPE), the accrediting body for colleges and schools of pharmacy, requires that Doctor of Pharmacy curricula meet standards and guidelines which emphasize a strong scientific foundation and practice- based competency. The pharmacy curriculum is designed to develop caring and competent pharmacists, practitioners who assume responsibility for safe and effective medication use in patients. The pharmacy curriculum is also designed to produce pharmacists who are collaborative partners in the care of patients within an interdisciplinary health care system. Technical Standards refer to nonacademic admissions and matriculation criteria that are essential to participation in the Doctor of Pharmacy program. All students must possess the intellectual, ethical, physical, and emotional capabilities required to undertake the full curriculum and to achieve the levels of competence required by the faculty. The technical standards described below are essential functions and therefore prerequisites for entrance, continuation, promotion, and graduation from the Doctor of Pharmacy program, with or without appropriate accommodations in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Candidates for admission to and graduation from the Campbell University College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences Doctor of Pharmacy Program must possess the following abilities: Observation The candidate/student-pharmacist must be able to observe required lectures, demonstrations and experiments, including but not limited to microscopic studies, pharmaceutical lab instruction (technical quality of prepared and compounded materials), and patient care demonstrations (physical observation and physical assessment). A candidate/student-pharmacist must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand, noting non-verbal and verbal signals. Observation necessitates functional use of vision, hearing and somatic senses. The candidate/student- pharmacist must be capable of remaining alert and attentive at all times in the clinical setting. Communication A candidate/student-pharmacist must be able to effectively speak, read and write in English. Visual and auditory senses must be intact to detect verbal and nonverbal communication signals. A candidate/student-pharmacist must be able to elicit information from and communicate effectively and sensitively with patients. The candidate must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in oral and written form with all members of the health care team. Motor Abilities A candidate/student-pharmacist must have sufficient motor function to carry out the 58 | 2016-2017 Academic Bulletin58 | 2016-2017 Academic Bulletinbasic laboratory experiments and physical assessment. The candidate/student- pharmacist must be able to carry out duties within the classroom, laboratory, pharmacy and clinic settings. Motor function must be sufficient to perform fundamental patient care, such as required for disease prevention, drug therapy monitoring, emergency treatment, general care and basic physical assessment (e.g. blood pressure assessment, palpation for edema, injection of vaccines, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, etc.). Motor function must also be sufficient to perform drug distribution duties in both a community and hospital pharmacy setting. Candidates/student- pharmacists must have the ability to maintain aseptic technique in the preparation of sterile materials. This will require the ability to work under a laminar flow hood and in sterile rooms Candidates must possess the motor function sufficient to direct and supervise the accurate compounding and preparation of medications for dispensing to patients. A candidate/ student pharmacist must be able to safely and effectively operate various types of laboratory and patient care equipment such as weights and balance, a glucose meter, stethoscope and sphygmomanometer. They must be able to use computer-based information systems. These motor actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium and functional use of the senses of touch, vision, and hearing. Additionally, some aspects of patient care require that the student-pharmacist be able to act quickly and speed of motor function may be an essential requirement. Intellectual, Conceptual, Integrative, and Quantitative Problem solving, the critical skill demanded of pharmacists, requires that a candidate/ student-pharmacist be able to learn, retrieve, analyze, sequence, organize, synthesize and integrate information efficiently, and reason effectively. In addition a candidate/ student-pharmacist should possess the ability to measure and calculate accurately, to perceive three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. Behavioral and Social Attributes A candidate must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of his/her intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients, and the development of mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients and their family members, staff, and colleagues. Each candidate must be able to work effectively as a member of a health-care team. Candidates must be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. They must be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, collegiality, interest, and motivation are all personal qualities that are assessed during the admission and education processes. Equal Access to the CPHS Doctor of Pharmacy Program In accordance with Campbell University's nondiscrimination policy, the College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences does not discriminate against otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities who apply for admission to the Doctor of Pharmacy Program. It is recognized that the on-site interview may not adequately evaluate a student's ability to meet the technical standards. Students who are unsure that they meet the technical standards because of a disability are responsible for disclosing that to the Campbell University Office of Student Success. The Director of Access and Outreach in that office will consult with the student regarding possible accommodations. At the time an applicant accepts an offer to the CPHS Doctor of Pharmacy Program, students must attest in writing that they are able to meet the CPHS Doctor of Pharmacy Program Technical Standards for Admission & Matriculation with or without accommodations. Students will continue to attest in writing during orientation through the fourth year that they are still able to meet the standard. The Campbell University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences (CPHS) Doctor of Pharmacy Program is committed to providing reasonable accommodation to ensure that equal access is provided to all otherwise qualified students in the course of study leading to the Doctor of Pharmacy degree and licensure. Accommodations Accepted students with a disability who believe they may require accommodations to meet these standards should contact the Campbell University Director of Access and Outreach immediately upon accepting the offer of admission. The Director of Access and Outreach will consult with CPHS faculty and administration to determine what reasonable accommodations can be made. Candidates pursuing the academic program who lack the ability to appropriately meet these standards and who do not seek accommodations may place themselves in academic jeopardy. The use of an intermediary, a person trained to perform essential skills on behalf of the student, is not permitted. Should a candidate develop a condition during their education in the Doctor of Pharmacy Program that would affect their ability to meet the above technical standards, they must contact the Director of Access and Outreach to determine whether or not a reasonable accommodation can be made. Again, candidates pursuing the academic program who lose the ability to appropriately meet these standards and who do not seek accommodations may place themselves in academic jeopardy. The Director of Access and Outreach will meet with the student to discuss areas of concern. The Director will then develop an accommodation plan, consulting regularly with the CPHS Office of Academic Affairs, the CPHS Office of Admissions & Student Affairs, the CPHS Office of Experiential Education, the CPHS Pharmacy Practice Department, and other offices as needed during the process. The accommodation plan will require the approval of the above departments, Student Success, and the student. Appeals Process Accepted students who are unable to meet the Technical Standards, with or without accommodation, will not be offered admission and will be notified by the Admissions Committee. Enrolled students who are found not to meet the Technical Standards, with or without accommodation, will be evaluated by the CPHS Academic Performance and Standards Committee and will use the appeals process for that committee's work. Student-pharmacists who disagree with an accommodation decision made by the office of Student Success will use that office's grievance process which can be found in the \"Student Guide to Accessing Disability Services\" on the Student Success website. The above standards mirror our current CPHS PA program technical standards and were modified based on language incorporated from the Technical Standards documents of University of Mississippi, University of Iowa, Kentucky University, and University of California, San Francisco schools of pharmacy. campbell.edu/cphs | 59 PHARMACY campbell.edu/cphs | 59 Academic Standards Retention and Promotion Criteria Full-time students enrolled in the doctor of pharmacy program at the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS) are expected to make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of the degree requirements. Satisfactory academic progress is defined as successful completion in the prescribed time, maintenance of a 2.2 semester grade point average (SGPA), professionally required course grade point average (PGPA), and a cumulative grade point average (CGPA), and completion of any professional deficiencies and/or required remedial courses in the time and manner prescribed. PGPA calculations are based only on professionally required courses, and do not include grades earned in elective courses. Students who fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress in the professional program are automatically placed on academic probation. They may be required to participate in academic counseling, be enrolled in a remedial program of study or suspended/dismissed according to the policies described in the subsequent sections. Such actions will be determined by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee, with notification to the associate dean for academic affairs. The student will be notified of these actions by the chair of the Academic Performance and Standards Committee. Actions taken in these matters are not to be viewed as punitive, but as a recognition that it is unrealistic to continue in a course of study where there is little probability of success. These same standards will be applied to students enrolled in an approved part-time course of study. 1. Academic Probation Academic probation is the initial action for a student failing to make satisfactory academic progress. A student will be placed on academic probation for: Failure to maintain a minimum SGPA of 2.20; Failure to maintain a PGPA of 2.20; Failure to maintain a CGPA of 2.20; A failing grade in a professionally required course; Two or more \"D\" grades in professionally required courses in one semester; Unauthorized failure to complete any degree requirement at the prescribed time.Depending on the nature of the academic deficiencies and overall academic record, a student placed on academic probation may or may not be permitted to continue in the regular sequence of the professional curriculum. A student failing a course in sequence may be permitted to take the next course in the sequence, if directed by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee as part of a modified course of study, or by gaining written permission from the associate dean for academic affairs. If a student fails a professionally required course, it must be repeated during the next term the course is offered. A student placed on academic probation is typically given one semester to correct any grade point deficiencies. The Academic Performance and Standards Committee will review the student's record at the end of the term of probation: If the SGPA and PGPA for that term are 2.20 or above, and the CGPA is 2.20 or above, the student will be released from academic probation. If SGPA and PGPA are 2.20 or above, but the CGPA is below 2.20, the student will remain on academic probation. A student remaining on academic probation for more than two consecutive semesters will be subject to suspension or dismissal. If a student fails to make satisfactory progress during the period of academic probation, and/or fails to correct academic deficiencies, within the prescribed time, that student will be subject to automatic suspension and may be dismissed from CPHS. 2. Academic Suspension Academic Suspension from CPHS occurs when a student: Has failed to make satisfactory progress as demonstrated by SGPA or PGPA less than 2.20, or received more than a single \"D\" grade in a professionally required course during a period of academic probation; Has academic deficiencies which preclude continuation in a normal program of study, but may be expected to be able to complete the requirements for the degree under a modified program of study with or without remedial courses; Has received a failing grade in any two professionally required courses. Suspensions are imposed for a specified period of time and must not exceed one year. A student on academic suspension is not allowed to continue the standard course of study. The Academic Performance and Standards Committee will specify the length of time of the suspension, remedial work required for reinstatement, and the program of study required upon re-instatement. 3. Academic Dismissal Academic dismissal from CPHS will occur when a student: Fails to make satisfactory progress during a period of academic probation or suspension; Has academic deficiencies which preclude continuation in the prescribed program of study, and may not reasonably be expected to complete the requirements of the degree. Except under very extenuating circumstances, academic dismissal will be recommended if a student: Was previously suspended from the College and again failed to make satisfactory academic progress; Is on academic suspension under a remedial course of study and again fails to make satisfactory academic progress as demonstrated by SGPA or PGPA less than 2.20, or earns more than a single D-grade in professionally required courses for that term; Fails a single professionally required course more than one time, or accumulates more than two failures in professionally required courses; Accumulates a grade point deficiency which reasonably precludes the possibility of completing the degree requirements. A student dismissed from the College may seek re-entry by applying for re-admission using the standard admissions process. Academic Status Appeals At the end of each academic term, the Academic Performance and Standards Committee chair reviews the academic performances of all students enrolled in CPHS. The chair notifies each student who does not meet the academic standards as defined by the academic regulations at CPHS. The College's associate dean for academic affairs is also notified. Each student subject to suspension or dismissal is evaluated by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee in order to determine whether to retain or promote the student in the professional program. The student may appear in person before the committee. The chair of the Academic Performance and Standards Committee notifies students in writing regarding any decision by the committee60 | 2016-2017 Academic Bulletin60 | 2016-2017 Academic Bulletinto require a modified course of study, to suspend enrollment, or to dismiss the student from the College and informs the associate dean for academic affairs and associate dean of admissions & student affairs. Students have the opportunity to appeal any decision made by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee by submitting a written petition to the associate dean for academic affairs within seven days of their receipt of notification. The petition must contain the specific variance requested, a description of any extenuating circumstances intended to justify granting the variance, and a proposed course of study and/or conditions for consideration should the variance be granted. The decision of the associate dean for academic affairs is final. Any student on probation or suspension for a stated period is automatically ineligible to: Hold or run for elected office in student professional organizations; Represent the University in any capacity either on campus or away from campus (see policy below for additional information); Compete for honors and distinctions; Participate as an elected representative or member of an honorary organization; Obtain reimbursement monies from any funders in the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (see policy below for additional information). Event Attendance Policy While on any level of probation or suspension, students are unable to represent the university in any outside event such as regional or national conferences/meetings. A student may appeal this decision by submitting a written petition to the Academic Performance and Standards Committee addressing the conference or meeting they desire to attend, why they want to attend this meeting, how attendance at this meeting would benefit their education and provide documentation of how they have improved their academic studies during the semester. Reimbursement Policy While on any level of probation or suspension, students are unable to receive any reimbursement monies from any funders in the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences. The student's academic status will be confirmed upon any request for such funds. Remediation Policy After a Failure OccursIf a student fails a course despite the efforts made for early academic difficulty detection, re-taking of the course will be required. As directed by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee (APSC), the student may take the course again in the following summer session after the original course was taken. For example, if a student fails PHAR XXX, he/she will register for and re-take it as a summer course. This will result in additional tuition charges for the summer course, which may be assessed on a per-credit hour basis. A student may only take the remediation course at the direction of the APSC with authorization by the CPHS Associate dean for academic affairs. The remediation course will be a Summer Session III registered course. The actual duration and schedule for the course will be determined by the course director. The Task Force recommends that the course duration meets the following recommendations: a minimum of 1 week per credit hour and a maximum of 2 weeks per credit hour. The remediation course should be similar in scope and content to the original course. The remediation course will be available to the student primarily as a self-directed module with the student(s) viewing the lectures that were recorded at the time the student was originally enrolled in the course. The remediation course will be supplemented with weekly conferences with the instructor(s) to ensure student progress. Weekly conferences with the instructor(s) may be held in person, via email, by phone, or with other technology (at the discretion of the individual instructor). A comparable number of exams should be administered during the remediation course. Exams may be of a different format, with a different number of questions; however, the exams should cover the same material covered during the regular course. Exams may be given via ExamSoft. The student will be required to take all course exams ON CAMPUS as offered through the coursemaster or his/her affiliate. Exam dates will be communicated at the beginning of the course. Exam dates, office hours, or conference times with the instructor(s) will also be specified in the syllabus. Whether the student passes or fails the remediation course, his or her progression in the curriculum will be determined by the APSC. In addition, any student who has NOT failed a course, but has a cumulative GPA lower than 2.2, may also take a remediation course if it is recommended by the APSC and approved by the CPHS Associate dean for academic affairs. Students will only be allowed to take 1 summer remediation course per summer. If greater than 1 course is required for remediation, the student should repeat any additional courses during the regularly scheduled Fall/Spring semester. Students may only take a summer remediation course when recommended by the APSC. Grade Appeals Students with a just reason for appealing a grade in a course at CPHS must first appeal to the course instructor. If the issue cannot be adequately resolved with the instructor, then the student should appeal to the course master. If no resolution is achieved at that level, the student should appeal to the appropriate department chair. After efforts within the department, a student may appeal to the Academic Performance and Standards Committee to seek resolution. If the student feels that the resolution is not just, the student must submit a written petition to the associate dean for academic affairs within seven days of the student's receipt of notification of the Academic Performance and Standards Committee decision. The petition must contain the specific variance requested and a description of any extenuating circumstances intended to justify granting the variance. The decision of the associate dean for academic affairs is final. Advancement to a Higher Class Advancement to a higher class requires: To a Second Professional Year 1. A cumulative grade point average of 2.20 or higher; 2. Completion of all first professional year courses; 3. Completion of all pre-professional requirements 4. Exceptions may be granted by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee and/or the associate dean for academic affairs. To Third Professional Year 1. A cumulative grade point average of 2.20 or higher; 2. Completion of all second professional year courses 3. Exceptions may be granted by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee and/or the associate dean for academic affairs. To Fourth Professional Year 1. A cumulative grade point average of 2.20 or higher; 2. Completion of all third professional year coursescampbell.edu/cphs | 61 PHARMACY campbell.edu/cphs | 61 Delayed Graduation Policy If a pharmacy student is required to re- take classes as a result of specific course failure or a deficiency in overall academic performance, then a delay in scheduling advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) will occur and the student's graduation will be delayed. Voluntary course withdrawals or a temporary leave of absence will also cause a delay in scheduling APPE and a delay in graduation. Any alteration in the normal curriculum progression may affect a student's financial aid status or qualification for education-based financial aid. For specific counseling and advice students should contact the College's Office of Academic Affairs and the University's Office of Financial Aid. Policy examples: If a student is forced to withdraw from any or all courses in the fall semester, then he or she returns to a delayed schedule in fall of the next year (delaying graduation by one year). To prevent entering financial aid repayment, or \"grace period,\" a student may be able to register for six credits (half- time) of elective or required courses in the spring semester. Specific approval of this modified course plan must be obtained from the College's Office of Academic Affairs and the University's Office of Financial Aid A single course in each semester of the P-2 year may be repeated simultaneously with full time registration as a P-3 student. Approval must be obtained from the College's Office of Academic Affairs. A need to repeat two or more courses in either semester of the P-2 year may prevent simultaneous enrollment in any in either semester of the P-2 year may prevent simultaneous enrollment in any P-3 courses. Progression to the P-3 year will be delayed and graduation will be postponed by one year. Counseling with respect to financial aid considerations must be obtained. If a student earns less than a \"C\" grade in any single P-3 course in the fall semester, he or she may be permitted to continue enrollment in P-3 courses in the spring semester (subject to successful completion of required prerequisites). However, the student would not be able to complete any P-4 APPE until he or she has successfully completed all P-1, P-2, and P-3 courses, including Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPE), and the Top 300 Drug Review (PHAR 508). Assuming that all courses are passed successfully in the P-3 spring semester, a student would be able to begin APPE after repeating necessary fall courses. This would allow the student to begin APPE in January of the following year, possibly qualifying for graduation in December depending on available APPE sites. In order to forestall educational loan repayment, a student must enroll at least half-time (six credit hours) when repeating fall courses. If a student fails any P-3 courses in the spring semester, he or she will be prevented from starting his or her APPE until he or she has successfully repeated the courses the following spring. After the student has successfully completed the required courses, he or she may begin his or her APPE immediately subject to preceptor and site availability. If a student begins these experiences in March, he or she may be able to graduate in December. If the student begins in May, he or she cannot graduate until the following May (one year later). If a student fails any P-3 courses, any APPE schedule in place at that time will be entirely cancelled and re-scheduling of all APPE will be necessary (without exception). If a student fails one or more courses, IPPE or APPE rotations, it may be necessary to delay his or her graduation due to limited course offerings or unavailability of appropriate training sites. It currently is not possible for a student to complete a rotation during the months of May, August, or December and also graduate during that month because University graduation certification occurs in the middle of each month. Withdrawal A student may withdraw from a course without penalty at any time prior to the end of the fourth week of a semester. Withdrawal from a course after that period will result in a grade being assigned. Refer to the General Information section of this bulletin for detailed information about the withdrawal policy of the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences. Transfer Students CPHS does not accept transfer students directly into the doctor of pharmacy program. The College utilizes a process to evaluate potential students that may differ from other programs. In addition, there is a great deal of heterogeneity among doctor of pharmacy curricula across the nation. The scheduling difficulties for correcting potential course deficits become extremely complicated. Furthermore, the College could only consider such requests if space becomes available due to a decrease in the number of enrolled students; therefore, CPHS has determined that accepting transfer students with advanced standing is not in the best interest of the student nor the College. The College feels it would not be providing consistent opportunity for all students. As a result, students currently enrolled in a doctor of pharmacy program in the United States should apply to CPHS as an entry-level student. Interested individuals must follow the procedures for admission. Applicants must be in good academic standing and have a letter from the dean of their institution supporting the request. These admissions decisions will be handled in the same manner as all other applicants to the College by the actions of the Admissions Committee. Any individual admitted to CPHS who has completed coursework in another doctor of pharmacy program or another graduate/ professional degree may formally request transfer of credits. All accepted transfer students seeking \"advanced standing\" through the transfer of credits must submit a formal request as outlined in the policy and procedure for course transfer and waiver in the CPHS Academic Bulletin. All prerequisites must be met prior to matriculation to the doctor of pharmacy program at Campbell University. CPHS reserves the right to make changes in requirements for admission, curriculum, standards for progression, advancement and graduation, fees and rules and regulations To apply to the doctor of pharmacy program, please follow the policies and procedures in the admissions portion of the CPHS Academic Bulletin. Transfer Credit & Course Waiver Policy Students may formally request an evaluation of previously earned professional coursework for transfer credit or the waiver of course requirements of pre-professional and professional courses. Each course transferred or waived must be by written, affirmative acceptance of the associate dean for academic affairs. The process for transfer or course-waiver is not automatic. The review of transfer courses or course-waivers may only be initiated after a student has enrolled or been accepted for enrollment and paid the matriculation deposit for the doctor of pharmacy program. CPHS can only accept transfer of equivalent professional courses from an ACPE accredited institution. A student may transfer equivalent professional courses that meet the requirements of the curriculum.62 | 2016-2017 Academic Bulletin62 | 2016-2017 Academic BulletinTo be eligible for transfer and replacement of a course in the professional curriculum, the requested course for transfer must meet all of the following requirements: Be documented on an official transcript provided by the registrar of the accredited institution Have an earned grade of 70% or higher, or a grade of \"C\" or greater Be of the same general content and level of instruction as the equivalent course in the CPHS doctor of pharmacy curriculum at the time requesting transfer Be equal or greater in the number of semester credit hours as the course required in the CPHS professional curriculum. A student granted transfer credit will not be required to enroll or pay tuition and fees for the transferred course; however, full-time tuition is charged to all students enrolled in at least 12 semester hours. Upon approval for transfer, the student will be given credit for the transferred course on the official transcript. Credit hours for transferred courses that exceed the number of credits for the equivalent course at CPHS will not count towards elective credits in the curriculum. A student may formally request to receive a course-waiver for a required course in the doctor of pharmacy curriculum provided the student successfully completed an upper division or graduate course that: Is completed from an accredited institution recognized by CPHS Is documented on an official transcript provided by the registrar or equivalent of the accredited institution Has an earned grade of 80% or higher, or a grade of \"B\" or greater Be of the equivalent general content and level of instruction as the equivalent course in the CPHS doctor of pharmacy curriculum at the time of the request for waiver Be equal or greater in the number of semester credit hours as the course required in the CPHS doctor of pharmacy curriculum. A student granted a course-waiver would not be required to enroll in the equivalent professional course or be given degree program credit for the waived course. The student will be required to complete an equivalent number of semester credit hours in elective offerings to meet the total degree requirements for the doctor of pharmacy program.Procedure 1. An enrolled student or deposited applicant must present a signed letter to the associate dean of admissions & student affairs describing the course(s) in the professional curriculum that the student or applicant seeks to transfer or receive course-waiver. The following should be included with the letter: Documentation that the student or applicant has, before submitting the letter, made a request to the registrar of the previous institution to submit official documentation of the course(s) directly to CPHS, and has paid the appropriate fees, if any, to the previous institution to process the document Appropriate documentation to support the equivalence of the proposed transfer course or course- waiver as determined by CPHS. 2. Upon receipt of the letter and documentation, the associate dean of admissions & student affairs will determine the applicant's status for enrollment or acceptance to the doctor of pharmacy program and payment of the matriculation deposit. The associate dean of admissions & student affairs will communicate in writing the status of the application to the applicant, including any requirements that must be met by the applicant prior to processing the request. 3. The associate dean of admissions & student affairs will maintain the letter and documentation until such time as CPHS receives the official documentation from the previous institution(s). Upon receipt, the associate dean will transmit the request to the associate dean for academic affairs for evaluation and recommended disposition. 4. The associate dean for academic affairs will evaluate the transcript, course(s) and documentation submitted. If the associate dean for academic affairs has any question as to the equivalence of the course(s), he or she may contact the previous institution to secure additional information. If the associate dean for academic affairs determines that the submitted documentation is insufficient to determine equivalency, he or she may contact the applicant or previous institution to secure adequate documentation, or return the application to the applicant with an explanation of the required documentation to determine equivalence. 5. If the associate dean for academic affairs is not familiar with the content, he or she shall consult with the appropriate course director to determine course equivalency. 6. The associate dean for academic affairs shall make a recommendation to the dean whether to accept or deny the course transfer or course-waiver. 7. The associate dean for academic affairs shall make the final determination of the acceptance of the course transfer or waiver and communicate his or her decision in writing to the applicant and the Campbell University registrar. The decision of the dean shall be final. Grading System The following is the grading scales for the doctor of pharmacy program at CPHS with the assigned quality points: Grade Quality of Work 4-Pt. Scale A Superior/Excellent 4 B Above average 3 C Average 2 D Below average 1 F Failure 0 I Incomplete 0 IC Incomplete continued 0 AU Audit 0 P Passing (graduate only) 0 Grades of \"A, B, C, D, F, and I\" are included in semester hours attempted and will affect the grade point average. Grades of \"IC, AU, and P\" will not affect the grade point average. A grade of \"I\" must be removed by the completion of the work within 30 days after the opening of the next semester; otherwise, it will be recorded as an \"F.\" A grade of \"IC\" must be removed by the completion of the work within 120 days. A student may appeal a grade within a period of one academic year from the semester in which the grade was assigned. No changes to the transcript will be made after a 12-month period unless a professor acknowledges in writing that an error in grade reporting has occurred. Grade Reports, Records, and Transcripts A report of grades attained by a student in the CPHS will be available through the University's WebAccess system at the end of each semester. The official records of each student in CPHS will be maintained securely in the Office of the Registrar. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (PL93-380) will govern the release of information for this record which contains the transcript from Campbell University, transcripts and transcript evaluations from other educational agencies attended by the student, secondary school transcripts, scholastic aptitude, GRE, and other campbell.edu/cphs | 63 PHARMACY campbell.edu/cphs | 63 standardized test scores. The application for admission, general correspondence with the student and, if applicable, letters concerning misconduct or disciplinary actions at Campbell University are maintained by the Office of Admissions & Student Affairs within the university archival system. The transcript and contents of the permanent record may be examined by the student upon appointment with the Registrar, or the associate dean for student affairs. Matriculation Policies Students enrolled in the doctor of pharmacy program are required to fulfill the following: Submit the required non-refundable admissions deposit. Submit a signed honor code form indicating that the student has received, read, understands and agrees to adhere to the provisions of the honor code of the Campbell University College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences. Submit original transcripts from each college or university where any coursework was completed (undergraduate, graduate, professional, etc.) to the Office of Admissions & Student Affairs prior to the beginning of classes. It is strongly preferred that transcripts are sent at the end of each semester during the application process. Complete all prerequisite coursework prior to matriculation with official transcripts submitted as mentioned above. Complete the required vaccination and immunization requirements, including the Hepatitis A series, Hepatitis B series, varicella immunity, Tdap, IPV (polio), MMR, influenza, and a TB test. Students should note that the Hepatitis A series is delivered in two injections over a six month period and the Hepatitis B series is delivered in three injections over a six month period. Ideally while the Hepatitis A and B series should be completed by the first day of classes, students whose acceptance is not granted in a sufficient time to permit this, may complete the series during the first year providing they have started the immunization series. Students must maintain an up-to-date record of all required documentation (including, but not limited to: immunizations, HIPAA certification training, chest radiograph, emergency contact information, drug allergies, drug screen, and immunization certification) in Magnus. Submit to a criminal background check as described by the following procedure. CPHS applicants are required to self- disclose any misdemeanors and felony convictions, other than minor traffic violations, including deferred adjudications, with the understanding that non-disclosure or falsification may lead to dismissal and disclosure may prevent enrollment. Additionally, in response to requirements in the professional practice environment stating that facilities providing care to patients must minimize the risk to patients that may be presented by persons with prior criminal activity, a criminal background check will be completed on all accepted applicants prior to matriculation. Please refer to the General Information section at the back of this bulletin for the Criminal Background Check Policy. Submit to scheduled and random substance abuse screens each year as necessitated by the College and its affiliates. Attend all mandatory orientation sessions as applicable for new and returning students. Complete all programmatic standards as required by the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences.

Requirements for Pharmacy Internship Regulations regarding licensure internships require that the experience is obtained after acceptance to the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS). Information pertinent to internship licensing among the various states is available from CPHS. It should be noted that the CPHS experiential clerkship program will suffice for the internship requirement in North Carolina. Experiential Training Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences Student pharmacists complete introductory pharmacy practice experiences (IPPE) each summer between their academic semesters. Between the P-1 and P-2 years, students complete a one month community rotation and between the P-2 and P-3 years, they complete a one month hospital rotation. Students select their clinical rotation sites via a class lottery system or they may opt to work with the Office of Pharmacy Experiential Experiential Education (OPEE) to contract new rotation sites. Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences In the final year of the curriculum, P-4 students are divided into five geographic areas to complete nine required advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE). These regions include: Buies Creek/Fayetteville/Lumberton Greenville/Wilson/Rocky Mount Raleigh/Durham Wilmington Winston-Salem/GreensboroAfter geographical areas are established, students may enter preferences for clinical rotation sites and/or preceptors for each of the six required rotations. Once these preferences are entered, the OPEE uses an equitable placement process to assign students their APPE sites. Within the nine rotations, six rotations are required and three are electives. A lottery is held to assist students in selecting their three elective practice experiences. During experiential training, students are responsible for travel expenses and housing arrangements. In addition, incidental expenses such as parking at hospitals may be incurred. Information regarding expenses associated with each training site may be obtained from the OPEE. A fair and equitable lottery system is used when assigning both IPPE and APPE training sites; therefore, student pharmacists must be prepared to fulfill training requirements wherever they are assigned. Registration of Rotations and Billing Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences and Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences Student pharmacists that successfully complete all required prerequisite work in the first and second years will complete a one month (160 hour) introduction to community and introduction to hospital rotation, respectively. Students will earn either a grade of pass (P) or fail (F) in an IPPE. These rotations will be completed in either December (of the fall term) or in the summer term (May, June, or July). Student pharmacists will register for the IPPE in the term the rotation is completed and the earned grade will be recorded during the corresponding term. Students completing their IPPE during the summer term will not be charged any additional tuition beyond the fall and spring term for that year. Due to the Office of the Registrar's closing date for submission of fall grades (early to mid-December), students completing an IPPE in December will receive an incomplete (IC) recorded as their initial course grade. Once all rotation requirements are satisfied and the final grade is recorded in RxPreceptor, the OPEE will submit a Grade Change Form to the registrar's office. Student pharmacists completing their IPPE in the summer term will receive a grade during the same term. In the event that a student pharmacist cannot or elects not to complete the IPPE in either the summer term or in December following the first year, he/she must complete both IPPEs during the summer term following the second campbell.edu/cphs | 73 PHARMACY campbell.edu/cphs | 73 year or in December. If a student pharmacist receives a grade of Fail (F) on an IPPE, the grade will be submitted to the registrar's office and recorded on the student's transcript. The student will not be allowed to reschedule the failed rotation in the same term; therefore, the grade will remain on the transcript. If a student pharmacist is unsuccessful at either of the IPPEs, then he/she will be rescheduled for another introductory rotation of the same type either the following fall term (December), or the next summer term where applicable. The OPEE will communicate the IPPE schedule of all student pharmacists with the Office of Academic Affairs prior to the beginning of each term. The OPEE will submit grades for all IPPEs and APPEs. Student pharmacists successfully completing all required coursework in the preceding three years, including both IPPEs are classified as P4s and can register for their P4 rotations (APPEs). A minimum of nine rotations (1440 hours) in advanced community, ambulatory care, geriatrics, internal medicine I, internal medicine II, advanced hospital, and three electives is required. Grades for APPEs are recorded as A, B, C, or F (fail). Students usually complete their APPEs in May through April of the following year of expected graduation. All students will register according to his/her actual rotation schedule. Students will only be charged one program fee for the fourth year; one-half of the fee will be incurred in the fall term and the other half during the spring term. In the schedule below, the student below will be registered in the summer, fall, and spring terms; however, one-half of the program fee will be assessed in the fall and the other half in the spring. No program fee will be incurred in the summer. May Advanced community June Ambulatory care July Geriatrics August Off September Elective 1 October Advanced hospital November Elective 2 December Off January Internal medicine 1 February Internal medicine 2 March Off April Elective 3 Students registering for less than two APPEs in either the fall or spring term will be classified as a half-time student. The OPEE will communicate with the Office of Academic Affairs all student pharmacist APPE schedules prior to the beginning of each term and if/ when rescheduling becomes necessary. If a student pharmacist receives a grade of F in an APPE, the grade will be recorded on his/ her transcript; moreover, the student will not be rescheduled for the rotation again within the same term preventing grade replacement. APPEs are not completed in succession. If an APPE must be rescheduled for any reason (including but not limited to a rotation cancellation, rotation failure, course failure, not documenting all necessary requirements for site clearance, medical illness, etc.), the OPEE will make every effort to reschedule the rotation for the next semester or term; however, the OPEE implies no guarantee of on-time graduation if placement for a rotation is not available. If a student pharmacist's rotation cycle exceeds more than one calendar year (12 months) for any reason beyond OPEE's inability to find suitable placement, he/she will be responsible for the per credit hour cost of each rotation. If a student pharmacist's rotation cycle exceeds more than one calendar year (12 months) due to the OPEE's inability to find suitable placement, there will be no additional cost for the rotation. Once a student pharmacist begins his/her P4 rotations, all rotations must be completed within a two-year (24 month) time frame. If a student pharmacist is granted a leave of absence during the APPE cycle that exceeds two years (24 months), then all rotations from prior to the leave must be repeated. If a student pharmacist is granted a leave of absence during the APPE cycle that exceeds one year (12 months) he/she will automatically be referred to the Academic Performance and Standards Committee for recommendations regarding successful re-entry into the program. Clinical Rotation Sites Within the five geographic regions there are numerous affiliated training sites ranging from large tertiary care hospitals, such as Duke University Medical Center and Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center, to smaller community hospitals, chain and independent community pharmacies, and long-term care facilities.

Technical Standards for Admission In accordance with Section 504 of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the administration and faculty of Campbell Universities Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) program have established the essential non- academic functions for students to participate. The admissions committee will consider applicants who demonstrate the ability to perform, or learn, the essential skills listed in this document. Campbell University must confirm patients are not placed in danger by students with impaired intellectual, physical, or emotional functions. Students will be evaluated in all the areas listed below to meet requirements for admission, continuation, promotion, and graduation from the DPT program. The use of an intermediary, a person trained to perform essential skills on behalf of the student, is not permitted. Upon admission, a student who discloses in writing a properly certified disability may receive reasonable accommodation, however, he/she must be able to perform the essential functions within the curriculum and the described standards listed below. Formal disclosure should be made in the Office of Student Support Services, 227 Main Street, Buies Creek, North Carolina 27506. Candidates for admission to and matriculation from the Campbell DPT program should possess, at a minimum, the following abilities: Behavioral/Social Skills and Professionalism Students in the Campbell University DPT program must demonstrate attributes of empathy, compassion, integrity, collegiality, high moral character, excellent interpersonal communication, listening, and self-motivation, as such qualities are assessed throughout the program. Students must exhibit sound judgment in the care of patients and academic inquiry along with developing appropriate and effective patient relations. Flexibility and cultural sensitivity must be ensured during times of indecision as these occur frequently in clinical and academic settings. Additionally, students must be able to function in a collegial environment demonstrating proper levels of assertiveness, task delegation, along with organization and time management skills. Adequate emotional health is necessary to deal with strenuous environments and work effectively in demanding situations. Students must maintain good general health, self- care, and hygiene throughout the program and agree to abide by the American Physical Therapy Associations code of ethics and professional behavior. Intellectual/Conceptual, Integrative, and Qualitative Skills Students in the Campbell University DPT program must demonstrate the ability to utilize computer technology. Students must be able to interpret and comprehend three- dimensional and spatial relationships of body structures. Proper reasoning requires students to measure, calculate, analyze, and synthesize information pertinent to problem solving and establishing a PT diagnosis. The aforementioned skills allow students to create proper assessments and sound judgment necessary for correct decisions in rehabilitative intervention and documentation of patient outcomes. Recognize the impact of disability and dysfunction while integrating the needs of patient/family into the plan of care. Communication Skills Students in the Campbell University DPT program must be able communicate and comprehend the English language in written, oral, and electronic forms with faculty and classmates in academic settings along with members of health care team and patients in clinical/professional settings. Examples of communications skills may include speaking, writing, hearing, and reading. The ability to elicit information regarding mood/affect, alertness, activity, movement, function, and non-verbal behavior are essential. Sensory/Observational Skills Students in the Campbell University DPT program must be able to observe cadaveric dissection, wounds, burns, pelvis and perineum and other potentially unsettling tasks throughout the curriculum. Students must be able to observe patients to obtain a history directly from the patient or guardian. Such observation requires use of vision, hearing, and other somatosensory modalities. Motor Skills Students in the Campbell University DPT program must demonstrate adequate strength and endurance along with fine and gross motor skills to perform frequent lifting, twisting, bending, kneeling, pushing/ pulling necessary with patient transfers, gait, assessment, and intervention. The ability to safely assist patients with ambulatory activities and stand for prolonged periods of time is essential. Candidates must have sufficient manual dexterity to write, type, grasp, pinch, hold, push, pull, lift, and palpate. Students must be able to ensure patient safety at all times. Students must be able to successfully perform dissection, debridement, auscultation, percussion, and wound/burn management along with performance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of an automated external defibrillator (AED). These actions require coordination of many sensory systems (vision, hearing, equilibrium, touch). Academic Standards Reports on academic performance and progress are generated at the mid-term and completion of each semester. The DPT program core faculty meets at the end of each academic term, or as necessary, to discuss the academic performance of all students. Any discussions regarding type of academic deficiency and remedy occurs with development of an action plan (if remediation is required; see below for remediation process) and draft of a letter from the program director stating the specific academic standing described in the following sections. The letter will be provided to the student via email and hard copy by mail. The letter will contain the following: Description of academic standing (remediation, probation, suspension, dismissal) Rationale for academic standing Criteria required to regain good academic standing Contact information of the program director to discuss items outlined in the letter Notification of appeals process Core faculty is actively involved in promoting student retention through annual advisement sessions. A modified generic abilities document will be used to guide the process. Advisement can occur more frequently (e.g. professionalism, behavioral, or academic concerns) should the need arise. Mechanisms are in place to encourage students to seek assistance for academic performance using StarFish and ExamSoft programs. Retention and Promotion Criteria Full-time students enrolled in the doctor campbell.edu/cphs | 81 campbell.edu/cphs | 81 of physical therapy program at the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS) are expected to make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of the degree requirements. Satisfactory academic progress is defined as successful completion of didactic and experiential training in the prescribed time and maintenance of a 2.8 cumulative grade point average (GPA). Students who fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress in the professional program are automatically placed on academic probation. They may be required to participate in academic counseling, be enrolled in a remedial program of study, or suspended/ dismissed according to the policies described in subsequent sections. Students, who fail to maintain good academic standing at the completion of a semester prior to a semester requiring a clinical internship, may not be allowed to participate in the clinical education portion of that semester. The student would need to undergo a remedial course of study, with successful completion, prior to engaging in the internships (DPT 800, 802, 804). In the event remediation is not successful, students cannot progress to the clinical internship. Such actions will be recommended by the DPT Academic Performance & Standards committee and program director, with notification to the Associate dean for academic affairs. The student will be notified of these actions by the director of the DPT program. Students may need to take leave from the DPT program for non-academic reasons considered and approved by the program director on a case-by-case basis (e.g. medical illness, financial, etc). Should a student be unable to attend classes for 2 consecutive weeks for a reason approved by the program director, disengagement from the program will be necessary. Should absence occur during clinical internships, see policies in Clinical Education Manual. The length of disengagement and any requirements for reengagement will be outlined in a letter from the program director along with a face-to-face meeting. The length of disengagement cannot be greater than 3 consecutive semesters. The following contains a description of the types of academic standing within the DPT program: 1. Good Academic Standing Students will be considered in good academic standing providing: Cumulative GPA 2.8 Passing grades for all clinical/experiential training No violations of student honor code or code of conduct have occurred.2. Remediation Students who fail to meet academic standards within a given course or clinical/experiential rotation may be required to remediate coursework and/or attend another clinical/ experiential training. Students will require remediation for any patient safety issue throughout the curriculum. Students must initiate remediation should a grade of < 70% or failure on any examination within a given course. The content of remediation will be directed by the course instructor within a week of receiving a grade. Successful remediation of a practical exam must occur in the provided time and only a single attempt is allowed. If the student is not successful he/she may be placed on academic probation or suspension. Should a student fail to remediate academic performance, or there are any behavioral and/or non- academic reasons preventing them from participating in regularly scheduled clinical experience or internship, this rotation must be remediated prior to graduation from the program. Should a student fail a clinical/experiential rotation, this rotation must be remediated prior to graduation from the program. In most cases, this will need to be completed at the end of the program thereby increasing the length of the program for students in this situation. With fixed date licensure testing, students in this situation may fall out of sequence and will not be able to sit for the licensure examination for several months after graduation. Upon successful completion, the student will graduate assuming all didactic courses have been completed. See Graduation after Deceleration policy. If the student is unable to successfully pass a clinical/experiential rotation/internship during the program, the student will be out of sequence in the didactic portion and may require temporary disengagement from the program (necessitating placement on academic suspension) until rejoining in the normal curriculum sequence. A student failing more than one clinical/experiential rotation will be dismissed from the program. 3. Academic Probation Academic probation is the initial action for a student failing to make satisfactory academic progress. A student will be placed on academic probation for: Failure to maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.8 A grade of D in any single course Failure to complete any degree requirement at the prescribed time without prior approvalDepending on the nature of the academic deficiencies and overall academic record, a student placed on academic probation may or may not be permitted to continue in the regular sequence of the professional curriculum. Students cannot be on academic probation more than two times throughout the program and may not be on probation for more than 2 consecutive semesters. Students who fail to complete the criteria for lifting academic probation will be considered for suspension or dismissal from the DPT program. The core DPT Academic Performance & Standards committee and director will review the student's record each semester and again at the end of the term of probation. A recommendation will be made to the program director to restore good academic standing if: 1. The cumulative GPA returns to 2.8 or above within 2 consecutive semesters of being placed on probation, the student will be released from academic probation. 2. Successfully completed a deficient clinical/ experiential training and recommendation for a return term/year for the program A recommendation will be made to the program director to suspend/dismiss if while on academic probation: 1. A student makes a \"D\" or below in any course. 2. A student fails to correct academic deficiencies within the prescribed time. 4. Academic Suspension Academic Suspension from the DPT program and CPHS occurs when a student: Has failed to make satisfactory progress as demonstrated by a cumulative GPA less than 2.80, or received a grade of \"D\" in any course during a period of academic probation. Has academic deficiencies which preclude continuation in a normal program of study, but may be expected to be able to complete the requirements for the degree under a modified program of study with or without remedial courses; Suspensions are imposed for a specified period of time and must not exceed one year. A student on academic suspension is not allowed to continue the standard course of study. The DPT program director will specify the length of time of the suspension, remedial work required for reinstatement, and the program of study required upon re-instatement in consultation with the DPT Academic Performance & Standards committee. The CPHS Associate dean for academic affairs may PHYSICAL THERAPY82 | 2016-2017 Academic Bulletin82 | 2016-2017 Academic Bulletinbe consulted as needed. 5. Academic Dismissal Academic dismissal from the DPT program and CPHS may be recommended to the Associate dean for academic affairs by the director of the DPT program and DPT Academic Performance and Standards Committee if a student: Makes a F in a single course Fails to make satisfactory progress during a period of academic probation or suspension; Has an academic deficiency which precludes continuation in the prescribed program of study, and may not reasonably be expected to complete the requirements of the degree. A student dismissed from the College may seek re-entry by applying for re-admission using the standard admissions process. Academic Status Appeals At the end of each academic term, the DPT director will notify the DPT Academic Performance and Standards Committee of all students enrolled in DPT program that qualify for academic probation, suspension, or dismissal. The DPT program director notifies each student who does not meet the academic standards as defined by the academic regulations at CPHS. The College's associate dean for academic affairs is also notified for any student at risk of suspension/dismissal. Each student subject to suspension or dismissal (as recommended by DPT core faculty and program director) is evaluated by the DPT Academic Performance and Standards Committee in order to make a recommendation whether to retain or promote the student in the professional program. The student may appear in person before the committee. The DPT program director notifies students in writing regarding any decision by the committee to require a modified course of study, to suspend enrollment, or to dismiss the student from the College and informs associate dean for academic affairs and associate dean of admissions & student affairs. Students have the opportunity to appeal any decision made by the DPT Academic Performance and Standards Committee by submitting a written petition to the associate dean for academic affairs within seven days of their receipt of notification. The petition must contain the specific variance requested, a description of any extenuating circumstances intended to justify granting the variance, and a proposed course of study and/or conditions for consideration should the variance be granted. The decision of the associate dean for academic affairs is final. Time to Complete the Program Students have up to 150% of the total normal program length or 13 semesters to complete the DPT program. Approved medical leave and academic deficiencies (e.g. suspension) count toward the total time clock. Should a student take longer than that amount of time to complete the program, additional studies or repeating of semesters may be required to ensure competency in content knowledge and skills. Delayed Graduation Policy If a Physical Therapy student is required to re-take classes as a result of specific course failure or a deficiency in overall academic performance, then a delay in scheduling Physical Therapy clinical experiences or matriculation through the curriculum will occur and the student's graduation may be delayed. Voluntary course withdrawals or a temporary leave of absence may cause a delay in scheduling Physical Therapy clinical experiences, progress through the curriculum, and a subsequent delay in graduation. Any alteration in the normal curriculum progression may affect a student's financial aid status or qualification for education-based financial aid. For specific counseling and advice, students should contact the College's Office of Academic Affairs and the University's Office of Financial Aid. Graduation Requirements Recommendation for graduation requires faculty approval and attainment of the following requirements: Successful completion of all courses, requirements, and remediation Successful completion of all clinical/ experiential training Attendance of graduation week activities that includes licensure preparation courses and comprehensive curriculum review Attendance at the graduation ceremony is expected Graduation after Deceleration DPT students who decelerate due to approved medical leave, and are in good academic standing, may walk at the graduation ceremony with their original cohort if they lack no more than six hours of credit (one clinical rotation). The missing credit must be completed no later than March 15 of the original graduation date. Students who lack more than six hours of credit will walk at the next graduation ceremony after completion of their outstanding requirements. Students who decelerate will receive their degree at the next University awarding period; either the May, August, or December graduation dates. Students may not sit for their FSBPT licensure examination until after the degree has been awarded. With fixed date testing, the FSBPT application is due at least 6 weeks prior to testing date. See https://www. fsbpt.org/ForCandidatesAndLicensees/NPTE/ FixedDateTestingInfo/index.asp for available testing dates. Employment while in the Program Outside employment during the DPT program is strongly discouraged. Required program activities cannot be altered. Outside obligations cannot interfere or impede class attendance or completion of assignments and program requirements. Students must not substitute for faculty or staff by performing any administrative, clerical, or clinical duties while on supervised clinical experiences. Transfer Students CPHS DPT does not accept transfer students directly into the DPT program. Students currently enrolled in another DPT program in the United States seeking admission into the Campbell DPT program will be asked to apply. Interested individuals must follow the procedures for admission. Applicants must be in good academic standing and have a letter from the dean of their institution supporting the request. These admissions decisions will be handled in the same manner as all other applicants to the College by the actions of the Admissions Committee. All prerequisites must be met prior to matriculation to the DPT program at Campbell University. CPHS reserves the right to make changes in requirements for admission, curriculum, standards for progression, advancement and graduation, fees and rules and regulations. To apply to the DPT program, please follow the policies and procedures in the admissions portion of the CPHS Academic Bulletin.campbell.edu/cphs | 83 campbell.edu/cphs | 83 Grading System The following arbitrary grading scale is utilized for the DPT program: Grade A 90-100 B 80-89.99 C 70-79.99 D 60-69.99 F 59.99 or below P Pass NP No Pass I Incomplete Grades of \"A, B, C, D, F, and W\" are included in semester hours attempted and will affect the grade point average. Grades of \"P , I, and NP\" will not affect the grade point average. A student may appeal a grade within a period of one semester from the semester in which the grade was assigned. No changes to the transcript will be made after a semester period unless a professor acknowledges in writing that an error in grade reporting has occurred. An instructor or director initiated inquiry/request will be remediated and corrected at any time.Curriculum Campbell University's Doctor of Physical Therapy Program is a 36 month graduate degree program with 26.5 months of didactic education and 9.5 months of supervised clinical internships. Graduates will receive the Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) degree upon successful completion. There is a one-week summative session before graduation. The program starts in January with graduation in December. Most didactic courses are held on the main campus with an online licensure preparation course completed while on clinical internships in the final year of study. The DPT program curriculum is a competency-based graduate education (minimum required skills for physical therapist education and normative model of PT education) curriculum based on a hybrid model pulling from traditional, lifespan, and problem based learning. The sequence of courses is designed to start with foundation courses in the basic sciences, professional development, and early clinical skills. Following the initial foundational coursework, subsequent courses teach clinical assessment and intervention, medical, surgical and pharmacy concepts in patient management from a population based lifespan perspective. Integrated curricular themes in service-learning and early clinical experiences, therapeutic exercise, and approach to patient care using a lifespan model is designed to enhance student learning and promote confidence in application of skills and didactic knowledge. Clinical reasoning courses are designed to enhance student interaction through problem-based learning, application of concepts/skills, and critical interpretation of evidence. The integrated service learning and clinical experiences are designed to encourage inter-professional interaction and collaboration. Assessment of students in the didactic/classroom years is by written examinations, performance on laboratory practical examinations, OSCE, reflective narrative, professional portfolio, and participation in small group activities. Three clinical rotations occur throughout the curriculum with a six-week introductory internship in the spring of the second year. The remaining clinical internships occur in the third program year with durations of 16 weeks each for a total of 38 weeks of clinical training. Students complete clinical experiences and service learning in rural locations with most completing a clinical internship in a rural location. Clinical internships can be completed in an acute/subacute, neuromuscular, musculoskeletal, general practice, and specialty settings. Specialized settings may include burn/wound care, aquatic, industrial/ vocational, and VA/military locations, home health, and school systems. Evaluation of clinical-year students includes a preceptor and student self-assessment of student performance using the clinical performance instrument (CPI), reflective narratives on patient care experience/delivery, case study presentations, and written examinations to prepare for licensure. All students complete all didactic elements in the program at the same time. All students complete the required clinical experiences. The only elective study available in this curriculum is spring semester of the third year. Please visit www.campbell.edu/pt for the most up-to-date curriculum information.

Because these standards describe essential functions that students must demonstrate to meet the requirements of PA education, they are prerequisites for entrance, continuation, promotion, and graduation from the PA program. The use of an intermediary, a person trained to perform essential skills on behalf of the student, is not permitted. The following technical standards are adapted from the AAMC guidelines. Candidates for admission to and graduation from the Campbell PA Program should possess the following abilities: Observation The candidate must be able to observe required demonstrations and experiments in the basic sciences, including but not limited to anatomic dissection, microscopic studies, and patient demonstrations. A candidate must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the sense of vision, hearing, and somatic sensation. Communication A candidate must be able to speak, to hear, and to observe patients in order to elicit information, describe changes in mood, activity, and posture, and perceive non-verbal communication. A candidate must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients. Communication includes not only speech, but also reading and writing in English. The candidate must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in oral and written form with all members of the health care team. Motor Abilities A candidate must have sufficient motor function to carry out basic laboratory techniques; elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion, and other diagnostic maneuvers; perform dissection of 94 | 2016-2017 Academic Bulletin94 | 2016-2017 Academic Bulletina human cadaver and have sufficient motor ability to use a microscope. A candidate should be able to perform a complete physical examination (including pelvic and rectal examination) and diagnostic procedures (e.g., venipuncture and basic laboratory tests such as urinalysis). A candidate must be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients. Examples of treatment reasonably required of PAs are cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the administration of intravenous medication, the application of pressure to stop bleeding, the suturing of simple wounds, assisting in surgical operations, and the performance of simple, general obstetrical and gynecological procedures. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium and functional use of the senses of touch, vision, and hearing. Intellectual, Conceptual, Integrative, and Quantitative Abilities Problem solving, the critical skill demanded of PAs, requires that a candidate be able to learn, retrieve, analyze sequence, organize, synthesize and integrate information efficiently, and reason effectively. In addition, a candidate should possess the ability to measure and calculate accurately, perceive three-dimensional relationships and understand the spatial relationships of structures. Behavioral and Social Attributes A candidate must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of his or her intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients, and the development of mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients and their family members, staff, and colleagues. Each candidate must be able to work effectively as a member of a health care team. Candidates must be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. They must be able to adapt to changing environments, display flexibility and learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, collegiality, interest, and motivation are all personal qualities that are assessed during the admission and education processes. Disclaimer: Accepted students with a disability who believe they may require special accommodations should contact the Director of Access & Outreach immediately upon accepting the offer of admissions and before matriculation. Before matriculation, accepted students must attest in writing that they have read and are able to meet the program's technical standards. Academic Standards PA Academic Performance and Standards Committee The Academic Performance and Standard Committee (APSC) of the Campbell University Physician Assistant program consists of the principal faculty: the program director (chair), medical director, academic coordinators, clinical coordinators, and general faculty members. The committee meets at the end of each block and semester to review the academic standing of each student. Prior to the end of the didactic year the APSC convenes to recommend students for advancement to the clinical year; it convenes again prior to the end of the clinical phase to recommend students for graduation. The committee will also be convened at any point in the program at the recommendation of a faculty member to discuss a student whose performance is at risk for not meeting standards. Retention and Promotion Criteria Students enrolled in the Physician Assistant program are expected to make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of degree requirements. Satisfactory academic progress is defined as successful completion of all required courses and completion of all deficiencies and/or required remedial programs in the time and manner prescribed by the Physician Assistant program faculty. Students who fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress will be placed on academic probation. Students on academic probation will be required to participate in academic counseling and/or in a remedial program of study, as determined by the student's advisor, with input from the academic/ clinical teams. Didactic Remediation Students having academic difficulty can request tutoring by contacting the Coordinator for Academic Support Services. There is no fee for this service. The number to call is 910-814- 5693. Advisors may refer students for tutoring as part of a remediation plan. 1. Didactic Exam Remediation Each student is required to have a satisfactory understanding of all course material presented during the program in order to be a competent clinician. A student who fails an exam with a grade of less than 70% will meet with his/ her faculty advisor and/or course coordinator, as directed by the academic coordinator. The meeting should include a review of the student's study habits. The student must complete a written or practical remedial exam within two weeks, to ensure content competency. The completed remedial exercise will be placed in the student's file. The exam grade will not be changed. In the event that a student fails 4 or more exams in any one block the APSC will convene to discuss whether, and under what conditions, a student can continue in the program. 2. Unit Remediation Clinical Medicine I, II, III and IV courses are composed of several units. Each unit has one or more exams. If a student receives a failing unit grade s/he must meet with his or her advisor. The student must successfully pass a remedial written or practical exam within two weeks of unit failure. If the student successfully remediates the unit, the grade will remain unchanged and the student will be placed on academic probation. If the student fails to successfully remediate the material s/ he will be dismissed from the program. Failure of any third unit during the didactic year is not remediable and will result in dismissal from the program. 3. Course Remediation Students must successfully complete all required courses of the Physician Assistant program with a minimum grade of 70%. A student who fails any one course will be placed on academic probation. The student will be given one opportunity to remediate the course. The student must successfully pass a remedial written or practical exam within two weeks in order to continue in the program. After successful remediation the course grade will be advanced to 70%. Failure to successfully remediate the course in the prescribed manner and time will result in dismissal from the program. Failure of any second course during the didactic year is not remediable and will result in dismissal from the program. Remediation Records A record of all student remediation exercises will be kept in the student's file. A record of remediation for each semester is kept in a flow sheet in the program files. Academic Probation Academic probation is the initial action for a campbell.edu/cphs | 95 campbell.edu/cphs | 95 PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT PROGRAMstudent failing to make satisfactory academic progress. A student will be placed on academic probation for: 1. Failure to successfully remediate a unit in which he or she received a grade of less than 70%, or 2. Failure of one didactic course with a grade of less than 70%, but which was successfully remediated. A student placed on academic probation will be on probation for the remainder of the didactic year. A didactic year student on probation will be required to meet with his/her advisor to develop a remedial study plan. The advisor may recommend referral to student services for advising and tutoring, restricting participation in non-academic clubs and committees, or a combination of interventions. Administrative Probation Regardless of academic standing, a didactic phase or clinical phase student may be placed on administrative probation at any time for unprofessional behavior or activity. Students on administrative probation will be required to engage in counseling as determined by the APSC and sign a probation contract. Counseling must be satisfactorily completed, as determined by the APSC, in order for the student to remain in the program. Students will remain on administrative probation for the remainder of the program. A didactic phase or clinical phase student will be placed on administrative probation for: 1. Failure to demonstrate appropriate professional attitudes and behaviors, or 2. Documented behaviors that would preclude professional licensure. Academic or administrative probation, counseling, and remediation are not to be viewed as punitive, but as a means to help the student succeed. These measures are instituted in recognition that, given the responsibilities of a health care professional, it is untenable for the program to advance a student who is not performing at a satisfactory level. Academic Dismissal Students will be dismissed from the Physician Assistant program for the following: 1. Failure to successfully remediate an initial course failure, in which the student received a grade of less than 70%, 2. Failure of a second course, or 3. Failure of a second unit.Students who are dismissed from the program have three (3) business days to appeal the decision to the associate dean for academic affairs. The associate dean will review the case within seven (7) business days and deliver a decision. The decision of the associate dean for academic affairs is final. Students who are dismissed must return the program provided laptop, iPad mini, identification card, name tags, and the Campbell logo patch. Administrative Dismissal A student on administrative probation who fails to comply with the terms of the probation, or who repeatedly demonstrates unprofessional behavior will, upon recommendation of the APSC, be presented to the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee or the Campbell University Behavioral Intervention Team, as appropriate. After discussion of the circumstances for probation and potential dismissal, the Committee or Team will either recommend further investigation and/or counseling, or uphold the recommendation for dismissal. Students who are dismissed from the program have three (3) business days to appeal the decision to the associate dean the associate dean for admissions and student affairs. The associate dean will review the case within seven (7) business days and deliver a decision. The decision of the associate dean for admissions and student affairs is final. Students who are dismissed must return the program provided laptop, iPad mini, identification card, name tags, and the Campbell logo patch. Clinical Year Remediation End-of-Rotation Exam Remediation: The final grade for clinical rotations is a combination of end-of-rotation (EOR) exam grades, preceptor evaluation, written assignments, and the professionalism evaluation, as outlined in the course syllabus. Failure of any EOR exam, with a score of less than 65%, must be successfully remediated with a written exam and assignment. The grade earned on the initial EOR exam will be the grade used to calculate the final course grade. If a student does not successfully remediate a failed EOR exam, s/he will fail the rotation and be placed on academic probation. Failure of the rotation results in deceleration, delayed graduation, and additional tuition and fees. Failure to successfully remediate a second EOR exam failure will result in dismissal from the program.Students may successfully remediate up to two failed EOR exams, without being placed on academic probation. Failure of a third EOR exam will result in academic probation and evaluation by the PA Academic Performance & Standards Committee. The committee will review each student's overall academic performance on an individual basis to determine whether deceleration with delayed graduation is in the student's best interest. Failure of a fourth EOR exam will result in the student being evaluated by the PA Academic Performance & Standards Committee. The committee will review the student's overall academic performance to determine whether, and under what conditions, the student may continue in the program. Preceptor Evaluation Clinical preceptor grades are an integral part of assessment of clinical year students. Clinical year students who receive a failing grade from a preceptor on any rotation may be placed on probation, after review of the situation by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee (APSC). If failure by the preceptor is upheld by the APSC, the student will receive a failure for the rotation. If the first failure was upheld, students who receive a failing grade from a second preceptor evaluation will be brought before the APSC. The APSC will evaluate the specific circumstances of each preceptor evaluation. If the APSC decides that the evaluations are evidence that the student is unprepared for the rigors of clinical practice, the student will be dismissed from the program. Course Remediation: Failure of a clinical rotation with a grade of less than 70% requires repeating the rotation and the student will be put on academic probation. Mandatory repeating of the clinical rotation will result in delay of graduation from the program. The student will incur additional tuition costs for the repeat rotation. Failure of a second clinical rotation is evidence that the student is unprepared for the rigors of clinical practice and will result in dismissal of the student from the program. Clinical Year Probation Clinical year students on probation will be required to meet with their advisor to develop a comprehensive written remedial study plan to assure comprehension of the core material. Students will be placed on academic probation for: 1. Failing to successfully remediate an end-of- rotation exam failure, or 2. Failing a clinical rotation with a grade 96 | 2016-2017 Academic Bulletin96 | 2016-2017 Academic Bulletinof less than 70%., but was successfully remediated, or. 3. Failing a preceptor evaluation for any rotation, upon recommendation of the APSC. 4. Failure of a third EOR exam. Clinical Year Dismissal Clinical students will be dismissed from the Physician Assistant program for the following: 1. Failure of a second clinical rotation, 2. Failure of two preceptor evaluations, following review by, and on the recommendation of the APSC. 3. Failure to complete and/or respond to required counseling as a result of administrative probation. Academic Status Appeals Any student in the Physician Assistant program has the opportunity to appeal any decision made by the APSC. Students desiring to appeal a decision rendered by the APSC must submit a written petition to the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences' associate dean for academic affairs within seven days of the student's receipt of notification of the APSC decision. The decision of the associate dean is final. Grade Appeals Students who feel that they have a just reason for appealing a grade in a Department of Physician Assistant Practice course must first appeal to the course coordinator. If no resolution is achieved at the level of the course coordinator a student may appeal to the program director within seven days of notification of the grade. If the student feels the program director's resolution is not just, the student must submit a written petition to the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences' associate dean for academic affairs within seven days of the student's receipt of notification of the program director's decision. The petition must contain the specific variance requested and a description of any extenuating circumstances intended to justify granting the variance. The decision of the associate dean is final. Test Question Appeal Students who contest the answer to a test question may appeal to the course coordinator, within three days of the exam grade being posted. The appeal must be accompanied by at least two peer-reviewed references. The decision of the course coordinator is final.Service Hours Service to the program, college, university, community, and profession is an integral part of the Campbell mission of faith, learning, and service. Physician Assistant students are required to earn 25 service-learning hours, during the first year of study, as part of the didactic curriculum. Service hours can be earned by participating in college health fairs, the Buies Creek Elementary school health fair, PA day activities, the annual Charity Golf Tournament, adopt-a-highway program, and serving as hosts during open houses or Marshalls at graduation, among other activities. Students may also submit verified hours from service to their local churches or community groups. In addition to all other components required for successful completion of the didactic year, completion of the 25 mandatory service hours must be accomplished by the end of the Clinical Year Orientation week each year in order to advance to the clinical year and begin rotations. Failure to complete the hours as required may delay graduation. Advancement to the Clinical Year Advancement to the clinical year requires faculty approval and attainment of the following requirements: 1. Successful completion of all courses, 2. Maintenance of a 70% or greater overall grade average, 3. Successful completion of the didactic year summative evaluations, and 4. Completion of 25 hours of required service learning. Graduation Requirements Recommendation for graduation requires faculty approval and attainment of the following requirements: 1. Successful completion of all courses, requirements, and remediation, 2. Successful completion of the Campbell PA program PANCE board review seminar, and 3. Successful completion of all summative clinical year evaluations. Graduation after Deceleration PA Students who decelerate due to probation, repeating a clinical rotation, or approved medical leave, and are in good academic standing, may walk at the graduation ceremony with their original cohort if they lack no more than five hours of credit (one clinical rotation). The outstanding credit must be completed no later than 6 weeks immediately following the original graduation date. Students who lack more than five hours of credit, or miss the deadline for completion, will be able to walk at the next graduation ceremony after completion of their outstanding requirements. Students who decelerate will receive their degree at the next University awarding period; either the December, May, or August graduation dates. Students may sit for their NCCPA boards and apply for North Carolina licensure once all program requirements have been met, and the program director releases their names to the appropriate boards. All academic, clinical, and remedial work must be completed within three years of matriculating in the PA program. Students who have outstanding work after three years may reapply for admission, as described under the academic dismissal policy. Employment while in the Program 1. Outside employment during the didactic or clinical phases of the PA program is strongly discouraged. 2. Required program activities cannot be altered by outside activities. Outside obligations cannot interfere or impede class attendance or completion of assignments or program requirements. 3. Students are not permitted to perform any clerical, administrative, or physical work for the PA program or be employed as a graduate assistant. 4. Students must not substitute for faculty or staff by performing any administrative, clerical, or clinical duties while on supervised clinical educational rotations. Assignment Completion All course assignments must be turned in by the date and time posted by the instructor. A late penalty of 5-points per day will deducted from the assignment grade. Unless specific reasons for late submissions are approved in advance by the instructor, an assignment that is more than 6 days late will not be accepted and the student will receive a zero for the assignment. Exam Protocol - Late for an Exam It is unacceptable to be late for an exam as it is disruptive for the rest of the class. Students must be in their seats and have their computers set up before the posted exam time (usually on the hour). Students who are late for an exam must not enter the exam room; those students must report to the PA office suite. They will be set up in a location provided by faculty, or other proctors who may be campbell.edu/cphs | 97 campbell.edu/cphs | 97 PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT PROGRAMavailable. For a first offense the earned grade will be awarded. For any subsequent exam tardiness, students up to 15 minutes late will receive a 10% reduction in grade for the exam. Students more than 15 minutes late (usually 15 minutes after the hour) will not be allowed to take the exam and will receive a zero for the exam. For extenuating circumstances - car problems, road conditions, acute illness, or other instances beyond the student's control - the student must notify their advisor or the course coordinator by email, text, or phone as soon as possible. Program faculty will decide whether a make-up exam will be permissible. Medical Leave-of-Absence Students who require a medical leave-of- absence must request a meeting with the program director. The circumstances of the leave will be reviewed with the Academic Performance and Standards Committee. Each case will be considered on an individual basis. A plan for deceleration, remediation, or withdrawal will be developed in discussion with the associate dean for Admissions and Student Services. Student withdrawal will follow the \"Withdrawal\" protocol in the general section of this bulletin. Students returning after a medical leave-of- absence must obtain a medical clearance letter clearing them for return to the program. Honor Code Refer to the General Information section of this Academic Bulletin for the Honor Code. PA students are required to read and sign the Honor Code, attesting they understand the code, they have read and understand the bulletin, and will adhere to the policies. A signed copy of the code will be kept in the student's file.98 | 2016-2017 Academic Bulletin98 | 2016-2017 Academic BulletinCurriculum The Campbell PA program is 24 months long. The graduate degree program consists of 12 months of didactic education and 12 months of supervised clinical experiential education. Graduates will receive the Master of Physician Assistant Practice (MPAP) degree upon successful completion of the program. The program starts in July, with graduation after six semesters of training, also in July. All didactic courses are held on the health sciences campus in Lillington, NC. The PA program curriculum is a competency-based graduate medical education curriculum. The sequence of courses is designed to start with foundation courses in the basic sciences as well as clinical skills. Following the initial foundational coursework, subsequent courses teach clinical medicine, surgery, and pharmacotherapeutic concepts. Curriculum content is vertically integrated such that the study of topics in a specific clinical discipline, such as cardiology, includes cardiac history and physical exam, cardiology in clinical medicine, cardiology diagnostics such as EKG and appropriate laboratories, and cardiology pharmacotherapeutics. The Clinical Skills Courses will compliment this integrated curriculum through regular exercises in critical thinking such as clinical case studies, simulation activities and objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs). Early clinical experience opportunities are also interspersed throughout the didactic year. Assessment of students in the first year is by written examinations, performance on laboratory practical examinations, and participation in small group activities as well as final summative exams. All students complete all didactic elements in the program at the same time. All students must complete all required clinical experiences. The only elective study available in this curriculum is in the second year when students may undertake supervised clinical experiences in two four-week rotations of their choosing. Curriculum design and operationalization is guided by the standards of accreditation for physician assistant education, as published by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC- PA). The ARC-PA accreditation standards describe the required curricular components and required supervised clinical experiences for a program to receive accreditation. The curriculum described was designed to meet these accreditation requirements.Clinical Education Clinical rotations in the second year consist of four-week supervised clerkship experiences in the major disciplines, a seminar in evidence- based medicine and two clinical electives. Evaluation of clinical-year students includes a preceptor assessment of performance, and student performance on written examinations or presentations given at the end of each required clinical rotation. There are final summative exams at the conclusion of the clinical year which are prerequisites for graduation. Didactic Courses Block 1 Block 2 Block 3 Block 4 Block 5 Clinical Rotations Clinical Affiliation There are numerous clinical affiliations for PA students to complete their supervised clinical training. Students will be notified of their clinical training sites during the spring/ summer semester of the didactic year. Those sites are located predominately in Harnett and surrounding counties in North Carolina. Clinical Rotations at Distant Sites While many clinical educational rotations are in Harnett and surrounding counties, it may be necessary for the program to arrange some rotations at distant sites. Every effort will be made to arrange clinical rotations that are within 90 minutes' drive time from campus, Courses MPAP 501 - Anatomy MPAP 502 - Physiology MPAP 511 - Genetics MPAP 512 - History & Physical MPAP 519 - Health Policy TotalCredit Hours 4 3 1 3 1 12 Courses MPAP 505 - Clinical Medicine II Cardiology Hematology/Oncology Gastroenterology MPAP II MPAP 521 - Surgery MPAP 523 - Clinical Skills II TotalCredit Hours 4 1.5 2 3 3 13.5Courses MPAP 504 - Clinical Medicine I Prevention & Nutrition Infectious Disease ENT Pulmonology MPAP 522 - Clinical Skills I MPAP 515 - Pharmacology I MPAP 503 - Behavioral Medicine TotalCredit Hours 4 2 2 3 11Courses MPAP 506 - Clinical Medicine III Endocrinology Nephrology/Urology 517 - Pharmacology III MPAP 524 - Clinical Skills III TotalCredit Hours 4 1.5 2 2 3 12.5 Courses MPAP 526 - Clinical Medicine IV Dermatology Pediatrics Neurology Geriatrics MPAP 527 - Pharmacology IV MPAP 510 - Emergency Medicine MPAP 524 - Clinical Skills IV TotalCredit Hours 4 2 2 3 11 Courses MPAP 601 - Emergency Medicine MPAP 602 - Family Practice MPAP 603 - Internal Medicine MPAP 604 - Surgery MPAP 605 - Pediatrics MPAP 606 - Psychiatry MPAP 607 - OB/GYN MPAP 608 - Primary Care MPAP 609 - Evidence-Based Med.

Travel expenses are the student's responsibility. Nevertheless, there are times when it may be necessary for the program to send some students to sites that are not within convenient driving distance. In those few instances the program will arrange for suitable housing; however, students will be responsible for travel and housing costs. Students may qualify for discounted housing rates that the program may arrange if available through North Carolina AHEC. Distant rotations will account for no more than three of any student's total rotations Course Descriptions Didactic Courses MPAP 501 - Human Anatomy Credit: 4 hours Human Anatomy prepares the student for clinical practice with an understanding of functional human anatomy.
