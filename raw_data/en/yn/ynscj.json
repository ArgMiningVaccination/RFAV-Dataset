Due to its low degree of differentiation, rapid proliferation, and strong invasiveness, comprehensive treatment such as surgical resection combined with chemoradiotherapy is dif cult to change its malignant progression. However, temozolomide is the only rst-line chemotherapy drug that can pass the blood -cerebrospinal fluid barrier and has been used so far,1so, the prognosis of GBM is extremely poor. The median survival time of high-grade GBM after standardized treat- ment is only 14.6 months,2and the 5-year survival rate is still less than 10%. Along with the pancreatic cancer, it is a kind of malignant tumor which is most dif cult to cure.3The diagnosis of GBM relies on neuroimaging and tissue biopsy.Although some recent studies have proposed some diagnos- tic markers for the diagnosis and judgment of prognosis of GBM, such as tenascin C, nestin, vascular current status of the dif culty in treatment and poor prognosis is still gloomy. The Chinese herb Yadanzi ( Brucea javanica ) is the dried and mature fruit of Brassica chinensis , which is bitter and cold in nature, with the effects of killing parasites and relieving dysentery, ghting against malaria and tumor.7,8In 1978, China began to develop Yadanzi ( Brucea javanica )o i li n t r a - venous emulsion to treat various ) oil emulsion widely used in the adjuvant treatment of GBM,10,11which has the effect of enhancing ef cacy and reducing toxicity. Although the curative effect of Yadanzi (Brucea javanica ) oil emulsion in the treatment of GBM is relatively de nite, the composition of Yadanzi ( Brucea jav- anica ) is complex, and the molecular mechanism of anti- GBM needs further exploration. Now data mining and inte-gration can quickly and effectively screen differentially expressed genes between tumor tissue and normal tissue, and at the same time, clinical data can be used to obtain therelationship between target gene expression levels and patient 's survival prognosis, which will help provide impor- tant clinical evidence for nding reliable therapeutic targets and prognostic indicators and will open up new horizons for studying the progression and recurrence of GBM after the treatment. Due to the complex composition of Chinese herb, multiple pathways, and multiple targets of its action, it is relatively difcult to clarify the material basis and action mechanism. In this study, the methods of bioinformatics and network pharmacology were used to screen out the biomarkers that may be involved in the malignant progression of GBM fromthe Gene Expression Pro ling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database. 12Survival analysis was performed on the core genes. Meanwhile, the active ingredients and targets ofYadanzi ( Brucea javanica ) were obtained by screening with the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP), and they mappedandve action targets of -sitosterol (BS) and luteolin were found, and the targets were mainly concentrated in BS. It was found by KEGG pathway enrichment analysis thatGBM differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in signaling pathways relatedtoStaphylococcus aureus infection, phagosome formation, tuberculosis and systemic lupus erythematosus and other infectious and autoimmune diseases. It was found by GO enrichment analysis that the GBM differentially expressed genes mainly involved such biological processes (BP) as the pr ocessing and presentation of exogenous antigenic peptides and matrix composition, and chemical synapses transmission; it involved cellular components such as cell junctions, axonterminal buttons, extracellular space, vesicle membranes for endocytosis, uch as calcium-mediated ionic protein binding, MHC II molecular receptor activity , immunoglobulin binding, and phospholi- pase inhibitor activity were also involved. Survival analysis was conducted by GEPIA on the top 37 core targets in degree value, and a total of ve genes related to GBM prognosis were obtained. Among them, FN1 and MMP2 were highly expressed while GABRD (-aminobutyric acid A receptor delta subunit) , RBFOX1 ,a n d SLC6A7 were expressed at a low level in cancer patients.Conclusion The pathogenesis of GBM is closely related to the human immune system, and BS and luteolin may be the main material basis of Yadanzi ( Brucea javanica )f o rt h e treatment of GBM and the improvement of prognosis. The molecular mechanism may be related to the physical barrier formed by destroying the tumor cell stromal molecules and its involvement in tumor immune response.

Materials and Methods Screening and Target Prediction of Active Ingredients of Yadanzi ( Brucea javanica ) The TCMSP database was con- stituents of Yadanzi ( Brucea javanica ). Taking oral bioavail- ability (OB) and drug likeness (DL)13as parameters, the active ingredients that met the condition of both OB /C2130% and DL /C210.18 and the active ingredients reported in the literature were screened out. The TCMSP target prediction model was used to predict the targets of the active ingredients. Select the cancer type \"GBM \"in the GEPIA database, set \"ANOVA, \"set the gene distribution as \"Both, \"and search for reported genes associated with GBM. thecomponents 'targets of Yadanzi ( Brucea javanica ) were mapped to each other, and the intersection targets were obtained, which were the main targets of Yadanzi ( Brucea javanica ) in the treatment of GBM. the main targets of Yadanzi ( Brucea javanica ) in the treatment of GBM were corrected and uni ed by using the UniProt (http:// www.uniprot.org/) database. Construction of Protein Interaction Network Import the GBM differentially expressed gene targets into the String database (https://string-db.org/Version 10.5),14 limit the study species to human, obtain the protein interac- tion relationship, save it in TSV format, and import the le into Cytoscape software to draw the protein interaction network, further use Cytobba and MCODE plug-ins to screen core genes, and obtain important modules of protein inter- action network and protein interaction relationship. Gene Ontology (GO) Biological Function Enrichment Analysis and KEGG Signaling Pathway EnrichmentAnalysis The retrieved GBM differentially expressed genes were imported into the DAVID database for functional annotation,and the species was limited to human. The differentially expressed genes were subjected to GO biological function enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes andGenomes (KEGG) signaling pathway enrichment analysis. Omic- Share (http://www.omicsshare.com) online software was used to draw the advanced bubble chart of KEGG signaling pathway.Set the threshold p<0.05, and screen the top 15 pathways for enrichment; the results of GO biological function enrichment analysis were sorted using Cytoscape according to the numberof targets involved, and the bar graphs of BP, cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF) were drawn. Survival Analysis Survival analysis was performed on the core genes using GEPIA database, and the log value and risk ratio of 95%condence interval were calculated and displayed in a prognostic map. p<0.05 was considered statistically signicant. The GEPIA database was used to verify the expression levels of prognosis-related genes, and at least one \"/C3\"(p<0.05) was considered statistically signi cant. Construction of \"Active Ingredient-Action Target \" Network Cytoscape 3.6.1 software was used to build the relationship network model of \"active ingredient-action target. \"The nodes represented the potential active po-tential targets of Yadanzi ( Brucea javanica ). The edge was used to connect the active ingredients and the action targets, showing the connection between the active ingredients andthe action targets. Based on the constructed network, the main constituents and key action targets of Yadanzi ( Brucea javanica ) in the treatment of GBM were discussed. Results Screening of Active Ingredients of Yadanzi ( Brucea javanica ) Through database retrieval and literature review, a total of 67 chemical constituents of Yadanzi ( Brucea javanica )w e r e collected, and 23 potential active constituents were obtained through further screening by OB /C2130% and DL /C210.1815and literature research15-18(Table 1 ). Targets of ( Brucea javanica ) in the the GEPIA database, 247 GBM differentially expressed genes were screened, including upregulated genes(Log2FC and 134 downregulated genes (Log2FC <0). Through the TCMSP database, 129 targets related to the potential active ingredients of Yadanzi ( Brucea javanica ) were obtained. After mapping the 247 differentially expressed genes with 129 targets related to active ingre-dients of Yadanzi ( Brucea javanica ), six potential targets obtained, namely An target \"network was con- structed by using Cytoscape software. The network graph has eight nodes and 13 edges, of which the green diamondsrepresent two active ingredients, namely -sitosterol (BS) and luteolin; the red circles represent six targets, which are mainly concentrated on BS, indicating that -sitosterol may be the main material basis for the treatment of GBM by Yadanzi ( Brucea javanica )( Fig. 2 ). Construction and Analysis of Protein Interaction Network The screened 247 GBM differentially expressed genes were entered into the String database, the specie was selected as \"homo sapiens, \"the TSV le was exported, and the Cytoscape software was used to obtain the interaction network Chinese Medicine and Natural Products Vol. 2 No. 2/2022 \u00a9 2022. The Author(s).Treatment Network Pharmacology Zhao,Si. e69 between the targets. A total of 207 valid nodes and 1,477 edges were obtained. Cytobba plugin was used to draw nodes with different shades of color according to the degree valueof the nodes. The redder the color is, the greater the degree value and the more complex the protein interaction are. Then the MCODE plugin was applied to further analyze and obtainthree core modules ( Figs. 3 and 4). GO Biological Function Enrichment Analysis and KEGG Signaling Pathway Enrichment Analysis GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were performed on 247 effectively differentiallyexpressed genes in GBM through the DAVID website. Set the threshold value p<0.05, screen the top 15 pathways, and use the OmicShare (http://www.omicsshare.com) onlinesoftware to draw a high-level bubble chart of the KEGG pathway. The larger the point is, the more enriched the genes are. The smaller the p-value is, the redder the color is, indicating the closer the relationship with the incidence of GBM. The results of pathway analysis indicated that the differentially expressed genes in GBM mainly involved sig-naling pathways such as Staphylococcus aureus infection, phagosome formation, tuberculosis, systemic lupus eryth-ematosus, and other infectious and autoimmune disease- related signaling pathways. Bar graphs of GO enrichment analysis results were drawn by using Cytoscape. GO enrich-ment analysis showed that GBM differentially expressed genes mainly involved the biological processes such as processing and presentation of exogenous antigenic peptidesand composition, and chemical synapses transmission; it in-volved the CCs such as cell junctions, axon terminal buttons, extracellular space, vesicle membranes for endocytosis, and the MFs such ascalcium-mediated ionic protein binding, MHC II molecular immunoglobulin binding, and phospholi- pase inhibitor activity ( Figs. 5 and 6). Correlation Analysis of Core Target Prognosis Survival analysis was conducted by using GEPIA on the top 37 core targets in degree value, a total of ve genes related to GBM prognosis were obtained ( p<0.05), namely bronectin RBFOX1, SLC6A7 , and the gene levels were negatively correlated with prognosis. The GEPIA data- base gene expression box plot was further used to verify thatcompared with healthy people. FN1 and MMP2 were highly expressed while the GABRD, RBFOX1 and SLC6A7 were expressed at a low level in cancer patients ( Figs. 7 and 8). Discussion GBM is the most common primary central nervous system tumor. Due to the existence of tumor stem cells with self- renewal ability in the brain,16glioma has its own special microenvironment.17The invasive growth is strong, and the existence of the blood -brain barrier affects the tumor 's response to external apoptosis signals. Based on this, to prevent the recurrence of GBM and prolong the survival period of patients, a comprehensive treatment of surgerycombined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy is generally advocated. Although immunological methods such as im- mune checkpoint inhibitors, individualized peptide vaccines,and viral therapy have emerged in recent years for the treatment of GBM, 1,18the action mechanism, inoculation doses, and inoculation methods have not yet been uni ed, and thus it still cannot bene t the majority of glioma patients. Therefore, patients with GBM have a poor progno- sis. At present, it is believed that changing the tumormicroenvironment and anti-t umor immun otherapy malignant GBM. 1 The inhibition of the immune system by malignant GBM is not only localized to the tumor, but also spreads throughout the system.1This study found that GBM differentially expressed genes mainly involved Staphylococcus aureus in- fection, phagosome formation, tuberculosis and systemic lupus erythematosus and other infectious and autoimmune disease-related signaling pathways, and were also associatedTable 1 Information table of potential active ingredients of Yadanzi ( Brucea javanica ) No. 0.41 Chinese V ol. 2 No. 2/2022 \u00a9 2022.

It also involved the CCs and MFs of the human body involved in the immune process, such as the MHC II protein complex and its molecu- lar receptor activity. The results of the study further illus-trated that the occurrence and development of GBM were closely related to the immune system. Survival analysis of differentially expressed core genes found that FN1, MMP2, RBFOX1, GABRD ,a n d SLC6A7 were associated GBM prognosis. As glycoprotein, FN1are involved in cell adhesion and migration of various tumor cells, they are considered as the important regulators for the formation, development, and signal transduction of the cancer cells in the lung cancer,ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. 19-27 Currently, FN1 has been used as a marker to detect epitheli- al-mesenchymal transition. Recent studies have found that gliomas can form vascular morphology rich in tumor extra- cellular matrix. This structure, called vasculogenic mimicry, enables gliomas to obtain blood supply and promotes gliomainvasion and migration. 28Several studies suggested that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) might destroy the physi- cal barrier formed by tumor cell matrix molecules, stimulatepotential biological activities in the human body, and partic- ipate in the immune response of tumors, and the expressions of MMP1, MMP2, and MMP9 in the intracranial tumor wereespecially more pronounced. 29,30The protein encoded by RBFOX1 can participate in cell architecture, cell deformation, and cell migration by regulating actin, kinesin, and microtu-bule-binding proteins. 31Studies showed that RBFOX1 was also a tissue-speci c selective splicing gene in malignant glioma, which can control cell migration by affecting clathrin Fig. 1 Potential targets of Yadanzi ( in the treatment of GBM. glioblastoma.

Studies have shown that this gene may be asusceptibility gene for asthma. 35Prognosis-related genes suggested that regulating immunity and changing the tumor microenvironment were essential entry points to improvethe prognosis of GBM. In this study, it was found that BS and luteolin were the main components in the treatment of GBM by constructingan\"active ingredient-action target \"network. BS is widely present in various drugs and plants, and is the most abun- dant phytosterol. It has strong anticancer activity and caninhibit multiple cell signaling pathways such as tumor cell proliferation, metastasis, invasion, peripheral angiogenesis and in flammation, and can be used to treat various tumors such as lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and coloncancer. 1,36 -38Luteolin is a flavonoid present in natural plants. Studies reported that luteolin had inhibitory effects on the proliferation of various tumor cells such in the postoperative adjuvant treatment ofneuroglioma, the main anti-tumor component of Yadanzi (Brucea javanica ) emulsion has been reported to be fatty acid. 43There are few studies on the anti-neuroglioma BS and Fig. 5 KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes in GBM.

The Author(s).Treatment o n g which MMP2 is associated with the prognosis of GBM, suggest- ing that Yadanzi ( Brucea javanica ) the expression of MMP2 by regulating related pathways, affect the blood supply of gliomas, inhibit the invasion and migration of gliomas, destroy the physical barrier formed by tumor cellmatrix molecules, and participate in the immune response of tumors, thereby improving the prognosis of GBM patients. In this study, the key differentially expressed genes, molecular mechanism, and prognosis-related genes of GBM were screened and analyzed based on bioinformatics methods. At the same time, the active ingredients and keytargets of Yadanzi ( Brucea javanica ) were studied in the treatment of GBM by applying network pharmacology. The results of the study suggested that the pathogenesis of GBMwas closely related to the human immune system. Mean- while, it was found that BS and luteolin may be the main material basis for the treatment of GBM and the improve-ment of the prognosis in the Yadanzi ( Brucea javanica )o i l emulsion besides fatty acid. This study provides a basis for the molecular mechanism study of the etiology and progno-sis of GBM, and also provides a theoretical basis for further exploring the pharmacological effects of Yadanzi ( Data collection and curation, formal analy- sis, software, and writing original draft.
