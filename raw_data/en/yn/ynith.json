Ask what your patients have heard from friends and family or on social media. Let them know that it's easy to be confused by all the information that is circulating, some of which may be conflicting. You can find responses to these myths at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/about-vaccines/ vaccine-myths.html or azhealth.gov/covid19vaccinesIt's important to know: COVID-19 vaccines will not give you COVID-19 None of the COVID-19 vaccines currently in development in the U.S. use the live virus that causes COVID-19. Symptoms such as fever may occur, but these symptoms are normal and are a sign that the body is building immunity. FDA and CDC will continue to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines to identify all side effects, including those that are rare. People who have gotten sick with COVID-19 may still benefit from getting vaccinated Due to the severe health risks associated with COVID-19 and the fact that re-infection is possible, people may be advised to get a vaccine even if they have been sick with COVID-19 before. Natural immunity varies from person to person, and at this time experts do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. Some early evidence suggests natural immunity may not last very long. Getting vaccinated can help prevent getting sick with COVID-19 There is no way for patients to know how COVID-19 will affect the body, even when not at increased risk of severe complications. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect by creating an antibody response without having to experience sickness. COVID-19 vaccines will not cause you to test positive on COVID-19 viral tests* Vaccines currently in clinical trials in the U.S. will not cause a positive result on viral tests. Viral tests are used to check for current infection. There is a possibility to test positive on some antibody (serology) tests which are used to check for previous infection. Receiving an mRNA vaccine will not alter your DNA COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have been rigorously tested for safety before being authorized for use in the U.S. The mRNA from a COVID-19 vaccine does not enter the nucleus of the cell, which is where DNA is kept. This means the mRNA does not affect or interact with DNA in any way. Instead, COVID-19 vaccines that use mRNA work with the body's natural defenses to safely develop protection (immunity) to disease.ADDRESS MISINFORMATION ABOUT COVID-19 VACCINATION BY SHARING KEY FACTS Use the below conversation as a chance to address misinformation by sharing key facts with your patients.
