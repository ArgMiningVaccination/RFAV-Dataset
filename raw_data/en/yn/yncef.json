During 2005-2010, our aims are: Advancing knowledge: To support research to increase understanding of health and disease, and its societal context Using knowledge: To support the development and use of knowledge to create health benefit Engaging society: To engage with society to foster an informed climatewithin which biomedical research can flourishDeveloping people: To foster a research community and individualresearchers who can contribute to theadvancement and use of knowledge Facilitating research: To promote the best conditions for research and theuse of knowledge Developing our organisation: To use our resources efficiently and effectively.A YEAR OF DISCOVERY It has been a year that demonstrates that investing in the best people to work on the best ideas in the best environments produceslandmark discoveries. One of the greatest satisfactions of directing the Wellcome Trust is seeing the many discoveriesemerging from the research wefund. The most effective way tofund the research that leads to new discoveries is to support thebest researchers, the best teamsand the best ideas. To help guideour research communities andprovide them with the opportunitiesto make real progress, this year we launched our Strategic Plan 2005-2010: Making a Difference . The new Plan is about creating a framework (see page 36), a set of high-level principles to guide - but notconstrain - research communities thatlook to us for funding. The Strategic Planwill be a living document, allowing us toadjust our direction as new opportunitiesarise. Key to this will be flexibility in ourmechanisms for awarding grants. Thisyear we launched a Strategic Awardsscheme, with grants that will enable usto fund strategic initiatives of many kindsin a timely manner. We also broadenedour UK eligibility criteria, so that we canfund the best scientists throughout theUK and enable them to collaborate withscientists worldwide. Discoveries Support of curiosity-driven researchremains the biggest single element of ourfunding portfolio. Such support has ledto some outstanding research outputs -discoveries that give us a betterunderstanding of health and disease.Last year Dr Georgy Koentges and colleagues made ground-breaking steps forward in the understanding ofhow our skeletons and muscles develop,and why certain genetic disorders affectparticular parts of our bodies. This hassignificantly altered our view of a keybiological process, as has the work ofProfessor Adrian Hayday and colleaguesat King's College London. They havediscovered that immature T cells have a crucial role in generating specialdefence cells that patrol the vulnerablesites exposed to the outside world, suchas skin and the gut. This has created anew view of the thymus function. In the clinical arena, this year saw the results of the largest-ever clinical trial on the treatment of severe malaria. Thiswork in South-east Asia, led by ProfessorNick White, brought calls for immediatechange to medication practices. In Vietnam, Dr Jeremy Farrar and colleagues have advanced ourunderstanding of avian influenza inhumans. Their research suggests thatthe virus can affect many parts of thebody - not just the lungs, as previouslythought. The core funding of the VietnamProgramme and our other MajorOverseas Programmes in Kenya andThailand was renewed this year. Fundingof \u00a326 million was agreed in recognitionof the internationally important workthese Programmes are carrying out. In the UK, researchers working with ALSPAC, a cohort study of 14 000children born in the Avon area in1991-92 and their parents, which we fund jointly with the Medical ResearchCouncil, continue to produce important findings. Research resources The year also saw the fruit of severallarge international collaborative projects,in which the Trust is a major partner.These build on the Human GenomeProject, aiming to translate genomesequence data to give a betterunderstanding of health and disease. The International HapMap Consortium published a detailed catalogue of human genetic variation, which isalready accelerating the search forgenes involved in common diseases.The Wellcome Trust Sanger Instituteplayed a key role in generating this map. In another outstanding year, the SangerInstitute took a key role in internationalpartnerships that sequenced thegenomes of parasites causing threemajor diseases in developing countries -sleeping sickness, Chagas' disease and leishmaniasis - and the human X chromosome. Knowing the shape of a protein is crucial for understanding its biologicalfunction, and the Structural GenomicsConsortium (SGC), a public-privatepartnership between the Wellcome Trust,GlaxoSmithKline, and funding agenciesin Canada and Sweden, is determiningthe three-dimensional structures ofproteins relevant to human disease. The SGC has, to date, solved thestructures of over 100 complex proteins, DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT 02DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT 03 HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR Artesunate is more effective than quinine for treatment of severemalaria, a large clinical trial inAsia reveals. Genome sequences of two important parasites,Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania , are published. Building work is completed on the National Science LearningCentre at York. Community MRSA is identified as a re-emergent strain from the 1950s. Work on early T-cell development sheds new light on the thymus.

Bacterial illness is found to account for an unexpectedly highproportion of deaths of Africanchildren admitted to hospital. An influential report on neglected diseases highlights the importantrole of public-privatepartnerships. New estimates suggest that the global prevalence of malaria is farhigher than previously thought,particularly in Asia. More than 120 000 visitors attend the Future Face exhibition at the Science Museum. including important drug development targets for malaria and diabetes. These are tremendous research resources, all freely available toresearchers around the globe. Last year we also agreed to fundanother such community resource.The Wellcome Trust Case ControlConsortium will be one of the biggestprojects ever undertaken to identify the genetic variations that maypredispose people to, or protect them from, 11 major diseases,including type 1 diabetes, Crohn'sdisease and rheumatoid arthritis. Practical application Key to our mission is ensuring thatresearch knowledge results in healthbenefit. CardioDigital Limited, a spin-out company from Napier University,Edinburgh, has developed and ispiloting software that can significantlyenhance the information extracted from existing medical hardware, such as pulse oximeters. Professor Steve Howdle, Professor Vladimir Popov and colleagues havedeveloped 'PolyHap' implants, whichhave been used by surgeons to helprebuild the faces of children injured inaccidents or born with serious defects.This has already benefited a baby witha jaw tumour and a 12-year-old girlwho had been barely able to open her mouth from birth. Dr Mary Moran at the London School of Economics and Political Sciencepublished an excellent analysis showingthat public-private partnerships (PPPs)have performed better than eithersector working alone when it comes to delivering safe, effective, affordabledrugs for neglected diseases. We awarded one such non-profit PPP , the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), \u00a310 million in funding -matched by the UK Department forInternational Development. MMV runs the world's largest dedicatedprogramme of antimalarial drugresearch and development.A supportive environment To achieve our mission, we need a climate within which biomedicalresearch can flourish. The Trust has again been active in this area. The completion of the National Science Learning Centre is an important stepforward. It will provide teachers andother educators with access to theresources and expertise to get to gripswith the complexities of contemporaryscience. In turn, teachers will go on to inspire today's young people tobecome the scientists of tomorrow, and give them the confidence tounderstand, debate and questionissues surrounding science. This year we have again been actively engaging with Government, policymakers and opinion formers on issuesaffecting the research base. Theseinclude stem cell research, use ofhuman tissues, career structures forclinical and basic scientists, andcontinuing professional developmentfor science teachers. We have alsoactively promoted the 'open access'model of science publishing, to helpensure that research findings areshared as widely and as rapidly as possible. As this Annual Review illustrates, our funding portfolio is a treasure trove of stories of discovery. Capturing thesestories systematically is not easy, andunderstanding the longer-term impactsof research is particularly difficult. Theresearch process is incremental, andthe road from discovery to applicationcan be long and complex. We plan to develop new ways to capture thediverse outputs and outcomes of ourmany awards. Through this approachwe hope to gain a better picture ofhow, through the work of our manydedicated grantholders, we are trulymaking a difference.

Influenza virus attached to cells in the upperrespiratory tract.L-RADVANCING KNOWLEDGE Supporting research to increase understanding of health and disease, and its societal context.The Blimp1 gene has been identified as a key factor in the development of mouse germcells (eggs and sperm). It appearsto act by preventing primordialgerm cells from following adevelopmental path that turnsthem into body cells. Germ cells are special. While other cells of the body last no longer thanthe lifetime of an organism, germ cells,uniquely, have the potential to seed thenext generation. In mice, the cells thatwill generate germ cells are specified in early development, in response to asignal that about 40 cells receive fromtheir neighbours. Two research groupshave identified the Blimp1 gene as an important part of this key cellulardecision-making mechanism. A critical step in this process is the repression of a developmentalprogramme followed by all other bodycells (somatic cells). Dr Azim Suraniand colleagues in Cambridge, and DrElizabeth Robertson and colleagues inOxford, independently discovered that FRUIT-FLY DIETS AND LONGEVITY Experiments on fruit flies suggest that what is eaten, rather than just how much, influences lifespan.ADVANCING KNOWLEDGE 06 GERM OF AN IDEA Cut down a fruit fly's diet to half of its normal calories, and theaverage lifespan almost doubles.Similar effects are seen in a widerange of organisms, from yeast to mice, but it has been thoughtthat it was calorie reduction ingeneral, rather than the specificsource of calories, that increases longevity. Professor Linda Partridge and colleagues at University CollegeLondon have now found that, percalorie, different constituents of the diet have very different effects on lifespan, implying that the linksbetween calorie restriction andlongevity may be more complex than once thought. In the lab, Drosophila are fed on a diet of yeast (contributing a mixture ofnutrients including protein and fat) andsugar (carbohydrates), which provideroughly the same number of caloriesper gram. The researchers could therefore feed the flies on a yeast-restricted diet or a sugar-restricted diet with the same number of calories,and compare the effects on lifespan.They found that reducing either dietaryyeast or sugar could reduce mortalityand extend lifespan, but by an amountthat was unrelated to the caloriecontent of the food - and yeast had a much greater effect per calorie thandid sugar. For fruit flies at least, the research suggests that it is not simply calorieintake that influences longevity, butalso the specific nutritional make-up of the food. In which case, ProfessorPartridge and colleagues suggest, the full effect of dietary restriction onlifespan could be obtained by reducingcritical nutrients in the food withoutreducing overall calorie intake. Mair W et al. Calories do not explain extension of life span by dietary restriction in Drosophila.PLoS Biol 2005;3(7):e223.

In the past, the skeleton has been thought to be the basis of organisationin vertebrates, with distinct types ofstem cell giving rise to the skeleton and muscles in separate processes. Using a new genetic labelling technique able to track individual stem cells fromthe embryo to the adult animal, Dr Georgy Koentges from UCL, andcolleagues in Sweden and the USA,found that mesenchymal stem cellswere responsible for forming musclescaffolds, the place where musclesanchor to bones, as well as themuscles themselves. The work paints a completely new picture of vertebrate development. For example, cells derived from mesenchymal stem cells in the neuralcrest (a structure formed very early inembryonic development) anchor thehead to the front of the shoulder. Aseparate population, originating frommesodermal stem cells, links trunkmuscles to the posterior neck andshoulder skeleton. These new findings explain why some genetic disorders affect particularparts of the neck and shoulders: themutations affect specific populations of cells. They also shed light on theevolution of skeletons - for example,suggesting that a bone called thecleithrum, seen in extinct land animals,has become integrated into theshoulder blade in modern vertebrates. Matsuoka T et al. Neural crest origins of the neck and shoulder. Nature 2005;436(7049):347-55. This research was supported by the Wellcome Trust, the Biotechnology and Biological SciencesResearch Council, the Medical Research Council,the US National Institutes of Health and theinternational Human Frontier Science Program. Skeletal and muscle components of the shoulder and neck are formed together, and are derived from one type of stem cell. the Blimp1 gene is central to this repression. In the absence of Blimp1 , cells that resemble germ cells developbut do not follow the usual germ celldevelopment pathway, and eventuallyturn into somatic cells. Dr Robertson's team studied the role of Blimp1 in knockout mice, which, as well as having other defects, areentirely lacking germ cell precursors.Dr Surani's team also noted disruptionto germ cell development in mutantmice. In addition, they used cell-labelling techniques to confirm thatcells making Blimp1 in normal embryos are those that turn into germ cells. The research thus provides important insight into a fundamental biologicalpuzzle: development of the cells thatperpetuate a species' existence. Ohinata Y et al.

According to the popular saying, difficult tasks are like banging yourhead against a brick wall: it's nicewhen you stop. A team led by RayDolan at the Wellcome Departmentof Imaging Neuroscience atUniversity College London havenow found, using brain imaging,why this is so. The new research suggests that the brain treats relief from pain and naturalreward in a similar way. In addition,people suffering prolonged pain can'learn' to predict relief, something thatcould affect how they deal with pain inthe future. The group tested the effect of Pavlovian conditioning - where an arbitrary cuebecomes associated with a painfulstimulus, so eventually the cue triggersa response even without the stimulus.They exposed people to prolongedpain (tolerable to the subjects) andthen, after a visual cue, gave them either pain relief, extra pain or nothing. Half the time, though, the cue was false, so subjects constantly had toupdate their expectations of what wascoming next. Using brain imaging, theresearchers could then see what effectexpectation of pain relief had, evenwhen it didn't actually occur. The expectation of relief activated reward-like pathways in the amygdalaand midbrain, while 'aversive' signalswere activated in the brainwhen the relief failed to materialise. Unravelling how psychological phenomena affect brain activity couldbe useful in creating more effectivepain relief or techniques to managechronic pain. Seymour B et al. Opponent appetitive-aversive neural processes underlie predictive learning ofpain relief. Nat Neurosci 2005;8(9):1234-40.Professor Adrian Hayday and colleagues at King's CollegeLondon have found thatdevelopment of different kinds of T cell in the thymus is moreclosely linked than previouslythought. The findings shed newlight on key aspects of immune-cell development. The thymus, a gland found overlying the heart, is where the immunesystem's T cells develop. Two maintypes of T cell exist, and ; broadly speaking, cells circulate in the bloodstream tackling a diverse rangeof microbes, while cells patrol the body's boundaries with the outsideworld, such as the skin and gut. One of the most striking features of the thymus is the large number of T cells it generates, most of which areeliminated. Immature T cells - knownas DP or 'double-positive' cells as theyNICE WHEN YOU STOP Relief and reward are all the same to the human brain.ADVANCING KNOWLEDGE 08 THINK POSITIVE New research is changing our understanding of T-celldevelopment in the thymus. The experience of pain can be influencedby other forms of brainactivity. Functional magnetic resonance imaging gives insight into areas of brain activity.A section through the thymus, a gland crucialto the development ofour immune defences. A cell in culture engineered to makemelanopsin, whichmakes it light-sensitive. Cells in the retina stained to show the presence ofmelanopsin.L-R ADVANCING KNOWLEDGE 09 SEEING THE LIGHT Professor Mark Hankins and colleagues at Imperial CollegeLondon and the University ofManchester have shown thatmelanopsin, a protein present inganglion cells in the eye, is able to make mouse cells sensitive to light. Melanopsin works in a similar way to invertebratephotoreceptors, promptingquestions about how ganglioncells evolved. For a while it has been clear that a light-sensing system exists in the eye,separate from the rod and cone cellsneeded for vision. A small number ofnon-vision ganglion cells at the back of the eye respond to light and arerequired for setting the body's internalclock (its circadian rhythms). The retinal ganglion cells contain melanopsin, which has the hallmarks of a light-sensitive protein. To see ifmelanopsin could make cellsresponsive to light, Professor Hankins and colleagues inserted the gene formelanopsin into cultured mouse cells.The modified cells expressed theprotein and generated electriccurrents when illuminated, confirmingthat melanopsin is a genuinephotoreceptor protein. The induced currents were dependent on the presence of particular forms ofretinaldehyde, a chemical needed forlight detection in the rods and cones.As with these photoreceptors,melanopsin requires cis-isomers of retinaldehyde to function. However,there was also some light-sensitivitywhen all- trans -retinaldehyde was added, suggesting that melanopsin is able to convert it into the 11- cis form - something seen only ininvertebrates before.

A chemical found in the human eye can render mammalian cells sensitive to light. produce two key T-cell surface molecules - proliferate, but only thosedeemed to be of potential value in thefight against infection go on to laterdevelopmental stages. In their latest research, Professor Hayday and colleagues discovered that this multitude of DP cells are notsimply passively waiting to be chosenor culled: they also have a specific role of their own. The DP cells releasefactors (such as lymphotoxin) that acton neighbouring immature T cells,pushing them towards a T-cell fate. Thus, as well as generating the T cells, these DP precursors also ensurethat T cells are produced - so the body has a balance between these two types of defence cell. Silva-Santos B et al.

A study in Vietnam suggests that the H5N1 strain of avian influenzavirus can affect the brain andcentral nervous system beforerespiratory problems appear. Asantiviral agents are likely to workonly early in disease, this couldhave important implications foravian flu treatment. In February 2004, in Dong Thap Province in southern Vietnam, a sisterand brother aged nine and four diedwithin two weeks of each other. Both children arrived in hospital having had fever, diarrhoea andincreasing drowsiness for several days.In hospital, they went into coma anddied. Respiratory symptoms appearedonly during the last day of their lives. In both cases, acute encephalitis (brain inflammation) was reported as the cause of death. However, because the boy was included in an ongoing research study, tissue specimens were taken. In November 2004, Menno de Jongand colleagues, at the Paediatric Hospital Number One, the Hospital for Tropical Disease and the OxfordUniversity Clinical Research Unit in Ho Chi Minh City, isolated avianinfluenza virus strain H5N1 from all of these specimens. Given the similarityof symptoms, it is likely that his sisterwas also infected. In humans, nervous system infection is an extremely rare complication of flu,but it is common in birds. Worryingly,H5N1 virus may be progressivelyadapting to mammals - and becomingmore neurologically virulent. In addition,the presence of virus in faeceshighlights a potential route of human-to-human transmission. If the symptoms of H5N1 are more diverse than previously thought, clinicalsurveillance might need to focus notonly on respiratory illnesses, but alsoon clusters of unexplained deaths orsevere illnesses. de Jong MD et al.

Funded by the Wellcome Trust and led by Professor Nick White -Director of the Wellcome TrustSouth-east Asia Major OverseasProgramme - the trial comparedtreatments for severe malaria in 1500 adult patients in centresacross Bangladesh, India,Indonesia and Myanmar. The trial compared the effectiveness of two plant-derived drugs: quinine(currently the accepted treatment forsevere malaria in most affected regions)against artesunate - a drug derivedfrom the sweet wormwood plant. It isthe first trial to show that the mortalityof severe malaria can be reduced bychanging from quinine to another drug:the results showed that artesunatereduced the death rate by 35 per cent. FLU ON THE BRAIN Symptoms of avian flu could be more diverse than previously suspected.

A new study, the largestof its type ever undertaken inAfrica, highlights the need forprevention and for overcomingthe political and financial barriersto widespread use of existingvaccines for bacterial diseases. With little epidemiological data available on bacterial infections among childrenin sub-Saharan Africa, James Berkley,Anthony Scott and colleagues studiedevery acute paediatric admission to KilifiDistrict Hospital in Kenya. The teamdocumented nearly 20 000 admissions,to assess the prevalence of bacterialinfections and to identify the mostcommon infectious organisms. Of all childhood deaths, 22 per cent were associated with malaria, but 26 per cent were of children admitted with invasive bacterial infections. Thissuggests that bacterial disease may be causing more deaths in childrenthan malaria, even in an area wheremalaria is endemic. Extrapolation of these findings across sub-Saharan Africa would imply thatdisease due to just two bacterialspecies, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae , would account for nearly half a million deathsin children under five every year. Mostof these deaths could be preventedwith the use of existing vaccines. The study suggests that bacterial diseases are more important to public health than has been thought -a misperception that could explain the failure to prioritise the introductionof vaccines. Berkley JA et al. Bacteremia among children admitted to a rural hospital in Kenya. N Engl JMed 2005;352(1):39-47. Bacterial infections are a major - and avoidable - cause of death in African children. Artesunate is already widely used as part of a combination therapy, to treatpeople with uncomplicated malaria.These results indicate that it is alsoeffective against severe malaria. As well as saving lives, artesunate is easier and safer to use than quinine -and cheaper. Although the results foradults are clear, more information isneeded on its possible benefits forchildren. Another multicentre clinicaltrial, also funded by the Wellcome Trust,is underway to test whether it is equallyeffective in children in Africa - wheresevere malaria has its biggest impact.

Lancet 2005;366(9487):717-25.A relatively new technique, otoacoustic emission, can be used to test hearing in all babiesat birth (universal newbornscreening). A controlled trial of thisapproach, undertaken by Dr ColinKennedy and colleagues at theUniversity of Southampton in the1990s, provided evidence of itsbenefits, and an eight-year follow-up has confirmed that it ensuresbabies and families receivesupport as rapidly as possible. Hearing difficulties in children are rare but can have a significant impact ontheir social and intellectual development.There are advantages to early diagnosis,so parents and health specialists canbegin helping a child as soon aspossible. Babies used to have theirhearing tested early in life, but this ledto a delay before infants were referred to specialists. Following the successful trials of universal newborn screening, it is beingintroduced across the UK. Dr Kennedyand colleagues have now carried outan eight-year follow-up on the babiesenrolled in the original trial. They foundthat the proportion of all babies withpermanent childhood hearingimpairment referred before the age of six months increased from 11 of 35(31 per cent) without universalscreening to 23 of 31 (74 per cent). The study re-emphasises the value of universal screening in rapidly identifyinghearing impairments, so early help canbe given to the baby and parents. Kennedy C et al. Universal newborn screening for permanent childhood hearing impairment: an8-year follow-up of a controlled trial.

Dr Masud Husain andcolleagues have discovered thatthis 'hemispatial neglect' can be improved by treatment with guanfacine. Guanfacine has previously been used to treat high blood pressure. It alsoacts on the brain, boosting the activityof neurons that use noradrenaline as a neurotransmitter.

Colonies of Staphylococcus aureus.L-R Infections with methicillin- resistant S. aureus (MRSA) occur most often in hospitals, but some,with increasing frequency, arefound in public places. Thesecommunity-acquired MRSAstrains differ from hospital strains,Dr Mark Enright (University ofBath and now Imperial CollegeLondon) and colleagues havefound, and some are descendedfrom a penicillin-resistant strainthat appeared in the 1950s andwas supposedly vanquished by methicillin in the 1960s. Rather than affecting elderly hospitalised patients, community-acquired MRSA seems to causedisease in children and young adults.The strains involved are resistant tofewer antibiotics than hospital MRSA,but produce a dangerous toxin thatcan cause large boils, septic shock or, in rare cases, a devastatingpneumonia that kills more than 40 per cent of those affected. By comparing the 'DNA fingerprints' of various MRSA strains (using atechnique called multilocus MLST), Dr Enright found that community-acquired strains arenot 'feral' hospital strains, and have a different evolutionary history. Someof the community strains aredescended from the 'type 80/81'strain, notable for being unusuallytransmissible and virulent, andprobably the most frequent cause of severe staphylococcal disease inthe mid-to-late 1950s. At the time, the strain was sensitive to methicillin,and so was suppressed when thisantibiotic was deployed in the 1960s.Now, however, the strain is re-emerging in the community, havinggained resistance to methicillin. Although only about 100 cases of community-acquired MRSA infectionhave been identified in the UK in thelast three years, such cases are morecommon in the USA, mainland Europeand Australia, and the researcherspoint out that these strains could pose a serious public health challengein coming years.

Director of the Wellcome Unit for the History of Medicine at the University of Oxford, Dr Harrison was awardedthe 2004 Templer Medal Book Prize for Medicine and Victory . The award is made each year by the Society forArmy Historical Research to the bookthat makes the most significantcontribution to advancing knowledgeand understanding of the history of the British Army. Published by Oxford University Press, Medicine and Victory is the first comprehensive account of Britishmilitary medicine in World War II sincethe official history published in the early1950s. It examines medical work in allthe main theatres of the war, from thefront line to the base hospital, andcovers all aspects of medical work,including the prevention of disease and the treatment of casualties. Since it assumes no previous knowledge of either medical or militaryhistory, Medicine and Victory provides an accessible introduction to this oftenneglected aspect of warfare.

GLOBAL ETHICS The Sixth Global Forum on Bioethics in Research, organisedby the Wellcome Trust and held in Malawi in March 2005, sawconstructive debate on theobligations of researchers andsponsors working in developingcountries. The Global Forum on Bioethics in Research is an informal partnershipestablished by a number oforganisations with a shared interest inthe ethics of research involving peoplein developing countries. Representatives from some 40 countries attended the meeting, from as far afield as South America,Australasia, Mongolia and China, aswell as Africa and Europe. Delegatesrepresented almost every disciplineand group with an interest in this area:biomedical researchers, clinicians,ethicists, lawyers, communityrepresentatives and others. Under discussion was the responsibility different groups mighthave after a research project hasended. Usually, study populations in underdeveloped countries will have gained benefits during a trial - such as access to medicines or betterhealthcare. Afterwards, should thebody funding the research continue to provide these benefits? If so, for howlong? Indefinitely? While some issues were easy to agree on, for others consensus was hard tofind. Nevertheless, informed debateinvolving such a range of parties, from such different cultures andbackgrounds, was fruitful in identifyingkey issues and moving the field along. The meeting also coincided with the launch of the Wellcome Trust's positionstatement on international researchethics and the publication of a reportfrom the Nuffield Council on Bioethics(which is part-funded by the WellcomeTrust) on good ethical practice in thedeveloping world.

USING KNOWLEDGE Supporting the development and use of knowledge to create health benefit.It is often vital to measure an individual's respiration rate but theequipment involved, such as facemasks or an electrocardiogram, iscumbersome and expensive. Now,thanks to new software, accuratemeasurements can be obtainedfrom a monitoring device alreadywidely used in hospitals. Professor Paul Addison and colleagues at Napier University inEdinburgh hit upon their innovationwhile analysing the signals from apulse oximeter - a medical deviceused to measure oxygen saturationand heart rate. A light probe is clippedto the person's finger, and transmittedlight is detected and analysed. Using a relatively new technique, wavelet transform, to analyse thepulse oximeter signal (called thephotoplethysmogram or pleth), the researchers realised that some of the regular patterns in the signal werecaused by the person's breathing. By refining their software, they wereable to measure both respiratory rateand respiratory effort automatically,continuously and non-invasively. Recent clinical trials on premature babies have confirmed the effectivenessof the technique. The next step is todesign a pulse oximeter in which thisextra measuring facility is already anintegral part. This technology was developed by researchers at CardioDigital Ltd - acompany set up in 2001 by ProfessorAddison, Dr Brendan McGuckin andDr Jamie Watson. In the longer term,they aim to develop other tools toextract extra useful information frommedical signals. www.cardiodigital.comA pioneering polymer and mineral implant, which readily bonds withbone without causing adversereactions, has helped surgeons to rebuild the faces of childreninjured in accidents or born with serious disfigurements.Developed by UK and Russianscientists, 'PolyHap' implantshave been used on around 50children, including a baby with ajaw tumour and a 12-year-old girlwho had been barely able to openher mouth from birth. The PolyHap implants combine a polymer commonly used in dentistryand a mineral-like substance calledhydroxyapatite, which can integrateinto bone structures and support bone growth without breaking down or dissolving. The collaboratingscientists also found a way to increaseporosity - important for new bonegrowth - and to clean out toxins from the polymer implants using high-pressure carbon dioxide. BREATHTAKING A person's breathing rate can be measured from his or her fingertip. USING KNOWLEDGE 18 NEW FACES A revolutionary new implant is helping surgeons to rebuilddamaged faces. Patterns in data collected by pulse oximeters canshed light on otherphysiological activity. PolyHap implants have been successfullyused to rebuildchildren's faces.A cross-section through a new tooth grown in a mouse, showingdifferentiation of dentine(D), pulp (P) and theroot (R). L-RUSING KNOWLEDGE 19 THE BIOTOOTH After the age of 50, people in Western countries lose an averageof 12 teeth. At present the optionsare to replace them with denturesor an artificial implant. Researchersare investigating the possibility ofreplacing a lost or damaged toothwith a living, natural tooth createdfrom the patient's own tissue, andgrown in its intended location inthe patient's mouth. To achieve this, in 2002, Professor Paul Sharpe at the Dental Institute,King's College London, founded a regenerative dentistry company,Odontis Ltd, with a Wellcome Trusttechnology transfer grant. Thecompany is dedicated to growinghuman teeth by studying the complexformative processes that produceteeth in a developing embryo - andcombining this understanding withadvances in stem cell biology andtissue engineering. Experiments in mice have shown that if the two different types of cell thatproduce a tooth bud in an embryo -epithelial and mesenchymal cells - arecombined in culture, then implanted in an adult mouth, new teeth start toform. Moreover, the teeth form in thecorrect orientation, are the right sizeand shape for their location (molarsare shaped like molars, incisors likeincisors and so on), and even attach themselves to the jawbone by softconnective tissue. If left long enough,the teeth form roots and erupt. Having demonstrated the feasibility of this technology in the mouse, theresearchers now aim to move thescience established in the mouse intocommercial product development -and test the 'BioTooth' in humans. Crucial to the success of the BioTooth is the need to identify an effective and easily accessible source of theindividual's own cells to use as rawmaterial. This avoids rejection by theimmune system, and because toothsize, shape and colour are geneticallydetermined, it also means theengineered teeth will more closelymatch the person's natural teeth. Having tested the potential of various cell types, the researchers found thatadult stem cells derived from bonemarrow can replace embryonicmesenchyme in the tooth formationprocess. Other research suggests that progenitor stem cells capable ofgenerating a variety of tooth tissues,including enamel, could be presentwithin teeth themselves. Modina S, Sharpe PT. Tissue engineering of teeth using adult stem cells. Arch Oral Biol2005;50(2):255-8.Advances in tissue engineering could enable people who lose a tooth to grow a replacement, made of their own cells, in their own mouths. The implants were developed by teams led by Dr Vladimir Popov fromthe Institute of Laser and InformationTechnology in Troitsk, near Moscow,and Professor Steve Howdle ofNottingham University. When a child is assessed for an operation at the St Vladimir Children'sHospital, Moscow, scientists useadvanced imaging and laser-basedtechniques (laser stereolithography) to create a three-dimensional plasticcast of the damaged area. Havingassessed, with the surgeon, how much bone needs to be removed, the scientists then mould the individual PolyHap implants. Current Wellcome Trust-funded research is targeted at the use of anew laser-based process (sintering) to create implants from biodegradablepolymers and incorporating verydelicate growth hormones to improvethe performance of the implants.

J Mater Sci Mater Med2004;15(2):123-8.A team from the London School of Economics and PoliticalScience, led by Dr Mary Moran,has documented dramatic changein research into ten 'neglecteddiseases', including malaria,tuberculosis, leprosy and sleepingsickness. These changes couldresult in at least eight new drugsbeing developed by 2010. After a barren period when very few therapies were introduced for thesediseases, which kill around three millionpeople a year and cause the loss ofthe equivalent of 92 million years ofhealthy life, there are now more than60 drug research projects underway.Around three-quarters of these projectsare conducted under the umbrella ofpublic-private partnerships (PPPs) fordrug development.The Moran report identifies PPPs as a critical driver of this increase in activity,and suggests that they deserve theactive support of policy makers and politicians. Dr Moran's teamrecommends the creation of a publicfund to pay for research anddevelopment of drugs for neglecteddiseases within PPPs, which theyestimate would cost up to \u00a31.1 billion(US$1.9 billion) over ten years. The report also argues that a package of incentives should be established to encourage research by small ormedium-sized companies, which areincreasingly important players in theneglected disease field.

The system is sensitive,simple and does not require thespecialised equipment currentlyneeded to test blood samples for HIV and hepatitis. Dr Helen Lee and colleagues have previously developed a cheap andeasy-to-use diagnostic dipstick test forchlamydia, an important and difficult-to-diagnose sexually transmitted infection.Now, the group has adapted thetechnology to detect viruses andmultiple infections. Current testing for HIV and hepatitis involves fluorescent probes designedTACKLING NEGLECT Innovative new approaches are fundamentally changing the way neglected diseases are tackled, a new report suggests.USING KNOWLEDGE 20 VIRAL DETECTION A new visual dipstick test can detect HIV, hepatitis B andhepatitis C simultaneously. Drug development for neglected diseaseshas been boostedsignificantly by public-private partnerships. Hepatitis B virus particles.Professor Bob Snow, with Dr Sam Ochola,Head of the Division ofMalaria Control in Kenya. The malaria parasite within red blood cells.L-R USING KNOWLEDGE 21 MAPPING MALARIA Professor Bob Snow and his team, at the University of Oxfordand the Kenya Medical ResearchInstitute-Wellcome TrustLaboratories in Nairobi, have used a variety of methods tocalculate the likely number ofcases of malaria in a single year,2002. Their estimate of 515 millionclinical episodes of P. falciparum suggests that tackling malaria willrequire even greater attention thangovernments and health agenciesmight have anticipated. The latest estimates used contemporary and historicalepidemiological, geographical anddemographic information to modelwhere people live, the likelihood that they become infected, and their susceptibility to developing the disease. The models also madeuse of new methods in geographic information systems and data fromEarth-orbiting satellites. According to the new analysis, more than two-thirds of cases occurred inAfrica, where P . falciparum malaria mostly affects children under five. But far more cases than previouslythought take place outside Africa, with nearly 25 per cent of worldwidecases occurring in South-east Asia and the Western Pacific. Although the numbers remain estimates, they provide a moreaccurate picture of the likely globalburden of malaria - important if thedisease is to receive the public healthpriority it deserves. Snow RW et al. The global distribution of clinical episodes of Plasmodium falciparum malaria.Nature 2005;434(7030):214-7. More than half a billion cases of deadly Plasmodium falciparum malaria occurred in 2002 - suggesting that malaria is an even bigger problemthan previously thought. to bind to viral nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). Not only is this procedureexpensive and time-consuming, it also requires special instruments. Dr Lee's team developed a new dipstick for HIV-1, hepatitis B andhepatitis C, all major global publichealth problems. The dipstick wastested on clinical samples, afteramplification of viral nucleic acid. It detected many different strains ofthe viruses, and produced sensitive,reproducible and specific results. As it does away with the need forcomplex instrumentation, the dipstickcould potentially be of great benefit,particularly in resource-poor settings. Dineva MA et al.

ENGAGING SOCIETY Engaging with society to foster an informed climate within which biomedical research can flourish.The Big Picture series was launched in January 2005,successor to LabNotes . The publication provides teachersand post-16 students with up-to-date information on keyareas of biomedical research,while exploring their social andethical implications. The nanoscience issue focused on the science and application ofnanotechnologies, engineering atscales smaller than 100 nanometres(for comparison, a human hair is 80 000 nm wide). Many excitingopportunities exist, but the strangeproperties of material at such scalestake us into areas of unknown risk. The obesity issue looked at physiological, psychological and socialinfluences on weight control, as well as the personal and social consequencesof rising levels of obesity. It alsoencouraged readers to consider whoshould take responsibility for tacklingthis mounting problem. Issues and supplementary materials are freely available on the WellcomeTrust website. The obesity issue alsofeatures an interactive online game for students, who have to raise an'Ob', an alien life form with a tendencyto become obese. The nanoscienceissue also included an online activity -a version of a 'Democs' game, whichenables classes to debate theregulation of an emerging area suchas nanotechnology. www.wellcome.ac.uk/bigpictureIf UK science is to flourish, it needs trained and motivatedscience teachers armed with up-to-date knowledge and skills.The new National Science Learning Centre funded by theWellcome Trust, and a key reportcommissioned by the Trust,represent important contributionsto achieving this essential aim. Science teachers face considerable challenges. They have to train the nextgeneration of scientists and engineers,but also equip non-specialists with theknowledge and skills they need to thrivein a technologically advanced society.They need to keep abreast of thepotential offered by new technologies.And, above all, they need to stay up tospeed with a rapidly changing subject. Little wonder that teachers' professional development has become a key issue.It received a major boost with thedecision of the Wellcome Trust and the Department for Education and Skills in 2002 to co-fund a \u00a351 millioninitiative to develop a national networkof Science Learning Centres, intendedto provide high-quality continuing LITTLE AND LARGE Contrasting topics - nanoscience and obesity - were covered in the first issues in the Big Picture series for teachers and post-16 students.

Itsimaginative juxtaposition ofmedical objects and imagery,artworks old and new, andscientific discovery provided manynovel insights into the everyday yetstill mysterious phenomenon offaces and face recognition. Running from October 2004 to February 2005, Future Face was the final exhibition in a series mounted by the Wellcome Trust at the ScienceMuseum. It explored severalfundamental questions about thehuman face. What makes a face? Why are faces so important to oursense of identity? And how do peoplereact to damaged and different faces? The exhibition also explored the modification and reconstruction of theface for medical or cosmetic reasons,and considered what faces might looklike in the future. Curated by Sandra Kemp, Director of Research at the Royal College of Art,the exhibition was named one of theTimes Higher Education Supplement 's Research Projects of the Year. It wasaccompanied by a book and CD-ROM, and was complemented bydebates and discussions, a 'Face onFilm' held in November 2004at the Curzon Mayfair, and otherspecial events in venues throughoutLondon (including the ScienceMuseum's Dana Centre). A 'Facing Death' symposium, held at the National Portrait Gallery inJanuary 2005, brought togetherdynamic voices from the worlds of arthistory, media, medicine and scienceto discuss the past, present and future of the facial representations of death.

In 2004/05, the building housing the National Science Learning Centre was completed. Based in York andmanaged by the White RoseConsortium, comprising the Universitiesof Leeds, Sheffield, York and SheffieldHallam, the Centre is set to provide anunrivalled facility for teachers from bothprimary and secondary schools. What of its intended clientele? In 2005, the Wellcome Trust commissioned amajor survey of primary and secondaryschool teachers in England's stateschools, to establish their experienceof CPD, what they wanted from CPD, and what obstacles preventedgreater participation. While most respondents were strongly supportive of CPD in principle - andparticularly wanted more subject-specific courses - they were notsatisfied with current opportunities.Science teachers were least confident in their current expertise and most keen to enhance their skills. The CPD report can be found at www.wellcome.ac.uk/believers. The Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons, which reopened in February 2005, provides visitors with achance to see the equipmentused for the first 'keyhole' gallbladder removal in England,preserved crocodile embryos,and a prototype 'bionic' heart, among more than 3500fascinating exhibits. At the heart of the Hunterian Museum is an astonishing 18th-century medicalcollection - the legacy of the ground-breaking anatomist and surgeon JohnHunter FRS (1728-1793). He built upan extensive museum, which he used for teaching and for research on topicsas diverse as the transplantation ofteeth and the breeding of bees. Afterhis death, the collection was given tothe Royal College of Surgeons. The museum is open to the public, free of charge, Tuesday to Saturday -or virtual tours can be undertaken onthe Royal College of Surgeons website. The refurbishment of the Hunterian Museum was funded by the WellcomeTrust, the Heritage Lottery Fund, theRoyal College of Surgeons, theHunterian Trustees and others. www.rcseng.ac.uk/museums/A Pop Idol -style debating competition for sixth-form andfurther education college students,provocative online debatesorganised by Spiked Online, and a series of public debates at theInstitute of Contemporary Arts(ICA) in London all helped a varietyof public groups to consider thefuture of biomedical science.

L-R ENGAGING SOCIETY 27 HANDS ON SCIENCE Research developments in body clocks, genes affecting languageand keyhole surgery have beenamong the exciting scientificareas featured in EngagingScience People Awards. Withthese small but flexible awards,researchers have been able toengage members of the publicdirectly with science. From September to November 2004, Dr Simon Archer and colleagues at the University of Surrey gave visitors to the Science Museum a chance toparticipate directly in a research project.The Surrey team has been exploringthe genetic links to body clocks -circadian rhythms - particularly whetherpeople are at their best in the morning('larks') or at night ('owls'). Visitorscompleted questionnaires on their dailyhabits and provided mouth swabs forDNA analysis. Participation was also central to a project run at the Institute ofContemporary Arts (ICA) by Dr JulieWebb, Vivienne Gaskin and Professor Amanda Fisher of Imperial College. A working DNA sequence lab wasinstalled at the ICA, enabling visitorsto see researchers in action, talk toscientists and help in the analysis of results. School students are a crucial audience for public engagement. A projectorganised by Professor O JamesGarden, Stephen Wigmore andAndrew de Beaux at the University ofEdinburgh has given children a chanceto try their hand at surgical proceduressuch as keyhole surgery and suturing.There is a competitive element to theproject, with students being assessedfor speed and accuracy. People Awards provide sums of up to \u00a330 000 for innovative public engagement projects. They are designed to be a fast and flexible way of providing support to scientists,science communicators or othermediators keen to work withpublic groups.Members of the public have gained first-hand experience of biomedical research, thanks to People Awards. With Wellcome Trust support, online publisher Spiked ran a series of web-based debates and public events ontopics such as global outbreaks ofinfectious disease, drugs and health,and complementary medicine. Theseexperiments highlighted thepossibilities offered by the web toengage large numbers of people inconstructive debate. The ICA public debates included 'Open Access Science' (January2005), 'Science and Democracy'(March 2005), which explored how the public can feed into scientific policymaking, and 'The Trouble with Boys'(September 2005), examining what canbe done about the current educationaland emotional underdevelopment ofboys.

It processes and trims precursorRNAs, making them ready for use by the cell. At the Universityof Edinburgh, Professor DavidTollervey, a Wellcome TrustPrincipal Research Fellow, andcolleagues have now identified acomplex of proteins that speedsup the exosome's work. Eukaryotic cells produce a huge amount of RNA, but this is seldomused 'as is'. In most cases, longprecursor RNAs need to be trimmedand cut up into mature forms that can be used as templates for proteinsynthesis or as components of theprotein factories themselves, theribosomes. In 1997, Professor Tollervey and colleagues identified the complex of ten exonuclease proteins - theexosome - that plays a key role in thisprocessing, as well as in degradingdefective RNAs that fail quality controlchecks. Two forms of the exosomewere found: a cytoplasmic form that is involved in the turnover ofmessenger RNA (mRNA), and theversion in the nuclear and own, in a test-tube, the exosome works rather slowly, so it was thought that its activity in cells might be boosted by additionalfactors. Professor Tollervey's team has now found such an acceleratingfactor: the TRAMP complex (short forthe Trf4p/Air2p/Mtr4p which promotes in the nucleus by theexosome. This system shows notablesimilarities to RNA degradation inbacteria, suggesting that it is ofancient evolutionary origin. LaCava J et al. RNA degradation by the exosome is promoted by a nuclearpolyadenylation complex. Cell2005;121(5):713-24.A protein complex that accelerates an important nuclear RNA- processing machine has been identified. The hippocampus is vital for memory, but researchersdisagree on its exact role. Now, Dr Dharshan Kumaran and SeniorResearch Fellow Dr EleanorMaguire have shown that it isactive when people visualisenavigating to different locationsbut not when they imaginenetworks of friends. Dr Maguire has previously shown that taxi drivers have notably largehippocampi, presumably because of their need to carry about 'theknowledge' of London landmarks. But does the hippocampus store a'virtual map' of the physical world or is it recalling relationships between objectsin a more generic way? To compare these theories, Dr Kumaran and Dr Maguire used functionalmagnetic resonance imaging to revealwhich parts of participants' brains wereactive as they visualised the routebetween their friends' houses and thenthe social connections between thefriends themselves. The tasks activated separate brain networks, with the hippocampusinvolved only in spatial, not social,processing. Kumaran D, Maguire EA. The human hippocampus: cognitive maps or relationalmemory?

Dr Eleanor Maguire, Institute of Neurology,University CollegeLondon.L-RLEFT-RIGHT HEART By controlling protein degradation, the anaphase-promotingcomplex/cyclosome (APC/C) iscrucial to the normal functioning of the cell cycle in many differentorganisms. Dr Andrea Brand andcolleagues at the Gurdon Instituteof Cancer and DevelopmentalBiology in Cambridge haveshown, unexpectedly, that theAPC/C also plays an importantrole at synapses, the junctionsbetween neurons, and hence innervous system function. The activity of neurons is very finely controlled. An important aspect of thiscontrol, it has recently become clear,comes from tight regulation of proteinlevels within cells. One way this can be achieved is through the ubiquitinsystem, which tags proteins fordegradation within the cell.Not much is known about this process in neurons, but it has been studied formany years in dividing cells. A keycomponent is the APC/C complex of proteins. Dr Brand and colleagueslooked to see if this complex might also be active in neurons at theneuromuscular synapses, where nervemeets muscle, in the fruit fly Drosophila . They found that the APC/C has two highly significant effects - on thesize of synapses and the transmissionof signals across them. The APC/Cacts on muscle cells, regulating thenumber of receptors for glutamate, aneurotransmitter released by neuronsinnervating the muscle. The discovery of APC/C activity at the synapse opens up a new area of studyof this key aspect of animal biology. van Roessel P et al.

Manipulating four-cell Labelling of individual cells in a four-cell mouse embryo.L-RAbout one child in 125 is born with a congenital heart defect - a problem with the developmentof the heart itself or of the majorblood vessels that connect to the heart. Professor ShoumoBhattacharya's studies of themouse gene Cited2 suggest that many such defects may be due to problems with the developmentof the heart's asymmetry. During embryonic development, the heart begins as a single tube that then'loops' and contorts, eventually formingthe four chambers of the adult heart.This is necessary for two parallelcirculations to develop: the right side of the heart delivering blood to thelungs, the left side delivering blood tothe body. Common congenital heartdefects arise when this developmentgoes awry, leading to, among otherthings, holes in the heart, closed valves,or misalignment of the great vessels. Genes that control the asymmetry of the heart may underlie commoncongenital heart defects. EARLY DEVELOPERS Somehow, a single cell - the fertilised egg - has to generate an entire adult body, with all itsbody parts in the right place. Inmany organisms, the asymmetricdistribution of key factors in theegg establishes polarities such as the front-to-back axis. Inmammals, though, this process is more flexible and poorlyunderstood. Dr MagdalenaZernicka-Goetz and colleagueshave now shown that despite thisflexibility, early patterns of celldivision in mice can influence the course of development. Dr Zernicka-Goetz, a Senior Research Fellow at the Gurdon Institute ofCancer and Developmental Biology in Cambridge, carefully manipulatedone-cell mouse embryos before theydivided. Her aim was to alter the planeof cell division, or how the contents of the cell are partitioned betweendaughter cells, and to use cell labellingtechniques to see what happened to the progeny of each cell. Using such techniques she was able to show that, in most embryos,the first cell cleavage predicts the 'embryonic-abembryonic' axis - one daughter cell tends to give rise to tissues of the animal, plus somesurrounding tissues, while the othertends to generate cells that will formsupporting tissues and others that will signal how the body shoulddevelop. But whether or not thishappens depends on the pattern of cleavage divisions. Dr Zernicka-Goetz also discovered that it was possible to predict the future development of cells in four-cellembryos that had divided following acertain pattern. Moreover, the progenyof each of the four cells had differentdevelopmental properties -contradicting received wisdom that allfour cells are equivalent at this stage.Remarkably, however, all cells inembryos retain developmental flexibilityand so these properties are not fixeduntil later.

Highly inbred (genetically verysimilar) mice lacking Cited2 had severe heart defects - the left side of theheart developed as a right side, acondition called right isomerism thatalso occurs, rarely, in humans. Non-pedigree mice lacking Cited2 had a range of less severe heart defects,such as holes in the heart andmisalignment of the great vessels. As the defects seen in the latter mice are similar to the diverse range ofcongenital heart defects seen inhumans - who are also 'non-pedigree'- the research suggests problems withthe heart's left-right patterning may beat fault in both cases.

FACILITATING RESEARCH Promoting the best conditions for research and the use of knowledge.FACILITATING RESEARCH 33 BENCH TO BEDSIDE PROTEIN POWER Proteins are responsible for most cellular functions that underlie life,and are the targets of most drugs.They are therefore crucial to ourhealth. To advance basic andapplied research on proteins, theStructural Genomics Consortium(SGC), a not-for-profit company, isdetermining the three-dimensionalstructures of proteins of medicalrelevance, and placing them in thepublic domain without restriction. The SGC applies a high-throughput approach to structure determination,concentrating on human proteins likelyto be of medical importance andproteins from pathogenic organisms,such as the malarial parasite. The structures are freely released, creating a valuable resource foracademic research and drug discovery.During 2004/05, the SGC has beenhighly successful, achieving its first-year milestone of 50 human andmalaria protein structures on budgetand two months ahead of schedule.By year-end it had completed well over 100 structures. The SGC has been funded by the Wellcome Trust, GlaxoSmithKline and a group of Canadian funding agencies.Earlier this year Swedish funders joinedthe SGC and a Swedish node waslaunched at the Karolinska Institute. www.thesgc.comBased at Birmingham, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Manchester andSouthampton, Wellcome TrustClinical Research Facilities (CRFs)were set up to provide much-needed space in a hospital settingfor research involving people.Studies carried out in the facilitiesare helping to clarify mechanismsof disease, and providing resultsof direct clinical relevance. In Edinburgh, for example, the CRF has hosted numerous studies on a large cohort of elderly Scottishpeople, who underwent a series of mental examinations in the 1930s.These studies are providing a wealthof information on early and mid-lifefactors linked to cognitive decline in the elderly. 1,2Of more immediate clinical relevance was a trial of statintherapy for calcific aortic stenosis, thebuild-up of deposits on heart valves. 3 One of the Birmingham CRF'sspecialisms is gene therapy. It has, for example, tested an approach tocancer gene therapy in which cancercells are engineered to make a pro-drug-metabolising enzyme. 4Cambridge has hosted a number ofimportant studies on body metabolismand obesity, including work thatidentified an unsuspected role for the TrkB protein in human obesity. 5 Southampton's Clinical ResearchFacility has hosted research in a widerange of areas, from the genetic basisof resistance to hepatitis C virus 6and susceptibility to osteoarthritis,7to the effect of food additives on hyperactivityin children. 8 Research carried out in Manchesterhas identified genetic variations thatpredispose to early-onset arthritis andpsoriasis. 9,10The facility was also used for studies of brain function in peoplewith antisocial personality disorder(psychopathy) and borderlinepersonality disorder. 11 1 Gow AJ et al.

The website provides full, unedited recordings, short audio samples,written summaries, full transcripts, and ways of locating sections of theinterviews that cover particular topics. Most participants agreed to talk about their experiences because they feltthey had benefited from past research and so were glad to contribute tofuture research. Their audio recordingsprovide a resource for historians,healthcare professionals, people with diabetes, and anyone interestedin exploring the human aspect of livingwith diabetes. Together, they provide a unique historical overview oftreatments and medical developmentsduring the 20th century. An Oral History of Diabetes is based at the Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology andMetabolism; it is funded by the Wellcome Trustand run by Professor David Matthews, Universityof Oxford. www.diabetes-stories.com The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute played a major role inthe sequencing of the genomesof Trypanosoma brucei of genome sequencespublished in 2005. Known as 'neglected diseases' because relatively little effort has beenapplied to finding cures, diseasescaused by T. brucei , its South American relative T. cruzi and Leishmania together kill more than 150 000 people everyyear, and debilitate millions more. One of the most surprising findings revealed by the genome sequencingwas the extent of antigenic diversitycoded within the T. brucei genome. To evade host immune responses, the parasite periodically switches itssurface protein coat. Its genome hasturned out to contain far more coatprotein genes than was previouslythought, enhancing its ability to escapethe attention of the immune system. The T. brucei and Leishmania genomes were sequenced at the Wellcome TrustSanger Institute, in partnership with theKarolinska Institute, Stockholm, theSeattle Biomedical Research Institute,and The Institute for Genome Researchin the USA.TALKING ABOUT DIABETES A new website captures the life stories of people with diabetes, in freely available audio recordings. FACILITATING RESEARCH 34 TRITRYP GENOMES Photographs from the Oral History of Diabeteswebsite. Dr Al Ivens, one of the team at the SangerInstitute that sequencedthe 'tritryp' genomes.Single-celled trypanosome from theALSPAC cohort.L-R The genomes of parasites causing three major diseases in developingcountries have been sequenced. FACILITATING RESEARCH 35 CHILDREN'S GIFTS The ALSPAC study team has followed around 14 000 childrenand their parents from beforebirth. The children are nowaround 13-14 years old.Throughout this time, detailedinformation has been gatheredabout their health and lifestyle.The cohort's size, and the rangeof information gathered, meansthat many health-relatedassociations can be explored. Exposure to mercury is known to affect childhood cognitivedevelopment and early motor skills.There have been fears that thimerosal- a mercury-containing preservativeused in some children's vaccines -might harm young children. Use ofALSPAC data, however, revealed nolink between exposure to thimerosaland poor cognitive performance. 1 In another ALSPAC analysis,depression in fathers was associatedwith adverse emotional andbehavioural outcomes in childrenaged 3.5 years, and an increased risk of conduct problems in boys.Paternal depression thus seems to have a specific and lasting effecton children's early development. 2 Up to a third of people carry Neisseria meningitidis , but rates of invasive meningococcal disease are fairly low -possibly because of naturally acquiredprotective immunity. In ALSPAC children, salivary IgA levels against a range of meningococcal antigensincreased with age, suggesting thatIgA is important in host defenceagainst meningococci. 3 Bone mass in later life is related to birth weight, suggesting that theenvironment in the womb influenceslater bone development. In ALSPACfamilies, several aspects of maternaldiet in pregnancy were linked tochildren's bone mass and othermeasures at age nine, suggesting that maternal diet is programmingbone development in childhood(although the effect sizes are small). 4 Paracetamol use in late pregnancy hasbeen linked to an increased risk of earlywheezing in offspring. Further work onthe ALSPAC cohort confirmed that useof paracetamol, but not aspirin, in latepregnancy was associated withasthma. If the association is causal, as much as 7 per cent of childhoodasthma could be put down toparacetamol exposure. 5 1 Heron J et al. Pediatrics 2004;114(3):577-83. 2 Ramchandani P et al.

ALSPAC is jointly funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Council.Data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) continue to provide insight into many areas of medicine. In partnership with sequencing centres and the World Health Organization'sSpecial Programme for Research andTraining in Tropical Diseases (TDR), the Wellcome Trust produced a CD-ROM package including the threegenome sequences, genome-browsingsoftware, PDFs of the Science articles, background material, and introductorytutorials on parasite biology and theirdiseases. The CD-ROMs are availablefrom TDR free to researchers indeveloping countries. The Sanger Institute also published the sequence of Theileria annulata , a parasite of cattle that has adevastating impact on farming,particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.Clues to the organism's biologyrevealed by the genome sequence are suggesting new approaches to drug and vaccine development.

STRATEGIC PLAN The Wellcome Trust has published its second Strategic Plan, Making a Difference, covering the period2005-2010. Our Strategic Plan sets out our aims, objectives and priorities for the nextfive years. Its title, Making a Difference, reflects our desire to continue making asignificant impact in our areas ofoperation. Six strategic aims have been identified in the Plan - advancing knowledge,using knowledge, engaging society,developing people, facilitating researchand developing our organisation. Theseform the basis of the front section ofthis Annual Review. These strategic aims provide a flexible framework, guiding but notconstraining the work we support inorder to achieve our mission. INVESTMENTS Active management of our portfolio of investments has seenits value rise to \u00a312.3 billion. Our funding is made possible by the income derived from our asset base -a mixed portfolio of property, equitiesand other forms of investment. Theasset base is managed both to secureour long-term future and to generateincome to support ongoing fundingcommitments. The investment portfolio has benefited this year from an upturn in globalmarkets. Expenditure also increasedsignificantly this year (see page 38).Overall, we currently plan to spendsome \u00a32.25 billion over the next five years. More information about investments, and full details of expenditure, can be found in our Annual Report.ONLINE APPLICATION A new online grant application system, eGrants, was launched in 2005. Launched in February 2005, the eGrants system has proved a popularoption with grant applicants. It hasbeen developed in close partnershipwith institutional administrative officesand is integrated with their systems. The eGrants system will be in place for the next couple of years.Meanwhile, a project has begun tocreate a radically new system that will encompass grant application and management, refereeing, andcommittee review. This new system is currently scheduled for rollout in 2007.DEVELOPING OUR ORGANISATION Using our resources efficiently and effectively.OVERVIEW 37 WELLCOME TRUST 2004/05 A brief overview of corporate activities over the year. Clinical research This year the Wellcome Trust has beenan active contributor to the UK ClinicalResearch Collaboration (UKCRC), apartnership of the key agencies involvedin clinical research and practice in theUK. By working together to set a futureagenda for clinical research, the UKCRCis helping to ensure that the UK canmaintain and enhance its position as a world leader in this area, building onsuch strengths as the NHS andbiomedical research expertise. Progress this year included publication of the report Medically and Dentally Qualified Academic Staff:Recommendations for training theresearchers and educators of the future,produced by the Academic AffairsSubcommittee of the UKCRC and theDepartment of Health's ModernisingMedical Careers initiative, chaired byMark Walport. The Trust also launched a major clinical research infrastructureinitiative under the UKCRC umbrella. Open access The Trust has continued to press forenhanced access to scientific research,through open access to the scientificliterature. For grants awarded after 1 October 2005, research papers partlyor wholly funded by the Wellcome Trustmust be made freely accessible viaPubMed Central as soon as possible,and no later than six months afterpublication. From 1 October 2006, outputs from grants awarded before 1 October 2005 must also be madeavailable. To facilitate this, a specialsubmission system for Trust papers has been set up on PubMed Central. Strategy Committees The Wellcome Trust's new 'streams'structure was formally introduced on 1 October 2004. During the year, the first meetings were held of new StrategyCommittees for each stream. These willconsider needs and opportunities withintheir areas, and provide strategic input to the Board of Governors. Strategic Awards A new funding scheme was launched in 2005 to provide a highly flexible route of support for internationallyrenowned groups seeking to developresearch programmes in innovativedirections. Strategic Awards will allow groups considerable freedom to develop and enhance their research and training programmes. Other important grants changes during the year included moves to open up grants eligibility, for example to researchers in institutions funded byResearch Councils or cancer charities. Policy developments A new policy statement on researchinvolving people in developing countrieswas released in 2005 (see page 15).The statement sets out the ethical framework that underlies the Trust'sfunding decisions in these areas, andprovides guiding principles and practicaladvice. The Trust also worked with theBiotechnology and Biological SciencesResearch Council and the MedicalResearch Council to develop a funders'policy statement on managing risks ofresearch misuse. Among its submissions to external consultations, the Trust provided inputinto a Department for Culture, Media and Sport consultation on humanremains, emphasising the value of such material in research and education.The Trust provided input into severalareas of legislation that could impact on biomedical research, including theMental Capacity Bill, the SeriousOrganised Crime and Police Bill, theCharities Bill, and the Human Tissue Act. Governors and senior staff This year, Chris Edwards completed histerm as a Governor. William Castell wasappointed Chairman-designate. He willjoin the Board of Governors in January2006 and will succeed Dominic Cadburyas Chairman in May 2006. In September2005, Danny Truell joined the Trust asChief Investment Officer. FUNDING 2004/05 1 October 2004 to 30 September 2005. In the year ending 30 September 2005, the Wellcome Trust's totalcharitable expenditure was \u00a3483m(see right), a considerable increasefrom last year's figure of \u00a3382m. As in previous years, the largest single element of Trust expenditure (more than\u00a3300m) was for investigator-ledproposals in biomedical science(summarised in the following pages). Major awards The Trust is providing \u00a314.6m supportfor three Grand Challenges in GlobalHealth projects. This new partnership,supported by the Gates Foundation(US$450m), the Wellcome Trust and theCanadian Institutes of Health Research(US$4.5m), is focusing on 14 majorscientific problems. The Trust-funded projects centre on HIV vaccine development (RobinShattock, St George's Hospital MedicalSchool, London), protective immunityagainst malaria (Professor DominicKwiatkowski, Oxford) and TB latency(Professor Douglas Young, ImperialCollege London). International health was also the focus of a \u00a310m award to the Medicines for Malaria Venture, a not-for-profitpublic-private partnership developingnew drugs for malaria. Wellcome Trust Genome Campus and Sanger Institute Total expenditure at the Wellcome TrustGenome Campus amounted to \u00a379.3m(2003/04: \u00a375.6m). Most of this went on support of research and developmentof facilities at the Wellcome Trust SangerInstitute (page 49). Medical humanities and public engagement Grants funding in the medicalhumanities (history of medicine and biomedical ethics) and publicengagement amounted to \u00a325.3m (2003/04: \u00a326.1m). This encompassesresponse-mode funding thenewly opened National Science LearningCentre (pages 24-25). Projects run directly by the Wellcome Trust (or in partnership with others)accounted for a further \u00a312.5m of expenditure in this area. Thisincludes support for the WellcomeLibrary and the Trust's own publicengagement activities.Investments The value of the Trust's investmentportfolio ended the year at \u00a312.3bn, up \u00a31.8bn from the start of the year. This represents an annual return (afterallowing for inflation) of 19.5 per cent.Returns have averaged 14.1 per centover the past three years and 7.7 percent over the past ten years. TheWellcome Trust's long-term financialposition therefore remains strong,despite the large drop in global marketsearlier this decade.FUNDING 2004/05 38 Breakdown of Wellcome Trust Total: \u00a3482.8m \u00a3305.6m Biomedical science \u00a312.9m Technology and History\u00a314.6m Biomedical science \u00a33.1m Technology Transfer\u00a312.5m Medicine, Society and History \u00a371.9m Genome Campus \u00a318.1m Biomedical \u00a32.2m Technology Transfer\u00a39.2m Medicine, Society and History\u00a37.4m Genome Campus* initiatives managed by the Wellcome Trust or with partners costs to support the running of each activity\u00a336.9m Support\u00a3102.1m Direct *\u00a3343.8m Grants New and renewed and senior: 04/05 03/04 04/05 03/04 Principal Research Fellowships New 1 1 0 0 Renewal 2 3 1 0 Senior Research Fellowships New 7 6 4 2 Renewal 5 7 3 1 International 7 12 - - Intermediate: Research Career Development 24 18 - - Fellowships (and other intermediate fellowships) Intermediate clinical fellowships -- 13 9 Training: Research training Four-year PhD Studentships 89 76 - - Research Training Fellowships - - 27 29\u00a325.7m Renewal of Major Overseas Programmes in South-east Asia and Kenya. page 41 \u00a314.6m Three Grand Challenges in Global Health projects. \u00a314m Diamond synchrotron project. \u00a313.1m Renewal of Wellcome Trust centres.

There were smallincreases in the numbers of most UKsenior and intermediate-levelfellowships awarded during the year(see below left). Following a relaunchof the Careers Re-entry Fellowshipscheme, which provides a route backinto science after a career break,three fellowships were awarded. Seven International Senior Research Fellowships (available in central andeastern Europe, India and South Africa)were also awarded in 2004/05. International support The main focus of the WellcomeTrust's international funding are itsMajor Overseas Programmes. Corefunding of the South-east Asia andKenya Programmes was renewed. The Africa Centre for Health andPopulation Studies in South Africareceived two years' additional coresupport, worth \u00a33.1m. Funding for four UK Centres for Clinical Tropical Medicine was renewed (\u00a31.1m).Two Senior Fellowships in ClinicalTropical Medicine were awarded, alongwith two intermediate-level fellowshipsin tropical medicine. Infrastructure Some \u00a37m was awarded for biomedicalresources and large equipment grants.Infrastructure costs also form part ofmany other types of Trust support. New grant initiatives Strategic awards Clinical research infrastructure initiative Engaging Science research awards Livestock for Life public engagement awards. Grants awarded (\u00a3m)Funding highlightsIMMUNOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE The Immunology and Infectious Disease stream aims to increase our knowledge and understanding of the infectious organisms that causedisease in humans and animals, and of the immune systems that fightthese organisms. No. of grants awarded: 229 Value of all grants awarded: \u00a3105.1m New and renewed programme grants (no./value): 16/\u00a319.9m Animal Health in the Developing World awards (no./value): 12/\u00a313m Principal Research Fellow Professor Adrian Hill (University of Oxford) wasawarded five years' further support. The first section of Professor Hill'sprogramme will be to improve vectors,and the antigenic composition of malaria and tuberculosis vaccines , in order to enhance their T-cell immunogenicity andtheir effectiveness. A second part willlook at the genetic basis for susceptibilityto these two diseases. Professor Chris Rudd (Imperial College London) and Professor Steve Fuller(University of Oxford) had the programmegrants associated with their PrincipalResearch Fellowships renewed.Professor Rudd studies immune cell signalling , particularly the signals that link the T-cell receptor and co-receptorswith immunity. Professor Fuller's workfocuses on cryo-electron microscopy of pathogens and receptor complexes.One of his main aims will be to study thestructures of two viruses, Semliki Forestvirus and tick-borne encephalitis virus,and their intermediates during fusion, to reveal the organisation that leads to their very rapid membrane fusion. Among 16 programme grant awards, Professor Gillian Griffiths (University ofOxford), a Senior Research Fellow inBasic Biomedical Science, was fundedfor studies on secretion at theimmunological synapse . study human in which cytotoxic T-lymphocytefunction is impaired, to identify proteinsinvolved in the release of compoundsfrom secretory granules. Professor Massimo Palmarini (University of Glasgow) was awarded a programmegrant to investigate the mechanism bywhich the Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus assembles and releases its viral particles.He will study a mutant virus that has adominant negative interference effect on wild-type virus. A new programme grant will also enable Professor Rick Maizels (University ofEdinburgh) to investigate cellular andmolecular mechanisms of immuneregulation in helminth infections . The programme will attempt to establishwhether the T regulatory cell populationexpansion in helminth infection inhibitsimmunity and whether they come froman already committed cell line or areinduced on infection. A Senior Research Fellowship in Clinical Science was awarded to Dr Helen McShane (University ofOxford) to support her work on noveltuberculosis vaccines . Dr McShane will study the immune response to the new TB vaccine MVA85A and willdevelop a challenge model to studyprotective responses in TB.Also in Oxford, Dr Paul Klenerman (University of Oxford) had his SeniorResearch Fellowship in Clinical Sciencerenewed for five years. Dr Klenermanstudies hepatitis C virus (HCV) ; he has identified differences in the immuneresponse in acute resolving and chronicinfections, and begun to study the roleof T-cell immune escape variants. Henow plans to study the role of T cells in HCV disease in greater detail and to assess the impact of viral variation on disease progression. Viruses are also the focus of Dr Gregory Towers (University CollegeLondon), currently a Research CareerDevelopment Fellow, who was awardeda Senior Research Fellowship in BasicBiomedical Science. During thisfellowship Dr Towers identified TRIM5 as a key mediator of innate immunity to retroviruses . In his senior fellowship, Dr Towers will study the mechanism of action of TRIM5 , and how viruses such as HIV overcome this componentof innate immunity. An International Senior Research Fellowship was awarded to Dr Caroline Tiemessen (Johannesburg),to investigate the innate and acquiredcellular immunity in HIV-seropositive mothers and their infants . By looking at the mother's and the baby's immuneresponses, Dr Tiemessen hopes touncover factors involved in verticaltransmission of the virus and to aid the battle against in utero or intrapartum infection. IMMUNOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE 40IMMUNOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE 41 Wellcome Trust Centre for Molecular Parasitology The Wellcome Trust Centre forMolecular Parasitology at the Universityof Glasgow, led by Professor DaveBarry, carries out research on basicfeatures of parasites, using genetic and molecular technology allied withorganismal biology. The researchincludes work on: African trypanosomes,the causative and Theileria , a protozoan parasite of cattle. TheINSERM unit established at the Centrein 2004 held its official opening duringSeptember 2005. The Centre was also involved in the sequencing of Trypanosoma brucei and the annotation of the 'Tritryp' genomes(see pages 34-35). Further international support went to Dr Amit Sharma and Dr Chetan Chitnis,both Wellcome Trust InternationalSenior Fellows at the InternationalCentre for Genetic Engineering andBiotechnology, New Delhi, India, whowere funded to establish an X-ray crystallographic facility . Dr Gonzalo de Prat Gay (Fundaci\u00f3n Instituto Leloir,Argentina) and Dr Kevin Gaston(University of Bristol) were awarded acollaborative project grant to study themolecular basis for transcription controland genomic DNA replication initiationin human papillomavirus . Among other notable grants, Dr Isobel Smith (University of Cambridge) wasawarded a Research Career Re-entryFellowship to look at the function ofmouse butyrophilin receptors . Dr Smith is returning to science after a career break of nine years. Dr David Beighton (King's CollegeLondon) was awarded a project grantto investigate the fate of bacteria whenthey are sealed underneath a dental restoration . Professor John Britton (University of Nottingham) was awardeda project grant to undertake a trial ofthe effect of therapeutic hookworm infection in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma. Some 12 awards totaling \u00a313m were made through the Animal Healthin the Developing World initiative, whichsupports research on livestock diseasesthat impact significantly on humanhealth and wellbeing in developingcountries. Capacity building was animportant feature of these awards andsupport was provided for training oflocal researchers.Major Overseas Programmes The focus of the Major OverseasProgrammes in Kenya and South-east Asia is to research scientific areas of local significance, to promote science in the regional community (includingtraining programmes) and to informnational policy making. BothProgrammes underwent their five-yearlyreviews in 2005 and were highlypraised for their work in all three areas,receiving the commitment of a furtherthree years of funding. The Programme in Kenya focuses on malaria and infectious diseases of children (pages 11 and 21). TheProgramme is now fully integrated withthe Kenya Medical Research Institute;new laboratories have been completedand will become fully operational duringthe early part of 2006. The South-east Asia Programme comprises units in Thailand andVietnam. Professor Nick White, wholeads the Programme, was awardedthe Royal Society GlaxoSmithKline Prize in 2005. The work in Thailandaims to develop and evaluate effectiveand practical means of diagnosing,treating and preventing significanttropical diseases, including malaria(pages 10-11), melioidosis,leptospirosis and rickettsial infections. Work in Vietnam centres on malaria, dengue, typhoid, central nervoussystem infections and avian flu (page10), and places significant emphasis on encouraging clinical science in the country.MOLECULES, GENES AND CELLS The Molecules, Genes and Cells stream supports high-quality research that will further our understanding of the fundamental biology andspecialist functions of molecular, cellular and genetic processes, and their role in health and disease. No. of grants awarded: 163 Value of all grants awarded: \u00a373m New and renewed programme grants (no./value): 14/\u00a315m A notable trend among awards made was the use of new methods and technologies . For example, an award to Professor Ian Eperon (University ofLeicester) and Professor FrancescoMuntoni (Imperial College) makes use of new methods to rescue theincorporation of silent or defective exonsduring RNA splicing. If successful, thisresearch could be used to treat manydiseases resulting from splicing defects. The use of new technologies was also pivotal to the programme grant awardedto Senior Research Fellow Dr AndrewJarman (University of Edinburgh). DrJarman aims to integrate computationaltechniques to characterise earlyneurogenesis in Drosophila , and to identify the factors that influenceneural stem cell development anddifferentiation. The stream also funded a significant amount of research infrastructure throughout the year. This includedawards for multi-user equipment(plasmon surface resonance and HPLCsystems) to Professor Paul Thornalley(University of Essex) and an award to Senior Research Fellow Dr AlfredAntson (University of York) to set up a facility for X-ray data collection at the York Structural Biology Laboratory. Two awards supported biomedical resources at the University of Cambridge. The first, to ProfessorMalcolm Ferguson-Smith, renewedsupport for the Cambridge ResourceCentre for Comparative Genomics. Thisresource provides chromosome-specificDNA from a wide range of species.Funding was also provided to develop a database to record the comparativemaps generated by cross-specieschromosome painting. The second award, of almost \u00a31.6m, was made to Principal Research Fellow ProfessorDaniel St Johnston of the GurdonInstitute, to establish a Drosophila proteomics resource. The stream made a significant contribution to the Trust's international funding portfolio over the year. This included five new International SeniorResearch Fellows: two in the CzechRepublic, two in Poland and one inIndia. In addition, four collaborativeresearch grants were awarded tofacilitate research between UK andoverseas investigators. A Career Re-entry Fellowship was awarded to Dr Shona Lang (Universityof York) for her study of adult prostaticstem cells. This award will enable Dr Lang to recommence her scientificresearch career after a three-year break.Three new Senior Research Fellowshipswere awarded this year. As well as oneheld in the Wellcome Trust Centre forCell Biology, University of Edinburgh(see box), awards were made to Dr John Strouboulis (Institute of ChildHealth, London) and Dr Hisao Kondo(University of Cambridge). Dr Ben Luisi (University of Cambridge) was awarded the Trust's first '50-50'Senior Research Fellowship, in which theWellcome Trust and the host institutionjointly fund the Fellow's enhanced salaryduring the renewal period. Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium is a large andcomprehensive \u00a38.6m study that aims to uncover the genetic variations associated with 12 common diseases,including tuberculosis, coronary heartdisease, type 1 and type 2 diabetes,rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease,bipolar disorder and hypertension. A supplementary study will look at asmaller number of genetic variations in breast cancer, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune thyroid disease andankylosing spondylitis. The collaboration of 24 leading human geneticists will analyse 20 000 DNAsamples from people with thesedisorders to identify variations in DNAthat may contribute to (or protectagainst) disease. The variations - singlenucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs -will then be compared with DNA takenfrom 3000 healthy controls to uncoverthe differences between the two groups. The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute will generate the genotyping data and theresults will be analysed by statisticalexperts at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics and the Departmentof Statistics in Oxford, and the Universityof Cambridge. JDRF/Wellcome Trust Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory The JDRF/Wellcome Trust Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory (DIL) at the University of Cambridge is a jointinitiative between the Juvenile DiabetesResearch Foundation (JDRF) and theWellcome Trust. It aims to identify thekey genes and pathways involved intype 1 diabetes , and hence to identify and develop targeted treatments and interventions. In late 2004, the DIL was awarded an \u00a38.4m renewal of funding until 2011 from the Trust and the JDRF, includingrenewals of the programme grants ofProfessor David Clayton and ProfessorLinda Wicker. Structural Genomics Consortium By the end of its first year of operationsin July 2005, the Structural GenomicsConsortium, a \u00a346m partnership aimedat determining the 3D structures of proteins of medical importance and placing them in the public domain, haddetermined the structures of 78 novelproteins, significantly exceeding its target of 50 structures (see page 33). MOLECULES, GENES AND CELLS 42MOLECULES, GENES AND CELLS 43 Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute The Gurdon Institute of Cancer andDevelopmental Biology at the Universityof Cambridge, directed by Professor Jim Smith, focuses on two interrelatedaspects of cell biology: how cells acquireand maintain their normal function duringdevelopment, and how they escape fromnormal controls and become cancerous. Following its five-yearly review in January 2005, the Gurdon Institute retainedWellcome Trust Centre status and itscore support was renewed. In June, the Institute hosted an internationalsymposium to mark the opening of itsnew building and to honour the foundingChairman, Professor Sir John Gurdon.Also during the year, Professor Jim Smithwas awarded a programme grant forresearch on vertebrate mesodermformation, and Dr Nancy Papalopulu,who works on Xenopus neurogenesis, had her Senior Research Fellowshiprenewed. See also page 31. www.gurdon.cam.ac.uk Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell-Matrix Research The Wellcome Trust Centre forCell-Matrix Research, led by ProfessorMartin Humphries, is an interdisciplinaryresearch centre embedded within theFaculty of Life Sciences at the Universityof Manchester. The Centre has thelong-term aims of elucidating thestructure and function of extracellularmatrices and cell-matrix adhesions,defining the contribution of cell-matrixinteractions to human diseases, anddeveloping approaches for preventingand treating these diseases.In 2005, the Centre underwent its second five-yearly review. Following a successful review, its Wellcome TrustCentre status was confirmed and coresupport was renewed. Also during the year, the Principal Research Fellowship and associatedprogramme grant of Professor MartinHumphries were renewed, and aprogramme grant was awarded toProfessor Karl Kadler for research on the spatial organisation of collagen fibrils. www.ls.manchester.ac.uk/wtccmr/ Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics The Wellcome Trust Centre for HumanGenetics at the University of Oxford,directed by Professor Tony Monaco,undertakes research into the geneticbasis of common diseases. Manycommon diseases, such as psychiatricdisorders, infectious diseases, heartdisease and diabetes, have both geneticand environmental causes. The goal of the Centre is to identify the geneticfactors that influence our susceptibility to diseases, and thus to understandbetter the underlying biological processand how these genetic factors interactwith the environment to cause disease. During the past year, core support for the Centre was renewed, as were the Principal Research Fellowships ofProfessor Monaco and Professor AdrianHill. The programme grant of anotherPrincipal Research Fellow, ProfessorStephen Fuller, was also renewed. Professor Dominic Kwiatkowski received an award from the Grand Challenges in Global Health initiative (of which theWellcome Trust is part) to integrate andbuild on the work of malaria researchgroups around the world through the formation of the Malaria GenomicEpidemiology Network. PrincipalResearch Fellow Professor Lon Cardonwas awarded funds as part of anotherlarge-scale collaborative project, theWellcome Trust Case ControlConsortium (see main text). www.well.ox.ac.uk Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology The Wellcome Trust Centre for CellBiology at the University of Edinburgh,led by Professor Adrian Bird, seeks to understand the fundamentalcharacteristics of living things at thecellular level, such as growth, movement,self-replication and development. It has particular strengths in: the study of RNA, including its transcription,processing, transport and destruction;the cell division cycle, focusing on the structure and segregation ofchromosomes; and gene expression in developing systems, particularlyepigenetic processes such as DNA methylation. During the year, two new Trust-funded group leaders have been appointed: Dr Eric Schirmer was awarded a SeniorResearch Fellowship (role of the nuclearenvelope in genome architecture andcellular differentiation), and Dr AdeleMarston was awarded a ResearchCareer Development Fellowship (controlof chromosome segregation duringmeiosis). Professor Adrian Bird'sprogramme grant, for studies on methyl-CpG binding proteins and theirrole in DNA methylation, was renewed. www.wcb.ed.ac.ukNEUROSCIENCE AND MENTAL HEALTH The Neuroscience and Mental Health funding stream aims to support high-quality research into the function of the nervous system in health and disease. No. of grants awarded: 133 Value of all grants awarded: \u00a337.3m New and renewed programme grants (no./value): 7/\u00a36.1m The Principal Research Fellowship of Professor Tony Monaco (University of Oxford) was renewed, enabling himto continue his attempts to identifysusceptibility genes for specific reading and language disorders. Children with language development problems arelikely also to have difficulties in reading,and Professor Monaco will study a cohort of individuals affected by aspectrum of relevant disorders, with the ultimate aim of elucidating theneurodevelopmental pathwaysimplicated and giving insight intopotential therapies. Dr Mairead MacSweeney (Institute of Child Health, London) was awarded a Research Career DevelopmentFellowship in Basic Biomedical Science.She will examine the impact of late sign language acquisition on language processing and reading ability in deafpeople. Similarly, Professor GeraldAltmann (University of York) and Dr KateNation (University of Oxford) wereawarded a project grant for studies intothe neurobiological bases of language . They will investigate language processingin a group of children with poor languagecomprehension. This research aims todevelop procedures that will help suchchildren to improve their reading abilities. Professor Andrew King (University of Oxford) was awarded a PrincipalResearch Fellowship to study the basisof perceptual learning in the auditory cortex . He aims to identify those brain regions involved in sound localisationand to determine the capacity of the mature brain to recover functions compromised following hearing loss. This research will contribute to ourunderstanding of cochlear transplantation and will help to establish whetherbehavioural training can be used topromote the rehabilitation of hearing in deaf individuals. In this field, Professor Tim Griffiths (University of Newcastle upon Tyne) had his Senior Research Fellowship in Clinical Science renewed. Hisresearch addresses the question of how complex sound information is processed by brain systemsimplicated in language, memory andemotion. He will analyse critical braincomponents using functional imagingexperiments with individuals affected by brain disorders that influence soundperception, such as schizophrenia. The Senior Research Fellowship in Clinical Science of Dr Masud Husain(University College London) was alsorenewed. Dr Husain studies spatialneglect, a common disabling disorderfound in the majority of stroke cases (see pages 12-13). It is characterisedby a lack of awareness ('neglect') ofobjects or people on the side of thebody opposite the damaged area of thebrain. Neglect can hamper rehabilitationin some individuals. Dr Husain aims to identify the functional componentsunderlying neglect, to discover whetherparticular brain regions are selectivelydamaged, and to identify functional or anatomical factors associated withpoor recovery. A major joint award with the Medical Research Council was also made in the area of behavioural and clinical neuroscience to Professor Trevor Robbins and Professor Edward Bullmoreat the University of Cambridge. The award will provide infrastructure support to facilitate the translation ofbasic research into clinical application.The scientific focus of the research is the function of key brain structures and circuits that are implicated in thepathophysiological changesunderpinning major neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders, such asdepression, schizophrenia, Parkinson'sdisease and Alzheimer's disease. In the field of basic biomedical sciences , Professor Hugh Willison (University of Glasgow) was awarded a programme grant to take further hisstudies of the pathogenetic mechanismsof Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Thisinflammatory nervous system disease is a leading cause of neuromuscularparalysis. This multidisciplinaryprogramme aims to elucidate in parallelthe mechanisms of tissue damage inanimal models and in humans, in orderto develop therapeutic approaches. An International Senior Research Fellowship was awarded to Dr NorbertHaj\u00f3s, who will be working at theUniversity of Budapest in Hungary on the molecular basis of endocannabinoid signalling in neuronal communication.Endocannabinoids are endogenousmetabolites that have been implicated inanalgesia and mood-changing behaviour.The experiments will be specificallyperformed in those brain regions wherecannabinoids may influence memoryformation and anxiety-like symptoms. In another area, Dr Alexandra Chittka (King's College London) was awarded a Career Re-entry Fellowship. Her workis aimed at understanding the role inpathological pain conditions of PRDM4, a molecule expressed duringdevelopment in nociceptive neurons. NEUROSCIENCE AND MENTAL HEALTH 44PHYSIOLOGICAL SCIENCES 45 No. of grants awarded: 104 Value of all grants awarded: \u00a327.6m New and renewed programme grants (no./value): 16/\u00a38.7m Awards made through the Physiological Sciences funding stream havecontinued to illustrate the broad rangeof applications received. Awards weremade in such diverse areas as sleep apnoea (Dr Mary Morrell, Imperial College London, who is studying theinfluence of the ageing process oncardiovascular activation in obstructivesleep apnoea) and dermatology (Professor Jonathan Rees, University ofEdinburgh, who is investigating scratchand itch in individuals with skin disease). A major joint award with ICICI Ltd and the Parthenon Trust was made to Dr Caroline Fall (University ofSouthampton). She aims to develop an evidence-based nutritional intervention to reduce low birth weight in a poor urban setting in India.The plan is to enhance the micronutrientquality of women's diets, beforeconception and throughout pregnancy,using locally available foods (samosas),with a view to increasing fetal survivaland growth, and reducing infantmortality. The longer-term aim of thisstudy is to improve the wellbeing ofwomen and children living in poverty and overcrowded conditions in an urban environment. There were several awards made during the year in related areas of respiratory disease . Notable among these was the award of a programme grant toProfessor Peter Barnes (Imperial CollegeLondon) for his studies on the role ofhistone deacetylase-2 in the regulation of inflammation and corticosteroidsensitivity in chronic obstructivepulmonary disease (COPD). This programme will examine the underlyingcause of steroid resistance in COPDwith the hope of leading to a betterunderstanding of the inflammatorymechanisms of the disease and to more effective treatments. Another award in a related area was made to Professor John Dark(University of Newcastle upon Tyne), who is investigating the mechanisms and time-course of donor lung injurydevelopment following brain death, andamelioration of lung reperfusion injury bydonor treatment. The aim is to uncoverthe causes of organ injury in brain-deaddonors, with the hope of improving theavailability of organs for transplantation. Also in this area, Research Training Fellowships were awarded to Dr Rachel Davies (University ofCambridge) to establish the connectionbetween a mutation in BMPR-II and the narrowing and occlusion of bloodvessels in the lung, as seen inpulmonary arterial hypertension, and to Dr Christopher Johnson (University of Cambridge) to look for variants of a specific subset of majorhistocompatibility complex genes andassess whether they are associatedwith sarcoidosis (inflammation of thelymph nodes, spleen and other organs). A second general theme of musculoskeletal research also emerged during the year. ProfessorJennifer Kirkham (University of Leeds)was awarded a programme grant for her study of odontogenesis (toothformation), a paradigm of mammalianbiomineralisation and the role ofextracellular matrix in the control of crystal deposition and growth. This proposal aims to provide newinformation to elucidate mechanisms ofbiomineralisation in mammalian skeletaltissues and the role of matrix proteins in the maintenance of human health and skeleto-pathogenesis. Professor Lance Lanyon (Royal Veterinary College) was also awarded a programme grant to continue hisresearch on the adaptive control of bonestrength. In particular, his proposal willexplore the mechanisms involved in thestrain-adaptive process, such as howthe effects of oestrogen and strainregulate the number or activity ofoestrogen receptors, and how theseresponses are related to the responsesof bone cells to a range of otherinfluences affecting bone mass. In a related field, Dr Keith Baar (University of Dundee) was awarded a 'new investigator' project grant for his study into the role of mTOR/PDK1-activated protein kinases in thedevelopment of skeletal musclehypertrophy. This proposal focuses on a family of proteins that may play arole in the ability of muscle to respond to resistance exercise. By elucidating the molecular events required for thedevelopment of skeletal musclehypertrophy, he hopes to identifymolecular targets for pharmacologicaltreatments of loss of muscle mass dueto ageing and chronic illness. In addition, Dr Kuda Ranatunga (University of Bristol) was awarded a project grant to investigate thecorrelation between the molecular basisof muscle contraction and musclebehaviour at physiological temperatures.The proposal aims to shed light on howmuscles change their behaviour at lowtemperatures, important in conditionssuch as hypothermia, and at hightemperatures, including during strenuous exercise. PHYSIOLOGICAL SCIENCES The Physiological Sciences funding stream aims to support high-quality basic and clinical research relevant to the understanding of biologicalprocesses at the cell, organ, system and whole-animal levels in health and disease.POPULATIONS AND PUBLIC HEALTH The Populations and Public Health stream supports research to improve understanding of the determinants of disease and quality of life inpopulations, and to provide a sound evidence base to inform decisions in public health and healthcare delivery. No. of grants awarded: 61 Value of all grants awarded: \u00a312.3m New and renewed programme grants (no./value): 2/\u00a31.1m (Figures include grants awarded through the Health Consequencesof population Change Programme,a five-year initiative begun in 2001.) This year, awards were made for research into a range of major public health issues in developing countries and in Europe. For example, ProfessorLinda Richter received an award forcontinuing studies of a longitudinalcohort of urban South African youth('Birth to Twenty Cohort'), which hasalready been followed for 14 years. The new studies will look at the crucial time of adolescence and the determinants of adverse healthoutcomes related to sexuality,reproduction and chronic diseases. A collaborative network for analysis of data across community-based studies of HIV in Africa will add value to severallongitudinal Trust-funded projects(including the 'Africa Centre' ledby Ms Basia Zaba of the London Schoolof Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, whowill be relocating to Tanzania. A project led by Professor Bruce Neal of the George Institute, Sydney, Australia,will test new ways of collecting andreporting information about trends incauses of death in countries with limitedresources. The study will take place inIndia and could help developing-countrygovernments to plan health servicesmore effectively.Dr Vikram Patel (Institute of Psychiatry) and Dr Michael English (University ofOxford), who both previously heldWellcome Trust intermediate fellowships,were awarded Senior Clinical Fellowshipsin Tropical Medicine for their work onmental healthcare in India and onhealthcare delivery for severely ill childrenin Kenya respectively. At the intermediatelevel, Dr Anna Hansell (Imperial CollegeSchool of Medicine) was awarded aClinical Fellowship to study air pollutionin the UK, while Dr Shakoor Hajat(London School of Hygiene and TropicalMedicine) will be studying the impacts ofheatwaves on mortality in Europe underhis Research Career DevelopmentFellowship. One Training Fellowship, one PhD Studentship and six Master'sawards were also supported. Africa Centre A major review of the Africa Centre forHealth and Population Studies in SouthAfrica, which the Wellcome Trust hasfunded since 1998, took place in 2005. The Africa Centre has successfully established one of the most detaileddemographic information systemsin Africa, gathering data on births,deaths, migration and socioeconomicstatus in a population of 90 000 peoplein a rural area of KwaZulu-Natal severelyaffected by HIV. The Africa Centre now intends to build on this platform with further studies ofHIV, covering the determinants ofdisease, delivery of anti-retroviral drugs in rural areas, the effects of the epidemicon households and social structures,and prevention of HIV infection. Corefunding has been agreed for two yearsuntil 2007, with funding for an additionalthree years being dependent on further development of the Centre'sscientific plans. Professor Marie-Louise Newell has been appointed the Africa Centre's new Director. ALSPAC The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parentsand Children (ALSPAC) is a cohort studyof 14 000 children (and their parents)born in the Avon area between 1 April1991 and 31 December 1992. It wasestablished by Professor Jean Golding(University of Bristol) and ProfessorMarcus Pembrey. ALSPAC is a unique resource with a major strength in intensive phenotyping,allowing the study of continuous traits(such as cognitive functions), psychosis-like symptoms, and common childhooddiseases including asthma and obesity. Since the retirement of Professor Golding in July 2005, the project has been led byProfessor George Davey-Smith underthe auspices of the University of Bristol'sCentre for Lifecourse and GeneticEpidemiology. A renewal of a five-yeargrant for core support of over \u00a38.5mwas jointly agreed by the MedicalResearch Council and the WellcomeTrust in July 2005. UK Biobank UK Biobank is the long-term prospectivelongitudinal study of 500 000 healthyvolunteers aged 40-69. UK Biobank has been developing the infrastructure to support the project and further refiningexperimental protocols; the full-scalelaunch is scheduled for 2006. Professor Rory Collins, of the Clinical Trials Surveillance Unit, University ofOxford, was appointed Chief Executiveand Principal Investigator in September 2005. POPULATIONS AND PUBLIC HEALTH 46MEDICAL HUMANITIES 47 No. of grants awarded: 154 Value of all grants awarded: \u00a315.8m History of medicine The breadth of the history of medicineprogramme is well illustrated by thediversity of topics featuring in awardsmade during the year. These included'Medicine and Society in Tenth-CenturyBaghdad' (Dr Peter Pormann, Universityof Care in of Oxford) and 'Road TrafficAccidents' (Dr W Luckin, University of Bolton). Dr Mark Harrison, Director of the Wellcome Unit for the History ofMedicine at the University of Oxford,was awarded the 2004 Templer Medal (see page 14). More unusual outputs included a film, Trafalgar Battle Surgeon , made by Justin Hardy of Asylum Films, with help from Professor Laurence Brockliss(University of Oxford). This publicengagement award resulted in a one-hour film shown on Channel 4, as wellas a scholarly work entitled Nelson's Surgeon (Laurence Brockliss, John Cardwell, and Michael Moss; OxfordUniversity Press). In addition, the OralHistory of Diabetes in the 20th Centuryproject launched an informative webresource (see page 34). Research Resources in Medical History This scheme funds projects cataloguing,preserving, conserving or digitisingimportant archival collections. Highlightsof this year's funding included the GreatOrmond Street Hospital DatabaseProject, which involved the creation of a database to hold all the transcribedinformation from the hospital's admissions registers up to 1914. The preservation of clinical case notes in the Lothian Health Services Archivehas ensured the long-term stability of avast collection of the folder-based casenotes of clinical professors, which werein increasingly poor condition. Biomedical ethics The biomedical ethics programmeconsists of two strands: UK-basedfunding supporting research on theethical, legal, social or public policyaspects of advances in biomedicalscience, and a research ethics schemeaimed at developing countries. The Trust also organised the 6th Global Forum on Bioethics in Research(see page 15), as well as a biomedical ethics summer school, 'Neuroscience,Ethics and Society', held in Oxford inSeptember 2005. This four-day eventenabled junior researchers to exploreethical issues in neuroscience andmental health, and develop ideas forresearch proposals. It attracted high-profile speakers from neuroscience andneuroethics, and went some way todeveloping a research and trainingagenda in neuroethics for the UK. Grants awarded during the year covered many of the key issues inbiomedical research and its application,including mental capacity in individualswith psychiatric disorders (Dr MatthewHotopf, Institute of Psychiatry), geneticdatabases (Professor Michael Parker,University of Oxford), 'trial communities'in developing countries (Dr P WenzelGeissler, London School of Hygiene andTropical Medicine), and philosophicalperspectives on responsibility andpersonality disorders (Dr Luca Malatesti,University of Hull). MEDICAL HUMANITIES The Medical Humanities stream aims to enhance understanding of the historical and social context of medicine and biomedical science. Itsupports research in history of medicine and biomedical ethics, andencourages use of findings, for example to inform public policy making. Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine After a successful review in April 2005,the Centre was awarded five years' corefunding of from 2004/05 Fractured States: Smallpox, Public Health and VaccinationPolicy in British India, 1800-1947 (with Mark Harrison and Michael Worboys;Orient Longman, India, and SangamBooks, UK); Jordan Goodman's The Rattlesnake: A Voyage of Discovery to the Coral Sea (Faber and Faber); Christopher Lawrence's Rockefeller Money, the Laboratory and Medicine inEdinburgh 1919-1930: New Science inan Old Country (University of Rochester Press); and Medieval Chinese Medicine (RoutledgeCurzon), edited by VivienneLo and Christopher Cullen. The Centre also published the record of four Wellcome Witness Seminars:'Innovation in Pain Management', 'TheRhesus Factor and Disease Prevention','The Recent History of Platelets inThrombosis and Other Disorders', and 'Short-course Chemotherapy forTuberculosis'. Staff at the Centre alsomade numerous appearances ontelevision and radio during the year.TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER Technology Transfer at the Wellcome Trust seeks to maximise the impact of research innovations on health by facilitating the development of early-stage projects to a point at which they can be developed further by the market. Technology Transfer at the Wellcome Trust aims to fundprojects that are too early to attractventure capital or to be seen byindustry as credible in-licensingopportunities. Over a period ofseven years, around 70 translationalresearch projects from 46institutions have been funded underDevelopment Fund and TranslationAward schemes. Many of thesehave raised additional investmentand a number have alreadydeveloped products, although it is still too early to appreciate thefull impact of the funding provided. The Wellcome Trust has two forms of translational research supportadministered through TechnologyTransfer. Translation Awards are a response-mode form of support. They are used to support a diverse array of technologies, not only from biologybut also from the physical sciences andmathematics. The common requirementsare that the research is aimed at theimprovement of health and that theproject can be advanced to a point at which it represents an attractiveproposition for follow-on support by a third party. Academic institutions andearly-stage companies can apply forthese awards, and projects are directlymanaged by the institution or company. Of 48 applications received from 33 institutions, 29 per cent were funded,covering applicants in both universitydepartments and small businesses. The mean value of these awards hasbeen \u00a3336 356 (ranging from \u00a320 000 to \u00a3896 366) and the average duration24 months (ranging from six to 36months); the average time fromapplication to decision has beenaround three to four months. The projects address a wide range of potential applications, includingtherapeutics, vaccines, diagnostics andmedical devices. Others were in supportof new platform technologies. One awardwas made to investigate the effectivenessof policy tools for promoting translation in the neglected diseases, while anotherwas to run workshops in intellectualproperty for scientists working indeveloping countries. Strategic Translation Awards are designed to support translationalresearch in areas of key importance to the Wellcome Trust. These may betechnologies that have a particular role in support of the Trust's mission andaddress an unmet need in healthcare,and where it is felt that TechnologyTransfer can add value by providingproject management support or bysecuring follow-on funding. Six Strategic Translation Award applications have been considered to date, in diagnostics, vaccination,tools for genome analysis and drugdiscovery - the last of these in bothconventional commercial markets(central nervous system and metabolicdisease) and tropical diseases(parasitic protozoan infections). The mean value of awards has been\u00a32.5 million (ranging from \u00a3519 000 to \u00a38.1 million). A new initiative, Seeding Drug Discovery , designed to advance translational research in small moleculesacross a broad range of therapeuticareas, has been recently announced as a focus for further Strategic TranslationAward support. Professor Mike Ferguson and colleagues at the University of Dundeewere awarded \u00a38.1 million (the largestStrategic Translation Award to date) to advance their work developing newtherapies for neglected diseases, such as African sleeping sickness, Chagas'disease and leishmaniasis, which attractlittle or no interest from pharmaceuticalcompanies. The Dundee team's goal is to translate the insights arising from basicresearch into candidate drugs, takingthem to a point at which public-privatepartnerships or the commercial sectorcan develop them further. There has been encouraging progress in a number of the projects supportedthrough Technology Transfer funding.Examples include: the of aminiaturised adenosine triphosphatesensor (by Sarissa Biomedical Ltd, aspin-out of the University of Warwick);the development of a compact videolaryngoscope (by Aircraft Medical Ltd,based in Edinburgh); and the creation of powerful new software for medicaldevices (by CardioDigital Ltd, based inEdinburgh) and for biomarker research(by BlueGnome Ltd, based at theUniversity of Cambridge). In addition, several small companies that have received Wellcome Trust supportduring early validation of theirtechnologies have had success raisingfurther funds. These include CellTran Ltd,DanioLabs Ltd, Diagnostics for the RealWorld, Novacta Biosystems Ltd, ProXaraBiotechnology Ltd and Senexis. Finally, a report titled 'The New Landscape of Neglected Disease DrugDevelopment', produced by a group atthe London School of Economics, waspublished in the second half of the yearand is already proving highly influential(see page 20). TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER 48WELLCOME TRUST GENOME CAMPUS 49 Buildings providing additional laboratory space and research andsupport facilities for the GenomeCampus were completed in summer2005, the culmination of a projectbegun in 2002. The buildings havebeen carefully landscaped tominimise their environmentalimpact. Among other 'green'initiatives, a Wetlands NatureReserve has been establishedaround the river Cam, providinghabitats for many rare species and a peaceful environment forlocal residents. Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute A world-leading provider of genomicdata, information and biologicalresources, the Wellcome Trust SangerInstitute is continuing to increase itsfocus on high-throughput biological studies . Sequence generation continues to be a major activity, however: by year-end, the Sanger Institute had producednearly 3 billion bases of finished DNAsequence, the largest of any publicbody. The Sanger Institute is increasinglyfocusing sequencing activities onbiological and medical questions, and strategic plans for 2006-11 willaccelerate programmes in these areas. In human genomic biology , the Sanger Institute was a principal participant in theInternational HapMap Consortium, whichdeveloped a resource to speed genediscovery in biomedicine. The Institutealso led the international team thatpublished the sequence of the human X chromosome, which contains clues to human evolution, the origins ofchromosomal sex determination, and many genes implicated in disease.Other research included studies oncopy-number variation - how somehumans may have more DNA thanothers - and the origins of the peoples of Madagascar.Pathogen genome research has focused on diseases that affect hugenumbers of humans and animals, such as the 'tritryps' (see pages 34-35).Other projects target organisms thathave a significant economic impact indeveloping countries, exacerbating theproblems caused thegenome of Theileria annulata , one of a genus that threatens 250 million cattlefrom Africa to Asia. The sequence isbeing used by other Wellcome Trust-funded researchers to search for new treatments. Well-established Sanger Institute resources showed remarkable growth.The data downloaded from the Ensemblgenome browser increased by 20 percent year-on-year, and visits to all SangerInstitute sites also increased by 20 percent. Of new resources, more than 1800MICER clones, which can be used todelete or duplicate regions of the mousegenome, have been dispatched, andnearly 400 gene-trap cell lines, whichenable investigators to create mutantmice, are distributed each year. The Sanger Institute's publications in 2005, which include eight in Nature and 12 in Science , increasingly reflect post-genomic research such asstudies on DNA replication, hearing,cognition, evolution, embryology andepigenetics. Of 221 papers in 2005 to date, 12 covered studies on cancer.The Sanger Institute's strategic plan for2006-11 is designed to build on thesestrong foundations in genome-basedbiological research. Wellcome Trust Conference Centre Partnerships and internationalcollaboration continued to be a keycomponent of the Wellcome first four events wereheld jointly with Cold Spring HarborLaboratory in the USA, the last onejointly with the European Commission. A smaller meeting to discuss technologyroadmapping for malaria was also heldjointly with the Gates Foundation and the Malaria Vaccine Initiative. The Wellcome Trust Conference Centre continues to increase in popularity, withover \u00a31.3m of meetings held this year.Meetings whose primary purpose isscientific are run at discounted rates. Wellcome Trust Advanced Courses Wellcome Trust Advanced Coursesprovide hands-on training in the latestlaboratory techniques and related ITapplications for PhD students,postdoctoral scientists and clinicians.The Courses are held in laboratories in the Sanger Institute. Five Advanced Courses were held in on molecular geneticstechniques for clinicians. In addition,four IT-based courses were run scientists training ingenome analysis software. The programme is being expanded for 2005/06, with seven Advanced Courses,four Open Door Workshops in Hinxton,one Open Door Workshop in Uruguay,and, in conjunction with Cold SpringHarbor, two Open Door Workshops in Brazil and Mexico. WELLCOME TRUST GENOME CAMPUS The Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, at Hinxton, near Cambridge, is home to the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, the Wellcome TrustConference Centre and Wellcome Trust Advanced Courses. PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT The Wellcome Trust's Public Engagement activities aim to raise awareness and understanding of biomedical science, its social and ethical implications, and its historical context. As well as 42 small People Awards, eight Society Awards (of \u00a350 000 and above) were made under the \u00a33 million public engagementgrants scheme, Engaging Science. Society Awards for research were launched in September 2005, to supportacademic research designed to advanceknowledge about public engagementwith biomedical science. Animal Health in the Developing World: Livestock For Life, a \u00a33 million grantscheme to strengthen links betweenlivestock keepers, practitioners,researchers, policy makers and otherstakeholders working in the field ofinternational animal health, was launched in June 2005. Some 140 applications were received under the Sciart scheme, which offers up to \u00a3500 000 per year to supportinnovative arts projects investigatingbiomedical science and its socialcontexts. Three Production Awards (of \u00a350 000 upwards) and ten Research and Development awards (of up to \u00a315 000) were made. In October 2004, the Wellcome Trust contributed to six of the 17 awardsmade to science centres and otherinstitutions throughout the UK in roundthree of ReDiscover, and in March 2005contributed to eight of 20 awards madein the fourth and final round. ReDiscoveris a joint venture between the MillenniumCommission, the Wellcome Trust and the Wolfson Foundation, set up toenable museums and science centres to refresh their exhibitions. Twelve awards were made in May 2005 under the second round of Pulse -a funding initiative supporting youngpeople's arts projects inspired bybiomedical science. Pulse 2 continued to fund performing arts projects, butextended the challenge to other artforms, including visual arts, film, creativewriting and new media. The Wellcome Trust and the BBC ran a second 'Imagine' photographiccompetition in 2004/05, based on thetheme: 'How biomedical science us'. Winning entries weredisplayed at the Royal Albert Hall,London, and at science centres around the UK in 2005. Future Face - the final exhibition in a series mounted by the Wellcome Trust at the Science Museum - ran from 1 October 2004 to 13 February 2005 (see page 25). Touch Me , a Wellcome Trust-funded exhibition at the Victoriaand Albert Museum (16 June to 29August 2005), explored the pleasuresand sensations of touch. The refurbishedHunterian Museum of the Royal Collegeof Surgeons was re-opened by HerRoyal Highness The Princess Royal on 9 February 2005 (see page 26). Education Construction of the National ScienceLearning Centre in York was completedin 2005 (see pages 24-25). A major piece of research on UK primary science education was published on 12 September 2005. The WellcomeTrust commissioned Queen's UniversityBelfast and St Mary's University CollegeBelfast to explore teachers' views andexperiences of primary science, and to recommend ways in which it could be improved. The Wellcome Trust part-funded the creation of three programmes forTeachers' TV, the new digital TV channelfor teachers launched in February 2005.The programmes, which explored stemcells, HIV/AIDS and the Cancer GenomeProject, were made by the productioncompany Glasshead, to support thenew Wellcome-funded science GCSE,'Twenty First Century Science'. Consultations and debate Two public consultation reports werepublished in August 2005. 'Informationand Attitudes: Consulting the publicabout biomedical science' and 'What do People Think about Gene Therapy?',a survey of public knowledge of andattitudes to gene therapy and its socialand ethical implications. Three innovative methods of debate were funded by the Trust in 2004/05(see pages 26-27). PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT 50LIBRARY AND INFORMATION RESOURCES 51 The Library 'Turning the Pages', an award-winninginteractive technology developed by the British Library, was installed at theWellcome Library at 210 Euston Road in May 2005. The technology enablesreaders to 'turn' the pages of three rareand beautiful works from the Library'srare book, Asian and manuscriptholdings, to examine them in detail, andto read or listen to commentaries. Themanuscripts can also be viewed online. A previously unknown recording of a speech made by Florence Nightingale in support of the Light Brigade Relief inJuly 1890 has been restored and madeavailable in collaboration with the BritishLibrary, which is preserving the originalfragile wax cylinder. A digitally enhancedversion of the recording is available on its Voices of History CD. The Wellcome Library and the US National Library of Medicine workedtogether to digitise materials from Francis Crick's personal archive andmake them available to view over theinternet. Digitised materials include apencil sketch showing first impressionsof the famous DNA double helix, thetelegram informing Crick that he hadwon the Nobel Prize in 1962 and lettersfrom schoolchildren asking for advice on how to \"be a good scientist\". The most outstanding images recently acquired for the Wellcome Library'sMedical Photographic Library werehighlighted at the Biomedical ImageAwards 2005 ceremony, which took place in the Wellcome Library in July 2005. Many of the treasures from the Library's Asian Collections were featured in theWellcome Trust-funded exhibition Asia: Body Mind Spirit , which focused on health and wellbeing in Asia, and ranfrom 13 October to 12 December 2004.The exhibition was held at the BruneiGallery at London University's School ofOriental and African Studies (SOAS) andwas a collaboration between AsiaHouse, the Wellcome Library and SOAS. Biomedical information Significant progress was made duringthe year on the Medical DigitisationProject, a partnership with the JointInformation Systems Committee (JISC)and the National Library of Medicine(NLM) to digitise material from medicaljournals. Funding from the WellcomeTrust and JISC will allow the project to digitise at least 1.7 million pages,which will be freely available viaPubMed Central. Web-based content presents new archiving challenges, due to itsephemeral nature. The WellcomeLibrary has been a leading member of a project assessing the feasibility of systematic archiving of importantwebsites. A searchable archive ofwebsites selected for their scholarly,cultural and scientific value is nowavailable at www.webarchive.org.uk.Developed by the UK Web Archiving Consortium (UKWAC) - the BritishLibrary, JISC, the National Archives, theNational Library of Wales, the NationalLibrary of Scotland and the WellcomeTrust - the project has archived 299titles and 1090 individual web sites,collecting 84 GB of data. Publishing The Trust launched two new publicationsin 2005. Wellcome Science , to be published three times a year, provides in-depth reviews of the most excitingresearch funded by the Wellcome Trust,plus guides and insight into the latestscientific discoveries. Wellcome Focus , published once a year, provides an overview to a particular areaof medicine and key areas of researchwithin it. The first issue, Antibiotic Resistance: An unwinnable war? , explored the science and medical impactof microbial resistance and how researchis tackling it. Two issues in the Big Picture series were published - on obesity and nanoscience(see page 24). Dengue , the latest CD-ROM in the Trust's award-winning Topics in International Health series, waspublished in 2005. It was developed in collaboration with the UNICEF-UNDP-World Bank-WHO SpecialProgramme for Research and Trainingin Tropical Diseases (TDR). LIBRARY AND INFORMATION RESOURCES The Wellcome Library provides free public access to more than a million items related to the history of health, disease and medicine. The WellcomeTrust also works to enhance access to key information resources andpublishes material in a range of formats for a variety of audiences.ADVISORY COMMITTEES Animal Health in the Developing
