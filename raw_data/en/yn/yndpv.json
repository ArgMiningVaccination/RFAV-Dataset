E-mail: aaggarwal@mcvh-vcu.eduObjectives : To determine the role of numeracy on cancer screen-ing knowledge and practicesamong an ethnically diverse popu-lation. Methods : Women aged 40+ presenting for primary care at anurban academic medical was usedto determine if women were up-to-date with breast and colorectal cancer screening. Results : Ad-equate numeracy was associated with increasing age, white race,higher education, and knowledgeof breast cancer screening guide-lines. No association was found between numeracy and cancerscreening practices. Conclu- sions : Adequate numeracy was not a key determinant of cancerscreening. Key words : numeracy, literacy, breast cancer, cancer,and screening. Am J Health Behav . 2007;31(Suppl 1):S57-S68 Early detection of breast and colorectal cancer, the second and third lead- ing causes of cancer death among US women respectively, can save lives, reduce length of treatment, and increase quality of life.1 In the year 2000, 70% of women 40 and older had undergone a screening mammography as recom-mended, whereas only 37% of women over 50 had undergone a recommended colorectal screening.2-4 Despite an overall reduction in mortality from these can- cers due to improved treatment options and use of screening, certain womencontinue to suffer from poor outcomes. 5 In particular, African American women tend to present with more ad-vanced stage of disease and have higher mortality rates. 6-8 Furthermore, lower socioeconomic status along with spe-cific cultural beliefs and attitudes have been associated with late-stage pre- sentation for both breast and colorectalcancer, and disparities in cancer screening rates may explain some of these disparate outcomes. 9-17,6-11 Accord- ing to the National Health Interview Sur- vey, mammography screening rates in women over 40 years of age have im-proved among both whites and blacks. 12 However, black women continue to dem-Numeracy and Cancer Screening S58onstrate lower rates than compared to white women. This racial disparity is even more pronounced for colorectal can-cer: black women are 18% less likely to receive colonoscopy and 39% less likely to receive flexible sigmoidoscopy after con-trolling for age, sex, income, and access to care. 8 Meanwhile, a systematic review of US studies on the prevalence of limited health literacy in health care settings revealed that 26% (95% CI 22% to 29%) of Ameri-can adults had low health literacy and an additional 20% (95% CI 16% to 23%) had marginal health literacy. 13 The preva- lence of limited health literacy among American adults presents an important challenge for clinicians, who are expectedto facilitate discussion of health risk in- formation especially in preventive care and cancer screening where risk com-munication may be presented with a se- ries of numbers, rates, and percentages. 14 Low literacy has been found to correlate with less health knowledge, worse self- management skills, less use of preventa- tive tactics, higher rates of hospitaliza-tion, and death. 15,16 Individuals with low literacy may find themselves unable to read prescription labels; health educa-tion materials; test results, appointment reminders; and other important, but ba- sic, documents. 13,17 Current organizational guidelines rec- ommend personalized discussion of health risk information as part of the standard ofcare to help patients make decisions about cancer screening. 3,18 Most of this information is presented to the patient inthe form of data collected as percentages and probabilities. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) definesnumeracy as a quantitative domain of literacy. Numeracy or quantitative literacy is defined as the knowledge and skillsneeded to understand the fundamental notions of numbers and chance. 19 Numeracy includes the ability to perform calculations and to decipher numbers embedded in text, as well as the ability to handle numbers when writing or fillingout forms. In 2003, the National Adult Health Lit- eracy Survey (NAALS), a nationally repre-sentative household survey administered by the National Center for Education Sta- tistics, showed that 22% of all Americanadults surveyed exhibited the lowest level of numeracy. 19 The prevalence of below-basic numeracy skills is associated with race/ethnicity: 13% of whites, 47% of blacks, and 50% of Hispanics, exhibitbelow-basic numeracy skills. 19 The dis- proportionate representation of low numeracy among American adults andthe possibility that numeracy may influ- ence cancer screening suggest a poten- tial explanation of racial and ethnic dis-parities seen in cancer screening. Though prior research has found numeracy to be a strong predictor of accu-rately gauging the benefits of mammog- raphy, to our knowledge there is no litera- ture addressing the role of numeracy onknowledge of cancer screening guide- lines and screening practices. 20 There- fore, we surveyed a racially and ethni-cally diverse population of urban women to investigate whether patients' numeracy status affects knowing aboutrecommended cancer screening guide- lines and being up-to-date with these screening practices. METHODS Data CollectionWe utilized data from a self-adminis- tered cross-sectional survey developed to study racial/ethnic differences in cancerrisk perception and screening behavior among urban women. Consecutive women presenting for primary care at 4 ambula-tory care sites of an urban academic medical center between August 2004 and July 2005 were eligible. The recruitmentsites included 2 hospital-based practices and 2 community health centers. After receiving institutional review board ap-proval, English-speaking research assis- tants approached eligible women as they presented for scheduled visits and invitedthem to participate. The survey was of- fered in English, Spanish or Haitian Cre- ole. After giving written informed con-sent, participants completed an 85-item written survey in the exam room with a research assistant available to answerparticipant questions. Approximately 15 minutes were needed to complete the survey, and no incentive was provided. Eligibility Criteria Women were eligible for participation if they were 40 years or older and had the ability to speak and read English, Span- ish, or Haitian Creole. Women were ex-cluded if they had a personal history of any non-melanoma cancer or had a cog- Aggarwal et al Am J Health Behav. 2007;31(Suppl 1):S57-S68 S59nitive impairment that affected mental status. Study Measures Numeracy was assessed with 3 crite- ria adapted from Black and colleaguesand scored as a dichotomous outcome (numerate: yes/no). 21 Subjects were con- sidered numerate if they met 3 criteria:(1) basic familiarity with probability, (2) comfort with using probability, and (3) basic familiarity with proportions. Thefirst criterion was assessed by a response to the following question: \"Imagine that you flip a coin 1000 times. Out of 1000flips, how many times do you think the coin comes up heads?\" The correct re- sponse to this question was 500 times.The second criterion was assessed by posing 3 quantitative risk questions that asked the participant about her percep-tion of her chances of developing breast and colorectal cancer (_X_ in 1000). The correct response was rated as any nu-merical response to all 3 questions. The third criterion was assessed by compar- ing the participant's estimates of herlifetime and 5-year risk of getting cancer. A correct response occurred when the participant accurately estimated her life-time risk to be greater than her 5-year risk. Though the specific questions used for criteria 2 and 3 differed from that usedby Black, the concepts were the same. Nonresponse to any of these questions was considered to be an incorrect re-sponse. We also analyzed each numeracy question to evaluate the contribution of each criterion on the overall numeracyclassification. Demographic information was self-re- ported and included age, race/ethnicity,medical insurance, level of education, and income. To determine race and ethnicity, subjects were first asked ifthey considered themselves to be His- panic or Latina and then given the follow- ing choices for race based on the UScensus criteria: American Indian or Alas- kan Native, Asian, black or African Ameri- can, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander,white, or Other. These questions were paired with a place-of-birth question which created 2 subgroups of non-Hispanic blackparticipants: African American or Carib- bean Black. For our analyses racial/eth- nic categories were African Americanblack, Caribbean black, Hispanic, white, and Other. Based on a series of insurancequestions, we categorized subjects as having either private insurance or nonprivate insurance (which includedpublic, Medicare, none, or other). Partici- pants were asked to report on their family history of breast and colorectal cancerand also whether or not they had a pri- mary care provider (PCP). Dichotomous outcomes of interest in the study were knowing about breast and colorectal cancer screening guidelines and being up-to-date with breast and colorectal cancer screening. Subjects were categorized as knowledgeable of can- cer screening guidelines if they correctlyanswered questions about the recom- mended age to start screening: for an average-risk woman, correct categoricalresponses were 40-49 years for breast cancer and 50-59 years for colorectal can- cer. 22,23 Subjects were considered up-to- date for breast cancer screening if they had a routine mammogram within the last 2 years. For those age 50 years andolder, up-to-date for colorectal cancer screening included having a fecal occult blood test in the past year or ever havinglower endoscopy (flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy). As most subjects were between age 50 and 60, ever having hadan endoscopy was considered up-to-date with screening. Statistical Analysis We used chi-square and Fisher-exact tests for bivariate comparisons. Logisticregression was used for multivariate analyses of the knowledge, and up-to-date withscreening. Potential confounders inves- tigated in these models included age, race, education, insurance, income, andsite of care. The models of knowledge and screening behavior also investigated the association with having a family historyof the disease and having a primary care provider (PCP). Because income, insurance, and edu- cation were collinear, we included only education among these 3 variables in the models of numeracy and knowledge ofscreening. We felt education had the stron- gest theoretical relationship with these outcomes. However, in the up-to-datemodels of cancer screening we used only insurance, as it has been shown that access is often a significant factor inpredicting health care use. 24 Six percent of surveys were completed in a non-En-Numeracy and Cancer Screening S60Table1 Study Participant Characteristics by Numeracy (N=264) Inadequate Adequate Total numeracy numeracy % % 40-49 44 76 2450-59 29 68 32 60-69 18 65 35 70+ 9 100 0 0.008 Race African American 39 80 20White 25 45 55 Black Caribbean 17 87 13 Hispanic 12 91 9Other NH a6 81 19 <0.0001 Education <High school 18 94 6 High school 24 86 14 College 1-3 years 32 65 35College 3 years 17 45 55 Missing (N=21) 9 84 16 <0.0001 Income <$20,000 29 79 21 $20,000-50,000 29 69 31>$50,000 13 36 64 Don't know/missing 29 90 10 <0.0001 Insurance Private 36 59 41 Others 64 82 18 <0.0001 Primary Care Provider Yes 78 71 29No 22 83 17 0.08 Family History of Breast Cancer Yes 15 74 26 No 70 68 26Missing 15 100 0 0.9 b Family History ofColorectal Cancer Yes 8 71 29 No 84 72 28Missing (N=20) 20 95 5 0.9 b (conitnued on next page) Aggarwal et al Am J Health Behav. 2007;31(Suppl 1):S57-S68 S61glish language, and the survey language was not found to be significantly related to numeracy or any of the primary outcomes;hence this factor was not included in multivariate models. Therefore the final variables in the model of numeracy wereage, race, and education. The models of knowledge of cancer screening included numeracy, age, race, education, PCP, andfamily history of the disease. The models of being up-to-date with cancer screening included numeracy, age, race, insurance,PCP, and family history of the disease. In the multivariate regressions, sub- jects who failed to answer the questionsabout screening knowledge were grouped with those who incorrectly answered this question, and subjects with missing in-formation about being up-to-date with screening were grouped with those who were not up-to-date. Thus all regressionsincluded data on 264 subjects, with theexception of colorectal cancer up-to-date, in which women under age 50 were ex- cluded, leaving data on 152 subjects inthe regression analysis. We performed sensitivity analysis by excluding the subjects who failed to an-swer all 3 numeracy questions. Breast and colorectal cancer screening models were also run after excluding subjectswho failed to answer the questions which determined being up-to-date. All analyses were 2-sided and were considered to be statistically significant at a P-value of less than 0.05. We used PC-SAS version 8 (Cary, NC) for our analy-sis.

Eighteen women were ineligible based on age or personal history of breast cancer, leaving264 surveys for analyses. There were 123 (47%) subjects from the 2 hospital-based practices and 141 (53%) from communityhealth centers. Only 16 surveys (6%) were completed in languages other than En- glish, and numeracy did not differ signifi-cantly between English and non-English surveys. Therefore, all subsequent analy- ses combined English and non-Englishsurveys. Table 1 illustrates the demographic, social, and health characteristics of studysubjects by numeracy status. The mean age of subjects was 55 years (SD=10.4) ranging from 40 to 84 years. Based on thedistribution, we categorized age to study its association with numeracy. Approxi- mately half of the women surveyed wereAfrican American or Caribbean black, 25% were white, 12% were Hispanic, and 6% were of other non-Hispanic minorityrace. Although 49% reported at least some college education, one third reported an annual income of less than $20,000, andonly 36% had private health insurance. The majority of the women (78%) had a primary care physician. Fifteen percenthad a first-degree relative with breast cancer and 8% with colorectal cancer. A small percentage of women consideredthemselves to be at more than average risk for developing breast (8%) or colorectal (7%) cancer. Numeracy Twenty-six percent (69/264) of partici- pants were categorized as numerate based on the correct response to all 3 criteria outlined above. Seventy-four percent ofparticipants had inadequate numeracy, and Table 2 illustrates the percent of incorrect response to each criterion foradequate numeracy status. Sixty-six per-cent (174/264) of participants to coin-flip ques- tion, 40% (105/264) were ques- tions, and 13% incorrectly esti- mated that their 5-year risk of breastcancer was greater than their lifetime risk. Among the 74% (195/264) of partici- pants who had inadequate numeracy, themajority 92% (174/195) were categorized based on their inability to answer the first coin-flip question alone. Only an addi-tional 8% (21/195) of participants were categorized as having inadequate numeracy based on an incorrect responseto the second or third criterion (not pro- viding answer to all risk-perception ques- tions 5/21, lifetime cancer 12/21,and 4/21 participants fulfilled both crite- ria. In bivariate analyses, the rate of ad- equate numeracy increased with advanc- ing age but was found to be lowest (0%) among subjects over 70 years of age (Table1). Adequate numeracy rates were also higher among subjects who were white and who reported higher income, moreyears of formal education, and private insurance. More of the subjects recruited from community health center sites thanhospital sites were innumerate (87% and 59% respectively). In adjusted analyses the odds of having adequate numeracyincreased with higher education; those with some college or technical school had increased odds of having adequatenumeracy (OR= 2.7, CI 1.04 to 7.2) when compared to subjects with less than high school education. African Americans hada lower odds of having adequate numeracy when compared to whites (OR=0.3, CI 0.1 to 0.6). Because site of care was signifi-cantly associated with race, education, income, and insurance, it was not in- cluded in any of the multivariate analy-ses.Table 2 Study Participant Response to Numeracy Criteria (N=264) Numeracy Questions Incorrect response N (%) 1.

The majority of the subjects responding incorrectly chose an age younger thanthe recommended screening: 63% chose under 40 years for mammography; 72% chose under 50 years for colorectal screen-ing. Table 3 depicts the results of our bivari- ate analyses for the knowledge outcome.Adequate numeracy was significantly associated with being knowledgeable of both breast (P=0.0003) and colorectal can-cer (P=0.003) screening guidelines. Age 50-59 years and white race were also associated with increased knowledge ofcolorectal cancer screening guidelines. In multivariate analysis (Table 4), we found that adequate numeracy was sig-nificantly associated with an increased odds (OR= 2.7, CI 1.4 to 5.4) of being knowledgeable of breast cancer screen-ing but not of colorectal cancer screening guidelines. The odds of being knowledge- able of colorectal cancer screening guide-lines, however, do increase with age (OR= 2.0, CI 1.2 to 3.4). Up-to-date With Cancer Screening Overall, our subjects reported high screening rates. Seventy-seven percent were up-to-date with mammography screening, and 49% were up-to-date with colorectal cancer screening. Table 3 also presents bivariate asso- ciations of our other primary outcome up- to-date with cancer screening. Breast cancer screening rates were highestamong women of 60-69 years (P<0.0008), higher among whites and Hispanics (P<0.01), extremes of income (P<0.006),and among those with a primary care physician (P<0.0001). No association was found between mammography screeningand adequate numeracy. We also found no association between knowledge and screening. In multivariate analysis (Table4), adequate numeracy was not a signifi- cant predictor of being up-to-date with mammography screening. Our model pre-dicted the odds of being up-to-date for breast cancer screening to be higher with age (OR= 1.8, CI 1.3 to 2.4) and amongsubjects with a primary care provider (OR= 5.1, CI 2.6 to 10.2) but lower among the ethnic category Caribbean blacks (OR=Table 4 Multivariate Analysis of Knowledge of Cancer Screening Guidelines and Up-to-date with Cancer Screening by Numeracy Status Knowledge of screening guidelines Up-to-date with cancer screening Odds Ratio (Confidence Interval) Odds Ratio (Confidence Interval) Breast Cancer aColorectal Cancer bBreast Cancer cColorectal Cancer d Numeracy Adequate 2.7 1.6 (0.8-3.5) 0.7 (0.3-1.6) 1.1 (0.5-2.7) Inadequate re ference reference reference reference a Logistic regression model predicting knowledge of breast cancer screening guidelines adjusted for numeracy, age, race, education, primary care provider, and family history of breast cancer.

When this model was tested for sensitivity to missing numeracy or out-come data (by excluding those with miss- ing answers) Caribbean black race was no longer statistically different from whiterace (OR=0.4, CI 0.1-1.8), and other re- sults remained the same. Bivariate analyses of colorectal cancer screening found higher proportions of sub- jects of age 50-59 and 60-69 years numeracy wasnot associated with being up-to-date with colorectal cancer screening. Again, we found no association between knowledgeand screening. In multivariate analysis the odds of being up-to-date were higher with age (OR= 3.0, CI 1.5 to 5.8), amongAfrican Americans (OR=3.0, CI 1.03 to 8.9) when compared to whites, and among sub- jects with private insurance (OR= 3.6, CI1.5 to 8.7). Having a primary care physi- cian and numeracy were not significantly associated with colorectal cancer screen-ing. There were no differences in model results when those subjects who failed to answer numeracy or screening questionswere excluded. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Discussion Our study is the first to explore the role of numeracy on knowledge and cancerscreening practices in a population most at risk for poor cancer outcomes. Among this urban group of women with diverseracial/ethnic backgrounds, we found that having adequate numeracy skills was associated with increased knowledge ofbreast cancer screening guidelines but not with colorectal cancer screening guidelines. We did not find an associationbetween having adequate numeracy and being up-to-date with screening practices, for either breast or colorectal cancer. It is common for physicians and other health care providers to provide informa- tion about rates, percentages, and propor-tions when discussing health informa- tion, especially when evaluating the like- lihood of developing cancer. Studies havefound that use of numeric concepts is an efficient means of discussing risk with patients. However our study exhibits astark reality about informed decision making; more than two thirds of our sub- jects were not able to answer a simpleprobability question, and 74% of the popu- lation had inadequate numeracy by ourstandards. This raises questions about how to communicate health information to patients. With such a high rate ofinadequate numeracy, clinicians need to significantly simplify how they discuss concepts such as probability. We recom-mend confirming patients' comprehen- sion for all important clinical discussions as a universal precaution against confu-sion and failed communication. 25 Previous studies in minority popula- tions suggest that women are aware ofmammography and breast cancer but lack specific knowledge about screening guide- lines. 26 A study of low-education, low-in- come Latina women found that 38-45% were aware of recommendations for mam- mography frequency.27 Similarly, we found only 32% of women in our study were knowledgeable of breast cancer screen- ing guidelines and 25% of colorectal can-cer screening guidelines. Previous stud- ies have found that lack of knowledge about cancer screening was associatedwith poor screening behavior. 26,27,29 Our study findings did not support this argu- ment. On the contrary, our populationreported high screening rates. Studies have shown associations be- tween low rates of cancer screening, lowereducational attainment, and suboptimal health care access with low socioeco- nomic status. 30-38 Seventy-seven percent of our subjects had mammography screen- ing within the last 2 years, and 49% had colorectal cancer screening\u2014higher thanthe national averages of 70% and 37% respectively. We found different predic- tors for breast and colorectal cancerscreening in our population. Although having a primary care provider was the strongest predictor for breast cancerscreening, having private insurance was the strongest predictor of colorectal can- cer screening. These findings support arecent study on mammography decision making which found that free mammograms were not sufficient incen-tive for never-screened minorities un- less also accompanied by a recommenda- tion from a provider or cancer organiza-tion. 39 Provider recommendation has also been shown to be an important predictor for colorectal screening in other studies2 though our findings did not support this finding. These findings may reflect state- funded initiatives. For example, numer-ous public health programs target breast cancer screening in the Boston area,Numeracy and Cancer Screening S66including the availability of mammogra- phy services free of charge for income- eligible Massachusetts State residents,which may explain why sociodemographic characteristics do not drive screening in this setting. 40 In this respect, our cohort is similar to veterans, who have access to comprehensive preventive health care coverage and have been found to havehigher screening rates than nonveteran populations. 41Similar programs for colorectal cancer screening do not cur-rently exist in Massachusetts, therefore shifting the predictors of screening to more traditional access-driven barrierssuch as insurance status. Although the literature is rich with studies exhibiting racial disparity in can-cer screening rates, our results did not show any racial or ethnic disparities in the population surveyed. 3,4,6,8-11,42 Again, this may be because our population had fewer barriers to access for care; 85% of the subjects had a primary care physician,and 95% had some kind of insurance, though 45% had only public forms of in- surance. This is supported by the findingsof Dolan and colleagues, who showed that in the context of equal access to care and similar insurance statuses, AfricanAmerican veterans were more likely to receive colorectal cancer screening than white veterans were. 41 Our study further supports the hypothesis that having both increased access to care and a regular primary care physician plays a signifi-cant role in cancer prevention and regu- lar screening. Our study results are limited to an ethnically diverse urban population with high screening rates and may not be easily generalized to other medical set-tings. Moreover, by the nature of the study design, the majority of participants have a primary care provider, one of thestrongest predictors of compliance with cancer screening. Knowledge of cancer screening recommendations was similarto that of other ethnically diverse urban populations. 27 We were unable to verify the self-reported mammogram andcolorectal cancer screening among these women; however, the literature supports high accuracy in self reported data: ifasked within 2 years of the screening test, 75% accuracy among those report- ing breast cancer screening and 85%accuracy for reported colorectal screen- ing. 43-45 We also acknowledge limitationsin our measurements that may be attrib- utable to the fact that this survey was designed primarily to measure risk per-ception. We utilized awareness of recom- mended age to begin cancer screening as a proxy for knowledge as this was the onlyknowledge question included in the study. Though controversy regarding age to be- gin breast cancer screening does exist,most organizations recommend starting baseline screening at age 40 or higher. 46 Numeracy was assessed utilizing an ad- aptation of 3 criteria from prior work by Black and colleagues.21 This measure- ment was chosen specifically based on itsprevious use in the evaluation of cancer risk perception. Although our numeracy measurement has not been validated,the demographic associations exhibited in our numeracy analyses do conform to those found on the NAALS with respectsto age, race/ethnicity, and education. 19 ConclusionThis study illustrates that in a multi- ethnic urban population, adequate numeracy and knowledge of screeningguidelines are less important than ac- cess to care and physician recommenda- tion in achieving high cancer screeningrates. It does not undermine the fact that studies in the past have shown numeracy to be an important tool for health caredelivery and improving outcomes in other chronic medical problems like diabetes and hypertension. Nonetheless, the verylow rate of adequate numeracy seen in this cohort, even in patients with a high level of educational attainment, shouldprompt physicians to be conscious of their patients' understanding and interpreta- tion of their recommendations.

CONTEXT: Although office-based opioid treatment with buprenorphine (OBOT-B) has been successfully imple- mented in primary care settings in the US, its use hasnot been reported in homeless patients. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the feasibility of OBOT-B in homeless relative to housed patients. DESIGN: A retrospective record review examining treat- ment failure, drug use, utilization of substance abuse treatment services, and intensity of clinical support by a nurse care manager (NCM) among homeless andhoused patients in an OBOT-B program between Au- gust 2003 and October 2004. Treatment failure was defined as elopement before completing medicationinduction, discharge after medication induction due toongoing drug use with concurrent nonadherence with intensified treatment, or discharge due to disruptive behavior. RESULTS: Of 44 homeless and 41 housed patients enrolled over 12 months, homeless patients were more likely to be older, nonwhite, unemployed, infected withHIV and hepatitis C, and report a psychiatric illness.Homeless patients had fewer social supports and more chronic substance abuse histories with a 3- to 6-fold greater number of years of drug use, number ofdetoxification attempts and percentage with a history of methadone maintenance treatment. The proportion of subjects with treatment failure for the homeless(21%) and housed (22%) did not differ ( P=.94). At 12 months, both groups had similar proportions with illicit opioid use [Odds ratio (OR), 0.9 (95% CI, 0.5 -1.7) P=.8], utilization of counseling (homeless, 46%; housed, 49%; P=.95), participation in mutual-help groups (homeless, 25%; housed, 29%; P=.96). At 12 months, 36% of the homeless group was no longer homeless.During the first month of treatment, homeless patients required more clinical support from the NCM than housed patients.CONCLUSIONS: Despite homeless opioid dependent patients 'social instability, greater comorbidities, and more chronic drug use, office-based opioid treatmentwith buprenorphine was effectively implemented in this population comparable to outcomes in housed patients with respect to treatment failure, illicit opioid use, andutilization of substance abuse treatment.

DOI: 10.1007/s11606-006-0023-1\u00a9 of General Internal Medicine 2007;22:171 -176 INTRODUCTION Opioid abuse persists as a pervasive public health problem in the United States, both heroin1and prescription opioid analgesics.1,2Opioid agonist treatment with methadone or buprenorphine is effective treating opioid dependence.3-12 With the advent of sublingual buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence, primary care physicians in the United States gained the opportunity to effectively treat opioid-dependent patients in primary medical care settings, common- ly referred to as office-based opioid treatment (OBOT). 13,14 In 2003, the primary care clinic at Boston Medical Center (BMC) implemented an OBOT with buprenorphine (OBOT-B)program employing collaborative care between physicians and a nurse care manager (NCM). 15All patients in the BMC pri- mary care clinic OBOT-B program were required to have stablehousing, as clinical guidelines recommend a stable social environment as an entry criterion for OBOT-B. 16,17Using social stability as a criterion for OBOT-B precludes homeless persons,a population with a high prevalence of addiction, 18-21leading to a high risk of illness and death.22-25 Unique challenges confront homeless individuals engaging in substance abuse treatment,26which likely contribute to their high rates of treatment failure.27,28Characteristics of homeless persons are correlated with relapse: lack of social support; unstable living environment; and longer duration ofdrug dependence. 29,30However, research has shown that homeless persons 'success in substance abuse treatment can increase under supportive circumstances.30,31Furthermore, despite limited literature on methadone treatment in homeless populations, published data suggest greater success withReceived January 24, 2006 Revised July 17, 2006Accepted September 27, 2006Published online January 17, 2007 171enhanced access to32and unconventional methods of treat- ment (e.g., medical care provision in homeless health care settings).33Although homeless opioid dependent individuals may benefit from buprenorphine treatment, clinical guidelines have excluded them. This retrospective cohort study characterizes the feasibility of office-based opioid treatment with buprenorphine (OBOT-B) in a homeless population. We describe a customized model of OBOT- B care and outcomes in homeless compared to housed patients. METHODS Program Description Model of Care. In August 2003, OBOT-B was implemented in an urban academic medical center for homeless patients in a homeless clinic and for housed patients in a primary careclinic. Both patient groups were treated with collaborative care between qualified primary care physicians (PCPs) and a single nurse care manager (NCM). All patients were referred by theirrespective clinics and were to receive maintenance buprenor-phine treatment for at least 12 months. Homelessness was defined as spending 1 or more weeks on the street or in a shelter within the previous 3 months. Upon referral by the PCP, homelessand housed patients were admitted successively or placed on a wait list when the practice was at capacity due to the federally mandated 30-patient-per-practice limit at the time of the study.Our model of care included 4 stages of treatment: (1) Determina- tion of eligibility; (2) Medication induction; (3) Medication stabi- lization; (4) Treatment maintenance. Determination of Eligibility. Assessment protocols were similar for homeless and housed groups. OBOT-B, a less structured treatment option compared t o methadone maintenance treatment, required a patient assessment for appropriateness.OBOT-B appropriateness was determined by adherence with assessment appointments, mental health stability [i.e., ability to comprehend and consent to OBOT-B protocols, chronicmental illness with ongoing psychiatric care and no acute mental health issues (e.g., suicidal ideation)], absence of painful conditions requiring opioid analgesics, absence of medical contraindications (e.g., pregnancy or liver function tests greater than five times the normal level), and absence of alcohol or other drug co-dependence. Patients with sporadicalcohol or other drug use remained eligible. Patients onmethadone maintenance doses greater than 30 mg per day were excluded based on current practice guidelines. 16If deemed appropriate for OBOT-B, patients received a comprehensiveassessment by the NCM that included a detailed medical, psychiatric, and substance abuse history including documen- tation of DSM-IV diagnosis of opioid dependence. Social historyincluded employment and homelessness status. Admission lab work included a complete blood count, electrolytes, renal and liver function tests, hepatitis A, B, and C serologies, and urinetoxicology for opioids (including oxycodone for abuse), cocaine, benzodiazepines, barbi- turates, and amphetamines. All patients were tested for tuber- culosis exposure and were offered HIV testing and counseling.Treatment consents and individualized treatment plans were reviewed and signed by both patient and NCM. At a separate appointment, PCPs reviewed the NCM assessment and treat-ment plan, performed a complete physical examination, and wrote the initial buprenorphine prescription. Patients were strongly encouraged to utilize other substance abuse services,including addiction counseling and mutual-help groups [e.g., Narcotics Anonymous (NA)]. Medication Induction. Induction, occurring during the first 3 days of treatment, differed for homeless and housed patients.Homeless patients received \"office induction, \"with up to 8 hours observation on day 1 by the NCM for the following: signs of opioid withdrawal, dose administration, and responseto medication. Homeless patients left the office with a night- time dosing protocol to be used if withdrawal recurred and then returned daily for the next 2 days for dose adjustments.In contrast, because all housed patients were reachable by telephone, they received \"home induction \"by following a 3-day dosing protocol at home. The 3-day protocol gave specificdosing schedules with a maximum daily dose for each day (i.e., max dose, 8, 16, and 24 mg for days 1, 2, and 3, respectively). The NCM called all housed patients at home before the firstbuprenorphine dose was taken and then at least daily duringthe 3-day induction. The NCM was available during business hours for drop-in visits and 24 hours a day via cell phone. Medication Stabilization. Stabilization, occurring during days 4 through 14 of treatment, differed for homeless and housed patients. Homeless patients presented to the clinic daily, except weekends, for observed dosing and assessment whilehoused patients were seen twice per week but had at least daily NCM phone contact. Treatment Maintenance. Ongoing monitoring for drug use and treatment adherence, occurring beyond day 14 of treatment,was based on individual patient needs in both groups. Bupre- norphine prescriptions were provided in 1 to 4 week amounts determined by the patient 's ability to safely secure medica- tions. For example, 1-week amounts for patients without a secure storage place and 2 -4 week amounts for patients with a secure storage place. Patients were seen at least monthly bythe NCM and at least every 6 months by the PCP. Patients were expected to respond to unscheduled \"call-backs \"to the clinic for urine toxicology, observed dosing, pill counts, and revisionsof treatment plans as needed. The need for \"call-backs \"was based on the NCM or PCP 's clinical suspicion that the patient may have relapsed or may be diverting their medication based on abnormal urine toxicology, reports of lost pills, requests forearly refills, or missed appointments. Urine was tested for opioids (including oxycodone for patients with a history of oxycodone abuse) and other drugs (including cocaine, benzo-diazepines, barbiturates, and amphetamines) as well as bupre- norphine at least every 3 months. Intensified treatment (i.e., substance abuse counseling) was required for patients withongoing use of opioids, other drugs, or alcohol. Patient Characteristics Upon entry into OBOT-B, patients 'demographics, employ- ment, homelessness status, involvement of socially supportive individuals, opioid, other drug and alcohol use, and substance abuse, medical and psychiatric histories were recorded.172 Alford et al.: Treating Homeless Patients with Buprenorphine JGIMOutcome Assessments Time to Treatment Failure. Our primary outcome was time to \"treatment failure \"defined as any of the following: elopement before completing medication induction (elopement did notoccur after induction); discharge after medication induction due to ongoing use of opioids, other drugs or alcohol with concurrent nonadherence with intensified substance abusetreatment; or discharge due to disruptive behavior (e.g.,threatening staff, theft of clinic property). Secondary outcomes included reasons for leaving the OBOT-B program (including treatment failure and successfulprogram departures), illicit op ioid and other drug use, number of NCM contacts, utilization of recommended care and social indicators (e.g., homelessness and employment status). Reasons for Leaving the OBOT-B Program. All patients who left the program before 12 months were categorized into one of the following 2 groups: \"treatment failure \"(defined above); or \"successful program departure. \"Patients classified as \"successful program departure \"left the program because they relocated and were transferred to another OBOT program, they needed a more structured treatment settingand were transferred to a methadone maintenance program, or they were fully adherent with treatment for at least 4 months and were approved for a medication taper by both the NCMand PCP. Illicit Drug Use. Both planned and \"call-back \"urine toxicology were conducted at least once every 3 months. In eachassessment window (i.e., at entry, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment), the test that was closest, yet prior, to the timepoint was reported, in an attempt to obtain a measure of abstinencethat was not biased by the number of urine toxicology tests performed. Urine toxicology tests were mostly unsupervised but measures were taken to try to minimize falsified tests (e.g.,testing for buprenorphine metabolites, urine temperature, and creatinine concentration). Urine collections were supervised when the NCM suspected falsified tests due to the followingcircumstances: patient had a recent history of abnormal urinetests; specimens were cold or diluted; patient demonstrated aberrant behavior (e.g., missed clinic appointments, requested early medication refill). The following 3 outcomes weredetermined by record review: number of NCM contacts (phone calls and clinic visits during each month of treatment); utilization of recommended care (involvement in substance abuse counseling and/or mutual-help groups defined by at least weekly attendance for 1 or more months before record review); and social indicators [homelessness, employment status (self-reported employment for at least 1 month) and presence of social supports (family member or friend actively involved in the patient 's substance abuse rehabilitative progress and in contact with the NCM within the previous 3 months)]. For all patients who left the OBOT-B program (treatment failure and successful program departure), follow-up data post-departure were not collected. Analysis Descriptive statistics (e.g., means and proportions) were usedto characterize homeless and housed groups. Exploratory,hypothesis-generating tests were then performed to compareprocess and outcome measures between groups. Chi-square or Fisher 's exact tests were used to compare dichotomous out- comes and t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare continuous outcomes between groups. NCM contacts were described for each group using the mean number of contacts per patient for each month of follow-up. Poissonregression models were constructed to estimate the rate ratio of NCM contacts in the homeless relative to housed groups. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) regression modelswere used to examine the association between homelessness status and drug use. Data collected from entry, 3, 6, 9, and 12- month timepoints were analyzed. The proportions of treatmentfailures were estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and compared between groups using the log-rank test. Successful program departures were censored at their date of departure, as follow-up data were not available beyond that date.Reported P-values are two-tailed, and a P-value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were r u nu s i n gS A Ss t a t i s t i c a ls o f t w a r e . 34This research was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Boston Univer- sity Medical Center. RESULTS Patient Characteristics During the 12 months examined, 44 homeless and 41 housed patients were enrolled. The homeless group had fewer males, fewer whites, were older, and less employed compared to theTable 1.

There was a dramatic difference in social supports, essentially nonexistent for the homeless patients but present for almost all housed patients. Similarly, comor-bidities were clearly different in the homeless versus the housed group with 95% reporting psychiatric illness versus 54%, 30% HIV-infected versus 5%, and 95% hepatitis Cinfected versus 44%, respectively. At time of study entry, 84%of the homeless patients were dependent on heroin with none dependent on oxycodone versus 63% heroin dependent and 27% oxycodone dependent in the housed patients. Theremaining 16% of the homeless and 10% of housed patients were transferred from methadone maintenance treatment. Homeless patients also had more chronic substance abuse histories with a 3- to 6-fold greater number of years of drug00.20.40.60.81 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 Duration of Treatment (days)Proportion of Patients Who Did Not Fail in OBOT-BHomeless Housed Figure 1 .

Patient Outcomes The estimated proportion of subjects with treatment failure was 21% for the homeless and 22% for the housed. Homeless and housed patients did not differ in their risk for treatmentfailure during follow-up ( P=.94) (Fig. 1). Mean duration of OBOT-B retention was 9 months for both homeless and housed groups. The percentage of patients remaining in OBOT-B (i.e., had not failed, transferred ortapered) at the 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month timepoints was 77%, 73%, 70%, and 93%, 80%, 68%, and 61% in the housed group. The number of patientswho left treatment and the reasons for leaving treatment before 12-months, including the treatment failure and successful program departure groups, appeared similar for both groups(Table 2). Of the patients remaining in treatment at 3 months, urine samples were positive for illicit opioids in 11% of homeless and20% of housed patients and at 12 months positive in only 4%in both groups. At entry, urines were positive for \"other drugs \" in 34% of homeless and 32% of housed patients and of those remaining in treatment at 12 months, positive in only 8% inboth groups. Over the 12-month period, no significant asso- ciations were found between homelessness status and use of opioids [Odds ratio (OR) 0.9 (95% CI, 0.5 -1.7); P=.8] other drugs [OR 1.7 CI, P=.2). The mean number of NCM co ntacts per patient was estimated by homelessness status for each month of follow-up (Fig. 2). During the first month of treatment (induction and stabilization), the rate of NCM contacts per patient in the homeless group was 1.7 times that in the housed group (95% CI=1.48 -1.95; P<.0001). At 12 months, 46% of homeless and 49% of housed patients reported at least weekly receipt of substance abuse counseling and 25% of homeless and 29% of housed patients reported at least weekly mutual-help groupattendance (Table 3). At 12 months, of the 44 homeless patients originally enrolled, 16 (36%) no longer met the criteria for homelessness. Employment increased for both homelessand housed patients that remained in the program for 12 months. DISCUSSION Office-based opioid treatment with buprenorphine (OBOT-B) was effectively implemented in homeless patients with out- comes comparable to housed patients. When compared to housed patients, homeless patients appeared to have a similarproportion of treatment successes (i.e., retention in treatment, successful program departure, decreased drug use, and utilization of counseling and mutual help groups), despitehaving more chronic substance abuse histories (e.g., greaternumber of years of drug use, detoxification attempts, and history of methadone maintenance treatment), more medical and psychiatric comorbidities, and less social support. Em-ployment and housing increased substantially among home- less patients. Homeless patients required more clinical support by the Nurse Care Manager (NCM) than housedpatients during the first month of treatment. However, not- withstanding the increased support required, feasibility of OBOT-B care to homeless patients was demonstrated andoutcomes appeared comparable to a housed group. These findings conflict with previous reports of poorer addiction treatment outcomes in homeless populations, 27,28,32 but are consistent with studies in which homeless-specific interventions improved addiction outcomes. Milby et al. ran- domized 176 homeless substance abusers to either usual orenhanced care. Enhanced care entailed daily psychoeduca-tional groups and weekly individual counseling, plus absti- nence-contingent employme nt and housing starting at month 4 of treatment. Subjects receiving enhanced care hadsignificantly lower rates of alcohol and drug use during the 12 months of follow-up. 31Kertesz et al. found an association between post-detoxification stabilization programs and time tosubstance use post-discharge from a residential detoxification program for homeless persons with addictions. 30 This study provides further evidence that addiction treat- ment in homeless populations can yield effective results. It suggests that more than the usual resources, such as availability of a NCM, may be required for this populationwhen pursuing substance abuse treatment. The availability of a NCM also allowed us to implement a home-based medication induction protocol, which is not currently recommended by national guidelines, through dailyphone contact between the NCM and housed patients. Several limitations to this study should be considered. While data were collected prospectively during clinical careusing a carefully designed medical record, the study was retrospective. In addition, follow-up data were not available once patients departed the program. However, of patients wholeft the program earlier than 12 months, the reasons forleaving (i.e., treatment failure vs successful program depar- ture) appeared similar between homeless and housed groups. To assess the value of an OBOT-B program in homelesspersons, one ideally would compare outcomes with homeless persons requesting substance abuse treatment who did not get access to buprenorphine. However, this study was notintended to retest the efficacy of buprenorphine treatment, but rather, evaluate the feasibility of delivering this known effective treatment in a homeless population. Thus, thecomparison group in this study was non-homeless persons receiving buprenorphine. An experienced, skilled NCM played an essential role in caring for patients in the programsdescribed. Generalizability of such a model may depend onskills of such a key individual. Generalizability may also depend on the level of collaboration among practitioners within the microsystem in which the care is delivered. 35The provider collaboration component of the OBOT-B program was not explicitly measured in this study. Finally, although the total number of patients in this study is small, a consequence of thefederal law limiting the number of patients receiving bupre- norphine in a single clinical practice, the findings are robust and statistically significant. In conclusion, office-based opioid treatment with buprenor- phine (OBOT-B) can be effective in homeless patients. In this study, despite homeless patients 'greater comorbidities, less social support, and more chronic substance use histories,their outcomes in terms of treatment failure and illicit drug use were comparable to housed patients. Social benefits, specifi- cally gaining access to housing and employment, occurred in a175 Alford et al.: Treating Homeless Patients with Buprenorphine JGIMsurprisingly high percentage of the homeless OBOT-B patients. Beyond individual clinical benefit, potentially unmeasured public health benefits regarding risk behaviors and healthcare utilization need to be further assessed. Using appropriate models of care, buprenorphine treatment for opioid depen- dence among homeless persons should be implemented.

Three expert clinicians shared their thoughts about the patient's assessment and management. CASE DESCRIPTION Monday You received a frantic phone call from a nurse col\u00ad league because her 26-year-old daughter, Susan, was addicted to heroin and relapsed immediately after being discharged from a 5-day inpatient detoxification program. Susan was eager to try treatment with buprenorphine but was unable to find a physician accepting new patients. You arranged for Susan to see you in your office the following day. Tuesday Susan's opioid abuse started in high school when she was 17 years old with weekend use ofoxycodone. After a few months, she began using daily when she realized that on days without oxycodone she would become sick. After 1 year, she switched to intranasal heroin because it was much cheaper and more readily available. Within 6 months, she and her c.losest friend began injecting heroin. Her longest drug-free time was 2 months, approximately 3 years ago, when she moved to live with her father. She attributed her sobriety to being away from her drug-using friends. After a fight with her father, she moved back to live with her mother.

Although she shared needles in the past, she was currently enrolled in a needle exchange program. Within the past 2 years, she had completed 8 detoxification programs and always relapsed within 1 to 2 days after discharge. She stopped attending Narcotics Anonymous (NA) meetings be\u00ad cause hearing other's \"war stories\" was not helpful. She had considered methadone maintenance treatment but was wor\u00ad ried that methadone \"eats your bones and teeth, and makes you fat.\" She also feared that her work hours as a hotel clerk would conflict with the dosing hours of methadone clinics. Moreover, her mother was \"antimethadone\" as a result of seeing methadone patients loitering around the hospital \"sell\u00ad ing drugs and nodding off.\" Susan had tried snorting cocaine many years ago but did not like the way she felt. She had taken Klonopin, obtained from friends, in the past to help with \"a~iety\" and trouble sleeping. She smoked cigarettes and denied other drug or alcohol use. She had no primary health care and had not seen a psychiatrist. Susan dropped out of community college after one se~ester and had held various clerical jobs. She was living WIth her mother and had a boyfriend who was in recovery from alcoholism and who attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) daily. Susan's physical examination was normal except for track marks on both arms. Her laboratory tests were positive for hepatitis B exposure and immunity and chronically active hepatitis C (genotype 1) with normal liver function tests. She was negative for HIV infection. Susan was not interested in hepatitis C treatment because she felt fine and knew friends who got sick while taking interferon. Her urine toxicology was positive for opiates and benzodiazepines. She had last used heroin and Klonopin the previous night. . You spend 20 minutes educating Susan about buprenor\u00ad phine treatment, the need for concurrent psychosocial treat\u00ad ment (counseling and/or 12-step meetings), and the impor\u00ad tance of avoiding illicit benzodiazepines. Susan left your office with a prescription for a 3-day supply of Suboxone (buprenorphine/naloxone) and was instructed to return the following day with all her tablets and in mild-to-moderate opioid withdrawal. She agreed to reconnect with her previous addiction counselor. Wednesday Susan returned at 8 AM feeling \"dope sick\" and was extremely anxious. She last used heroin 12 hours ago and was yawning, had runny nose and eyes, and dilated pupils. She JAddict Med Volume 1, Number 2, June 2007 73 Alford et al JAddict Med Volume 1, Number 2, June 2007 took her first dose of 4 mg sublingual of Suboxone and felt better within 30 minutes. After 2 hours of observation, she felt fine and was instructed to take an additional 4 mg later in the day if needed. She was given a daily dosing schedule for the next 2 days and told to return on Friday. Friday Susan returned stating that she felt \"great and com\u00ad pletely normal\" while taking 16 mg. For the first time in 2 years she was no longer thinking about using drugs. She agreed to continue taking 16 mg daily, to make an appoint\u00ad ment with her previous addiction counselor, and to start attending NA meetings. Next Few Weeks You saw Susan twice and she continued to do well. She denied withdrawal symptoms or drug craving, and she said that she had hung up on her drug dealer. She had changed her phone number to stop her drug-using friends from calling her. She was thinking about going back to school the next semes\u00ad ter. Susan's mother called to thank you for \"saving\" her daughter's life. Susan had not called her addiction counselor and had not started attending l Z-step meetings but promised to do so before her next appointment. She repeatedly ex\u00ad claimed that Suboxone was a \"miracle drug.\" She offered to speak at physician trainings if it would increase the number of doctors offering buprenorphine treatment. Next Few Months Susan continued to remain compliant with her nursing and medical appointments and maintained abstinence from illicit drugs as confirmed by negative urine drug tests; how\u00ad ever, she had not started going to counseling or 12-step meetings. During the second month, Susan arrived 1 hour late for her appointment and complained of increased insomnia, headaches, and anxiety. She had spoken to her former addic\u00ad tion counselor who attributed her symptoms to the naloxone in Suboxone and suggested she ask for Subutex, the \"bu\u00ad prenorphine-only\" tablet. Her counselor emphasized the im\u00ad portance of \"getting off' buprenorphine as soon as possible because it was only a \"temporary crutch\" that she should not need. Susan also requested an increase in her dose to 24 mg to help her sleep at night. Her urine was positive for opiates and benzodiazepines and negative for buprenorphine. She had stopped her Suboxone for a few days to party \"one last time\" with friends. She felt guilty about her \"slip\" and was now \"back on track.\" She easily restarted Suboxone on her own. She was still not attending l2-step meetings because \"they are against buprenorphine.\" She had broken up with her boyfriend after he relapsed and was actively drinking. You recommended continuing Suboxone 16 mg, emphasized the importance of attending addiction counseling with someone familiar with buprenorphine treatment, and required a psy\u00ad chiatric evaluation of her anxiety symptoms. The following day Susan's mother called because she was concerned that Susan was starting to associate with her drug-using friends and wanted to know the results of her drug tests. DISCUSSION Edwin Salsitz, MD This case represents a common clinical presentation of the disease of opioid addiction. Her initial illicit opioid exposure occurred at age 17 years with the prescription opioid, oxycodone. Unfortunately there has been a dramatic rise in prescription opioid abuse among teenagers. The drugs are obtained from medicine cabinets, friends, dealers, and often the Internet. After taking oxycodone for a few months, she developed physical dependence, switched to heroin in\u00ad tranasal, and then intravenous use. The intravenous use ex\u00ad posed her to Hepatitis B and C, but not HIV. We are not given information about Susan's life expe\u00ad riences before age 17 years. A life narrative is helpful to assess individual vulnerability to addiction. A genetic predis\u00ad position to addiction is common and is considered to account for 50% of the vulnerability. Especially in women, sexual trauma as an environmental risk factor is common. In some studies of addicted women, up to 80% report a history of sexual trauma/violence. Of those, a significant number de\u00ad velop posttraumatic stress and anxiety disorder. Susan seems to have an anxiety disorder, which had not been formally addressed. In addition, patients with a history of anxiety or depression are more likely to be placed on prescription opioids.' It may not be possible to obtain such sensitive, traumatic history on day 1, but on follow-up visits these issues should be explored. She had a 2-month period of abstinence from opioids. I would ask her how she felt without opioids: Was she anx\u00ad ious? Did she function well? The answers to these questions may provide important clues as to the need for, and benefit from, opioid agonist therapy. Like many patients, with opioid addiction, Susan has had multiple episodes of withdrawal treatment (detoxifica\u00ad tion). Unfortunately, as has been often documented, relapse is the rule, rather than the exception.? She was an excellent candidate for office-based opioid therapy- had family sup\u00ad port, had a job, and was motivated. Her logistic concerns about attending a methadone clinic are reasonable. Persistent myths about methadone destroying teeth and bones unfortu\u00ad nately confuse many potential patients. The stigma surround\u00ad ing methadone treatment is tragic, but real. However, Susan was a good candidate for sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone in an office-based setting. The buprenorphine induction and early stabilization followed published recommendations- and went smoothly. Importantly she changed some of her behaviors (hung up telephone on drug dealer, changed friends, making plans to get back to school). Opioid agonist therapy, when successful, enables a patient to rehabilitate their lives. She found the drug to be a \"miracle\" but was reluctant to access psychosocial treatment. Many patients think that the medication alone can \"cure\" their problems; however, it is well documented that medication in conjunction with psychosocial therapy pro\u00ad duces the best outcomes.' Patients with opioid addiction may have social phobia, making participation in mutual help groups difficult. Some mutual help groups are opposed to medication-assisted treatment; however, buprenorphine \u00a9 2007 American Society ofAddiction Medicine 74 JAddict Med Volume 1, Number 2, June 2007 Buprenorphine Treatment anonymous groups have developed, which will fill a treat\u00ad ment gap. Some patients prefer and do well with individual psychotherapy. Unfortunately, but not uncommonly, Susan's addiction counselor emphasized the importance of \"getting\" off the buprenorphine rapidly and used the term \"crutch\" in referring to buprenorphine treatment. Although these are widely held beliefs, there is no scientific support for their validity. The evidence clearly shows that the longer a patient remains on opioid agonist therapy, the better they do in all parameters of their lives. Neuroimaging studies show normalization and stabilization of key neurobiological functions in those pa\u00ad tients who remain on opioid agonist therapy.\" Therefore, it was predictable that when Susan stopped taking buprenor\u00ad phine, she relapsed. Because addiction, like all chronic dis\u00ad eases, is a relapsing, progressive, remitting, incurable disor\u00ad der, this should not be surprising nor viewed as a reason to stop treatment. It usually takes some time to achieve remis\u00ad sion. The current recommendation is to use Suboxone, ex\u00ad cept in pregnancy. At times there is an indication to switch from Suboxone to Subutex. Patients who develop headaches, cannot tolerate the taste of Suboxone, experience nausea after Suboxone, or develop a rash can be considered for a switch to Subutex. Ideally these patients would be stable with low risk for diversion or misuse of the Subutex. In Susan's case, switching to Subutex was not indicated, because she had stopped taking Suboxone and relapsed. She has acquired chronic hepatitis C infection, most likely from injection drug use. Most injection drug users who share needles become infected with hepatitis C. Needle ex\u00ad change programs have proven to be effective in reducing transmission of infectious diseases, without increasing rates of injection drug use.\" Because her liver enzymes are normal, she will most likely have minimal disease on her liver biopsy. Genotype I is the genotype with the lowest response rate to currently available treatment with interferon and ribavirin (50% chance of sustained viral response). Because treatment has significant side effects, it is probably prudent to delay treatment for now while Susan deals with consolidating her stability with the addictive disease. Although Susan's mother is your colleague, and a health care provider, unless you have gotten specific written consent to discuss Susan's case with her, you are prohibited from doing so. These are issues that should be discussed and clarified early in treatment. For example, you will want to have an ongoing discussion with her psychiatrist and coun\u00ad selor. You must obtain permission for each individual with whom you will communicate. These rules are governed under CFR 42. In summary, Susan represents a typical patient with the disease of opioid addiction. Preaddiction history may provide clues about her vulnerability to opioid addiction. Abstinence\u00ad based therapies were not effective, and she claimed that she felt \"normal\" while taking buprenorphine. She is an excellent candidate for buprenorphine maintenance treatment, along with effective psychosocial treatment. The buprenorphine treatment may be efficacious for her anxiety. She should use \u00a9 2007 American Society ofAddiction Medicine the stability provided by the buprenorphine to further her education, vocational status, underlying psychologic issues, and personal life. There should be no rush or goal to discon\u00ad tinue buprenorphine maintenance. Judith Martin, MD This is not an uncommon presentation for young adult patients. Distressed parents or relatives call, and they often bring (sometimes drag) the patient to the doctor's office. In such cases, the initial visit often will take a long time, because there will be more than one person present who will want time with you. This is an unusually flexible scheduling feat; many places would not have such a next-day appointment available. This addiction history has many familiar features. Although the patient is young, she has used daily for 9 years. If relapse to drug use is used as the measure of success or failure, there have already been many \"failed\" detoxification attempts. It may be helpful to review these repeated relapses with Susan to gain some therapeutically useful clues. Does she see these treatment episodes as personal failures or as a deficiency in the medical system? And to come up with a treatment plan for Susan, we need to hear more about what she wants to achieve in treatment. Is it relief of withdrawal and craving? Does she aspire to more career development or degrees? Does she want to marry her boyfriend and have children? Maybe she just wants to get her mother off her back. What does she feel she has accomplished so far? The history of escalation of risk from oral ingestion of prescription opioids to intranasal heroin and eventually to injected heroin is common, especially in cities where heroin is cheap and plentiful. Susan's history of repeated relapse after inpatient care might be a relative contraindication to office-based treatment with buprenorphine, but it is worth a try if such care has never included maintenance pharmaco\u00ad therapy. The daily medication might stabilize her opioid use to the point that she can sustain ongoing engagement in treatment, and outpatient counseling and office visits could be successful. Psychiatric co-occurring disorders may contribute to relapse. When addicted patients present psychiatric symp\u00ad toms it may be difficult to distinguish the primary condition. Anxiety in the context of repeated opioid withdrawal epi\u00ad sodes is difficult to distinguish from craving or opioid deficit. The history does not clarify details about the anxiety or whether there is a family history of addiction or psychiatric problems. The approach of treating the withdrawal and crav\u00ad ing for opioids first and re-evaluating the anxiety if still present later seems reasonable and in this case seemed to support a withdrawal-mediated source for her anxiety. The patient's well-being, which resulted during and after induc\u00ad tion to sublingual buprenorphine, suggests that the anxiety was opioid withdrawal. Patients often find it hard to believe that their cravings are controlled with medication that does not alter their consciousness. It is not unusual to hear the word \"miracle\" in medication-assisted treatment. However, patients often focus on drug use alone and remain under\u00ad aware of life changes that are needed to maintain the gains that they have made in treatment. Susan had begun by changing some of her social life, and she said that she was 75 Alford et al JAddict Med Volume 1, Number 2, June 2007 making plans to integrate ongoing recovery support into her life. Some of the details of the case suggest that the coun\u00ad selor does not understand medication-assisted treatment and may have been undermining Susan's gains, calling it a \"crutch.\" It may be useful to have regular contact between physician and counselor to discuss Susan's progress and to be sure the treatment plan reflects Susan's purpose. Although there is no requirement for counselor training in office-based buprenorphine treatment, there is a CSAT online course available at http://www.danyalearningcenter.org/coursepro\u00ad file.asp?cid=7.7 It is not clear whether the boyfriend, described as a recovering and then relapsed alcoholic, is a support for Susan's recovery. Being \"recovery savvy\" may help, but on the other hand there could be some judgment against the use of medications. It may benefit both ofthem to meet with the physician together to explain how opioid pharmacotherapy works. Use of syringe and needle exchange may have pro\u00ad tected her against HIV but not against hepatitis C. Because of the high concentration ofvirus in the bloodstream, hepatitis C prevention includes not sharing cookers, rinse water, cotton, in addition to not sharing the needle and syringe. Anecdotal reports suggest that nasal mucosal cuts or tears from shared straws used to inhale drugs also may transmit hepatitis C. The fact that her liver enzymes are normal does not reveal the stage of this illness. There is a lot of information with which Susan needs to choose what to do. She already has heard of interferon and fears the side effects. Does she also know that not everyone needs treatment and that interferon and ribavirin treatment frequently leads to sustained remission? Does she know that even small amounts of alcohol can contribute to disease progression? She is already immune to hepatitis B but could consider hepatitis A vaccination as a protective mea\u00ad sure. Because adherence to treatment of I year is recom\u00ad mended for genotype I, we would expect that stabilizing her drug abuse behavior would be a good move, and enhance her ability to undergo treatment if necessary. Treatment of hep\u00ad atitis could be beneficial even if she continues to use illicit substances. The decision to treat hepatitis C takes many factors into account, and ideally includes a liver biopsy to establish the level of disease progression. Stigma and misunderstanding about methadone treat\u00ad ment are common among patients, as well as among medical and nursing colleagues, in fact even in addiction treatment programs in which they are euphemistically couched in \"phi\u00ad losophy of care\" jargon. Typically, methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is offered in an outpatient clinic setting that includes daily observed doses of medication, mandated coun\u00ad seling, and random drug testing. This treatment has been repeatedly shown to save lives, reduce seroconversion to HIV, reduce illicit drug use, and increase \"socially productive activity .\"8 A significant portion of the reduced mortality is reduction in opioid overdoses. Most clinics have resources available to address medical and psychiatric comorbidities. There is limited ability to use evidence-based patient place\u00ad ment criteria, such as the ASAM Patient Placement Criteria, in methadone maintenance for several reasons. First, the treatment is heavily regulated to control diversion, so daily visits are mandatory for many months. This schedule may make the treatment less accessible or desirable for working patients, or for those with home or school obligations, or for persons who live far from the clinic site. Second, even if placement criteria requires a higher level of care, such as inpatient, or residential, or intensive hours of outpatient care for the more severely affected patients, referrals to such placement may be hampered by \"no methadone patients\" policy of such programs. For example, should a patient need inpatient care for detoxification from alcohol or benzodiaz\u00ad epines, they might be refused admission because they are enrolled in methadone treatment. Susan's mother's experi\u00ad ence as patients \"hanging around and nodding oft\" illustrates the lack of a continuum of services for MMT patients who may still be using synergistically sedating substances, such as benzodiazepines. Although such patients need a higher level of care, they are forced to choose between the methadone clinic and other treatments, rather than to be able to access treatment according to placement need. Susan's laundry list of reasons to avoid methadone (bones, teeth, weight) is part of long-standing urban legends that stigmatize methadone.\" These statements are not sup\u00ad ported in the medical literature. The physician's list of side effects of methadone is more likely to include constipation (caused by methadone duration of action compared with short-acting abusable opioids) and the logistical difficulties of being tied to a highly regulated clinic. John Renner, MD My initial concern has to do with boundary issues, particularly accepting the child of a colleague into treatment. This would be considered problematic in psychiatry, although the issue is probably less clearly defined in other areas of medicine. I would have considered facilitating referral to another provider but would not have taken the patient into my own practice. My second concern is proceeding with an appointment when a relative, rather than the patient, has made the initial contact. This often blurs the issue about who is motivated for treatment: the parent or the child? My recommendation would have been to say that the patient must call (me, my secretary, or the nurse) to schedule the intake. This does not solve the problem of minimal motivation, but it sends a message about who has to take responsibility for the recovery process. Her history and circumstances suggest that she would be a good candidate for buprenorphine. Despite her misin\u00ad formation and prejudices about methadone, she has been able to function in the community and daily attendance at a methadone clinic might make that more difficult. I would not be particularly concerned about her cocaine and benzodiaz\u00ad epine use, other than suggesting that she see a psychiatrist and/or be screened for an anxiety disorder. Such an evalua\u00ad tion should not be performed until she has stabilized on buprenorphine, at least 3 weeks into treatment. \u00a9 2007 American Society ofAddiction Medicine 76 JAddict Med Volume 1, Number 2, June 2007 Buprenorphine Treatment Given the length of time (9 years) and severity of her addiction (8 failed detoxifications), I would be concerned that she needs more treatment than buprenorphine alone. I would make psychosocial treatment a requirement, rather than just \"educating\" her on the need for other services. At a mini\u00ad mum, this would include a psychiatric evaluation and NAJAA or individual or group counseling. Hopefully, a therapist skilled in l2-step facilitation could help her work through her resistance to 12-step programs. Regarding the induction to buprenorphine, I think the initial plan was appropriate. It is not clear whether the Thursday dose of 16 mg was higher than recommended, but I do not think it unreasonable given her history. The exact frequency of initial visits is not stated, and I am concerned that several weeks have gone by without any visits to NA or the counselor. Not monitoring that situation more closely reinforces the idea that this was not an important part of the treatment plan and reinforces her idea that buprenorphine alone is the \"miracle.\" Her excellent initial response to pharmacotherapy is not unusual in these circumstances, but it may obscure the need for other therapy to ensure long-term success. Her offer to help with buprenorphine training courses could set a dangerous precedent. It is too early to be so sure of success; it reinforces the idea that she is \"special\" and that she has a special relationship with her physician-all of which can be risky. Buying into that idea certainly under\u00ad cuts your ability to enforce the requirement that she partici\u00ad pate in other treatment activities. Her complaints in the second month are suggestive of problems with anxiety and/or depression, certainly not side effects of naloxone. It is of course impossible to separate these complaints from symptoms related to her recurrent drug use. This case highlights the problem of working with coun\u00ad selors who are not educated about buprenorphine and the need for long-term pharmacotherapy. This is a setup for ongoing problems. I am comfortable with keeping the dose at 16 mg because she did not report relapsing as a result of craving or withdrawal symptoms. At this point, I would be more insis\u00ad tent about getting the psychiatric evaluation, a new counselor, and returning to NAJAA. I also would increase the frequency of medication visits and drug testing. I would require all of this to continue treatment, explaining again the risks of pharmacotherapy alone-doing it her way did not work. It is always a judgment call with new patients about whether to require additional treatment. It is easy to try medications alone (as I often do); it then becomes harder to require counseling when the patient seems to be doing well. This case points out the risks but also the reality that you may only have the leverage to require added services after there is some type of lapse or relapse. The mother's call and request for information is clearly a \"trap,\" and violating the patient's confidentiality would be a serious mistake. The initial boundary issue resurfaces and makes it more difficult to manage. The correct response may be to recommend a family meeting, if not family therapy. However, this becomes problematic if one of the family members is a colleague. \u00a9 2007 American Society ofAddiction Medicine Summary Three experts have shared their thoughts regarding the assessment and management of this opioid-dependent person requesting office-based buprenorphine treatment. There was agreement that this patient represented a common clinical scenario with addiction starting with prescription opioids and progressing to intravenous opioid use. All agreed that the patient would be a good candidate for buprenorphine main\u00ad tenance because of her opioid-dependence diagnosis, her failed medication-free treatment history, her family supports, and her ability to function in the community. However, Drs. Martin and Renner expressed some concern about her appro\u00ad priateness for office-based treatment based on her repeated relapse after inpatient care and an unclear level of motivation (mother making the initial phone call). Dr. Martin empha\u00ad sized the need for understanding the patient's treatment goals to better understand her treatment motivation. Although the patient was actively using nonprescribed benzodiazepines, none of the experts considered this a contra\u00ad patients with uncontrolled benzodiazepine use. However, although most clinicians would consider concurrent benzodiazepine abuse a relative and not absolute contraindication, all would treat cautiously and try to avoid prescribing Subutex to such patients. All suggested a need for additional clinical assessment to obtain potentially \"therapeutically useful clues,\" by better understanding the patient's predisposition to addiction, pre\u00ad vious experiences during detoxification, and periods of absti\u00ad nence. All agreed for the need, albeit difficult, to evaluate whether the patient's anxiety was drug-induced or a primary disorder. The consensus was reassessment ofher anxiety after being stabilized on buprenorphine. Dr. Salsitz noted that her anxiety may compromise her ability to engage in group or 12-step facilitated treatment and that she may require indi\u00ad vidual counseling. All 3 experts addressed the unfortunate, but all too common, realities of methadone maintenance stigma and misinformation by patients, the medical community, and sadly, the substance abuse treatment field. The counselor's misinformation about buprenorphine treatment undermined the patient's care. With more than 40 years of literature describing high rates of relapse after detoxification and im\u00ad proved outcomes with maintenance medication, the sugges\u00ad tion of medication discontinuation was clinically inappropri\u00ad ate. All agreed that a switch from Suboxone (buprenorphine/ naloxone) to Subutex (buprenorphine alone) was not indicated. Suboxone was designed as a more diversion-proof medication, whereas Subutex, is vulnerable to abuse. to The importance of concurrent psychosocial treatment was addressed by all 3 experts. In fact, Dr. Renner would have required psychosocial treatment as a condition for start\u00ad ing this patient on buprenorphine. The patient's perceived \"cure\" (freedom of withdrawal and craving symptoms) likely lead to decreased motivation to engage in psychosocial treat\u00ad ment. In my experience, this \"honeymoon period\" of bu\u00ad 77 Alford et al JAddict Med Volume 1, Number 2, June 2007 prenorphine treatment often is followed by boredom (eg, no friends, no job, no school), an abundance of free time, and increased risk for relapse. Both Drs. Salsitz and Martin agreed that the patient's decision to delay hepatitis C evaluation and treatment was appropriate during early recovery. However, Dr. Martin dis\u00ad cussed the need for patient education (eg, alcohol avoidance) and immunization against hepatitis A and B. Finally, the issue of the mother's involvement in her daughter's care was interesting. Although the nonpsychiatrist experts (Drs. Salsitz and Martin) did not express concern for treating a colleague's child, the psychiatrist expert (Dr. Renner) did All the expert\" emphasized the importance of not violating the patient's confidentiality by disclosing information to the mother (eg, drug test results) and suggest that a family meeting may be beneficial.

Arkes, PhD, Victoria A. Shaffer, PhD, Mitchell A. Medow, PhD, MD Objective. To ascertain whether a physician who uses a computer-assisted diagnostic support system (DSS) would be rated less capable than a physician who does not. Method. Students assumed the role of a patient with a possible ankle fracture (experiment 1) 01'a possible deep vein thrombosis (experiment 2). They read a scenario that described an interaction with a physician who used no DSS, one who used an unspecified DSS, 01' one who used a DSS developed at a prestigious medical center. Participants were then asked to rate the interaction on 5 criteria, the most important of which was the diagnostic ability of the physician. In experiment 3, 74 patients in the waiting room of a clinic were randomly assigned to the same 3 types of groups as used in experiment 1. In experiment 4. 13.1 srd-and 4th-year medical students read a scenario ofa physician-patient interaction and were ran\u00ad domly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: the physician used no DSS, heeded the recommendation of a DSS, defied a rec\u00ad ommendation of a DSS by treating in a less aggressive manner, 01' defied a recommendation of a DSS by treating in a more aggressive manner. Results. The participants always deemed the physician who used no decision aid to have the highest diagnostic ability. Conclusion. Patients may surmise that a physician who uses a DSS is not as capable as a physician who makes the diagnosis with no assistance from a DSS. Key words: decision support tech\u00ad niques; diagnosis computer assisted; number of computer-based diagnostic sup\u00ad port systems (DSSs) have been developed during the past 30 years.\" DSSs have been heralded as offer\u00ad ing a way to decrease various types of errors,\" foster the implementation of evidence-based medicine,\" and reduce inappropriate admissions and costs.\" There are strong a priori reasons for believing that computer-based DSSs would improve diagnostic Received 10 February 2005 from the Center for Health Outcomes, Policy. & Evaluation Studies and the Department of Psychology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio (HRA); the Department of Psychology, Wichita State University, Wichita, Kansas (VAS); and the Division of General Internal Medicine.

However, specifically within the domain of medicine, a large number of studies have found that computer-based DSSs perform better than physicians in a wide variety of diagnostic contexts.\"?\" In an early study, de Dombal and colleagues showed that the use of a computer program resulted in significantly more accurate diagnoses of acute appendicitis. Similarly. Corey and Merenstein\" showed that use of a predictive index for acute cardiac ischemia resulted in far more accurate classification of patients than occurred when Downloaded from http://lYlonuwgepub,colTl at BOSTON UNIV on June 17, 2008 \u00a9 2007 Society for Medical Decision Making, All rights reserved. Not for commercial use or unauthorized distribution. 189 ARKES, SHAFFER, MEDOW physicians did not use the index. Ridderikhoff and van Herk\" found that a DSS used in a general practice more than doubled the diagnostic accuracy of unaided physicians. In one of the experiments to be presented in this article, we presented respondents with a sce\u00ad nario describing a sore throat. Several prediction rules have been developed to help physicians diagnose strep throat. 12-14 Another of our scenarios pertains to a possible ankle fracture. A well-known scoring rule has been developed in this domain as well.\" Reviews by Kaplan! and Hunt and colleagues\" con\u00ad firm that although many studies verify the superiority of DSSs in the diagnostic process, some studies do not.\" However, there is unanimity with regard to 1 characteristic of DSSs: they are grossly underused.' To cite 1 example of underutilization, the acute ischemic heart disease predictive instrument put in place by Corey and Merenstein\" reduced the false-positive diag\u00ad nosis rate from 71% to 0%. Following the use of the aid in randomized controlled trials, physicians were free to use the aid or not. Utilization during this latter phase was only 2.8%. Other examples of underutiliza\u00ad tion abound.1s-zz A number of reasons have been proposed to explain why diagnosticians might not want to use computer-assisted DSSs or any other actuarial system such as a practice guideline.2o.23.24 These reasons include the reluctance to use \"cookbook medicine,\" inertia of previous practice, and lack of agreement with the output of the DSS.19 .20 One additional and potentially important reason why physicians might be reluctant to use computer-based DSSs was sug\u00ad gested in a short report by Cruikshank.\" Using only 3 British physicians in his study, Cruikshank\" assessed patients' opinions of their physicians before and after a computer-assisted diagnostic tool was introduced. Even though such a decision aid was designed to reduce diagnostic errors, patients were markedly less positive about the thoroughness, clev\u00ad erness, decisiveness, and thoughtfulness of their physician after the decision aid was introduced. A physician who values his or her reputation may be understandably reluctant to use a computer-based DSS if its use has this detrimental effect. However, this study was published in 1984, when the use of computers was drastically less prevalent than it is today. Therefore, the wariness patients might have had concerning the use of a novel machine might not be present in today's computer-saturated environ\u00ad ment. Note that we are not investigating patients' attitudes toward physicians' use of computerized medical records, which have generally not been negative.20.27Instead. we are specifically interested in 190 MEDICAL DECISION MAKING/MAR-APR 2007 whether patients would derogate the diagnostic ability of a physician who uses a computer-based DSS com\u00ad pared to the rating given by a patient to a physician who does not use such an aid. EXPERIMENT 1 Method Participants In total, 347 undergraduate students at The Ohio State University participated in the experiment in partial fulfillment of a course requirement. The par\u00ad ticipants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 experi\u00ad mental groups: no aid (n = 108), aid (n = 127), and prestigious aid (n = 112). Materials The experiment employed 3 short scenarios that described an interaction between a doctor and her patient, a brief questionnaire containing the target\u00ad dependent variables, and a numeracy scale that con\u00ad tained 3 questions. The questions were the \"General Numeracy Items\" from Lipkus and colleagues ,28 which were in turn adapted from Schwartz and col\u00ad leagues.\" We hypothesized that facility with numeri\u00ad cal concepts might foster greater acceptance of DSSs. All stimulus materials were presented, and all data were collected via computer. Procedure Each participant read a I-page scenario in which he or she was asked to take the role of the patient. In the scenario, the patient had an ankle injury and went to see a primary care physician, who provided a diagno\u00ad sis. In the course of the diagnostic process, the doctor used no decision aid, an unspecified decision aid, or a prestigious decision aid. After reading the scenario, the participants were asked to rate the following 5 cri\u00ad teria: thoroughness of examination, length of wait, diagnostic ability of the physician, professionalism of the physician, and overall satisfaction with the examination. Participants were asked to respond to each question separately using 5 different Likert-type scales; each scale ranged from 1 to 7. The more nega\u00ad tive evaluations corresponded to the left side of the scale and the more positive evaluations with the right. Each point on the scale was given both a numeric value and a descriptive label. After they responded to the dependent variables, the participants were asked to respond to the numeracy scale (see Appendix A for the scenarios and numeracy scale).

DEROGATION OF PHYSICIANS WHO USE A DIAGNOSI1C AID Table 1 Experiment 1 Group Means Group Prestigious Dependent Variable No Aid Aid Aid Diagnostic ability 4.69\" 3.70b 3.37\" 3.18\" Note: Within a row, means not sharing a common superscript differ sig\u00ad nificantly by a Kruskal-Wallis test (P < 0.05). Results A numeracy score was calculated for each partici\u00ad pant by tallying the number of correct items from the 3-item scale. The average numeracy score was 1.83. For all dependent variables except \"length of wait,\" the physician who used no decision aid was given the highest evaluation. See Table 1 for the means of all dependent variables. Significant Pearson correlations existed between the 5 dependent variables, ranging from .302 to .781. The 5 dependent variables were subjected to a mul\u00ad tivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA); the covariate was numeracy score, and the single factor was experimental condition: no aid, aid, and presti\u00ad gious aid. The numeracy score was not a significant covariate for any of the 5 dependent variables. Numeracy data were also collected in the subsequent 3 experiments; however, numeracy was not a signifi\u00ad cant covariate in any study. Therefore, the numeracy data will not be addressed again in this article. Significant F values were obtained for the factor of experimental condition in 4 of the 5 dependent vari\u00ad ables: thoroughness of examination, diagnostic ability, professionalism, and overall satisfaction. The evalua\u00ad tion of a patient's length of wait did not differ signifi\u00ad cantly between the 3 experimental groups. However, responses in the no-aid condition were significantly less variable for 4 of the dependent variables (thor\u00ad oughness of examination, diagnostic ability, profes\u00ad sionalism, and overall satisfaction). Therefore, the parametric analysis of variance (ANOVA) was rejected in favor ofthe nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test, which provides an omnibus test for differences in ranks. Kruskal-Wallis tests yielded significant differences (P < 0.05) in thoroughness of examina\u00ad tion, X2(2) = 6.70; diagnostic ability. 33.90; professionalism, = 15.82; and overall satisfac\u00ad tion, X2(2) = 8.86. Subsequent post hoc comparisons indicated that the no-aid group was rated signifi\u00ad cantly higher than the prestigious-aid group for all 4 dependent variables (P < 0.05). For 3 of these 4 vari\u00ad ables, the no-aid group was rated significantly higher than the aid group (P < 0.05), with \"thoroughness of the examination\" not reaching significance. In con\u00ad trast, the aid and prestigious-aid groups did not differ significantly on any of the 4 dependent variables. Discussion The data from our 1st experiment suggest that patients' perceptions of their physicians are influ\u00ad enced by the use of decision aids during routine vis\u00ad its. The participants' evaluation of the physician's diagnostic ability, the thoroughness of the examina\u00ad tion, the professionalism of the physician, and their overall evaluation of the physician were affected by our experimental conditions. The physician who did not use a decision aid was rated more favorably on all 4 dimensions by our participants than the physicians who used an unspecified decision aid or a highly prestigious decision aid. Numeracy scores, found to be a factor in other studies about medical [udgments.r':\" did not significantly affect the evalu\u00ad ations given in this experiment. Based on the results of Cruikshank,\" we expected group differences on the dependent variable pertain\u00ad ing to the diagnostic ability of the physician. We did not anticipate that the use of a computer-assisted DSS would also influence such factors as the thor\u00ad oughness of the examination because the groups did not differ in the amount of data collected by the physician or offered by the patient. Nevertheless, group differences did occur on 4 of the 5 factors. Perhaps our conclusions were specific to the type of injury; maybe participants believed that a poten\u00ad tial ankle fracture was such a common occurrence that physicians should be able to treat the injury without the use of a diagnostic aid. Therefore, we decided to replicate our findings with a 2nd, bu t potentially more serious, medical condition-deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Because DVT is potentially more dangerous than an ankle fracture, we thought that it would be advisable to ascertain if the same general pattern of findings would occur in this new situation. In addition, because the use of a \"prestigious\" aid did not affect diagnostic ability, only 2 groups (no aid and aid) were used with this population.

The par\u00ad ticipants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 experi\u00ad mental groups: no aid (n = 55) and aid (n = 73). Materials The experiment employed 2 short scenarios that described an interaction between a doctor and her patient and a brief questionnaire containing the tar\u00ad get dependent variables. All stimulus materials were presented, and all data were collected via computer. Procedure Each participant read a t-page scenario in which he or she was asked to take the role of the patient. In the scenario, the patient had a leg injury and was at risk for DVT. The patient went to see a primary care physician, who provided a diagnosis. In the course of the diagnostic process, the doctor used either no decision aid or an unspecified decision aid (see Appendix B for the text of the scenario). After read\u00ad ing the scenario, the participants were asked to rate the following 6 criteria: perceived difficulty of diag\u00ad nosis, thoroughness of examination, length of wait, diagnostic ability of the physician, professionalism of the physician, and overall satisfaction with the examination. Participants were asked to respond to each question separately using 6 different Likert\u00ad type scales constructed in a manner identical to those in experiment 1. Results Responses to diagnostic ability and thoroughness of examination were significantly more variable in the aid condition. Therefore, the appropriate statistical correc\u00ad tion in the degrees of freedom was made for t tests involving these variables. In addition, significant posi\u00ad tive Pearson correlations existed between 5 of the dependent variables (thoroughness of examination, length of wait, diagnostic ability of the physician, pro\u00ad fessionalism of the physician, and overall satisfaction with the examination); correlations ranged from .342 to .820. Perceived difficulty of diagnosis was negatively correlated with professionalism (r = -.202, P < 0.05). See Table 2 for the means of all dependent variables. 192 MEDICAL DECISION MAKINGIMAR-APR 2007 Table 2 Experiment 2 Group Means Group Dependent Variable No Aid Aid Diagnostic ability\" Perceived difficultv Overall satisfaction Professionalism\" 3.02 4.05 3.88 4.15 4.78 5.11 3.00 a. According to a t test. the 2 groups differed on this dependent variable (P <: 0.05). Again, participants in the aid condition gave sig\u00ad nificantly lower ratings to the target dependent vari\u00ad able, diagnostic ability, t(125.93) = 3.53, P < 0.01, Cohen d = .54. In addition, participants in the aid con\u00ad dition also deemed the physicians to be less profes\u00ad sional, t(126) =2.62, P < 0.01, Cohen d =.43, and less thorough, t(125.95) =1.743, P < 0.05, Cohen d = .27. There were no significant differences between the no\u00ad aid and aid conditions on perceived difficulty, overall satisfaction, and length of wait. Discussion The data from experiment 2 replicated the find\u00ad ings from experiment 1 using a more serious medical condition. The evaluation of a physician was again influenced by the use of a diagnostic aid. To improve the generality of our conclusions, we decided to replicate our study with a nonstudent population and a scenario that used a different mal\u00ad ady. We wanted to ascertain whether the results found in experiment 1 would generalize to patients who were seeking medical care. EXPERIMENT 3 Method Participants In total, 74 patients from the University Health Connections clinic, an urgent and primary care service for faculty and staff at The Ohio State University, par\u00ad ticipated in this experiment. Each patient was paid $25 for participation. The participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 experimental groups: no aid (n = 24). aid (n =27), and prestigious aid (n =22).

All data were collected using paper-and-pencil materials in the lobby of the University Health Connections clinic. Appendix C contains the scenarios. Procedure When participants checked in at the receptionist desk at the University Health Connections clinic to receive medical treatment, they were approached by either a receptionist or a researcher and asked to par\u00ad ticipate in the experiment. Those patients who gave their consent were given a packet that contained the patient-doctor scenario and the questionnaire contain\u00ad ing the 5 dependent variables. The dependent vari\u00ad ables (thoroughness of examination, evaluation of length of wait, diagnostic ability, professionalism, and overall satisfaction with the examination) were identi\u00ad cal to those in experiment 1. However, the scenario in experiment 1, which described an ankle injury, was replaced with a scenario in which the patient had a persistent cough. Again, the participant was asked to take the role of the patient who went to see his or her primary care physician and was subsequently pro\u00ad vided with a diagnosis. In the course of the diagnostic process, the doctor employed no decision aid, an unspecified decision aid, or a prestigious decision aid. After reading the scenario, the participants were asked to rate the physician on the 5 criteria. Participants were asked to respond to each question separately using 5 different Likert-type scales constructed in the same manner as those used in the prior 2 studies. Results The 5 dependent variables (thoroughness of exami\u00ad nation, evalnation of length of wait, diagnostic ability, professionalism, and overall satisfaction) were sub\u00ad jected to a MANOVA with the single independent variable of experimental condition: no aid, aid, and prestigious aid. See Table 3 for the means of all vari\u00ad ables. A significant Fvalue was obtained for the target variable, diagnostic ability, F(2, 68) = 4.94, P < 0.05, 112 =.12. Tukey post hoc tests revealed significant dif\u00ad ferences between the aid and no-aid groups, P < 0.05. Patients at the University Health Connections clinic awarded the highest rating for diagnostic ability to the physician who used no decision aid. There were no significant differences in experimental condition for the remaining 4 dependent variables: thoroughness of DECISION SUPPORT TECHNIQUES Table 3 Experiment 3 Group Means Group Prestigious Dependent Variable No Aid Aid Aid Diagnostic ability\" 4.71 3.52 4.41 Overall satisfaction 5.00 4.55 Length wait 3.46 3.44 3.58 a. According to a Tukey post hoc test, the aid and no-aid grou ps dif\u00ad fered significantly on this dependent variable (P < 0.05). examination, evaluation of length of wait, profession\u00ad alism, and overall satisfaction. Significant Pearson correlations were obtained between pairs of depen\u00ad dent variables ranging from .261 to .862. Discussion The diagnostic ability of the physician was again rated significantly higher when she used no computer-assisted DSS compared to the rating given when she did use a computer-assisted DSS. This result replicated experiment 1 and experiment 2, Unlike experiment 1, however, the use of a presti\u00ad gious aid-developed at the Mayo Clinic-mitigated the patients' derogation of the physician; no signifi\u00ad cant difference was detected between the no-aid and prestigious-aid groups. The other dependent variables did not differ sig\u00ad nificantly as a function of DSS use. A likely reason for this variation between the 2 experiments is that there were far fewer participants in experiment 3 than in both experiment 1 and experiment 2, which meant lower power to detect significant differences: in this experiment. the power for thoroughness of examina\u00ad tion, professionalism of physician, and overall satis\u00ad faction ranged from .181 to .429. Furthermore, the difference between the ratings given to the overall sat\u00ad isfaction and thoroughness of the examination depen\u00ad dent variables by the aid and no-aid groups was actually greater in experiment 3 than in experiments 1 and 2. To expand the generality of our findings, we decided to use medical students in experiment 4 rather than undergraduate students (experiments 1 and 2) or patients (experiment 3). We thought it was important to ascertain if those who were training to be physi\u00ad cians had the same opinion as laypersons with regard to doctors' use of decision aids.

Materials The experiment employed both the ankle and DVT scenarios that described an interaction between a doctor and a patient plus a brief questionnaire con\u00ad taining the target-dependent variables. Procedure An e-mail was sent to all 3rd- and 4th-year medical students at The Ohio State University soliciting their participation in this study. All participants were promised and paid $25. Of the 403 eligible medical students, 131 (33%) responded to our invitation to participate. Approximately half of the participants read a modified version of the ankle fracture scenario used in experiment 1 (n = 68). The other participants read the DVT scenario (n = 63). Some of the groups in this experiment differed from those used in the prior 3 experiments. In addi\u00ad tion to the usual no-aid group (n = 33) were 3 new ones. In the 1st new group, the physician used a decision aid and explicitly heeded the recommen\u00ad dation of the aid (n = 30). In the 2nd group, the physician used a decision aid, explicitly defied the recommendation of the aid, and treated the patient in a less aggressive manner than the recommenda\u00ad tion (n = 38). In the final new group, the physician used a decision aid, explicitly defied the recom\u00ad mendation of the aid, and treated the patient in a more aggressive manner than the recommendation (n = 30). We wanted to contrast these final 2 groups because of the results of prior research that suggests that physicians prefer overtreatment to undertreat\u00ad ment,'JO,31 and medical student raters might therefore be more favorably disposed toward a physician who treats more aggressively-but not less aggressively\u00ad than a decision aid might recommend. The same dependent variables were used as in the prior 3 studies with the addition of 2 questions. First, all participants were asked, \"How do you think that other physicians would regard you if you did use a computer-assisted diagnostic aid in making a diagno\u00ad sis in a case such as this one?\" Respondents could 194 MEDICAL DECISION MAKINGIMAR-APR 2007 answer by marking a 7-point scale whose labels varied from extremely negative to extremely positive, Second, all participants were asked, \"If you did usc such a decision aid in making a diagnosis and an adverse medical outcome occurred. do you think using the aid would make you more vulnerable or more protected to a claim of malpractice?\" Respondents could answer by marking a 7-point scale whose labels varied from extremely vulnerable to extremely protected. Results The 8 dependent variables (malpractice vulnera\u00ad bility. opinion of colleagues, perceived difficulty of diagnosis, thoroughness of examination, evaluation of length of wait, diagnostic ability, professionalism, and overall satisfaction) were subjected to a MANOVA with 2 factors: scenario (ankle or DVT) and experi\u00ad mental group (no aid. heed aid. defy aid by treat\u00ad ing less aggressively, defy aid by treating more aggressively). As was the case in experiment 2, only the diag\u00ad nostic ability of the physician was significantly affected by the aid manipulation (no aid, aid heeded, aiel defied less aggressively, and aid defied more aggressively), F(3, 128) = 3.71, P < 0.05, 1']2 = .08. See Table 4 for means. The physician who used no DSS was given the highest rating (4.70), whereas the physician who used the aid but defied the output of the aid by treating in a less aggressive manner was given the lowest rating (3.84). A significant differ\u00ad ence (using Tukey post hoc procedure) was found between the no-aid group and the \"defy-less aggres\u00ad sive\" group (P < 0.05). Although it was not of central interest, there was a significant main effect of scenario for several depen\u00ad dent variables: perceived difficulty, F(l, 130) = 86.90, P < 0.05; thoroughness of examination. F(l, 130) c= 30.09, P < 0.05; wait time, F(l, 130) = 10.83, P < and pro\u00ad fessionalism, F(l, 5.00. P < 0.05, The ankle sce\u00ad nario received significantly greater ratings of wait time and perceived difficulty of diagnosis. Physicians in the DVT scenario were perceived as more thorough and professional, and they were given higher ratings of diagnostic ability. Although no group differences were found on the question pertaining to vulnerability to malpractice, it is interesting to note that the medical students provided an average rating of 4.21, which was slightly toward the \"protected\" end of the scale.

According to a Tukey post hoc test. the no-aid and aid defy\u00ad less aggressive groups differed significantly on this dependent variable (P < 0.05), Discussion We again found that the physician who used no decision aid was rated the highest in diagnostic abil\u00ad ity. The physician who used an aid but defied it by treating in a less aggressive manner was deemed to have significantly less diagnostic ability. This mirrors the results of Pezzo and Pezzo,\" who found in their experiment 2 that a physician who defied the recom\u00ad mendation of a decision aid was considered to be less competent than one who heeded its recommendation. Pezza and Pezzo\" found no significant difference in rated competence between those physicians who defied an aid and those who used no aid, a difference we did find in our study. However, a major difference between the procedure in their study and ours was that in their study, an adverse outcome occurred. As we suspected, the physician in our study who defied the aid and treated in a more aggressive manner was rated higher than the physician who defied the aid and treated in a less aggressive manner, but this dif\u00ad ference was not significant. GENERAL DISCUSSION In both experiment 1 and experiment 2, we found that respondents derogated the diagnostic ability of physicians who used a computer-based DSS. In experiment 1, we also found evidence that other DECISION SUPPORT TECHNIQUES characteristics of the physician, such as professional\u00ad ism, were also rated lower if a DSS was used. Unfortu\u00ad nately, patients' derogation of physicians who use a decision aid might be a defensible response, even if the aid does promote accurate judgment performance. According to social psychology's discounting princi\u00ad ple,\" whenever an effect has 2 possible causes, a per\u00ad ceiver tends to emphasize one cause and discount the other. Thus, if a correct diagnosis is made, and its accu\u00ad racy can be attributed to either the skill of the physi\u00ad cian or the output of the computer-assisted decision aid, it may be understandable why the perceiver lllay attribute some component of the accuracy to the aid rather than attributing all of it to the person. Consistent with this analysis, Pezzo and Pezzo'\" found that com\u00ad pared to a situation in which a physician did not use a decision aid, if a physician did use the decision aid, he or she was rated less positive following a good out\u00ad come and less negative following a bad one. Raters apparently attributed to the aid some of the credit or blame for the outcome, thus reducing the magnitude of the impact of the outcome on their evaluation of the physician. An unfortunate consequence ofthis attribu\u00ad tion is that it may make decision makers less willing to use the decision aid for fear of appearing less capable should the outcome be a typical positive one. Because patients want their physician to be extremely knowl\u00ad edgeable (if not omniscient), the physician who appears to rely on a DSS may be risking the patient's otherwise high regard. The physician prudent enough to employ a helpful aid should be thanked-not dero\u00ad gated. We hasten to point out that this attributional complexity is germane not only to the medical arena but to virtually all other domains in which profes\u00ad sional judgment is required. The discounting principle may be involved whenever a decision maker's ability and the decision aid's precision are each possible causes of a professional judgment. We were surprised in experiment 1 that the inde\u00ad pendent variable significantly influenced not only the rated diagnostic ability of the physician-the depen\u00ad dent variable on which we anticipated the greatest impact-but 3 of the 4 additional dependent variables too. Some of these additional factors, such as the thoroughness of the examination, would not seem to be directly related to the use of a diagnostic aid. However, another social psychology principle, the \"halo effect,\" might apply here.\" This effect pertains to the phenomenon in which an evaluation of 1 par\u00ad ticular salient trait of a person influences the evalu\u00ad ation of other traits of that same person.

Possible Theoretical Frameworks Loss of the Aura of Omniscience Kaplan\" suggests that doctors' negative attitudes toward and underutilization of decision aids might both be fueled by the fear that the use of such aids might diminish their professional status. Our data sug\u00ad gest that this fear might be well founded in that patients rate the physician who uses an aid as a less competent diagnostician than a physician who acts without such assistance. Abundant research suggests that people think they can do better than a decision aid. For example, Arkes and colleagues\" demon\u00ad strated that baseball experts were reluctant to use a decision rule despite the fact that it would have improved their performance significantly on a baseball\u00ad related judgment task. The experts were confident that they could do well without the helpful rule. Whitecotton\" showed that there was a significant negative correlation between the confidence that pro\u00ad fessional financial analysts manifested toward the forecasting task that confronted them and their will\u00ad ingness to use a decision aid to perform the task. If we assume that those who hire the experts are as confi\u00ad dent in the experts' performance as the experts them\u00ad selves are, this would explain why patients have a relatively negative view toward expert diagnosticians who do not seem self-assured enough to eschew a decision aid. Intuition v. Analysis Insight and creativity are often associated with intuitive thinking. We admire such attributes. Analysis, on the other hand, seems tedious and opaque to a layperson. Latham and Whyte'\" and Whyte and Latharrr\" investigated the relative per\u00ad suasiveness of advice provided to managers either by an unaided expert or by an expert who had per\u00ad formed a utility analysis to support his or her rec\u00ad ommendation. Although the advice was identical, the recommended course of action was less likely to be supported by the managers if it were predicated on the utility analysis. The fact that the merits of the utility analysis were explained by an expert who was an \"internationally recognized authority\" did not seem to impress the managers in a positive way. We hypothesize that patient-raters might have an opinion similar to that of the managers in the 196 MEDICAL DECISION MAKINGIMAR-APR 2007 aforementioned research. The unaided physician is analogous to the unaided expert who uses only intu\u00ad ition. The physician who uses a DSS is analogous to the expert who uses a decision analysis. In both sit\u00ad uations, the person who uses his or her own intu\u00ad ition benefits, either by having the advice heeded or by being given higher evaluations. One difference in the 2 domains is that in the utility analysis study by Whyte and Latham,\" the support of a prestigious expert did not seem to help. In our experiment 3, we did find that when patients learned that the aid had been developed at the prestigious Mayo Clinic, the derogation usually visited upon the physician who used a decision aid was largely mitigated. Several authors have suggested reasons why people trust intuition more than analysis.P\" Among the most prominent is the suspicion that some important intu\u00ad itions are performed without awareness and therefore cannot be expressed in analytic terms; this would therefore render them unavailable for inclusion in a decision aid. Whether this suspicion is warranted is a matter of debate.t\":\" Case-Specific Data v. Base Rates DSS tools gain their power from being based on a large amount of prior information-namely, the base rates of various diseases and the likelihood ratios that describe the probability of having a particular symp\u00ad tom given the presence of each disease. An abundance of psychological research compels the conclusions that most people clonot 1) think that base rates are rel\u00ad evant,\" 2) use them appropriately when they are pre\u00ad sented,\" or 3) consider them to be as probative as individuating information.\" We want our physician to see us as individuals. Each of us is unique, and each of us wants to be treated accordingly. If a DSS lumps each of us with all the other people whose data go into the base rates or likelihood ratios, we feel minimized or even disregarded.\"? A physician who uses a DSS that offends us in this manner is going to be derogated compared to a physician who appears to appreciate our individuality, even though the latter physician may not be as accurate a diagnostician as the former. The Issue of Generality A number of factors that varied between and within the 4 experiments did not qualify the general finding that physicians who used no decision aid were deemed to be more capable than at least some physicians who did. In experiments 1, 2, and 4, the pronouns used in the scenario would lead one to conclude that the Downloaded from http://lrlam.sagepub.coIYlatBOSTONUNIVonJune17,2008 \u00a9 2007 Society for Medical Decision Making.

In experiment 3, the physi\u00ad cian was a male. The principal result was the same in all studies. In experiment 2, the medical condition was more serious than that in experiments 1 and 3. The prin\u00ad cipal results were the same in all 3 studies. In experiments 1 and 2, the participants were younger than those in experiments 3 and 4. The prin\u00ad cipal results were the same. In experiment 4, the participants were in training to be physicians, whereas the participants in the other studies were laypersons. Again, the principal result was the same. We conclude that our principal finding has sub\u00ad stantial generality. The common pattern of results in all 4 experiments is depicted in Figure 1. External Validity Reviewers of a prior draft of this article have ques\u00ad tioned whether various aspects of our scenarios faith\u00ad fully depict a typical doctor-patient interaction. For example, would a patient normally be aware of the fact that the physician has used a decision aid'? In order for us to manipulate this independent variable, the participant in our research who was taking the role of the patient had to be made aware of whether the physician was using a decision aid. Thus, to investigate the influence of this factor, we had to make the presence of the aid quite explicit. From per\u00ad sonal experience, we know that patients sometimes are aware of the fact that the physician has consulted a reference book, a colleague, or a journal article. We wanted to investigate what would be the patient's atti\u00ad tude if a computer-assisted aid were consulted instead. DECISION SUPPORT TECHNIQUES Another closely related issue pertains to the con\u00ad text in which the aid was used. Perhaps a patient's attitude toward the physician who used a DSS would vary depending on whether the aid was used to make the initial diagnosis, corroborate a physi\u00ad cian's own diagnosis, amalgamate a large number of complex laboratory tests, make the final diagnosis, or even override a physician's intuition. Of course, all of these are potentially important qualifications of our main finding. In our experiment 1, our sce\u00ad nario included the following: \"she is using a com\u00ad puter program to decide whether to order an X-ray of your ankle.\" In experiment 3, we used the following: \"he explains that to help make the diagnosis, he is using a computer program.\" Compared to its helping or consultative role in experiment 3, the DSS seems to be playing a more direct role in making the diag\u00ad nosis in experiment 1. In both cases, the physician who used no decision aid was rated as more compe\u00ad tent than the physician who did use an aid. Future research might wish to diminish the role of the deci\u00ad sian aid even further to ascertain if the effect remains when the aid's role becomes truly nominal. Another feature of our scenarios is that the use of a DSS may have delayed or frustrated a person who expected the physician to respond immediately with the recommended course of action. In experiment 1. the patient in the scenario had already waited 45 min\u00ad utes, and the additional wait while the DSS was being used may have been particularly aversive. This extra delay may have been a source of some of the displea\u00ad sure directed toward the physician who used a diag\u00ad nostic aid. To the extent the use of an aid does not result in any delay or does not follow a wait for an already tardy and harried health care provider, patients may be less negative toward the physician who employs a DSS. The results of these studies pose a problem for a physician who believes that computer-assisted DSSs improve diagnostic accuracy, as several studies sug\u00ad gest.\":\" Using such decision aids may indeed increase diagnostic accuracy, but they might also simultaneously decrease the patient's opinion of the physician's diagnostic ability.

Your teammates, one of whom is a physical therapist, helped you to the side and got some ice for your ankle from the concession stand. Your friend gave you a ride home and helped you to your couch. She recom\u00ad mended that you see your physician tomorrow. Until then, you kept your ankle elevated, used ice, and took some ibuprofen for the pain. Early the next morning, at 7:30 AM, you called your physician's office. The recorded message said they do not take calls for appointments for another hour and a half. You called back promptly 90 minutes later and got an appointment later that afternoon. You managed to go to work, using an ornamental walking stick you brought back from a trip. In the afternoon, you left work early to get to your appointment. After a 30-minute wait, a nurse takes you to an examination room. The nurse asks you what the problem is, and you respond that you injured your left ankle yesterday playing softball. The nurse takes your temperature (98.7\u00b0), measures your blood pressure (122/78), takes your pulse (78 beats per minute), measures your respiratory rate (16 breaths per minute), and asks you to step on the scale. The nurse writes this information in the chart and then leaves. You want to ask her if you should get an X-ray to help move things along, but she left before you had a chance. About 15 minutes later, the doctor comes into the room and asks you a number of questions: 1. When did this happen? Last evening. 2. What were you doing? Playing softball. 3. Describe the accident. When I landed, my ankle turned in. I could not walk on it. My friends helped me to the side and got some ice for it. The ankle swelled up. and there seems to be a bruise over the outer part of it. 4. Can you walk on it now? No, I cannot put my full weight on it. I must use this walking stick. 5. Have you ever injured your ankle before? Yes, but only minor twists. In addition, the doctor asks you some more questions: Do you have any drug allergies'? No. Do you have any other major health problems'? No. 198 MEDICAL DECISION MAKINGIMAR-APR 2007 The doctor uses her stethoscope to listen to your lungs as you breathe deeply and to your heart while you lie back quietly. She then examines your ankles: your left ankle is puffy. There is a visible black and blue mark on the outside, over the bone. When she pushes over the bone on the outside of the ankle. it is tender. She moves it side to side and back and forth. It is beginning to throb. She asks you to walk on it without the walking stick. You are unable to. The doctor asks you to sit down again. [Additional text for aid scenario: The doctor then turns to a computer in the room, explaining that she is using a computer program to decide whether to order an X-ray of your ankle.

DEROGATION OF PHYSICIANS WHO USE A DIAGNOSTIC AID the role of a patient, read the story, and then, using your own medical knowledge and experience, give us your candid opinion of this physician. After 5 days at home with a painful, swollen right leg, you decide to go to the doctor's office. You wait in the waiting room for about 30 minutes with approximately a half-dozen other people. Some of them are coughing, sneezing, and blowing their noses; you find the atmosphere very noisy. After the 3D-minute wait, a nurse takes you to an examination room. The nurse asks you what the problem is, and you respond that you've had a very swollen and sore leg for 5 days. after spraining your ankle skiing. The nurse takes your temperature (98.7\u00b0), measures your blood pressure (122/78), takes your pulse (78 beats per minute), measures your respiratory rate (16 breaths per minute), and asks you to step on the scale so you can be weighed. The nurse writes this information in the chart and then leaves you alone in the room. About 15 minutes later. the doctor comes into the room. The doctor asks you a large number of questions: Why did you come to the doctor's office today'? You repeat that your leg has been painful and swollen for 5 days after you sprained your ankle skiing. Can you walk on the leg? You could after the acci\u00ad dent. but for the last 3 days, you have stayed off of your leg. In fact, the ankle feels much better, but the leg itself hurts. Has anyone examined the leg since the injury'! After the accident, the local emergency department exam\u00ad ined and X-rayed the leg. The emergency department physician told you that it was just a sprain-you did not tear any ligaments and did not fracture any bones. Do you have paralysis, paresis (weakness], or recent cast immobilization of the lower extremities? No, you used an Ace wrap on the ankle for a couple of days. Have you recently been bedridden for more than 3 days? No, you have not stayed in bed but have been lying on the couch with your leg elevated most ofthe time since the accident. You have been getting up to go to the bathroom, make yourself meals. and stretch out occasionally. Have you recently traveled anywhere. sitting still for 4 or more hours'? Yes, the trip home from the ski resort took 6 hours. Do you have active cancer, are you being treated for cancer, have you been treated for cancer within the previous 6 months. or are you now having palliative care? No. DECISION SUPPORT TECHNIQUES Have you had major surgery within 4 weeks'! No. Have you ever had a blood clot? No. Has anyone in your family ever had a blood clot? No. Have you been running any fevers or had shaking chills? No. Have you had any recent bug bites, cuts, or scrapes on the leg? No. Do you have a cough? No. Have you coughed up any blood? No. Can you feel your heart pounding'! No, Are you short of breath'? No. In addition, the doctor asks you some more questions: Do you have any drug allergies? No. Do you have any other major health problems'!' No. Do you bleed easily? No. Have you ever had a stroke or an ulcer'! No. The doctor uses her stethoscope to listen to your heart and your lungs as you breathe deeply. She exam\u00ad ines your legs: your right leg is swollen to just above the knee and is tender to gentle squeezing throughout. It is warm to the touch but not red. The right calf is 1.5 inches in diameter larger than your left leg. Ifyou push on the leg, you can see the indentation after you remove your finger. The veins on your leg are not evident. Your doctor explains to you that she is very concerned that you have a blood clot in your leg (a \"deep venous thrombosis,\" she calls it), This can be dangerous, even fatal. So, she wants to check some blood test and send you immediately for a test (a \"duplex ultrasound\") to see if there is a clot in your right leg. She says she will be right back, after she arranges for the test. Twenty minutes later, the nurse returns to the room. First, the nurse draws some blood. Then the nurse tells you that the test has been ordered. The nurse then takes you over to the test in a wheelchair and tells you that someone will come and pick you up when the test is over. The test takes 20 minutes, but then you wait an hour before someone brings you back to the clinic. In the clinic, you wait for another 15 minutes before the doctor comes in to see you. She sits down and exam\u00ad ines the test results. After a brief pause. she tells you that these tests do not show a blood clot in the leg. The doctor says that you should take ibuprofen and use hot/cold packs for the pain. [NO DECISION AIDl However, the doctor says that you are at intermediate risk for a deep venous Downloaded from l,ttp:lirndrn.sagepub.cDlrl at BOSTON UNIV on June 17 2008 \u00a9 2007 Society for Medical Decision Making.

You make an appointment 1 week from now. [COMPUTER DECISION AID] The doctor then turns to a computer in the room, explaining to you that she is using a computer program to decide what to do next. According to this decision aid, you are at intermediate risk for a deep venous thrombosis, and the \"advice\" from the decision aid is that the duplex ultrasound should be done again in 1 week. So you make an appointment 1 week from now. \u00ad Before you leave, the doctor proceeds to explain to you how a blood clot is treated, just in case you do eventually develop a clot. You would be admitted to the hospital for 4 to 7 days. First an intravenous (IV) blood thinner will be started, and then a pill form of a blood thinner will be started. When your blood is thin enough, the IV thinner will be stopped and you can go home on the pill. You will probably remain on the pill for 6 months. After hearing this explanation, you leave the doctor's office. APPENDIX C Experiment 3 Cough Scenarios NO-AID SCENARIO After 5 days with a particularly bad sore throat, you decide to go to the doctor. You wait in the wait\u00ad ing room for about 30 minutes with approximately a half-dozen other people. Some of them are coughing, sneezing, and blowing their nose. After the 3D-minute wait, a nurse takes you to an examination room. The nurse asks you what the prob\u00ad lem is, and you respond that you've had a very sore throat for 5 days. It's really hard for you to speak to the nurse because your throat is so sore. Your voice is extremely hoarse. The nurse takes your temperature [99.5\u00b0), measures your blood pressure [120/80), and asks you to step on the scale. The nurse writes this information in the chart and then leaves. About 15 minutes later, the doctor comes into the room. The doctor asks you a large number of questions concerning the following: 1. Whether you have been coughing up blood (no) 2. What color the material is that you do cough up (yellow) 3. When the sore throat started (5 days ago) 4. Whether you have any chest pain (no) 5. Whether you are on any medications at the current time (no) 200 MEDICAL DECISION MAKINGIMAR-APR 2007 6. Whether the sore throat is more painful when you swallow (yes) 7. Whether you've had a lot of nasal congestion (yes) The doctor also uses his stethoscope to listen to your heart and then to listen to your lungs as you breathe deeply. He then asks more questions: 1. Do you have allergies? (yes, ragweed) 2. Do you have asthma? (no) 3. Have you ever had pneumonia? (no) Although the doctor did not ask you about the topic, you volunteer the information that during the last several years, you've been treated for several uri\u00ad nary and kidney infections. He then feels the lymph nodes under your jaw in order to determine if they are swollen. [They are.) He looks in your ears and asks if you have had any earaches in the last few days. You say that you have had a couple of earaches. The doctor then says that he will order some labora\u00ad tory tests. First, he takes a swab and brushes it against the back of your throat. He says that he wants to get a culture in case there is a strep infection. He says that he wants to get a chest X-ray because he wants to get a better idea of the condition of your lungs. He says that he detected some fluid when he listened to vour lunas_ 0 with the stethoscope. He says that the nurse will return to take a blood sample. He says that the laboratory tests will be back tomorrow and that you should stop by tomorrow early in the afternoon. He writes a prescrip\u00ad tion, which he tells you to get filled right away. The nurse comes in and draws some blood from your left arm. Then you go get the chest X-ray. When you finish with the X-rays, you go to the pharmacy to get the pre\u00ad scription filled. You go home, take the medicine, and spend the rest of the day in bed. The following day, you stop back in the early after\u00ad noon for your 1 PM appointment. You wait about 30 minutes, and then you are called into the examination room. The nurse again takes your temperature [99.5\u00b0) and blood pressure (120/80). The doctor comes in 10 minutes later. He sits down and examines the labora\u00ad tory test results, which have just come in. He has not examined the results before your appointment. He says that you don't have a strep infection. He then looks at the chest X-ray and looks again at the various laboratory results, including the results from the blood tests. [The following sentence is only in the no-aid sce\u00ad nario: He spends a minute or two mulling over this information.] [Additional text for aid scenario: He Downloaded from http://p'ldm.sagepub.com at BOSTON UNIV on June 17 2008 \u00a9 2007 Society for Medical Decision Making.

He also types in the information you provided yesterday concerning your coughing, earaches, etc. He explains that to help make the diagnosis, he is using a computer program {The following clause is inserted only in the prestigious-aid scenario: developed at the prestigious Mayo Clinic, one of the nation's premier medical facilities}, To run the program, he says, he merely types in the informa\u00ad tion you've provided. The computer program then assigns a likelihood to each of several possible diag\u00ad noses.

He tells you to continue to take the medication he prescribed yesterday, and in addition, he writes you a 2nd prescription for a cough suppressant. He tells you to come back in 5 days if there is no improve\u00ad ment. He says that you will not be entirely well for a couple of weeks; the cough will last quite a long time. REFERENCES 1.

We evaluated a patient navigator intervention among inner- city women with breast abnormalities. A full-time patient navigator supported patients using the care management model. Female patients 18 years and above,referred to an urban, hospital-based, diagnostic breast health practice from Janu-ary to June 2000 (preintervention) and November 2001 to February 2003 (inter-vention), were studied. Timely follow-up was defined as arrival to diagnosticevaluation within 120 days from the date the original appointment was sched-uled. Data were collected via computerized registration, medical records, andpatient interview. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were con- ducted, comparing preintervention and intervention groups, with propensity score analysis and time trend analysis to address the limitations of the pre-postdesign. 314 patients were scheduled preintervention; 1018, during the interven-tion. Overall, mean age was 44 no or onlypublic insurance. Forty-four percent of referrals originated from a communityhealth center, 34% from a hospital-based practice. During versus 64% preintervention ( P<.0001). In adjusted analy- ses, women in the intervention group had 39% greater odds of having timely fol- low-up (95% CI, 1.01-1.9). Timely follow-up in the adjusted model was associatedwith older age ( P\u00bc.0003), having private an abnor- mammogram ( P\u00bc.0001), and being referred from a hospital-based practice, as compared to a community health center ( P\u00bc.003).

Recent SEER statistics show that the proportion of women diagnosed with re- gional- and distant-stage breast cancer continues tobe higher among African Americans and Hispanicsthan among non-Hispanic whites. The same is truewhen one compares high- versus low-poverty censustracts; the proportion diagnosed with distant stagesis higher in high-poverty census tracts. 1 Improvements in access and equity in mammog- raphy screening alone have not translated into sur- vival improvements for these disadvantaged women.1 Although racial/ethnic differences in mammographyutilization rates have been found to explain some ofthe observed differences in stage at diagnosis, 2sev- eral observational studies have not found this to be asignificant explanatory factor. 3-5Potential reduction in morbidity and mortality through breast cancer screening will never be realized without timely and efficient follow-up care once an abnormality hasbeen detected. Investigating the disparities in follow-up after abnormal breast screening serves as the nextstep in addressing breast cancer health disparities.Although measures of follow-up lack precision, 6 numerous studies have documented that racial/eth-nic minority women often suffer from the longest delays at this point. 5,7-11 Patient navigation, a type of care management that encompasses a wide-range of advocacy and coor-dination activities, has been proposed to addressknown barriers to the delivery of high-quality cancercare in underserved populations. 12-14A recent national case study review of emerging programs to reduceracial/ethnic disparities in cancer found that almost all adopted a variant of patient navigation. 15Despite increasing interest along with both federal and privateresource allocation, 16,17published evidence of the ben- efit of navigation programs is limited.18 We evaluated a hospital-based patient navigator intervention among inner-city minority women withbreast abnormalities. The main objective of the inter-vention is to improve the rate of timely diagnostic follow-up in comparison to a group of historical con- trols, and to identify characteristics of patients whoare most at risk for loss to follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS This pre-post intervention study was conducted at ahospital-based diagnostic breast health practice at amajor academic medical center in Boston, Massa-chusetts. The specialty practice accepts referrals forevaluation of any breast health issue, includingscreening abnormalities, suspicious symptoms, orelevated cancer risk. Patients served include those who receive their primary care at the academic med- ical center and those from over 20 affiliated commu- nity health centers throughout Boston. Together withits affiliated health centers, the academic institutionserves as the major safety-net hospital in the region.All income eligible, uninsured women can receiveservices without charge. This study was approved byour Institutional Review Board. Written informedconsent was waived since the intervention was im- plemented as a new standard of care for all patients. The final dataset used in these analyses was devoidof all patient identifiers. Study Sample The sample for this study included all women with scheduled visits at the diagnostic breast health prac- tice from January through June 2000 (preinterven-tion, N\u00bc314) and November 2001 through February 2003 (intervention, N\u00bc1018). We included consecu- tive female patients >18 years referred for evaluation during the study period, as referral criteria to thepractice were consistent throughout this time period.Individual women were only included once through- out the study, so that preintervention and interven- tion subjects are unique women. For women seenmore than once during this timeframe, we evaluatedtheir initial scheduled visit only, using subsequentvisits for the sole purpose of evaluating follow-upwithin 120 days. Preintervention As a result of initial observations of patient care datashowing high rates of failure to arrive for scheduledevaluation, a formal program evaluation was con-ceived. At the time of preintervention data collection,the standard protocol for these patients used existingsecretarial staff to attempt telephone contact withoutclinical oversight. In the ensuing 16 months prior to program implementation, this protocol continued without other institutional or practice changes whilea needs assessment was undertaken to inform theintervention. Findings from structured interviewswith patients, breast health providers/support staff,and referring providers identified lack of coordina-tion of care and communication as major barriers todiagnostic evaluation. Program planning, hiring, and navigator training occurred during this time period. Intervention The patient navigator intervention was guided by the principles of Care Management.19Services provided by the navigator focused around 4 key activities: 1) case360 CANCER Supplement January 15, 2007 / Volume 109 / Number 2identification, 2) identification of individual barriers to care, 3) implementation of a care plan, and 4) tracking through completion. Criteria for hiring of the patient navigator included experience caring for a diversepatient population and knowl edge of the existing local health systems. The patient navigator was trained tocoordinate care for each patient referred for diagnosticevaluation. Training included written triage and follow-u pp r o t o c o l sa sw e l la sm o n t h l yb a r r i e r s - f o c u s e dc u l -tural competence training at the local department of public health. Initial contact with patients began after appointments were scheduled, 1 week before theirscheduled visit. Telephone outreach with all patients,using interpreters for non-English speaking women,was attempted to confirm appointments, provide infor-mation about the visit, and learn about any individualbarriers to arriving for that appointment. The navigatorutilized available resources to address those barriers. A key function of the navigator included advocating for the patient through rapid communication withbreast health providers, referring providers, and withother specialty sites, including radiology, surgery, andpathology. In accordance with the 4th key activity,the patient navigator, with daily assistance andweekly oversight by the study coordinator, trackedinformation on patient demographics, reason for referral, site and provider who referred the patient, diagnostic evaluation conducted, and outcomes ofevaluation. Dates from time of initial referral througharrival to first scheduled visit were collected. Data Collection Preintervention data collection was conducted via ret-rospective chart review for women referred to thediagnostic breast evaluation practice from Januarythrough June 2000. The administrative registrationdatabase was reviewed for the date that the first diag-nostic appointment was scheduled, demographic data,and the date at which the patient first arrived for eva-luation. If the patient's race was not listed in the regis- tration database, but their birthplace and native language were listed, race was extrapolated from birth-place and native language. For example, if a womanwas born in Haiti and spoke Haitian-Creole, she wascategorized as black. The clinical record wasabstracted for reason for visit based on the followingcategories: abnormal mammography (BI-RADS cate-gory 0, 3, 4, 5), abnormal clinical breast exam, or other (including suspicious symptoms or elevated cancer risk). To ensure accuracy of data, all preinterventiondata were reviewed by a second chart abstractor. Intervention data were collected prospectively by the navigator beginning 1 week before the sched-uled diagnostic visit at the time schedules werereviewed for case identification and telephone out- reach. Following preintervention data collection protocol, the administrative registration database was reviewed for the date that the diagnosticappointment was scheduled and demographic data while the clinical record was abstracted for reasonfor visit. The date the subjects first arrived to a diag-nostic evaluation was documented prospectively bythe navigator. To ensure completeness and accuracyof data, all intervention data were reviewed by a one of the authors on a weekly basis (TB, KF). The final analytic file was a limited dataset devoid of keypatient identifiers. The main outcome in this intervention study was the dichotomous variable timely follow-up (yes, no). Subjects were considered to have timely follow-up if they arrived to a diagnostic evaluation visitwithin 120 days from the date the original appoint- ment was scheduled. Although an ideal outcome would be time to actual diagnosis or resolution ofthe abnormality, limited data collected during thepreintervention period prohibited this comparison.Since no gold standard exists to determine what con-stitutes timely diagnostic follow-up, 6we operationa- lized the concept based on: 1) literature that suggestsdiagnostic and treatment delays of 3-6 months may impact survival 20; and 2) review of our data, which indicated that beyond 120 days no appreciable addi-tional follow-up was achieved. Furthermore, repeat-ing our analyses using 90 days as the definition oftimely follow-up did not change our findings. Todetermine 120 day follow-up rates for patients whowere seen within the last 120 days for the specifiedstudy time period, records beyond the study end date were examined. Statistical Analyses Baseline demographic data, including age, race, rea- son for consultation, site of referral, need for inter-preter services, and insurance status, were compared between subjects presenting for care during the pre- intervention and intervention period. Bivariate com-parisons using x 2tests of independence tested for differences in timely follow-up between the 2 groupsoverall, and within specific demographic variables.Logistic regression was conducted to assess the pro-portion of benefit that can be attributed to the navi-gator intervention, once demographic variables were taken into account, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. All analyses were done using PC-SAS version 8.02. 21 Because baseline differences were noted between the preintervention and intervention group, 2 subse-quent analyses were performed to control for differ-Breast Cancer Patient Navigation Intervention/Battaglia et al. 361ences in case-mix in the 2 study groups. First, a pro- pensity score analysis was conducted to adjust fordifferences between the study periods. This method-ology selects a random subset of subjects in eachstudy period, so that baseline characteristics of the2 groups are similar. One intervention subject waschosen per preintervention subject. After demon-strating that the groups were similar in the their baseline characteristics (age, race/ethnicity, insur- ance, reason for referral, and source of referral), weconducted a multiple logistic regression on thereduced dataset predicting timely follow-up, againadjusting for age, race/ethnicity, insurance, reasonfor referral, and referral source. Second, time wasconsidered as a covariate in the model to control forlongitudinal effects not related to the intervention. Time was calculated as the month of the study when the visit was scheduled. For example, a women whoscheduled her appointment during the first month ofthe study (January 2000) would have a value of timeof 1, while a women who was in the intervention pe-riod might have a value of time of 25, representingthat she scheduled her appointment in January 2002.Three models were considered: including time to the main model including covariates; including an inter-action effect between time and intervention in the main model; and considering only the effects of timeand intervention on timely follow-up. 22 RESULTS During the study period, 2044 scheduled patient visitswere identified, which corresponded to 1381 indivi-dual patients. Of those patients, 21 (1.5%) men wereexcluded, 10 (0.7%) visits for female teens under age18 were excluded, and 14 (1.0%) were excluded due to missing dates. The final analytic sample consisted of 1332 individual women with scheduled visits (314 pre-intervention, 1018 during the intervention period). Baseline characteristics by study group are shown in Table 1. The majority of women scheduledfor evaluation were under age 65 (91%), with overhalf (52%) between 40 and 64 years of age. The ma-jority of women were of minority race (40% black, 14% Hispanic, 4% Asian), while 36% were non-His- panic white. Fifteen percent required a language in-terpreter during their visit, and most (68%) had noi n s u r a n c eo rs o m et y p eo fp u b l i ch e a l t hi n s u r a n c e(Medicaid, Medicare only, or uncompensated carecoverage). Over half the women were referred forTABLE 1 Characteristics of Patients Before and After Patient Navigation Intervention Subject characteristic Total ( N\u00bc1332) (47) 373 (37) .0008 40-64 689 (52) 147 (47) 542 (53) /C2165 121 (9) 18 (6) 103 (10) Race White 480 (36) 107 (34) 373 (37) .03 Black 534 (40) 143 (46) 391 (38) Hispanic 190 (14) 44 (14) 146 (14)Asian 59 (4) 13 (4) 46 (5)Other 69 (5) 7 (2) 62 (6) Insurance Private 423 (32) 82 (26) 341 (34) .01Public/none 909 (68) 232 (74) 677 (67) Interpreter Needed 197 (15) 25 (8) 172 (17) <.0001 Reason for visit Breast mass 630 (47) 117 (37) 513 (50) <.0001 Abnormal mammogram 158 (12) 29 (9) 129 (13) Other 544 (41) 168 (54) 376 (37) Source of referral CHC 582 (44) 96 (31) 486 (48) <.0001 Hospital 448 (34) 78 (25) 370 (36) Private 105 (8) 13 (4) 92 (9)Unknown/other 197 (15) 127 (40) 70 (7) CHC indicates community health center.

Forty-onepercent of women in the ''other'' category whichincluded breast pain, increased breast cancer riskbased on family or personal history of breast cancer,or nipple discharge, respectively. The majority ofwomen were referred from a Community Health Center (CHC; 44%) or a hospital-based practice site (34%). Table 1 also demonstrates that subjects who pre- sented for evaluation during the intervention perioddiffered significantly from preintervention subjects inmost demographic characteristics. Intervention sub-jects were more likely to be older, white, to haveprivate health insurance coverage, to require an in- terpreter, to be referred for a screening abnormality and to have been referred from an affiliated CHC. Overall, 64% of subjects referred for diagnostic evaluation had timely follow-up during the preinter-vention period ( N\u00bc314) compared with 78% of women during intervention ( N\u00bc1018) (P<.0001, unadjusted OR: 2.0 [95% CI, 1.5-2.6]). Table 2 presents the results of our adjusted analysis. Controlling for age, race, insurance status, reason for referral, and source of referral, women in the inter-vention group had a 39% greater odds of havingtimely follow-up (OR \u00bc1.39 [95% CI, 1.01-1.91]). Compared with women aged 40-64, women over65 years of age were more likely to have timely fol-low-up (OR of 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.4), while those aged18-39 less have timely follow-up (ORof 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9). Women with private healthinsurance were more likely to have timely follow-up, compared with those with only public or no health insurance (OR of 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.1). Comparedwith women referred for evaluation of an abnormalscreening mammogram, timely follow-up was lesslikely among women referred for evaluation of abreast mass (OR of 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9) CI 0.2-0.5). Com-pared with women referred from community health centers, timely follow-up was more likely among those referred from hospital-based practice sites (ORof 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-2.0). Table 2 also shows the results of our propensity score analysis to address the differences in case-mix.Our propensity score analysis selected a subset of284 preintervention and 284 intervention subjectswith similar baseline characteristics, using the same 5 covariates as the main analytic model to calculate a propensity of being in the intervention group.Within each quintile of propensity score, an evenTABLE 2 Factors Associated With Timely Follow-Up by Logistic Regression and Propensity Score Analysis: Patient Navigation Intervention Variable Logistic Regression Odds Ratio* 95% CI Propensity Score Odds Ratio* 95% CI Patient navigation intervention 1.4 1.01-1.9 1.7 1.2-2.6 Age, y 18-39 0.7 0.5-0.9 0.4 0.3-0.640-64 1.0 xxx 1.0 xxx/C2165 1.9 1.1-3.4 2.3 0.8-6.4 Insurance Private (vs. public) 1.5 1.1-2.1 2.2 1.3-3.7 Race White 1.0 xxx 1.0 xxx Black 0.8 0.6-1.0 0.9 0.6-1.5 Hispanic 1.2 0.8-1.8 2.0 1.0-3.9Asian 1.5 0.7-3.0 2.1 0.6-7.8 Other 0.6 0.3-1.1 0.4 0.1-1.2 Reason for visit Breast mass 0.5 0.3-0.9 0.9 0.4-1.8Abnormal mammogram 1.0 xxx 1.0 xxx Other 0.3 0.2-0.5 0.6 0.3-1.1 Source of referral CHC 1.0 Xxx 1.0 xxxHospital 1.4 1.0-2.0 0.8 0.5-1.3 0.7 0.5-1.0 0.5 0.3-0.8 CHC indicates community health center. * Analyses adjusted for all variables listed in table.Breast Cancer Patient Navigation Intervention/Battaglia et al. 363number of preintervention and intervention women were chosen, so that the resulting subsample would be matched on baseline covariates. All covariates were associated with the intervention before sam-pling, while only source of referral remained asso-ciated with the intervention postsampling ( P-values were .79 for age, .34 for insurance, .41 for race, .0004for source, and .13 for source). Comparison of these2 matched subgroups did not change the directionor significance of the intervention effect. Using these reduced data, 65% of preintervention versus 76% of intervention subjects had timely follow-up ( P\u00bc.008). The odds ratio (OR) for the postsampling interventionwas 1.7 (95% CI, 1.2-2.6). The only difference notedin the propensity score analysis is a change in effectdue to source of referral, specifically from hospitalversus CHC, where the effect size changed directionfrom 1.4 to 0.8. These results can be found in Table 2. As a second sensitivity analysis, we considered the trend over time. Three models were consideredusing the time variable. We first added time to thefinal multiple logistic regression reported in Table 2.In this model, controlling for other covariates, timewas not significant ( P\u00bc.57). Second, a time-inter- vention interaction was considered. Once again, thisterm was not significant ( P\u00bc.41). Lastly, in recogni- tion of the fact that the effect of the time variable might be confounded within the other covariates,which have changed over time, a model includingonly time and intervention was evaluated to predicttimely follow-up. In this model, once again, the trendover time being associated with timely follow-up wasnot significant ( P\u00bc.34). These results lead us to conclude that any change over time has been suc- cessfully addressed by the modeling on the other covariates. DISCUSSION Patient, provider, cultural, and system level factorshave been identified as barriers to the provision of effective cancer diagnostic and treatment services in an equitable and timely manner, 23-37thus leading to health disparities.38This is the first publication, to our knowledge, to provide evaluation of a barrier-focused, patient navigation program within an aca-demic medical center, using outcomes data on thegroup of patients receiving service for breast screen-ing abnormalities. Our data suggest that patient navi- gation improved rates of timely diagnostic follow-up for abnormal breast cancer screening among aracially diverse group of urban women. We deter-mined that nearly all subgroups of women benefitedfrom the intervention even after adjusting for selec-tion bias. The vast majority of our study populationwere women from either an ethnic minority popula- tion, and/or from a low income group, thus repre- senting the women at greatest risk of poor outcomes from cancer. Our navigation intervention is modeled after the care management model, with 4 key components tonavigation. 19These include a mechanism for case identification, a process of identifying barriers to fol-low-up for each individual case, a plan for addressingbarriers, and a system of tracking. Each of these components is critical to both accomplish effective navigation, but also to track the outcomes of indivi-dual women included in our system. Our system uti-lized hand entered systems for all aspects of careand tracking, thus demonstrating a method which iseasily generalizable to many systems that care forunderserved and minority populations. Care management, used in nursing and social work since the mid 1800s, has been employed forthose at increased risk for adverse outcomes and ex- cessive healthcare utilization. 39The concept has evolved over the years to target various chronic dis-eases, most notably diabetes, 40where evidence has led to clinical recommendations for such interven- tions by medical organizations. There has been grow- ing interest in the use of patient navigators as amechanism to reduce cancer disparities through care management since the concept was first introduced in the early 1990s. 18Since then, navigator programs have been implemented across the country with sup- port from private foundations13and more recently the federal government16,41after 2 bills in Congress42,43 proposed support for navigation programs to address cancer disparity in underserved populations. To date, however, the data on the effectiveness of patient navi-gation interventions has been anecdotal or uncon- trolled. 18Although evidence does exist to demonstrate the effectiveness of individual components of ourmodel, such as telephone outreach or tracking, 44-46 intervention studies to improve diagnostic follow-up using patient navigation encompassing the full care management model only exist for women with abnor-mal Papanicolaou (Pap) tests. 47,48This marks the first report of an evaluation to investigate the benefit of a patient navigator in an academic medical center ser-ving an urban, minority patient population with screening breast abnormalities. We evaluated timely follow-up , defined as the time from when the first diagnostic breast appoint- ment is scheduled until actual follow-up evaluation was initiated, in a racially diverse group of inner-citywomen referred for diagnostic breast evaluation atan urban academic medical center. Our study didnot permit an evaluation of timeliness to actual diag-364 CANCER Supplement January 15, 2007 / Volume 109 / Number 2nosis. Rather, the intermediate outcome of time to initiation of diagnostic evaluation was chosen based on the limited data collected in the preintervention period. Currently, there lacks clear and widelyaccepted definitions of what constitutes timely follow-up after a breast abnormality is detected, 6which lim- its our ability to compare our findings with existingliterature. We demonstrated a 15% improvement intimely follow-up after program implementation. Thisincrease is consistent with a previously published report of a similar care management intervention for inner-city minority women with abnormal Pap tests. 48 We identified characteristics of those patients who are most at risk for loss to follow-up. Significantpredictors of timely follow-up include older age,having a referral, which originated on-site, havingprivate health insurance, or being referred for eva-luation of an abnormal screening mammogram. Women referred from community health centers benefited from the intervention, but not to the samedegree as other women. Although transportation orconvenience factors could have been operant, oursystem of care provides regularly scheduled shuttlerides to and from all our affiliated health centers.Rather, the etiology may lie in other patient charac-teristics not measured in our study, such as fear, mistrust, lack of appreciation of the potential seri- ousness of the problem, inability to get time off fromwork, child care issues, etc. Our model employed a medical assistant with some clinical experience recruited to the navigatorposition. Although no standard guidelines exist,patient navigation typically utilizes a person who isnot the provider of direct healthcare for coordina- tion and implementing care. The literature to date has described navigation across a broad spectrumof experience, including trained lay navigators, tothose with advance nursing degrees. 12Lack of clarity exists for what constitutes patient navigation,as it has multiple components, although a severalstudies sought to evaluate programs with somecomponents of patient navigation. 46,47Our data cannot address which level of training is most effec- tive or most cost effective or which components ofnavigation are critical to successful outcomes. Ourdata precluded an analysis of the specific interven-tion components. Future studies should focus ondeveloping measurements of the 4 principles of caremanagement utilized in this study to determinewhich components have the greatest impact on tar- get populations. Limitations of our study include the evaluation of the intervention in only one health care system.However, the study had a large sample size and adiverse population referred from multiple sites. Nonetheless, our system has some unique features that may encompass a more responsive system of care for underserved urban communities, limitinggeneralizability to other health care systems, evenwith similar underserved communities. Unique fea-tures include a managed Medicaid plan, whichcovers the greater proportion of the otherwise un-insured, and an uncompensated care pool, to sup-port those without any health insurance access otherwise. Furthermore, extensive interpreter services and transportation strategies are in place to allowpatients to travel easily from community health cen-ters to the medical center. Another limitation of this study is the pre-post design, which is vulnerable to secular trends as theexplanation of the findings. Although our pre-postdesign introduces the possibility of historical bias, the above-mentioned resources were in place thro- ughout the study duration. Furthermore, there wereno major institutional, city- or statewide breast can-cer diagnostic programs implemented during thestudy period to introduce secular trends as a poten-tial explanation for our findings. A propensity scoreanalysis to adjust for known baseline differences inthe 2 groups found the same magnitude of effect of the intervention. A time trend analysis was also con- ducted and identified no significant time trend. Forthese reasons, it is less likely that the observed differ-ences in case-mix in the 2 study periods are attribut-able to changes in the healthcare system that arebeing confused with a navigator effect. Our data suggest a benefit of patient navigators for addressing follow-up after abnormal cancer screen- ing. Patient navigation shows promise as the missing link between available cancer care services and de-livery to vulnerable populations. Future funding ofpatient navigation is critical to continue more rigor-ous evaluation efforts, especially to address whichtype of navigator and what components of naviga-tion are most effective. Furthermore, understandingthe work design issues and how to coordinate patient navigator efforts across specialists and disease condi- tions is especially timely, as multiple venues of thehealth care system begin to employ navigators. Thesedata will be critical in policy decisions on incorporat-ing support through insurers to accomplish cancercare management for vulnerable populations. REFERENCES 1.

Freund, M.D., M.P.H. Boston and Bedford, Mass.Background: Prior research on decision-making for reconstructive surgery after mastectomy has not addressed the specific considerations of sexual minoritywomen (women who partner with women, and lesbian or bisexual identifiedwomen). The purpose of this study is to explore which issues sexual minoritywomen considered when making decisions on reconstructive surgery and tounderstand the influence and perspectives of these women's most importantsupport persons.Methods: Study participants were recruited through targeted community-based sampling. The authors conducted individual semistructured interviews with 15sexual minority women who had been treated with mastectomy after breastcancer diagnosis and 12 support persons who were identified by these womenas their most important source of support. Using qualitative data analysis soft-ware, transcribed interviews were analyzed. Through constant comparison meth-ods, themes related to the decision on and experiences and satisfaction withreconstructive choice were identified from the narrative data.Results: The considerations of women who decided for or against reconstruc- tion are rooted in a value system and body image shaped by their sexual minorityidentity. Women who chose reconstruction experienced difficulties and regrets,whereas women without reconstruction adjusted well after time. Partners ofsexual minority women matched the level of satisfaction with reconstructivechoice achieved by the women themselves.Conclusion: Providers who treat sexual minority women might benefit from knowing about issues important to this population to provide more compre-hensive care. ( Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 119: 464, 2007.) The majority of women treated with mastec- tomy after breast cancer diagnosis forego re-constructive surgery. 1,2There is inconsistent evidence that benefits are derived from undergo-ing reconstruction. 3-7Determining what influ- ences patients to elect reconstruction has been thefocus of a number of studies. 8-14Women's deci-sion-making on reconstruction is still not entirely understood, but intrapersonal and interpersonalfactors such as body image, self-concept, total self-image, and women's partner relationship havebeen identified as influences on women's recon-structive choices. 7,14,15Women who chose breast reconstruction reported wanting to get rid of abreast prosthesis, freedom to wear different typesof clothing, regaining their femininity, and a desireto feel whole again, whereas women with breastprostheses reported reconstruction not to be es-sential for their physical or emotional well-being,not wanting a foreign object in their body. 13Al- though women weighed these issues when decid-ing on reconstructive surgery, studies also con-cluded that the two groups of women do notsignificantly differ regarding body image or posi-tive self-concept. 3,8,9However, body image is a mul- tidimensional concept and has been defined dif-ferently by researchers. 16The complexity of this construct continues to generate hypotheses to ex-From the Department of Health Services, Boston University School of Public Health; Center for Health Quality, Out-comes, and Economic Research; Fenway Institute, FenwayCommunity Health; and Women's Health Unit, Evans De-partment of Medicine and Women's Health InterdisciplinaryResearch Center, Boston University School of Medicine.Received for publication June 15, 2005; accepted August 24,2005.The views expressed in this article are those of the authors anddo not necessarily represent the views of the MassachusettsDepartment of Public Health, the American Cancer Society,or the Department of Veterans Affairs.Copyright \u00a92007 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons DOI: 10.1097/01.prs.0000246402.79334.3b www.PRSJournal.com 464plain the rejection of reconstruction. These in- clude the following: women who make this choicehave a more resilient body image, are less investedin their physical appearance, or are in more denialabout their body image; however, the empiricalevidence for these hypotheses is mostly lacking. 7 Reconstructive surgery or the desire for recon- struction has also been linked to demographiccharacteristics, in that older and poorer womenundergo significantly fewer reconstructions, 1,15 and African American and Asian women un-dergo reconstructive surgery less often thanwhite women. 17We are not aware of any study considering the influence of sexual orientationon electing reconstructive surgery, although onestudy of breast cancer patients found that lesbi-ans have a better body image compared withheterosexual patients. 18The evidence is incon- sistent that women's body image, self-concept,and perceptions of attractiveness differ by sexualorientation in the general population. 19-21To date, a prevailing heterosexual framework instudies on reconstructive surgery consideredonly women's male partners' perceptions of re-construction, whereas sexual minority women'spartners or social support persons have beenneglected. Surgeons would benefit from under-standing factors that lead to surgical decisions sothat patients can be appropriately counseled andreconstruction options discussed. Body image iscentral for decisions on this surgical choice, 22 and we hypothesize that sexual minority womenconsider different dimensions of body image inmaking decisions about reconstruction. If this istrue, knowledge of sexual orientation as part ofthe medical history may benefit surgeons andpatients in their discussion of management op-tions. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective qualitative study of sexual minority women with breast cancer andtheir support persons. Qualitative methods areuniquely suited to this type of exploratory inquiry,especially where traditional pencil and paper sur-veys have not been tested or validated in theunique population in question. 20We relied on community-based purposive sampling, which hasbeen widely used to overcome the challenges ofrecruiting members of vulnerable or \"hidden\"populations into research studies, 23,24and is well- suited for a comprehensive exploration of sexualminority women's experiences with breast cancer.Recruitment has been further enhanced throughthe use of snowball sampling, where participantsare asked to refer others who may be willing to participate in the study. We obtained institutional human subjects ap- proval for this study. Participants received $20 fortheir participation. After consent was obtained, weconducted one tape-recorded, in-depth, semi-structured interview that lasted on average 90 min-utes. The narrative interviews were conducted toinvestigate the following broad domains: diagno-sis, treatment course, treatment decision-making,sources of social support, and adjustment. Weasked women to identify their \"trusted other,\"which we defined as their most important supportperson with respect to their cancer care, someoneother than their treating physician. 25Having a support person was not required for study entry,and the gender and sexual orientation of the sup-port person was unrestricted. We contacted thesupport person, obtained consent, and conducteda narrative interview that covered the same do-mains as the interview with the women themselves,to elicit the support person's perspective and levelof involvement. We also collected demographicand cancer-related information (stage and date ofdiagnosis) on participants through a self-admin-istered questionnaire. Women with breast cancer were eligible for this study if they met the following eligibility cri-teria: (1) sexual minority status, (2) a diagnosis ofnonrecurrent and nonmetastatic breast cancer,(3) having completed invasive treatment (surgery,radiation, chemotherapy) for breast cancer withinthe past 5 years, and (4) English proficiency. Wedefined sexual minority status as stating a lesbianor bisexual identity. We included women who re-ported partnering with women in an attempt to beinclusive of women who might feel uncomfortableembracing a lesbian or bisexual identity. Womenwho were currently using hormonal treatment,such as tamoxifen, were included in this study. Measures History of the disease and treatment were de- rived from both the questionnaire and interviews.The questionnaire inquired about the demo-graphics of participants. Race was categorized intowhite, African American, Hispanic, Asian, Amer-ican Indian, mixed race, or other. Income wasdetermined by providing respondents with the fol-lowing ranges: less than $10,000 incre-ments to $99,999, $100,000. Other ques-tions assessed age, education, health insurance,and employment. In the absence of an agreed-onstandardized measure of sexual orientation, 26weVolume 119, Number 2 Decisions of Sexual Minority Women 465defined our population using two of three dimen- sions (identity and behavior, but not desire) ofsexual orientation. Respondents were asked to re-port the sexual identity or the relationship behav-ior that best described them, allowing for the fol-lowing responses: lesbian, bisexual, partner withwomen, heterosexual, or other. Disclosure to oth-ers in their social network was assessed by askingparticipants to report whether sexual orientationwas disclosed (1), disclosed and openly talkedabout (2), or not disclosed (0) to each of thefollowing 12 person groups: children, grandchil-dren, nieces and nephews, parents, grandparents,siblings other blood relatives, heterosexualfriends, colleagues at work, one's boss, neighbors,or heterosexuals in general. The possible range onthis disclosure scale was 0 to 24, whereby higherscores indicated a greater level of disclosure. Analysis Summary statistics, including means or per- centage distribution, were calculated to describeparticipants' demographic and medical character-istics (Tables 1 and 2). The audio-recorded inter-view data were transcribed verbatim and then an-alyzed according to grounded theory methods ofqualitative analysis. 27Grounded theory methodol- ogy offers a comprehensive and systematic frame-work for developing a theory of understandingabout participants' experiences that is iterativelyassessed from the narrative data. The analysis sum-marized in this article focused on participants'decisions and thoughts about reconstructive sur-gery. Passages referring to mastectomy and recon-structive surgery were marked and identified bydescriptive code words. Two of the authors (U.B.and R.L.) developed the codes based on indepen-dent coding of a subset of five interviews withwomen with breast cancer and a subset of fiveinterviews with support persons. Once agreementon the codes and reliability of coding was ensured, all remaining interviews were coded. RESULTS Of the 15 sexual minority women treated with mastectomy, eight chose reconstructive surgeryand seven decided against it. Mastectomy was therecommended surgical treatment for some, otherschose mastectomy to avoid radiation, and approx-imately half initially underwent breast-conservingsurgery or even repeated lumpectomies beforemastectomy. The women who did and who did not undergo reconstruction were similar with respect to cancerstage, receipt of adjuvant therapy, and time sincediagnosis (Table 1). Four of the seven women whodecided against reconstruction each identifiedone support person, whereas three women did notidentify such a person. Six of the eight women whochose reconstruction identified one support per-son, and one identified two. All support personswere female. The four support persons in the no-reconstruction group were these women's part-ners. The eight support persons in the reconstruc-tion group were five partners and the mother,sister, and friend of women with breast cancer.Comparisons of demographic characteristics in-dicated that women in the two reconstructiongroups were similar, as were the two groups ofsupport persons (Table 2). Certain themes were considerations for all women regardless of the choice they made. Breastsize was one such recurrent theme when womenconsidered reconstruction. Although breast sizeentered into women's decision-making, their ac-tual breast size was not an absolute determinant ofa particular choice. However, women with smallbreasts felt comfortable rejecting reconstruction,arguing that it would not make much of a visibledifference in their appearance. Large-breastedwomen struggled with the implications of a mas- Table 1.

The importance of their breast for their self- image was another issue that was mentioned bywomen who did and did not elect reconstructivesurgery. The notion of not being defined by hav-ing breasts was closely aligned with a sexual mi-nority (i.e., lesbian identity). Body strength andphysical functioning were more important con-siderations than aesthetic considerations in thoseinterviewed. In the context of women's commu-nications with breast cancer care providers andplastic surgeons, in particular, they noted their\"otherness\"\u2014the discrepancy of their values andbody image with those of mainstream society, asdemonstrated by the following quote by onewoman who decided for reconstruction: It wasn't that he [plastic surgeon] was\u2014it had to dowith me being a lesbian, it was that lesbians some-times have different views about body image that aredifferent from\u2014what do you call it?\u2014straightworld. They have different\u2014it's a wider\u2014we have awider range of \u2014I don't know what the\u2014how todescribe it. Similarly, another woman who decided against reconstruction described her displeasure with theinformation she received on reconstruction. Al- though she was concerned with the implicationson her physical functioning, reconstruction's cos-metic advantages were emphasized: The whole decision about reconstruction or not wassuch a weird experience for me, because when Iwould go in and talk with the physicians\u2014with thesurgeon\u2014the plastic surgeons\u2014about reconstruc-tion, they'd be talking about, like, all these thingsthat didn't make any sense to me. They were talkingabout what it looked like, they were talking aboutdroop, want to make sure that your droop is justright, and if we do this\u2014it's, like, I don't care aboutdroop. Tell me about how it affects my body. Like,am I going to be\u2014What can and can't I do? Will Ibe able to move\u2014and I was asking about sort of howit would limit my ability to do whatever I wanted todo, whether it was skiing or golf or, you know,running around\u2014and they were talking about thecosmetic side of it. It's like, I don't care about thecosmetic side. It's not important to me. And theycouldn't, like, get beyond that. And I realized that Ididn't need to talk to them, because I didn't needreconstruction because I didn't care about that. Regardless of their surgical choice, both groups of women perceived their values with re-spect to body image as different and rooted intheir sexual minority identity. Women who de-Table 2.

To present the mean income as a dollar amount, we used $20,000 as the minimum, $100,000 as the maximum, and the midpoint of each income range (e.g., $35,000).The possible range of disclosure was 0 to 24, whereby 0 indicates no disclosure to any of 12 (e.g., family, friends) person groups and 24 indicatescomplete disclosure, in that the sexual orientation is talked about with all 12 person groups.Volume 119, Number 2 Decisions of Sexual Minority Women 467cided against reconstruction emphasized strength, long-term health, and survival, ratherthan fitting a stereotypical beauty ideal. At times,this group of women portrayed reconstructive sur-gery as a \"straight woman's\" choice, emphasizingthat the procedure is unnecessary in that it doesnot provide for any curative benefit and requiresadditional operations and, in the case of the trans-verse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flapprocedure, compromising \"healthy\" body parts. It is of note that among the women who de- cided for reconstruction, a similar value systemand body image prevailed. One way in whichwomen from the reconstructive surgery group ex- pressed this was in their choice of reconstructiveprocedure. Avoidance of interfering with healthybody parts was generally the reason for choosingthe expander and implant procedure over thetransverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneousflap procedure: ...there were either two kinds of reconstruction sur- gery that can be done; one is put in the expander theother one is transflap when they use some tissue fromthe stomach or your back. And that I knew I defi-nitely did not want to do. I didn't want to mess upother parts of my body that were basically okay. So Idecided to do the tissue expander and have animplant put in. The decision on nipple reconstruction also shows these women's body image values. Severalwomen declined to complete their reconstructivesurgery process by foregoing nipple reconstruc-tion, reasoning that it had merely cosmetic value. I decided not to do the\u2014You know, you can do asame way, they can put the nipple in and then theydo a\u2014I was going to say branding. That's not whatI mean. Anyway, it doesn't really matter. And I justfigured, \"If they're not going to act like nipples, thenI do I need them for?\" So I didn't needthem. Some themes were linked to a particular re- constructive choice. One such theme, linked tothe rejection of reconstruction, was having seenanother woman's breast reconstruction and dis-liking the appearance. Other themes, linked tochoosing reconstruction, were avoiding depres-sion, regaining a \"normal\" appearance, and cov-ering up the physical effects of cancer: I was very, very 50-50 for a long time, even aftertalking with him [plastic surgeon] about whether Iwould go one-breasted, or have reconstruction. AndI decided to go with the reconstruction, because sortof like for the same reasons I went ahead and got a wig before I knew whether I was going to lose my hairor not, because I wanted the freedom of being able topass if I needed to; of being able to be in public, andnot be a cancer person\u2014you know, a cancer patient. Partners to women without reconstruction were in agreement with the body image and valuesystem that motivated this choice. Women whodecided against reconstruction declared withgreat confidence that a female partner is differentfrom a husband, in that her partner agrees withher, or that the decision was made jointly, and thatshe is as attractive to and desired by her partner asbefore. Their partners confirmed these state-ments, as in the following example: ...she didn't want to do reconstruction. We sort of agonized through that one, too, but the optionsweren't really realistic for her. She didn't want to doany kind of artificial implant. And they really didn'trecommend that anyway for someone her size. And itwould have been where they take the flesh from thestomach or the abdomen or the back, and either oneprobably would have been incapacitating to her inthe future for her work. ...And she wasn't so tied up in her looks that that mattered. And that didn'tmatter to me either. This type of joint decision-making and the concordance in values and body image in couplesdid not exist to the same extent in couples thatchose reconstruction. Partners to women with re-construction were more passive in the decision-making process and couples displayed at timesdiscordance in values and body image, as in thefollowing example: I wanted her to do exactly what she wanted to do.But deep inside, I was really wanting her to get abilateral mastectomy without reconstruction. ... Well, she pretty much right from the beginning wasvery on the track of she wanted complete reconstruc-tion, because I did at one point try to say, \"Youknow, don't do it right off. See how you feel about it.Leave it the way it is. It's one surgery. And then youdon't have to go back for the second surgery.\" But shereally wanted the reconstruction. Women who were without a partner at the time of decision-making on breast reconstructionincluded in their considerations how their choicewould affect their dating and a potential partner.Although being single does not automatically de-termine reconstruction as the choice, singlewomen who chose it often reasoned that theircurrent relationship status influenced theirchoice. One woman explained, \"I'm glad that IPlastic and Reconstructive Surgery February 2007 468decided to have reconstructive surgery. I think that's a choice that every woman has to make, butsince I'm a single woman, I felt more completewith two breasts.\" The support persons who were not in a partner relationship reported more reluctance to expresstheir reconstructive preferences. One supportperson explained to the interviewer that she per-sonally was opposed to reconstruction yet was un-certain whether she ever shared her opinion withher friend. Women who underwent reconstructive sur- gery reported considerable discomfort with thereconstruction procedure. Physical problems in-cluded numbness and limited range of motion.Because of complications, one woman had theexpander removed and another woman decidedto reverse her reconstruction permanently. Otherwomen expressed doubts or regrets about theirchoice and lack of information about potentialcomplications: This reconstruction, the transflap and that flap, it'shard to know. I mean, I'm all\u2014I've got scars here,I've got sort of\u2014I have scar tissue here or something,is numb in places. This is more problematic for me,this one, where they took the latissimus dorsi andlifted around. I've got tissue that's stuck to my ribsand so it's uncomfortable. You know. And I don'tknow\u2014I think sometimes\u2014like I think if somebodysaid to me .... You know, if I had to do it over again, I don't know what I would choose. The cosmetic outcome was satisfying to some women and unsatisfying to others, yet their body image was changed: The cosmetic result I am pleased with. When theyfirst did the surgery, I looked and I cried. That wasafter the mastectomy. There was like a little breastbud there because they had put in the beginningexpander and I wasn't sure how it was going to turnout. When they finally did the reconstruction, itdidn't look as I expected it was going to. And I hadheard from people that it usually takes some time tosettle in and looks better. But I cried a couple of timesjust because of the change and ...it didn't look like the other breast that remained. And now it lookspretty close. But I think that the change in the bodyimage, the way I talk about it is it's kind of like whenyou get a new car. And everything is fine before ithas any little dents. Then it gets a small dent. Andnow I have a big dent. Partners to women with reconstruction gen- erally echoed the sentiments, including thedoubts and misgivings about reconstruction. Non-partner support persons were not informed about the minute details of how women experiencedtheir reconstructed breast. The partner to awoman who was dissatisfied with the outcome,completely shared the dissatisfaction: ...she's having difficulty with because she doesn't like the outcome of the surgery and she doesn't likehow they look or how they feel and they're very hardand they feel like a wall and that's because theimplants are underneath the pecs, so when she con-tracts her pecs, that's all you see is movement of pecs.It's not like breast tissue. And she has a lot of sensoryloss, and they're not even, and they're lumpy, andthey feel, you know, lumpy, and they feel kind of likea very thick like bag inside of skin. You can feel likethis ripple. So it's just like there is nothing sensualabout them. There's nothing that makes me want totouch them, you know. And plus her reactions to itare so like it's almost like she freezes. Partners confirmed that outcomes of recon- struction or what to expect had not been thor-oughly explained by the plastic surgeon to thecouple; rather, they were sold on positives they didnot experience. Women without reconstructionplace less emphasis on physical problems. Physicalproblems they mentioned consisted of limitedrange of motion and having loss of sensationcaused by nerve damage. Adjusting to theirchanged body image required some time, and some commented on mastectomy being a barbaricprocedure. Their changed body shape causedsome to make adjustments either initially or per-manently. Adjustments consisted of wearing a braby women who were not used to wearing one be-fore and making decisions about when to use pros-theses. Depending on where women were in theiradjustment process, women expressed differentlevels of comfort with their changed body: ...originally I thought I'd have to go find another job, and I went and got a\u2014you know, spent $400on this prosthetic, which when I wear it, I look fine.And I always hated wearing bras; I always\u2014youknow, I was never in love with my breast. I love otherwomen's breasts, but I started\u2014early on, I wouldwear the prosthetic when I was going out in public.I never wear it now at all. And it's like last May Iwas going to visit my sister, who I hadn't seen forfive years, and she lives up in [U.S. state], and hasa kid, and a new husband, and I debated about,well, should I take it and wear it? And I said\u2014andmy friends said ...do what makes you feel comfort- able\u2014again, all this incredible support. And I real-ized that I don't need to wear this for someone else.Volume 119, Number 2 Decisions of Sexual Minority Women 469Women who decided against reconstruction commented on how they transformed theirchanged body shape into something positive forthem. Women commented on loving their mas-tectomy scar and on experiencing the sensitivitythey used to experience in their breast now in theirscar: I don't even think of it now that I don't have breasts.It took me about a year, though, to kind of get usedto that different body image, but I literally was soexcited to not have them. I mean it sounds crazy. Mychest looks like the nine-year-old boy I always wishedI could have been, and so from that aspect it'sabsolutely satisfying to me that I don't. I just hardlyeven think about it anymore. Contrary to women who chose reconstruction, women voiced no doubts or regrets about theirchoice. Partners of women without reconstructionechoed the level of satisfaction that the womenthemselves achieved with respect to their bodyimage, just as the partners in the reconstructiongroup echoed the level of dissatisfaction. No-re-construction partners commented on adjustmentssuch as wearing bras and prostheses. One partnerof a woman who adjusted well to her changedbody, mirrored her satisfaction: I love her. The breast not being there is just asbeautiful as it was when the breast was there .... No, it hasn't changed anything as far as us making lovetogether, being loving. No. I think she's as beautifulas she's ever been and in fact maybe more beautiful.She just gets better looking with age. DISCUSSION This is the first study we are aware of that focuses on sexual minority women's preferenceswith respect to reconstructive surgery. Our studypoints to sexual minority women's value systemsand body images that prioritize a sense of well-being including body strength, survival, and phys-ical functioning over outward appearance or nor-mative beauty standards. Body image is aninconsistently defined term, 16yet studies that mea- sure cancer-related body image prioritize cosmeticoutcomes and physical appearance, 16,28,29with few exceptions,18,30and essentially neglect the func- tional values sexual minority women described asmost pertinent. Sexual minority women who decided against reconstruction did not feel it was necessary fortheir well-being, whereas those who chose recon-struction hoped it would prevent depression trig-gered by mastectomy. Both those with and thosewithout reconstructive surgery applied their val- ues and a body image that prioritizes well-beingover external appearance. This confirms some re-search on sexual orientation and body image thatsuggests sexual minority women place less empha-sis on external appearance compared with het-erosexual women, sometimes described as sexualminority women's resistance to the dominant so-cietal beauty ideals. 20,21 Women in our study who underwent recon- struction reported discomfort, regrets, doubts,and discontentment with reconstruction, whereaswomen without reconstruction seemed more sat-isfied with their choice and outcome. One possibleinterpretation is that those choosing reconstruc-tion had expectations that reconstruction wouldconceal having had breast cancer and that they didnot achieve this expectation. This finding and in-terpretation concur with the results of presumedheterosexual women without reconstruction whorated their satisfaction higher than women withreconstruction, 31possibly indicating that women may use different criteria on which to base theirsatisfaction rating. It has been suggested thatwomen with mastectomy alone may be satisfiedbecause they achieved their goal of removing thecancer, whereas women with reconstruction mayrate their satisfaction lower because they had toundergo multiple operations. 31In our earlier as- sessment of a larger cohort of sexual minoritywomen, we did not find differences in coping andadjustment by reconstructive choice, 32yet we did not assess body image or satisfaction with the de-cision in these two reconstructive groups. Our study contributes new understandings about the perspective and influences of supportpersons on sexual minority women's decision-making. Partners shared in decision-making ofwomen with breast cancer and played an impor-tant role in supporting the decision made by theirpartners. Women with breast cancer had greatconfidence that their partner would love themregardless of their physical appearance after mas-tectomy. There are several limitations of this study. We relied on a small convenience sample of sexual mi-nority women and their support persons recruitedfrom the community. The sampling procedure andthe sample size limit us in several ways. First, we donot suggest making inferences from this study aboutthe prevalence of reconstruction in sexual minoritywomen. Second, we are presenting themes and con-cerns that entered into the decision-making processon reconstruction and that are connected to theperception and satisfaction with reconstructionPlastic and Reconstructive Surgery February 2007 470choices, yet we do not propose assumptions about the prevalence of the themes in this particular pop-ulation. Third, we are aware that our retrospectivedesign is subject to recall bias, which has been acritique of other studies that evaluated satisfactionwith reconstruction. 3,31 Nevertheless, these findings have implications for the discussion about reconstruction optionswith patients. Consistent with the literature indi-cating that positive patient-provider communica-tion improves outcomes, 29,33-35we propose that plastic surgeons inquire about patients' values andimportant issues with respect to body image. Re-constructive procedures should be presentedcomprehensively and clearly to indicate to whatdegree different procedures will match a patient'sexpectations. Our earlier research indicated thatbreast cancer providers should inquire about thesexual orientation of their patients rather thanassume all patients are heterosexual. 36Including partners or other support persons in the decision-making discussion may greatly benefit the patient.Also, the concerns, processes, and experiences de-scribed by the participants of this study can informsexual minority patients who are facing this sur-gical decision in the future.

ABSTRACT PURPOSE: Recent clinical trials have evaluated treatment strategies for chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in patients co-infected with human immunodeciency virus (HIV). Our objective was touse these data to examine the cost-effectiveness of treating HCV in an urban cohort of co-infected patients.METHODS: A computer-based model, together with available published data, was used to estimate lifetime costs (2004 US dollars), life expectancy, and incremental cost per year of life saved (YLS)associated with 3 treatment strategies: population patients,based on an actual urban cohort of HIV-HCV co-infected subjects, with a mean age of 44 years, of whom66% had genotype 1 HCV, 16% and ribavirin was consistently more effective and cost-effective than other treatment strategies, particularly in patients with non-genotype 1 HCV. For patients with CD4 countsbetween 200 and 500 cells/mm 3, survival benets ranged from 5 to 11 months, and incremental cost- effectiveness ratios were consistently less than $75,000 per YLS for men and women of both genotypes.Due to better treatment efcacy in non-genotype 1 HCV patients, this group experienced greater lifeexpectancy gains and lower incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with pegylated interferon-alfa and ribavirin for HCV in eligible co-infected patients with stable HIV disease provides substantial life-expectancy benets and appears to becost-effective. Overcoming barriers to HCV treatment eligibility among urban co-infected patients remainsa critical priority. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Kuehneet al demonstrated that combination therapy for histolog-ically moderate HCV in co-infected patients resulted inan increase in quality-adjusted life expectancy whileincurring costs comparable with other well-accepted clin-ical interventions. 16However, this analysis was per- formed before randomized controlled trials had estab-lished approximate treatment efcacy rates in HIV-HCVco-infected patients, and the APRICOT trial rates of sus-tained virologic response were generally lower than thelower bounds of the sensitivity analysis performed byKuehne and colleagues. Since this prior cost-effective-ness analysis was conducted, considerable progress hasbeen made in discerning treatment efcacy rates andrelative risk estimates for progression of liver disease inHIV-HCV co-infected patients. Our objective was to use recent prospective data regard- ing eligibility for interferon-based treatment, the impact ofHIV on the progression of HCV-related liver disease, anddemonstrated treatment efcacy from clinical trials to con-sider the potential health benets, economic costs, and cost-effectiveness of treatment for HCV among an urban cohortof co-infected patients with stable HIV disease. METHODS Overview We modied an existing Markov model of HCV17to reflect co-infection with HIV and examined the cost-effectivenessof the following strategies for HCV treatment in the treat- ment-eligible segment of an urban co-infected cohort18: combination interferon-alfa-2a and combi-nation therapy interferon-alfa-2a characteristics (mean age, Metavir score distribution, andmean CD4 cell count) for the mod-eled cohort were derived from asubgroup of the Hepatitis and AIDSLiver Outcomes (HALO) Study co-hort that was co-infected with HIVand HCV, and eligible for treatment (Table 1 ). 18 We followed the recommenda- tions of the US Panel on Cost-Effec- tiveness in Health and Medicine,19adopting a societal perspective (although we excluded patient time costs) and discounting all costs and clinical consequences at a rate of 3% per year. Thecomparative efciencies of alternative treatment strategieswere measured by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio,dened as the additional cost of a specic treatment strategydivided by its additional health benet, expressed here asCLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE In patients infected with both HIV and HCV, therapy with pegylated interferon-alfa and ribavirin for HCV increaseslife-expectancy and appears to becost-effective.

Analyses are stratied on HCV genotype (ie, 1 versus non-1),which affects response to therapy, and sex, which affects rate ofbrosis progression. Metavir scores were available for 32 subjects. Percentages add to more than 100 due to rounding.273 Campos et al Cost-effectiveness of Treatment for Hepatitis Cyears of life saved (YLS). The incremental ratio for a strategy was computed in comparison with the next mosteffective option after eliminating strategies that were dom-inated (more costly and less effective than other options) orruled out by extended (weak) dominance (strategies withhigher incremental cost-effectiveness ratios than more ef-fective options). We conducted sensitivity analyses to as-sess the influence of varying uncertain parameters andadopting alternative assumptions on our results. Model A deterministic state-transition Markov model (DATA 4.0;TreeAge Software Inc., Williamstown, Mass) was used tosimulate the natural history of HCV infection in patientsco-infected with HIV. Early stages of liver disease wereclassied using the Metavir scoring system, which charac-terizes the extent of brosis that results as damaged livercells are repaired, including no brosis (F0), portal carcinoma(Figure 1 ). Monthly transition probabilities were derivedfrom the literature and allowed individuals to move through different health states over time. We made the following assumptions: HCV infection may resolve through successful treatment,implying clearance of HCV RNA 20; Patients without a sustained viral response to HCV treat-ment (as dened by an HCV RNA level of /H1102150 IU per milliliter 24 weeks after completion of therapy) receivedno clinical benet and were subject to pretreatment ratesof HCV-related liver disease progression 11,21; Patients in early stages of liver disease who experienceda sustained viral response were no longer at risk forHCV-related liver disease 22; Patients with cirrhosis received treatment, and if it waseffective they regressed to Metavir stage F3; if treatment was ineffective they were still at risk for decompensatedcirrhosis 23; Response to treatment was conditional on genotype11; The rate of brosis progression in the absence of ef-fective treatment was conditional on age and sex, andremained the same for transition to the next higherMetavir stage; All patients were assumed to have a stable CD4 cell countbetween 200 and 500 cells/mm 3and to be receiving HAART for HIV; and Figure 1 Overview of the Markov model.274 The American Journal of Medicine, Vol 120, No 3, March 2007Patients with decompensated cirrhosis were eligible for liver transplantation.24,25 Data Selected parameters used in the model are shown in Table 2 . We used baseline age- and sex-specic rates of progressionfrom chronic HCV infection to cirrhosis based on an em-pirically calibrated model of chronic HCV in mono-infectedpatients. 17,26We modied these based on data from studies comparing the relative progression in HIV co-infected pa-tients versus mono-infected patients. 27-30We assumed wassimilar in co-infected patients and derived from a cost-effectiveness study inmono-infected patients. 31Excess mortality due to HIV was based on data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study,from which CD4-specic rates were derived to parameterizea natural history model of HIV/AIDS published by Freed-berg et al 32; an additive relationship to age- and sex-stan- dardized mortality rates was assumed. We then comparedthe model's predictions of cirrhosis prevalence with a pub-lished study by Di Martino et al that was not used for naturalhistory parameter estimation. 33Among an HIV-HCV co- infected cohort of former intravenous drug users with anaverage 10.6-year duration of HCV infection and a meanCD4 count of 482 cells/mm 3, 59% of whom had received interferon monotherapy (overall efcacy of 6.4%) and 73%of whom were male, had cirrhosis at baseline and17.5% had cirrhosis at follow-up 4.7 years later. 33Our model predicted that in a cohort of patients with this sex andtreatment prole and duration of HCV infection, 16% hadcirrhosis over the same follow-up period. Annual costs of care related to chronic HCV infection and liver disease included detailed estimates of resourceutilization, including hospitalizations, outpatient visits, lab-oratory tests, medications, and interventions. 31Treatment costs were based on average wholesale drug prices34com- bined with previously published cost estimates for clinicvisits, laboratory tests, and the treatment of adverseevents. 35The annual costs of HIV care for patients on HAART with CD4 count between 200 and 500 cells/mm3 were obtained from a recently published model for HIVscreening. 36,37 In the base case we assumed treatment for 48 weeks,11-13 and dosages resembled those in APRICOT: for interferonand ribavirin, 3 million IU interferon for pegylated interferon and ribavirin,pegylated interferon as described above plus 800 mg riba-virin/day. We made the conservative assumption that allpatients completed the full course of medication. In sensi-tivity analyses, we explored a second treatment protocol andassumed that patients without an early virologic response atweek 12 discontinued treatment. The percentage of suchpatients was drawn from APRICOT and varied by treatmentarm. We assessed early treatment withdrawal due to adverseevents or abnormal laboratory values in a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS Table 3 shows the discounted lifetime costs, life expect- ancy, and incremental cost per YLS for each treatmentstrategy, stratied by sex and genotype. For the men in ourmodeled cohort, the average discounted life expectancywithout treatment was 11.6 years and lifetime costs were$240,300. In men with genotype 1, treatment for HCVprovided incremental gains ranging from 1.0 to 5.2 monthscompared with no therapy. Combination therapy with pe-gylated interferon and ribavirin dominated all other strate-gies because it was both more effective and had a lower(more attractive) cost-effectiveness ratio. Compared with notherapy, its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was$73,000 per YLS. For men with non-genotype 1 HCV, treatment provided incremental gains ranging from 3.0 to 10.7 months com-pared with no therapy. Again, combination therapy withpegylated interferon and ribavirin was the dominant strat-egy. Compared with no therapy, its incremental cost-effec-tiveness ratio was $39,700 per YLS. Results in women werevery similar. In an exploratory analysis assuming cessation of treat- ment when no early virologic response occurs, the rankordering of strategies remained the same. The incrementalcost-effectiveness ratio for combination therapy with pegy-lated interferon and ribavirin became more attractive\u2014lower by 19% in men with genotype 1 ($59,300 per by 17% in men with non-genotype 1 ($33,100 perYLS). Again, results in women were similar. Results were relatively insensitive to varying parameters across plausible ranges for treatment efcacies among pa-tients with cirrhosis and treatment risks. Results were mostsensitive to variation in the annual excess death rate due toHIV, brosis progression rates and treatment efcacies innoncirrhotic patients. Results were moderately sensitive todrug costs. For men with genotype 1 infection, when theexcess mortality due to HIV was reduced by 97%, theincremental cost-effectiveness ratio decreased to When excess mortality wasincreased 11-fold to represent death rates in patients with ahistory of severe opportunistic infections, the incrementalcost-effectiveness ratio increased so greatly that treatmentwas dominated by nontreatment. We conducted a 2-way sensitivity analysis in which we varied the effectiveness of combination therapy with pegy-lated interferon and ribavirin, and the relative risk of brosisprogression due to co-infection with HIV ( Figure 2 ). When treatment efcacy exceeded 50%, cost-effectiveness ratioswere consistently less than $50,000 per YLS, regardless ofthe relative risk of brosis progression. When efcacy was/H1102225%, ratios were consistently /H11021$100,000 per YLS across the entire plausible range of relative risk assumptions.

Fibrosis progression rates are assumed to be linearly interpolated in these ranges. Progression rates were the same for Metavir stages F0 to F4. All patients receive the full 48-week course of therapy.\u00a7Patients without an early virologic response receive only 12 weeks of therapy; protocol assumes nondrug costs by week 12 are two-thirds of nondrug costs for 48 weeks of therapy.276 The American Journal of Medicine, Vol 120, No 3, March 2007sion had slightly more influence on the cost-effectiveness of treatment. Results were sensitive to the discount rate used. With no discounting, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio wasapproximately 60% lower than in the base case, while adiscount rate of 5% resulted in a ratio that was 140% higherthan the base case. Varying the cost of pegylated interferonand ribavirin between 50% and 150% of the cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from $56,300 to$88,500 per YLS. DISCUSSION We found that treatment with pegylated interferon and riba-virin for chronic HCV infection in an urban cohort co-infected with HIV, with characteristics similar to the treat-ment-eligible subgroup in the HALO Study, will providesubstantial life expectancy gains. These gains are greatest inpatients with non-genotype 1 infection. Combination ther-apy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin was the mosteffective and cost-effective treatment strategy regardless ofgenotype or sex. There were substantial differences in the cost-effective- ness ratios between patients with genotype 1 and non-genotype 1 HCV, mainly attributable to differences in treat-ment response rates. There were only small differences inthe cost-effectiveness of treatment for men and women. Four trials to date have evaluated the efcacy of HCV treatment in HIV-HCV co-infected patients; we used ef-cacy results from the largest multicenter trial, APRICOT,for the base case analysis. 11-14Each trial found treatment tobe more efcacious in non-genotype 1 patients, but the magnitude of the differences varied by trial, as shown inFigure 2 . Because cost-effectiveness ratios are sensitive to treatment efcacy, a wide range of cost-effectiveness ratiosis possible. Despite our conservative assumptions, our cost-effectiveness results may be particularly favorable becauseAPRICOT efcacies are high relative to other trials' results.However, the APRICOT study's treatment protocol requir- ing 800 mg of ribavirin daily has become a relatively stan-dard clinical practice. The AIDS Clinical Trials Group(ACTG) trial, on the other hand, administered ribavirinaccording to a dose-escalation schedule. 13The Agence Na- tionale de Recherches sur le Sida (ANRS) HCO2-RIBAVICtrial's exclusion criteria for subjects was less stringent thanthe other trials, allowing patients with alcohol intake up to40 grams per day for women or 50 grams per day for mento participate; 21% of this study population had psychiatricdisorders, and 40% had bridging brosis or cirrhosis. 12 These factors may explain the higher efcacies demon-strated in the APRICOT study, but may also indicate thatthe RIBAVIC trial results might be more applicable to theurban cohort modeled here if treatment eligibility criteriaare relaxed. In contrast to results from a recent cost-effectiveness analysis in HCV mono-infected patients, the present studysuggests that monotherapy with pegylated interferon andcombination therapy with interferon and ribavirin are dom-inated strategies in co-infected populations. 17Our results also differ from those of Kuehne et al,16because this earlier cost-effectiveness analysis of HIV-HCV co-infected pa-Table 3 Cost-effectiveness of 4 Strategies by Treatment Protocol, Sex, and Genotype for Patients with CD4 Count 200-500 Cells/mm3 Strategy* Cost, 2004 US$ Life Expectancy, Years Incremental Cost per YLS Men Genotype all patients. Dominated strategy.277 Campos et al Cost-effectiveness of Treatment for Hepatitis Ctients assumed treatment efcacy and protocols were the same as in mono-infected patients. The APRICOT study notonly demonstrated that treatment efcacy is substantiallylower in co-infected patients, but that combination therapywith interferon and ribavirin rarely results in a sustainedviral response, even in non-genotype 1 patients. WhileKuehne et al found this strategy to be cost-effective($18,500 per YLS relative to no treatment in genotype 1patients and $63,500 per YLS relative to 24 weeks ofcombination therapy with interferon and ribavirin in non-genotype 1 patients), our analysis suggests that combinationtherapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin dominatesother treatment strategies. Due to limitations in data that would ideally inform a model of co-infection, our goals for this analysis weremodest and exploratory in nature, aiming to update a pre-vious analysis with treatment efcacy data and identifyinfluential parameters. Implications of our analysis are re-stricted to a specic target population of treatment-eligiblepatients with stable HIV disease and stable CD4 cell countsbetween 200 and 500 cells/mm 3. A more sophisticated model of co-infection that fully represents the natural his-tory of HIV disease will be necessary to explore importantquestions regarding the optimal timing of treatment forchronic HCV relative to antiretroviral therapy for HIV dis- ease, and potential interactions or additive toxicities be-tween treatments. Other limitations of our study include theuncertainty surrounding many of the model's parameters.Also, we did not consider health-related quality of lifein co-infected patients, and all of our costs wereliterature-based. We chose to use population characteristics and treatment eligibility criteria from an urban cohort that has been pre-viously described. 18While the treatment-eligible portion of the HALO Study cohort was in many respects similar to thepopulation studied by APRICOT, efcacy as demonstratedin a randomized controlled trial is not the same as effec-tiveness in a typical clinical setting. Prospective studiescurrently underway with the HALO Study and other cohortswill provide insight to treatment effectiveness in a particularpopulation of HIV-HCV patients. It is important to note thatonly 30% of the co-infected subgroup of the HALO Studycohort was eligible for HCV treatment; the remainder werenot eligible for a variety of reasons, including unstablesocial circumstances, concern about potential adverse ef-fects, and concern about ability to work during the treatmentcourse. 38 As treatment-eligible co-infected patients are not cur- rently the norm, further studies are needed to establish theeffectiveness of combination HCV therapy in populationswith low eligibility for treatment. Overcoming barriers toHCV treatment eligibility and initiation in HIV-HCV co-infected patients remains a priority, now that combinationtherapy has been demonstrated efcacious in certain popu-lations. For co-infected patients with stable HIV disease,treatment appears to be not only life-prolonging but cost-effective as well. References 1. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

BACKGROUND: Empathy is important in the physician - patient relationship. Prior studies have suggested that physician empathy may decline with clinical training. OBJECTIVE: To measure and examine student empa- thy across medical school years. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional stud of students at Boston University School of Medicine in 2006. Incoming students plus each class near the endof the academic year were surveyed. MEASUREMENTS: The Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy -Student Version (JSPE-S), a validated 20-item self-administered questionna ire with a total score ranging from 20 to 140. JSPE-S scores were controlled for potential confounders such as gender, age, anticipated financial debt upon graduation, and future career interest. RESULTS: 658 students participated in the study (81.4% of the school population). The first-year medical student class had the highest empathy scores (118.5), whereas the fourth-year class had the lowest empathyscores (106.6). Measured empathy differed between second- and third-year classes (118.2 vs 112.7, P< .001), corresponding to the first year of clinical training.Empathy appears to increase from the incoming to thefirst-year class (115.5 vs 118.5, P=.02). Students preferring people-oriented specialties had higher empa- thy scores than students preferring technology-oriented specialties (114.6 vs 111.4, P=.002). Female students were more likely than male students to choose people- oriented specialties (51.5 vs 26.9%, P<.001). Females had higher JSPE-S scores than males (116.5 vs 112.1, P<.001). Age and debt did not affect empathy scores. CONCLUSIONS: Empathy scores of students in the preclinical years were higher than in the clinical years.Efforts are needed to determine whether differences in empathy scores among the classes are cohort effects or represent changes occurring in the course of medicaleducation. Future research is needed to confirm whether clinical training impacts empathy negatively, and, if so, whether interventions can be designed to mitigate thisimpact.KEY WORDS: empathy; medical student education; physician attitudes. J Gen Intern Med 22(10):1434 -8 DOI 10.1007/s11606-007-0298-x\u00a9 Society of General Internal Medicine 2007 INTRODUCTION Empathy is the cornerstone of the physician -patient relation- ship. It is the physician 's ability to cognitively recognize a patient 's perspectives and experiences, and convey such an understanding back to the patient.1,2This understanding allows the patient to feel respected and validated.3,4Empathy promotes patient and physician satisfaction, contributes to patient enabling and participation, and may improve patient outcomes.1,5-10Furthermore, empathy improves the quality of data obtained from the patient, improves the physician 's diagnostic ability, and decreases the rate of miscommunication and lawsuits.1,3,4,11 There is concern among educators that clinical training may have an adverse effect on medical resident and student empathy. In one cohort of internal medical residents, empathywas measured to be highest at the beginning but decreasing by the end of internship, and remained low through to the end of residency. 12,13The work-related challenges, including long work hours and sleep deprivation, are reasons believed tocontribute to this decline. 14Studies among students have shown that empathy measured over the third year of one cohort of medical students declined,15and that a single medical school class had higher measured empathy at the start compared to the end of medical school.16 This study investigates empathy more closely across the entirety of medical school education while controlling for the potential confounding effects of gender, age, anticipated financial debt upon graduation, and future career interests. METHODS This is a cross-sectional study of all medical students enrolledat Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) during 2006.This study was approved by the Boston University Medical Center Institutional Review Board. STUDY PARTICIPANTS All incoming medical students and those completing first- through fourth-year medical school in 2006 were eligible toparticipate in the study.Received February 19, 2007 Revised June 12, 2007Accepted July 3, 2007Published online July 26, 2007 1434The BUSM curriculum is a traditional 4-year medical school with 2 years of preclinical study, with limited patient contact, followed by 2 years of clinical clerkships and electives. STUDY DESIGN One author (DC) distributed the self-administered, anony-mous surveys to the medical students between March andSeptember 2006. Incoming medical students were surveyedduring Orientation Week, before the beginning of first-year medical school classes. First- through fourth-year medical students were surveyed during classes or class events, whereattendance was recommended but not mandatory, at the end of their academic year. In total, 5 medical school classes were studied. The primary measure of empathy, the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy -Student Version (JSPE-S), is a 20-item psychometrically validated instrument measuring componentsof empathy among health professionals in patient care situa-tions. 2,17,18Respondents indicate their level of agreement to each item on a 7-point Likert scale. The JSPE-S total score ranges from 20 to 140, with higher values indicating a higherdegree of empathy. 2,17,18In past studies, total scores among medical students ranged from 115 to 123.1 and standard deviations ranged from 9.9 to 14.1.2,15,19,20 Students also specified gender, age, anticipated financial debt, and likelihood of choosing various specialties. Gender was included because practicing female physicians and med-ical students have been found to have higher empathy than their male counterparts. 2,19As empathy involves aspects of perception and concern, which may be gained with morematurity, we included age as a confounder. 21The anticipated level of financial indebtedness at graduation was assessed to the nearest $25,000. Financial indebtedness may potentially influence the selection of career choice and cause high debtstudents to prefer more lucrative (often technical) specialties. Students indicated their career specialty intentions, in terms of likelihood of entering each of the specialties listed inTable 1, on a 4-point Likert scale (very unlikely=1,...very likely= 4). The people-oriented and technology-oriented specialty categorizations were based on categories determined in priorstudies. 2,17Each student was assigned to one of these two categories after comparing his or her average Likert score for each group of specialties. For example, if the average score forall people-oriented specialties was 2.0 and the average scorefor technology-oriented specialties was 2.8, the student wasconsidered preferring technology-oriented specialties. Stu- dents with no difference in their scores were not included in analyses of specialty preference. We believed that studentswith higher measured empathy might associate with the people-oriented careers. As such, student career preferences could potentially confound our results and, thus, needed to becontrolled. This construct does not imply that career prefer- ence calibrates empathy but instead that students who feel that empathy enhances their skills would gravitate towardhigher levels of patient contact. A nonresponder was defined as a student who failed to return an administered survey. An adequate response to the survey was defined as having 16 or more of the 20 JSPE-Squestions answered. Surveys with fewer than 16 JSPE-S questions answered were discarded. In cases where surveys were incomplete but had more than 16 JSPE-S responses, we proratedthe total scores to give a score with a denominator of 140. Missing values were rare for most demographic factors and were simply imputed: age (overall mean) and debt category(mode). Missing values could not be imputed in a simple way for gender as imputation of gender affected the analysis. Thus, several approaches were taken. First, data were stratified intothree groups, male ,female , and gender unspecified . Second, using cases where gender was known as the end point, we constructed a discriminate function from the 20 JSPE-S ques- tions to discriminate male from female. Next, we applied this ruleto the gender unspecified subgroup and imputed their gender. Descriptive statistics and analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were run to compare the different JSPE-S scores among thedifferent classes and categorized groups, whereas controlling for the effects of gender, age, anticipated financial indebted- ness, and career preference. Post hoc ANOVA pairwise com-parisons were made using Tukey 's HSD test. All computations were done with SAS statistical software version 9. RESULTS Of the 723 surveys distributed, 658 surveys were returned foran overall response rate of 91.0%. These 658 respondents represent 81.4% of the total students at BUSM in 2006. No differences are seen in the demographic features (age andgender) between responders and nonresponders in the medical school (data not shown). Third-year students have the lowest response rate and the fourth year students have the lowestpercentage surveyed (see Table 2). Table 2shows the number of students by class among the 658 responding medical students. The number of surveys used in the analysis was 648 because 10 surveys had fewer than 16out of 20 responses. The primary multivariate ANOVA considers 4 factors: class, gender, anticipated financial debt, and career preference as wellas age. The initial ANOVA model contains all interactions, but highly nonsignificant interaction terms are discarded (data not shown). Hence, the ANOVA factors of interest are class ( the gender -class interaction term ( P=.11). The 15 subjects with unspecified gender have the lowest mean total scores, indicating that the gender values are notmissing at random. A discriminant function based on the 20-item JSPE-S, applied to the gender unspecified surveys, classifies all the unspecified surveys as males. While ex-Table 1.

Table 3shows the JSPE-S scores by class. The first-year medical school class has the highest empathy scores (118.5),whereas the fourth-year class has the lowest empathy scores (106.6). No difference is seen between first- and second-year classes (118.5 vs 118.2, P=.77), or between third- and fourth- year classes (112.7 vs 106.6, P=.10). There is a difference be- tween second- and third-year classes (118.2 vs 112.7, P<.001), which corresponds to the first clinical year in medical school.There is also a difference in JSPE-S scores between incoming and first-year classes (115.5 vs 118.5, and between incoming and second-year classes (115.5 vs118.2, P= .04). The incoming class has suggestive differences in empathy scores when compared to the third-year class (115.5 vs 112.7, P=.05), and the incoming class differs from the fourth-year class(115.5 vs 106.6, P=.02). When looking at the differences in JSPE-S scores by gender, female medical students have higher empathy than male medical students (116.5 vs 112.1, P<.001). Students prefer- ring people-oriented specialties as a career have higher empathy than students preferring technology-oriented special- ties (114.6 vs 111.4, P=.002). Age, while significant, has a small effect on empathy scores (scores rise 0.6 with age), but has no effect on other associations. Female students prefer people- oriented specialties more than men (61.9 vs 36.1%, P<.001). In our analysis, no association is noted between career pre- ference and anticipated financial debt among women ( P=.33) or men ( P=.96). There is no relationship seen between gender and anticipated financial indebtedness ( P=.29) or between different medical school classes and anticipated financial indebtedness ( P=.59). In addition, we find that 72.1% of med- ical students anticipate having more than $200,000 debt aftergraduation, whereas 14.8% of students anticipate having less than $25,000 debt.DISCUSSION In our cross-sectional study, empathy appears to increase during the first year of medical school, but falls after the third year (first clinical year) and remains down through the final year of medical school. JSPE-S scores differ by as great as11.9 points between the first- and fourth-year classes after adjusting for gender, age, financial indebtedness, and career preferences. Our results, although cross-sectional, are consistent with previous studies, suggesting that empathy decreases after clinical training in medical school. Using the JSPE-S, one cohort of medical students had a decline in empathy duringthe third year of medical school. 15This group of 125 third-year medical students exhibited a postclerkship decline in empathy of 2.5 points (123.1 to 120.6). The authors found no significantassociations between changes in empathy scores and gender, age, or academic performance on step 1 of the USMLE. 15 Another group measured empathy in a cohort of medical students at the beginning of medical school and just before graduation and found lower empathy scores in the graduating class.16Among another group of health care professionals, dental students, empathy scores also decreased after patientcare responsibilities began. 20The only other cross-sectional study of multiple medical school classes that we could find did not demonstrate differences in empathy across classes, butthis study used an outcome measure, which was not specifi- cally designed for health professionals. 22 Studies of medical resident empathy have noted similar declines. A cross-sectional study in an internal medicine program observed that first-year residents scored 4 points higher on the JSPE -Physician Version than third-year resi- dents (117.5 vs 113.5, P=.31).11 Whereas these studies lack an assessment of behavior, one recent report showed a positive association between the individuals 'scores on the JSPE-S in medical school and ratings of their empathic behavior made by their residency program director 3 years later.23This study suggests a long- term predictive validity of the self-report empathy scale. Various stressful aspects of medical education and training, such as long work-hours and sleep deprivation, as well as dependence on technology for diagnoses, shorter patienthospitalizations, and limited bedside interactions may contrib- ute to decreases in empathy. 14,24-27In response, some pro- grams now include clinical narrative or critical incidentwriting; classes on medically themed creative writing, litera-ture and art; journal writing; and use of standardized patients in the medical education curriculum to maintain or increase empathy. 28-34Studies offer conflicting results with respect to their impact on empathy. One group preliminarily measured an increase in empathy in students who participated in role- playing and simulated patient scenarios.35In contrast, an entireTable 3.

Lastly, student course evaluations and feedback suggest that students respond positively to these educational interventions and per-ceive themselves to be more sensitive and empathic toward theirpatients from such activities despite a lack of more objective outcomes. 26,28,31-34,36,37 Another possible explanation for the observed decrease in empathy may be an acculturation phenomenon. Student doctors experience a wide range of emotions and stresses and may struggle to maintain their empathy.14,38This would suggest that to remain effective for patients, students and trainees become less empathic as they face emotionally challenging and draining situations. Outcome measures toassess such a hypothesis should be included in future research. We found that medical students expressing a preference for people-oriented specialties had higher empathy scores thanthose expressing a preference for technology-oriented special- ties. These data are consistent with another study, which found that students likely choosing family medicine, internalmedicine, psychiatry, pediatrics, and obstetrics and gynecolo- gy had higher empathy scores than all other specialties, when controlled for gender effects. 22 Previous studies have demonstrated a difference in empa- thy among practicing physicians of different specialties. Physicians in people-oriented specialties, such as primarycare specialties (family medicine, internal medicine, andpediatrics), obstetrics and gynecology, emergency medicine, psychiatry, and medical subspecialties, had higher average empathy scores than physicians in technology-oriented spe-cialties \u2014anesthesiology, radiology, pathology, surgery, and surgical subspecialties (see Table 1). 2,17Psychiatrists had the highest mean JSPE -Physician Version score (127.0), primary care specialists scored from 120 -122, and the lowest values were noted in orthopedic surgeons and anesthesiologists (approx. 116).18 Students may possibly be prestratified in career preferences before coming to medical school, with those students who are naturally endowed with more empathy attracted to people-oriented specialties. Although we categorized medical studentsas preferring either people-oriented or technology-oriented specialties, the vast majority of incoming and first- through third-year medical students had small mean differencesranging from 0.46 to 0.62 when comparing their average Likert score for the people-oriented and technology-oriented specialty groups. This suggests that they may not be definitive in theircareer preference early in medical school and raises the possibility of changing career preferences with different experi- ences in medical school. Future studies should determinewhether fostering empathy skills impacts student careerpreferences. With fewer graduating medical students selecting careers in primary care (people oriented) specialties, 39-41if enhancement in empathy can be achieved and be shown tomodify career preference, potential policy implications regard- ing medical curricula and resource allocation could be possibly driven by societal or regional needs for primary care clinicians.There are several limitations of our study. First, our measurement of empathy, the JSPE-S, is self-reported. It measures medical students 'orientation to empathy and is not correlated with behavior. A recently demonstrated correla- tion between individuals 'empathy scores at the beginning of third year of medical school and ratings of their empathicbehavior at the end of their first year of postgraduate training does suggest predictive validity of the JSPE-S. 23Studies of practicing physicians have noted that JSPE score difference is asgreat as 11 between practicing psychiatrists and anesthesiolo-gists, 18a range difference seen in some of our comparisons. A second limitation of our study is the possibility of cohort effects. We recognize this as a limitation of all cross-sectionalstudies. However, except for our new finding of differences seen in the preclinical years, our data are consistent with other studies of medical student empathy, which suggest a declineduring medical school. 15,16Unexpectedly, we found that there is an increase in empathy scores from beginning to end of first- year among the medical students. As the JSPE-S questionswere designed to assess the empathy of health care providers in patient-provider situations, it is possible that a complete lack of clinical exposure impacts how the JSPE-S is completedby incoming students and hence the instrument may beinvalid in this group. Whereas there is limited patient contact in the first 2 years of our medical school, students do interact with patients when shadowing practicing physicians andparticipating in their clinical skills training courses. Patient contact in the context of the first 2 years of medical school possibly alters the perception of students so that the subjectiveanchors on JSPE-S questions and Likert-scale anchors are interpreted differently. Alternatively, the limited clinical expo- sure during the first 2 years of medical school may positivelyinfluence medical students 'empathy by reinforcing their desire to help people through medicine. A third hypothesis is that this represents a cohort effect. The robustness of our observation could be tested by sequentially tracking thesemedical student cohorts. Lastly, we acknowledge that attendance, survey participa- tion, and possibly response (e.g., level of empathy) may beinfluenced by the situations or events during which we obtained the data. Although our study is limited to one medical school, we feel that our results can be generalized to medical schools that have a traditional structure similar to ours. In particular, we are struck by the consistency of the decline in score after a fullyear of clinical exposure. CONCLUSION Empathy is important in the physician -patient relationship and has clear benefits for the patient and the physician. Wefound that there are differences in the empathy among the different classes and that empathy declines with increased clinical training in medical school. Whether the decline isreflective of the prevalent teaching methods and modifiablewith better methods or is an unavoidable psychological effect of the acculturation process into the medical profession is not yet known. The association of measured empathy and career preference among medical students is interesting. Although medical students indicate a career preference, the vast majority of1437 Chen et al.: Measurement of Medical Student Empathy JGIMthem are not strongly committed in their choice in the first 3 years of medical school. This association suggests the possibility that career preferences can possibly be changedwith changes in empathy. Current available data on the impact of interventions does not provide conclusive evidence that empathic behavior can be effectively and permanently im-proved. Future interventions should examine relationships between empathy, career preferences, and links with clinician behavior, as such finding would have the largest impact oneducational policy and practice.

Cheng, David Nunes, Howard Libman, John Vidaver, Julie K. Alperen, Richard Jeffrey H. Samet Background: Coinfection of human immunodeciency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a substantial medical and public health concern due to its increasing prevalence and complex patientmanagement. Alcohol use may worsen HCV-related liver disease and interfere with adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and medical care. We therefore studied the association between HCV infection and markers of HIV disease progression in adults with alcohol problems. Methods: This is a longitudinal study of 396 HIV-infected persons with alcohol problems, 199 (50%) of whom were coinfected with HCV (positive HCV RNA test). CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA levels were assessed at baseline and then every 6 months for up to 42 months. Hepatitis C virus RNAstatus was determined at study enrollment. We examined the relationship between HCV infection andlaboratory markers of HIV progression (CD4 cell count and log 10HIV RNA) by tting multivariable longitudinal regression models for each outcome. Results: Among subjects who were adherent to ART, the presence of HCV infection was associ- ated with a lower CD4 cell count (adjusted mean difference /C046.0 cells/ mL,p50.03). There was no association observed between HCV infection and CD4 cell count among those not adherent to ART or those not taking ART. No significant association was observed between HCV infection and HIV RNA regardless of ART status. Conclusions: Hepatitis C virus infection has an adverse effect on CD4 cell count in patients with alcohol problems who are adherent to ART. Addressing HCV coinfection among these patients may confer additional immunologic benet for this patient population. Key Words: Hepatitis C Virus, HIV, Coinfection, Disease Progression, Alcohol Abuse. COINFECTION WITH HUMAN immunodeciency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a substan-tial medical and public health concern because of its increasing prevalence and problematic patient management.With improved treatment of HIV infection, coin-fection with HCV is responsible for substantial morbidityand mortality in this patient population (Sulkowski et al., 2000). An estimated 15 to 30% of HIV-infected persons in t h eU n i t e dS t a t e sa n dE u r o p ea r ec o i n f e c t e dw i t hH C V(Sulkowski et al., 2002). In certain subgroups of HIV-infected patients, the prevalence of HCV coinfection is evenhigher. For example, 60 to 90% of HIV-infected personswith a history of injection drug use are coinfected with HCV(Bonacini and Puoti, 2000; Sulkowski and Thomas, 2003). The impact of HCV on HIV disease progression has been an area of active investigation with conflicting conclusions (Braitstein et al., 2006; De Luca et al., 2002;Dorrucci et al., 1995; Greub et al., 2000; Klein et 2003;Macias 1998; Piroth et 1998; Rancinan 2000; Sulkowskiand Thomas, 2003; Weis et al., 2006). For example, theresults of the 2 largest studies to date addressing this issueare inconsistent. Greub et al. (2000) reported that HCV infection was associated with decreased survival and more rapid progression to acquired immunodeciencysyndrome (AIDS) in 3,111 HIV-infected persons enrolledin the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. However, Sulkowski et al.(2002) found no association between HCV infection andFrom the Department of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts (DMC); the Clinical Addiction Research and Education (CARE) Unit, Section of General InternalMedicine, Boston Medical Center and Boston University School of Medi-cine, Boston, Massachusetts (DMC, JKA, RS, JHS); the Section of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Boston Medical Center, Bos- ton University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts (DN); theDepartment of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Div- isions of General Medicine and Primary Care and Infectious Diseases, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts (HL); DM-STAT,Inc., Malden, Massachusetts (JV); the Department of Epidemiology andYouth Alcohol Prevention Center, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts (RS); and the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston,Massachusetts (JHS).

Recommendations for management of HCV infection in HIV-infected patients continue to evolve (Alberti et al.,2005; Soriano et al., 2005), although HCV treatment is often the exception rather than the rule (Fleming et al., 2003). Patient management is complex because of thelimited effectiveness of and numerous contraindicationsto HCV therapy, its duration and adverse effects, potentialhepatotoxicity of ART, and lack of clarity concerningthe effect of HCV infection on HIV disease progression(Chung et al., 2004; Sulkowski and Thomas, 2003;Torriani et al., 2004). The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that HCV infection has an adverse effect on markers of HIVdisease progression in adults with alcohol problems. Previ-ous studies of patients starting ART have suggestedthat HCV infection is associated with a blunted CD4 cellrecovery (Greub et al., 2000). The biological mechanism ofsuch an effect is unclear, but HCV is known to replicate inmononuclear cells and recent studies have suggested that both HCV infection and HCV proteins may enhance lymphocyte apoptosis (Nunez et al., 2006; Thorenet al., 2004). It is important to study whether HCV impacts HIV disease progression in subjects with alcohol problems asalcohol use can be hepatotoxic and its use is prevalentamong HIV-infected persons (Cook et al., 1997; Krupitskyet al., 2005; Samet et al., 2004b). Alcohol use has also been shown to worsen HCV-related liver disease (Schiff, 1999) and interfere with patient adherence to ART and medicalcare (Kresina et al., 2002; Samet et al., alcohol on both HCV and HIV-related outcomesmakes it imperative to understand the effect of HCV onHIV disease progression among subjects with alcohol problems to inform the medical management of thispatient population. METHODS Study Design and Participant Recruitment Subjects were participants in HIV-Longitudinal Interrelationships of Viruses and Ethanol (HIV-LIVE), a prospective, observational cohort study of HIV-infected patients with alcohol problems. The study sample included a spectrum of alcohol problems that wasnot limited to a diagnosis of current alcohol abuse or dependence. Data were collected at baseline and every 6 months thereafter for up to 42 months. Of the 400 subjects, 38% ( n5154) were recruited from the HIV- ALC (HIV-Alcohol Longitudinal Cohort) study, a previous cohort study at Boston Medical Center (BMC). Inclusion and exclusion criteria for HIV-ALC and HIV-LIVE were identical. Subjects alsowere recruited from the Diagnostic Evaluation Unit ( n588, 22%) (Samet et al., 1995), an intake clinic for HIV-infected patients at BMC, and the HIV Primary Care and Specialty Clinics at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) ( n531, 8%). Remaining subjects ( n5127, 32%) were recruited through flyers distributed in health care centers, homeless shelters, and drug treatment programs, advertisements in newspapers and referrals from other HIV-LIVEsubjects. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of subject recruitmentacross various sources. Eligibility criteria were (1) documented HIV antibody test by ELISA conrmed by Western blot; (2) /C212 afrmative responses to the CAGE alcohol screening questionnaire (Buchsbaum et al., 1991;Mayeld et al., 1974) or diagnosis of lifetime alcohol abuse or depen- dence based on a study physician investigator clinical assessment; (3) ability to speak English or Spanish; and (4) at least 1 contact person.Exclusion criteria were: (1) score of o21 on the 30-item Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (Folstein et al., 1975; Smith et al., 2006); or (2) trained interviewer assessment that the patient could not comprehend informed consent or answer the interview questions.Eligible subjects who wished to participate provided written informed consent before enrollment. Enrollment began August 2001 and ended July 2003. Most interviews took place at the clinical Fig. 1. Distribution of subject recruitment.830 CHENG ET AL.research units. The Institutional Review Boards of Boston University Medical Center and BIDMC approved this study. Additional privacy protection was secured with a Certicate of Condentiality from the Department of Health and Human Services to protectsubjects from release of research data under court order or subpoena. Subject Assessment Subjects received an interviewer-administered assessment, including questions on demographics, HIV risk behaviors, alco- hol consumption, and ART use in the past 30 days. Past monthalcohol consumption was assessed using a validated calendarmethod (Sobell and Sobell, 1992). The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) Alcohol Module (Robins et al., 1988) was administered following study enrollment to determine current(past 6 months) and lifetime diagnoses of alcohol abuse and depend-ence. Recent drug use and current (past 12 months) diagnosis of drug dependence was assessed at enrollment using the CIDI. Drug use and drug dependence diagnosis (past 6 months) were assessed at eachfollow-up using the CIDI Short Form (Kessler et al., 1991). Inter- views were conducted in English or Spanish. We recorded CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA levels at each inter- view. Values were obtained by phlebotomy if not availablefrom clinical records within 4 months of the interview. Human immunodeciency virus RNA testing was performed using either a branched-chain DNA assay or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)(Pachl et al., 1995). The lower threshold of detection was between 50and 75 copies/mL over the course of the study. All subjects were tested for HCV infection by measurement of HCV antibody. Anti- body-positive subjects were tested for HCV RNA if this wasunavailable from medical records. Hepatitis C virus RNA was meas- ured using commercially available assays, either by branched chain DNA or PCR-based assays. The lower level of detection of theassays was 615 IU/mL. HCV antibody-negative subjects wereassumed to be HCV RNA negative (Thio et al., 2000). Outcomes The primary outcomes were CD4 cell count per microliter and log 10HIV RNA copies per milliliter, 2 laboratory markers of HIV disease progression. For analysis purposes, undetectable HIV RNAlevels were assigned half the value of the lower limit of detection.CD4 count/total lymphocyte count percentage was analyzed as a secondary endpoint. This value may be more reflective of immune status than absolute CD4 count in the setting of asplenia oradvanced liver disease (Zurlo et al., 1995). Primary Independent Variable The main independent variable was HCV infection status, dened as HCV RNA positive versus HCV RNA negative. Potential Confounding Factors Adherence to antiretroviral medications was determined using the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Questionnaire for Adherenceto Anti-Retroviral Medications (Chesney et al., 2000). Patientsreported their current antiretroviral medications, number of daily doses, and pills. Patients who reported being o100% adherent during the previous 3 days were considered not adherent; the 100%cut-off was used due to the brief timeframe of assessment. We usedinformation concerning current receipt of ART, dened as receiving at least one antiretroviral medication, and adherence to create a 3-category variable representing ART status: receiving ART andadherent, receiving ART and not adherent, or not receiving ART. Other potential covariates were gender, age, race (black, white, other), whether the subject was recruited from a previous cohortstudy of HIV-infected subjects with alcohol problems, homelessness, alcohol consumption, drug dependence diagnosis, injection drug use, time since starting HIV ART, and time since study enrollment. Homelessness was dened as at least 1 night in a shelter or on thestreet in the past 6 months (Kertesz et al., 2005). Alcohol use was categorized as heavy, moderate, or abstinent. Heavy alcohol use was dened as 414 drinks/wk or /C215 drinks on 1 occasion for men o66 years old and 47 drinks/wk or /C214 drinks on 1 occasion for men /C2166 years old and all women (NIAAA, 1995). Moderate alcohol use was dened as any drinking less than heavy amounts but not abstinent. Self-reported information was available on whethersubjects injected drugs in the 6 months before enrollment andlifetime injection behaviors. The latter variable was highly corre- lated with HCV infection, whereas the former was not. Thus, current injection drug use was selected as the covariate to avoid collinearityand because current injection drug use would be more likely to affect HIV disease progression. Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study sample at enrollment overall and by HCV RNA status. Continuous variables were compared between HCV RNA groups using t-tests or the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests wereused as appropriate to compare categorical variables. We examined the relationship between HCV infection and HIV progression by tting separate multivariable longitudinal regression models for eachoutcome. Generalized linear mixed effects models (Laird and Ware, 1982) were used to account for the correlation from using repeated observations on the same subject. Because the effect of HCVinfection on HIV progression was expected to differ based on ARTstatus, interactions between HCV RNA status and ART status were included in all models. The estimated effect of HCV infection is reported separately by ART status. Potential confounding factorswere included in regression models. Alcohol use, homelessness, andART status were included in regression models as time-varying covariates. Baseline CD4 cell count was included as a covariate in analyses of CD4 cell count. Analyses of HIV RNA did not adjust forbaseline values as it was expected that subjects had achieved their viral ''set points,'' and thus HIV RNA would remain somewhat constant over time. We evaluated whether alcohol use was aconfounder of the relationship between HCV infection and HIVprogression by excluding alcohol use and retting the multivariable regression models. The regression coefcients for HCV infection for the models with and without alcohol use were then compared toassess whether there was confounding by alcohol use. A change inestimate of 410% was used to identify confounding. Secondary analyses assessed whether time since starting HIV ART confounded the relationship between HCV infection and markers of HIV diseaseprogression by including it as an additional covariate in regression models. To minimize the potential for collinearity, we assessed correlation between pairs of independent variables and veried thatno pair of variables included in the same regression model was highlycorrelated (i.e., 40.40). All analyses were conducted using 2-sided tests and a significance level of 0.05. Analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Sample Size Considerations. Of the 396 subjects with known HCV RNA status, 185 were adherent to their HIV medications (99 HCV RNA positive; 86 HCV RNA negative), 61 were not adherent to their HIV medications (29 HCV RNA positive; 32 HCV RNAnegative), and 150 were not on HIV medications (71 HCV RNApositive; 79 HCV RNA negative) at study enrollment. These sample sizes allow our study 80% power to detect minimum differences in CD4 cell count of 134, 233, and 149 between HCV RNA positiveversus negative among subjects who were adherent, not adherent, and not on HIV medications, respectively. For the outcome log HIV RNA, our study has 80% power to detect differences as small as831 IMPACT OF HEPATITIS C ON HIV PROGRESSION0.54, 0.93, and 0.60 between HCV RNA positive versus negative subjects who were adherent, not adherent, and not on HIV medi- cations, respectively. Power calculations were based on 2-sided 2-sample t-tests using a significance level of 0.05. Standard deviations of 325 and 1.3 were assumed for CD4 cell count and log HIV RNA, respectively. Power calculations were based on a simple setting that utilizes a single time point, however the data were ana-lyzed using longitudinal regression methods that allow for repeatedobservations from subjects, therefore we expected to be able to detect smaller differences with equal power. RESULTS Study Subjects Of the 400 HIV-LIVE subjects, 235 (59%) were HCV antibody-positive. Of the 231 HCV antibody-positivesubjects who had an HCV RNA test, 199 (86%) wereHCV RNA positive. One HCV-infected subject receivedinterferon therapy during the study. Analyses wereconducted on 396 subjects with known HCV RNA status. Baseline characteristics of the study subjects are displayed in Table 1. The majority were male (75%), nonwhite race (67%), and housed (75%). The average age of the subjects was 42.5 years. At enrollment, 14%reported injection drug use (past 6 months), 43% had acurrent diagnosis (past 12 months) of drug dependence,70% had a lifetime diagnosis of alcohol dependence and18% alcohol abuse; 10% had a current diagnosis (past6 months) of alcohol dependence. Thirty-one percentreported heavy alcohol consumption, 11% moderate consumption, and 58% were abstinent in the past 30 days. Median CD4 cell count was 403 cells/ mL. Median log 10 HIV RNA was 2.95 and 31% of subjects had undetectable HIV RNA. Sixty-two percent were on ART (93% of thesesubjects were taking at least 3 HIV medications). Hepatitis C virus RNA-positive subjects were older (mean age 44 vs 41 years), more likely to have used injec-tion drugs in the past 6 months (23 vs 5%), and had a lower median CD4 cell count (356 vs 424 cells/ mL) compared with HCV RNA-negative subjects. Multivariable Regression Results The primary analyses used data from 396 subjects contributing 1,171 observations to examine CD4 cellcount and 1,542 observations for log HIV RNA. Humanimmunodeciency virus RNA analyses included a larger number of observations as log HIV RNA at enrollment was modeled as part of the longitudinal outcome whereasbaseline CD4 cell count was a covariate in CD4 cell countanalyses. The number of subjects included in CD4 cellcount analyses ( n5344) was less than that in HIV RNA analyses as only those with a follow-up interview (87%)were included in analyses of CD4 cell count. The mediannumber of observations per subject was 4 (interquartile range: 3-5) for CD4 cell count and HIV RNA. Table 2 presents results of the longitudinal regression analyses.Among subjects adherent to ART, those with detectableTable 1.

HIV, human immunodeciency virus; ART, antiretroviral therapy.832 CHENG ET AL.HCV RNA had lower CD4 cell counts (adjusted mean difference /C046.0 in CD4 cells/ mL,p-value 50.03). No association was observed between HCV infection andCD4 cell count for subjects not adherent to ART or nottaking ART. No significant association was observedbetween HCV RNA status and log HIV RNA regardlessof ART status (Table 2). For the secondary endpoint percent CD4 cells, HCV RNA positivity was associated with a lower percentage of CD4 cells (adjusted mean difference /C02.3%, p-value o0.01) among those adherent to ART. No association was observed between HCV infection and percentagesof CD4 cells among those not adherent to ART and thosenot on ART (Table 2). We also evaluated whether alcohol use was a confounder of the relationship between HCV infection and HIV disease progression. In the multivariable regression models that did not adjust for alcohol use, the estimated effects ofHCV infection were similar to the primary modelsthat adjusted for alcohol use, suggesting that alcohol usewas not a confounder. Among subjects adherent to ART,those with detectable HCV RNA had lower CD4 cellcounts (adjusted mean difference /C044.9 in CD4 cells/ mL, p-value50.03) and lower percentage of CD4 cells (adjust- ed mean difference /C02.2%, p-valueo0.01). The results were similar after adjusting for time since starting HIV ART in the regression models. Among sub-jects adherent to ART, subjects with detectable HCVRNA had significantly lower CD4 cell counts (adjustedmean difference 44.5 in CD4 cells/ mL,p-value50.03) and percentage of CD4 cells (adjusted mean difference 2.2%,p-valueo0.01). DISCUSSION Coinfection with HCV is common in HIV-infected patients, especially among those with injection drug use.Determining whether HCV coinfection affects HIV disease progression is important for understanding theoptimal timing and sequencing of therapies for theseinfections. This is a particularly key issue for coinfectedpersons with alcohol problems due to several complicatingfactors: alcohol exposure can result in more rapidprogression of liver disease (Schiff, 1999); heavy alcoholuse is a contraindication for interferon therapy (Soriano et al., 2005); and alcohol use is associated with worse adherence to ART (Kresina et al., 2002). Analysis of thisprospective cohort of HIV-infected persons with alcoholproblems demonstrated a significant association betweencoinfection with HCV and lower CD4 cell counts amongpatients adherent to ART. Reductions were presentin both CD4 cell count and percentage, suggesting theseeffects were probably not related to hypersplenism second- ary to the underlying liver disease. Analyses controlled for multiple characteristics associated with HIV diseaseprogression. The observation of a lower CD4 cell count in patients with HCV infection that were receiving and adherent toART is of particular interest. These ndings are consistentwith those described by Greub et al. (2000) in the SwissHIV Cohort Study in which initiation of ART in HCV coinfected persons was associated with an attenuated recovery in CD4 cell count compared with those withoutHCV. Similar to subjects adherent to ART in the currentstudy, Greub and colleagues found a decreased response ofCD4 cell count to ART among coinfected persons despiteno observed differences in HIV RNA. Interestingly, afollow-up report from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study inves-tigators showed that differences in CD4 cell count between these groups did not persist after 4 years of follow-up (Kaufmann et al., 2003). This ''muting'' effect of HCVinfection on CD4 cell count response to ART has beenshown in other studies (De Luca et al., 2002; Law et al.,2004), but differs from the recently published EUROSIDATable 2.

HIV, human immunodeciency virus; ART, antiretroviral therapy.833 IMPACT OF HEPATITIS C ON HIV PROGRESSIONstudy and a smaller prospective U.S. study which showed no effect of HCV on CD4 cell recovery (Chung et al., 2002;Rockstroh et al., 2005). The reason for discrepancies across study ndings is unclear. They may be related in part to the timepoints atwhich CD4 cell recovery was measured, particularly ifHCV infection delays but does not prevent immunologicreconstitution. Why HCV should affect CD4 cell countrecovery in the face of similar HIV viral suppression isunknown, though it may indicate that HCV infection has adirect effect on CD4 cells rather than being mediated through HIV viral replication. This study's nding that coinfection of HCV and HIV is associated with lower CD4cell counts among those adherent to ART is consistent withother observations suggesting a direct effect of HCV on theimmune system (Bare et al., 2003, 2005; El-Serag et al., 2002;Pawlotsky et al., 1995). Recent data have shown that HCVproteins and HCV infection of mononuclear cells apoptosis (Nunez et al., 2006; Thoren et al., 2004). It is unclear why we observed an effect of HCV only in those individualsreceiving ART. However it is possible that exposure to anti-retroviral medications enhances the oxidative or apoptotic''stress'' within these cells. I t is also possible that HCV indu- ces alterations in CD4 cells th rough an alternative but poorly dened mechanism as HCV infection is associated with anumber of lymphoproliferative and autoimmune conditions including cryogloblinemia, lymphoma, and autoimmune phenomena. Whether HCV infection has an effect on mortality in HIV-infected patients is controversial. Several studieshave shown increased mortality in those with HCVcoinfection (Anderson et al., 2004; Backus et al., 2005;Braitstein et al., 2005; Weis et al., 2006), while others haveobserved similar rates (El-Serag et al., 2005). Although we did not examine the effect of HCV on this clinical endpoint, a major strength of this study was the ability tocontrol for factors such as presence of detectable HCVRNA, active drug and alcohol use, medication adherenceand social factors such as homelessness. These factors werenot addressed in several larger cohort studies (Backuset al., 2005; De Luca et al., 2002; El-Serag 2005;Jaggy et al., Keiser et Law et al., 2004; Quintana et al., 2003; Rockstroh et al., 2005). Although alcohol use may worsen HCV-related liver disease and interfere with medical care, we did not ndevidence in our data to suggest that alcohol use is aconfounder of the association between HCV status andHIV disease progression. Our ndings that HCV infectionhas an adverse effect on CD4 cell count and percent CD4cells in patients adherent to ART persisted regardless of whether alcohol use was accounted for in the analyses. This study's ndings have important implications for understanding the optimal management approach forcoinfected patients. Recent work has shown that effectivetreatment of HIV infection can significantly reducethe risk of HCV-related liver disease progression (Qurishi et al., 2003). However, our results suggest that HCVinfection may adversely impact HIV-related immune reconstitution. If this is true, additional improvement in HIV outcomes may be achieved by effective treatmentof HCV infection in patients who are adherent to ART.Corroboration of these ndings would add effective HCVtreatment to the multidimensional approach to addressHIV infection and strengthen the argument to initiateHCV therapy early in the course of HIV disease. Thesendings may also support the earlier introduction of ART in HCV coinfected individuals to both offset the negative impact of HIV on HCV disease progression and thepotentially negative impact of HCV on CD4 cell recovery. The limitations of this study merit explanation. As HCV coinfection is more common in injection drug users, thisgroup's delayed presentation for medical care, comparedwith noninjection drug users, may account for lower CD4cell counts among coinfected individuals (Samet et al., 2001). However, adjustment for CD4 cell count at study enrollment in the multivariable analysis should mitigatethis argument. Also, HCV-negative subjects were notdiagnosed with HIV earlier and had not been on ARTlonger than HCV-positive subjects, suggesting our resultsare not explained by the groups being in care for differentlengths of time. It is possible that we did not adequatelycontrol for all potential contributing factors to HIV disease progression. Nonetheless, multiple characteristics known to be associated with HIV disease progression wereincluded as covariates in the multivariable analyses. Thisstudy may have been underpowered to detect a statisticallysignificant effect of HCV infection. The observed differen-ces in CD4 cell count and log HIV RNA between the HCVRNA-positive and negative subjects were smaller than anti-cipated, thus it is likely that the study was not adequately powered to detect associations of the observed magnitude. In summary, in this cohort of subjects with alcohol problems, HCV infection is associated with lower CD4cell counts in patients adherent to ART. Addressing HCVcoinfection in HIV-infected patients who have maximizedART may confer additional immunologic benet for thispatient population.

Cheng, SeD Boston Medical Center and Boston University, MA Anita Raj, PhD, MS Boston University, MA Jeffrey H. Samet, MD, MA, MPH Boston Medical Center and Boston University, MA Data from the HIY-Alcohol Longitudinal Cohort was used to determine the prevalence of substance use by victims and assailants during physical and sexual assault against HIY-infected persons and whether these findings differed by gender. Of the sexually assaulted participants, 31% of victims and 70% of assailant(s) had used drugs/alcohol during sexual assault. Compared with men, women had higher odds of substance use duringsexualassault (adjustedodds ratio [OR]3.8,95%confidenceinterval[Cl] 1.6 to 8.7) and of substance use by their assailant(s) during sexual assault (adjusted OR 5.9, 95% Cl 1.7 to 20.6) in adjusted analysis. Of the physically assaulted participants, 66% of victimsand85%ofassailantsuseddrugs/alcoholduringphysicalassault;theseresults did not differ by gender. Keywords: alcohol use; drug use; violence; victims; abuse The association of substance use with violence has been well established. High rates of chronic drug and alcohol abuse have been described among both assailants and victims of violent crimes, sexual assault, and intimate partner violence (Abbey, Zawacki, Buck, Clinton, & McAuslan, 2001; Chermack Caetano, Kilpatrick, Acierno, 1997; Lown & Vega, 2001; Rivara et al., 1997; Sharps, Campbell, Campbell, Gary, & Webster, 2001; Zavala & French, 2003). Other work has also shown that assailants and victims of sexual and physical violence are often substance using at the time of the event (Caetano, Schafer, & Cunradi, 2001; Chermack & Blow, 2002; Kantor 216 \u00a9 2007 Springer Publishing Company 2/7 Substance Use During Sexual and Physical Assault in HIV & Straus, 1989; Mohler-Kuo, Dowdall, Koss, & Wechsler, 2004; Thompson 2004). In fact, one review estimated that 45% of intimate partner violence perpetrated by men involved alcohol (Roizen, 1993). However, the role of substance use during violence experienced by HfV-infected groups and how it is affected by gender of the victim has not been well described. Violence among those with HIV and at risk for HIV may be even greater than among the general population (Bedimo, Kissinger, & Bessinger, 1997; Cohen et aI., et al., et al., 2000). Sixty\u00ad six percent of HIV-infected women in one cohort reported a history of assault, with 21% having been victimized in the past year and 31 % reporting a history of sexual assault before age 18 (Cohen et aI., 2000). Another study of HIV -infected women found that 32% had a history of sexual assault during their lifetime (Bedimo et al., 1997). Although less is known about the prevalence of abuse among HIV-infected men, it appears that they are commonly victims of violence as well. Data from the HIV Costs and Service Utilization Study revealed that 20.5% of women, 11.5% of men having sex with men, and 7.5% of heterosexual men reported physical harm since HIV diagnosis, nearly half of whom reported HIV as the cause of violence (Zierler et al., 2000). This is highly concerning given the association that victimization has with several negative health measures in cross\u00ad sectional studies of Hl'V-infected persons. For example, victimization has been associated with increased medical disease, health care utilization, and substance use characteristics (Eisenman, Cunningham, Zierler, Nakazono, & Shapiro, 2003; Liebschutz, Feinman, Sullivan, Stein, & Samet, 2000). Additionally, sexual victimization has been associated with high-risk sexual behavior in HlV-infected persons (Bogart et aI., 2005; Chuang, Liebschutz, Horton, & Samet, 2006). These findings further emphasize the need to better characterize violence against HIV-infected persons. The pathway through which substance use contributes to violence is likely multifold and perhaps different from one situation to another. For example, some assailants may have the desire to commit sexual assault, and that desire also leads them to drink alcohol. Alcohol use could then be a consequence rather than a cause for the assault. Conversely, alcohol use may actually be the facilitator to violence, which is supported by the hypothesized proximal role of substance use in violent acts (Fals-Stewart, Golden, & Schumacher, 2003). In these situations, alcohol may affect cognitive ability and reduce inhibitions that ultimately lead to assault. Another contributing factor may be the social situations in which violence occurs; for example, certain situations may encourage both drinking and sexual assault, such as bars or parties (Abbey et al., 2001). Since HIV-infected groups may be more at risk for both chronic substance use (Bing et aI., 2001; Cook et aI., 2001; Galvan et aI., 2002; Samet, Phillips, Horton, Traphagen, & Freedberg, 2004) and violence victimization (Bedimo et al., 1997; Cohen et al., 2000; McDonnell et al., 2003), we hypothesize that they may be particularly susceptible to substance-involved acts of violence during their lifetimes. Little is known about the role of acute intoxication during violence experienced in the lives of HIV-infected individuals. One study found that victims of violence who were HIV -infected women were more likely to report using alcohol before or during a violent episode than HIV -negative women (McDonnell et al., 2003). Research in this area has focused on female victims of substance-involved assault, but men are likely at risk as well. Although women are more likely to be victims of assault in the context of intimate relationships, men are overall more often the victims of physical violence (Craven, 1997). Interestingly one study found that incident-specific alcohol use by perpetrators was more common during intimate partner 218 Chuang et at. violence against women than against men (Thompson & Kingree, 2004). Conversely, another study found that men were more likely than women to have been drinking during the violent episode, independent of whether the man was the perpetrator or the victim (Caetano et al., 2001). The present study uses the baseline cross-sectional data from the HIV-Alcohol Longitudinal Cohort (HIV-ALC) study, a cohort of Hl'V-infected persons with a lifetime history of alcohol problems. In this cohort, 81 % of the participants had experienced physical or sexual violence in their lifetime, and 40% of the participants experienced physical or sexual violence at some time during the 3-year follow-up period (Liebschutz, Geier, Horton, Chuang, & Samet, 2005). Our objective was to describe the prevalence of substance use by both assailants and victims during lifetime violence using data collected at the baseline time point and to observe whether the results differed by gender of the victim. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Design and Participant Recruitment The HIV-ALC study recruited HlV-infected individuals with a history of alcohol prob\u00ad lems with the primary aim of evaluating the effect of alcohol use on EIV progression (Samet, Horton, Traphagen, Lyon, & Freedberg, 2003). The current study is a cross\u00ad sectional analysis using the baseline data of subsamples of this cohort who reported experiencing either sexual or physical assault. The Institutional Review Boards of Boston Medical Center and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center approved this study. Patients were recruited principally from the Boston Medical Center HIV Diagnostic Evaluation Unit (Samet et al., 1995), a weekly clinic for engaging HIV-infected per\u00ad sons into medical care. Participants were also recruited from other sites: the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a respite facility for homeless persons. a methadone clinic, Boston Medical Center's primary care practices, referrals by friends, and through posted flyers at homeless shelters and HIV IAIDS social service agencies in the Boston area. Eligibility criteria were confirmed HIV infection, a lifetime history of alcohol problems (defined as two or more positive responses to the CAGE questionnaire [Ewing, 1984]), and age ~18 years. Those patients recruited from the Boston Medical Center HIV Diagnostic Evaluation Unit who did not meet CAGE criteria were eligible if one of two attending phy\u00ad sicians made a specific diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence. Other inclusion criteria were fluency in English or Spanish, a Mini-Mental State Examination score 2':21 (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975), and no plans to move residence from the Boston area for the next 2 years. Recruitment ran from June 1997 to July 2001. Informed consent was obtained from subjects who met the eligibility criteria and agreed to participate in the study. A trained research associate administered structured in-person confidential interviews in English or Spanish. For the measures used in this analysis, the Spanish items were created by translating from English, then back translating to check for accuracy, and corrected. Most interviews were performed at the General Clinical Research Center of the Boston University School of Medicine. Definition of Variables Data collected included demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, hornelessness), interpersonal violence exposure, alcohol and dru use, and HIV 219 Substance Use During Sexual and Physical Assault in HIV transmission category. Homelessness was defined as at least one night in a shelter or on the street in the past 6 months. Alcohol use in the past 30 days was categorized as hazardous, moderate, or abstinent. These categories were derived from the Department of Health and Human Services (2000) definition for hazardous use (> 14 drinks per week for men < 66 years old and> 7 drinks per week for men 2: 66 years old and all women or 2: 5 drinks on one occasion for men < 66 years old and 2: 4 drinks on one occasion for men 2: 66 years old and all women). Moderate alcohol use was defined as any drinking less than hazardous. The questions used to assess violence exposure were adapted from a previous study designed to describe interpersonal violence among persons with a history of substance abuse (Liebschutz et al., 2002). To assess for sexual violence, the subjects were asked, \"Have you ever been sexually assaulted (for example: unwanted sexual touching any\u00ad where on your body, touching of genitals and/or breasts, or made to have oral sex or vaginal or anal intercourse against your will by force or the threat of force)?\" If an assault history was reported, the participants were asked whether they were using alcohol or drugs when they were assaulted. Response categories were \"never,\" \"some cases,\" \"most cases,\" or \"all cases.\" The outcome variable created to represent substance use during assault was dichotomous (never vs, at least some cases). Participants were then asked whether the person who assaulted them was using alcohol or drugs when they were assaulted, using the same response categories and outcome variable. To assess for a history of physical assault, the participants were asked, \"Have you ever been physically abused or assaulted (for example: kicked, hit, choked, shot, stabbed, burned, or held at gunpoint)?\" If a history of physical assault was reported, subjects were asked whether they or their assailants were using drugs or alcohol at the time of physical assault, in the same manner as for sexual assault. For each type of assault reported (sexual or physical), participants were asked their age at first victimization and whether the assailant(s) were stranger(s), nonstranger(s), or both. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SAS/STAT v.8.2 (SAS Institute, 2001). The data analysis for this study was restricted to the subgroups of participants who reported a history of sexual or physical assault. Descriptive data for demographic and substance use charac\u00ad teristics are presented by assault history and gender. The proportion of assault victims and assailants with a history of substance use during sexual and physical assault is reported. The odds of substance use by the victim and the assailant during both sexual and physical assault was then compared by gender using logistic regression modeling, adjusting for age (continuous), race (White vs. non-White), and the victim-assailant relationship (stranger, nonstranger, or both). For all analyses, two-tailed tests were performed using p < .05 as criterion for statistical significance. Childhood sexual assault and childhood physical assault (occurring before age 13) were considered as potential confounders in the analyses of substance abuse during assault but were excluded from the final logistic regression models because of potential collinearity with victim-assailant relationship (i.e., participants reporting childhood assault were significantly more likely to report nonstranger assailants than those not reporting childhood assault). In subsequent analysis, the childhood assault variables were assessed as potential confounders in regression models that did not include the victim-assailant relationship variable. In this analysis the primary relationship of gender with substance use during assault was not confounded by a history of childhood assault. 220 Chuang et al. RESULTS The HIV-ALC cohort (N = 349) was recruited from the following locations: 56% from the Boston Medical Center HIV Diagnostic Evaluation Unit, 16% from posted flyers, 13% from Boston Medical Center's primary care practices, 5% from a respite facility for homeless persons, 4% from a methadone clinic, 4% from friend referrals, and 2% from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Most study subjects (313/349 [90% Dmet the eligibility criteria of two or more positive responses to the CAGE questionnaire (Ewing, 1984); the remainder qualified on the basis of clinical assessment (36/349 [10% D. The majority of the participants completed the interviews in English, while 26 (3%) completed the interview in Spanish. Participant Characteristics Eighty-one percent of the cohort (281/349) had experienced either sexual and/or physical assault in their lifetime, with 139 (40%) reporting a history of sexual assault and 266 (76%) reporting a history of physical assault. The sexual and physical assault groups were not mutually exclusive since more than one-third of the participants expe\u00ad rienced both sexual and physical assault (36%). All subsequent analysis is restricted to subjects reporting some type of assault. Characteristics of the participants who experienced either sexual assault or physical assault with comparisons by gender are shown in Table I. Among those reporting a lifetime history of sexual assault, the men were more likely to have used alcohol in the past 30 days but less likely to have used heroin in the past 30 days than the women. Men reporting a lifetime history of physical assault were older, more likely to be homeless, more likely to have consumed alcohol in the past 30 days, but less likely to have used heroin in the past 30 days than women. Childhood assault was very common, with 63% of sexual assault victims and 47% of physical assault victims reporting first assault before age 13. Substance Use During Sexual Assault Data concerning substance use during sexual assault is shown in Table 2. Of the 139 subjects who had been sexually assaulted, 31% (95% CI 23% to 39%) reported they used drugs or alcohol during at least some cases of sexual assault, and 70% (95% CI 64% to 76%) reported their assailant had used drugs or alcohol during at least some cases of sexual assault. Gender differences were clinically and statistically significant. Female sexual assault victims were significantly more likely than male sexual assault victims to report substance use during sexual assault (51% vs. 19%, adjusted OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.6 to 8.7), adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and victim-assailant relationship. Substance use by the assailant during sexual assault was also reported significantly more often by female victims (88% vs. 58%, adjusted OR 5.9,95% CI 1.7 to 20.6) in the adjusted analysis. Substance Use During Physical Assault Data concerning substance use during physical assault are also shown in Table 2. Of the 266 subjects who had been physically assaulted, 66% (95% CI 60% to 72%) reported they had used drugs or alcohol during at least some cases of physical assault, and 85% (95% CI 81% to 89%) reported their assailant had used drugs or alcohol during at least some cases of physical assault. The odds of substance use by either the subject or the assailant were similar for men and women. 221 Substance Use During Sexual and Physical Assault in HIV TABLE 1.

DISCUSSION Substance use during assault by both HlV -infected victims and their assailants was high in this cohort of HlV-infected persons with a history of alcohol problems. In fact, the major\u00ad ity of the assault victims reported that their assailants were substance using during both physical and sexual assault. Similarly, a large number of participants reported that they themselves were substance using when they were victimized, particularly during physical assault. Compared with men, women experiencing sexual assault were significantly more likely to report substance use by both themselves and their assailants. The reasons for this are unclear. We initially hypothesized that men who experienced sexual assault may be more likely to have been victimized as children exclusively, when they would be less likely to be substance using. However, in a separate analysis looking only at the partici\u00ad pants who experienced sexual assault after childhood (age ~13), we found that women victims were still significantly more likely to report substance use during sexual assault 222 Chuang et al. TABLE 2.

Women were also still more likely than men to report substance use by their assailants among those only experiencing sexual assault after childhood (88% vs. 59%, unadjusted OR 5.25, 95% CI 0.90 to 30.62) compared with the full sample (88% vs. 58%, unadjusted OR 5.39,95% CI 1.67 to 17.42); this difference was no longer statistically significant, likely because of the smaller sample size. Note that the adjusted OR for the full sample was 5.88 (95% CI 1.68 to 20.58), but we were unable to run an adjusted model for those experience sexual assault after childhood because of a limited number of events. An alternative explanation to the gender findings is the possibility that the social situations around which sexual assault occurs differ for men and women. Women may be more likely fall victim to sexual assault when they are in social situations that encourage both drinking and sexual pursuit, like bars or parties (Abbey et aI., 200 I), and perhaps the environments for victimization of men differ. Additionally, whether differences exist in the social situations and environ\u00ad ments that lead to intimate partner violence against men who have sex with men versus heterosexual men is unclear from our study. Further investigation of these issues is needed to elucidate the relationship of substance use and violence against HIV -infected men. We were interested in whether a history of childhood assault would bias the study findings. Since childhood sexual abuse victims are more susceptible to both increased substance use and violence victimization in adulthood (Bartholow et al., 1994; Dilorio, Hartwell, & Hansen, 2002; Johnsen & Harlow, 1996; Wingood & DiClemente, 1997), we hypothesized that they would be more susceptible to substance involved violence expe\u00ad rienced in adulthood. However, the limited data collected on childhood assault did not allow us to fully address this hypothesis; whether a participant had experienced assault during childhood only or in adulthood as well could not be distinguished. In this sample, childhood sexual assault was found to be negatively associated with substance use by the victim during sexual assault. We suspect that this finding was driven by participants who experienced sexual assault during childhood only, when substance use by the victim would be less likely. As described previously, collinearity between childhood assault and the vic\u00ad tim-assailant relationship variable did not allow us to assess the effects of both variables 223 Substance Use During Sexual and Physical Assault in HIV simultaneously and led to exclusion of the childhood assault variable from the final analy\u00ad sis. However, the primary relationship of gender with substance use during assault was not modified when the childhood assault variable was assessed in regression models that did not include the victim-assailant relationship variable. This study has certain limitations. There is potential for recall and reporting bias with self-report of sensitive data that reflects a lifetime experience. The topics being recalled, however, concerned very important life events, which are not likely to be forgotten. In addition, the interviews were performed confidentially by staff trained to facilitate patient comfort in order to minimize the potential for inaccurate reporting. Since only the victims were interviewed, we relied on the victims' perceptions of whether their assailants were substance using during the episodes. Another limitation is the limited data collected in the survey instrument on victimization. The terminology of the questions and the limited questions on assault may have resulted in underreporting. However, unless the degree of underreporting differed by gender, it would not bias estimates of the association between gender and substance use during assault. An additional limitation of the data was that detail was not obtained regarding recurrent episodes of violence throughout the lifetime, which could involve different assailants and different relationships. Future exploration about the social contexts where substance involved violence occurs will help clarify these issues. Additionally, since lifetime experience of violence was measured, it is not possible to distinguish whether violence occurred before or after HIV infection. mv-infected persons have high prevalence of lifetime violence, which has been shown to negatively impact their physical and mental health status. This study demonstrated that substance use by both the victim and the assailant during cases of physical and sexual assault is very common in this HIV -infected sample. Furthermore, women were at even higher risk than men for substance-involved sexual assault. The reasons for these differences need to be further investigated. Whether these episodes of violence are occurring before or after HIV diagnosis is also deserving of further study. Such information can help guide the incorpora\u00ad tion of violence prevention into substance abuse treatment programs aimed at Hlv-infected individuals. Education about the risks of violence, techniques to avoid situations that could potentially lead to violence, as well as screening for violence and its sequelae are important issues in the substance abuse management of HIV-infected individuals.

PERNA, Ed.D., Ph.D.2 ABSTRACT Background and objectives: Clinical depression affects millions of women annually. Exercise has been studied as a potential antidepressant, with most studies supporting its efficacy. Ex\u00ad ercise also has the potential to reduce the risk for physical comorbidities that occur with de\u00ad pression. However, less is known about the types of exercise programs to which women with depressive symptoms will adhere. Our objectives were to (1) compare two exercise programs, varying in their degree of structure, on improvements in physical activity and (2) compare the two exercise interventions on depressive symptoms, body composition, and fitness. Methods: Women with depressive symptoms (physician diagnosed and confirmed with the Beck Depression Inventory) residing in the greater Boston area were recruited for this 3-month intervention study. Continuous enrollment took place between November 2005 and Novem\u00ad ber 2006. Women were randomly assigned to either a clinic-based or home-based exercise in\u00ad tervention, with assessments at baseline and 3-months. Results: Participants (n =32) were predominantly minority (81.4%) and, at baseline, had moderate symptoms of depression (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI], mean =25.6, SD =9.3), and were sedentary (mean = 35.8 min/week of moderate and vigorous activity, SD = 31.4). Gain scores for depressive symptoms (clinic-based mean = -11.7, home-based mean = -9.7) and physical mean =39.0) strong im\u00ad provements across time. analyses on 3-month data show that both interven\u00ad tions were associated with improvements in time spent in physical activity and depressive symptoms. Neither intervention impacted body composition or fitness. Conclusions: Both exercise programs were associated with reductions in depressive symp\u00ad toms and increased physical activity participation, suggesting that even a home-based pro\u00ad gram can benefit women with depressive symptoms.

Although much of the early research in this area was criticized as suffering from a vari\u00ad ety of methodological flaws (e.g., small samples, lack of random assignment, lack of control groups), current researchers have addressed these design issues, and there are at present mul\u00ad tiple studies using experimental designs or ran\u00ad domized clinical trial (RCT) approaches that demonstrate the antidepressant effects of exer\u00ad 14 cise.7\u00ad Meta-analytic findings indicate tha t exercise in\u00ad te:ventions have a large impact on depression, WIth between-groups effect sizes (ES), ranging from -0.72 to -1.4.15-18 Further, exercise is ef\u00ad fective for a variety of patient subgroups.l\" That is, patients with both moderate and more severe depression appear to benefit similarly. Exercise efficacy is comparable to and not Significantly dif\u00ad ferent from psychotherapy and pharmacological treatment. 15,18 Meta-analytic studies suggest that fitness gains are not necessary to achieve reduc\u00ad tions in depression and that exercise program characteristics, such as duration, intensity, fre\u00ad quency, and mode of exercise, do not moderate th~ ef~e.ct. The length of the exercise program is a significant moderator, however, with programs 9 weeks or longer associated with larger reduc\u00ad tio~ in depression.l'' Conversely, emerging ex\u00ad penmental research demonstrates that a dose-re\u00ad sponse relationship may exist, with more exercise ~ssoci~ted with larger reductions in depression, implying that exercise characteristics such as fre\u00ad quency, duration, and intensity may be impor\u00ad ~ant.1O,1.4 Few studies to date have directly exam\u00ad ined this, and more research is needed; however, extant findings do suggest that exercise need not be lengthy or intense to promote positive changes in depressive symptoms. It may be the case that individuals who can exercise at public health rec\u00ad ommended doses will experience even larger benefits. CRAFT ET AL. Implementing exercise into treatment A poorly understood area within this body of research relates to how extensive an intervention need be to promote exercise adherence. Re\u00ad searchers examining the antidepressant effects of exercise have predominantly used supervised, hospital-based exercise protocols, with fewer studies using home-based programs. However, in the general population, long-term adherence to exercise programs has been improved with the use of home-based or community-based pro\u00ad grams, the addition of exercise adherence supportive follow-up d th .tac . t eep10g 10 min e time constraints of clinicians, it remains unclear how much infor\u00ad mation, counseling, and contact are necessary to help women with depressive symptoms initiate and maintain an exercise program as a treatment component for reducing the severity of symp\u00ad toms. Further, exercise adherence may be a nee\u00ad e~sary factor not only for a reduction in depres\u00ad srve symptoms but also for the physical health benefits that exercise can provide in reducing risk for the development of physical comorbidities. Therefore, the primary purpose of the present pi\u00ad lot study was to compare two types of exercise pro\u00ad grams, varying in their degree of supervision and stru~~re,. on improvements in physical activity participation. A secondary aim was to compare the two exercise interventions on depressive symp\u00ad toms, body composition, and fitness. Further, be\u00ad cause minority enrollment in previous RCTs of ex\u00ad ercise and depression has been minimal, we specifically targeted urban minority women with depression from a community hospital for this study. It is predicted that women in both clinic\u00ad ~ased an~ h~~e-based exercise groups will expe\u00ad nence a significant reduction in depression. Fur\u00ad ther, it is hypothesized that a clinic-based exercise intervention that includes cognitive behavioral techniques (e.g., self-monitoring, goal setting) to enhance exercise adherence will be superior to a home-based intervention in promoting physical ac\u00ad tivity participation, reducing depressive symp\u00ad toms, decreasing body fat, and increasing cardio\u00ad vascular fitness at 3-month follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thispilot study was a randomized trial of two ex\u00ad ercise strategies targeting low-income, urban, EXERCISE AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS nority women. Participantswere stratifiedby ~~t depression treatment (i.e., no treatment, medication only, therapy only, medicati?n plus ~~rapy) and then randomly assigned to either a clinic-based or home-based exercise intervention with assessments at baseline and 3 months. Assessments consisted of a symptom-limited graded exercise ~t on ~ ~ead\u00ad call, pedometer counts, and a psychosocial survey. Participants Prior to data collection, all participants signed an informed consent statement as approved by the Institutional Review Board at Boston Univer\u00ad sity. Participants were recruited through The Center for Excellence in Women's Health, Fam\u00ad ily Medicine, and posted fliers on the Boston Uni\u00ad versity Medical Center (BUMC) Campus. Re\u00ad cruitment took place continuously over a 12-month period. Eligibility criteria included (1) English speaking, (2) age b~m.:een 18 ~nd 55 years, (3) meeting DSM-IV cntena for Major De\u00ad pression, Dysthymia, or Depressive Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified as diagnosed by a primary care physician and scoring >9 on the Beck De\u00ad pression Inventory-If (BDI-II), (4) sedentary lifestyle (i.e., exercise less than 3 times/week for >30 minutes per session in last 6 months), and (5) average or below average level of fitness as determined by graded exercise testing. Exclusion criteria included (1) diagnosed coronary heart disease (CHD), (2) insulin-requiring diabetes identified by patient self-report, (3) self-reported comorbid mental health diagnosis (e.g., anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and (4) any contraindication to exercise determined by the physician supervising the exercise stress test. Further, for women taking antidepressant med\u00ad ication or receiving psychotherapy, study entry was delayed until they had been taking their medication or seeing a therapist for at least 8 weeks. Finally, all women in the study were re\u00ad quired to obtain medical clearance t? exer~ise an.d physician confirmation of depr~sslOn diagnos~s prior to enrollment. Enrollment mto the study IS outlined in Figure 1. Ultimately, 32 women en\u00ad rolled in this longitudinal pilot study, and sam\u00ad ple characteristics are presented in Table 1. Instruments Demographic questionnaire. All participants completed a basic demographic questionnaire that assessed variables, including age, marital sta\u00ad tus, race, family income level, medical history, and current treatment for depression. Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). ~e BDI-II is a reliable, valid, and widely used 21-Item self\u00ad report inventory designed to asses~ the sever.ity of clinical depression and changes In depressive symptoms across time.29 This ~nventory h~s demonstrated good internal consistency and IS widely used to assess changes in depressive symptoms across time. For each item, the partic\u00ad ipant is asked to choose, from a list of statements, the one statement that best reflects the way she has been feeling during the past 2 weeks. State\u00ad ments are organized according to severity and rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicative of more severe symp\u00ad toms. Cutoff points for scoring the inventory are: <14, minimal depression; score <9 indicates that the de\u00ad pression is in remission. None of the study participants scored <9 on the BDI-II at study en\u00ad try. Internal consistency for this sample was ~c\u00ad ceptable, with Cronbach's ex = 0.83 at at 3-month follow-up. Body mass index (BMV. A standard, regularly calibrated hospital scale and stadiometer were used to assess weight and height. Participants were asked to remove their shoes and heavy outer clothing prior to stepping on the scale. BMI was calculated at each visit as [weight (kg)/ height (m2) ] . Body composition assessment. To assess body composition, each participant underwent a whole body scan using a Hologic QDR-4500 dual-energy x-ray absorptiometer (DEXA) (Ho\u00ad provides a quick, noninvasive, hi~hly accurat.e percentage of body fat and is considered a rel~\u00ad able method of determination of body compOSI\u00ad tion. The test-retest reliability of the DEXA has been demonstrated with coefficients of variation (CVs) over a 5- to 7-day period of 1.6%, which is similar to underwater weighing and bioelec\u00ad trical impedance. DEXA is also considered a valid assessment of body composition, as it is highly correlated with underwater weighing, the current gold standard in assessing body composition (r = 0.87).30 1502 CRAFf ET AL.

Physicians mon\u00ad itoring exercise tests were blinded to participant group assignment. A 12-lead EeG and a Physio\u00ad Dyne metabolic cart (Quoque, NY) were used to determine peak heart rate, peak oxygen con\u00ad sumption (Vo2 peak), total work, time on test, and suitability for exercise. V02 peak served as the pri\u00ad mary fitness marker in this study. The 7-day physical activity recall (PAR). The PAR31 is a widely used and well-validated brief self-report recall assessing the frequency, dura\u00ad tion, and intensity of physical activity, and it yields several physical activity indexes (minutes of exercise at each level of exercise intensity, num\u00ad ber of days exercised, and a rough estimate of caloric expenditure over the week). The PAR is administered in a semistructured interview for\u00ad mat, with the administrator probing for activity 1503 EXERCISE AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS TABLE 1.

Pedometer counts. Pedometers provide an un\u00ad obtrusive, lightweight, and widely used method to objectively monitor physical activity. The Yamax Digi-Walker SW-701 pedometer (Tokyo, Japan) was used in this study and previously has been found suitable for research purposes/\" Reliabil\u00ad ity of the Yamax Digi-Walker is reported at a = 0.99, and when compared with actual steps taken at five different speeds on a treadmill, the Yamax Digi-Walker was accurate within \u00b11% of actual steps taken.34,35 Each month, participants were contacted and asked to reset the pedometer and to wear the pedometer for 7 consecutive days for data collection purposes. Participants then re\u00ad ported steps taken per day via telephone contact with study staff or in person at the time of their 3-month assessment. Average steps and distance (miles) per day were used as our objective phys\u00ad ical activity outcome measures. 1504 Intervention groups Clinic-based intervention. At study entry, those assigned to the clinic-based exercise ~oup w~re provided assessment feedback and information on how exercise may help with symptoms of de\u00ad pression. Further, they were given an individu\u00ad alized moderate-intensity walking program based on exercise testing results. They then par\u00ad ticipated in a 4-week clinic-based training phase during which they came to the medical center twice weekly for exercise training and were asked to complete one exercise session weekly at home. During laboratory training, exercise duration and intensity were gradually increased according to participant comfort, with the ultimate goal of walking 30-40 minutes in a training zone of 60'1'0-80% maximal heart rate (MHR). Following this 4-week phase, ercise group members were transitioned to the home-based phase of the study and were asked to continue the walking program at home for the remaining 8 weeks of the study. Participants re\u00ad ceived a pedometer and instructions on its use for self-monitoring (i.e., exercise calendar and goal\u00ad setting information) and data collection pur\u00ad poses. Once each month, pedometer and physi\u00ad cal activity recall measures of physical activity were collected. In addition, women in this group received up to four 30-minute adherence coun\u00ad seling sessions to aid in adherence to the clinic\u00ad based exercise, transition to home-based exercise, and maintenance of exercise during follow-up. Participants also received biweekly, brief sup\u00ad portive follow-up contact via telephone to en\u00ad courage continued exercise participation, set new exercise and pedometer goals, and brainstorm so\u00ad lutions to new barriers encountered. The average number of laboratory-based exercise sessions completed by clinic-based group participants was 6.2 of a possible 8, or 77.5%. There were no ad\u00ad verse events reported by women in the clinic\u00ad based group. Home-based exercise intervention. Those assigned to the home-based exercise group were also pro\u00ad vided assessment feedback, information on how exercise may help with symptoms of depression, and a generic exercise prescription reflective of a moderate-intensity walking program. Partici\u00ad pants then attended one clinic-based personal\u00ad ized (individual) instructional session at the med\u00ad ical center, during which they were acclimated to CRAFT ET AL. walking on a treadmill at various exercise inten\u00ad sities and were instructed on how to use the Rat\u00ad ing of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale to monitor and adjust exercise intensity. Each woman re\u00ad ceived a pedometer and information on its u~e for data collection purposes. Members of this group were asked to exercise at home f~r the du\u00ad ration of the study (home-based exercise only), following the exercise prescription provided. Once each month, these women were contacted to gather pedometer and physical activity recall data. These phone conversations were limited to data collection and brief \"Do your best\" state\u00ad ments regarding exercise participation. Similar to the clinic-based group, participants in the home\u00ad based exercise intervention did not report any ad\u00ad verse events. Analysis Descriptive statistics were computed for study variables. To check for preexisting group differ\u00ad ences at study entry despite randomization, t tests for continuous variables and chi-square analyses for categorical variables were conducted on descriptive variables and outcome measures. Because some participants missed follow-up assessments and intent-to-treat analyses are the recommended approach, we chose to impute missing values. Mean substitution is the most conservative method of estimating missing data. Replacing the missing value with a group mean (i.e., clinic-based group mean or home-based group mean) is less conservative than using an overall grand mean, but the reduction in within\u00ad groups variance can result in spuriously large between-groups differences.P\" A regression ap\u00ad proach is more widely applicable and recom\u00ad mended over mean replacement when significant models can be produced. In this method, other variables are used as the independent variables (IV) to predict the missing values or dependent variables (DV). For example, if a 3-month de\u00ad pression score is missing, then baseline depres\u00ad sion score, baseline age, ethnicity, and other val\u00ad ues are used as predictors (IV) of the 3-month score (DV). Cases with complete values are used to generate the regression equation. The pre\u00ad dicted values resulting from the regression equa\u00ad tion are imputed for missing values, and all cases are used in a second regression. This continues until the predicted values from one step converge with those of the following step, and the predic\u00ad1505 EXERCISE AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS tions from the last round are used as the estimates of the missing values.i\" The final step is to com\u00ad pare the concordance between these two meth\u00ad ods (group mean replacement and regression modeling) of estimation.i'\" These two methods generated estimates that were highly correlated (r = 0.70-0.99), and yielded the same result regarding interpretation of statistical significance, with the exception of BMI, percent fat, and cardiovascular fitness data. For those variables, significant findings emerged when using mean replacement but not when us\u00ad ing regression modeling estimates. However, re\u00ad gression equations 99.1%, 96.9%, and 86.9%of the variance in BMI, percent fat, and fitness, respectively. Thus, the regression model\u00ad ing approach to impute missing values was deemed the more appropriate choice, and re\u00ad ported findings are based on those estimates. Relationships among variables at study entry and 3-month follow-up were investigated with Pearson's correlations. Overall effect sizes (Co\u00ad hen's d) for depression for each exercise group were calculated. Gain scores (3 month-baseline) were calculated to demonstrate change in out\u00ad comes over time (Table 2). To examine potential group differences at 3-month follow-up on de\u00ad pression, time spent in physical activity, BMI, percent fat, and fitness, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted. Baseline scores and three demographic variables (age, ethnicity, and education) served as covariates in these analyses. Finally, pedometers were dispensed with after the baseline assessment; as a result, there are no true baseline pedometer data. However, to in\u00ad vestigate group differences in average steps and distance walked per day and to corroborate self\u00ad reported activity data at 3-month follow-up, an independent samples t-test was conducted on 3\u00ad month pedometer data. RESULTS For demographic variables of interest, baseline differences emerged between groups for three variables: ethnicity, education, and sleep diffi\u00ad culty (Table 1). There were no statistically signif\u00ad icant differences between groups at baseline on outcome variables of interest: depression, time spent in moderate and vigorous physical activity, BMI, percent body fat, or fitness (all p > 0.05). Means and SDs for dependent variables at baseline and 3-month follow-up are presented in Table 2. Overall ESs for exercise effects on de\u00ad pressive symptoms in this sample were large in both groups (clinic-based -1.3, home-based -0.97). Of the total sample, 46.9% (15 of 32) of participants experienced a ::::::50% reduction in de\u00ad pressive symptoms. Further, 31.3% of the sample (to of 32) achieved remission of their symptoms (BDIscore <9).Gain scores for depressive symp\u00ad toms (clinic-based mean = -11.7, home-based M = -9.7) and physical activity (clinic-based mean = 65.4, home-based mean = 39.0 mini week) indicated strong improvements across time for both groups (Table 2). Objective moni\u00ad toring of physical activity by pedometer counts shows that at 3 months, clinic-based group mem\u00ad bers accumulated more steps and walked further each day (steps: mean = 7036.8,SD = 2259.8;dis\u00ad tance: mean = 2.9 miles, SD = 0.9) than those in the home-based group (Steps: mean = 4957.6, SD = 2239.1; distance: mean = 2.1 miles, SD = 1.0). The between-groups difference was signifi\u00ad cant for both steps and distance (steps: t(29) = -2.6, P < 0.05; distance: t(29) = -2.5, P < 0.05). At baseline and at three months, BMI was sig\u00ad nificantly correlated with percent body fat (r = 0.68 and r = 0.71, both P < 0.001) and fitness (r = -0.69 and r = 0.70, both P < 0.001). Similarly, percent body fat was inversely correlated with fit\u00ad ness (r = -0.54 and r = -0.53, both P < 0.01). At 3 months, average pedometer steps per day were significantly correlated with BMI (r = -0.41, P< 0.05), fitness (r = 0.41, P < 0.05), and time spent in physical activity (r = 0.46, P < 0.01). Likewise, average distance walked per day, as assessed by the pedometer, was significantly correlated with BMI (r = -0.41, P < 0.05), fitness (r = 0.39, P< 0.05), and time spent in activity (r = 0.45, P< 0.05). All other correlations between depression, time spent in physical activity, fitness, and indi\u00ad cators of body composition at baseline and 3\u00ad month follow-up were nonsignificant (all p > 0.05). Based on ANCOV A results, there were no sig\u00ad nificant differences at 3-month follow-up be\u00ad tween groups on BDI-II depression score, after controlling for baseline BDI score and demo\u00ad graphic variables [F(l,30) = 0.01, P = 0.93]. Simi\u00ad larly, groups did not differ significantly on self\u00ad reported time spent in moderate and vigorous activity, after controlling for baseline activity level and the demographic variables [F(l,30) = 1.2, P = 0.28]. ANCOV A for BMI, body fat, and TABLE 2.

Both clinic-based and home\u00ad based exercise groups similarly improved their self-reported physical activity from baseline to 3\u00ad month follow-up, but clinic-based group partici\u00ad pants had significantly higher objectively as\u00ad sessed (pedometer) physical activity. We found that pedometer data, but not self-reported phys\u00ad ical activity recall, were significantly associated with fitness (Vo2) and body composition (BMI). With the exception of pedometer steps, however, there were no significant between-group effects at 3-month follow-up for depressive symptoms, self-reported physical activity, body composition, or cardiorespiratory fitness. The findings that the clinic-based, more time\u00ad intensive exercise intervention was associated with significantly more objectively assessed physical activity than the home-based condition and that both interventions were associated with increases in time spent in physical activity, but not with improvements in fitness and body com\u00ad position, warrant further comment. The lack of impact on physical health outcomes in clinic\u00ad based participants may be because the leading supervised phase was only 1 month in length. It is interesting to note that during the clinic-based phase, the majority of participants were able to meet the goal of walking 30-45 minutes in a train\u00ad ing zone of 60%--85% MHR. Also, whereas clinic\u00ad based group members made significant gains in time spent in physical activity, they did not main\u00ad tain exercise at a duration or intensity necessary to promote positive changes in body composition and fitness once they were transitioned to the home-based phase. Therefore, the observed in\u00ad crease in activity may reflect an incorporation of activity into daily routines rather than an increase in sustained activity intended to increase cardio\u00ad vascular fitness or promote a reduction in body fat. It is also possible that 3 months is not an ad\u00ad equate length of time to see changes in these spe\u00ad cific variables. Continued exercise involvement beyond the 3-month follow-up may cause fitness and body composition improvements. Similarly, whereas those in the clinic-based group walked significantly more than those in the home-based group (based on pedometer counts), they did not experience significantly larger re\u00ad ductions in the symptoms of their depression. Emerging research suggests a dose-response re\u00ad lationship between exercise and a reduction in depressive symptoms,1O,14 although few studies have directly examined a potential dose-response gradient, and more research in the area is needed. Therefore, although our data do not support a dose-response relationship, our findings are con\u00ad sistent with previous research suggesting that exercise involvement in a nondose-dependent manner is sufficient to reduce depressive symp\u00ad toms. 7-9,13 As mentioned previously, in the general pop\u00ad ulation, exercise adherence is improved among those involved in home-based or community\u00ad based activities.21,23,26,27 Therefore, the long-term goal of having women exercise in their commu\u00ad nities rather than coming to the hospital to exer\u00ad cise remains an important one. Our findings sug\u00ad gest that a home-based program was as effective in promoting activity involvement and reducing depressive symptoms as a clinic-based interven\u00ad tion. Future researchers should examine whether the initial supervised phase should be length\u00ad ened, if additional exercise adherence counseling sessions are required, or if direct supervision in the community for a period of time after the tran\u00ad sition is beneficial in promoting compliance. There are several limitations to the current study that should be considered when interpret\u00ad ing results. First, this was a pilot study, and we employed a small sample size. Consequently, we may not have had adequate statistical power to detect group differences on all outcome mea\u00ad sures. Our findings should be replicated in a larger sample. Second, we did not employ a true control group, and, thus, it is impossible to say that the reduction in depressive symptoms ob\u00ad served among the women in this study was caused by exercise. It is plausible that the im\u00ad provement in depressive symptoms could reflect the passage of time or the effects of other de\u00ad pression treatments. None of the women in the study initiated, changed (dosage of medication, 1508 frequency of therapy), or discontinued either pharmacological or psychological therapies dur\u00ad ing the trial, and it is impossible to tease out these potential effects. However, our intervention ESs are consistent with the vast majority of results from exercise and depression studies that support exercise as an effective antidepressant. It is also noteworthy that approximately half the sample experienced at least a 50% reduction in their de\u00ad pressive symptoms. Third, although this is the first intervention study of which we are aware that included a large percentage of minority wo\u00ad men, the majority of minority women enrolled in this study were of African American descent, and other racial! ethnic groups were underrepre\u00ad sented. Social and cultural factors may differ among various ethnic groups and, as a result, have a differing impact on the course of depres\u00ad sion, use of traditional treatments for depression, and interest in exercise as a treatment option. Fourth, we compared only two types of exercise interventions. Programs that include and pro\u00ad mote community involvement may be preferred and may be more appropriate for minority wo\u00ad men in particular, resulting in better compliance to the exercise prescription.'? CONCLUSIONS Both a home-based and more intensive struc\u00ad tured (clinic-based) exercise intervention were as\u00ad sociated with improvements in time spent in moderate and vigorous physical activity and a re\u00ad duction in depressive symptoms at 3-month fol\u00ad low-up. This suggests that basic information and contact, as was provided to the home-based group, can promote the initiation of an exercise program. An encouraging implication of this finding may be that even a minimal intervention can prompt women with depressive symptoms to initiate an exercise program. Home-based par\u00ad ticipants were provided one primary exercise ses\u00ad sion, a pedometer, and a monthly call. These ef\u00ad forts required minimal time and may be enough to promote exercise at a sufficient level to reduce depression, although these are likely significant enhancements to the usual standard care. Future research is needed to determine what types of in\u00ad terventions will promote long-term compliance at an appropriate frequency, duration, and intensity that would also result in positive changes in body composition and fitness.

Kressin2,3 1Department of Dental Public Health Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, USA, 2Department of Veterans Affairs, Bedford, MA, USA and3Boston University School of Public Health, MA, USA Chronic periodontitis has been repor- ted to be asymptomatic during most ofits course, with clinical signs, such asperiodontal pockets, being generallypainless (1). Because chronic perio-dontitis is believed to be asymptomaticin its initial stages, it has been sugges-ted that individuals may be unaware oftheir clinical periodontal status (2-4)and underestimate what treatments arerequired, as judged by dental profes- sionals (5). In its more advanced sta- ges, chronic periodontitis can beassociated with signs and symptomsthat are readily perceivable by indi-viduals, ofanterior interproximal papillae, or discomfort (6,7). Various tools and methods have been developed to assess the impact ofdental diseases on the oral health-rela-ted quality of life as perceived by theaected individual. Two such distinctmethods include a self-report of oralhealth, typically assessed by a singlequestion (subsequently referred to asthe perceived oral health), and a self- report on oral symptoms and functions as assessed by a battery of questions(subsequently referred to as oralhealth-related quality of life). Surveysin the community and clinical settingshave used these measures to describethe oral health from an individual perspective (7-15). Improvements onboth the way individuals rate their oralhealth and the oral health-relatedquality of life of patients under treat-ment are desirable outcomes of dentaltreatments (16). Such measures areincreasingly being used in clinical trialsas subjective true end points (17-22). In terms of these patient-oriented outcomes, little is known about their frequency among periodontal patients or their relationship to clinical signs ofperiodontal diseases. The aim of thisstudy was to describe the perceivedoral health, the oral health-relatedquality of life and the association ofCunha-Cruz J, Hujoel PP, Kressin NR.

Journal compilation /C2112007 Blackwell Munksgaard Background and Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the oral health- related quality of life of patients presenting to a periodontal specialist by means of six questions, and to assess the perceived oral health by means of one question. Self-assessments of oral health were associated with clinical characteristics. Material and Methods: Logistic regression models were used to associate self- assessments with clinical characteristics in a cross-sectional study. Results: On the six-item questionnaire, close to 20% (295/1480) of the patients reported that teeth, gums or dentures had an impact fairly often or very often onone or more items (eating, relaxing, avoiding going out, feeling self-conscious, pain or discomfort). On the single question requesting a self-assessment of oral health, 42% (628/1468) rated their oral health as fair or poor. Both common oral health-related quality of life problems and worse perceived oral health were associatedwith having more than eight teeth with >5 mm periodontal pockets (oddsratio\u00bc1.45, 95% condence ratio \u00bc2.83, 95% condence interval \u00bc2.08-3.84, respectively), compared with patients who had fewer than three teeth with >5 mm periodontal pockets. Conclusion: Oral health-related problems in patients presenting to a periodontal specialist oce negatively aect their quality of life. If some of the ndings of thisstudy can be conrmed in other studies, it could change the perception of chronicperiodontitis as a silent disease.Joana Cunha-Cruz/Philippe Hujoel, University of Washington, Dental Public Health Sciences,B509, 1959 NE Pacific Street, Box 357475, Seattle, WA 5, Res 2007; 42; 169-176 All rights reserved /C2112007 Journal /C2112007 Blackwell Munksgaard JOURNAL OF PERIO DONTAL RESEARCH doi:10.1111/j.1600-0765.2006.00930.xthese two subjective assessments with clinical characteristics among patientspresenting to a periodontal specialist. Subjects and methods The study population consisted of members of the Washington Dental Service presenting for a comprehensiveinitial clinical examination by a perio-dontal specialist. A total of 3617 indi-viduals were invited to participate inthe study; 1497 patients consented toparticipate and mailed back the ques-tionnaire during the period from Feb-ruary 2003 to October 2004 (41%response rate). The protocol of thestudy was approved by the Institu-tional Review Board of the University of Washington. Patients' characteristics were obtained from a mailed questionnaire,which included questions on age,smoking, diabetes status, perceivedoral health (one question) and oralhealth-related quality of life (six ques-tions). Gender was obtained fromadministrative data. Number of teethwith at least one periodontal pocketdeeper than 5 mm and 8 mm, and number of missing teeth were abstrac- ted from the dental charts. Perceived oral health was measured by a single question /C212How would you describe the health of your teeth andgums? /C213where the possible answers were: excellent, very good, good, fairand poor. Patients reporting fair orpoor oral health were considered ashaving worse perceived oral health. Oral health-related quality of life was measured by a short oral health- related quality of life questionnaireconsisting of six questions about the impact of teeth, gums and dentures oneating, relaxing, avoiding going out,feeling self-conscious or painand denture discomfort (Table 1).Patients who answered either fairlyoften or very often; always; or either quite a bit or a great deal to one or more of the six questions were consid-ered as having common oral health-related quality of life problems. The oral health-related quality of life questionnaire was developed by Kres-sin and colleagues (unpublished),based on a conceptual model of oralhealth and quality of life which positedthat the dimensions of physical func-tion, social role function, distress,worry, denture discomfort and impairment/disease were the six most important areas that could be impactedby decrements in oral health. Theytested this model empirically, usingdata previously collected from twosamples of older male veterans (totaln\u00bc816), which included three oral health-related quality of life indices -the Oral Health Impact Prole (23), theGeriatric Oral Health AssessmentIndex (24) and the Oral Health-related Quality of Life measure (25). They assigned each item from the threescales to the dimension it best repre-sented, and then, using factor analysisand multitrait analyses, pared downthe number of items by eliminatingitems whose deletion least aected theinternal consistency reliability of thescales. At the same time, they sought toretain the items which they considered,from a conceptual standpoint, to best represent the subscale. Ultimately, the brief oral health-related quality of lifequestionnaire consisted of a six-item measure representing six oral health-related quality of life dimensions inwhich four of these items were from theOral Health Impact Prole question-naire; one was from the Geriatric OralHealth Assessment Index; and one was from the Oral Health-related Quality of Life measure (Table 1). Reliabilityand validity of the new questionnairewere tested and the brief oral health-related quality of life questionnairepresented good internal consistency(Cronbach's alpha \u00bc0.80) and con- vergent validity, as measured by correlation with number ofteeth, coronal and root dental caries,and periodontal status from the twosamples of older male veterans. Statistical analysis The distribution of perceived oralhealth and each impact (i.e. each item)of the oral health-related quality of lifeinstrument were examined using des-criptive statistics. In the main analysis,logistic regression models were used torelate both worse perceived oral healthand common oral health-related qual- ity of life problems to number of teeth with pockets deeper than 5 mm (0-2,3-4, 5-8, 9-30 teeth), number of teethwith pockets deeper than of teeth (seeTable 2 for categories). In a secondaryanalysis, logistic regression was used torelate each impact (item) of the oral health-related quality of life question- naire with the clinical characteristics of Table 1.

Given the exploratory nature of this latter analysis, we reportonly those results where the lower limitof the condence interval is 2. In addition to the clinical characteristics,the multivariate models included agegroups (35 to < 49, 49 to < 54, 54 to < 60, 60-89 years old), gender (male, female), smoking status (never, former,current), diabetes status (yes, no) andpartial denture use (yes, no). Results Participants presenting for an initialperiodontal examination and consent-ing to participate were 35-89 and 42.9% were current and former smok-ers, respectively. Fourteen per cent ofthe patients reported using some typeof removable dentures. In general,patients had 6.1 teeth with periodontalpockets than 5 mm (standarddeviation \u00bc5.6) [1.2 (standard devi- ation\u00bc2.3) in the anterior teeth and 4.9 (standard deviation \u00bc3.9) in the posterior teeth]. The mean number of teeth with periodontal pockets deeper than 8 mm was 0.7 (standard devi-ation\u00bc1.4) [0.1 (standard devi- ation\u00bc0.5) in the anterior teeth and 0.6 (standard deviation \u00bc1.2) in the posterior teeth]. On average, patientshad 7.1 missing teeth (standard devi-ation\u00bc4.8) [0.8 missing anterior teeth (standard deviation \u00bc1.9) and 6.1 missing posterior teeth (standard devi-ation\u00bc3.0)]. Perceived oral health Only 1.9% of the patients rated their oral health as excellent; 14.1% ratedtheir oral health as very good, 40.2%as good, 34.5% as fair and 7.4% aspoor (28 participants did not answerthis question). A total of 41.9% of thesample indicated that their oral healthwas in the /C212worst /C213category (fair or poor).

Periodontal pockets > 8 mm and worse perceived oral health \u2014 The unadjusted odds for worse perceived oral health increased by 228% for patients who had3 teeth with pockets deeper than 8 mm compared to patients withoutpockets > 8 mm (odds ratio \u00bc3.28; 95% condence interval \u00bc2.10-5.14). After adjustment, this associationremained the analyses to anterior orposterior teeth, posterior teeth withpockets > 8 mm was associated withworse perceived oral health (Table 2). Missing teeth and worse perceived oral health \u2014 When compared with pa- tients who had 0-3 missing teeth,having 4-7, 8-11 or 12 missing teeth increased the unadjusted odds of worseperceived oral health by confounding, all levels of missing teeth (4-7, 8-11 and 12) remained signicantly associated with worse perceived oral health.When restricting the analyses toanterior or posterior teeth, the numberof posterior missing teeth was associ-ated with worse perceived oral health(Table 2).Common oral health-related quality of life problems: one or more outof six problems with a poor rating Almost 20% of the patients had one or more items endorsed as having prob-lems fairly often or very often witheating, relaxing, avoiding going out, feeling self-conscious, denture discom- fort or pain caused by teeth, gums anddentures (i.e. common oral health-related quality of life problems)(Table 3). Of these patients, 11.1%reported one problem, 5.7% reportedtwo problems, 1.8% reported threeproblems and 1.2% reported four tosix problems. Periodontal pockets > 5 mm and com- mon oral health-related quality of lifeproblems \u2014 Having 9 teeth with pockets deeper than 5 mm increased by45% the unadjusted odds of commonoral health-related quality of lifeproblems compared with patients who had 0-2 teeth with pockets > 5 mm (odds ratio \u00bc1.45; 95% condence interval \u00bc1.01-2.08). Compared with patients who had 0-2 teeth withpockets > 5 mm, the unadjusted oddsof common oral health-related qualityof life problems were not statisticallydierent between patients who had 3-4teeth with pockets > 5 mm (oddsratio\u00bc1.00; 95% condence inter- val\u00bc0.67-1.50) or 5-8 teeth with pockets 5 mm (odds ratio \u00bc0.86; 95% condence interval \u00bc0.59-1.27).Adjustment for confounding increased the magnitude of the association bet-ween 9 teeth with pockets > 5 mm and frequent oral health-related qual-ity of life (odds ratio \u00bc1.59; 95% condence interval \u00bc1.07-2.35). The number of anterior and posterior teeth with pockets > 5 mm were also asso- ciated with common oral health-rela-ted quality of life problems (Table 4). Periodontal pockets > 8 mm and common oral health-related quality oflife problems \u2014 Compared with no pockets > 8 mm, the unadjusted oddsof common oral health-related qualityof life problems increased by 67% forpatients who had 3 teeth with pockets > 8 mm (odds ratio \u00bc1.67; 95% condence interval \u00bc1.04-2.68).

When restricting to anterior or posterior missing teeth,posterior missing teeth was associatedwith frequent self-consciousness(Table 5). Missing teeth was associated with denture discomfort. Patients with 8-11and12 missing teeth had higher odds of frequent denture discomfort thanpatients with 0-3 missing teeth for confounding. Whenrestricting to anterior and posteriormissing teeth, both anterior andposterior missing teeth were associated with frequent denture discomfort(Table 5). Discussion The ndings of this study indicate that42% of the patients reported either fairor poor oral health when a simplequestion was asked with regard to theperception of the conditions of their teeth and gums. In addition, one in ve periodontal patients reported frequentepisodes of one or more oral health-related quality of life problems whensix questions related to their teeth,gums and dentures were posed. Therelationships of periodontal pocketsand missing teeth with both perceived oral health and oral health-relatedquality of life self-assessments were notsimple linear associations. Many patients were not satised with the health of their teeth and gums;almost half rated their oral health as fair or poor. It is important to note that these periodontal patients are notnecessarily rating their oral healthworse than the general population. Ourndings were similar to national Uni-ted States estimates, where 36% and44% of adults 40-64 years and> 65 years rated their oral health asfair or poor, respectively (15). About one-fth of this population of periodontal patients reported one ormore frequent adverse impacts in their quality of life caused by teeth, gums or dentures. This gure is similar to esti-mates from national surveys in the UKand Australia, where 16% and 18% ofadults reported at least one oral health-related quality of life adverse impactoccurring very or fairly often (26). Thethree most commonly reported prob-lems were pain, diculty relaxing anddenture discomfort. These ndingssuggest that not only the physical functioning, but also pleasurable life experiences, such as relaxation andsocial interaction, can be aected by theoral conditions of periodontal patients. There was not a simple linear rela- tionship between the number of deeppockets, the number of missing teethand the self-assessed oral health meas-ures. For periodontal pockets, oralhealth-related quality of life and per-ceived oral health was only aected when multiple teeth were involved (generalized periodontitis?). In con-trast, the presence of a few periodontalpockets (localized periodontitis?) didnot influence the oral health-relatedquality of life or the perceived oralhealth. In a study in England, oralhealth-related quality of life was foundto be linearly associated with perio-dontal pockets 5 mm or deeper ofpatients either at an initial examination or during the maintenance phase of the periodontal treatment (7), a nding wefailed to duplicate.

In contrast with localized chronic periodontitis, patients with generalizedforms of chronic periodontitis may bemore likely to have noticeable signsand symptoms, such as tooth mobilityand unaesthetic loss of anterior inter-proximal papillae, which may bedriving the observed poor oral health-related quality of life and worseperceived oral health. These ndings suggest that chronic periodontitis may interfere with the social life of perio-dontitis patients and challenge theperception of chronic periodontitis as asilent disease. In addition, the lack oflinear correspondence between thecurrent objective measure of perio-dontal diseases (i.e. periodontal pock-ets) and oral health-related quality oflife or perceived oral health mayencourage clinicians and investigators to make use of outcomes more mean- ingful to their patients by addingtogether traditional clinical indicatorsand subjective indicators to assessperiodontal needs and evaluate treat-ments in the periodontal practice. Number of missing teeth was an- other clinical characteristic of the perio-dontal patients associated with bothoral health-related quality of life andworse perceived oral health. This rela- tionship was more complex. When people were missing less than one-quarter of their dentition, quality oflife was unaected. Similarly, whenpeople were missing more than one-third of their dentition, quality of lifewas not substantially aected. It isonly within a relatively narrow rangeof missing teeth (one-quarter to one-third missing) that oral health-relatedquality of life seems to be aected, as compared to the people with a com- plete dentition or missing up to 3 teeth.This pattern was also observed for self-consciousness and denture discomfort,two specic questions of the oralhealth-related The ndings highlight the non- linearity between number of teeth andthese subjective assessments of oralhealth. Missing teeth has been relatedto oral health-related quality of life inseveral studies (27-33) and contrastingresults have been reported. Our nd- ings suggest that tooth loss may be associated with both a positive or anegative impact on quality of life,depending on whether a patient relatesthe loss of their teeth to absence ofdental pain and swelling or to func-tional limitations, such as eating andaesthetic appearance. The strengths of this study include the diversity of patients, who origin-ated from a large number of clinicalpractices across the north-west of the USA. The weaknesses of this study include the low response rate and thelack of additional information on otherspecic dental problems. As peoplewho do not respond to mail surveysmay be dierent from those who do,the low response rate may have intro-duced bias, the direction and magni-tude of which cannot be determined.No information was collected on arange of specic dental problems such as cavities, food impaction, receding gums and other specic dental prob-lems. Such data might have assisted indetermining to what extent periodontaltherapies could improve oral health-related quality of life outcomes. In summary, patients presenting for an initial periodontal examinationhave frequent problems related toteeth, gums and denture, and many ofthese patients perceive their oral health as fair or poor. In addition, lack of a linear association between periodontalpockets and these subjective measuresemphasizes the importance of usingsubjective oral health assessments inthe clinical practice as a tangiblepatient outcome, as they add informa-tion (which is not available throughthe purely clinical indices) about theimpact of the disease state on thepatient. Finally, the association of specic aspects of oral health-related quality of life and chronic periodontitisshould be conrmed or refuted in otherstudies as it may signicantly changethe perception of chronic periodontitisas a silent disease.

Many collected phenotypes have substantial genetic contributors; yet most genetic determinants remain to be identified. Using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a 100K genome-wide scan, we examine the as sociations of common polymorphisms with phenotypic variation in this community-based cohort and provid e a full-disclosure, web-based resource of results for fu ture replication studies. Methods: Adult participants (n = 1345) of the larges t 310 pedigrees in the FHS, many biologically related, were genotyped with the 100K Affyme trix GeneChip. These ge notypes were used to assess their contribution to 987 phe notypes collected in FHS over 56 years of follow up, including: cardiovascular risk facto rs and biomarkers; subclinical and clin ical cardiovascular disease; cancer and longevity traits; and traits in pulmonary, sl eep, neurology, renal, and bone domains. We conducted genome-wide variance components linkage and popu lation-based and family-based association tests. Results: The participants were white of European descent and from the FHS Original and Offspring Cohorts (examination 1 Offspring mean age 32 \u00b1 9 year s, 54% women). This overview summarizes the methods, selected findings and limitations of the results presented in the accompanying series of 17 manuscripts. The pr esented association results are based on 70,897 autosomal SNPs meeting the following rate 80%, p-value 0.001, and satisfying Mend elian consistency. analyses are based on 11,200 SNPs and short-ta ndem repeats. Results of phenotype-genotype linkages and associations for all autosomal SNPs are posted created a full-discl osure resource of results, posted on the dbGaP website, from a genome-wide association study in the FHS. Because we used three analytical approaches to examine the association and linkage of 987 pheno types with thousands of SNPs, our results must be considered hypothesis-generat ing and need to be replicated. Results from the FHS 100K project with NCBI web posting provides a resource for inve stigators to identify high priority findings for replication. Background Cardiovascular diseases are major illnesses among Ameri- cans, affecting about a third of the population (79 millionwith prevalent disease) and resulting in more than870,000 cardiovascular disease deaths annually [1]. Car- diovascular disease and its risk factors have substantial genetic contributors [2-11]. Numerous reports from theFramingham Heart Study (FHS) have documented thatcoronary heart disease [12,13], heritability and linkage/association to specific genomic regions. To evaluate the genetic contributors to these phenotypes, the Framingham Heart Study con-ducted a genome-wide scan of 1345 study participants intwo generations, using genotyping from the 100K Affyme-trix GeneChip Human Mapping Set. In this manuscript, we summarize the strategies that we pursued to conduct the 100K genome-wide study, provid- ing an overview for a series of 17 companion manuscripts(Table 1 of the Overview) describing associations withspecific collections of traits [26-42]. The primary purpose of this project was to generate hypotheses regardinggenetic factors that may contribute to the wide spectrumof phenotypic variables collected in the FHS through agenome-wide approach. More specifically, we primarily hypothesized that common genetic variants contributing to phenotypic variation can be detected through agenome-wide association study (GWAS) and that geneticloci contributing to phenotypic variation can be detectedthrough linkage. Each manuscript also examines whetherthe 100K analyses replicated previously reported associa- tions with consistent evidence from the literature for some specific traits. The main purpose of this series of publica-tions is to describe the association results made availablefor investigators and to direct readers to their free availa-bility in the database of Genotype and Phenotype(dbGaP) public repository http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007 at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), where these comprehensive results are posted and may bebrowsed in the context of multiple genomic tracks includ-BMC Medical Genetics 2007, 8(Suppl 1):S1 http://www.biomedcen tral.com/1471-2350/8/S1/S1 Page 3 of 19 for citation purposes)ing Entrez Gene, RefSeq, dbSNP, genetic markers, and OMIM. The deposition of these data in a public repository is consistent with the long tradition of publishing prelim-inary results from the FHS to benefit the wider scientificcommunity. To organize the evaluation of the rich resource of data col- lected over nearly 60 years of follow up, we established a set of \"Phenotype Working Groups\" that included clini-cians, epidemiologists, geneticists, and biostatisticians.These groups specified the traits to be studied, along withcovariate adjustment and subgroups for analyses. In all,987 phenotypes were examined for association, 835 for linkage. Some phenotypes are the same trait with different covariate adjustments, at different examinations or evalu-ated in different subgroups. For example, many traits wereevaluated with both age and sex adjustment as well aswith additional multivariable adjustments, yielding morethan one phenotype for analysis. Each manuscript in thisseries provides a platform for the web posted results. Not every trait is described in the manuscripts; rather, the pur- pose of each manuscript is to introduce the trait areas andto present a brief summary of the results. In the presentmanuscript, we describe the general approach to analysisof the traits, provide an overview of some results, and dis-cuss the limitations of the studies. Methods Study sample The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) began in 1948 withrecruitment of 5209 men and women (2336 men and2873 women) between the ages of 28 and 62 years in the town of Framingham, Massachusetts, about 20 miles west of Boston [43-46]. These individuals were recruitedthrough a two-thirds systematic sample of the householdsof Framingham, Massachusetts. Although not initiallyintended as a family study, many households consisted ofspouse pairs (1644 pairs). The primary purpose of the Study was to follow individuals over time for develop- ment of cardiovascular disease events to evaluate theinterplay among multiple risk factors that lead to diseaseand their individual and joint effects. The participants inthe Original Cohort have been examined every two yearssince. In 1971, an Offspring Cohort of 5124 men and women, who were adult children of Original Cohort members orwere spouses of these offspring, was recruited and hasbeen examined every four to eight years since [47,48]. Thesubjects in this report are drawn from the largest 310 ped-igrees in these two generations. The participants were recruited without regard to phenotypes. Thus, the Off- spring Cohort of 5124 (2483 men and 2641 women) wasrecruited by inviting all offspring of the spouse pairs(2616 and 34 stepchildren), the offspring spouses (1576)and, additionally, those offspring (898) of singleton Orig- inal Cohort members with elevated lipid levels. Further information regarding recruitment can be seen in Cuppleset al. [49] and Dawber [43]. In the late 1980s and through the 1990s, DNA was col- lected from living study participants. As many of the Orig- inal Cohort members were deceased by that time, these DNAs were mostly collected in Offspring Study partici-pants. During the mid- to late-1990s, 1702 DNA sampleswere the Service inthe largest 330 two-generation pedigrees consisting of2885 Framingham Study participants. These pedigrees were used for linkage analyses of blood pressure [15], lip- ids [17,50], body mass index [25] and a wide variety ofother traits [51-56]. The numbers of relative pairs amongthe 1345 subjects both genotyped and phenotyped in thisstudy are 435 parent-offspring pairs, 988 sib pairs, 300avuncular pairs and 634 first-cousin pairs. Among the1087 Offspring Cohort participants, who were the only participants evaluated in some analyses, there were 936 sib pairs, 63 avuncular pairs and 612 first-cousin pairs. Original Cohort study subjects return to the Study every two years for a detailed medical history, physical examina-tion and laboratory tests. The Original Cohort subjects are currently in their 29 th examination. Participants in the Offspring Cohort return every 4 to 8 years for similarexaminations and the 8 th examination is currently under- way. In the early 2000s, a family DNA plate set with 1,399 par- ticipants from these 330 pedigrees http:// www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/framingham/policies/ index.htm was established. Only subjects with lymphob- last cell lines were included on the plate set, although asubstantial number of the DNA samples on the plate setwere derived from whole blood or buffy coat. The family plate set was used for genotyping of the Affymetrix 100K GeneChip. After cleaning the genotyping the 1345 FHS participants, 278 from theOriginal and 1087 Offspring Cohorts. Phenotype definition & methods Given the breadth of phenotypes, we established 8 larger Phenotype Working Groups, overseeing 17 discrete phe- notypic domains, as 1. and lipids; 3. Pulmonary function andsleep; 4. biomarkers, including inflammatory and thrombotic factors; 5. Subclinical atherosclerosis; 6. Renal and endocrine function; 7. Longevity and aging,including brain and bone aging phenotypes; 8. Cardiovas-cular disease outcomes, electrocardiography andBMC Medical Genetics 2007, 8(Suppl 1):S1 http://www.biomedcen tral.com/1471-2350/8/S1/S1 Page 4 of 19 (page number not for citation purposes)heart rate variability. In addition, we established a statisti- cal and analytical methodology group. These groups were convened by the FHS Genetic Steering Committee to define phenotypes to be evaluated, including the covari-ates used in analyses, to review results of linkage and asso-ciation analyses, to foster communication among variousFramingham investigators who were working on differenttraits, and to suggest possible follow-up strategies. For the 100K genome-wide project, each Working Group defined the phenotypes to be studied. Since most traitshave well established factors that contribute to their vari-ation, each group created a set of residuals from multivar-iable regression models accounting for the primary known covariates, in order to control for confounding from these variables and to increase the ability to detectgenetic signals. For quantitative traits, the adjusted stand-ardized residuals were generated using linear regressionmodels. For qualitative traits, we used a variety ofapproaches including Cox proportional hazards withMartingale residuals for time-to-event (survival) traits and logistic regression with deviance residuals for dichoto- mous traits. These methods are described below. In somecases, several different covariate adjustments were usedfor a single trait. Each manuscript describes the specificadjustments that were applied. We used residuals fromregression models that included all subjects with traits in each Cohort, rather than limiting analyses to those who were genotyped, to produce residuals based on all subjectswith phenotypic values, regardless of availability of geno-typic data. This approach avoids potential biases in covari-ate adjustment based only upon the subset of individuals with both genotype and phenotype data and produces robust estimates of covariate effects. Genotyping methods Genomic DNA derived from whole blood or buffy coat was phenol-chloroform extracted and DNA from immor-talized lymphoblast cell lines was salt-precipitate extracted. Genotyping of the 100K SNPs in FHS families was performed through an ancillary study to Drs. MichaelChristman and Alan Herbert at Boston University Schoolof Medicine in the Department of Genetics and Genomicsusing the GeneChip Human Mapping 100K set fromAffymetrix, following the manufacturer's protocol as pre- viously described [57]. Genotypes were determined using the Dynamic Modeling (DM) algorithm [58]. For linkageanalyses, we also included microsatellites that had beengenotyped by the NHLBI Mammalian Genotyping Marshfield mark- ers)[59], covering the genome at an average density of one marker every 10 cM and with an average heterozygosity of0.77, were genotyped in 1702 subjects in the mid to late1990s (Screening Set v. 8))[60]. An additional 190 partic-ipants on the Family Plate Set were genotyped later withmicrosatellites using Screening Set v.13 and some addi- tional microsatellites were also genotyped in the FHS Genetics Laboratory. With the addition of these microsat-ellites and changes in the marker sets from Set 8, therewere 613 microsatellite markers available for analysis.Table 1: Papers published in the Framingham Heart Study 100K Series First Author Title Ramachandran S.

First, familial relationships were checked using thesib_kin utility in the Aspex software package [61]. Becausethis study focused on participants of families, nine indi-viduals were excluded as they no longer had biologic rel- atives in the sample. Twenty-six individuals were excluded due to inconsistencies; the majority of these individualswere found to have an excessive number of Mendelianerrors as identified by the software PedCheck, Version 1.1[62]. Others were excluded for having a relationshipinconsistency, for a sex discrepancy or for a low genotyp- ing call rate. Mendelian inconsistencies were resolved by removing the genotypes of all individuals within nuclearfamilies in which the error occurred. These steps left 1345individuals with genotypes available for analyses. For Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) testing, we ran- domly selected one individual per family to form a sam- ple of unrelated individuals. Then, for each of the 100K SNPs, the observed genotype frequencies were comparedto those expected under HWE using an exact chi-squaretest statistic [63] implemented in the Genetics package[64] in R, Version 1.2.0 [65]. To guard against a result thatmight depend upon an unusual selection of individuals, we repeated this process of a random selection of subjects ten times and computed the geometric mean of the ten p-values for the ten random samples of individuals as thefinal p-value for HWE tests for each SNP. Tests for HWEthat indicate a SNP is far from HWE suggest that the SNPmay have issues with genotyping error. We found HWE p-value < 0.001. We used a gen-otyping call rate cutpoint of 80% in part because of the use of the less accurate DM algorithm. SNPs with low MAF, low genotyping call rates and inadequate HWE pro-duced unstable results, so they were excluded from ourassociation results reported in this set of manuscripts,leaving 70,987 SNPs. Results for all autosomal dbGaP website, regardless of MAF, geno-typing call rates or HWE p-values; however, filters for these factors are provided on the dbGaP website. Linkage analyses Both microsatellites previously genotyped by Service and SNPs from the 100K wereused to calculate identity by descent probabilities. We constructed genetic maps using all microsatellite NCBI genetic markers with Marshfield genetic location availableand whose physical order and genetic order were consist-ent. Using this NCBI Marshfield map as our skeleton, weapplied linear interpolation from physical to genetic dis- tance to obtain approximate genetic locations (in centi- Morgans) for all SNPs in the 100K set with knownphysical location. Because current linkage analysis software cannot handle the marker density available from a 100K scan, we selected a subset of 10,592 SNPs to supplement 613 genome scan microsatellite markers available on 1886members of the largest 330 Framingham families. Weselected SNPs to minimize linkage disequilibrium (LD)because current linkage software assumes that markers arein linkage equilibrium, and violation of this assumption has been shown to create spurious linkage evidence in cer- tain contexts [66,67]. Thus, for calculation identity bydescent (IBD) probabilities for linkage analyses we usedSNPs with a call rate of at least 85%, HWE p-value > 0.05and more informative markers with MAF > 5%. We itera-tively identified SNP pairs with LD measure D' > 0.5, asestimated from HapMap data, and eliminated the SNP that was least informative for linkage (lowest MAF). We started with SNP pairs most closely located (physical dis-tance) and continued until no pairs of SNPs had a D'measure exceeding 0.5. The final set of 10,592 SNPs com-bined with the 613 microsatellites were checked for excessrecombination using MERLIN, Version 0.10.2 [68], and 4 SNPs and 1 microsatellite were omitted from linkage anal- yses based on a high number of possible errors, leaving atotal of 11,200 markers to perform linkage analysis(10,588 SNPs + 612 short tandem repeats). Variance component linkage analyses were performed on residuals of up to 1341 individuals in 310 full pedigrees. Four of the 1345 subjects were the only person in a pedi-gree and were excluded from linkage analyses since theycontributed no information. Multipoint probabilities ofIBD between relative pairs were computed at each geneticmarker location with the program MERLIN, Version 0.10.2. Due to size limitations for exact identity by descent (IBD) multipoint computation in MERLIN soft-ware [68], the 310 full pedigrees were broken into 356smaller pedigrees. The hypothesis of \"no linkage at a spe-cific genomic location\" was tested by modelsincorporating an effect of a putative quantitative traitlocus (QTL) in complete linkage to the genetic marker, in the form of multipoint IBD sharing probabilities at the locus, to models incorporating only polygenic effectswithout a QTL effect. At each genetic location, a LODscore was computed as the logarithm to base 10 of thelikelihood ratio of the locus-specific model to the poly-genic model using the program SOLAR, Version 3.0.4 [69]. Allele frequencies were estimated by simple allele counts. In Framingham family data, which were collectedfrom randomly sampled pedigrees, we have found theallele frequency estimates by simple allele countingBMC Medical Genetics 2007, 8(Suppl 1):S1 http://www.biomedcen tral.com/1471-2350/8/S1/S1 Page 6 of 19 (page number not for citation purposes)closely match those calculated by maximum likelihood methods accounting for familial correlations. Association testing We applied population-based and family-based methods to test for association between the 100K SNPs and resid-ual phenotypes using an additive model unless otherwise specified. We used family-based association test methods, implemented in the program FBAT, Version 1.5.5 [70,71],to test for differences in probability of transmission of agenotype from parents to offspring based on phenotype,as a test of linkage and association. FBAT has limitedpower because it requires association within families, and many families are non-informative. However, because FBAT examines association only within families, the type-I error rate is not affected by population stratificationbias)[72,73]. We did not report results if the number ofinformative families was fewer than 10. For the population-based approach, we used generalized estimating equation (GEE) [74] regression models to test for association between the 100K SNPs and each residualphenotype while taking into account the correlationamong related individuals. We implemented the GEEapproach by breaking families into sibships and used anexchangeable working correlation matrix to account for correlation within each sibship. Parental correlations with their children were not considered in these analyses. Theanalyses were performed using the gee program package,Version 4.13-10 [75] in R [65]. The GEE association test isa population-based approach that uses all individualswith both genotype and phenotype, regardless of geno- type configuration within a family. Therefore, it is expected to be a powerful test of association if populationstratification bias is not believed to be an issue, as in theFHS [76]. Results Participant characteristics Of the 1345 subjects who satisfied appropriate familialrelationships and who were considered in the presenta-tion of results in these manuscripts, 258 were OriginalCohort participants (90 men and 168 women) and 1087were Offspring Cohort participants (527 men and 560women). Table 2 of the Overview presents descriptive information on these participants at enrollment (exami- nation one). The Offspring and Cohort participantsincluded on the family plates had lower mean age thanother examination 1 participants, as these subjects neededto survive to the mid 1990s to provide DNA. We note thatwe used residuals based upon all subjects, as opposed to only those who were genotyped. Thus, the phenotypes reflect deviations of these subjects based on regressionsfor the full sample of subjects and are thus representativeof the full sample.Format of the FHS 100K manuscripts We present 17 manuscripts, each displaying selectedresults for an epidemiologically related group of traits.Table 1 of the Overview presents the title and first authorof each manuscript. The web resource displaying geneticassociation and linkage results is available at the NCBIdbGaP website, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/ gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007 . Each manuscript describes the traits that were studied and presents someresults. These manuscripts are not intended to be compre-hensive and generally do not include results for all pheno-types and covariate adjustment schemes that were studiedand presented on the website. Full listings of all traits eval- uated are provided in Additional file 1 (phenotypes for population-based GEE analyses), Additional file 2 (phe-notypes for family-based FBAT analyses) and Additionalfile 3 (phenotypes for linkage analyses), including urllinks to the corresponding analytical results on the NCBIdbGaP website. To facilitate the reading of these manu-scripts, we have used a common format for all manu- scripts. Table 1 of each manuscript presents a general description of the phenotypes that were evaluated. Table2 of each manuscript displays the top results (lowest p-values) from GEE analyses, the top results (lowest p-val-ues) from FBAT analyses and linkage results where theLOD score was 2 or more. Whereas top association results are based solely on p-value rank, the Working Groups also applied various additional strategies to identify SNPs thatthe group would prioritize to pursue further. For Table 3of each manuscript, the groups devised schema to sum-marize results for related traits, grouping phenotypic traitswithin biologically plausible domains, or traits examined longitudinally. Each manuscript provides a description of the strategy employed and the results for its Table 3.Finally, Table 4 in each manuscript lists some SNPs thatare the same as or correlated with genetic variants in genesthat have been reported in the literature to be associatedwith the manuscript's phenotypes and indicates whether our results replicate those reports. Physical locations of the SNPs are provided according to NCBI Build35,whereas the dbGaP website uses a more recent version.Thus, the physical locations reported in the manuscriptsmay differ from those on the website. Each manuscriptprovides criteria for choosing which results were reported. SNP allele frequencies and distribution Allele frequencies for the 100K Affymetrix GeneChip inthe Framingham sample are displayed in Figure 1. About38% have MAF < 10% and are not considered in the seriesof manuscripts, although they are included on the dbGaPwebsite. Among SNPs with MAF 10%, there were large numbers between 10-25% and were somewhat evenly spread over the range from 25-50% MAF. Many SNPs onthe Affymetrix Chip are not near genes (Figure 2). About30,000 with MAF 10% are within 5 kb of anotherBMC Medical Genetics 2007, 8(Suppl 1):S1 http://www.biomedcen tral.com/1471-2350/8/S1/S1 Page 7 of 19 (page number not for citation purposes)10,000 with MAF < 10% are within 5 kb. The remaining SNPs are further away from known genes. P-value distribution The results displayed on the NCBI dbGaP study.cgi?id=phs000007 include call rate, HWE p-value or MAF;adjustable filters for these factors are provided. In ourmanuscripts, we present results for SNPs that satisfy geno-typing call rates 80%, HWE p-value 0.001, MAF 10%. The proportion of call rate of 80% is 97.4%; 91% of SNPs satisfied a call rate of 90%. We expect only a small percentage of all tested SNPs to be truly associated with any phenotype. Therefore, to obtain an approximation of the null distribution of p-values, we examined the distribution of p-values for 415 phenotypesfrom the Metabolic Working Group and 14 CVD eventphenotypes. If one assumes that only a few true associa-tions exist for each phenotype, these p-value distributionsapproximate the null distribution, because only a fewSNPs out of the large total number tested would be expected to exceed any critical value due to true associa- tions. Table 3 of the Overview displays the proportion ofp-values among all SNPs below specific nominal alphalevels, summarized (mean, minimum and maximum)across all phenotypes in the trait group for GEE and FBATresults. Many of the phenotypes in the Metabolic Working Group were approximately normally distributed (about 90% hadabsolute value of skewness <1 and about 80% had abso-lute value of kurtosis <2) and thus may reflect the situa- tion for which the assumptions of the analytical methodswere generally satisfied. We display two sets of results inTable 3 of the Overview for these phenotypes, those usedin the publication of the manuscripts with the number of SNPs equal to 70,987 and the larger set of results dis- played on the website with the number of SNPs equal to~100-103 K. The difference in the number of SNPs evalu-ated for GEE and FBAT results arises from those SNPs thatare uninformative for FBAT analyses (those with suffi-ciently rare minor allele so that fewer than 10 nuclear fam- ilies were informative for transmission). The p-value distributions suggest that FBAT p-values generally followthe expected null distribution, assuming that nearly allresults are false positives, and may actually be somewhatconservative. In contrast, the GEE p-values exhibit anexcess of small p-values, especially for smaller nominal alpha levels. For example, for SNPs reported in the manu- scripts, the average proportion of SNPs for a phenotypewith p-value below specified alpha levels ranged from 1.3to 19 times greater than the nominal level (1.3 timeslarger for nominal alpha of 0.01, 19 for nominal alpha of10 -7 and 10 for 10-8). The excess is higher for the full set of SNPs reported on the website. Here we found that the average proportion ranged from 1.2 times larger for nom- inal level of 0.05 to 19 times greater for nominal level of10 -5 and 2500 times greater for nominal level 10-8. The CVD phenotypes represent an extreme case, as the phenotypes were residuals from survival models, were generally bimodal, and do not satisfy general assumptions for normality. We see the same general pattern that weobserved for the Metabolic Working Group phenotypeswith somewhat conservative FBAT tests and excess num-Table 2: Description of Fram ingham Heart Study Subjects in 100K Genome-Wide Scan.

As might be expected, the CVD phenotypes revealed larger excesses of small GEE p-values, with the average proportion of SNPs fallingbelow specified alpha levels ranging from 1.08 (5.4% fornominal 5% with SNPs reported in the manuscripts) to2.4 times greater for nominal level of 10 -5 and 67 times greater for nominal 10-8 than expected. Thus, GEE p-val- ues need to be interpreted with care, as SNPs in the lowest p-value range have the potential to be especially enriched with false positives. We also examined the dependence of the p-value distribu- tion for GEE results on the genotyping call rate for theMetabolic Working Group phenotypes. Our sample was not ascertained on trait status; so genotyping failures were likely to be randomly distributed. Therefore, one mightexpect that the effect of genotyping error on type I errorwould be more modest than for case-control studies)[77].As expected, we continued to find an excess of small p-val- ues, despite increasingly stringent call rate thresholds. More importantly, we found that this excess occurredregardless of call rate. For example, for nominal alpha of0.001 and genotyping call rate > 95%, we found that theratio of the number of observed to expected significantresults ranged from 1.6 for MAF in the range of (0.2, 0.5)to 7.0 for MAF in the range (0, 0.05). Similarly, for call rate less than 80% we found similar ratios of 1.6 to 8.1, respectively. For nominal alpha of 10 -6 we found this ratio varied from 9.5 to 614 for call rate > 95% and 6.8 to 667for call rate < 80%. Thus, we used a liberal genotyping callrate of > 80% for presentation of results in our manu-scripts to err on the side of including a result rather than not, even though we expect nearly all results to be false positives.Table 3: Proportion of p- values falling below nominal levels for selected traits SNPs with MAF 10%, HWE p 0.001 and Genotyping Call Rate 80% Nominal alpha level # 0.05 There were 415 Metabolic Traits and 14 CVD Events from which th ese descriptive statistics were calculated using the # SNPs in dicated. # SNPs = average number of SNPs across all traits in the Trait Group; Mean = average proportion of SNPs below nominal level across phen otypes in the trait group; Min = minimum proportion below nomi nal level across phenotypes in the trait group; Max = maximum propor tion below nominal level across phenotypes in the trait group.BMC Medical Genetics 2007, 8(Suppl 1):S1 http://www.biomedcen tral.com/1471-2350/8/S1/S1 Page 9 of 19 (page number not for citation purposes)Figure 3 displays observed GEE (blue) and FBAT (red) p- values versus expected p-values (straight line) on a nega-tive logarithm scale for mean fasting plasma glucose andmean high density lipoprotein cholesterol, calculatedfrom Offspring measurements over exams 1 to 7. We see that FBAT p-values tend to be less significant than expected (conservative) whereas GEE p-values tend to bemore significant than expected (liberal), especially forsmaller expected p-values. While we would expect most p-values to fall on the line if there were no genetic associa-tions, p-values that reflect true associations will be more extreme (smaller) than expected. In looking at the figure for mean fasting glucose, SNPs represented by the bluedots (GEE) far above the expected line on the right handside of the figure may represent true associations withmean fasting plasma glucose. The plot for mean fastingHDL cholesterol also suggests that there may be some truepositives, as even a few FBAT p-values are more extreme than expected. As in any GWAS, we expect that most results with small p- values are false positives. The p-value distributions sup-port this notion and further suggest that the GEE resultsmay have more false positives than one would expect. Table 2 in each manuscript ranks results by p-value, but each paper also pursues its own strategy to identify whichresults may be more worthy of follow up in Table 3 ofeach manuscript, usually by considering evidence from several sources such as correlated traits. Power estimations for popu lation-based association approach To assess the power of the population-based association approach with GEE, we simulated a trait following a nor-mal distribution with 30% polygenic heritability in thissample of 1345 subjects. We generated a SNP with MAF0.10 and assumed that the SNP was the QTL with an addi-tive effect and QTL heritability varying from 1% to 5%. We also varied the proportion of phenotyped individuals from 60% to 100%, as some traits were not available in allsubjects genotyped. The phenotype and genotype datawere simulated using Version 3.0.4. Wetested the association between the SNP and the trait usingGEE. One thousand replicates were performed for eachscenario. The results are displayed in Table 4 of the Over- view. For a conservative alpha level such as 10 -8, we have more than 80% power to detect a SNP explaining 4% ormore total phenotypic variation when 60% indi-viduals are phenotyped. With higher MAF, the powerremains similar for the same QTL heritability (data notshown). Thus, we have sufficient power to detect SNPs explaining 4% or more of the phenotypic variance using the population-based GEE association test approach, con-trolling for multiple testing for a single trait. The effect sizefor a specific QTL heritability, defined as the increase/Table 4: Power of the po pulation-based association approach (GEE test) for a SNP with MAF = 0.1 Nominal Type I Error SNP QTL Heritability 0.99 0.97 GEE 1 1 1 0.996 0.9915 % 0 . 5 3 G E E 11111111 ~80% subjects have phenotype(~20% missing at random): 1 1 1 1 1 1 0.99 ~60% subjects have phenotype(~40% mi ssing at random): 0.931 *SD: Standard Deviation.

For example, for a SNP explaining 4% of the phenotypic vari-ation, the effect size is 0.47 times the phenotypic standarddeviation (SD) for a MAF of 0.1, and 0.28 SD for a MAF of0.5. Synthetic strategies Beyond simple examination of individual p-values for sin-gle tests, the authors of each manuscript developed theirown synthetic strategies to prioritize SNPs that may beworthy of follow up (results shown in Table 3 of eachmanuscript). Many strategies considered results amongsimilar traits. For example, the Subclinical Working Group created four subgroups of traits: (1) ankle brachial index Within each trait group, SNPs were ranked according to the proportion of traits with p < 0.01 for both FBAT and GEE in the group. Table 3 in the Sub-clinical manuscript displays the top 5 ranked SNPs withhighest proportions of significant traits and lowest meanGEE p-values for each trait group [29]. The Lipids Sub-group of the Metabolic Working Group decided phenotypes measured in Offspring subjects: apol- ipoprotein measured at exam 4, small lipoprotein as measured by nuclear magneticresonance, mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol lev-els over 7 exams, and mean log triglyceride levels over 7exams [39]. Presenting only those results where at least 3of the 4 traits had GEE p-value < 0.01, the SNPs were ranked according to geometric mean of these four traits [39].

Some results of interest The main results for each Working Group are presented inthe individual manuscripts of this series. Here we high- light some results that address some of our expectations. Overlap of linkage and association results Whereas strategies for genetic studies have been undergo- ing substantial changes in recent years, partly due tochanges in the laboratory, we hypothesized that genomic regions that harbor significant linkage results would also contain significant association results. One example of theconcordance of linkage and association results was notedfor monocyte chemoattractant marker, where a region of linkage (LOD =4.96 at chromosome 1, 159 Mb) for MCP1 concentrationsalso contains two SNPs on chromosome 1 within the 1.5 support interval for the linkage peak and within 60 kb of the genes OR10J1 and FCER1A or OR10J3 (rs4128725 and rs2494250 with p-values in the 10 -8 range by FBAT, 10-12 by GEE) [33]. We found a similar result for C-reac- tive protein with a LOD score of 3.28 on chromosome 1and two significant SNPs (rs2794520 (p = 2.83*10 -8) and rs2808629 (p = 3.19*10-8)) within the 1.5 support inter- val of this peak [33]. Whereas Lp(a) had the highest LODscore (LOD = 23.0) at 159.4 Mb, a SNP (rs1591375)located at 160.7 Mb near this peak had somewhat modestp-values by comparison (4.37*10 -06 by GEE and 0.0045 by FBAT) [39]. However, there were many instances for which there was no evidence of linkage in the setting ofsignificant association. Additionally, each manuscriptdescribes linkage results that are in accord with previouslypublished linkage results. SNPs overlapping across phenotypes We did not expect the same SNPs to appear in many man-uscripts, as cardiovascular disease is complex and involvesa large and varied number of pathways for its develop-ment. In contrast, some manuscripts report on correlatedtraits. Thus, we examined overlap among the top 500 SNPs associated with the phenotypes across 3 Metabolic Working phenotypes. Of 11 SNPs found inmore than one group, none were found among the top500 SNPs in all three groups. However, 7 SNPs werefound in the glycemia and obesity groups, 2 in glycemiaand lipid groups and 2 in lipid and obesity groups [38- 40]. Replication of prior associations In Table 4 of each manuscript, we investigated whether our results replicated previous reports in the literature.The 100K chip does not contain many SNPs in well- known lipid genes, such as APOE . On the other hand, we found that SNP rs7007797 in the LPL gene was associated with both HDL and triglycerides [39]; we replicated recentfindings of association of a SNP in the TCF7L2 gene withdiabetes [38]. Strong statistical support was found for theassociation of factor VII concentrations with SNP rs561241 on chromosome 13 (4*10 -16) [34], which resides near the factor VII gene and is in complete linkagedisequilibrium (r 2 = 1) with the Arg/Gln FVII SNP previ- ously shown to account for 9% of the total phenotypicvariance [78]. Similarly, we found associations of circulat-ing levels of C-reactive protein with a SNP in the gene encoding C-reactive protein [33]. Two SNPs in SORL 1 , a gene recently related to the risk of Alzheimer's disease[79], were found to be associated with performance ontests of abstract reasoning (rs1131497; FBAT p = 3.2 SNPs (rs2543600 and rs27225364) near the WRN gene that causes premature aging are associated with age at death and morbidity-free survival at age 65 years [35]. The LD between these SNPs and those previously reported inthe WRN gene is unknown as the previously reportedSNPs are not in the HapMap. We found that SNPrs2478518 in the AGT gene was associated with both systolic and diastolic blood pressure [28]. The association of common variation at the NOS1AP locus with electro- cardiographic QT interval duration was replicated ranging from 0.0001-0.0009 for 4 partially corre-lated SNPs [27]. 100K GeneChip SNPs of Affymetrix 100K GeneChip SNPs by distance from known genes .

For example, we did not find significant SNPs in ACE associ- ated with blood pressure [28]. PPARG P12A (rs1801282) was not associated with diabetes or related traits includingbody mass index [38]. Some of these 'negative' results maybe due to low power or low LD between a SNP reported inthe literature and SNPs on the 100K chip. We have also identified a few results that are biologically compelling, although replication of the SNP association iswarranted. For example, we found that a SNP(rs1158167) near the CST3 gene was highly associated with serum levels = 8.5*10 -09) 2.5% of the variation in serum cystatin-C levels in our data and has been previously reported to be associated with cystatin-C. These results arepresented in more detail in the Renal Endocrine WorkingGroup manuscript [42]. Replication of results from other genome-wide studies While we have been preparing this series of manuscripts,several genome-wide studies have been published [80-86]. Some results in our analyses support results reportedin these recent studies. For example, we find significantassociations for coronary heart disease, cardiovascular dis- ease and coronary artery calcium [29,30] in the same chromosomal region on 9p recently reported to be associ-ated with myocardial infarction by Helgadottir et al. [82] and McPherson et al. [83]. While our results need to be compared more closely with results being reported byother genome-wide studies, this example provides evi- dence that our results replicate strong associations from other genome-wide studies. Discussion We have presented a brief description of the methods anda few selected results derived from analyses of the 100KAffymetrix GeneChip with a large number of FHS traits, ranging from CVD events and subclinical measures to tra- ditional cardiovascular risk factors of diabetes, lipid lev-els, blood pressure and also including more novelbiomarker measures that reflect modern hypotheses, suchas the role of inflammatory pathways in the developmentof CVD. We have also reported on a number of neurolog- ical, renal, cancer and aging traits, including longevity (age at death) and bone mass and structure. None of thesemanuscripts provide a comprehensive report. Rather, thepurpose of this set of manuscripts is to provide a briefObserved versus Expected p-values (-log base 10 scale) for Mean Fasting Glucose in O ffspring Exams 1 to 7 (Left) and for Mean Fasting High Density Lipoprotein in Offspring Exams 1 to 7 (Right)Figure 3 Observed versus Expected p-values (-log base 10 scal e) for Mean Fasting Glucose in Offspring Exams 1 to 7 (Left) and for Mean Fasting Hi gh Density Lipoprotein in Offspring Exams 1 to 7 (Right) .

BMC Medical Genetics 2007, 8(Suppl 1):S1 http://www.biomedcen tral.com/1471-2350/8/S1/S1 Page 13 of 19 (page number not for citation purposes)summary of the results and to introduce readers to the data posted on the dbGaP website http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/ study.cgi?id=phs000007 . We note that the genotypes in this sample have also been evaluated by Drs. MichaelChristman and Alan Herbert. Some of their results arereported on line as described by Herbert et al. [87]. Several aspects of our investigation merit comment. First , the present investigation represents a comprehensiveGWAS analysis of numerous phenotypes in a large com-munity-based cohort. To our knowledge, it is the largestGWAS performed in an observational cohort in terms of the number of phenotypes analyzed and web posted. Sec- ond, we exploited the phenotypic diversity and richness of the Framingham Offspring Study database to analyze aset of phenotypes that were for the most part collected bydetailed, direct measurements of study participants. Fur-ther, many of the phenotypes are quantitative traits. Phe-notypes have been broadly categorized into seventeen different domains for manuscripts in this supplement. It is noteworthy that key risk factor phenotypes, such asblood pressure and lipid levels, were collected at multipleexaminations, and thus we were able to conduct analysesusing time-averaged traits, maximizing the scientific yieldfrom the longitudinal prospective design of our cohort study. Further, several recently collected phenotypes, in particular biomarkers and imaging measures, were col-lected using reproducible, state-of-the-art modali-ties. Correlated phenotypes facilitated the ofpleiotropy by seeking associations of SNPs with such phe-notypes. These investigations occurred primarily among the variables in each individual manuscript. Finally, for most phenotypes, there was evidence for a significant her-itable component from FHS or other studies. We acknowl-edge that some phenotypic domains may representanalytical constructs, rather than truly distinct groupsfrom a biological standpoint. Third , we have web-posted the results of all analyses on autosomes on dbGaP, including results without statisticalevidence of association, so that investigators world-widecan access the data freely and mine them in silico for hypothesis generation, inclusion in meta-analysis, anddirect comparisons with their own results. In addition to the freely posted aggregate results, participant-specific genotypic and phenotypic data are available for distribu-tion for further analyses to approved scientific investiga-tors world-wide via the NCBI/NHLBI and consistent withFramingham Study data distribution policies (see http:// www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/framingham/policies/ index.htm ). For the purpose of publication, reference to these analyses may be made by referring to either theappropriate manuscript or the specific URL for web-posted data. Fourth , the simultaneous and full-disclosurerelease (on the web) of all association and linkage results of phenotypes encompassing at least 17 different domains in a cohesive and comprehensive manner signifies the tre-mendous teamwork of numerous FHS investigators, stat-isticians, programmers, and others. Most importantly, thiseffort would not be possible without the full cooperationand commitment of the FHS participants, who continue to attend Study examinations in an effort to further the scientific knowledge of factors that lead to heart diseaseand other traits. Fifth , as in any genome-wide association study with a large number of SNPs, most results that are considered statistically significant by a conventional p < 0.05 may be falsely positive; so it is difficult to decide what results areimportant. Not only do we have a large number of statis-tical tests for each phenotype, but we also have numerousphenotypes. Thus, considering multiple testing in theinterpretation of results is of paramount importance.There are several approaches to address the issue of multi- ple testing, such as Bonferroni correction, permutation testing and false discovery rates. To conduct permutationtesting for all of the traits that we considered is prohibi-tively time-consuming, particularly in preserving herita-bility of the traits with family data. Further, withcorrelated traits it is difficult to decide what traits should be included in a permutation testing strategy. One approach to controlling the false-positive rate in genome-wide association studies is to set a stringent threshold fordeclaring statistical significance. According to the reportof the International HapMap Consortium, complete test-ing of common variants (MAF > 0.05) in each 500 kb is equivalent to performing 150 independent tests in white populations of European descent [88]. Using this guideand given that there are about 3000 Mb in the humangenome, we would estimate that there are approximately900,000-1,000,000 independent tests if testing all com-mon variants in the genome. A conservative Bonferroni correction using this number of tests (0.05/1,000,000) yields an approximate threshold of genome-wide signifi-cance to be 5*10 -8. Thus, for a single trait, one could use this threshold. Several results do fall below this threshold(Table 5 of the Overview). In considering these results, wenote that our sample size of 1345 biologically related sub-jects is relatively small for detecting genetic variants of modest effect. We also note that we have a large number of correlated traits, including the same traits with differentcovariate adjustments. Further, we have already observedthat our GEE results have an excess number of small p-val-ues. Thus, we are hesitant to regard any result reported inour manuscripts as significant at a genome-wide level. We believe these findings are best regarded as hypothesis-gen- erating. The determination of what constitutes genome-wide significance is challenged both by theoretical consid-erations as well as practical ones. Without pursuing moreBMC Medical Genetics 2007, 8(Suppl 1):S1 http://www.biomedcen tral.com/1471-2350/8/S1/S1 Page 14 of 19 (page number not for citation purposes)computationally intensive analyses, it is thus difficult to provide specific advice regarding what SNPs are most important. It may be safer to assume that most of the small p-values are likely to be false positives and thatreplication of our results in other independent samplesis of critical importance . We proceed with presentation of full-disclosure results to encourage readers to pursue such studies. Sixth , we note that use of the 80% genotyping call rate is unusually liberal by today's standards in GWAS. We usedthis threshold in these manuscripts to be inclusive, ratherthan exclusive, in a first look such as this. We recognize that this threshold may permit consideration of some results that could be spurious due problems with genotyp-ing. However, a limitation of our genotypes is that thegenotype calls were made with the DM algorithm, whichis less precise than those that have recently been intro-duced. At this time, we are unable to apply more accurate,reliable genotyping calls [89], as we do not have access to the source data. Further, we found that the choice of the 80% threshold versus a more conservative one had littleeffect upon p-value distributions. Finally, all results,regardless of genotyping call rate, are posted on thedbGaP website and thus, investigators can evaluate forthemselves what they believe to be the more valid results from this study. Seventh , in our analyses we found that the GEE results appear to have an excess of significant results. We suspectthat one reason is low MAF. Also, given the small sampleof at most 1345 subjects, we would expect only 13-14 individuals to have the minor homozygote. Thus, we lim- ited the results that we present in the manuscripts to thoseSNPs with MAF = 10%. Further analyses have indicatedthat use of a linear mixed effects model such as incorpo-rating a SNP as a covariate in a regression model withproper correlation structure for the error terms that fully represent the familial correlations remedies this problem and has a valid type I error rate in simulated data.Eighth , coverage of LD is incomplete with the 100K scan. Nicolae et al. report that the Affymetrix 100K GeneChip includes fewer SNPs in coding and more SNPs in inter-genic regions than represented on the HapMap [90]. Fur-ther, our sample size is modest. These two facts combinedlikely limit the power for detection of associations withseveral traits in these data. For instance, while we noted modest to high heritability of numerous phenotypes, underscoring the contribution of additive genetic effectsto interindividual variation in these traits, we did not findsignificant low p-values for several heritable traits in rela-tion to the SNPs evaluated. Factors contributing to thisobservation included both the limited coverage of the Affymetrix 100K GeneChip as well as the possibility that some of the less significant p-values (example between0.05 and 10 -5) may represent true positive findings. The limited power to detect SNPs of small effect sizes offeredby the analysis of our relatively modest sample size of~1300 participants contributes to this phenomenon aswell; we only have high power to detect a SNP explaining 4% or more of the phenotypic variance in the population- based GEE association test; the power of FBAT and vari-ance component linkage analysis is even lower. Additionally, for several of the analyzed phenotypes we did not observe any overlap between the top SNP-pheno- type associations noted in GEE and FBAT analyses. The inherent differences in the two analytical methods espe-cially in the context of the modest sample sizes, particu-larly for FBAT with small numbers of informative trios,may contribute to this phenomenon. FBAT is limited bythe number of informative transmissions and although we suspect that there is little population stratification in our sample [76], GEE is limited by potential bias due tostratification. Furthermore, for several phenotypes theSNPs associated with the top LOD scores in linkage anal-yses were not among the top 50 SNPs in association anal-yses (GEE or FBAT). Table 5: Associations achieving nomi nal genome wide significance, p < 5*10-8 across the 17 phenotype working groups Phenotype working group/manuscriptTrait F7 The following phenotype working groups did traits achieving nominal genome-wide significance: echocardiography, fl ow-mediated of 19 (page number not for citation purposes)Ninth , we were limited in our ability to replicate genetic variants previously reported to be associated with pheno- types in our database because specific coverage of suchgenetic variation in these candidates was limited in theAffymetrix 100K GeneChip. We view such analyses asmore illustrative of the potential utility of our GWAS,rather than as definitive evidence for or against an associ- ation described with a putative candidate gene in the pub- lished literature. Our data do suggest several interesting biological candi- dates among the SNPs most strongly associated with dif-ferent traits in the various analytical approaches. The strongest and most clear-cut of the associations were for those phenotypes that represent the direct protein productof a gene. Examples include the association of CRP con-centrations with SNPs in the CRP gene (Benjamin et al. in this series [33]) and factor VII levels with SNP rs561241on chromosome 13 (Yang et al. in this series [34]). Thus, while it is difficult to point to any result as definitive, those results for which we find some evidence of replica- tion of associations found in the literature are regarded asworthy of further research. Finally , the Framingham Study participants were white of European descent and predominantly middle-aged to eld- erly. Hence, the genetic associations may not be generaliz- able to other ethnicities/races or to younger individuals. Conclusion In summary, the results from the FHS 100K associationand linkage studies described herein and posted on the NCBI website provide a GWAS resource for investigators. We have presented a description of the methods and gen-eral strategies used for analysis of the 100K AffymetrixGeneChip in relation to a broad range of traits measuredin the FHS. Brief descriptions of results of these analysesare provided a series of 17 manuscripts, with results for all autosomal SNPs genotyped successfully displayed at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/ study.cgi?id=phs000007 . Interested investigators can also access the data through a standing protocol, described athttp://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/framingham/policies/ index.htm . Key to interpretation of these results is replica- tion and evaluation of these results in other cohorts and ultimately, functional studies. We encourage investigators to examine the results and to pursue the genetic signalstherein in their own cohorts. In the near future we willprovide results and data from approximately 550,000SNPs on more than 9000 participants from three genera-tions in the FHS SNP Health Association Resource (SHARe) project. Data will be available to qualified inves- tigators through an application process to dbGaP. It is ourhope that the results from these two genome-wide associ-ation studies will lead to a much deeper understanding ofthe role of common genetic variation in the development of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors.

Objectives: To explore the relationship between patient's intention to change re\u00ad garding future alcohol consumption following brief alcohol intervention (BAI) and changes in al\u00ad cohol consumption 12-months later and the communication characteristics between patient and counselor during BAL Design, Setting and Subjects: Data from 367 patients (experimental arm) of a pragmatic random\u00ad ized controlled trial were used to assess the effectiveness of BAI among hazardous drinkers attend\u00ad ing an Emergency Department (Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland). Alcohol outcome measures at baseline and 12 months follow-up included usual number of drinks per week, monthly frequency of heavy episodic drinking (5 or more standard drinks for men; 4 or more for women), and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score. In addition, the com\u00ad munication characteristics between patient and counselor were analyzed via tape recordings using the Motivational Interviewing Skill Code (MISC) from 97 participants. Patient readiness and im\u00ad portance to change on a IO-point Likert scale (readiness/importance to change ruler) was asked during BAI, and patient intention to change alcohol consumption (yes/no) was asked at the last step. Differences in alcohol outcome at follow-up between the 367 patients who did or did not have an intention to change consumption at baseline were compared, as were differences between these two groups in communication characteristics for the 97 who completed tape recordings. Results: Patients with an intention to decrease alcohol consumption reduced alcohol use and related problems more often, and reported higher levels of importance and readiness to change than did their counterparts. Analyses of MISC-coded data showed a significantly higher use of Ml-consistent skills among those with a moderation intention, but no group differences on the 8 other counselor communication skills measures were found. Analyses of patient speech during the intervention indicated that those with an intention to change their alcohol consumption signifi\u00ad cantly more often self-explored personal ambivalence towards alcohol, expressed more intensely their ability, commitment, desire, need and reason to change their alcohol use than did those in the no decrease group. Conclusions: The intention expressed by hazardous drinkers when concluding BAI is associ\u00ad ated with both patient change talk during BAI and drinking outcome 12 months later, but is mainly Jean-Bernard Daeppen, Gerhard Gmel, and Jacques Gaume are affiliated with the Alcohol Treatment Center, Department of Community Medicine and Health, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.

Brief alcohol intervention, intention, patient adherence, communication charac\u00ad teristics, motivational interviewing skills code, counselor skills INTRODUCTION Several systematic reviews and meta-analy\u00ad ses support the belief that brief alcohol inter\u00ad vention (BAI) is effective in reducing hazard\u00ad ous alcohol use in a variety of patients.l> However, this aggregated effectmight help ob\u00ad scure the fact that not all patients gain from BAI. Following BAI, some patients (independ\u00ad ently of their drinking patterns) will demon\u00ad strate major changes in their alcohol use, stay the same, or even increase drinking. Little is known about the patientor counselor character\u00ad istics associated with behavior changes. Sev\u00ad eral authors have looked at moderators (charac\u00ad teristics) of BAI efficacy that influence the degree to which behavior change occurs, such as patient gender,' age,6,7 severity of alcohol use disorder.f counselor empathy and directive\u00ad ness-? and type ofBAI (e.g., duration, number of sessionsv'''). Patient readiness to change!' may also mod\u00ad erate behavior change resulting from BAI. Gains made by some patients might be due to contemplated changes among those who have high levels of readiness to change. Here, even briefexposure may triggerrelatively important and long-lasting behavior changes, where for other patient's interventions that are much more intensive may be of little help.l? One study':'concluded, afterexamining the relative value of readiness or underlying motivational dimensions of perceived desire, ability, or rea\u00ad sons to change alcohol or drug use, that com\u00ad mitment was the final common pathway in the process of change. Many patients might have high levels of readiness. but lack firm commit\u00ad ment to change, thus showing poorer drinking outcomes in many ofthe BAI studies. Since the final step of BAI often incorporates asking pa\u00adtients their intention, those who commit to moderation are probably more likely to actually reduce their alcohol use by follow-up. BAI generally incorporates motivational in\u00ad terviewing (MI) style and techniques for use in time-limi ted health care settings .14-17 In MI-style BAI, characteristics related to patient commitment, expressed by an objective of drinking moderation or abstinence, might in\u00ad fluence drinking outcome. The Motivational Interviewing Skill Code (MISC) quantifies communication characteristics and behaviors of counselors and patients through analyses of video or tape recordings 18-20 and includes a measure of the patient's commitment to change. Since BAI works differentially for pa\u00ad tients, it seems worthwhile to explore the rela\u00ad tionships between the communication charac\u00ad teristics during BAI, the intention at the end of BAI, and the evolution of alcohol use between baseline and follow-up. This paper has the goal of estimating whether or not an objective of alcohol use re\u00ad duction set by patients at the end ofBAI is asso\u00ad ciated with actual reduction 12 months later. However, this estimation would not allow many conclusions to be drawn regarding the content of BAI and how it influences patients' intention to change their alcohol consumption. For example, counselors might perform better during BAI iftheybelieve that a patientis ready to change; conversely, a superior performance of counselors could lead to a stronger patient commitment to change by the end ofBAI. Thus, a secondary goal is to evaluate the relationship between patients' intention to change and the communication characteristics during BAI us\u00ad ing the Motivational Interviewing Skill Code (MISC) on the 97 subjects with taped BAI. 45 Assessment: How It Works METHODS Sample This study was part of a randomized con\u00ad trolled trial in an Emergency Department (ED) aimed at evaluating the efficacy of BAI in de\u00ad creasing hazardous alcohol consumption dur\u00ad ing a l2-month follow-up, as described in detail in another paper (Daeppen et al., submitted). Briefly, there were 8,833 patients attending the ED who were screened; of these 1,366 were positive for hazardous alcohol consumption, defined according to NIAAA standards as men under 65 years old who drink more than 14 drinks per week or more than 4 drinks on asin\u00ad gle occasion in the past 30 days, and men over 65 years old and women who drink more than 7 drinks per week or more than 3 drinks on a sin\u00ad gleoccasion. One drink was defined as aregular glass of wine, a regular beer, or a single shot spirit, straight or mixed in a soft drink. After signing informed consent, 486 patients were randomized to a BAI group and 880 to two con\u00ad trolgroups; of these 367 (75.5%) oftheBAlpa\u00ad tients and 688 (78.2%) of the control successfully followed-up at 12 months. Theanalyses reportedfocus onthe367patients who completed both BAI and the follow-up in order to evaluate the difference in alcohol use from baseline to l2-months later. The local ethics committee approved theentireprotocol. Counselor Counselors were six masters level psycholo\u00ad gists and one experienced nurse, all with a mini\u00ad mum of one year of clinical practice. A senior physician and a psychologist experienced in teaching motivational interviewing and BAI trained the counselors, first with a 2-day work\u00ad shop on motivational interviewing containing exercises aimed at improving performance us\u00ad ing an active, empathic listening style that mini\u00ad mizes confrontation-! and second with a 5-day workshop focused on trial information proce\u00ad dures as well as on practice of the 6-step stan\u00ad . dardized BAL Supervision was ongoing during theproject, eitherin the presence ofpatientsor through tape recordings of the BAI. Research Procedures A single l5-minute motivational style BAI consisting of six steps was performed. At the fifth step, counselors asked patients a question about whether or not they felt ready (based on what happened in BAI) to set an objective re\u00ad garding their drinking. Patients were then dichotomized into either. the group who ex\u00ad pressed an objective to decrease or quit drink\u00ad ing (N = 134) or the group who did not (N = 233). Alcohol use was measured by the weekly drinking amount calculated as the number of standard drinks usually consumed per week and by the frequency of heavy drinking mea\u00ad sured by the average occurrence of having 5 standard drinks or more on one occasion for males under 65 years old (4 standard drinks or more on one occasion for males over 65 years old and for females) per month over the last 12-months. Patient alcohol consumption was assessed at baseline and at the 12-months fol\u00ad lOW-Up. The AUDIT score was computed at baseline and at twelve months to serve as a mea\u00ad sure of severity of alcohol use disorder. 22 The importance and readiness to change at baseline were estimated using a readiness ruler assess\u00ad ing importance and readiness to change on a 1-10 Likert scale, one being \"not important at all-not ready at all-to change my drinking now\" and 10 being \"very important-ready-to change my drinking now.\"23 Finally, the coun\u00ad selor subjectively evaluated the effectiveness ofBAI immediately after BAI and assigned pa\u00ad tients to a group that deemed BAI \"rather or very effective\" or to another group of \"all oth\u00ad ers.\" In order to explore the relationship between patients' intention to change and the communi\u00ad cation characteristics during BAI, 166 consec\u00ad utiveBAI sessions were tape-recorded with pa\u00ad tient permission and 97 of these were eligible for coding and analyses. Excluded were 33 lost to follow-up, 25 with incomplete records, 7 with mismatched identification codes, 3 who were not sufficiently fluent in French, and 1 whose wife intruded during the session. Two masters level psychologists independently completed the Motivational Interviewing Skills Code (MISC) coding, blinded to data from assessment and follow-up; both were 46 ALCOHOUDRUG SCREENING AND BRIEF INTERVENTION trained in motivational interviewing and in us\u00ad ing the MISC, Version 2.0. 19 The MISC is comprised of global ratings and behavior counts.\u00b7 Two passes were made through each taped session: the first to assess global ratings on 7 -point Likert scales and the second to assign behavior counts. For the cur\u00ad rent analyses, 9 items of counselor talk and 7 items of patient talk were selected for their clin\u00ad ical relevance to BAI. Counselor items were (I) Acceptance, (2) Empathy, and (3) MI Spirit global ratings; (4) frequency of Ml-consistent skills (Advise with permission, Affirm, Empha\u00ad size control, Open question, Simple and Com\u00ad plexReflections, and Support); (5)frequency of MI-inconsistent skills (i.e., the addition of the behavior counts Advise without permission, Confront, Direct, Raise concern without per\u00ad mission, and Warn); (6) MI-consistent skills percentage as the proportion of the sum of MI-consistent skills and MJ -inconsistent and closed questions; and (9) Complex re\u00ad flections percentage as the proportion of the sum of complex and simple reflections.P Pa\u00ad tient items were (I) Selfexploration global rat\u00ad ing and 6 behavior counts expressed as the aver\u00ad age strength of inclination measured on a scale from - 5(strong inclination awayfrom change) to + 5 (strong inclination toward change) for 6 kinds of \"Change talk\": (2) Ability or inability to change, (3) Commitment to change or not to change, (4) Desire to change or not to change, (5) Need to change versus lack of need for change, oraneednottochange, (6) Reasons to change or reasons not tochange, and (7) Taking steps toward or away from change. Data Analyses Socio-dernographic characteristics, alcohol use and related characteristics and the selected MISC variables were compared at baseline and at follow-up using Pearson's Chi, Square test for categorical variables, and Wilcoxon's non\u00ad parametric test for continuous variables since asymmetric distributions and heterogeneity of variances for the two groups were frequently seen. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) of selected MISC variables between the two cod\u00aders were high, suggesting fair to excellent inter-rater reliability, as reported elsewhere (Gaume et al., submitted). RESULTS Table I shows baseline demographics and alcohol consumption data on the 367 hazardous drinkers included in the BAI arm of the study. The sample consists mostl y of men in their late thirties, of whom about two-thirds are em\u00ad ployed and about one-third have college or equivalent education degrees.

They had relati vely low readiness ruler's scores (importance and readiness to change drinking habits) and counselors considered that BAI would be effectiveforlessthan50 % ofthem. Table 1 also compares the characteristics of the 97 patients with taped sessions to those of the 270 non-coded BAI patients and lists the relevant statistical outcomes in order to deter\u00ad mine if findings could be appropriately gener\u00ad alized tothe largersample.The groupshadsim\u00ad ilar demographic characteristics, alcohol use and AUDIT scores. However, theMISC-coded BAI group was significantly higher on the readiness ruler and showed a trend (p =.06) to\u00ad wards higher counselor ratings ofprobable BAI effectiveness than did the non-coded counter\u00ad parts. Table 2 compares patients with or without an intention to decrease their alcohol use and AUDIT scores at baseline and 12-month fol\u00ad low-up, as well as on importance and readiness to change and subjective counselor ratings at baseline. Patients with a decrease objective demonstrated significantly greater reductions in weekly drinking amounts, heavy drinking episodes per month and AUDIT scores from baseline to follow-up than did the no decrease counterparts. They also had significantly higher levels ofimportance andreadiness tochange, as well as ahigherpercentage ofcounselor ratings of BAI effectiveness. Table 2 also reveals that the decrease objec\u00ad tive group initially drank significantly more and had higher AUDIT scores than those in the 47 Assessment; How If Works TABLE 1.

Table 3 examines the communications of counselor and patients during BAI by drinking intention among the 97 taped and MISe-coded patients. Of the nine counselor speech ele\u00ad ments, no differences existed between decrease and no decrease patients on 8 of them; the single exception being that counselors used signifi\u00ad cantly more Ml-consistent skills within the de\u00ad crease group. Of the 7 patient speech elements, all but 2 (ability/inability to change and taking steps toward change) had significantly higher frequencies in the decrease objective group. Here, the patients did more self-exploration of ambivalence towards alcohol and expressed with more intensity their ability, commitment, desire, need and reason to change their drinking, compared to counterparts. DISCUSSION Results indicate that an objective of alcohol use reduction set by the patient near the end of BAI is associated with more patient self-explo\u00ad ration and change talk during BAI, higher base\u00ad line importance and readiness to change, and reduced alcohol use and problems 12 months later.

In the present study, counselor skills and communication characteristics ofpatients were both expected to be instrumental in changing drinking outcomes. It was surprising that only one ofthe9 elements (i.e.,MI-consistent skills) was significant. Perhaps counselors tend to be more empathic and motivational when they view a patient as less resistant to the whole process and more willing to change. These findings suggest that BAI might be modified such that they could increase the pro\u00ad portionofpatientswho attheend ofaBAI have a drinking objective to cut down or quit, i.e., a revision ofBAI with a special focus on change talk or a modification in BAI training with the particular aim of providing counselors with MI-consistent skills. An alternative would be a case finding strategy that selects the patients who aremorelikelytobenefitfromBAI,forex\u00ad ample, those with initial higher level of I \\ intention to change.

This suggests that objecti ves \\ to decrease alcohol use reduction are more likely to occur in individuals having higher lev\u00adf els of alcohol use and problems, while patients with less severe hazardous drinking feel less pressure to set drinking reduction objectives and to change their consumption habits. BAI may be most useful after patients reach a certain threshold of hazardous drinking and are more amenable to seeking and receiving help. Despite some methodological strengths in this study, such as efforts to maximize the inter\u00ad nal validity of BAI used (specification of the theoretical model, i.e., motivational interview\u00ad ing; uniformity of counselor training and atten\u00ad tion to fidelity of interventions during the trial), and high agreement between MISC raters, some limitations to the generalizability of these findings should be acknowledged.

This suggests that somehow the recording pro\u00ad cess itself modified the course of BAI, perhaps because patients ready to change their drinking would be more likely to accept to be recorded. Sample selectivity arising from counselor choice of patient to record can probably be ruled out, since consecutive patients were asked to do this; in any case, these group differ\u00ad ences preclude generalizing findings to the non-coded group. There were arelatively small number (97) ofMISC-coded BAI patients; this may present a statistical power problem. The confounding of higher alcohol consumption and greater readiness to change among patients who set decrease objectives makes it difficult to determine which of the two provide the greatest impetus to reduce drinking at follow-up. Several other potential limitations should be mentioned. The MISC was designed for analy\u00ad ses ofMI, not BAI, although common skills and 50 ALCOHOUDRUG SCREENING AND BRIEF INTERVENTiON common target (behavior change) of Ml and BAI suggest that the MISe might well be used to study BAI content. Using the MISe in French also might be aconcern as it is a linguis\u00ad ticcodinginstrument, developed inEnglish and so far not validated in French. Another limita\u00ad tion might arise due to the nature of ED, where time and medical constraints are quite different than those found in other settings (e.g., primary care), and might lead to specific behaviors and attitudes that unduly influence BAI. Self-selec\u00ad tion bias may have been introduced by assess\u00ad ing only patients who were willing to partici\u00ad pate and have their data recorded, and to cooperate with afollow-up one year later. Since these findings are in a relatively small sample observed prospectively, it would be helpful to repeat and expand such study to allow use of more complex statistical methods to study mechanisms of behavior change, which is cur\u00ad rently a NIAAA priority. Future BAJ research should try to probe the interaction effects of higher alcohol consumptionlhigher readiness to change scores among patients with an inten\u00ad tion to reduce alcohol use and identify predic\u00ad tors ofBAl effectiveness that could be assessed in advance of any intervention attempts. Even with these caveats, the present preliminary re\u00ad sults point to the feasibility of optimizing effectiveness and reducing the costs of BAI in ED settings by focusing on patients who are willing to change.

Schwartz, MD, JDw (See editorial comments by Dr. Richard Stefanacci on pp 1134-1136) OBJECTIVES: To compare prescription drug cost savings under the most commonly selected Medicare Part D pre- scription plan in 2006 with savings under the Medicare standard benet and with drug costs assuming no coveragein an elderly cohort of patients. DESIGN: Inception cohort study. SETTING: An academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred seventy-two patients aged 65 and older who were followed as part of a larger studyassessing stroke prevention in patients with atrial brillation. MEASUREMENTS: Prescription drug expenditures were calculated for each patient in the cohort under three con-ditions: the 2006 AARP-endorsed prescription drug plan, the Medicare standard benet, and no prescription drug coverage. RESULTS: Total prescriptions drug costs were lower under the AARP plan, yet patients paid a similar percentage of total costs under the AARP plan and the Medicare standardbenet. Using different cost assessments, 27% to 46% of patients entered the ''doughnut hole'' in the AARP plan, and 3% to 11% emerged to receive catastrophic coverage. CONCLUSION: Both the AARP-sponsored and standard Medicare Part D prescription drug benet programs offer significant savings to enrollees. A greater savings is achievedunder the private AARP drug insurance plan, largely due to greater discounts reflected in the negotiated drug prices. A substantial portion of enrollees enter but do not emergefrom the coverage gap. J Am Geriatr Soc 55:1038-1043, 2007. drug; atrial brillation In 2006, Medicare patients were given the opportunity to purchase insurance coverage for prescription drugs under Medicare Part D (enacted as the Medicare PrescriptionDrug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA)). 1,2Given that many seniors, more than 25% ac- cording to some studies, previously lacked drug coverage,3 the new benet promised to provide urgently needed relieffor many Medicare beneciaries. When enacted in 2003, the legislation envisioned a standard set of benets provided by private insurance com-panies. Under the standard benet, patients would pay the rst $250 of drug expenses, with this expenditure serving as a deductible. Of the next $2,000 of patient drug costs (up toa patient outlay of $2,250), Medicare would cover 75% (or $1,500), leaving the patient to pay 25% ($500) as coinsur- ance. At this point, a beneciary would encounter the''doughnut hole'' gap in coverage; there would be no coverage between total outlays of $2,250 and $5,100. After incurring more than $5,100 in total drug costs, a patient would have95% of their costs covered by Medicare and would pay 5%as coinsurance (Table 1). To enroll in the plan, patients would pay a monthly premium, which at the time of the bill's passage in 2003 was estimated to be approximately$35 per month. In 2005, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimated that the premium would be $32 per month, or $384 annually. Therefore, un-der the standard Part D benet, a patient would pay $3,600 ($250 deductible plus $500 coinsurance plus $2,850 in the doughnut hole) of drug costs up to $5,100, for a total of$3,984 including the annual premium of $384. 2Address correspondence to Gregory R.

JAGS 55:1038-1043, 2007 r2007, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation r2007, The American Geriatrics Society 0002-8614/07/$15.00As an incentive to develop enhanced benets for par- ticipants, a variety of differently structured plans have beenoffered, each with a unique premium structure, deductible policy, formulary, and method of entering and exiting the coverage gap, or doughnut hole. 4-6There are four basic plan structures: a standard benet, based on the original legislation; actuarily equivalent plans, which adhere to the standard benet with respect to deductibles and the dough-nut hole but offer enhanced cost sharing; basic alternative plans, in which deductibles and cost sharing are altered; and enhanced alternative plans, which exceed the dened stan-dard benet. 7 The economic benets of offering these private plans have been estimated based on hypothetical patients.1,8In this study, we report the estimated benet one private planwould have in a prospectively identied cohort of actual patients with the predened cardiovascular diagnosis of atrial brillation (AF). The prevalence of this condition in-creases with age, and it is estimated that 7.5 million Amer- icans will have AF by 2020. 9-12For the purposes of the analysis, the 2006 version of the basic alternative plan en-dorsed by the AARP and administered by UnitedHealth Group was used. As of September 2006, 3.4 million people were enrolled in this plan, which was available in all 50states and had the leading market share, with 21% of total enrollees. 8 METHODS Study Participants Consecutive patients were prospectively identied as part of a larger study assessing stroke prevention in individuals with AF during January 2001 to June 2003 from dailysearches of electronic hospital discharge summaries andpatient referrals to an anticoagulation clinic. To be eligible, patients had to be aged 65 and older and have AF veried according to electrocardiogram. Demographic data and di-agnoses were extracted from the medical record. Medication Ascertainment At the time of enrollment, a complete list of current med- ications was recorded and veried in the electronic medical record. Dosages were not recorded. During the analysis, toprovide the most conservative estimate of annual prescrip- tion costs, short-term medications such as antibiotics andmedications taken on an as-needed basis were not included. Injectable medications, other than insulin, and medications that have been withdrawn from the market were also ex-cluded. Because dosages were not recorded, two doses were analyzed for each medication: the usual starting (minimum) dose and the maximum acceptable dose. Prescription Plan Cost Comparisons Total annual drug costs were calculated for each patientunder three conditions: the AARP plan, the Medicare Part D standard benet (Table 1), and no prescription coverage. For each condition, calculations were performed twice, us-ing minimum and maximum cost assumptions. Under the minimum assumption, the minimum dose was assumed for all drugs. Under the maximum assumption, the maximumdose was assumed. For the majority of medications, the minimum dose was associated with the lowest cost. For a small number of drugs, the minimum dose was priced high-er. Under this circumstance, the minimum dose was desig- nated as the maximum cost, with the maximum dose being designated as the minimum cost. The portion paid by thepatient, in the form of premiums, copayments, and nonre-imbursed out-of-pocket payments, were also determined using the relevant drug prices and plan rules. The amount paid by the plan was calculated by subtracting patient pay-ments from total aggregate drug costs. For the standard-benet and no-coverage conditions, retail pricing information was obtained from drug-store.com, an on-line mail-order pharmacy, during March through July 2006. To avoid overestimation of costs, prices from drugstore.com were compared with those of a na-tional retail chain and the adjusted average wholesale price(AWP) for the 20 most commonly prescribed medications. For 80% of medications, the drugstore.com price was the lowest. For the remaining medications, the drugstore.comprice varied less than 6% from the lowest price. Using the drugstore.com prices, annual retail medication costs were calculated for each patient in the cohort. If a particularmedication was not available through drugstore.com, a price was obtained using the adjusted AWP. Based on a previously published analysis, 4% was added to the AWPTable 1.

The 2006 AARP plan had three phases of coverage: the initial coverage phase, annual coverage gap (doughnut hole), and catastrophic protection phase. The details of thisplan are outlined in Table 1. During the initial phase, pa- tients pay a copayment for medications according to a tier categorization. When drug costs reach $2,250, patients en-ter the annual coverage gap and remain there until they pay$3,600 in true out-of-pocket costs (dened as the amount the patient pays in co-insurance during the initial coverage period and the amount paid in the coverage gap). While inthe coverage gap, patients pay 100% of the network dis- counted price (NDP) for each prescription until they reach $3,600 in out-of-pocket costs. At that point, patients moveinto the catastrophic protection phase, in which they pay a copayment or percentage of the NDP (Table 1). 14Study investigators obtained the NDP for the minimum and max-imum doses of each medication (N 5456) through phone calls to the AARP telephone customer service center. To examine the effects of the doughnut hole structure of the AARP plan, each patient's medication costs werecalculated on a monthly basis, and the amount paid by the patient and plan each month was determined. If a patient's drug costs reached $2,250 during a month (the patient en-tered the doughnut hole), or the out-of-pocket expenses exceeded $3,600 (the patient exited the hole), the drug costs were added in a sequence that maximized the benet. The institutional review board at Massachusetts Gen- eral Hospital approved the study. The nature of the study did not require written informed consent. RESULTS Patient Clinical Characteristics During the study period, 472 patients were enrolled, of whom 47% were female. Forty-two percent of patientswere aged 65 to 74, 25% were aged 75 to 79, and 33% were aged 80 and older The most common medical diagnoses (in addition to AF) were hypertension (75%), coronary arterydisease (35%), heart failure (27%), and diabetes mellitus (22%). Patients were taking a median of ve prescription medications daily (range 1 to 15, Figure 1). There was nodifference in the number of medications across age groups.The most commonly prescribed medication classes, besides warfarin, which every participant was prescribed, were be- ta-blockers, diuretics, anti-arrhythmics, and anti-hyper-lipidemics. Patient Drug Costs Overall, generic assigned for 76% of medica- tions. Diuretics, and proton-pump inhibitors, anti-hyper- lipidemics, anti-platelet, and osteoporosis medications had the highest monthly costs. Under the AARP plan, 69% of medications for the co- hort were categorized as Tier 1 medications. Only 3% of medications were in the most expensive Specialty Tier ornot covered at all. The AARP plan did not cover 62 med- ications, with the majority being benzodiazepines. Table 2 shows the cost comparison between the AARP plan, the standard benet, and no prescription drug cover- age. Under the minimum projection, total annual drug costsunder the AARP plan for the cohort were $813,124, com- pared with $937,225 under the standard benet and $937,225 in the no coverage condition. Using the maxi-mum projection, total costs under the AARP plan were $1,237,741, compared with $1,487,858 under the standard benet and $1,487,858 in the no coverage condition. Totalannual drug costs were the same for the standard benetand no-coverage conditions, because prices were the same in both conditions. There was a 13% savings under the minimum cost projection and a 17% savings under themaximum projection. Under the AARP plan, the patients paid 71% of drug costs under the minimum projection and 62% under the maximum projection. The median annualcost per patient was $908 under the minimum projection and $1,092 under the maximum projection. Under the standard benet, the patients paid 69% of total drug costsunder the minimum projection and 64% under the maxi- mum projection. The annual median cost per patient under the standard benet was $956 under the minimum projec-tion and $1,456 under the maximum projection. Underconditions of no prescription drug coverage, patients paid 100% of costs, and the median cost per patient was $1,539 under the minimum projection and $2,572 under the max-imum projection. A compelling characteristic of the MMA is the cover- age gap, or doughnut hole, which represents the period aftera patient accrues $2,250 in total drug costs. Under the AARP plan, using the minimum projection, 73% of patients in the cohort remained in the initial coverage phase for theentire year, whereas 27% of patients in the cohort enteredthe coverage gap. Of those who entered the coverage gap, the majority (89%) ended the year in the gap, whereas 11% entered and exited the doughnut hole. Under the maximumprojection, 46% of patients in the cohort entered the hole.051015Percent 0 5 10 15 Number of Medications Figure 1. Median number of prescriptions per patient.

Thus, underthe minimum projection, 3% of the total cohort ended the year in the catastrophic coverage phase, and under the maximum projection, 11% of the total cohort ended theyear in the catastrophic coverage phase. The medianmonthly expenditure for patients who never entered the doughnut hole (using the minimum cost projection) was $65. For those who entered, the median monthly paymentwas $134 (range $61-280) before entering the hole and $294 (range $105-780) while in the hole. The median in- crease in monthly payments upon entering the hole was$166 (range $0-578) or 125% (range 5-483%). Three pa- tients entered the hole during the 12th calendar month but did not experience an increase in cost because several oftheir medications were priced below the Tier 1 copayment. Payments dropped considerably for those who exited the hole. The median monthly payment was reduced to $56(range $48-248). On average, those who ended the year inthe hole arrived there in approximately calendar month 9, whereas those who entered and exited arrived in approx- imately calendar month 5 and exited in approximately cal-endar month 11. Under the minimum cost assessment, 490 person-months were spent in the coverage gap, and under the maximum cost assessment, 996 person-months werespent in the coverage gap, or doughnut hole. DISCUSSION An assessment of the effect of the Medicare prescription drug plan on an elderly cohort of patients recruited as part of a larger study to assess stroke prevention in individualswith AF is presented here. Drug costs incurred under the 2006 AARP-endorsed plan were compared with costs in- curred under the Medicare standard benet and with costprojections assuming no prescription drug coverage. This comparison revealed that patients in this cohort benetsignificantly from the AARP plan and the standard benet, with a slightly greater benet from the AARP plan. Under the AARP plan, median annual patient expenditures de-creased 41% under the minimum projection and 57% un-der the maximum projection. This is compared with 38% under the minimum projection and 43% under the maxi- mum projection with the standard benet. These numbersare less than those estimated in a recent CMS analysis of 16 hypothetical patients with a variety of comorbid condi- tions, in which an average 60% savings was predicted, witha maximum savings of 72%. 15 Regulations have allowed private insurance companies to offer plans with actuarially equivalent or better benets.This analysis of the AARP plan, which had the leading market share in 2006, with more than 3.4 million enrollees, or 21% of total Part D participants, suggests that patientshave lower median annual drug expenditures under thisplan than under the standard benet. Total drug costs were 13% less in the AARP plan under the minimum projection than with the standard benet and 17% less under themaximum projection. There are limitations in the analysis that may under- estimate the savings seen with the AARP plan. First, theanalysis used pricing information from drugstore.com to calculate drug costs under the standard benet and when patients had no coverage. Drugstore.com often offers lowerprices than neighborhood retail pharmacies, so even greatersavings might be realized for patients using a local phar- macy. CMS also uses pricing information from drug- store.com, as well as from Costco.com, another on-linemail-order pharmacy, for their analyses. 15Second, annual costs were analyzed based on the medication list of each participant upon enrollment. Medications taken on anTable 2.

The network discounted prices were obtained from the AARP customer service center and used for calculations under the AARP plan; under the stand ard benet and no coverage categories, prices were obtained from drugstore.comTHE NEW MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT 1041 JAGS JULY 2007-VOL. 55, NO. 7as-needed basis or for an acute illness were not included. This assumption could lead to lower estimates for drug costs in this cohort. By using only the medication list at thetime of enrollment, it was also not possible to capture sav- ings that would occur as a result of patient and physician behavioral changes. In reality, patients could switch to al-ternative medications within a therapeutic class to achieve greater savings in copayments with the AARP plan. Seven- ty-six percent of the medications used by this cohort wereavailable as generics, and the majority of medications werecategorized in Tier 1. The nding that patients save more with the AARP plan than with the standard benet shows that the governmentsubsidy is not the only driver of savings. A substantial por- tion of patients' savings appears to come from the lower network prices that plans are able to obtain for their mem-bers. In the aggregate, under the minimum projection, total drug costs dropped from $937,225 with the standard ben- et (based on drugstore.com prices) to $813,124 with theAARP plan (based on the NDP) (Table 2). Thus, nearly$125,000 of savings was due solely to the price discount obtained by the private plan through negotiated savings from drug manufacturers. Because actual prices paid byprivate insurers to pharmaceutical manufactures are not available, it is impossible to calculate the true percentage of costs assumed by the plan. 5Despite this, both plans, under the minimum projection, fall short of previous calculations that predict a subsidy of $1,092 per person and short of the CMS projections using hypothetical patients.15,16The me- dian subsidy in the minimum cost projection is $631 and $583 for the AARP and standard benet, respectively. Un- der the maximum projection, though, this median subsidy is$1,486 (AARP) and $1,116 (standard benet), highlightingthe basic plan structure that those who spend more save more. An essential component of Medicare Part D is the cov- erage gap, or doughnut hole. Although this hole makes the overall benet less costly to the government, it raises im- portant clinical and safety concerns. The nancial burden ofmedications can lead to nonadherence, as evidenced in a recent analysis of Medicare Advantage patients, whose pharmacy benets were capped at $1,000. The presence ofthis cap led to worse adherence and clinical outcomes, in-cluding poorer control of blood pressure, lipid, and blood glucose levels. Patients exceeding the cap had higher rates of nonelective hospitalizations, visits to the emergency de-partment, and death. The cost of these hospitalizations and emergency department visits offset the prescription drug savings. 17 In the current study's cohort, 27% of patients in the minimum projection and 46% of patients in the maximum projection fell into the doughnut hole. Only 3% of patientsin the minimum projection and 11% of patients in the maximum projection emerged from the hole with cata- strophic coverage by the end of the year; the rest remainedin the hole, paying full price for their medications. The me-dian increase in monthly payments upon entering the hole was 125%. Savings under Part D come with a cost. The AARP plan, like most private plans, limits patients' choices of medication through formularies and tiered copayments. More than 30% of the medications for the cohort were notcategorized as Tier 1, and 62 medications, the majority of them benzodiazepines, were not covered at all. Tiered co- payments are designed to shift patients' drug choices tolower-cost alternatives, but each time a change is made, a potential for a disruption in care is introduced. Despite all the criticisms of the MMA, these data sug- gest that it has the potential to reduce patient drug costs significantly. This analysis of the effect of Medicare Part D on real patients with common comorbidities underscoresthe significant savings achieved by allowing private insurersto negotiate steep price discounts with drug manufacturers. The AARP plan is just one example; as the most popular plan in 2006, its savings suggest that other private planswith negotiated prices are also likely to provide savings to patients. This analysis shows that the percentage of patients affected by the coverage gap ranges from 25% to 50%,underscoring the importance of creating alternative solu- tions to this lapse in coverage. Continued research is needed to determine the effect of Medicare Part D on health outcomes, physician prescribingpractices, and drug usage patterns in elderly populations.

ABSTRACT OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the outcomes of patients who have hemorrhagic complications while receiving warfarin therapy. We examined the rates of death and disability resulting from warfarin-associated intracranial and extracranial hemorrhages in a large cohort of patients with atrial brillation.METHODS: We assembled a cohort of 13,559 adults with atrial brillation and major extracranial hemorrhage. Data onfunctional disability at discharge and 30-day mortality were obtained from a review of medical charts andstate death certicates. The relative odds of 30-day mortality by hemorrhage type were calculated usingmultivariable logistic regression.RESULTS: We identied 72 intracranial and 98 major hemorrhages occurring in more than 15,300 person-years of warfarin exposure. At hospital discharge, 76% of patients with intracranialhemorrhage had severe disability or died, compared with only 3% of those with major extracranialhemorrhage. Of the 40 deaths from warfarin-associated hemorrhage that occurred within 30 days, 35 (88%)were hemorrhage. Compared with extracranial hemorrhages, intracranial 20.8 [95% condence interval, 6.0-72]) even afteradjusting for age, sex, intensity on admission, and other illnesses.CONCLUSIONS: Among with atrial brillation, 90% of the deaths from warfarin-associated hemorrhage and the majority of disability amongsurvivors.

Rates of ischemic stroke in patients with atrial brillation who are not taking warfarin can be as high as 12% peryear, 2,3and the proportion of patients who have major functional disability after an atrial brillation-related isch-emic stroke is substantial, as high as 59%. 4Yet multipleThis work was supported by Public Health Services research grant AG15478 from the National Institute on Aging, the Eliot B. and Edith C.Shoolman Fund of Massachusetts General Hospital, and a Hartford Geri-atrics Health Outcomes Research Scholars Award from the AGS Founda-tion for Health in Aging.

All rights reserved.doi:10.1016/j.amjmed.2006.07.034The American Journal of Medicine (2007) 120, 700-705studies demonstrate that patients with atrial brillation are frequently not prescribed warfarin despite its benetsin ischemic stroke risk reduction. 5-7The primary deter- rent to prescribing warfarin is the fear of inducing life-threatening hemorrhage. 8 Although concerns about hem- orrhage prevent many patientsfrom receiving warfarin, there arerelatively little data about the ac-tual rates of death and disabilityresulting from warfarin-associatedhemorrhage, particularly amongpatients with atrial widelyconsidered more severe than hemorrhages, few stud-ies have been able to quantify in outcomes be-tween intracranial and extracranialtypes of hemorrhage. Most studies lacked sufcient numbers of hemor-rhagic events to examine the differ-ences in mortality and morbidity;for example, a pooled analysis of 5randomized trials of warfarin foratrial brillation reported a total 6 intracranial oc-curring with warfarin therapy. 2Our objective was to quantify the risk of death and major disability occurring from warfarin-associated intracranial and extracranial hemorrhages. Such in-formation should allow for more rational choices about theappropriateness of warfarin therapy in patients with atrialbrillation. METHODS Cohort Assembly and Ascertainment of Patient Characteristics The AnTicoagulation and Risk Factors In Atrial Fibrillation (ATRIA) Study is a cohort of 13,559 adults with diagnosednonvalvular atrial brillation who received care within Kai-ser Permanente of Northern California, a large integratedhealth care delivery system. Details of the cohort assemblyhave been described. 9Cohort members were identied by searching automated inpatient, outpatient, and electrocar-diographic databases for physician-assigned International Classication of Ninth Revisions, Clinical Modi-cation diagnoses of atrial brillation (427.31) between July 1, 1996, and December 31, Because we wereinterested in nontransient, nonvalvular post-operative atrial brillation, or concurrent hyperthyroidism.The cohort was followed through August 31, 1999, pro- viding a median follow-up of 2.4 years (interquartile range1.8-2.8 years). Data on patient age and sex were obtainedfrom administrative databases, and data on comorbid med-ical conditions were collected from validated clinical inpa- tient and ambulatory databases. 9 To specically address warfarin-associated hemorrhage, we re-stricted our analyses to periodsof time in which patients wereexposed to warfarin, as deter-mined using a previously Hemorrhagic We potential hemor- searching automated forprimary and farin exposure was conrmedthrough review of the admissionmedical record. We searched only for primary diagnoses of extracra-nial hemorrhage, because in a re- view of 110 randomly selected hospitalizations with only asecondary discharge diagnosis of extracranial hemorrhage,only 4.4% of these were valid major hemorrhagic were categorized as intracerebral,subdural, or other (eg, subarachnoid) on the basis of radi-ology reports obtained from the medical records. Intracra-nial hemorrhages caused by signicant head We denedmajor extracranial hemorrhage as fatal, requiring transfu-sion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells, orhemorrhage into a critical anatomic site, such as the retro-peritoneum. To restrict analyses to the most serious hem-orrhages, events not leading to hospitalization or death wereexcluded. Because Kaiser Permanente is an integratedhealth care network, cohort members admitted to facilitiesoutside of the network were still identied by our searchstrategy. The emergency department and hospitalization medical records for each potential event were reviewed by a 3-physi-cian Clinical Outcomes committee. Each event was indepen-dently validated by 2 physicians on the committee using aformal study protocol, and disagreements were resolved by a consensus of all 3 committee members. The international nor-malized ratio (INR) at presentation and before reversal ofanticoagulation was obtained from medical records, emer-gency department records, or the inpatient health plan labora-tory Warfarin-associated intracranial hemor- rhages uncommon but types of warfarin-associated bleeding. Because extracranial hemorrhages rarelylead to death or signicant risk for extracranial hemorrhagesshould be less emphasized when consid-ering the use of oral vitamin K antago-nists to prevent stroke in patients withatrial brillation. Our results highlight the critical need tond better predictors of intracranialhemorrhage and improve risk stratica-tion in individual patients.701 Fang et al Outcomes of Warfarin-Associated HemorrhageEach patient's functional disability at the time of dis- charge was determined on the basis of a physician's reviewof the medical records, including review of documentationfrom physician, nursing, physical/occupational therapy, andsocial work services. Functional disability at the time ofdischarge was categorized using a modied Rankin scale 11; the categories were fatal inpatient event, major disability(ie, decit that prevented independent living), minor dis-ability (ie, residual decit that did not interfere withindependent living), and no disability. This assessment offunctional disability has been strongly associated withsubsequent death within 30 days in patients admitted withatrial brillation-associated ischemic stroke. 4For 13 pa- tients, the available clinical information was insufcient todetermine the extent of functional impairment, and thesepatients were excluded from the analysis of disability.Deaths during the hospitalization and at 30 days after theevent were determined through reviewing medical charts,health plan databases, and the comprehensive CaliforniaState death certicate registry. 12Data on mortality were complete for all patients. Statistical Analyses Incidence rates of intracranial and major extracranial hem-orrhage were calculated as the number of events occurringper 100 person-years of follow-up. We compared functionaldisability at discharge between patients with intracranialversus extracranial hemorrhagic events using the chi-squared test for categorical variables. We then used multi-variable logistic regression to quantify the relative impact ofintracranial versus extracranial hemorrhage on 30-day mor-tality, adjusted for age, INR, and comorbid conditions. Toavoid potential overtting of the model, we included in themultivariable model only comorbid conditions that differedbetween patients with intracranial and extracranial hemor-rhages at a Pvalue of less than .1 on bivariate analyses. All analyses were conducted using SAS statistical soft- ware, version 9.1 (Cary, NC). This study was approved byinstitutional review boards of the collaborating institutions.RESULTS During the study period, we identied 72 patients hospital- with these, (21%) were types of intracranial hemorrhages. Wealso identied 98 0.53%-0.78%). Of these, 87 (89%) involved the gastrointestinaltract. The median age did not differ signicantly for patientswith intracranial hemorrhage compared with extracranialhemorrhage ( ). Compared with patients sustaining an intracranial hemorrhage, more patients with extracranialhemorrhages were female, had a history of diabetes andprior gastrointestinal bleed, and had higher median INRs atpresentation, although these comparisons did not reach sta-tistical signicance ( Table 1 ). Outcomes After Major Hemorrhage Although the overall mortality rate from warfarin-associ- ated hemorrhage was low, the majority of deaths occurredfrom hemorrhage. Of the 40 (88%) died ofintracranial hemorrhage (annualized mortality rate of 0.23%[95% CI, 0.16%-0.32%]) and only 5 died of major (annualized strongly associated with 30-day mor-tality compared with extracranial hemorrhage even afteradjusting for differences in other covariates (age, dia-betes mellitus, prior gastrointestinal bleed, and INR at pre-sentation), with an adjusted odds ratio of 20.8 CI,6.0-72.2]. Among patients sustaining an intracranial vs 26.7%, respec-tively, P/H11005.04). hospital discharge, patients with intracra- nial hemorrhage had far more severe functional decits than Table 1 Comparison of Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation Who Were Hospitalized for Intracranial Hemorrhage Hemorrhage While age (interquartile range) 77 (69-82) 77 (71-79) .6 Female (%) 32 45 .09Prior stroke (%) 25 19 .4Prior gastrointestinal bleed (%) 5 14 .07Congestive heart failure (%) 42 54 .1Hypertension (%) 67 68 .8Coronary artery disease (%) 35 46 .2Diabetes mellitus (%) 19 .06Median INR (interquartile range) 2.7 (2.3-4.0) 3.4 (2.2-5.1) .1702 The American Journal of Medicine, Vol 120, No 8, August 2007did patients with major extracranial hemorrhage ( Figure 2 ). With the exclusion of 13 patients whose discharge disabilitywas unavailable, 26 patients (42%) with intracranial hem-orrhage had a fatal inpatient event only 2patients (2%) with extracranial hemorrhages. Among the129 survivors at the time of discharge, 21 patients (61%)with an intracranial hemorrhage had major functional dis-ability compared with 1 patient (1%) with a majorextracranial hemorrhage ( P/H11021.001). Moreover, among the 21 patients who had major disability from intracranial hem-orrhage at the time of discharge, 7 died within 30 days. DISCUSSION Intracranial hemorrhages accounted for approximately 90%of the deaths caused by warfarin-associated hemorrhage,and most of the functional disability among survivors in thiscohort of patients taking warfarin for atrial brillation. Al-though the overall rate of hemorrhagic events in the cohortwas relatively low, of those patients who sustained a com-plication from warfarin, intracranial hemorrhage was theprimary determinant of death and disability. The approximately 50% mortality rate from warfarin- associated intracranial hemorrhage in this study is compa-rable to that observed in other settings. 13-16Although intra- cranial hemorrhages are generally rare events, the adverseconsequences resulting from them are considerably higherthan those observed from the more common extracranialhemorrhage events. Extracranial hemorrhages, primarily ofgastrointestinal origin in this study, are more likely to beremediable events, making residual decits uncommon. Theoverall rate of fatal hemorrhage in this present study ap-proximates the rates reported in a recent study from theLeiden Anticoagulation clinic, although that study was notrestricted to patients with atrial brillation, used higherINR target ranges, and did not examine bleeding-relateddisability. 17Data on the expected outcomes from warfarin-associated hemorrhage are vital to improving how clinicians and pa-tients decide on the use of antithrombotic therapy for atrialbrillation. Atrial brillation-related ischemic stroke is as-sociated with a signicant risk of death and major disability,with worse outcomes if the strokes occur while the patientis not taking warfarin. 4These risks must be balanced against the risk and impact of warfarin-associated hemorrhage. Pre-vious studies generally weighed the risk of ischemic strokeagainst the risk of all major hemorrhages. Our data demon-strate that it is intracranial hemorrhage that overwhelm- ingly determines poor outcomes from as aresult, the risk of non-intracranial hemorrhage shouldhave a relatively small effect on decisions about warfarintherapy in atrial brillation. Although extracranial hem-orrhages certainly result in hospitalizations, invasive pro-cedures, and discontinuation of antithrombotic therapy, 18 the longer-term functional impact of such hemorrhages isgenerally much less than that of intracranial hemorrhagesor ischemic strokes. Investigations by Devereaux andcolleagues 19reveal that patients are much more willing than physicians to accept a far higher risk of gastrointes-tinal hemorrhage in return for an associated reduction inthe risk of stroke. The rates of intracranial hemorrhage on warfarin ob- served in our study were still considerably lower than therates of ischemic stroke while the patient was not takingwarfarin. As previously reported, the rate of thromboembo-lism occurring without warfarin therapy was 2.5 per 100person-years in the overall ATRIA cohort 10and even higher in other cohorts2,20-22; these rates are reduced by more than 50% by warfarin therapy.10,23This benet 100 person-years without warfarin therapy), 10,24and the balance of risk to benet seems to favor the use of Figure 2 Functional decit at the time of discharge resulting from warfarin-associated intracranial hemorrhage versus majorextracranial hemorrhage refers comparison intracranial and extracranial hemorrhage events.

The infrequency of intracranial hemorrhage makes a priori prediction challenging for the individual patient.Older age, elevated INR level, and history of ischemicstroke have all been identied as risk factors for intra-cranial hemorrhage, but because older age and priorstroke are also risk factors for ischemic stroke, additionalinvestigation into unique risk factors for intracranialhemorrhage is clearly needed. 2,15,24Modiable measures, such as maintaining anticoagulation intensity within thetherapeutic range of INR 2.0 to 3.0, can reduce but willnot entirely remove the risk of bleeding associated with warfarin. 15,25A study of Medicare patients with atrial brillation showed that a high fall risk was associatedwith an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage, 16al- though the high rate of ischemic stroke (13.7 per 100person-years) among this subset of patients with a highfall risk made warfarin the preferred option for mostpatients. Some evidence suggests that testing for theapolipoprotein E genotype or detecting cerebral amyloidangiopathy and leukoaraiosis on brain imaging studiesmight help rene existing prediction rules for hemor-rhage. 26-28Future validation of the effectiveness of in- corporating such predictors into clinical practice isclearly needed to help improve current risk straticationfor intracranial hemorrhage. Our study was strengthened by including the number of validated warfarin-related hemorrhages amongpatients with atrial brillation reported to date. Patientswere managed using current INR targets, and there wascomprehensive assessment of relevant clinical featuresand subsequent outcomes. However, our study also hadseveral limitations. As an observational study of actualclinical practice, clinicians in our study may have selec-tively avoided prescribing warfarin to patients at thehighest risk for poor outcomes from extracranial hemor-rhages. Our observations took place in a health caresetting where anticoagulation was predominantly man-aged by centralized anticoagulation clinics, which maybetter maintain anticoagulation levels in a therapeuticrange. 29,30However, it is unlikely that these limitations would invalidate the markedly more severe impact ofintracranial compared with extracranial hemorrhages. Fi-nally, it is possible that our screening strategy, whichidentied only hospitalizations for a primary diagnosis ofextracranial hemorrhage, could have missed some ex-tracranial hemorrhage events, although prior validationstudies of the ATRIA cohort indicate that these exclu-sions missed only a small fraction of the total number ofmajor extracranial bleeds. 10CONCLUSION Intracranial hemorrhages poor outcomes from warfarin-associated hemorrhage, re-sulting in substantially higher rates of death and disabilitythan major extracranial hemorrhages. As a consequence,rather than basing the anticoagulation decision on a pa-tient's risk for hemorrhage of all types, clinicians shoulddepend primarily on a comparison of the patient's ischemicstroke risk without warfarin therapy with the risk of intra-cranial hemorrhage with warfarin therapy. Further work isneeded to develop better ways to identify patients at thegreatest risk for intracranial hemorrhage and more effectivemethods to mitigate its severe consequences. References 1.

The negative effect of mental health disorders is felt both in the personal and public lives of the affected in-dividuals, particularly in the workplace where it adverselyimpacts productivity.

More than 54 million Americans (1 in 5) have a mental health disorder in a given year [ 2]. and approximately 15% of all adults who have a mental health disorder also experience a co-occurring sub- stance (alcohol or drug) abuse disorder which complicates treatment [ 3]. Data on functional impairment in the population demon- strate that up to 9% of U.S. adults experience signicant functional impairment as a result of mental health disorders. Of these individuals, 7% suffer from chronic mental disor-ders (for at least one year) [ 6]. There is also evidence that untreated comorbid mental health disorders are associated with poorer outcomes among individuals with physical dis-orders [ 7]. Although mental health disorders are treatable, only about 8 million individuals with mental health disor- ders (16%) seek treatment [ 3]. The cost of these untreated individuals to employers and the nation's economy is stag-gering [ 8,9]. In most circumstances, however, mental health issues, although treatable, are neglected in the workplace until they cause signicant problems such as reduced pro-ductivity and/or absenteeism [ 10,11]. To respond to this epidemic, some employers have taken on the responsibility of addressing employees' psychologi-cal and emotional well-being by establishing Employee As- sistance Programs (EAPs) or other activities such as An- nual Depression Screening Days. Yet, even these programshave generally not addressed the substantially high barriers Springer50 J Med Syst (2007) 31:49-62 to the detection and treatment of mental disorders in the workplace. Although EAPs are geared to helping employ-ees with personal, family and work concerns, most workersdo not take advantage of the services provided by the EAPs or other employer-sponsored resources [ 12]. Also, many in- house programs are cost-conscious and thus only devote theirresources to immediate and obvious problems [ 13]. Often, other barriers such as the stigma of mental and emotional health problems, and/or the employees' lack of knowledgeabout EAPs prevent them from seeking help in the work en- vironment. There is a clear need for comprehensive but cost- efcient workplace programs for the detection and treatmentof mental health disorders that address all employees andpreserve privacy. This paper describes the design and development of a condential workplace program that focuses on workplaceproductivity and symptom improvement of employees who have undiagnosed and/or untreated (or partially treated) men- tal health disorders. The program uses a computer-assistedtelephonic system, based upon Interactive V oice Response (IVR) to assess workers for a mental health disorder that could adversely impact their workplace performance. Theprogram then refers affected workers who are untreated orwho are inadequately treated to appropriate treatment set- tings. The development of this system is supported by a grant funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), R01 DP000116. The grant proposal was a response to a well-publicized CDC initiative with the principal goal of assisting employers to address factors that negatively im-pact employees' productivity. The ultimate objective of this system is to increase productivity by reducing absenteeism and partial functionality (presenteeism) related to untreatedor undertreated mental illness in the employee population. The Telephone- Linked Communications for Detection of Mental Health Disorders in the Workplace (TLC-Detect) as- sesses each participating employee for a group of relevantmental health disorders by administering a panel of reli- able and validated assessment instruments. If an employee screens positive for a mental health disorder, the system pro-vides information, education and referrals to a variety of mental health care resources and treatment options speci- cally for that disorder. The system also motivates employeesto engage in treatment and implements automated periodicfollow-ups to monitor mental health symptom severity and treatment maintenance. Finally, the system motivates the em- ployees to remain in treatment. The TLC-Detect program is being evaluated in a ran- domized controlled trial to examine its impact on produc- tivity measures (absenteeism and presenteeism), the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and the feasibility of using TLC-Detect in a workplace setting. Below, we will describe the TLC technology on which the mental health assessmentsystem is based.The TLC technology: An overview The Telephone-linked communications (TLC) system TLC is a totally automated telecommunications system that has been used to screen patients and consumers (individualswho do not have a known health condition) with specic health conditions, promote self-care behaviors, help patients and consumers modify their unhealthy behaviors and moni-tor patients with chronic disease and alerting their providers about clinical problems [ 14,15]. The TLC health condi- tion assessment applications have been applied to the as-sessment of problem drinking behavior [ 16], chemotherapy related symptoms [ 17] and depression symptoms [ 18]. TLC applications that address patient/consumer behavior modi- cation include systems for diet and physical activity [ 19,20], smoking cessation [ 21]. on time mammography, medication adherence in hypertension [ 22], depression [ 23], and other chronic diseases as well as maintenance of healthy behavior.The TLC disease management applications include those for angina, COPD [ 24], children asthma, etc. During TLC conversations, TLC speaks to the users over the telephone using computer-controlled pre-recorded hu-man speech. The users communicate with TLC by speaking into the telephone receiver or by using the touch tone key- pad. TLC conversations last from a few minutes to 30 mindepending on the particular TLC program. In addition to asking questions, TLC provides information, advice, and de- pending on the program, behavioral counseling. The specicquestions and the responses given to the user depend upon the behavioral theory or model used in the program design as well as what the user reported during previous conversations,and earlier during the same conversation. TLC combines aninteractive voice response (IVR) subsystem for generating speech over the telephone, a speech recognition subsystem for recognizing what the user is saying, a database manage-ment subsystem for storing and managing system and user data, and a conversation control subsystem. The design of the TLC behavioral interventions is based on behavioral the-ory (the Transtheoretical Model [ 25,26]), Social Cognitive Theory [ 27], and on the heuristics of experienced counselors, including telephone counselors. TLC-Detect's design objectives: General considerations TLC-Detect is designed to deliver an interactive, conden- tial and standardized mental health assessment and treatment promotion program to employees over time. The system maybe accessed from work or from home or anywhere else de- pending on the user's preference as it involves only a tele- phone call. TLC-Detect was deliberately designed to respondto keypad data entry in lieu of speech recognition because the SpringerJ Med Syst (2007) 31:49-62 51 designers understood the employees' concerns about con- dentiality and because pressing the numbers on the keypad,even when people are at work, can be carried out without anydisclosure of the subject matter to those who may be nearby. The principal objectives of the TLC-Detect system are: 1) to screen employees of a participating organization forthe presence of a mental or emotional disorder, and 2) to persuade them to seek help. The system was designed to screen both the employees who have never been screenedpositive for a mental/emotional health disorder as well as those who may have been diagnosed with a mental health disorder (and were possibly treated) but are not currently un-der treatment. The goal is for the system to assist a distressedemployee by evaluating his or her condition for the presence of symptom patterns seen in nearly 20 disorders, using val- idated and standardized questionnaires as evaluative tools.Once an employee is determined to be positive for a pattern consistent with a specic disorder, the system delivers an ed- ucation/intervention program that provides multiple oppor-tunities for the person to hear a variety of available options for referral and treatment. This includes providing recom- mendations to the employees about obtaining professionalhelp or engaging in self-help based on the disorder theymay be suffering from and taking into account the level of symptom severity. TLC-Detect then educates and motivates the employees to engage in treatment and/or self-care. Fol-lowing this, the system will monitor the employees' mental health symptoms and treatment maintenance over time andwill motivate them to remain in treatment by calling them periodically to monitor their progress. Contacts between theemployees and TLC-Detect occur on a monthly basis afterthe assessment and subsequent intervention and referral have been offered. The major thrust of the conversation throughout the program is to encourage the employee to seek help. Oncethe employee has sought and received mental health care, it is the primary hypothesis of this study that the workplace productivity will be improved. The TLC-Detect system consists of the following compo- nents: (1) a Mental Health Assessment Module that screens for symptom patterns consistent with common mental healthdisorders that are likely to affect workplace productivity, (2)a Treatment Module that educates the user about an iden- tied mental health condition, offers referrals based on the severity of the mental health condition, and assesses the will-ingness of the employee who has a mental health condition to engage in treatment, and (3) a Follow-up Treatment Module that will monitor and promote the person's treatment main-tenance. The overall outline and flow of calls for the duration of the study are demonstrated in Fig. 1. The content of the screening and symptom assessment dia- logues was based on reliable and valid mental health screen-ing instruments. The content of the treatment and follow- up dialogues was based on the recommendations of two experienced mental health care clinicians. Below, we willdescribe a few additional components of the TLC-Detect System. Salutation Self-Help ReferralsPassword Intervention Exit EndProfessional Assistance ReferralsAssessment of Mental and Emotional Health Follow-up Treatment MaintenanceInformation, Advice & EducationInterventionFig. 1 Flow of the overall structure of TLC-detect'sconversation Springer52 J Med Syst (2007) 31:49-62 The TLC-Detect's frame all TLC applications TLC-Detect is comprised of struc- tural components that are designed to ensure that the system is user-friendly. These components consist of: 1) A greeting and salutation segment that initiates all conversations. Af-ter greeting, the user is asked to enter a password to ensure condentiality. 2) A TLC Trainer component that consists of instructions on how to use the system. These instructions arecarried out by TLC itself. TLC takes the user step-by-step through the process of using the system with examples of the types of questions that are asked during actual TLC conversa-tions, how to respond to questions, how to repeat a question,how to change a response, etc. 3) A TLC Helpline compo- nent which is an automated messaging center that provides assistance to subjects if questions arise in the use of the TLCsystem. Subjects can independently call the Helpline if they experience difculties using the TLC system or if they have questions about how to use it. The Helpline allows the userto leave a standard voicemail message that will be retrieved by the project staff. The TLC-Helpline is available to users 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Messages left on the Helplinewill be addressed within 24 hours or the next business day,during weekends and holidays. Upon receiving the message, a staff person will follow-up with the study participant to troubleshoot. If for any reason a study participant chooses touse the Helpline during a conversation with the TLC-Detect, s/he can also choose to hear the instructions in the TLC Trainer again. Furthermore, this function can also be used toend a current call and schedule another one to complete the conversation or leave a message for the study staff. 4) The TLC Call Scheduling: in most TLC applications, this par-ticular component determines follow-up call schedules forall users. However, for TLC-Detect this component controls additional functions which include scheduling calls for users who have more than one disorder and thus need to receivefurther education and information as well as those who need more than one referral to mental health care resources. This component also controls calls made to users who need to endtheir conversation with TLC-Detect prematurely. These indi- viduals usually receive a call from TLC-Detect the day after the conversation. If they are not available, TLC can leave amessage either on an answering machine or with the personwho answers the phone. In either case, strict condentiality is observed as the message will only contain a few words reminding the user to call TLC. 5) TLC-Free Speech com-ponent that is intended to perform the following functions: a) to reduce users' frustration due to the closed ended nature of the interaction, at the end of each conversation, users areasked whether they would like to leave a message for the research staff, b) users are asked to inform the study staff about potential difculties they encountered during systemutilization, and c) during the follow-up conversations usersare requested to leave a message to inform the study staff about any additional resources they might have utilized toseek treatment that were not offered by TLC-Detect. TLC Detect's screening functions An important function of TLC-Detect is to screen employ- ees for the presence of the following mental health disorders:somatization, major & minor (atypical) depression, suicidal ideation, acute bereavement, post-partum depression, dys- thymia, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, socialphobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder,bipolar disorder, alcohol and drug abuse and dependence, whether they have recently been a victim of violence and general stress such as nancial, marital, family and work-related problems. Subjects are also screened for the degree of functional impairment they experience and the amount of social support they receive as mitigating factors that couldinfluence the severity of their condition. TLC-Detect not only evaluates users for symptom sever- ity, it can also identify disorders at subsyndromal levels, i.e.,when symptoms do not meet full diagnostic criteria for aparticular disorder but may still be problematic. Cut-offs for symptom severity and subsyndromal levels are based on the recommendations made in the literature for each screeninginstrument. In cases where such recommendations were not available, we based these cutoffs on the recommendations of mental health care clinicians who advised us during thedesign phase as well as the diagnostic criteria described in the DSM-IV . The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) has been auto- mated to screen for 9 of the above disorders [ 28,29]. The PHQ is the self-administered version of the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD). PRIME-MD was developed as a screening instrument for mental dis-orders in a primary care setting. PRIME-MD is designed to be administered by a clinician while the PHQ is self- administered and thus more suitable for an IVR system.The PHQ screens for somatization, major and minor (atypi- cal) depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, eating and alcohol disorders, functional impairment, stress,and victimization due to violence as well as menstruationcomplications in women. To make the screening more ap- propriate for assessment of mental health among employees, we removed a number of modules from the PHQ and addedothers. For example, questions screening for alcohol disor- ders were replaced with several instruments that screened for risky alcohol use, alcohol abuse, and alcohol dependencesince this distinction is important for treatment. Moreover, we felt that some of these modules would be relevant only to a small minority of the individuals in the target population orwere already addressed by other questions in the PHQ (e.g., SpringerJ Med Syst (2007) 31:49-62 53 problems with menstruation and menstrual cramps). We also used other validated instruments to screen for important dis-orders that were not included in the PHQ (e.g., bipolar disor-der, social phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder). The PHQ has both binary (yes/no format) and interval scaled questions. We made no modications to the content or format of thePHQ questions. The PHQ has been evaluated for reliability and validity with acceptable results [ 28]. Unspecied emotional distress To enter the study, employees must screen positive for a cer- tain level of emotional and mental health stressors. However, some study participants while eligible for the study might end up screening negative for all disorders assessed by TLC-Detect due to any of the following reasons: 1) a person'sactual symptom patterns may not be consistent with any of the disorders included in the TLC-Detect's design, 2) the system may lack the sensitivity and specicity to accuratelyassess the presence of a particular condition, and 3) some individuals may not disclose their true feelings or experi- ence during the screening interview. As a result, assessmentof their mental and emotional health status may be inaccu- rate. We, therefore, included in the design an \"Unspecied Emotional Distress\" section to help those employees who re-sponded positively to eligibility questions that required thesubject to report the presence of some degree of stress in their lives. All employees who are directed to this section will re- ceive general information, education and referrals for stressmanagement and self-care strategies that would be helpful to them regardless of the specic disorder they might have. General architecture of the TLC-Detect's assessment module The rst session in this study consists of an extensive in- terview conducted by the research staff during which eligi- bility criteria are assessed and the outcome questionnairesare administered to the eligible participants. The interview process is totally automated and is carried out by a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) system. The CATI in-terviews help bypass time-consuming data coding, editing,and entry processes and thereby reducing interviewer error. It also allows for complex question branching and imme- diate scoring of study questionnaires that is accomplishedautomatically by the computer. Upon completion of base- line demographic questions, outcome data collection and randomization of participants into experimental and con-trol groups, all participants are connected to the TLC-Detect system by the interviewer. Assessment is carried out dur- ing this rst contact with TLC-Detect. The system beginsby welcoming users and subsequently offering training onhow to use the system. Subsequently, TLC-Detect leads the user through the rst level of assessment. The initial assess-ment consists of questions that all users receive. Based onthe users' response to these questions, further screening for each disorder may be conducted by immediately taking users through additional and more detailed (specic) questions. Since the rst call is relatively long, users will be offered the option to complete the call in more than one session. In this case, the next call should occur as soon as possible(within a week). Those who might be cut off from TLC- Detect (due to deliberate hang ups or technical problems) are also encouraged to call back to complete the call as soonas possible. Those users who fail to call back will receive acall from TLC-Detect within a day or two. The system uses the PHQ to screen for somatization [ 30] depression, panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.We designed the system so that it could screen for various forms of depression such as major and minor (atypical) de- pression, dysthymia, (a less severe, yet more chronic form ofdepression), postpartum depression and acute bereavement. [This strategy helps in directing users to the appropriate treatment recommendations and prevents the overlapping ofintervention and referral recommendations.] An important component of depression screening is as- sessment of suicidality. Based on a user's response to the suicidality question (the PHQ question #2i), three additionalquestions are asked to determine a risk level from low to urgent. Based on the risk level, TLC-Detect 'suggests,' 'rec- ommends' or 'urges' subjects to call a suicide hotline num-ber, their health care provider or if in need of immediate help, to go to the emergency room or call 911. For all but the highest risk level, TLC-Detect offers users the option toend the call so they can contact someone for help. For thehighest risk level, even though the call is ended and users are urged to seek help, the study's Principal Investigator and a staff psychiatrist are notied so that they may follow-upwith the user within 24 hours. Additional assessments include screening for social pho- bia (PHQ and Social Phobia Inventory) [ 31], post traumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder (PHQ, Impact of Events Scale [ 32-34], Acute Stress Disorder Scale) [ 35-37], as well as bipolar disorder (PRIME-MD and Mood DisorderQuestionnaire) [ 38-40]. The system then proceeds to screen users for alcohol and drug problems. TLC-Detect was designed to address three categories of alcohol and drug problems based on the DSM-IV criteria and the recommendations of experienced sub- stance abuse professionals [ 41,42]. The three categories for alcohol use problems are: 1) risky alcohol use (Sin-gle Alcohol Screening Question or SASQ and a Quantity- Frequency question), [ 42,43] 2) alcohol abuse (Short Index of Problems) [ 44], and 3) alcohol dependence (Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short Form) [ 45,46]. A Springer54 J Med Syst (2007) 31:49-62 positive response to risky alcohol use will automatically re- fer users to sub-modules that ask questions assessing alco-hol abuse and dependence. Similarly, for drug problems, thethree categories are: 1) drug use (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment TIP-24). A negative response to this question trig- gers two additional questions that address prescription drugabuse. A positive response to any of these questions will trigger questions for the following two categories of drug abuse and dependence, 2) drug abuse (DSM-IV for sub-stance abuse), and 3) drug dependence (Section H of the CIDI-SF). It is important to note that users will receive an intervention for only one of these three categories (of sub-stance abuse, alcohol or drugs) even if a user screens positivefor more than one category. The intervention provided will target the most severe category into which a subject falls. This means that users who screen positive for dependenceare not screened for abuse and all users that are positive for abuse or dependence would have also been positive for the initial screening questions. Therefore, if a user screenspositive for risky alcohol use and alcohol dependence, s/he will receive the intervention for alcohol dependence and if a user screens positive for drug use and drug abuse, s/hewill receive the drug abuse intervention. In both alcohol anddrug dependence, TLC-Detect asks an additional question that determines the degree of functional impairment caused by such dependence (on a scale from 0 to 4, with a score of 4being the most severe). TLC-Detect also assesses the degree of functional impairment due to substance abuse on a scale from 0 to 4. Based on the users' answers to these questions,users that score higher than a 2 on either the functional im- pairment scale or admit they use more than one type of drug are moved up to the next severity level for that disorder. Thereason for weighing the severity level is the understandingthat those who admit they have difculties with their family, work and social relationships and those who use more than one type of drug tend to have a more severe drug problem[47,48]. To determine whether the user has ever been a victim of violence, TLC-Detect asks question #13 of the PHQ [haveyou been hit, slapped, kicked or otherwise physically hurt by someone or has anyone forced you to have an unwanted sexual act?]. Users will be allowed to skip this question ifthey are unwilling to respond to it. TLC-Detect will keeptrack of how many users do in fact skip this question. Functional impairment, social support, stress: Treatment intensity adjuster (TIA) score In order to provide appropriate intervention to users it is im- portant to determine the degree to which a particular disorder has had a harmful impact on users' family, work and sociallife. The system designers felt that availability of social sup-port and experiencing daily stressors are signicant factors contributing to an individual's ability to cope. As a result,a Treatment Intensity Adjuster (TIA) was created that takesinto consideration functional impairment, social support and presence of stress. Functional impairment is determined by the PHQ's question #11 [ 49]. An initial screening to assess stress is carried out by using the Perceived Stress Scale-4 [28,50]. We wrote three questions ourselves to determine availability of social support to users. Inadequate social sup-port was identied by whether users have someone to turn to for help, someone to conde in and how often users felt lonely. The scores from the above factors are added to create the TIA score. Based on the TIA, if a user's response to the \"stress,\" \"social support\" and \"functional impairment\" ques- tions is cumulatively greater than 9, then the severity level ofthe disorder for that particular user would be moved up one level [ 51]. For example, if a person's score for depression is mild, however, that person's cumulative TIA score is greaterthan 9, then that person's depression severity level is moved up to \"severe.\" In this manner, TLC-Detect identies a per- son's inability to cope with their emotional distress factorsand will address this appropriately. General architecture of TLC-Detect's treatment/intervention module The TLC-Detect's Treatment/Intervention Module is de- signed to be seamlessly presented to employees immediately after they have been screened for mental health disorders by the system. The objective of this module is to motivate theemployee to enter into and sustain an effective treatmentsituation for their mental health condition(s). [Specic inter- vention options tailored to particular disorders are offered to users immediately after they complete the screening.] TheModule presents the following topics: 1) a description of the user's specic condition, 2) availability of effective treatment to help the employee deal with the distress they are feeling,3) an assessment of the employee's willingness to engage in mental health care, and 4) referrals for self-help and/or professional assistance. Co-morbid disorders When co-morbid mental disorders, i.e., presence of more than one co-occurring disorder, are identied by TLC-Detect, users will be provided with the intervention for all of theiridentied disorders. This creates a challenge to the system: to assign priorities for treatment and self-care recommenda- tions for a variety of co-occurring disorders. Since receiv-ing an intervention for more than one disorder would be SpringerJ Med Syst (2007) 31:49-62 55 Table 1.

These \"co-morbid\" employees are encouraged to speak with TLC-Detect once a week until they have been exposed to all of the prioritized and queued intervention content. If these em- ployees happen to have more disorders than the number ofweeks in a month, the system divides the calls evenly de- pending on the number of the disorders. These calls will be considered, \"Continued Intervention\" Calls and not \"follow-up\" calls. In order to give users options and to complete theintervention as soon as possible, during the (rst) interven- tion call and throughout these \"continued intervention\" calls, users are asked if they would like to receive interventions foradditional disorders during the same call, allowing them to determine the pace and intensity of the intervention. It is, thus, possible for a person who suffers from co-morbid dis-orders to complete assessment and the intervention for all of his/her disorders in one telephone call, contingent upon their motivation, persistence and time availability. The intervention module The intervention module consists of two sub-modules: ed- ucation and referral. All users who screen positive for one or more disorders will receive education for each disorderidentied, regardless of severity. The education component always begins with a description of the disorder, its common symptoms and usual treatment methods as well as a few tipsand practical advice on self- help approaches. Referrals fallinto two different categories: self-management and profes- sional assistance . Within each category, there are several components that refer users to the appropriate resources forself-help as well as professional assistance. For example, self-management may include advice and information on the benets of regular exercise and healthy diet, instruction andeducation for meditation, information about where to obtainself-help workbooks, and information on how to access sup- port groups, when available. Professional assistance implies the involvement of a mental health professional in the in-tervention and may include recommendations on receiving assistance from a health care provider to manage stress, in- formation on group therapy, and other information relatedto Employee Assistance Programs and behavioral health evaluation. The education and information that are provided as part of the intervention will be rank ordered based on the signif- icance and severity of the disorder. To operationalize rank- ordering of the disorder severity, we created a Matrix (seeTable 1). Based on the Matrix in Table 1, to users with more than one disorder, TLC-Detect will recommend for which dis- order they should listen to an intervention rst. The rec-ommendation is based on the group rank a given disorder is assigned into (inter-group ranking). The intervention for a disorder that belongs to the group ranked #1 is recommendedbefore a disorder that falls into the group ranked #3. In ad- dition, if a user has more than one disorder in one group, TLC-Detect's recommendation will be based on the severitylevel of the disorders within that group (intra-group ranking).For example, if a person has mild bipolar disorder together with severe panic disorder (both in group #2), the person will be provided information and counseling about panic disor-der rst. If both disorders happen to have the same severity level, then TLC-Detect will choose a disorder based on its intragroup rank. The intragroup rank is determined by thedisorder's position on the group list. The highest rank (most severe disorder within the group) is at the top of the group list and the lowest rank (least severe disorder within thegroup) is the last on the list. For example, if a participanthas severe bipolar disorder and severe post-traumatic stress disorder, s/he will hear about bipolar disorder rst because it is placed above PTSD on the list. (Disorders with sub-syndromal severity are presented last regardless of [inter or intra] group assignment.)

In thisTable, disorders and severity levels are identied in two sep- arate columns. The table includes a legend based on which TLC-Detect's recommendations to users are graded from\"suggestion\" to \"critical.\" For example, to a person who has screened positive for moderate dysthymia, TLC-Detect \"strongly recommends\" contacting their Employee Assis-tant Program or seeking consultation with a mental health professional while also \"recommending\" exercise and self- help work books and \"suggesting\" a healthy dietary regimen.Or, to a person who is screened positive for severe bipolardisorder, TLC-Detect \"recommends\" a self-help workbook, and also states that it is \"critical\" for that person to seek evaluation by a mental health care professional or to consultwith the Employee Assistance Program.The numbers in the Table thus denote the specic type of recommendation TLC- Detect provides to users during a given conversation. Fur-thermore, referrals signied by numbers 1 and 2 are always offered during the rst intervention call while those denoted by numbers 3, 4 and 5 are presented during the follow upcalls. The follow-up and maintenance periods After the initial assessment and intervention are completed, subjects will be followed for a period that may take ap-proximately twelve months. This period is divided into two phases: follow-up and maintenance. During the follow-up period, TLC-Detect will make monthly calls to participants:1) to inquire whether they have adhered to the recommendedreferral advice and maintained treatment, 2) to offer the in- tervention module again if a participant has not adhered to the advice, 3) to explore whether participants have experi-enced symptom improvement or worsening, or no change, and nally, 4) to provide additional referrals and/or informa- tion not provided before. Maintenance calls are shortenedversions of the follow-up calls and occur every two months. As in the follow-up calls, during maintenance conversations TLC-Detect also assesses users' symptom severity (better,same, worse). Based on the design of the follow-up and maintenance modules, users with certain disorders will be followed up more closely than others. In these cases, TLC-Detect asks ad-ditional questions specic to the disorder in order to provide targeted intervention if necessary. Here are three examples: 1) patients with substance abuse problems require regular andthorough follow-up evaluations [ 52]. During their follow-up calls, the system is designed to explore possible barriers to quitting and to offer solutions to address each barrier. 2)Similarly, because mood instability is a common character-istic of individuals with bipolar disorder, they will have their manic symptoms re-assessed during monthly TLC-Detectfollow-up calls. This will ensure that an emerging manic ordepressive mood swing that occurs during the follow-up pe- riod will be detected and to alert the patient and the system's psychiatrist that a manic episode may be occurring. 3) Thoseindividuals who have reported to TLC-Detect that they have experienced a single panic attack will be followed-up with regular calls to make sure that they have not experiencedadditional attacks. These individuals will be placed in the \"panic disorder\" category and will be provided with the ap- propriate intervention. 4) For users who disclose that theyhave been victims of violence, the system and the study'smental health staff will address the risk of the subject re- maining in a dangerous environment. The follow-up module components An important component of the follow-up module is TLC- Detect's efforts to obtain external clinical corroboration of the nature of the user's probable mental disorder. TLC-Detectwill ask whether the user has sought help from a mentalhealth care professional to learn if the mental health profes- sional agreed with the system's assessment of the disorder. If a user indicates that s/he has consulted with a mental healthcare professional and that the diagnosis made by that clini- cian does not concur with TLC-Detect's assessment, then the system will do one of two things: 1) In those instances wherethe disorder diagnosed by a user's mental health clinician is among those including in the TLC-Detect's disorder reper- toire, then the system will call the user during the followingweek to offer options to provide the corresponding interven-tion module. As described earlier, TLC-Detect will spread out the follow-up calls throughout the month if users are diagnosed with more than one disorder to reduce the burdenof long or complex calls. 2) If, however, lack of concordance between TLC-Detect and the patient's clinician suggests the diagnostic inferences made by the system are incorrect, orif TLC-Detect is not designed to provide information on the clinician-assessed diagnosis, then those users will receive the intervention provided for the \"Unspecied EmotionalDistress\" described earlier. A second important component of the Follow-up Mod- ule is an assessment of the patients' motivation to change their behavior. This is accomplished through a determina-tion of the users' stage of readiness to seek help. This assess- ment is informed by the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change [ 53] in which a person's readiness to engage in a positive health behavior is categorized into one of ve stages (Precontemplation, Contemplation, Preparation, Action and Maintenance). Springer60 J Med Syst (2007) 31:49-62 Readiness for treatment component The \"Readiness for Treatment\" component is comprised of a number of questions that are asked once the interven- tion module has been offered and is intended to determine whether users are ready to seek treatment. Users will beasked whether they anticipate \"getting into treatment\" for the identied problem(s) and if so when. If they answer negatively or report they have no plans to seek treatmentwithin the next 2 months, they will be assigned to the Pre- contemplation stage. Those who answer that they are plan- ning to get help within a month will be categorized as inPreparation; otherwise users will be assigned to the Con-templation stage. Because of the enrollment criteria, none of the users will be in the Action or Maintenance stages. During each follow-up call, TLC-Detect will re-administerthe \"engaging in treatment\" staging questions and then will provide a stage-appropriate response. All participants who progress to the action and maintenance stages of behav-ioral change will be offered the materials in the maintenance module. The rst set of follow-up calls will assess whether the user has followed TLC-Detect's recommendations. Subse-quently, the system will provide encouragement, support and reinforcement to those who report that they have sought care and are remaining in treatment. For those who have notsought care or have reported that they do not plan to get help within the next two months, a list of common potential barriers to seeking and remaining in treatment will be ex-plored (e.g., transportation problems, residing too far from the source of care, family problems or other emergencies, be- ing too busy, forgetting, therapeutic pessimism, previous his-tory of a bad experience with a mental health care provider,too depressed to take action, etc.). TLC-Detect will then provide advice and solutions corresponding to each barrier reported. During follow-up TLC-Detect conversations, those users who have not adhered to referral recommendations will hear the referral information provided again, along with additionaleducation to promote adherence. All users may also hear new referrals and information never heard before, added to the system during regular updates of referral resources. All userswill be provided with book titles they can read about theirdisorder(s). Users not adhering to at least one referral recom- mendation will be delivered the \"Barriers\" and \"Readiness to Change\" educational components during a TLC-Detectfollow-up call. This procedure will continue throughout the rst six months of system utilization. The last six months of the project will be devoted to the \"Maintenance\" calls targeting those who have sought help. In contrast, those who never seek help will continue to remain in the Follow-up ModuleThe maintenance module The Maintenance Module is designed to determine whether the user is still engaged in treatment. When users re- spond that they are no longer in treatment, TLC-Detect will assess the reason for treatment discontinuation. During theenquiry, four response options are offered: 1) difculty car- rying out the recommendations, 2) symptom improvement, 3) lack of interest in the recommendation, and 4) none of theabove. Those who respond \"none of the above,\" will be di- rected to a free speech component where they can record an open-ended message and describe the problem. It should beadded that all participants will be invited to leave a messagein this free speech section. During Maintenance calls, all users will be offered an opportunity to listen again to the information and referralsfrom the Intervention Module corresponding to their specic disorder. In the very last interaction, TLC-Detect will inquire whether users have experienced any new symptoms that thesystem has not yet explored or whether users have been newly diagnosed with a disorder not yet detected by the system. This feature will inform the system designers aboutdisorders that may be prevalent but were not included in theinitial design of TLC-Detect. Intervals between TLC-detect contacts The rst TLC-Detect follow-up call will occur one month after the initial (screening and intervention) contact call. Thereafter, the employee will receive calls every month for six months, and every other month thereafter (during the nalsix months of use). Participants will receive brief remindercalls in the middle of each month to reinforce the informa- tion they have received during the last TLC conversation. The mid-month calls will be optional and users will have theoption not to listen to the information provided. Conclusion Undiagnosed or under-treated mental health disorders have negative impact on workers' productivity. Mental healthscreening of workers is challenging due to the stigma at- tached to mental disorders. Many employers who recognize the signicant impact of mental health disorders on produc-tivity have made attempts to assist workers by deploying Employee Assistance Programs and other approaches de- signed to address a wide-range of employees' mental andemotional health problems. Most of the time, however, em- ployees are reluctant to use these programs for fear of loss of condentiality, stigma and most importantly, fear if loss ofemployment. As the number of individuals with undiagnosed SpringerJ Med Syst (2007) 31:49-62 61 mental disorders is substantial, early detection and interven- tion is likely to help reduce subsequent complications forboth patients, employers and society. Automated systemsmay provide the functionality that facilitates mental health screening and intervention in the workplace where employ- ees may be otherwise hesitant to seek or receive help. Thedevelopment and evaluation of an assessment and treatment referral tool, TLC-Detect, is important because the system addresses a major public health problem; under detection andunder-treatment of mental health disorder in the population. Investigators have explored the possibility that people may be more willing to divulge to a computer personaland intimate details of their lives, with less fear of nega-tive consequences [ 21]. In fact, research in human-computer interaction has shown that some individuals may be more truthful during disclosure of potentially embarrassing or pri-vate personal information to a computer in comparison to disclosures to a human interviewer [ 54-56]. Evidence that computer-administered interviews encourage self-disclosurehas led to the development of important applications, such as computer-based interviews to detect risky health behaviors [16,56-60]. An automated system such as TLC-Detect that assesses employees using the telephone and provides educa-tion, treatment referrals and self-care advice is an efcient, low cost and condential tool that can improve mental and emotional distress among employees. Ultimately, successfulautomated behavioral telehealth systems offer the promise of enhanced productivity in the workplace.

Methods: Weekly in-depth interviews were conducted with 15 patients who used the computer telephony system for 4 weeks. Users had a diagnosis of unipolar depression and took at least one antidepressant. All interviews were audio-taped and immediately transcribed. The tran- scripts of the interviews were subsequently coded and analyzed thematically by two qualitativeresearchers.Results: The patients spoke about the automated system as if it was a social actor. They did not, however, have an illusion that there was a health professional communicating through thesystem. Instead, they felt that it was designed to appear human-like. The majority oered sug- gestions intended to make the system behave and sound more like a ''human professional'' and lesslike a ''machine''. They believed that the system would be more usable, acceptable and eective if these changes were made. 0747-5632/$ - see front matter /C2112004 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction During the past few decades computer-based automated systems have been inte- grated in many facets of peoples /C213lives. In health care, computer-based systems designed to provide health information and advice to patients and consumers areon the rise ( Slack, 1997 ). Some of these systems appear similar to a human health professional: interactive and designed to emulate the style of a human counselor (Friedman, 1998 ). They ask questions, provide tailored and appropriate responses to users, oer practical advice and educate by providing useful and up-to-date healthinformation. Some computer-based systems are deliberately designed to display hu-man qualities, such as empathy, humor and objectivity ( Friedman, Stollerman, Ma- honey, & Rozenblyum, 1997 ). The goal is to have users respond as they would to a human health professional. Studies of users of automated systems, in health and other spheres of human life note that many users actually respond to them in anthropomorphic terms: ( Fried- man, 1995; Kahn, Friedman, & Hagman, 2002 ) users assign human characteristics such as emotions, feelings and other qualities to the inanimate computer system(Fogg & Nass, 2000; Koda & Maes, 1995). The present paper presents the results of a formative evaluation, conducted to explore the attitudes of users of a computer-based telephony system designed tofunction and appear like a human health professional who cares for patients withdepression (TLC-Depression). We sought to evaluate whether, patient users estab-lished anthropomorphic relationships with the system, and, if so, the meanings of these relationships to them. 2. Methods 2.1. The study setting The TLC-Depression is designed to be used by ambulatory patients with unipolar depression. It includes modules for monitoring the patients /C213disease severity and for promoting anti-depressant medication-taking and visit adherence. The study wasconducted in our headquarters (Medical Information Systems Unit) at Boston Med-ical Center (BMC). Many of the participants received their mental health care at theBMC /C213s Psychiatry Clinic.1168 R. Farzanfar et al. / Computers in Human Behavior 23 (2007) 1167-11822.2. A description of the automated health system 2.2.1. The basic system: telephone-linked communications The automated telephony system we evaluated, used a computer-based telecom- munications system technology that has been developed to monitor patients with chronic diseases, help them care for themselves ( Friedman et al., 1997; Friedman et al., 1996; Friedman et al., 1998 ) and assist patients and consumers make impor- tant changes in health behavior ( Friedman, 1998; 1997; Delichatsios called T elephone-L inked C ommunications (TLC) can be used as a stand- alone service by patients/consumers or it can supplement the care provided byclinicians. During automated telephone conversations, TLC asks users questionsto monitor the targeted disease(s) and health behaviors, provides information, edu- cation, advice and behavioral counseling to modify or sustain behavior, and re- ports important ndings to responsible caregivers. Patients communicate byeither pressing the keys on the telephone keypad or by speaking directly into thetelephone receiver. Either the patient or the system can initiate a conversation. Should the patient fail to call when expected, TLC will call the patient. Upon telephoning, TLC isdescribed. Thereafter, patients are asked to phone in regularly (weekly in mostTLC applications). At the beginning of a TLC conversation, the patient is asked to enter a password to ensure security. The system then begins the conversation with a salutation, follows with questions and provides responses to the patient /C213s answers. In addition to questioning, TLC provides education and behavioral rein-forcement, such as counseling on how to take medications at prescribed times.TLC conversations were designed to emulate telephone conversations between pa-tients and health professionals, drawing on specic behavioral theories. A typicalconversation lasts between 10 and 15 min, depending on the number and com-plexity of the topics addressed and the user /C213s responses. After each conversation, TLC stores in a database information the user has communicated. TLC relays important information obtained from the conversations to the patient /C213s health care provider via electronic transmission or fax. Reports of an emergency natureare sent immediately. 2.3. The T elephone L inked C ommunications for Depression Telephone Linked Communications for Depression (TLC-Depression) is a mul- ti-contact system designed for weekly use over an extended period of time. The system was programmed to use SpeechWorks, /C228which uses a continuous speech (''speaker-independent'') voice recognition system which interprets what a personsays. The system does not require an individual user to ''train'' it in order tobe understood. TLC-Depression is comprised of two modules: (1) Disease moni-toring and (2) Self-care. Dierent modules of the TLC-Depression scripts were re-corded by a male voice professional. In the following sections, we describe thesemodules.R. Farzanfar et al. / Computers in Human Behavior 23 (2007) 1167-1182 11692.3.1. The TLC-Depression disease monitoring module The objective of the TLC-Depression monitoring module is to provide between oce visits timely clinical information to mental health care providers regardingthe status of their patients. The information collected is designed to aid the providerin disease management and is obtained by TLC-Depression during regular (weekly) assessment of symptom severity. The content of the module is based on a standard- ized depression screening questionnaire: the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)which is part of the PRIME-MD (Prim ary Care E valuation of M ental D isorders) (Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001 ). The PHQ-9 contains nine symptom questions and provides a quick and simple method to diagnose depression, track depression severity, and monitor a patient /C213s response to therapy. Each TLC-Depression call asks all PHQ-9 questions. One re-sult of the assessment is the determination of suicidality and, if it is present, whether there is suicidal ideation (thoughts only), suicidal planning (thought about how to accomplish it) and/or suicidal intent (intention to carry out a plan). Basedon what the patient reports, the TLC-Depression disease monitoring module gen-erates one of three types of reports to the responsible mental health care provider:Important (reporting suicidal ideation), Urgent (reporting suicidal planning) andEmergent (reporting suicidal intent). Important and urgent alerts are sent immedi-ately to the provider /C213s sta who receive these alerts and place them in the mailbox (physical or electronic) of the responsible clinician. Emergency alerts are not only sent immediately, but TLC-Depression automatically and immediately pages the Director of the Psychiatric Emergency Department and telephones her private lineto leave a message on voice mail. All of the alerts contain the name, address andtelephone number of the patient, the nature of the alert (suicidal ideation, planningor intent), and the clinician module The TLC self-care module is comprised of dierent segments that assess and pro- mote: (A) anti-depressant medication-taking; (B) oce visit attendance; (C) three addi- tional aspects of self-care: regular exercise, sleep hygiene, and responsible alcohol use. 2.3.2.1. Anti-depressant medication taking. The purpose of this self-care manage- ment component is to monitor the patients /C213use of prescribed anti-depressants and promote complete adherence to the regimen. The system collects medication datafrom automated monitors on the antidepressant medication bottles on a monthly ba-sis while patients communicate self-reported adherence weekly. The main objective of collecting both self-report and MEMS data was to enhance the rigor of the data. Collecting only self-reported adherence data is considered ''systematically'' unsoundbecause adherence is not objectively measured and the data may not be accurate(Haynes, Taylor, & Sackett, 1979 ). We use special bottle caps (Medication Event Monitoring Systems [MEMS /C228], Aardex Corp.) to detect ''dose events'' and from these, calculate medicationregimen adherence. Previous work has shown that assessment of adherence by1170 R. Farzanfar et al. / Computers in Human Behavior 23 (2007) 1167-1182MEMS caps is both reliable and valid; the method is the gold standard for deter- mining patient medication-taking adherence ( Thompson, two parts: a standard plastic vial with threaded opening and a cap for the vial that contains a micro-electronic circuit that registers times when the bottle is opened or closed. Each closing of the cap constitutes a dose event. Medication dose events stored in the MEMScaps are transferred to a secure Web server through a MEMS communicator.The communicator is a device that reads and writes the user /C213s medication adher- ence data over a ''serial'' cable connected to a computer /C213s serial port. Each time a MEMS cap is ''read'' or ''written'' on, it is placed on the communicator and thedata on the cap are transferred. Special software at the Web server analyzes theMEMS data, calculates medication-taking parameters (total percentage of doses taken during a time period, pattern of medication-taking [e.g., some patients may fail to take medication on weekends] and variability of medication-takingtime [e.g., some patients may take medication erratically instead of at regularintervals) ,and stores them in a database at the Web site where they are electron- ically ''retrieved'' by the TLC system. Retrieval of data was made possiblethrough the development of software that functions as a bridge that queries intothe MEMS data repository. The computed results of the queries are then for-warded to the TLC data repository. Data transfer occurs within minutes of its download from the MEMS communicator. 2.3.2.1.1. The automated conversation. The conversation in the medication adherence module contains the following topics: (1) medication regimen knowledge;(2) medication-taking self-report; of barriers; (7) myths andmisconceptions about anti-depressants. (1) The medication regimen knowledge segment begins by TLC-Depression ask- ing the patient to collect his/her antidepressant bottle(s). Next, the system ascertains whether the patient is taking his/her prescribed anti-depressantreferring both to generic and common trade name(s). If the correct medica-tion is conrmed, TLC-Depression determines whether the patient /C213s under- standing of the unit dose is the same as that prescribed. This question isfollowed by one that asks about the number of units (tablets, capsules,etc.) the patient takes at one-time (per dose) and the number of times thisdosing is repeated daily. In instances when there is a discrepancy between what TLC-Depression has recorded as the prescription and the patient /C213s report, the patient /C213s current prescription is reviewed with the patient, his/ her pharmacy and/or physician /C213s oce. The objective is to determine whether the discrepancy is due to the patient /C213s lack of understanding of the regimen or to a physician-prescribed change in the regimen that wasnot communicated to TLC-Depression. Subsequently, discrepancies are cor-rected and the patient is notied about any misunderstandings he/she mighthave.R. Farzanfar et al. / Computers in Human Behavior 23 (2007) 1167-1182 1171(2) Medication-taking self-report: TLC-Depression asks patients to get their TLC medication calendar. The calendar is given to the patients during theirbaseline visit to record the doses of their anti-depressants taken daily, facili-tating reporting of them to TLC for the previous week (last seven days).TLC-Depression then asks about prescription rells, pocketed doses (all pills that have been taken out of the bottle and are either pocketed or left in a pill tray, etc.) and missed doses, if any. Once the medication-taking regimen hasbeen established, the system compares the proportion of prescribed dosestaken (medication adherence) for the previous week with the adherence per-centage calculated during previous calls for previous weekly time periods.Based on the comparison, TLC-Depression gives the patient feedback onwhether his/her level of adherence has changed and, if so whether it is betteror worse and by what degree. (3) MEMS data and feedback: TLC-Depression uses MEMS caps adherence data downloaded on a monthly basis to give feedback to patients regardingadherence level (proportion of prescribed doses taken), drug holidays andvariability in the time of day in medication-taking. Data on medication-taking patterns and time variability are only collected by MEMS capsand not through self report. In the beginning of this section, however,TLC-Depression communicates that the MEMS caps are not perfect andsometimes may not be accurate. For example, it begins by saying ''the bot- tle cap will give most people an accurate report of when they have taken or missed their medication. In some cases, however, it can be less accurate.You told me that you sometimes take pills out of your bottle to take themlater (pocketing doses). So, the information gathered by the bottle cap maynot be the whole picture of when you take your medication, but it shouldbe pretty close.'' (4) Assessment of the patients /C213motivation to take his/her anti-depressant: First, TLC-Depression asks them to rate the importance of taking the medication from 0 to 10. Next, it responds to the patient /C213s entry and follows with compar- ison to the rating during the previous week. During the rst 3 weeks of conver-sations, all highly motivated patients (ratings of 8-10) skip the rest of theconversation scripted for the section and will proceed to the next. For patientswho rate their motivation for taking the medication below eight, TLC-Depres-sion presents a list of common reasons (three at a time) why people sometimesdo not want to take their anti-depressants and asks them to choose those thatare relevant. (5) Assessment of patient /C213s condence that she/he can follow his/her prescription: The conversations in this section use techniques from Self-Ecacy Theory(Bandura, 1977 ) and motivational interviewing to boost patients /C213condence (Miller & Rollnick, 2002 ). TLC-Depression assesses the patients /C213condence levels by asking them to rate their condence in following their anti-depressantprescription regimen. If a patient /C213s response reveals low condence, TLC will say: ''Does your clinician know that you think you cannot successfully followyour prescription? Be sure to bring this up during your next appointment, or1172 R. Farzanfar et al. / Computers in Human Behavior 23 (2007) 1167-1182phone him or her to talk about it. In your TLC calendar notes write your thoughts about your lack of condence. Share them with your clinician. It willhelp your clinician nd ways to make it easier for you.'' (6) Identication of barriers to taking anti-depressants as prescribed: TLC- Depression identies the barriers a patient might face that prevent full adher- ence to his/her antidepressant regimen. In this section patients are presented with a list of three topics at a time to choose from. Topics include is on practical approaches to solving medication-tak-ing diculties and presenting an array of strategies for various situations. Forexample: ''People most often explain why they do not take their medication bysaying something like, /C212I do not know; I just forget to take it /C213. Specically, peo- ple are most likely to forget or put o taking pills when they are very busy or under a lot of stress. Say /C212forget /C213if you would like to hear about ways to pre- vent yourself from forgetting your medication. For handling busy times thatinterfere with medication, say /C212busy /C213. For information on dealing with stressful times, say /C212stress /C213. If none of them interest you today, say /C212None'' /C213. (7) Examining myths and misconceptions about antidepressants: This section deals with 12 common misconceptions, misunderstandings and mistakenbeliefs that patients may have about their anti-depressant or about depressionin general. Every two weeks TLC-Depression presents the patients with two myths and ascertains whether they believe in either. The list includes statements such as ''it is OK to stop taking antidepressant while you are sick with flu orcold,'' or ''depression is just a normal part of the aging process.'' 2.3.2.2. Oce visit adherence promotion. This section is comprised of two parts: (1) assessment of psychiatry clinic attendance and counseling to improve attendance, ifrequired; (2) education to encourage patients to get the most benet out of their visits.Assessment is conducted by asking questions about the reasons for missed visits fol- lowed by advice on how to remedy the problem. Information and advice include such instructions as writing down thoughts or questions before a visit, not saving the big-gest concerns for the end of the visit, etc. 2.3.2.3. Additional aspects of self-care. This section was designed to provide patients with information and education on three critical areas of self-help fordepression: (1) promoting physical activity for those patients whose amount of phys-ical activity may not be sucient based on standards set by Centers for Disease Con- trol and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of Sport Medicine (ACSM); (2) sleep hygiene to help patients whose sleep has been aected by depression; (3)detection of alcohol abuse. The physical activity promotion component informs and educates patients on the benets of getting regular exercise by oering support and encouragementfor patients to begin an exercise program, or increase the amount of physicalactivity they engage in. The second area concerns sleep. TLC-Depression asksquestions to determine to what extent the patient /C213s depression has aected sleep.R. Farzanfar et al. / Computers in Human Behavior 23 (2007) 1167-1182 1173The system then, provides advice and information to the patients for the avoidance of situations that may contribute to sleeplessness. The alcohol segment contains anautomated version of the AUDIT (A lcohol U se Disorder I dentication Test) which is a standardized, valid and reliable instrument for screening drinking behavior ( Ba- bor, de la Fuente, Saunders, & Grant, 1992 ). The TLC-Depression system activates the AUDIT questions if a patient chooses to learn whether s/he has a drinking prob- lem. For those who score high for problem drinking, TLC-Depression providesadvice and oers the telephone number for the Massachusetts alcohol hotline whichis a 24-hour hotline oering around the clock access to counseling, emergency sup-port, and information and referral services. TLC-Depression also urges the patientto talk to his/her doctor or a health professional regarding his/her alcoholconsumption. 2.4. Design of the formative evaluation study 2.4.1. The target population Our principal objective was to understand the experience of users of TLC-Depres- sion and identify deciencies in design that could be corrected. We conducted thequalitative evaluation over two months with 15 patients (9 women, 6 men; 2 Hispan-ics, 5 Blacks and 8 Whites; the age range was 20-60) diagnosed with depression andon one or more antidepressants. Recruitment was carried out by posting fliers at Boston Medical Center /C213s (BMC) Psychiatry Clinic and other hospital clinics and advertising in a Boston daily newspaper. The fliers and advertisement addressed pa-tients diagnosed with depression and invited them to use and evaluate an automatedtelephone system ''designed to help patients with unipolar depression with adherenceto their antidepressant medication regimen.'' We informed potential participantsthat they would receive a $100 stipend for participation. We listed a telephone con-tact number for interested individuals to call and leave a message. One hundred and thirty individuals left messages. Subsequently, we called poten- tial participants to explain the study, assess eligibility, and obtain verbal informed consent for those who were eligible. Eligibility criteria were: (1) P18 years old; (2) diagnosis of unipolar depression; (3) taking at least one antidepressant; (4) fluencyin spoken English. All those who were eligible and gave verbal informed consentwere invited for an initial study visit at our research headquarters on a rst-called,rst-selected basis. All participants signed an informed consent document and a HI-PAA authorization form during their study visit. The visit took place within a weekof the telephone interview. Participants were given a system password, shown how to use TLC-Depression, and provided with a user /C213s guide that contained important information on how to use the system, answers to ''frequently asked questions,'' and a ''calendar'' to enterthe time of day when took medication and the date and times of their PsychiatryClinic appointments. Following the initial visit, subjects had 3 weekly study visitsfor in-depth interviews about their experiences using TLC-Depression, likes and dis-likes, and suggestions about the system and how it could be improved. They hadcomplete freedom to express opinions. Interviews lasted between 30 and 60 minutes1174 R. Farzanfar et al. / Computers in Human Behavior 23 (2007) 1167-1182All interviews were audio-taped and immediately transcribed. Thematic analysis of the transcripts began immediately after each interview. Since the qualitative study preceded a randomized clinical trial that evaluated the impact of TLC-Depression, we pre-tested a clinical trial protocol and instrumentsduring the qualitative study. During the initial visit the participants lled out draft study questionnaires and were given MEMS caps to place on their anti-depressant bottles to monitor/track medication-taking behavior. All participants were in-structed to call TLC-Depression four times/week for one month (16 calls in total)in order to attain more contact times over a short study period than would have beenthe case with the weekly calls planned for the clinical trial. Since we conducted in-depth interviews over time (a total of three interviews over 3 weeks), we were also able to track, delineate and clarify experiences over time. Therst and second authors analyzed and coded the interview transcripts independently in thematic categories. Discrepancies in coding were identied, discussed and resolved. 3. Results In evaluating TLC-Depression, the participants drew heavily from their experi- ences with depression, ambivalence about taking antidepressants and, simulta- neously, awareness of the fact that adherence to a medication regimen was an important aspect of recovery. They shared with us their personal stories of suering,struggle and triumph over depression. They identied important issues in the designof TLC-Depression. A number of themes and general issues emerged from analysisof the interviews. 3.1. Humanizing the machine 3.1.1. Sounding more natural We learned that the system was evoking emotional and behavioral responses from our participants that typically are expressed in interaction with health professionals.For example, their responses to TLC-Depression feedback about medication-takingsuggested that feelings and behaviors were aected by a desire to be seen as a ''goodpatient.'' Despite knowledge that assessment of medication-taking habits was beingcarried out by a machine, most felt an obligation to improve medication takingbehavior. In the words of one female participant: ''When he[emphasis added] is disappointed because you are doing bad you feel sad.'' Another woman, was critical of the system because of its long and tedious informational/educational sections, butalso said: ''It was probably the rst time in my life that I got my rell before I neededit. I am one of those people that runs out every month and won /C213t have pills for three days. I have been on it for years, and I still do it. But, the rst or second time I called,that [reminder for the patient to rell their antidepressant prescription on time] wasone of the options. It is not like he told me anything I didn /C213t know. But,I guess once you /C213ve heard his little speech ,you don /C213t want to disappoint him [emphasis added].''R. Farzanfar et al. / Computers in Human Behavior 23 (2007) 1167-1182 1175The majority of participants referred to the TLC-Depression system as '' he. '' [As described earlier, a male professional recorded the TLC-Depression script.] One indi-vidual referred to the system as ''it'' during his rst qualitative evaluation interviewsession [after using the system one or two times], but then referred to the system as''he'' consistently thereafter during subsequent interviews. At one point during the third interview he referred to the system as ''the voice of my old friend,'' while on another occasion he called it, ''the machine-man!'' One participant said that shethought the /C212voice /C213should have a name. When we asked what the name should be, she said: ''Dr. X!'' A number of participants wanted us to make TLC-Depression sound more ''hu- man-like.'' This opinion, however, was expressed in two dierent ways. Some partic-ipants wanted TLC-Depression to sound less ''robotic,'' ''articial'' and more''conversational.'' According to one person TLC-Depression talked too slowly as if ''he'' was trying to make sure that the user understood him and as a result sounded ''like an American trying to talk to a Frenchman!'' Another said that the systemsounded ''flat,'' elaborating, ''I kind of want to zone out when I am listening tothose, /C212less than half the days, more than half the days'' /C213[referring to the close-ended multiple choice options to questions in the symptom severity module]. Others, on theother hand, felt that cheer.'' For to sound more ''hu-man'' it should be less ''dramatic''. The phrase ''that /C213s GREAT'' (oered sometimes to give praise) was one example of the over-exuberance and drama that several of our participants objected to. One person requested that the word ''great''be said in a more subtle way. Another mentioned that ''people who are depressed areso judgmental. When I was not taking medication, the slightest thing ...like tone of voice because they are talking to a machine - [emphasis added]. You take everything so personal because you are not really connecting to the world.'' Another way for TLC-Depression to sound more ''human-like'' was to become more engaging. One common suggestion was for the system to know the name of the user, and repeat the name several times during the conversation. In fact, the sys- tem was designed to call users by their rst name. As we began our study, it took afew days to integrate the users /C213actual names into the system, thus participants were not addressed personally during their initial uses. Over a month /C213s participation, they were exposed to two dierent versions of TLC-Depression: one did not address themby name and one did. After using the system for a few days, and as users began tohear their names, we started hearing positive comments. One woman said: ''I like itwhen he says my name. I didn /C213t like it when he didn /C213t say my name.'' Several partic- ipants were pleasantly surprised when they realized that TLC remembered and re- ferred to the content of previous conversations. To them, this not only made thesystem more ''intelligent'' and human-like, but it also facilitated greater connection.We were applauded for having such a feature in our system. At the same time, some participants felt that TLC-Depression sounded ''condes- cending.'' One man said that the voice spoke to him as if he ''were a ve year old.''This opinion was also expressed by a woman who said ''it feels condescending.[praising me by saying] Good job! /C213You are not a cheerleader!''1176 R. Farzanfar et al. / Computers in Human Behavior 23 (2007) 1167-11823.1.2. Sounding like a health professional Many participants wanted to improve the TLC-Depression system so it sounded more like a ''professional'' human agent. For example, one woman said ''mostshrinks tend to be quieter and talk more slowly. They seem to be able to get tothe point where they are not extreme. A noncommittal tone is what seems to need to be in there.'' Another participant contrasted the TLC voice with the voice of his own psychiatrist: ''He is got this tone even in his casual conversation that is veryreassuring.'' 3.1.3. Sounding more sympathetic Most users said TLC-Depression did not express compassion and empathy ade- quately, which undercut its ''humanness.'' One woman said that she didn /C213t like the phrase, ''I am sorry''; it was more of a cliche \u00b4than a real expression of sympathy. She added ''that is the rst thing that brings them [patients] to depression - feeling sorry for themselves.'' Instead, she said that she preferred ''I sympathize with you,''adding ''I am sorry is like ...well ...if you feel sorry, what are you gonna do for me?'' There seems to be the expectation that the system would not only empathizewith those suering with depression, but provide concrete help as well, a reasonableexpectation for a counseling system. TLC-Depression /C213s lack of sympathy was especially evident to participants when suicidality was discussed. Feedback to users who reported suicidal /C212ideation, /C213/C212plan- ning /C213and /C212intent /C213was worded very carefully. Patients were told to call their clinicians immediately and/or go to the nearest emergency room depending upon urgency ofthe suicidality. Some felt that this response was not suciently ''sensitive'' or ''hu-man.'' Instead, TLC-Depression needed to demonstrate concern and sympathy forthe patient by conveying an appreciation of the anguish and distress a person expe-rienced. A more sensitive tone; one that indicated compassion and concern wasdesired. Some participants addressed the manner in which TLC-Depression re- sponded to patients. In the words of one, ''somehow ...[laughing] it was really kind of...- do not be so cheery about the fact I am about to jump out of a 30th floor window!'' To this participant, TLC-Depression communicated a cavalier attitudein the ''suicidality'' which was perceived as ''uncaring'': ''you are just kind ofbullshitting me. I am not going to take you very seriously.'' 3.1.4. It is not easy to be a machine: thus, bring in a human being Some participants strongly communicated that having a ''machine'' respond to their expressions of suicidal thoughts was insucient or inappropriate, even if the machine sounded like a human being. They advised us that after we provided our ''sympathetic'' and ''caring'' feedback to users in response to the suicidality ques-tions, we should direct users to a suicide hot line - an opportunity for users to talkto a liveperson - in addition to suggesting contact with the clinician or going to an emergency room. This response shows that despite making our best eorts tohave TLC-Depression sound more human-like, our evaluators wisely knew that itwas not possible to design a system that could fully address a suicidal person /C213s needs.R. Farzanfar et al. / Computers in Human Behavior 23 (2007) 1167-1182 1177One woman, an English teacher, oered to rewrite TLC-Depression /C213s responses in the suicidality section. After a few weeks, she sent us an email containing the rewrit-ten sections. The communication revealed the diculties she had experienced tryingto rewrite passages to make a ''machine'' sound ''caring,'' ''compassionate,'' and''eective'' enough to convincingly address a person /C213s suicidality state. Realizing the Herculean task she had undertaken, she wrote: ''It really is not easy being a ma- chine, to mis-quote Kermit the Frog!'' [Kermit the Frog /C213s remark was: ''It is not easy being green!''] 3.1.5. Actions taken Participants feedback prompted a number of modications in the content and communication style of TLC-Depression. The most important of which were thefollowing: (1) a comprehensive revision of the script that reduced the length of the conversation to ease burden on users; (2) re-writing the script that addressed TLC-Depression /C213s feedback to those with suicidal ideas and/or plans, to make re- sponses more empathetic and helpful; (3) TLC-Depression /C213s voice was changed from a man /C213s voice to a woman /C213s; (4) modication of words and phrases participants had criticized. 4. Discussion The vast and sophisticated literature on computer-mediated interactions ( Person et al., 2000; Bates, 1994; Nass et al. automated technologies as humanized proxies (Ambrose, 2001 ). The literature both describes and explains the interactive process between human agents and computers, including how people attribute human qual-ities and even human agency to machines ( Marakas, 2000; Friedman, 1997 ). The process can involve anthropomorphism, that is, the projection of human character- istic onto the non-human computer-mediated programs. Reeves and Nass (1996) suggest that human users tend to attribute social charac- teristics to computers in a ''mindless'' way while knowing and acknowledging thatcomputers are only machines. The authors believe that many assumptions that havebeen made about human-computer interaction, particularly about anthropomor-phism, are not valid. They challenge the notion that the users are psychologicallyor socially dysfunctional ( Turkle, 1984; Zubo, 1988 ) or need to project human qual- ities onto a computer because humans program the computers and thus there is a strong human element in the program ( Dennett, 1998 ). In presenting their empirical explorations of interaction between people and com- puters, Nass, Steuer, Henriksen, and Dryer (1994) use the term, ''ethopoeia'' to de- scribe their interpretation of the phenomenon. Ethopoeia, they write, ''involves adirect response to an entity as human while knowing that the entity does not warranthuman treatment or attribution ( Nass et al., 1994 ). The behavior occurs due to a response to ''contextual'' cues that direct attention to certain features in a phenom-1178 R. Farzanfar et al. / Computers in Human Behavior 23 (2007) 1167-1182enon while diminishing attention to others. In their view, we attribute human traits to computers when computers provide cues that all social actors use to communi-cate. The features used by computers to mimic the human characteristics includeuse of spoken language and human voice, interactivity, use of human forms and ges-tures, in screen-based systems, and generally ''lling of roles traditionally lled by humans.'' ( Nass & Moon, 2000 ). Our evaluation results corroborate Nass /C213s interpretation of human-computer interaction. Our users utilized metaphors to describe and give meaning to their expe- riences using TLC-Depression. Metaphors helped conceptualize perceptions by com-paring them with more familiar experiences such as interacting with mental healthprofessionals. The designers of TLC-Depression understood this potential and de-signed the system to maximally exploit it. The design thus included all the featuresthat, according to Nass and Moon (2000) enhance attribution of social agency. For example, TLC-Depression uses a ''human voice'' to ''converse'' with the user. The voice takes on the style and uses language expected of a therapist. The systemis ''interactive.'' It ''refers to itself'' as ''I'' the user'' by his/hername. The system ''knows'' personal and medical information about the user suchas his/her gender, age, past history of depression, what medications s/he takes, theuser /C213s clinician, etc. The system ''tracks'' the patient /C213s condition and self-care over time; it has memory. TLC-Depression provides information, advice and counseling.In some ways, it takes on attitudes of a ''helping professional.'' It is designed to re- spond emotionally, both in tone and content. It expresses empathy, delight and dis- appointment. The system is designed to communicate politely, never giving animpression of rudeness or hostility. In other words, the system is designed to behave and sound like a professional. It is not surprising, therefore, that our study participants spoke about the system as if it was a social and professional actor. When asked to suggest ways to improve it,the majority of evaluators tried to further ''humanize'' and''professionalize'' the sys- tem. The majority of participants believed that it would be a better experience for patients and more eective if the system sounded and behaved even more like a men- tal health professional. For example, several participants disapproved of TLC-Depression /C213s ''voice'' because, they said, the ''voice'' sounded ''mechanical'' and not suciently ''natural.'' Such comments made us realize that, especially in the ab-sence of visual cues, the tone of ''voice'' and its vocal delivery of the script were crit-ical components of a system that was designed to create an experience where, as oneparticipant aptly said, ''disbelief is suspended.'' At no time, however, did our partic-ipants ever forget or even have doubts about the ''inanimate'' nature of the auto- mated system they were using. Systems like TLC-Depression are deliberately designed to mimic a human agent. Their eectiveness probably depends on the extent to which they can behave like ahuman professional. However, if a user responds to cues as the system designers in-tended, it does not mean that the person is mistaking the machine for a human beingor, in Freudian terms having the illusion that there must be a mind or soul within the object. Early in the twentieth century, Freud rst used the term ''illusion,'' in hisbook on religion, (Freud, 1957) to describe a type of ''wishful thinking'' wherebyR. Farzanfar et al. / Computers in Human Behavior 23 (2007) 1167-1182 1179human agents ''project'' their ''desires, wishes, phobias,'' in short, the content of their subjectivity onto objects or onto the world as a whole. We did not observe such''illusion'' among users of TLC-Depression. What we did observe is clear: the users of TLC-Depression, aware of the elemen- tal attributes of the object they were interacting with, simply understood the system the way anyone living in a post-industrial society ''understands'' a television, a ''pet rock,'' an ATM machine or a computer system. The understanding is elicited by theobject itself: the object is a useful and instrumental means to a particular cognitiveand psychological stance - an outcome. The cognitive stance precludes any enduringconsideration of the object as actually human. Suggestions for improvement of TLC-Depression were made by users who were conscious of the fundamental dierence between the object they were using and ahuman being. They did not unconsciously create an illusion of the system as human. To our participants, the system was supposed to function like a health professional, that is, sound and speak as if it understood the anguish and suering of a person withdepression. It was supposed to respond as a mental health care provider would. Ourresults suggest that the construct ''anthropomorphism'' is overdrawn, and does notadequately portray a nuanced picture of complexities in the human-computerinterface.

Our goal is to a pply statistical methods which are appropriate for analyzing longitudinal data to a repeated measur es epidemiological study as a tutorial in the appropriate use and interpretation of random effe cts models. To motivate their use, we study the association of alcohol consumption on markers of HIV disease progressio n in an observational cohort. To make valid inferences, the associatio n among measurements correlated within a subject must be taken into account. We describe a linear mixed effe cts regression framework that accounts for the clustering of longitudinal data and that can be fit using standa rd statistical software. We apply the linear mixed effects model to a previously publ ished dataset of HIV infected indivi duals with a history of alcohol problems who are receiving HAART (n = 197). Th e researchers were inte rested in determining the effect of alcohol use on HIV disease progre ssion over time. Fitting a linear mixed effects multiple regression model with a random intercep t and random slope for ea ch subject accounts for the association of observations wi thin subjects and yields paramete rs interpretable as in ordinary multiple regression. A significant interaction between alcohol use and adherence to HAART is found: subjects who use alcohol and are not fully adherent to their HIV medications had higher log RNA (ribonucleic acid) viral load levels than fu lly adherent non-drinkers, fully adherent alcohol users, and non-drinkers who were not fully adherent. Longitudinal studies are increasi ngly common in epidemiological research. Software routines that account for correlation between repeated measures using linear mixed effects methods are now generally available and straightforw ard to utilize. These models allow the relaxation of assumptions needed for approaches such as repeated measures ANOVA, and sh ould be routinely incorporated into the analysis of cohort studies.Published: 19 September 2007 Epidemiologic Perspectives & Innovations 2007, 4:8 doi:10.1186/1742-5573-4-8Received: 4 May 2006 Accepted: 19 September 2007 This article is available from: http:/ /www.epi-perspectives.com/content/4/1/8 \u00a9 2007 Finucane et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

HIV infection hasmajor health consequences, with estimates of 940,000infected Americans [2]. These two health concerns arerelated, and alcohol problems have been reported to be more prevalent in HIV-infected patients. Among 665 patients who were establishing primary care for HIV infec-tion, half were determined to have an alcohol problembased on the CAGE questionnaire or clinical assessment[3]. Before the advent of highly active antiretroviral ther-apy (HAART), however no association between alcohol use and HIV disease progression was found [4]. Samet et al. [5] hypothesized that in the age of HAART, alcohol use,because of its potential interaction with a variety of HIVclinical issues including medication adherence, mightaccelerate HIV disease progression. They found that,among a cohort of HIV-infected individuals with a historyof alcohol problems (the HIV-Alcohol Longitudinal Cohort, or HIV-ALC), those individuals receiving HAART and consuming alcohol had significantly higher viral RNA(ribonucleic acid) levels at baseline. In this paper, we provide a tutorial on linear mixed effect models to study repeated measures in this dataset includ- ing follow-up data collected on subjects in the HIV-ALC cohort [6]. Longitudinal cohort studies have the advan-tage of providing detailed information about how a givenset of variables changes over time in an individual patientand of facilitating the study of the factors that influencethis change. By collecting repeated measurements, we gain the ability to distinguish between the degree of variation across time for one person (within-individual change),and the variation among people (between-individualchange). However, longitudinal studies present some sta-tistical complexities, since the customary assumption thatall observations are independent usually does not hold. In addition to the usual assumptions of regression meth- ods, models for a single outcome assume that all observa-tions of a particular variable are independent of oneanother: knowing the value of one observation of a varia-ble provides no information about the others, after con-trolling for known covariates. This assumption does not hold true in longitudinal studies, however, as multiple observations of a variable on a particular person are likelypositively correlated (i.e. the errors may reflect a system-atic trend within each individual). One approach to this problem involves excluding all fol- lowup data from the analysis and using only the baseline data from the cohort - in this single-time-point subset ofthe original dataset, the assumption of independence ofobservations is plausible. However, this method utilizesonly part of the available data, and is highly inefficient and inadvisable. Unless the correlation is quite high between baseline and follow-up data, such an inefficientapproach will lead to less precise estimates, and does notallow for assessment of time-varying exposures and out-comes. Another approach is to assume that repeated measure- ments on an individual are independent despite the factthat they are likely correlated. This may introduce biasinto the estimates of variability of the models' parameters,and is not recommended (see [7] for a case study of theperils of this mis-modeling). A more principled approach, which we will illustrate in this paper, involves modeling the within-individual relat-edness (clustering) of measurements in order to make useof all the data and simultaneously obtain unbiased esti-mates of parameter variability. Although models that takethis clustering into consideration are more complicated, they are also more powerful since they facilitate the study of change over time. These issues have received a greatdeal of attention in the statistical literature in recent years,and the books by Diggle and colleagues [8] and Fitzmau-rice, Laird and Ware [9] provide excellent overviews of thefield. A classic method used to account for repeated measure- ments in linear models is repeated measures analysis ofvariance (RM-ANOVA). This model was developed for set-tings with discrete covariates, complete data, and com-mon measurement occasions for all subjects [9]. This approach has some disadvantages in practice, however, since in many longitudinal studies observations may beunbalanced and/or incomplete and assumptions regard-ing equal covariance between all observations may not betenable [10]. As we will illustrate, other approaches, suchas the linear mixed effects model that we describe, are more attractive in this setting. In this paper, we describe the linear mixed effects (LME) or random effects/random coefficients model of Laird &Ware [11], a versatile model that accounts for clustering.Other approaches to estimation in this setting are dis-cussed by Fitzmaurice et al. [9]. The LME approach pro- vides a flexible yet parsimonious way of modeling the association among repeated measurements. These within-subject associations are often of secondary interest in lon-gitudinal studies and the parameters that describe them inthe LME model are thus termed nuisance parameters . The substantive parameters are those that describe the relation- ship of primary interest between study variables. The LME approach estimates the nuisance parameters and substan-tive parameters simultaneously, yielding consistent esti-Epidemiologic Perspectives & Innovations 2007, 4:8 http://www.epi-perspec tives.com/content/4/1/8 Page 3 of 14 (page number not for citation purposes)mates of the substantive parameters if the model for the covariance and the mean are appropriately specified. Samet et al. [5] conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the baseline data from a cohort of HIV-infected individualswith a history of alcohol problems (HIV-ALC). In a multi-ple linear regression model that controlled for a number of potential confounding variables, they found that among subjects who were on HIV medications, those sub-jects who used any alcohol (moderate or at risk use) hadsignificantly higher mean viral log RNA levels (p = .006)than subjects who reported no drinking (fully abstinent)during the previous 30 days; this association was attenu- ated (p = 0.04) when adherence to HIV medications was included as a predictor in the model. Further analysis ofdata from this cohort has been reported [6]. In this paper, we will fit LME models to conduct a second- ary analysis, using longitudinal methods to furtherexplore the issues they considered in their baseline analy- sis. The goal of our analysis will be to explicate linear mixed effects models in the context of understanding theassociation between alcohol consumption and the pro-gression of HIV/AIDS. Using repeated measures data willallow us to take full advantage of all information availablein this cohort study and to assess how the associations between alcohol use and HIV RNA levels changed over time. Use of the LME is preferable to other approachessuch as classical RM-ANOVA, because it allows looseningof assumptions that may not be tenable. While thesemethods are particularly well-suited to the analysis weconsider, they are also applicable to many other types of longitudinal epidemiology studies. Analysis Methods We perform a secondary analysis of the HIV-Alcohol Lon- gitudinal Cohort (HIV-ALC), a follow-up study of HIV- infected patients with past or current history of alcohol problems. The primary purpose of this longitudinalcohort was to examine HIV progression of these subjects,and prior results have been published previously [12-14].Participants were recruited between July 1997 and July2001. All participants resided in the Greater Boston areaand were recruited through the following sources: Boston Medical Center (BMC) Diagnostic Evaluation Unit (56%), posted fliers (17%), BMC Primary Care Clinic(13%), respite facility homeless persons (5%), metha-done clinic (4%), subject referrals (4%), Personsrecruited outside BMC or BIDMC were pre-screened by telephone, and potentially eligible individuals were invited to complete the screening process in person. TheInstitutional Review Boards (IRB) of BMC, BIDMC andSmith College approved this study.Patients who were HIV-infected and had a history of alco- hol problems were identified by explicit eligibility criteria: confirmed HIV infection and a history of alcohol prob-lems. Patients not receiving care at BMC or BIDMC wereasked to document their HIV diagnosis by providingeither HIV testing documentation or their HIV prescrip-tion medications. Clinical assessment (in 10% of partici- pants) or 2 or more positive responses to the CAGE questionnaire (in 90%) were used to identify participantswith the criterion 'history of alcohol problems.' The CAGEquestionnaire [15] is a short, validated questionnaire withgood reliability in identifying problem drinkers. Diagnos-tic interviews for alcohol problems in a sub-sample of CAGE-positive subjects (n = 141) revealed a lifetime his- tory of alcohol dependence (80%) or abuse (15%) [3].Additional entry criteria included the following: evidenceof unimpaired cognitive function as determined by a scoreof 21 or more on the Mini Mental State Examination [16];no plans to leave the Boston area during the subsequent 2years; and fluency in English or Spanish. For the Spanish interview instrument, standardized scales in Spanish were used when available; the remainder of the questionnairewas translated from English into Spanish, back-translatedand revised. There were 444 eligible subjects screened at these various sites, 350 (79%) provided informed consent and agreed to participate in the study. After providing informed con-sent, subjects were scheduled to be interviewed every 6months for a maximum of 7 visits. Since no follow-upoccurred after July 2001, subjects enrolled late in the studyhad only a baseline assessment and a small number of fol- low-up visits. Laboratory values of HIV RNA measured within 3 months of each visit were obtained from medicalrecords whenever available. If not measured during rou-tine clinical care, blood samples were drawn during thevisit by nursing staff and tested for HIV RNA level. Partic-ipants were compensated US$20 or an equivalent gift cer- tificate to a local grocery store. In this paper we analyze the subset of this cohort made up of all participants receiv-ing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at base-line (n = 197). Outcome variable The base 10 log of one plus the viral load of HIV RNA (log(RNA+1)) was used as a primary outcome of HIV dis- ease progression in the HIV-ALC study. Measurement ofHIV RNA was performed using branched-chain DNA tech-niques [17]. The lower threshold for detection at the timeof the study was 50 copies/ml - values < 50 were analyzedas 0. We note that this approach is somewhat ad-hoc, and more principled approaches have been developed [18].Epidemiologic Perspectives & Innovations 2007, 4:8 http://www.epi-perspec tives.com/content/4/1/8 Page 4 of 14 (page number not for citation purposes)Measures of alcohol consumption In the HIV-ALC study, alcohol use in the 30 days before each interview was used as a measure of the usual patternof use. To encourage accurate reporting of alcohol con-sumption, breath alcohol level was also measured beforethe interview [19]. Alcohol consumption was calculatedusing alcohol quantity and frequency questions as well as the Addiction Severity Index, an assessment instrument with well-documented reliability and validity in this pop-ulation [20]. Alcohol use was initially classified as 'absti-nent', 'moderate', or 'at-risk', based on the NationalInstitute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) rec-ommendations, which define at risk drinking as more than 14 drinks per week (or more than four in one day) for men, and more than seven drinks per week (or morethan three in one day) for women [1]. Any alcohol con-sumption below these levels was considered moderate usein this study. Following the approach of Samet et al [5], adichotomous indicator of any consumption (yes/no) wasused in this analysis. Alcohol use was measured at each study visit and thus varied over time. Measures of adherence to HIV medication Adherence to HAART was self-reported using the AIDS Clinical Trials Group instrument. Subjects reported thenames of their antiretroviral medications as well as the number of doses and the total number of pills prescribed and taken daily [21]. The 3-day self-reported number ofpills missed was computed for each HIV medication.Adherence was defined as a proportion of prescribeddoses taken (0-1). Other factors Basic demographic information included each partici-pant's age in years, race/ethnicity (4 groups: black, white,Latino, other), and gender. Homelessness was defined asspending at least one night in a shelter or on the street inthe 6 months prior to the interview. The number of doses of therapy each subject received per day was also recorded. A group of 151 subjects in the cohort participated in a ran-domized controlled trial of a HAART adherence interven-tion [22]. Involvement in the ADHERE trial was includedas a three-category variable in our analysis (intervention/control/not enrolled). Another three-category variablewas included that described a subject's primary HIV risk factor: injection drug use, men having sex with men, or heterosexual sex. Finally, to assess whether there were anyimportant cohort effects due to date of entry in the study,we categorized subjects according to the year in whichthey entered the study (1997-2001). In this secondary analysis we wanted to replicate the results of Samet et al [5] relating to adherence and alcoholconsumption, while utilizing the additional informationregarding follow-up observations. In addition, weextended the previous analysis to assess whether subjects' adherence to medications was acting as an effect modifier for the association of alcohol consumption with HIV pro-gression, i.e. whether the effect that alcohol had on RNAlevels differed across degrees of HAART adherence. Statistical methods using linear mixed effects regression models We fit linear mixed effects (LME) regression models ([9,11]) for log(RNA+1) levels over time. To help groundthe discussion of these models in the context of our exam-ple, we display (in Figure 1) the observed log(RNA+1) lev-els, adherence percentages, and alcohol abstinence values (yes/no) for a sample of nine subjects. LME models account for clustering of longitudinal data points (forexample, note that subject 4011's log(RNA+1) values areconsistently higher than subject 4189's) and thus providevalid estimates of the regression parameters of interestand their standard error. LME methods are also attractivein this setting because, unlike classical repeated measures ANOVA [22], they can loosen assumptions regarding the form of associations within subjects and incorporateimbalance in longitudinal data (note that subject 4180 isonly observed at baseline, whereas subject 4129 has sixfollow-up visits). Furthermore, LME models distinguishwithin-subject from between-subject sources of variation, and also describe how individual and population mean response trajectories change over time. At the same time,LME models are particularly useful because their covari-ance structures can often be described in a flexible andparsimonious fashion. The underlying premise of LME methods is that an out- come of interest is determined by some factors that affectall subjects in the same way and by other factors that affectindividuals in different ways. This premise is reflected inthe LME model by dividing the mean model regressionparameters into two distinct groups: fixed effects (or pop- ulation effects) and random effects (or subject-specific effects). The fixed effect parameters are shared by theentire study population. The other parameters, the ran-dom effects, are allowed to vary randomly from one indi-vidual to another. These random effects are attractivebecause one participant's RNA levels might consistentlybe higher than the mean while another's might be lower due to unmeasured factors such as genetic make-up, immunologic factors, HIV mutations conferring resist-ance, environment, education, personal habits, etc. Thesedifferences would be reflected in the random-effects por-tion of the model, thus allowing each individual to havehis/her own subject-specific mean response trajectory over time. These random effects parameters reflect the nat- ural heterogeneity of the population and thus account forwithin-individual clustering of data points.Epidemiologic Perspectives & Innovations 2007, 4:8 http://www.epi-perspec tives.com/content/4/1/8 Page 5 of 14 (page number not for citation purposes)Observed log(RNA+1), adherence and abstin ence status over time for 9 subjects Figure 1 Observed log(RNA+1), adherence and abstin ence status over time for 9 04 00123456 timelog RNA671 3 02 03 04 00123456 timelog RNA100 83 100 100 100 67 YYYYYY4040 % ad h abst? 0 1 02 03 04 00123456 timelog RNA100 100 100 33 100 100 YNYNN Y4048 % ad h abst? 0 1 02 03 04 00123456 timelog RNA100 0 100 67 NNY N4065 % ad abst? 0 1 02 03 04 00123456 timelog RNA0 100 83 67 33 NYNN N4079 % abst? 0 1 02 03 04 00123456 timelog RNA100 100 83 67 83 95 100 YNNNNNY4129 % ad h abst? 0 1 02 03 04 00123456 timelog RNA100 Y4180 03 04 00123456 timelog RNA100 100 100 100 87 100 YYYNYN4189 % ad h abst? 0 1 02 03 04 00123456 timelog RNA78 N4361 & Innovations 2007, 4:8 http://www.epi-perspec tives.com/content/4/1/8 Page 6 of 14 (page number not for citation purposes)In the LME framework, each participant's outcome trajec- tory is modeled as a combination of the population char- acteristics that are assumed to be shared by all individuals(fixed effects), and that individual's unique subject spe-cific effects (random effects). The mean response trajec-tory in the population is obtained using a weightedaverage of the random effects, which are almost always a subset of the fixed effects. We will now introduce two important special cases of the LME model using the nota-tion of Fitzmaurice et al. [9]. Random intercept model The most straightforward case of a linear mixed-effects model is one in which each subject has only one random effect - a randomly determined intercept (or individuallevel). This model assumes that controlling for a subject'slevel (intercept) sufficiently accounts for the associationbetween repeated measurements. To illustrate this approach, consider a study with only two time-points and two levels of drinking. In this study, sub- ject i's predicted log(RNA+1) level at time-point given by: E ij|ti, = 3drkij + bi /H11568 0 is the population's average intercept. /H11568 t1 and t2 are dummy variables for time; 1 and 2 are their associated fixed effect regression parameters. /H11568 drkij = 1 if person i was using alcohol at time j, drkij = 0 if person i was abstaining at time j; 3 describes the popula- tion effect of alcohol use on log(RNA+1) levels. /H11568 bi is person i's random intercept. In particular, bi repre- sents the deviation of the ith individual's intercept from the population's intercept 0. By averaging over the distribution of the subject-specific effects bi, we obtain the mean response profile in the pop- ulation characterized by the fixed effect regression param-eters of interest: In Figure 2, we use an illustration due to Fitzmaurice et al. [9] to demonstrate how this model could be applied in asimple example. In this example, as shown on the left sideof the Figure, person A's measurements are consistentlyhigher than person B. Thus, person A would have a posi-tive random intercept term ( b A > 0) whereas person B's random intercept would be negative ( bB < 0). The individ- uals' observed responses are allowed to vary randomly above and below their conditional mean trajectoriesbecause of the inclusion of the error terms eij. (In this example, eA1 is positive whereas eA2 is negative.) By averag- ing over these random effects, we obtain the marginal mean response trajectory, M, the predicted outcome tra-jectory for an 'average' subject in the population,described using the fixed effects parameters. The usefulness of the random intercept model however, is limited by the fact that this model constrains the correla- tion between repeated measurements to be the same nomatter how close or far apart in time the measurementsare taken. For example, in a study with six time-points, therandom intercept model makes the restrictive assumptionthat the correlation between subject i's first and second measurements is the same as the correlation between sub- ject i's first and sixth measurements: corr (Y i1, Yi2) = corr (Yi1, Yi6). This assumption of time-invariant correlation is likely to be unrealistic for repeated observation of HIVRNA (e.g. we would expect two consecutive measure-ments to be more tightly correlated than two measure-ments taken far apart in time). We will now introduce a more flexible model that allows correlations between repeated measures to change over time.RNA t t drkji i i j=+ + + 01 12 23 .Hypothetical observed and pred icted lines for two subjects from random intercept and random slope modelFigure 2 Hypothetical observed and pred icted lines for two subjects from random intercept and random slope model.0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35012345Random Intercept study time (months)log(RNA+1)A M B 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35012345Random Intercept & Slope study time (months)log(RNA+1)Epidemiologic Perspectives & Innovations 2007, 4:8 http://www.epi-perspec tives.com/content/4/1/8 Page 7 of 14 (page number not for citation purposes)Random intercept and slope model Another set of random effects covariance structures, which makes less restrictive assumptions about the associationsbetween measurements, arises when additional parame-ters (besides the intercept) are considered random andsubject-specific. The random intercept and slope modelallows both the intercept and slope to vary randomly among subjects. The model given above would thus change slightly: E [RNA ij|ti, drkij, subject i's random intercept. /H11568 b1i is subject i's random slope. The random intercept and slope model can best be under- stood by considering another simple two-person experi-ment, depicted on the right side of Figure 2, again due toFitzmaurice et al. [9]. In this example, person A's intercept and slope are greater than the mean intercept and slope respectively ( b 0A > 0, b1A > 0) because his or her measure- ments are on average higher than the average in the groupand are also increasing at a faster rate. By the same token,the intercept and slope of person B are less than the pop-ulation averages for intercept and slope ( b 0B < 0, b1B < 0). So, the mean trajectory has intercept 0 and slope 1; per- son A has intercept 0 + b0A > 0 and slope 1 + b1A > 1; person B has intercept 0 + b0B < 0 and slope 1 + b1B <1. As was the case in the random intercept model, the inclu-sion of the error terms e ij allows the observed measure- ments to deviate randomly from the subject-specific trajectories. Importantly, the covariance structure of this model is less restrictive than the random intercept model. In particular,the random intercept and slope model allows correlationsbetween measurements to change with time - the correla- tion between Y ij and Yik is modeled as a function of the times of measurement. To illustrate the increase in flexi-bility that comes from including a random slope, wereturn to the example of the HIV-ALC dataset, noting thatin the random-intercept model, the correlation betweenany two measurements on the same person, regardless ofhow far apart they were in time, was constrained to be corr (Y ij, Yik) = 0.40. The addition of a random slope, however, allowed this quantity to vary according to the times ofmeasurement: in the random-intercept-and-slope model,corr (Y i0, Yi6) = 0.47 and corr (Yi0, Yi36) = 0.16. This agrees with intuition - one would expect measurements of viralRNA made 6 months apart in time to be more tightly cor- related than measurements made three years apart. In addressing the HIV data analysis with repeated measure-ments taken months apart, this is an attractive feature, andwe adopted this approach.Estimation of the regression parameters of interest as well as the variance-covariance matrix of the random effects (assuming multivariate normality) proceeds simultane-ously. Two options for maximization include a standardlikelihood or a restricted likelihood (REML), where theformer is biased in small samples. An extensive discussionof estimation can be found in [11]. It is often the case that primary scientific interest lies in the interpretation of the parameters that describe the meanand subject-specific trajectories. An appealing feature ofLME models is that after the within-subject associationhas been accounted for (using either the random intercept model, the random intercept and slope model, or a more complex model), the nuisance parameters that describethis covariance structure can typically be ignored andfocus can be given to interpreting the substantive parame-ters. Settings where the variance parameters are of interestin their own right (such as studies of observer variation)can be accommodated by LME models as well. While we have focused on models for responses that are approximately Gaussian, extensions to other types of out-comes (e.g. counts or dichotomous variables) have beenundertaken using the mixed effects framework. The text byFitzmaurice, Laird and Ware [9] provides an accessible introduction to random effects for the generalized linear model. We now turn to the specification of the log(RNA+1) regression model for the fixed effects parameters. Theinclusion of follow-up data in our analysis enabled us to study the effect of time on HIV RNA levels as well as the interaction between time and alcohol use, our covariate ofprimary interest. Entry into the study was not linked toany treatment or clinical event, and we therefore had nospecific hypotheses about relationships among time,time-varying measures of alcohol consumption and adherence, and changes in log(RNA+1) viral loads. We included a relatively rich set of covariates into our lin- ear mixed effects model, incorporating: time (df = 6), age,race/ethnicity (df = 3), gender, any report of homeless-ness, number of doses of HAART prescribed per day,adherence to HAART, involvement in the ADHERE study (df = 2) [22], year of entry into the HIV-ALC study, and primary HIV risk factor. We justified the use of this 'inclu-sive approach' [23] in two ways. First, any of these varia-bles could potentially be a confounder of the relationshipof interest. Second, in a study in which only 44% ofintended observations were made, the inclusion of what Collins et al. [23] call 'auxiliary variables' is suggested. While the focus of this paper is not on missing data, wenote that LME methodology yields consistent estimateswhen missing data are missing at random in the sense ofEpidemiologic Perspectives & Innovations 2007, 4:8 http://www.epi-perspec tives.com/content/4/1/8 Page 8 of 14 (page number not for citation purposes)Little and Rubin [24]. Informally, this means that miss- ingness is ignorable when it is related only to observed quantities. By incorporation of additional informationalready collected in the study, assumptions regarding theignorability of missing data become more plausible (yetwe note that the validity of the assumption of ignorabilityremains inherently untestable without additional data regarding missing observations). Pairwise interactions between time, alcohol consumption and adherence were included in the model, and retainedif their p-values were less than 0.10. These interactionswere considered because there was substantive interest in these factors. Because of the complications in interpreting multiple degree of freedom interactions, only thoseachieving a modest degree of statistical significance wereincluded in the final model. In the cross-sectional analysis conducted by Samet et al. [5], controlling for adherence to HAART yielded attenu- ated results (p = 0.04 as opposed to p = .006). To further explore whether adherence might be an effect modifier ofthe drinking/RNA association (i.e. whether the effect ofdrinking on RNA was modified depending on the valuesof adherence), we decided to test for the significance ofthe interaction effect between alcohol use and adherence in our model. This effect was moderately significant (p = .02) and the interaction was retained. R version 2.4.1 andSAS version 9.1 were used for estimation. The Appendixprovides the syntax needed to fit the LME model in threegeneral purpose statistical packages: R, SAS and Stata. Results Table 1 describes the analytic sample of the HIV-ALCcohort on HAART. Key characteristics include the follow-ing: 58% report injection drug use as their primary 22% are homeless; 40% currently using alco-hol, 18% are female, and the average age is 40 years. Table 2 displays the results of the multiple longitudinal LME regression model of log(RNA+1) levels. Alcohol usewas a significant predictor of log(RNA+1) levels withabstainers having lower levels of RNA on average. Therewas a significant interaction between alcohol consump-tion and adherence (p = 0.02) and the interaction was retained. Subjects who used alcohol and were less adher- ent to their medications had significantly higherlog(RNA+1) levels than non-drinkers who had betteradherence to their HAART regimens, alcohol users whohad better adherence to their HAART regimens, and non- Table 1: Characteristics of the HIV-ALC Cohort on HAART at baseline (n = 197) Percent Count Primary HIV risk factor Men sex with men 21% 42Injection drug use 58% 115Heterosexual sex 20% 80 White 37% 73 Latino 22% 43 Other 1% 1 Uses alcohol 40% 79 Female 18% 36 Homeless 22% 43 Enrollment year 1997 10% 19 1998 33% 65 1999 37% 72 2000 16% 32 2001 5% 9 ADHERE enrollment Not enrolled 49% 96 Control 26% 52 Intervention 25% 49 Mean (SD) min, max Doses of HAART/day 5.0 (1.6) 2, 103 day HAART adherence 0.9 (0.2) 0, 1 Age 40.8 (7.4) 19.5,66.2 Log 10(RNA+1) 2.0 (1.9) 0, 5.7 Note: due to rounding some values may not sum to 100%Epidemiologic Perspectives & Innovations 2007, 4:8 http://www.epi-perspec tives.com/content/4/1/8 Page 9 of 14 (page number not for citation purposes)drinkers who were less adherent to their HAART regimens. To help interpret the statistically significant interactionbetween alcohol consumption and adherence, Figure 3shows the predicted log(1 + RNA) trajectories over timefor four hypothetical subjects, one who doesn't drink andis 100% adherent, one who doesn't drink and is 0% adherent, one who uses alcohol and is 100% adherent, and one who uses alcohol and is 0% adherent (each hypo-thetical subject represents an 'average' subject with respectto baseline covariates). The time by adherence interactioneffect was dropped as there was little evidence that itadded to the model (p = 0.65). To assess the value of incorporating follow-up data, we also fit a cross-sectional model utilizing only data fromthe baseline timepoint (n = 197, Table 3). The significanceof the alcohol consumption by adherence interaction was attenuated (p = 0.053), in part due to the reduced samplesize. We also assessed the importance of accounting for cluster- ing, by fitting a model for all time points that inappropri- ately ignored the correlation. This incorrect model yielded a spuriously statistically significant interaction effect foralcohol consumption and adherence (p = 0.0006). For any model, it is important to verify assumptions made in estimation. For the LME random intercept and slope model, in addition to assumptions of standard multiple regression models, estimation proceeds assuming that thedistribution of the random intercepts and slopes isapproximately bivariate normal.

Neither histogram presentsstrong evidence against the normality assumption.Figure 6 displays the scatterplot of random slopes and intercepts, which appears to be a cloud of points consist- ent with a bivariate normal density, albeit with a numberof points on the line given by slope = -.02*intercept. The9 subjects labeled in Figure 1 are indicated to help inter-pret this scatterplot. For subjects with only one observa-tion (e.g. 4180, 4361) the predicted slope is essentially borrowed from other values within the sample. Many of the subjects in the HIV-ALC cohort were observed at only1 timepoint. The negative correlation (-0.53) of the cloudof points indicates that there is an inverse associationbetween intercepts and slopes: subjects with lowlog(RNA+1) values at baseline are likely to see increases in log(RNA+1) values over time (i.e. have more potential for increase), while subjects with high log(RNA+1) values atbaseline are likely to decrease over time. Subjects whoselog(RNA+1) values increased over time had positive ran-dom slopes (e.g. 4065, 4048) while subjects with adecrease had negative slopes (e.g. 4189 and 4140). Conclusion Our primary goal was to motivate and illustrate the use oflinear mixed effect regression models for longitudinal epi-demiologic data in an alcohol research setting. Using theLME model to account for clustering within subject ena-bled us to make full use of the available data. Whereas Samet et al. [5] conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the baseline data from the HIV-ALC cohort, we analyzed datacollected at 7 different timepoints. By utilizing this addi-tional information, we were able to detect the subtle inter-action effect between adherence and alcohol Table 3: Summary of Linear Regression Model of Log10(RNA+1) at baseline (n = 197 observations) Est (SE) p-value Multiple df p-value Intercept 1.0 (1.3) .43 Drink 2.6 (1.2) .03Adherence -.37 (1.0) .71Drink*Adherence -2.4 (1.2) .05Age 0.0 (.37) .12Homeless .44 (.32) .18 Doses/day -.07 (.09) .43 Enrollment year .32 (.14) .02Race/ethnicity .94 (df = 3) Black .06 (.32) .84Latino .06 (.36) .88Other 1.2 (1.8) .53 White 0 .

While the sub-stantive conclusions regarding this interaction are similarin both models, the potential efficiency gain of including all available observations should not be dismissed. The results of our analysis suggest that for this sample of sub-jects with a history of alcohol problems either adhering toone's HAART regimen, or abstaining from alcohol was sig-nificantly associated with relatively lower levels oflog(RNA+1) viral load. Limitations of this investigationinclude self-report of alcohol consumption and adher- ence, missing data, and relatively modest sample size. We also note the possibility that effects of readiness to changeas a predictor of subsequent drinking behavior may bemediated/moderated by factors such as \"self-efficacy,\"which the current analyses do not directly address. Furtherexploration of the interacting effects of drinking and adherence thus seems merited. The linear mixed effects models that we have described provide a flexible structure for modeling the covarianceamong repeated observations, thus yielding valid esti- mates of regression parameter variances. We concur withthe advice of Fitzmaurice and colleagues who stated thatgiven modern computing capabilities, which support awider class of models for longitudinal data, \"there is little reason to analyze longitudinal data under the inherent limitations and constraints imposed by the repeatedmeasures ANOVA model\" [9]. After the association in longitudinal studies has been accounted for, focus can shift to interpreting the substan-tive parameters that describe the relationships of scientific interest. The interpretation of parameters from a multiple regression model is of crucial importance, and a similarprocess of interpretation is needed for the LME model. Extensions to non-normally distributed outcomes (e.g. binary or count outcomes), while not discussed in detail here, are tractable, as routines to fit both linear and non- linear models exist in general purpose statistical software(including but not limited to R, SAS, S-plus, SPSS, andStata). While there are a number of additional complica-Histogram of random slopes from random slope model (plus normal density)Figure 5 Histogram of random slopes from random slope model (plus normal density).Histogram of random slope model (plus normal density)Figure 4 Histogram of random intercepts from random slope model (plus normal density).Histogram of tives.com/content/4/1/8 Page 12 of 14 (page number not for citation purposes)tions in fitting non-linear models, in terms of computa- tional requirements and convergence, the generalframework is analogous to the linear setting that we describe. These models are applicable to a wide range of outcomes arising in alcohol studies, and should be uti-lized routinely. Incomplete observations arise in most longitudinal stud- ies. It is rarely, if ever, the case that every planned meas-urement can be successfully obtained; some subset of these intended measurements are often missing. LME methods incorporate incomplete data under the assump-tion that missingness is at random (MAR, not related tounobserved quantities). Although estimates made underMAR have been shown to be relatively robust to smalldeviations from this assumption [23] this is not always true, and it is important to consider whether this (untest- able) assumption is tenable. An extensive literature existsregarding the use of non-ignorable non-response modelsto assess sensitivity to the MAR assumption [25].As with any model, verification of other assumptions (residual analysis, examination of influential points, etc.) is critically important. We focused attention on assump-tions of normality of the random effects parameters, butother model-checking is always indicated. The multiple-bias methods of Greenland [26] provide a general frame-work for consideration of non-sampling errors that could affect results in substantial ways. In this report we have provided a brief introduction and application of LME models, but have only touched onmany important issues and have neglected other crucialaspects. More comprehensive descriptions of these meth- ods exist (e.g. [8,9]) and are appropriate next steps for analysts considering use of these models. In addition,other approaches to the analysis of longitudinal or clus-tered data have been proposed. The population averagedgeneralized estimating equation (GEE) approach of Liangand Zeger [27] is another feasible approach, particularlyfor non-normally distributed outcomes. Extensions of the random effects framework using Bayesian estimation [28] have been utilized to address additional complexities andloosen assumptions (i.e. use of a t distribution rather thana normal distribution for the random effects). Finally,latent variable models [29] provide an attractive frame-work with a similar flavor, with implementations availa- ble (e.g. Stata and Mplus). These models extend the random effects model to fit multilevel factor and itemresponse models, latent class models, and multilevelstructural equation models.

Kraemer\", Richard SaitzC,f, Lewis H. Kuller\" and Jeffrey H. Samet?\" Objective: To examine the association between hepatitis C and prevalent cardiovas\u00ad cular disease (CVD) among HIV-infected individuals. Design: A cross-sectional analysis of data from the HIV -Longitudinal Interrelationships of Viruses and Ethanol (HIV-L1VE) cohort, a prospective cohort of HIV-infected individuals with current or past alcohol problems. Methods: We analysed health questionnaire and laboratory data from 395 HIV\u00ad infected individuals (50.1% co-infected with hepatitis C) using logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for the prevalence of CVD among those co-infected with hepatitis C and HIV compared with those infected with HIV alone. Results: The prevalence of CVD was higher among those co-infected with hepatitis C compared with those with HIV alone (11.1 versus 2.5%, respectively). After adjusting for age, the OR for the prevalence of CVD was significantly higher among those with hepatitis C co-infection (adjusted OR 4.65, 95% confidence interval 1.70-12.71 ). The relationship between hepatitis C and CVD persisted when adjusting for age and other sociodemographic characteristics, substance use, and cardiovascular risk factors in separate regression models. Conclusion: Co-infection with hepatitis C among a cohort of HIV-infected individuals was associated with a higher age-adjusted odds for the prevalence of CVD. These data suggest that hepatitis C infection may be associated with an increased risk of CVD among those co-infected with HIV. \u00a9 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins AIDS 2007,21:193-197 Keywords: Cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular risk factors, hepatitis C, HIV, myocardial infarction, substance abuse From the \"Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA,USA,the \"Departrnent of Epidemiology, University of Pittsburgh GraduateSchool of Public Health, Pittsburgh, PA, USA, the cClinical Addiction Research and Education (CARE) Unit, Section of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Boston Medical Centerand BostonUniversity School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA,the dDepartments ofBiostatistics, and \"Social and Behavioral Sciences, and the 'Youth Alcohol Prevention Center and Department of Epidemiology, Boston University Schoof of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.

Studies suggest that there isalink between some infectious pathogens and atherosclerosis [1,2]. The mechanism for the develop\u00ad ment of atherosclerosis may be colonization of the vasculature by the pathogen [3] or stimulation of the inflammatory cascade [4]. Some studies have reported a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors [5,6], carotid atherosclerosis [7-9] and coronary heart disease [10] among individuals with hepatitis C infection. In contrast, other studies found no such association [11-13], but were limited by the number of hepatitis C-infected participants [11.] and the lack of hepatitis C viral RNA [11-13] and substance use data. The absence of information on injection drug, cocaine and alcohol use could confound the relationship between hepatitis C and CVD [11,12]. With the advent of antiretroviral therapy and prolonged survival, coronary heart disease is now common among individuals with HIV infection [14]. Of those infected with HIV, studies have reported co-infection with hepatitis C ranging from 16.1% [15] up to 30% [16]. Compared with individuals infected only with HIV or hepatitis C, those who are co-infected may be at a higher risk of atherosclerosis and CVD. Therefore, we investi\u00ad gated the association between hepatitis C and CVD in a cohort of individuals with HIV infection and substance abuse. Methods We analysed baseline data collected from 395 HIV\u00ad infected participants in the HIV-Longitudinal Inter\u00ad relationships of Viruses and Ethanol (HIV - LIVE) study, a prospective cohort ofindividuals with HIV infection and current or past alcohol problems. During August 2001 to July 2003, 400 HIV- LIVE participants were enrolled from four different sources: (i)a previous cohort ofHIV\u00ad infected participants with alcohol problems; (ii) Boston Medical Center's Diagnostic Evaluation Unit, an intake clinic for HIV-infected patients; (iii) Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center primary care and specialty clinics; and (iv) other local healthcare sites or shelters in the Boston area. Inclusion criteria included: (i) an HIV antibody test positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by Western blot; (ii) two or more affirmative responses to the CAGE alcohol screening questionnaire [17] or by physician-investigator diagnosis ofalcoholism; (iii)ability to speakEnglish orSpanish; and (iv) at least one contact person who was likely to know the subject's whereabouts. Participants were excluded if the 30-item Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination score [18] was less than 21 or a trained interviewer assessedthat the patient was incapable ofcomprehending the informed consent or of answering interview questions. For the present cross-sectional analysis, five participants were excluded because ofmissing hepatitis C RNA data (n=4) or a history of CVD data (n= 1). Additional study design details have been published elsewhere [19]. The Institutional Review Boards of the Boston Medical Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and the University of Pittsburgh approved the study. The primary outcome variable was self-reported CVD. CVD was defmed as a 'yes' response to one of the three following questions: 'Has a doctor ever told you that you had...' (1) peripheral vascular disease (hardening of the arteries in your neck or legs, atherosclerosis); (2) a stroke, cerebrovascular accident, blood clot or bleeding in the brain, or transient ischemic attack; or (3) a heart attack (myocardial infarction). Our secondary outcome was myocardial infarction. Hepatitis C infection, defmed as detectable hepatitis C viral RNA (either from serum collected at the time of enrollment or from participants' medical records), was the main independent variable. Additional co-variates included the following: age; race (white versus non-white); sex; current CD4 cell count (>200cells/~I); obesity (body mass index ;:::30kg/m2) ; current adherent antiretroviral therapy use defined as 100% adherence to all antiretroviral medications over the preceding 3 days before enrollment in the study; and self-reported health conditions defmed as a 'yes' response to 'Has a doctor ever told you that you had .. .' diabetes or high blood sugar or sugar, hypertension or high blood pressure, high cholesterol, renal disease (poor kidney fimction or blood tests showing high creatinine), anemia (low red blood cell count, hemoglobin), or cirrhosis of the liver. For substance use variables, we defined current smoking as a 'yes' response to 'Do you currently smoke cigarettes every day or on some days?'; current at-risk alcohol consumption as drinking more than 14 standard drinks for men (more than seven for women) per week or more than four drinks on one occasion for men (more than three drinks for women) in the past 30 days; cocaine use as self-reported use of 'cocaine, crack or free base'; and injection as a 'yes' response to 'In your lifetime, have you ever injected drugs?'. Homelessness was defined as any night on the street or in a shelter in the past 6 months. We defined lipodystrophy as a 'yes' response to 'Since you began taking HIV medications, have you noticed any of the following changes: more fat in the back of your neck or increase in your waist, \"butt' or chest out ofproportion to your arms or legs?' [20]. Statistical analyses We obtained descriptive statistics for all variables and assessed the relationship between hepatitis C and CVD and other co-variates using t-tests \u00a9 Williams &Wilkins.

The limited numberofself-reported CVD eventsprecluded models that adjusted for all covariates simultaneously. When hepatitis C-positive and hepatitis C-negative participants were missing data on body mass index (n = 10 and n = 9, respectively), CD4 cell count (n=9 and n= 13, respect\u00ad ively), HIV viral RNA (n= 16 and n = 20, respectively), and ahistoryoflipodystrophy (n=6 and n = 1, respectively) or when hepatitis C-negative participants were missing dataonahistoryofinjection drug use (n= 1)and currentat\u00ad risk alcohol consumption (n= 1), we excluded those participants from the analyses adjusted for those factors. As previous studies reported an association between hepatitis C and diabetes, we performed secondary analyses restricting the sample to those who reported no history of diabetes. Results Compared with the 197 HIV-infected participants who were not infected with hepatitis C, those with hepatitis C co-infection (n= 198) were significantly older (43.9 versus 40.9 years), had a higher prevalence of ever having had diabetes (10.1 versus 4.1%), cirrhosis (10.6 versus 2.5%), myocardial infarctions (6.5 versus 0.5%), and CVD (11.1 versus 2.5%), and a lower prevalence of hyperch\u00ad olesterolemia (19.7 versus 33.0%, P<0.05 for all; Table 1). The unadjusted OR for the prevalence of CVD and myocardial infarction were significantly higher among those with hepatitis C co-infection compared with those who were infected only with HIV [OR 4.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.78-12.95 and OR 13.77; 95% CI 1.78-106.33, respectively]. After adjusting for age, the association between hepatitis C and both CVD and myocardial infarction persisted (OR CI 1.65-100.33, respectively; Table 2).

In participants without diabetes, the association between hepatitis C and CVD was similar (OR 4.11; 95% CI 1.47 -11.49) to analyses that included participants with diabetes. Discussion In the HIV- LIVE cohort, those co-infected with hepatitis C and HIV had a higher unadjusted and age\u00ad adjusted prevalence of CVD than those who were infected with HIV alone. When individual confounders were added separately to the age-adjusted models, the relationship between hepatitis C and CVD remained unchanged. Analyses excluding participants with diabetes yielded similar results. Previous studies describing the relationship between hepatitis C and CVD among HIV-infected individuals are sparse and their results have been inconsistent. In the HIV Epidemiologic Research Study, hepatitis C antibody\u00ad positive women with HIV infection had higher rates of hospitalizations for CVD conditions compared with those only infected with HIV [21]. In contrast, among HIV/ hepatitis C co-infected participants of the HIV Out\u00ad patient Study, the age-adjusted prevalence of CVD was not significantly higher compared with those infected with HIV alone [22]. The association between HIV and hepatitis C co-infection and CVD, however, may have varied between the studies because the defmition ofCVD used was not the same. Among individuals infected with hepatitis C, but not HIY, our findings are consistent with previous studies reporting an increased prevalence ofcarotid atherosclero\u00ad sis [7-9] and prevalent CVD [10]. Whereas some studies reported no significant association between hepatitis C and atherosclerosis, those studies were limited by sparse data on substance abuse habits, particularly injection drug use [13], and no data describing the risks ofco-infection with HIVand hepatitis C, or analyses ofhepatitis C viral RNA data [11-13]. Data on hepatitis C viral RNA is valuable because it can reduce the misclassification that might occur as a result of the approximately 20% of hepatitis C antibody-positive individuals who spon\u00ad taneously clear the virus [23]. Given the association between hepatitis C infection and diabetes, it is possible that the effect of hepatitis C on cardiovascular risk might be mediated solely through diabetes [5]. However, our analyses, which adjusted for a history ofdiabetes and also restricted the sample to individuals without diabetes, suggest that diabetes is not the mechanism responsible for this association among HIV-infected individuals. Our study has several limitations that merit comment. First, the outcome variable and several covariates were obtained by self-report, which could have resulted in some non-differential misclassification, However, our self-reported variables that were traditional CVD risk factors (e.g. hypertension and cholesterol) were associated with an increased prevalence of self-reported CVD. Second, as our definition of lipodystrophy included fat accumulation in the buttock region, there is the possibility that some non-differential misclassification occurred because lipodystrophy among HIV-infected individuals typically results in fat loss, rather than accumulation in the buttock region. Third, it is possible that differential misclassification might have occurred among those infected with hepatitis C because they might have had more contact with the healthcare system and consequently had more opportunities to be told of other health conditions (e.g. CVD). However, this potential misclassification was probably minimized by the fact that all the participants had several important health problems (e.g. HIV and alcohol) requiring frequent use of the Copyright \u00a9 Lippincott Williams &Wilkins. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited. Hepatitis C, cardiovascular disease, and HIV Freiberg et al. 197 healthcare system. Furthermore, when hepatitis C might have resulted in additional clinic visits (e.g. hepatology clinic), this patient-physician encounter would probably not have focused on CVD issues. Fourth, as there were a small number of self-reported cardiovascular events, our ability to adjust for confounders in the multivariable models was limited. Finally, as all the participants in this cohort had alcohol problems, the findings may not be generalizable to the HIV-infected population without alcohol problems. Nevertheless, this study suggests that among HIV\u00ad infected individuals, co-infection with hepatitis C may be independently associated with an increased risk of CVD. This finding, if confirmed in other studies, has important implications for the prevention and treatment ofCVD for the substantial number of individuals around the world who are co-infected with HIVand hepatitis C.

For instance, in Kuhl and colleagues' study, one in eight women had ndings that demanded biopsy. These results would not be expected in the general population. Despite the high recall rates, 52% of biopsy specimens in Kuhl's study showed breast cancer, a gure that is also accepted in screening mammography. In MRI screening of high-risk patients, 12 MRI also doubled the recall rate but the rate of detected lesions per biopsy did not change\u2014one in three biopsies was positive for cancer. These ndings can only lead to the conclusion that MRI outperforms mammography in tumour detection and diagnosis. MRI should thus no longer be regarded as an adjunct to mammography but as a distinct method to detect breast cancer in its earliest stage. A large multicentre breast-screening trial with MRI in the general population is essential. *Carla Boetes, Ritse M Mann Radboud University of Radiology, 6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlandsc.boetes@rad.umcn.nl We declare that we have no confl ict of interest. Stroke prevention in elderly patients with atrial brillation Warfarin is highly e ective in the prevention of stroke in atrial brillation, with a 64% risk reduction compared with 22% for aspirin.1 However, there are concerns about whether this bene t can be extrapolated to older age- groups because few patients older than 75 years were enrolled in early clinical trials. Older patients are at the high-est risk of stroke, but old age has been identi ed as an inde- pen dent risk factor for warfarin-associated haemorrhage. In today's Lancet , Jonathan Mant and colleagues report the results of the Birmingham Atrial Fibrillation Treatment of the Aged (BAFTA) study, in which 973 patients, age 75 years and older and with atrial brillation, were randomised to warfarin (target international normalised ratio 23) or aspirin 75 mg. 2 The primary endpoint was fatal or disabling strokes (ischaemic and haemorrhagic) or clinically signi cant arterial embolism. Warfarin was superior to aspirin in the prevention of stroke (1\u00b78% vs 3\u00b78% per year) and was no more hazardous than aspirin in terms of major haemorrhage (1\u00b79% vs 2\u00b70% per year). To what extent can the BAFTA results be applied to a real-world population of elderly patients with atrial brillation? To answer this question, we must consider the possible infl uence that selection bias may have had in BAFTA. Once enrolled in BAFTA, warfarin-eligible patients had a 50% chance of receiving aspirin, which is less e ective than warfarin at preventing stroke. Because it would be unethical to deny warfarin to patients for whom it is clearly indicated, participation in BAFTA was restricted to patients for whom there was See Articles page 493 BAFTA2NRAF4SPORTIF III5SPORTIF V6AFI7ACTIVE-W8 Heart failure (%) 20 56 34 40 22 31 Hypertension (%) 53 56 72 81 46 82Mean age (years) 82 81 70 72 69 70 Diabetes (%) 14 23 22 25 15 21 Previous stroke (%) 13 25 24 18 17 15New to warfarin (%) 60 NA 27 15 100 22 NA=not applicable (observational study, no warfarin treatment).

From a physician's perspective, this eligi bility requirement probably encouraged the recruit-ment of patients at a lower risk of stroke. For example, recently revised guidelines recommend either aspirin or warfarin (depending on the individual physician's and patient's preference) for patients with a CHADS2 score of 1 (CHADS2 scores patients with atrial brillation to determine their risk of stroke. For a patient older than 75 years, this would mean he or she had no other stroke risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, history of stroke, or congestive heart failure). 3 Therefore, compared with other study populations, participants in BAFTA had a lower prevalence of risk factors for stroke (table). It is noteworthy that just over a fth of the 4639 patients identi ed were enrolled, and 1570 patients were excluded because warfarin was the only appropriate treatment for these patients. The low prevalence of risk factors for stroke might, in addition to good control of blood pressure and the large proportion of patients already taking a vitamin K antagonist at study entry, explain the lower than anticipated rate of thrombotic events in BAFTA. Nevertheless, the fact that BAFTA showed that warfarin is more e ective than aspirin, even in this relatively low-risk group of patients, adds to other evidence 8 that, in patients with atrial brillation, anticoagulation protects patients against stroke more e ectively than antiplatelet therapy. We agree with Mant and colleagues that the lack of di erence in major haemorrhage between the two groups is surprising. Additionally, the rates of haemorrhage in BAFTA were signi cantly lower than rates in another study of elderly patients treated with warfarin. 9 How might we explain these observations? First, just over four- fths of the patients in BAFTA were taking warfarin or aspirin before enrolment, which means that BAFTA selected a group of individuals who had already survived exposure to antithrombotic therapy. Second, we presume that combination ther-apy with an antiplatelet and a vitamin K antagonist (eg, clopidogrel and warfarin), a known independent risk factor for warfarin-asso ciated haemorrhage, was not permitted. Third, the number of potential patients initially invited for an electroencephalogram is not clear. Possibly, the individuals who responded to the invi tations to par ticipate represent an overall healthier population (ie, less likely to be recently discharged from hospital). Knowledge of the prevalence of risk factors for haemorrhage (including history of haemorrhage, renal disease, and anaemia) would allow a more informed interpretation of the bleeding rates. Despite these considerations, BAFTA adds important new information for the care of elderly patients with atrial brillation. Mant and colleagues enrolled an unprecedented number of patients in an age group that has been largely under-represented in randomised trials. BAFTA rmly establishes the superior e cacy of warfarin as a stroke-prevention strategy in elderly patients with atrial brillation. However, in the future, our greatest challenge will be to identify those patients (elderly or not) who are truly at the highest risk of major bleeding, particularly intracranial haemorrhage. For everyone else, no matter the age group, the bene ts of well-managed warfarin substantially out-weigh its risks. *David Garcia, Elaine Hylek Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131, USA (DG); and Department of Internal Medicine, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA (EH) davgarcia@salud.unm.edu DG and EH have received research funding from Bristol-Myers Squibb and acted as consultants for Bristol-Myers Squibb.

In the United States, nicotine dependence and unhealthy alcohol use are the first (18.1%) and third (3.5%) leading causes, respectively, of preventable deaths.1 Primary care physicians have not traditionally treated substanceuse despite the harmful effects that addiction can cause in their patients. The objective of this paper is to present recent evidence on recognizing and treating addiction disorders that is relevantfor generalist physicians. We conducted an electronic database (PubMed) search to systematically identify recent (January 1, 2003, to June 1, 2006), human subject, English language, peer-reviewed, research articles or publications that impact generalist care for patients with addiction disorders. The search strategy and consensus deliberations were used to identify importantarticles in the categories of screening strategies for patients with alcohol problems and use of specific pharmacotherapies for patients with alcohol, nicotine, and opioid dependence. Alcohol Disorders Anton RF, O 'Malley SS, Ciraulo DA, Couper D, Donovan DM, Gastfriend DR et al. Combined pharmacotherapies and behavioral interventions for alcohol dependence JAMA2006;295(17):2003 -2017Alcohol dependence affects approximately 8 million persons in the United States, contributing to substantial morbidity and mortality. 2-4To date, however, most evidence regarding prima- ry care interventions for unhealthy alcohol use has been inpatients with hazardous or \"at-risk \"drinkers, not alcohol- dependent individuals. 5 The Combined Pharmacotherapies and Behavioral Interven- tions (COMBINE) study was designed to test interventions foralcohol-dependent persons, and this trial included medica- tions and an intervention explicitly designed for nonspecialty settings, like primary care. 6,7In this 9-arm controlled trial, alcohol-dependent persons ( n=1,383) were assigned to combi- nations of the following: (a) a 9-visit primary care counseling intervention offered by medical professionals (typically nursesor physicians) termed Medical Management (MM), 8 arms; (b) daily oral naltrexone (an opioid receptor antagonist), (a putative glutamate modulator), 4arms; and (d) up to 20 formal counseling sessions from alcoholtreatment specialists termed the Combined Behavioral Inter- vention (CBI), 5 arms. 8,9Participants were required to be abstinent for 4 to 21 days prior to entry, and candidates wereexcluded if they had drug abuse or psychiatric disorders requiring medication. Overall follow-up averaged 94% at the end of active treatment (16 weeks) and 82% at 1-year post-treatment (68 weeks), with no significant differences by trial arm. Investigators assessed multiple trial outcomes, including percent days abstinent and return to heavy drinking. Anoverall \"good clinical outcome \"was defined as abstinence or moderate drinking \u2014maximum of 11 (women) or 14 (men) drinks per week \u2014with no more than 2 days on which more than 3 drinks (women) or 4 drinks (men) were consumedduring the last 8 weeks of the 16-week trial period. The percentages of good clinical outcomes at the end of treatment were 58% for MM/placebo, 74% for naltrexone/MM,71% for CBI/MM, and 74% for naltrexone/CBI/MM. The odds ratios for good outcomes were significantly increased for the combination therapy groups compared with MM/placeboalone (all p<0.01). Relative to persons who received placeboJGIM Received July 31, 2006 Revised October 9, 2006 Accepted January 16, 2007 Published online May 10, 2007 1190with medical management, the number needed to treat (NNT) to assure 1 additional good clinical outcome was 7 for CBI/ MM, 6 for naltrexone/MM, and 7 for naltrexone/CBI/MM. Oneyear after treatment, trial arm differences still favored the combination therapy groups, but results were no longer significant. The percentage of days abstinent (59 -69%) remained higher than at baseline (24 -25%). Interpreting the trial arm comparisons was hindered by the complex study design. Broadly, this study showed that naltrexoneand/or CBI in combination with MM were helpful treatments foralcohol dependent patients compared to MM alone. The applica- bility of COMBINE 's findings in contemporary primary care practice remains unclear. While MM was explicitly designed tobe offered by clinicians who are not addiction medicine specia- lists, the time required for the intervention (9 sessions, ranging from 20 -45 minutes in length) and the currently available training materials (a 141-page manual) would seem difficult to incorporate in primary care practice. 6 A separate finding in COMBINE highlights a more general challenge to the study of addiction treatment interventions. Consistent with recent trials on pharmaceutical interventions for alcohol problems, all trial arms achieved alcohol reductionsexceeding the differences between trial arms. 10-12Improve- ments independent of treatment assignment reflect the domi- nant impact of the contextual and motivational factors that propel patients to seek treatment and/or reduce drinking inthe absence of treatment. 12Primary care physicians may learn of such clinically important factors in the course of care. How and whether physicians should seek to assist patient recoveryprocesses in light of these factors may prove difficult to study in the context of randomized controlled trials. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism . Helping patients who drink too much: a clinician 's guide. U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Rockville, MD. 2005. For patients who are not alco hol-dependent, evidence supports screening and counseling to reduce misuse inprimary care settings, yet this recommendation is sporadicallyfollowed in everyday practice. 13,14For this reason, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) recently issued revised guidelines designed to simplify integration ofscreening and intervention into primary care. 15The guide contains evidence and consensus-based recommendations and its chief innovation is a simplified alcohol use screeningalgorithm. Persons who respond positively to a prescreening question (e.g., \"Do you sometimes drink alcoholic beverages? \") can be asked the following single question: \"How many times in the past year have you had (>5 for men, >4 for women)drinks in a day? \"This single-question approach, positive when any such episodes are reported in the prior 12 months, has reasonable sensitivity and specificity for detecting alcoholmisuse. 16Several investigators have examined single-item screening strategies.17-21For example, Taj found that a single question had a positive predictive value of 74% [95% confi-dence interval (CI), 66% to 83%], 88% (95% CI, 80% to 94%), sensitivity of 62%, and specificity of 93% in detecting problem drinking. 21Further research is warranted regarding the specific screening question from the Clinician 's Guide, although the single question it recommends is similar to those previously studied. When responses to thescreening questions are negative, only brief advice regarding safe use and annual rescreening are warranted. When positive, questions to distinguish at-risk use from abuse (interferingwith the patient 's life) or dependence (associated with toler- ance, withdrawal, or preoccupation) are indicated. The guide outlines and provides scripts for brief advice and assistance that clinicians can tailor to the patient 'sd e g r e eo f alcohol use and motivation to change. Additional resources review the alcohol contents of standard drinks, more formal screeninginstruments, and referral options, as well as an abbreviated guideto pharmacologic treatment of alcohol dependence. Nicotine Dependence Critchley J, Capewell S. Smoking cessation for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2004;(1):CD003041. Despite a reduction in prevalence, smoking accounts for over 435,000 deaths annually.22,23Smoking is a well-known risk factor for developing coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the magnitude of the impact of smoking cessationin reducing overall and cardiovascular mortality in patients with CAD is not well known. To estimate the magnitude of risk reduction when a patient with CAD stops smoking, investigators conducted a systematicreview and meta-analysis. 24The authors searched for studies in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, Cochrane Controlled Trial Register, CINAHL, PsychLit, and DissertationAbstracts through April 2003. In addition, searches were conducted of relevant conference proceedings, the UK National Research Register, references from retrieved articles, andexperts in the field, and contact was made with the investiga- tors from 61 cohort studies of cardiovascular risk. Finally, the authors attempted to identify any randomized clinical trialsthat collected but had not reported appropriate data. Because widely accepted standards for assessing quality in observational research are lacking, the authors included thosearticles that had a minimum of 2-years follow-up (consideredadequate time for smoking cessation to reduce risk) and employed 2 independent reviewers who assessed other aspects of quality (e.g., control of confounding, sample size, selectionbiases, operational definitions of smoking, smoking cessation, and index events). 25,26 The 20 prospective cohort studies that were identified followed 12,603 patients with CAD (myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina) for at least 2 years, conducted at least 2 assessments of smoking status, and provided cardio-vascular outcomes and all-cause mortality. Eight studiesincluded more than 500 subjects, predominantly males. While most studies had operational definitions of index cardiac events, few had biologic confirmation of smoking status. Sixstudies were assessed to have good control of confounding, whereas 9 had poor control. Losses to follow up were reported to be relatively small, although few studies were able tocapture losses that occurred between the index cardiac event and study enrolment. The authors conducted a metaregression to help adjust for study heterogeneity; predictor variables included control of confounding variables, minimization of selection biases, and operational definitions for smoking status, smoking cessation,1191 Gordon et al.: Update in Addiction Medicine JGIMand outcome events. Among those who quit smoking, the relative risk (RR) of mortality was reduced 36% compared with those who continued to smoke [1,044/5,659 vs 1,884/6,944;crude RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.71]. While these results were dominated by 3 large studies that included patients with bypass Surgery, the results did not differ significantly when limited totrials of patients who were enr olled following myocardial addition, the myocardial infarct- ions was reduced by 32% for those quit smoking (263/2,467 vs 516/3,662; crude RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.82). Theauthors conducted a sensitivity analysis of those studies that had an initial sample size of at least 500 smokers at baseline, at least 85% follow-up, and adequate or good control of confound-ing. The main findings were similar in these 6 studies. The risk reduction associated with quitting smoking was similar across index cardiac events, age, sex, country, and time period. These findings highlight the benefit of smoking cessation for patients with CAD. The 36% risk reduction in all-cause mortality is similar to benefits seen with treating hypercho-lesterolemia and hypertension. 27-30While these findings were not demonstrated in randomized trials, the authors attempted to reduce bias in this meta-analysis by creatingrigorous eligibility criteria for the studies, and conducting asensitivity analysis using the highest quality studies. How- ever, there are still potential limitations to the generalizabil- ity of the meta-analysis. First, patients who cease smokingfollowing a cardiac event may differ from those who do not. Unmeasured confounders could account for the mortality benefit seen in patients who quit smoking. Secondly, be-cause most studies relied on subject self-report, it is possible that studies were not able to accurately classify the subject 's smoking status at follow-up. Nonetheless, the high preva-lence of nicotine dependence among patients with CAD, theimpact of smoking cessation on mortality, and the effective- ness of smoking cessation interventions all support clinician efforts to aggressively treat nicotine dependence in patientswith known CAD. Physicians should address smoking cessation using guideline-consistent strategies in all patients who smoke and consider the added benefit in those patientswith established CAD, especially those who appear motivated following a significant cardiac event. 31 Gonzales D, Rennard SI, Nides M, Oncken C, Azoulay S, varenicline, nicotinic acetylcholine -63. Buproprion and nicotine replacement therapies are the mainstay of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. Previousresearch has shown that current smoking cessation treat- ments are not widely disseminated to the general population of smokers. 32A new agent, varenicline, is an 42 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist that stimulates the release of dopamine to reduce craving and withdrawal, whilesimultaneously blocking nicotine 's reinforcing effects. Two industry-funded, randomized, double-blinded trials evaluated varenicline against bupropion SR and placebo in adults whowere motivated to stop smoking. 33,34Randomization was stratified by center. In the first trial, the 1,025 subjects who met inclusion criteria (age 18 -75, smoked >10 cigarettes per day, had <3 months of smoking abstinence in the past year, and were motivated to quit) received varenicline, 0.5 mg/day for days 1 -3, 0.5 mg twice per day for days 4 -7, then 1 mg twice per day through week 12 ( n=352), or SR bupropion 50 mg/day for days 1 -3, then 150 mg twice per day through week 12 ( n=329), or placebo ( n=344). The second trial26had a similar design and enrolled 1,027 subjects. The primary endpoint for both trials was continuous abstinence for the final 4 weeks of treatment, defined as the proportion of participants who reported no smoking or use ofany nicotine-containing products, confirmed by exhaled car- bon monoxide. Secondary endpoints included continuous abstinence rates from week 9 through week 24 and throughweek 52. The 52-week study completion rates in the first study were 60.5% for varenicline, 56% for bupropion SR, and varenicline, 65% for bupropion SR,and 60% for placebo in the second study. In the first trial, the investigators found that subjects receiving varenicline (44.0%) were most likely to achieve the primary abstinence endpoint compared with placebo sub-jects Subjects also more likely to achieve second-ary abstinence endpoints compared with placebo subjects (10.5%, at 24-week follow-up. However, was superior only to placebo (21.9 vs 8.4%,p<0.001, NNT, 7.4) for the primary endpoint at 52 weeks and not to SR buproprion (16.1%, p=0.06). In the second study, varenicline was bupropion at 52-week follow-up(30.5 vs 23.4%, p=0.05, NNT, 14.1). Minor adverse events, including nausea and abnormal dreams, were more common in the varenicline group in both trials, but did not cause patientsto discontinue therapy. Because these were the first published trials of varenicline 's efficacy for quitting smoking, important questions remainunanswered about how effective varenicline will be in routine clinical practice. These 2 studies were also not designed primarily to test varenicline 's efficacy for maintenance of abstinence, although other studies have addressed this ques-tion, using higher varenicline doses. 35Finally, it is currently unknown whether nicotine replacement therapy will be effec- tive when used with varenicline, whether postmarketingsurveillance will reveal rare but serious complications, whether there will be important drug interactions with varenicline, or whether insurance plans will cover varenicline. Opioid Dependence Turner BJ, Laine C, Lin YT, Lynch K. Barriers and facilitators to primary care or human immunodeficiency virus clinics providing methadone or buprenorphine for the managementof opioid dependence. Arch Intern Med 2005;165(15):1769 - 1776.1192 Gordon et al.: Update in Addiction Medicine JGIMDependence upon heroin and prescription opioid analgesics is an important public health problem.2,36-38Historically, effective treatment for opioid dependence has been limited tomethadone provided in specialty substance abuse programs. The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 and the approval of buprenorphine in 2002 have, for the first time, allowedphysicians to prescribe medication for the treatment of opioid dependence in primary care settings. This study examined factors associated with interest in delivering buprenorphine and methadone treatment by prima-ry care and HIV specialty clinics. 39In a survey of 261 clinics that serve Medicaid patients, 41% of which provided HIV care, medical directors were questioned about knowledge andattitudes towards opioid dependence treatment, and potential facilitators and barriers to providing this treatment. Analyses compared willingness to provide buprenorphine versus meth-adone and examined the associations of clinic characteristics and attitudes with interest in offering these treatments. Clinics were more interested in providing buprenorphine than meth-adone (60 vs 33% p<0.001), partly because of the perceived lower abuse potential and stigma. Nearly half of respondents had at least 1 negative opinion about patients with opioiddependence. Interest in providing buprenorphine was greaterin clinics offering HIV services, treating more patients with chronic pain, or those affiliated with methadone programs. Fifty-seven percent of medical directors reported a high level ofconcern about adequate reimbursement for treating opioid dependency. Greater than 60% cited the availability of Con- tinuing Medical Education credits and telephone access toaddiction medicine expertise as important in enhancing their interest in providing this care. This study highlights important barriers to adopting bupre- norphine treatment in primary care and HIV specialty prac-tices. Information concerning methadone is less relevant given the continued regulatory barriers to providing this treatment outside methadone clinics. The stigma of opioid dependenceand its treatment remains a major obstacle to disseminating medication-assisted treatment in medical clinics, although perhaps less so for buprenorphine. Access to substanceabuse treatment continues t o present major challenges, especially for patients relying on public funding mechanisms that separate medical and specialty addiction treatmentservices. HIV clinics appear to be appropriate sites for developing buprenorphine programs ( http://www.bhives. org). Access to physicians with experience treating opioid dependence ( http://www.pcssmentor.org ) may be an impor- tant factor in the willingness of physicians and clinics to provide office-based treatment. Mainstreaming Addiction Care Into Practice Institute of Medicine . Improving the quality of healthcare for mental and substance-use co nditions: the quality chasm series. The National Academies Press, Washington, D.C. 2005. The move to address patients 'alcohol and drug use by generalist physicians should be advanced by the current atten- tion to improving the quality of medical care. A recently published Institute of Medicine (IOM) report developed an agenda forchange of the health care system 's approach to the treatment and prevention of these conditions. 40The IOM 'su n d e r l y i n gtheme is that only by addressing substance use and mental health problems can patients achieve optimal benefit. The IOM report advocates coordinated care among primary care, mental health, and substance-use treatment providers. Specifically, coordination models can be straightforward (i.e., formal agreements among mental, substance-use, and prima-ry health care providers) to incrementally more complex arrangements (i.e., case management among systems, co- location of services, to clinically integrated practices). 40Evi- dence suggests that the more complex arrangements havestronger evidence for yielding improved patient outcomes. Other recommendations addressed to all clinicians including primary care physicians include the need to screen all mentalhealth patients for alcohol and drug use problems given the high comorbidity of these conditions. The report also stressed maintaining a patient-centered approach to the care ofindividuals with alcohol and drug problems. That means providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values, and ensuring thatpatient values guide clinical decisions. 41The increasing atten- tion to the impact of substance use disorders on patients ' medical outcomes should drive efforts to engage generalists inidentifying and treating these disorders.

Ongoing substance use is a potential confounder for immunological studies on hepatitis C virus (HCV), but there is little in the literature regarding the effects of injection drug use (IDU) or alcohol on HCV- specic immune responses. We wanted to determine whether IDU or alcohol affected immune responses in HCV- infected and human immunodeciency virus (HIV)/HCV coinfected subjects. Methods. Eight-four subjects with HIV/HCV and 57 with HCV were classied as either injection drug users, drinkers, or nonusers based on questionnaire results. Immune responses were studied with enzyme-linked im-munosorbent spot assay for interferon (IFN)- g, interleukin (IL)-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- aagainst HCV proteins Core, NS3, and NS5 and recall Results. Subjects with had signicantly than subjects drug users had HCV-specic IFN- gand IL-10 responses that were similar to those of HCV injection drug users and were signicantly higher than in nonusers with HIV/HCV . Conversely, subjects who drank alcohol had similar immune responses to those who were abstinent, amongboth subjects with HIV/HCV and subjects with HCV . Conclusions. Studies that examine IFN- gor IL-10 immune responses in HIV/HCV-coinfected or HCV-infected persons need to consider current IDU. Alcohol, at levels consumed in this cohort, does not appear to have asmuch of an effect on antigen-specic immune responses. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is not considered cytopathic in most cases, and the liver inflammation and pro-gressive brosis found in many patients with chronicviremia is believed to be due to an ongoing, ineffectualhost immune response to persistent infection.

Many persons with HIV/HCV coinfection acquired both infections via parenteral injection drug use (IDU),and ongoing polysubstance abuse is common with HIV/HCV coinfection and heavy alcoholconsumption ( 150 g/day) at risk of severe liver brosis [4, 5]. Alcohol modies cellular and humoralimmune responses in cell culture models as well asanimal models; studies show an increase in tumor ne-crosis factor (TNF)- aproduction or a shift from a type 1 (interferon [IFN]- gand interleukin [IL]-2) to a type 2 (IL-4 and IL-10) immune response in the presenceof alcohol [6-10]. However, little has been reported onthe effect of alcohol on HCV-specic cellular immune at Boston University Libraries on August 8, 2011 jid.oxfordjournals.org Downloaded from 848 JID 2007:195 (15 March) Graham et al.responses in humans or about potential immune mechanisms by which alcohol modies the disease course of HCV-relatedliver damage. Similarly, in animal models, chronic morphine treatment leads to decreased IFN-g and IL-2 and increased IL-4 and IL- 5, which appears to be mediated by increasing GATA 3 ex-pression and decreasing T-bet expression, thus shifting T helpercells to a type 2 phenotype [11]. The opioid antagonist, nal-oxone, can counteract productionand increase IFN- gand IL-2 production [12]. These data consistent with an endogenous role of opioids in inhibitingexcessive inflammatory responses with injury or other pain-inducing processes by augmenting anti-inflammatory type 2responses and limiting proinflammatory type 1 responses [13,14]. However, the effect of opiates on antigen-specic immuneresponses in humans with chronic HCV infection has not beenstudied. It is important to understand how substance abuse affects antigen-specic immune responses because these immune re-sponses may affect HCV-related liver disease outcomes. Forexample, early after acute HCV infection, it has been shownthat persons who develop chronic HCV infection but maintainHCV-specic IFN- gresponses have a slower progression of liver brosis [15]. We have shown that persons with HIV/HCVcoinfection who have higher HCV and Candida -specic IFN- gimmune responses are signicantly more likely to have lower inflammation and brosis scores on liver biopsy [16]. Our long-term goal has been to dene the immunological alterations in cellular immune responses to HCV that mayimpact on liver disease progression. However, because manyof our subjects with HIV/HCV have a history of IDU, we soughtto determine whether current substance abuse affects the resultsof our standard immunologic assays. Therefore, this study wasdesigned to determine whether current IDU or any alcoholexposure was associated with alterations in HCV-specic im-mune responses and, if so, whether the effects were the samein HCV-infected and HIV/HCV-coinfected subjects. We ex-amined HCV-specic and recall antigen responses in subjectswho consumed alcohol or were active injection drug users andwho were HCV-infected or HIV/HCV-coinfected, comparedwith responses in subjects who did not use injection drugs orconsume alcohol, to determine the relative impact of HIV statusand alcohol or injection drug exposure on cellular immuneresponses. SUBJECTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS Subjects. Subjects were recruited from the Boston Medical Center Hepatitis C, HIV , and Related Morbidity (CHARM) cohort, a prospective natural history cohort that includes dem-ographics, alcohol and drug use histories, clinical and labora-tory information, and collection of peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMCs) every 12 months. All subjects who were HCV-antibody positive by ELISA and had detectable HCV RNA completed a questionnaire regarding drug and alcohol use. Those who had PBMCs collected simultaneously for immune assays were included in the cohort from which subjects for this study were selected. Injection drug users were dened as sub-jects who had injected heroin in the last month before collection of PBMCs and denied any alcohol use in the past year. Drinkers were dened as subjects who had consumed any alcoholic bev- erages in the last month and denied any IDU in the past year. Subjects who both drank alcohol and were injection drug users were excluded. All subjects completed the Alcohol Use Dis- orders Identication T est (AUDIT) questionnaire, and subjects with scores /H110918 were considered to have hazardous drinking [17, 18]. We also used the alcohol consumption ranges in AU- DIT to dene \"heavy drinkers\" as subjects who consumed 3 or more drinks 4 or more times a week or at least 6 drinks in one sitting. \"Nonusers\" were dened as subjects who denied alcohol consumption and IDU for at least 1 year; for the present analysis, a subgroup of nonusers were randomly selected and matched by HIV status to the drinker cohort (the larger subject group). This study was reviewed and approved by the Insti- tutional Review Board of Boston University Medical Center and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, human experimen- tation guidelines of the respective institutions were followed in the conduct of this research, and all subjects provided written, informed consent. Recombinant HCV proteins. The recombinant HCV pro- teins used were derived from HCV genotype 1b and included Core protein (aa 1-115) and (NS) proteins NS3 (aa concentration of in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated overnight at 4/H11034 C. Ex- cess antibody was removed, and wells were blocked with com-plete media (RPMI 1640 PBMCs were 52.5/H1100310 cultured for 40 h in the presence of the recombinant HCVproteins Core, NS3, and NS5 at 1 mg/mL. Positive control wells consisted of phytohemaglutinin (5 mg/mL; Sigma), Candida cellular antigen (20 mg/mL; Greer Labs), and tetanus toxoid (5 mg/mL; Accurate Chemicals). Negative control wells were media alone and buffer (used to prepare HCV antigens; Mikrogen).After 40 h, plates were washed with PBS followed by PBS con- taining 0.05% Tween20.

After rinsing, 100 mg/mL avidin- peroxidase (1:7.5 ratio; ABC Kit; Vector Labs) was added for 30 min. After washing, 100 mL of substrate (3/prime,9/primeaminoethyl- carbazole [Sigma] H 2O2) was added and incubated until the appearance of red-brown spots, and thenrinsed with tap water. The numbers of spots per well werescored using an Automated ELISpot Reader System withKS4.5.21 software (Carl Zeiss). Averaged numbers of spot-forming cells in control wells were subtracted from antigen-stimulated wells to correct for spontaneous cytokine produc-tion. Persons performing the ELISPOT assays were blinded toall subject data except unique patient identication numbersand dates of sample collection. Statistical methods. Data were analyzed in SAS (version 8.2; SAS Institute) using the Mann-Whitney Utest and Fisher's exact test. Crude versus stratied odds ratios were comparedto determine whether immune response effects were con-founded by CD4 +T cell count or HIV virological control RNA !400 copies/mL) among subjects with HIV/HCV coin- fection or estimated duration of HCV infection for all subjects.T o determine the likelihood of having an immune response,continuous immune response values were converted to di-chotomous \"responder\" and \"nonresponder\" variables. We de-termined the cutoff value for responders to be /H1109110 sfc/10 6 PBMCs based on responses in 9 healthy controls to HCV pro-teins Core, NS3, and NS5 and recall antigens and by deter-mining the bimodal break point between lower frequency andhigher frequency responses in subjects for each antigen andcytokine combination and averaging (data not shown). Thiscutoff value was determined before any comparative analyseswere performed. All tests were 2-tailed and evaluated at a sig-nicance level of . P/H11088.05 RESULTS Subject characteristics. In total, we examined 84 subjects with HIV/HCV and 57 subjects with HCV alone. There were no signicant differences in age, sex, and race/ethnicity betweenthe HIV/HCV and HCV groups (data not shown). We thenexamined the cohort by substance use status. In total, we stud-ied 35 injection drug users (16 with HIV/HCV and 19 withHCV), 53 drinkers (34 with HIV/HCV and 19 with HCV), and53 nonusers (34 with HIV/HCV and 19 with HCV). Thesesubstance use-dened groups were also well balanced for age,sex, and race/ethnicity with no signicant differences betweengroups (data not shown). Ninety-four percent of the IDU groupinjected heroin 5 or more times per week. Forty-six percent ofdrinkers in this cohort had an AUDIT score /H110918, indicating hazardous drinking (15/34 subjects with HIV/HCV and 10/19subjects with HCV). Eight subjects with HIV/HCV and 5 sub- jects with HCV were further classied as heavy drinkers. Table 1 compares demographic characteristics between sub- jects with HIV/HCV and HCV within the IDU, drinkers, and nonusers groups. The HIV/HCV IDU group had signicantly lower CD4 +T cell counts than HIV/HCV nonusers group, but there were no other signicant differences between the HIV/ HCV IDU or drinkers groups and the HIV/HCV nonusers group. Because CD4+T cell counts are not routinely measured in persons with HCV alone, these data were not available. Be-cause HCV genotype and viral load are typically measured in persons under consideration for treatment of HCV infection and because active substance use is considered a contraindi- cation for treatment, many subjects in this cohort were miss- ing these data. Thus, those HCV-related factors could not be examined. Cellular immune responses. Unlike the relatively high-fre- quency T cell responses observed in chronic HIV infection, most studies of HCV-specic responses in persons with HIV/ HCV coinfection observe very low-frequency responses that may not be signicantly lower than those observed in subjects with HCV alone [19-24]. The HCV proteins used for our ELI-SPOT CD4 +T cells (based on de- pletion studies; data not shown). In gure 1, all subjects with HIV/HCV were compared with all subjects with HCV alone (irrespective of substance use status). IFN- gimmune responses to HCV proteins Core and NS5, summed HCV proteins (the sum of responses to HCV proteins Core, NS3, and NS5), Can- dida, and tetanus were signicantly higher in HCV subjects, compared with HIV/HCV subjects. In contrast, there were no signicant differences in IL-10 secretion between subjects with HCV and Subjects with HCV hadsignicantly higher TNF- and NS5 than HIV/HCV , whereas there were no signicant dif- ferences antigens were examined. In summary, IFN- gresponses were low in both HIV/HCV and HCV groups, although statistically higher in the HCV-alone group. Of interest, HCV-specic TNF-a responses were also higher in HCV monoinfection. Next, we compared antigen-specic immune responses in all subjects with IDU (the HIV/HCV and HCV groups combined) and all drinkers to all nonusers to determine whether therewere any overall effects of IDU or alcohol on immune responses (table 2). The IDU group had broadly higher IL-10 responses to both HCV proteins and Candida as well as numerically higher TNF- aresponses (HCV NS5-4 and Candida responses were signicantly higher), compared with nonusers. In contrast, drinkers had only higher IL-10 responses to NS5 and Candida, compared with nonusers. We then determined whether the immune response differ- ences seen in subjects with HIV/HCV versus subjects with HCV at Boston University Libraries on August 8, 2011 jid.oxfordjournals.org Downloaded from 850 JID 2007:195 (15 March) Graham et al.Table 1.

As shown in gure 2, the HIV/HCV IDU group had signicantly higherIFN-gsecretion to summed HCV proteins the HIV/HCV nonusers group, whereas the HCV-specic IFN- gresponses were not different between the HIV/HCV IDU and HCV IDUgroups.

When we examined IL-10 responses, we found that the HIV/ HCV IDU group had signicantly group had similar tosummed HCV proteins, compared with the HCV nonusersgroup. contrast, HCV IDU group had secretion to Candida, compared with the HCV There were no signicant differences in TNF- asecretion to summed HCV proteins, whereas both the HIV/HCV non-users group and the HCV IDU group had signicantly higher TNF-a secretion to Candida than the HCV IDU group had signicantly lower CD4 +T cell counts than the HIV/HCV nonusers group, and it has beendescribed in the HIV literature that advanced immunosup- pression is associated with a shift to a type 2-like response [25]. T o evaluate whether the higher HCV-specic IL-10 responses in the HIV/HCV IDU group were actually a function of lowerCD4 +T cell counts as opposed to IDU, we examined the like- lihood of having an HCV-specic IL-10 response in subjects with CD4+T cell counts !359 cells/mm3(the median value for the HIV/HCV IDU and nonusers groups), compared with 1359 cells/mm3. The associations between HCV-specic IL-10 re- sponses in the HIV/HCV IDU group and the HIV/HCV non- users group were similar in low versus high CD4+T cell count strata; thus, these responses were more likely related to IDU than to the degree of immunosuppression (data not shown). Next, we examined the effect of exposure to alcohol on cel- lular immune responses in the group of drinkers compared with the same nonusers group to which we had compared theIDU group (gure 3). In contrast to ndings in gure 1, theHIV/HCV drinkers group had similar HCV-specic IFN- gre- sponses to the HCV drinkers group, whereas the HIV/HCVnonusers group had signicantly lower IFN- gresponses than the HCV nonusers group.

Injection drug users and drinkers were each compared with nonusers. IFN, interferon; IL, P!.01 other comparisons were not sig- nicantly different (data not shown). More subjects in the HIV/HCV drinkers group had HIV loads !400 copies/mL than in the HIV/HCV nonusers group. Stratied odds ratios were compared for the likelihood of hav-ing an HCV-specic or Candida immune response with IFN- or TNF- abetween the HIV/HCV drinkers and non- users load level (stratied by !400 copies/mL or1400 copies/mL). There was no increased likelihood of im- mune responses associated with being a drinker in the virolog-ically well-controlled group versus the detectable group; so,immunological responses were not a function of the degree ofHIV virological control (data not shown). Of note, estimatedduration of HCV infection was also not associated with im-mune responses for any group in this cohort (data not shown). In summary, the signicantly lower IFN- gHCV-specic re- sponses found when all subjects with HIV/HCV , in aggregate,were compared with all subjects with HCV seem driven by themuch lower responses found in the HIV/HCV nonusers group,because the HIV/HCV IDU group and the HIV/HCV had similar frequencies of cytokine secretion as the HCVIDU group and HCV drinkers Overall, IDUappeared to affect HCV-specic IFN- gand IL-10 responses more than alcohol exposure did in this cohort. DISCUSSION We have shown that the impact of HIV status on cellular im- mune responses differs by the cytokine response being tested.IFN-gsecretion was most affected by HIV status, with subjects with HIV/HCV having lower frequency responses for nearly allantigens tested than subjects with HCV alone. Most other stud- ies have not shown a signicant difference in HCV-specic IFN- gsecretion between HIV/HCV-infected and HCV-infected groups, although in these studies response frequencies were low in both groups, cohorts were smaller, and current substanceuse histories were not taken into account [20, 22-24]. Onestudy, using proteins and peptides to stimulate both CD4 +and CD8+T cells, also showed lower aggregate IFN-g T re- sponses in HIV/HCV-infected versus HCV-infected groups[19]. This nding is of interest because, in a different cohort,we have shown that persons with HIV/HCV coinfection who at Boston University Libraries on August 8, 2011 jid.oxfordjournals.org Downloaded from IDU or Alcohol and Immunity in HCV JID 2007:195 (15 March) 853 Figure 2.

Because many subjects in the present cohort wereactive substance users and did not have liver biopsies per-formed, we cannot perform a similar analysis for this study.However, we can speculate that the overall lower IFN- gre- sponses seen in HIV/HCV-coinfected subjects may be relatedto the accelerated brosis progression seen clinically [26]. Few studies have compared HCV-specic IL-10 responses in HIV/HCV-infected versus HCV-infected groups.

Statistical comparisons were made between the HIV/HCV drinkers group and the HIV/HCV nonusers group, the HIV/HCV drinkers group and the HCV drinkers group, the HCV drinkers group and the HCV nonusers group, and the that women with HIV/HCV had low but similar IL-10 responses to HCV and HIV antigens compared with se-cretion of IL-10 to HCV or recall antigens was not signicantlydifferent between the HIV/HCV-infected and HCV-infectedgroups. With overall depressed IFN-g responses, the HIV/HCV- coinfected subjects in this cohort have a relative shift to type2-like responses, as has been seen in other HIV cohorts withand without other coinfections [25, 27]. This immune state hasbeen associated with an increased rate of liver brosis pro- at Boston University Libraries on August 8, 2011 jid.oxfordjournals.org Downloaded from IDU or Alcohol and Immunity in HCV JID 2007:195 (15 March) 855gression in HCV/schistosomiasis coinfection and has been as- sociated with response to IFN-based treatment of HCV infection [15, 28] Based on previous animal models of the effect of opiates on immune responses, we had hypothesized that subjects who use infection drugs would have a shift to lower IFN- gand higher IL-10 responses than nonusers, regardless of HIV status. When we examined all injection drug users in aggregate, we did nd broadly higher IL-10 responses in injection drug users com- pared with nonusers. Unexpectedly, the subset of the IDU group had HIV/HCV non- users group, whereas comparable HCV-specic responses did not differ between the HCV IDU group and the HCV nonuser group. It is unknown how this pattern of cytokine production may affect progression of HCV-related liver disease, but this will be examined in more detail in future prospective studies. We had also hypothesized that drinkers, regardless of HIV status, would have lower IFN- gsecretion than nonusers because of data supporting a shift to a type 2-like immune response with alcohol exposure, although previous studies have not ex- amined HCV-specic cellular immune responses [10, 29, 30]. Surprisingly, in the present study, alcohol had little effect on antigen-specic IFN- g, IL-10, or TNF- aimmune responses when the HCV drinkers group was compared with the HCV nonusersgroup. In addition, drinkers with HIV/HCV had similar gresponses, with nonusers with HCV . Therefore, these data do not support a strong shift to type 2 cellularimmune responses in the presence of alcohol consumption. For this study, our aim was to determine whether usual pat- terns of alcohol consumption would affect our immune responseassays. In fact, we found few immune response differences be- tween drinkers and nonusers. However, a limitation of the pres- ent study is the lack of quantied daily measurements of alcohol consumption. Therefore, we cannot determine whether there is a threshold effect of alcohol consumption on immune responses. Approximately 25% of our subjects were considered heavy drink- ers based on categories of alcohol consumption, and there was a suggestion that, in this small group, there may be higher HCV-specic IL-10 and TNF- asecretion, at least for NS5. This ques- tion would need to be addressed in cohorts with higher rates of heavy alcohol use. In conclusion, antigen-specic IFN- gimmune responses are broadly diminished in persons with HIV/HCV coinfection, and HCV-specic TNF- aresponses are also weaker in with HIV/HCV , compared with subjects with HCV . This effect ismodied by IDU and, to a lesser extent, by alcohol consump-tion, for which we found a relative increase in immune re-sponses in substance users with HIV/HCV , compared with non-users with HIV/HCV . Because most studies examining cellular immune responses in HIV/HCV and HCV focus on IFN- gas the representative T cell effector function, these results suggestthat IDU may be a confounding variable in these analyses.Future studies should examine mechanisms of action of IDUon HCV-specic immune responses as well as the effects ofimmune response alterations on HCV-related liver disease.

To balance the benefits and risks of chronic antithrombotic prophylaxis, it is important to estimate the absolute risk of stroke for individual patients. Methods: Systematic review of studies using multivariate regression techniques to identify inde\u00ad pendent risk factors for stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation was conducted, and reports of absolute stroke rates in subgroups of patients with these risk factors collected. A summary esti\u00ad mate of the relative risk associated with each independent risk factor was calculated using maxi\u00ad mum likelihood methods. Results: Seven studies (including six entirely independent cohorts) were identified. Prior stroke/ TIA(relative risk 2.5, 95% CI1.S to 3.5), increasing age (relative risk 1.5 per decade, 95% Cll.3 to 1.7), a history of hypertension (relative risk 2.0, 95% Cl 1.6 to 2.5), and diabetes mellitus (relative risk 1.7,95% CllA to 2.0) were the strongest, most consistent independent risk fac\u00ad tors. Observed absolute stroke rates for nonanticoagulated patients with single independent risk factors were in the range of 6 to 9% per year for prior stroke/TIA, 1.5 to 3% per year for history of hypertension, 1.5 to 3% per year for age> 75, and 2.0 to 3.5% per year for diabetes. Female sex was inconsistently associated with stroke risk, whereas the evidence was inconclusive that either heart failure or coronary artery disease is independently predictive of stroke. Conclusions: Four clinical features (prior stroke/TIA, advancing age, hypertension, diabetes) are consistent independent risk factors for stroke in atrial fibrillation patients. Prior stroke/TIA is the most powerful risk factor and reliably confers a high stroke risk (>5% per year, averaging 10% per year). Absolute stroke rates associated with other individual risk factors are difficult to pre\u00ad cisely estimate from available data. Neurology\";' 2007;69:546-554 Supplemental data at www.neurology.org Among patients with atrial fibrillation, the absolute risk of stroke varies 20-fold depend\u00ad ing on patient age and other clinical features, Accurate risk stratification is critical when balancing the potential benefits and risks of chronic antithrombotic therapy to prevent stroke. We systematically review clinical studies that identified patient features indepen\u00ad dently associated with stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and summarize the abso\u00ad lute stroke rates associated with individual patient features. METHODS The primary aim was to identify independent risk factors for ischemic stroke in nonanricoagularcd patients with atrial fibrillation. We searched MEDLINE from January 1985 to October 2005 for all studies of patients with nonvalvu\u00ad lar atrial fibrillation that determined factors independently associated with stroke using rnultivar iarc regression techniques, The search strategy (appendix E-I on the Neurology Web sire [www.neurology.orgj) yielded 81 abstracts for initial consider\u00ad arion and was supplemented by personal files supplied by the members of the expert Working Group. Both prospective and retrospective studies were considered; studies in which >10% of the cohort received oral anticoagulants (c.g., oral vitamin K antagonists, xirnclagarran) and studies in which >10% of patients had mitral stenosis or prosthetic cardiac valves were excluded. Studies in which participants rook aspirin nr other anriplarelct agents were included.

Studies restricted to surrogate outcomes (e.g., left atrial thrombi at neuroimaging evidence of subclinical strokes) were nor considered. Analyses of independent cchocardiographic and hemato\u00ad logic predictors were included only if analyzed with clinical risk factors. Studies with fewer than 30 stroke outcome events were excluded hecause accurate characterization of the predictive strength of multiple Independent features would be weakened (i.e., potential for \"ovcrfitring\" of the models). Cohorts that were subsequently included in larger analyses were not considered individually (e.g., the Stroke Prevention in Atria] Fibrillation (SPAF) I trial' placebo par\u00ad ticipants were included as part of the subsequent Atrial fi\u00ad hrillation Investigators (AFI) 1994 pooled analysis)' with exceptions noted in the text and footnotes to the tahles, Ex\u00ad cluded studies and the reasons for exclusion are listed in ap\u00ad pendix E-I!. Variables included in the multivariate models for each study are given in appendix E-IIJ; for selected vari\u00ad ables (bearr failure, coronary artery disease), specific defini\u00ad tions are also provided when available. Reported measures of effect (i.e., risk ratio, hazard ratio, odds ratio [OR], rate ratio) differed across studies and are specified in appendix E-III; because these measures are very similar when the out\u00ad come is infrequent, the term \"relative risk\" is used through\u00ad out. When not provided, the 95% Cl for the relative risk was estimated using the Z statistic corresponding to the reported p value to estimate tbe variance. The prevalence of individual risk factors across studies was estimated by combining the prevalences in each study weighted by its number of participants. To obtain an overall estimate of the relative risk associated with each risk factor, a maximum likelihood estimate that weighted each study in\u00ad versely to its variance was computed after first testing for statistical homogeneity across studies assuming a fixed ef\u00ad fects model.' All reported relative risks from multivariate models were included in the computation regardless of the statistical significance. In the few cases in which a relative risk was reported as nonsignificant in the multivariate model and not reported, the reported univariate relative risk esti\u00ad mate and 95% CI were used instead. To minimize bias, an overall estimate of relative risk was nor computed for fea\u00ad rures that were not analyzed in or assessed by rbe majority of studies. Statistical significance was accepted at the 0.05 level, and analyses were done using SPSS 10.5 and Excel 2002 software. A second aim was to comprehensively assess absolute stroke rates In the absence of anticoagulation for subgroups of atrial fibrillation patients with differing clinical risk fac\u00ad rors. The clinical risk factors were taken from both the mul\u00ad tivariate analyses and additional variables used in nine stroke risk prediction schemes.\"!' published rates (and 95% CIs when available), the number of participants, mean follow-up interval, and the number of outcome events were recorded (estimated fnr some rates, as indicated in the ta\u00ad bles). Published stroke rates were not included when the number of outcome events and patient-years of exposure could not be determined unless a CI was also provided. Out\u00ad come rates from data sets that were subsequently included in larger analyses are nor reported individually (e.g., patients involved in the SPAF 1II derivation scheme' were all included in the larger SPAF aspirin analysis); with exceptions for overlapping cohorts noted in footnotes to the tables. RESULTS Seven studies meeting the above crite\u00ad ria were identified (table 1).

Prior stroke/Tl A, present in 0 to 14% (mean 7%) of the cohort participants, was the strongest independent risk factor for subsequent stroke and was significant in all five studies (involving four separate cohorts) in which it was evaluated. Stroke risk increased 2.5-fold (95% CI 1.8 to 3.5) in patients with prior stroke/TIA (table 2). Patient age was a consistent independent risk factor for stroke in each of the six studies in which it was assessed (mean ages ranged from 62 to 79 years in the cohorts), associated with an in\u00ad cremental increased risk of 1.5 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.7) per decade (table 2). Blood pressure variables were consistent stroke predictors in all studies. A history of hy\u00ad pertension was present in 42 to 53% (mean = 48%) of the cohorts and was an independent risk factor for stroke in five of five studies (relative risk 2.0, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.5) and systolic blood pressure in two others (table 2).

In a subgroup of the AFI pooled clinical trials cohort consisting of three trials with echocardiographic data, heart failure was independently associated with ischemic stroke (relative risk 1.7,95% CI 1.1 to 2.7, P = 0.03), but this association was no longer significant after echocardiographic evi\u00ad dence of left ventricular dysfunction was added to the model!' (appendix E-IV). The combination variable of recent (within 3 months) congestive heart failure or fractional shortening ::::;25 DIt, by M-mode echocardiography (together classified as \"abnormal left ventricular function\") was a sig\u00ad nificant independent risk factor in the SPAF III derivation analysis: but not in rhe larger SPAF aspirin cohort.' Moderate to severe left ventricu\u00ad lar systolic dysfunction assessed by two\u00ad dimensional echocardiography was a powerful independent predictor in placebo-treated patients in the AFI analysis of echocardiographic features (relative risk = 2.5, 95% CI 1.5 to 4.4).13 This was not confirmed by the SPAF aspirin analysis;' nor was reduced fractional shortening independently predictive of subsequent stroke in another study.\" In short, clinical heart failure was not a consistent independent predictor in atrial fibrilla\u00ad tion patients, and although one study found left ventricular systolic dysfunction by two\u00ad dimensional echocardiography to be strongly pre\u00ad dictive in placebo-treated patients, Ll this was not confirmed in another study in which patients re\u00ad ceived aspirin. \\ Female sex (22 to 54% of the study cohorts, mean =40%) was an independent significant pre\u00ad dictor of stroke in three studies involving entirely separate cohorts (range of individual relative risk 1.6 to 1.9),'\u00b711.16 but not in three others214,2J (table 2). In the SPAF aspirin cohort,' women over age 75 were at particularly high risk, but an age/sex interaction was not confirmed in another larger study.\" Coronary artery disease (mean frequency = 25%) was not independently predictive of stroke in any of the three separate patient cohorts in which it was assessed-\"\" (table 2), although vari\u00ad ably defined as prior myocardial angina without revascularization procedures (appendix E-III).

Absolute stroke rates associated with high-risk fea\u00ad tures. All previously published observed stroke rates associated with specific risk factors and their combinations are given in appendix E-V, Several caveats apply. These rates are not ad\u00ad justed for the influence of other concomitant risk factors. Quantitative pooling of rates from sev\u00ad eral studies may lead to misleading results due to varying prevalence of patients with prior stroke/ TIA and other independent risk factors. Some rates are based on participants in randomized trr\u00ad als, whereas others are from clinical cohorts, In addition, different frequencies of anti platelet therapy use and different outcome constellations (i.e., ischemic strokes only vs all strokes vs strokes plus systemic emboli vs strokes plus TIAs) intro\u00ad duce uncertainty. Some rates are based on small numbers of stroke events (e.g., the 5.9% per year stroke rate among diabetics in one report was based on three events among 29 patients).!\" Fi\u00ad nally, lowest absolute rates of stroke arose in the largest study in which stroke detection during follow-up was based on administrative databases.\":\" Stroke rates for patients with prior stroke/Tl A were consistently high in all reports, with an ag\u00ad gregate estimate of about 10% per year with aspi\u00ad rin therapy (appendix E-V). Several studies attempted to identify patients with atrial fibrilla\u00ad tion with prior stroke/TIA who had relatively low stroke risks5,IH.IS,16; Stroke rates were 5.9% per year in men without hypertension or diabetes.v\" Whereas the time interval from the most recent stroke/Tl A was inversely related to stroke rate, prior strokeiTIA occurring 1 to 3 years before study entry conferred high stroke ra res.' Patients with a history of hypertension had re\u00ad ported stroke rates ranging from 2.617 to 5.8% per year,\" but the latter analysis included nearly one\u00ad fourth of patients with prior stroke/TIA (appen\u00ad dix E-V). In one study of 612 otherwise low-risk patients with hypertension (age ::::;75, systolic blood pressure <160 mm Hg, no diabetes or prior stroke/TIA), the observed stroke rate was 2.6% per year.\" In a large outpatient-derived cohort with low frequencies of prior srroke/Tl A (4%) and diabetes (15'YD), the observed stroke rate was 2.6% (Cl 2.2 to 3.0) per year for those with hypertension .17 For patients without prior srroke/Tl A, stroke rates for those age >75 ranged from 3.2 '7 to 5,2%5 per year (appendix E-V). Among men age >75 without prior stroke/Tl A, two studies found relatively low stroke rates (2.816 and 3.2%5 per year), and for such patients without hypertension Neurology 69 August 7, 2007 Copyright \u00a9 by AAN Enterprises, Inc, Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited. 551 or diabetes, the stroke rate was 1.6% per year (95% CI 0.7 to 3.9%).5 In two studies of patients older than age 80 without other risk factors (in\u00ad cluding coronary artery disease), stroke rates were 1.510 and 3.0%2 per year, albeit based on rel\u00ad atively few events (appendix E-V). For those ages 79 with \"lone atrial fibrillation,\" the isch\u00ad emic stroke rate was 2.1 % per year (95% CI 0.8 to 5.6) among patients in the placebo or control arms of clinical trials.' Diabetic patients with atrial fibrillation had reported stroke rates ranging from 3.617 to 8.6%2 per year (appendix E-V).

The stroke rate among women with atrial E-V); in two studies of otherwise low-risk women under age 75, the stroke rates were 0.6% per year16 and 1.7% per year.!\" Stroke rates among those with coronary artery disease ranged from 2.917 to 8.2'Y0 2 per year, and patients with heart failure had stroke rates rang\u00ad ing from 3.517 to 6.8%' per year. The stroke rate associated with coronary artery disease and with heart failure in the absence of other risk factors could not be estimated from available data. DISCUSSION Prior stroke/TIA, hypertension, advancing age, and diabetes are consistent inde\u00ad pendent predictors of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Despite differences in the six cohorts (e.g., hospital based vs outpatients vs pooled clinical trial participants), there is overall consistency in the effects of these independent risk factors (table 2). Evidence is less robust for female sex. Although several studies have re\u00ad ported that diagnosed heart failure and/or left ventricular systolic dysfunction by echocardiog\u00ad raphy are risk factors for stroke in patients with atrial fibrilla tion, the overall evidence of an inde\u00ad pendent predictive effect is inconsistent. There is little compelling evidence supporting coronary heart disease as an independent effect predictor of stroke in atrial fibrillation patients. Of note, par\u00ad oxysmal (or intermittent) atrial fibrillation did not emerge as independently predictive of stroke in any of the four studies in which it was as\u00ad sessed.2,5,12,14 Varying frequencies of the use of an\u00ad tiplatelet drugs among studies did not appear to influence the results of multivariate analyses to identify independent predictors (e.g., aspirin was used in about 5% of patients in the AFI cohort? vs 100\u00b01<, of those in the SPAF aspirin cohort,' yet significant independent predictors were similar [table 2]). Prior srroke/Tl A is associated with high rates of stroke even in atrial fibrillation patients with\u00ad out other factors.l-\":\" Because prior stroke/TIA is a marker of an underlying pathophysiologic cause and not the cause per se, this observation implies that additional important factors contributing to stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation re\u00ad main to be elucidated. All patients with atrial fi\u00ad brillation with prior stroke/Tl A should be considered at high risk and treated with anticoag\u00ad ulation if it can be given safely. The absolute all\u00ad cause stroke risk reduction by adjusted-dose warfarin (about 6% per year) substantially ex\u00ad ceeds the incremental increase in major hemor\u00ad rhage (about 1.5% per year) based on pooled results of clinical trials.\" Taken individually, the remaining risk factors conferred stroke rates of 1.5 to 3.5% per year, but available data are limited. It is unlikely that a sin\u00ad gle rate adequately characterizes the magnitude of risk for ail patients with a given risk factor: The severity of hypertension and duration of diabetes, for example, probably influence the absolute stroke rates in patients with these disorders. The higher absolute stroke rates among very elderly patients with atrial fibrillation appear to be explained in part by the coexistence of other independent risk factors associated with age. Al\u00ad though it may be possible to identify relatively low-risk patients over age 75, the wide CIs around existing rate estimates warrant caution. Female sex has been associated with an in\u00ad creased risk of stroke in atrial fibrillation patients in additional studies that did not meet inclusion criteria for these analyses-': x,]O (appendix E-II). In one study, female sex lost its independent predic\u00ad tive effect on stroke risk when adjusted for sys\u00ad tolic blood pressure\"; this adjustment could not be done in one large recent study\" and was asso\u00ad ciated with an age interaction in another.' Full characterization of the independent contribution of female sex to stroke risk in atrial fibrillation patients requires additional study. Although the presence of heart failure would be expected to increase the risk of stroke in atrial fibrillation patients based on current pathophysi\u00ad ologic concepts, the available evidence does not provide support for this association (table 2). The clinical diagnosis of heart failure in elderly people with atrial fibrillation is particularly difficult, possibly resulting in misclassification and blunt\u00ad ing of the predictive power. Although cardiolo\u00ad gists were involved in the diagnosis of heart 552 Neurology 69 August 7, 2007 Copyright \u00a9 by AAN Enterprises. Inc.

Hypo\u00ad thetically, stringent diagnostic include echocardiographic evidence of left ven\u00ad tricular systolic impairment may be required;':\" The stroke rates in recent clinical trials 31-3 4ap\u00ad pear to be lower than in clinical trials completed 15 years ago.\" Better control of blood pressure may be contributing to lower stroke rates,\" as even modest blood pressure lowering appears to have a substantial impact on stroke risk in atrial fibrillation patientsY Whether absolute stroke rates in high-risk subgroups of atrial fibrillation patients are now lower than 10 to 15 years ago cannot be definitively addressed by examining the reported rates owing to confounding by uncertain combinations of risk factors, varying frequencies of the use of aspirin and other cardiovascular medications, and the potential play of chance. The most consistent independent risk factors for stroke emerging from these multivariate anal\u00ad yses (prior stroke/TIA, advancing age, hyperten\u00ad sion, and diabetes) are also risk factors for stroke among persons without atrial fibrillation and consequently do not specifically implicate a car\u00ad dioembolic mechanism for ischemic strokes. However, the absolute stroke rates associated wi th these risk factors are several times higher among patients with atrial fibrillation as com\u00ad pared with their effects in patients without atrial fibrillation. Hypertension is associated with stasis of flow and thrombus in the left atrial with cardioembolic strokes in atrial fibrilla\u00ad tion patients,J.5-37 Advancing age is independently associated with reduction of left atrial appendage flow velocities.F Diabetes hypothetically could be a predictor of noncardioembolic strokes that el\u00ad derly atrial fibrillation patients experience, sup\u00ad ported by a relatively smaller reduction in stroke in diabetic atrial fibrillation patients by warfarin in some studies,\" but not in others.\" Overall, the substantial reduction of ischemic strokes by anti\u00ad coagulation over aspirin in atrial fibrillation pa\u00ad tients with each of these risk factors17.lo differs from warfarin's lack of relative benefit in patients with noncardioembolic cerebrovascular disease \"?\" and lends indirect support to a cardioembolic etiology. Although these analyses summarize the best available evidence about independent risk factors for stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, it would be premature to alter or abandon existing risk stratification schemes before wide validation of modifications or of new schemes. Optimal identification of low-risk atrial fibriJlation pa\u00ad tients who may not benefit substantially from an\u00ad ticoagulation is the focus of ongoing analyses by the Stroke Risk in Atrial Fibrillation Working Group. In addition, it is worth emphasizing that clinical decisions regarding antithrombotic ther\u00ad apy for pa tients with atrial fibrillation should in\u00ad corporate other factors in addition to the estimated stroke risk, including bleeding risks if anticoagulated, the patient's ability to tolerate sustained therapy, access to high-quality antico\u00ad agulation monitoring, and patient-specific values and preferences.

The dist ribution of alcohol consumption is highly skewed, particularly in subjects with al cohol dependence. Methods: In this paper, we will consider the use of count models for outcomes in a randomized clinical trial setting. These includ e the Poisson, isson, d negative binomial. We compare the Type-I error rate of these methods in a series of simulation studies of a ra ndomized clinical trial, and apply the methods to the ASAP (Addressing the Spectr um of Alcohol Problems) trial. Results: Standard Poisson models provide a poor fi t for alcohol consumption data from our motivating example, and did not preserve Type-I error rates for the randomized group comparison when the true distribution was over-dispersed Pois son. For the ASAP trial, where the distribution of alcohol consumption featured extensive over-dispe rsion, there was little in dication of significant randomization group differences, except when the standard Poisson model was fit. Conclusion: As with any analysis, it is important to choose appropriate statistical models. In simulation studies and in the moti vating example, the standard Po isson was not robust when fit to over-dispersed count data, and did not main tain the appropriate Type-I error rate. To appropriately model alcohol cons umption, more flexible count models should be routinely employed. Background Count outcomes are common in randomized studies of alcohol treatment. Subjects may be queried about their daily consumption of alcohol, measured as a number ofdrinks over a recent period [1] (typically 30 days), andthese values are used to estimate average drinking per day.In this setting, estimating differences between treatment group and control group is of primary interest. A challenge in modeling consumption outcomes is to appropriately account for the distribution of drinking.These distributions are characterized by a large number ofzeros (abstinent subjects) along with a long right tailPublished: 15 February 2007 BMC Medical Research Methodology 2007, 7:9 doi:10.1186/1471-2288-7-9Received: 24 July 2006 Accepted: 15 February 2007 This article is available from: http ://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2288/7/9 \u00a9 2007 Horton et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

An extensive literature describes models for counts [2-8], and they have been commonly applied in economic analyses, traffic acci-dents, and health services utilization. Many routines arenow available in general purpose statistical software (e.g.Stata) [8]. A natural model for counts is the single-param-eter Poisson distribution. One disadvantage of the Pois- son is that it makes strong assumptions regarding the distribution of the underlying data (in particular, that themean equals the variance). While these assumptions aretenable in some settings, they are less appropriate for alco-hol consumption. Extensions of the Poisson, such as theover-dispersed Poisson, negative binomial and two stage (hurdle) or zero inflated models have been proposed [2- 5]. Our methods are motivated by the analysis of the ASAP (Addressing the Spectrum of Alcohol Problems) study, arandomized clinical trial comparing a brief motivationalinterview to usual care for a sample of inpatients with unhealthy alcohol use at an urban hospital [9]. These sub- jects were followed to see if there were differences indrinking outcomes that could be attributed to rand-omized group assignment. In this paper, we will demonstrate the limitations of the standard Poisson model in the presence of over-disper- sion. We begin by describing several count models foralcohol outcomes, compare their performance in a seriesof simulated randomized trials, apply them to the ASAPstudy, and conclude with some general recommenda-tions. Methods Statistical methods for the analysis of count outcomes We begin by introducing notation to be used throughout. Let Yij denote the number of events for the jth subject ( j = 1,..., ni) in the ith group ( i = 1, 2), where ni is the number of subjects in the ith group. Typically in a randomized trial n1 and n2 are approximately equal. The Poisson distribution is one of the simplest models for count data. Let ij indicate the average number of events (in this case drinks consumed) in a given time interval forsubject j in group i, where f(Y ij = k|ij) is the probability of observing k events. The Poisson distribution [8,10] is denoted: for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., i = 1, 2, and j = 1,..., ni where ij > 0 and we assume that ij = i for all j (i.e. all subjects in a given group have the same rate of drinking). The parameteruniquely specifies this distribution, and is equal to the expected value (mean) and variance (i.e. E[Yij] = Var(Yij) = ij for all i and j). The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of i is given by i. In this setting, the test of ran- domized group effects for the Poisson model is a test of the null hypothesis that 1 = 2. One limitation of this model is that it may be overly sim- plistic and may not provide an adequate fit to consump-tion data of the type that we consider. The constraint thatthe variance is equal to the mean may lead to incorrect testresults. Consider as an example the data from the ASAP study con- trol group at 3 months. For this dataset, non-integer countvalues are possible. These arise when subjects consume anumber of drinks not divisible by 30 (in the case of 30-day assessments). One approach in this situation wouldbe to model the number of drinks consumed in a 30 day period, or utilize the non-integer values. Sometimes even the 30 day value is non-integer because people report adrink size that is then translated into standard drinks. Themaximum likelihood estimates of the probability distri-butions remains the same for non-integer values, thoughit is necessary to move each non-integer observed value to the next integer (using a ceiling function) to be plotted. For the models that we discuss, we can plug non-integervalues into the software and still get sensible results. Figure 1 displays the observed distribution and superim- posed Poisson with 1 = 1 = 4.98 using the prcounts routine in Stata [8]. The axis for the number of drinks per day after 3 months was limited to 25 drinks to improvereadability (the maximum observed count was 48.6).There is a pronounced lack of fit to this model, particu-larly for values of less than 10 drinks per day. For the ASAPdata, the assumption that the mean is equal to the vari- ance is not tenable. In fact, the observed variance (71.7) is more than an order of magnitude larger than the mean.Also, note that there is some evidence for digit preference(even numbers are more common than odd numbers). One approach to loosen the restrictive variance assump- tion involves use of an empirical (or robust or sandwich ) variance estimator [11-13] to account for the over-disper-sion. This more flexible extension of the Poisson allows the variance to be unconstrained. The over-dispersed Pois- son option is available in a number of general purposestatistics packages (e.g. the robust option in Stata). Another approach is to fit a negative binomial (two parameter) count model http://www.biomedcent ral.com/1471-2288/7/9 Page 3 of 9 (page number not for citation purposes)parametrization of the negative binomial distribution is given by: where (\u00b7) denotes the Gamma function, i > 0 and i > 0. We note that E[Yij] = i and Var(Yij) = i + * i = i * (1 + i * i) for all i and j and that Var(Yij) > E[Yij]. It can be shown that the negative binomial can be derived in terms of a Poisson random variable where the parameter i varies according to a gamma distribution.The negative binomial model is attractive because it allows the relaxation of strong assumptions regarding therelationship between the mean and the variance. This flex-ibility comes at some cost, since a two-parameter model isinherently more complicated to interpret. Other models have been proposed that allow for an extra abundance of subjects with no consumption. In alcohol consumption outcomes, there may be subjects who are\"non-susceptible\" (e.g. abstinent). These \"zero-inflation\"(or \"hurdle\") models account for subjects who are struc-tural zeros (e.g., abstinent subjects thought of as \"non-susceptible\") [2,3]. Conditional on being susceptible (with some probability), the distribution is assumed to be Poisson or negative binomial.PY k k kij )== + 11 + 1 1 i iik i2Observed value of drinks per day for the co ntrol group of the ASAP study at 3 months , plus the estimated Poisson fit to these data (1 = 4.98) Figure 1 Observed value of drinks per day for the co ntrol group of the ASAP study at 3 months , plus the estimated Poisson fit to these data (1 = 4.98).0 5 10 15 20 250.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 # of drinks per day at 3 monthsprobabilityobserved Poisson predicted BMC Medical Research Methodology 2007, 7:9 http://www.biomedcent ral.com/1471-2288/7/9 Page 4 of 9 (page number not for citation purposes)Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) models [3] separately esti- mate a parameter pi that governs the proportion of non- susceptible subjects in the ith group: for 0 < pi < 1 and i > 0 where I(k = 0) is equal to 1 when k = 0, and equal to 0 otherwise. By distinguishing Always-0 (with probability pi) and Not Always-0 group (with proba- bility (1 - pi ) * exp(-i)) for abstainers and drinkers who didn't drink during the reporting period, respectively, itcan incorporate an overabundance of zeros [8]. Condi- tional on being a Not Always-0 , counts are given by the Poisson distribution. This approach has been generalizedto a regression framework, and implemented in generalpurpose statistical software (e.g. zip in Stata). In many settings, the assumption that after accounting for the zeros the remaining counts are Poisson may not be tenable. The zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB)allows for over-dispersion in this manner, though at thecost of more parameters. Another approach to the modeling of count data involves use of a linear model (assuming that the observations are approximately Gaussian). While this is an extremely flex- ible model that is typically robust to misspecification(since the mean and variance are not linked), the linearmodel is less attractive because it may predict negative val-ues of drinking given the skewness of the distribution. Useof a linear model is also inefficient if the variance is a func- tion of the mean. Simulation study To better understand the behavior of these methods in a known situation, we conducted a series of simulationstudies with parameters derived from the motivating example. These simulation studies were designed to address the question of whether or not the models wererobust to misspecification of the underlying count distri-bution. More formally, we wanted to assess whether thesemodels preserved the appropriate Type-I error rate (theprobability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true) when there are no true differences between groups (i.e. do they reject the null at the appropriate level). For each set of parameters within a simulation, 100 obser- vations were generated in each of two groups, to mimic arandomized clinical trial setting. The amount of alcoholconsumption, in drinks per day was the outcome. For each simulated dataset a series of models (Poisson, nega- tive binomial and zero-inflated Poisson) were fit. Thisprocess repeated 2500 times for each set of parame- ters, where E[Y i] = = 5 (taken from the ASAP control group) and an level of 0.05 was used. For the simulation of Poisson data the variance was equal to the mean. Neg-ative binomial distributions were simulated using threearbitrary variances (13.3, 40 and 70), with the latter valuecomparable to the observed variance from the ASAP con- trol group. The zero-inflated model had a probability of 0.2 of being a structural zero, and Poisson with = 5 oth- erwise. The true distributions for the simulations are dis-played in Figure 2. Models were fit using the Poissondistribution, over-dispersed Poisson using an empiricalvariance estimator, negative binomial and zero inflated Poisson. We estimated the probability that each model rejected the null hypothesis and constructed a 99% confi-dence interval around this estimate. The code for the sim-ulations is available upon request from the first author. ASAP study The ASAP study was a randomized clinical trial of the effectiveness of a brief motivational intervention [14] on alcohol consumption among a group of hospitalizedpatients at Boston Medical Center. Details of the recruit-ment procedures, inclusion criteria, description of sampleand results of the RCT have been published [15]. TheInstitutional Review Board of Boston University Medical Center approved this study, and the Institutional Review Board of Smith College approved the secondary analyses.After consenting to enroll, all subjects received an inter-viewer-administered baseline assessment prior to rand-omization into the control or intervention group. Subjectswere randomly assigned to control or intervention group using a blocked randomization procedure. Intervention subjects participated in a brief motivational interviewwith a counselor (less than half an hour). Control subjectsreceived usual care. Follow-up was planned at 3-month and 12-month time- points. Because the subjects came from a transient and hard-to-reach population, the researchers employedexhaustive techniques to track subjects over the follow-upperiod. The two primary alcohol-related outcomes weremeasures of alcohol consumption and linkage to appro-priate alcohol treatment; for these secondary analyses wefocus solely on treatment differences in alcohol consump- tion. The outcome of interest was the average number of standard drinks consumed per day in the past thirty daysas reported using the Timeline Followback method [1] atthe 3 and 12-month interviews. For the purpose of thissecondary analysis we consider the 3 month time point;similar results were seen utilizing 12 month data (not reported here). Eight models were fit comparing treatment to control for the ASAP study:fY k p Ik ral.com/1471-2288/7/9 Page 5 of 9 (page number citation purposes)Poisson standard Poisson ZINB zero-inflated negative inflation for ordinaldata, and PERMUTE two-sample permutation test. Results Simulation studies In the simulation studies we assessed the behavior of models when the null hypothesis was true (there were nodifferences between alcohol consumption for groups 1and 2). We note that the ZIP model failed to converge formore than a quarter of the simulations from the standard Poisson distribution. This is likely due to the fact that many datasets had no zeros whatsoever (for the Poissondistribution with = 5, the probability that a dataset has no zeros whatsoever is equal to (1 - exp(-5))100 = 0.51).Graphical display of the five di stributions, all with rate parame ter 5, used in the simulations (Poisson [Var = 5], negative bi no- mial 70] Poisson [ZIP, p = 0.2, Var = 8])Figure 2 Graphical display of the five di stributions, all with rate parame ter 5, used in the simulations (Poisson [Var = 5], negative bi no- mial 70] Poisson [ZIP, p = 0.2, Var = 8]).0 5 10 15 20 250.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 # of drinks per dayprobabilityNB (Var=70) NB ral.com/1471-2288/7/9 Page 6 of 9 (page number not for citation purposes)Table 1 displays the estimated Type I error rate (when there is no difference between the groups) when was set to 0.05. The negative binomial model was conservativewhen the underlying data were zero-inflated. When theunderlying distributions were not Poisson, the Poisson model did not maintain the appropriate Type I error rate. When the count models were over-dispersed by a factor ofmore than 2 (i.e. Var(Y i) > 2 * E[Yi]), the Poisson model rejected more than 22% of the time. When the over-dis-persion was more extreme (factor of 8 and 14), the Type Ierror rate was 47% and 58%, respectively. The severe lack of robustness of the Poisson model in this setting is a seri- ous concern. ASAP study Of 341 subjects enrolled in the clinical trial, 169 subjectswere randomized to the control group and the other 172 into the intervention group. The mean age of the subjects was 44.3 (SD = 10.7). Twenty-nine percent were women,45% were Black, 39% White, 9% Hispanic, and 7% Other.Sixty-three percent were unemployed during the pastthree months and 25% of the subjects were homeless atone point during the past three months. Four percent of the subjects met criteria for current (past year) alcohol abuse and 77% were alcohol dependent. We analyze the 3-month follow-up data for which 271 subjects were observed (141 control, 130 treatment), foran overall response rate of 79%. Table 2 displays the dis- tribution of drinks per day at baseline and 3-month fol-low-up separately for each group. As noted earlier,drinking outcomes are highly skewed to the right, withsome extremely large values. These extreme values are plausible given the large number of dependent drinkers in the sample, many of whom have developed tolerance (theneed to consume large amounts of alcohol to induceeffects). We also note that reported drinking quantitiesdecreased for both groups between baseline and 3-monthoutcome. Table 3 displays the results from the ASAP study using a variety of count models. Use of the Poisson model yieldeda statistically significant p-value, in contrast to the othermethods (all other p-values > 0.45). Figure 3 displays the observed and predicted counts for the Poisson, negative binomial, and ZIP models, whileFigure 4 displays the plot of (observed minus expected)for the Poisson, negative binomial and ZIP models for thecontrol group. The standard Poisson model provides anunsatisfactory fit, and is not appropriate for the analysis of this dataset. The fit of the zero-inflated Poisson is improved, particularly for modeling the probability of nodrinking, but remains unsatisfactory over most of theremaining values.

The Appendix includes the Stata commands to fit thesemodels and the output, along with the code to generateobserved and predicted plots using the prcounts routine. Discussion and conclusion A number of models have been proposed for the analysis of count data, and these models are now available in gen- eral purpose statistical packages. We have described thesemethods in the context of modeling reports of alcoholconsumption, where a large proportion of respondentsreport no drinking, and a small number of respondentstypically account for an extreme amount of drinking. For the analysis of the ASAP study, we found that the standard Poisson had an extremely poor fit, and yielded astatistically significant p-value (in contrast to all of theother models, which had highly non-significant results). The unrealistic assumption that the expected rate of drink- ing is the same for all subjects may partially account forthe poor fit of the Poisson distribution. We cautionagainst use of the Poisson for this analysis. The negativebinomial fit particularly well, and we saw no evidence forzero-inflation. In settings where there are excess zeros, zero-inflation models are attractive. One advantage of these models isthat they can estimate the probability of being a zero as afunction of covariates, as well as allowing the rate param-eter to be a function of covariates. In an alcohol study, theintervention may be hypothesized to affect the abstinence proportion as well as the rate parameter for drinkers. Ad- hoc methods in this setting might involve estimating theproportion of drinkers at follow-up, and in a separatemodel, estimating the amount of drinking amongst theObserved minus expected values from the ASAP study at 3 months as a function of count for the Poisson, ne gative binomial and zero-inflated PoissonFigure 4 Observed minus expected values from the ASAP study at 3 months as a function of count for the Poisson, ne gative binomial and zero-inflated 20 25\u00ef\u0013\u0011\u0014 \u0013\u0011\u0013 \u0013\u0011\u0014 \u0013\u0011\u0015 # of drinks per day at 3 monthsREVHUYHG\u0003\u00ef\u0003H[SHFWHGPoisson ]HUR\u00efLQIODWHG\u00033RLVVRQQHJDWLYH\u0003ELQRPLDOPublish with BioMed Central and every scientist can read your work free of charge \"BioMed Central will be the most significant development for disseminating the results of biomedical research in our lifetime.\" Sir Paul Nurse, Cancer Research UK Your research papers will be: available free of charge to the entire biomedical community peer reviewed and published immediately upon acceptance cited in PubMed and archived on PubMed Central yours \u2014 you keep the copyright Submit your manuscript here: http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/publishing_adv.aspBioMed centralBMC Medical Research Methodology 2007, 7:9 http://www.biomedcent ral.com/1471-2288/7/9 Page 9 of 9 (page number not for citation purposes)subset of subjects who reported any drinking. A more principled approach involves the simultaneous estima- tion of the zero-inflation factor (testing p1 = p2) and the rate parameter (testing 1 = 2). Slymen and colleagues [2] adopted this approach by simultaneously fitting separatemodels for what they describe as the \"logistic\" componentand the \"Poisson\" component, and this approach is also detailed in books by Winkelmann [7] as well as Cameron and Trivedi [4]. The results of the simulation studies and the secondary analyses of the ASAP study demonstrated the importanceof appropriately modeling count outcomes. We caution against the use of the standard Poisson model when the mean and variance are not equal. Extensions of the Pois-son (incorporating an over-dispersion parameter or use ofthe negative binomial distribution and/or zero-inflatedmodels) are now available in general purpose statisticalsoftware, and address many of the shortcomings of theoverly simplistic Poisson model. As always, analysts are obliged to look at their data and utilize models that provide an appropriate fit in their sit-uation. In particular, for models of alcohol consumption,attention should be paid to the functional form of the out-come to ensure that underlying assumptions of the meth- ods utilized are met.

By January 2005, phase 11 studies had begun in the US and Europe, and by March 2006, phase II studies had begun in Japan. Phase II trials for the prevention of thromboembolism wereongoingin mid2007. Introduction Vitamin K antagonist drugs (eg, warfarin) are highly efficacious for the prevention and treatment of venous and arterial thrombosis. However, despite their proven efficacy these drugs have significant drawbacks that limit their effectiveness, including a variable dose response and narrow therapeutic window. These features, coupled with common drug and food interactions, mandate frequent monitoring of patients which constitutes a significant barrier to their use in clinical care [814315]. Factor Xa (FXa)has a pivotal role in the coagulation cascade, common to both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, and is therefore a rational and potent target for new antithrombotic therapies [484147], [815221]. It is estimated that a single molecule of FXa is capable of generating 1000 molecules of thrombin, highlighting the desirability of suppressing the coagulation cascade proximal to thrombin [814319). Direct FXa inhibitors are not dependent on antithrombin to exert their antithrombotic effect, unlike the indirect FXa inhibitor fondaparinux [323346]. Thus, direct activity combined with high selectivity enables the inhibition of FXa within the prothrombinase complex in addition to free FXa [814323], [816052]. DU-176b is an orally active, being developed by Daiichi Sankyo Inc [676138]. The first clinical candidate, DX-9065a, was developed by former subsidiary Daiichi Pharmaceuticals Co Ltd in Japan [158251]; however, clinical development of this compound was halted because of its poor oral bioavailability [638308]. DU-176b is currently in multinational phase lIb clinical trials for the potential prevention of deep vein thrombosis among individuals undergoing hip and knee replacement surgery [659999], [676138J. Synthesis and SAR DX-9065a was shown to be an effective FXa inhibitor with low intestinal tract absorption; therefore, structural Originator Dalichi Sankyo Inc (formerly Daiichi Seiyaku Ltd) Factor (oral activity optimization was undertaken. X-ray crystallography revealed that 6-chloronaphthalene was a suitable replacement for the amidinonaphthyl group, the portion of the molecule which binds at the Sl site of FXa. Modification of the piperazine linker, and substitution of the pyrrolidin-I\u00ad yl-iminoimine with 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothiazolo[5,4-cJpyridine, resulted in a compound that exhibited an activity of 4.4 flM in an assay of the concentration required to double prothrombin time (PT) in human plasma (the PTCT2 assay) [567056J, [733062J. The low metabolic stability of this structure necessitated further SAR analysis. As a result, the 6-chloronaphthalene moiety was replaced with 6.chloro-benzo[b]thiophene, while the thiazolo[5,4-cJpyridine group at the 54 binding region of the molecule was substituted with thieno[3,2-bJpyridine 4-oxide [733058]. The resulting compound had an activity of 3.2 pM in a PTCT2 assay and a clearance of 6.97 ml/min/kg. In a subsequent study, the most active compound (PTCT2 = 0.54 ~lM) retained a pyridine-oxide group, while incorporating the structurally similar 6-chloro\u00ad benzo[b]pyrrole [733061]. Several potent oral FXa inhibitors were identified in these studies; however, DU-176b was not specifically identified. In addition, none of the lead compounds had properties sufficiently similar to those described in the limited published data on DU-176b; therefore, it is not possible to infer a structure or formula for DU-176b. Preclinical development DU-176b competitively inhibited human FXa ill vitro (K, = 0.56 nM) and displayed 10,000-fold affect the enzymatic activities proteases (ie, activator, plasmin, trypsin or chymotrypsin) [573107J. In in vitro studies with human plasma, DU-176b concentration-dependently increased PT and partial thromboplastin time (PTr), the standard measures of the extrinsic (PT) and intrinsic (PTr) coagulation pathways [573107], [812208]. Clotting were doubled at concentrations of 0.256 at 0.508 ~IM, respectively. Following oral administration of DU-176b to rats, anti-FXa activity was demonstrated in plasma over 4 h [573107J. In a rat model of thrombogenesis induced by insertion of a wire into the vena cava, thrombosis was inhibited by was observed between the anti thrombotic and bleeding effects. This margin of safety for DU-176b was wider than for heparin, low-molecular weight heparin and warfarin, which inhibited thrombosis in this model (EDsll = 56 and 66 U/kg/h and 0.16 mg/kg/day, respectively) but prolonged bleeding time at doses slightly higher than the effective doses (1.3-,2.0- and 1.3-fold, respectively) [573101], [812208]. DU-176b was also compared with the FXa inhibitor fondaparinux in rat models chloride and venous the insertion of a wire [573105]. DU-176b was administered at 0.05 to 1.25 mg/kg/h in both models, while fondaparinux was administered at 1 to 10 mg/ kg/h in the arterial model and 0.03 to 1 mg/kg/h in the venous model. DU-176b was effective at preventing both arterial and venous thrombosis; however, fondaparinux required a 100-fold arterial thrombosis with venous deficient (ATr/\") mice, the antithrombotic effect of DU-176b more potent than fondaparinux and mice, fondaparinux and heparin were less potent. Efficacy was evaluated in rat models under different blood sheer rates to simulate venous flow and flow through a narrowed artery using an ex vivo capillary perfusion chamber [812206]. In the same dose range (0.3 to 3.0 mg/kg/h), intravenous DU-176b significantly reduced thrombus formation under both venous and arterial blood sheer rates. Significantly higher doses of intravenous fondaparinux (values not stated) were necessary to inhibit thrombus formation at the higher arterial sheer rate (-66\u00ad fold higher dose than for the lower sheer rate). In addition, scanning electron microscopy revealed inhibition of fibrin net formation by DU-176b at both sheer rates and a limited effect on fibrin by fondaparinux at the high sheer rate [811466]. Because of its high selectivity and direct action, DU-176b has been shown to suppress FXa bound within the prothrombinase complex (K, = 2.98 nM) [811474]. DU-176b inhibited the physiological complex comprising FXa, FVa, calcium and phospholipids. This was in contrast with indirect FXa inhibitors such as fondaparinux, where the effect was limited to free FXa [811474],[816052J. Additional animal studies compared DU-176b to melagatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor used as a research tool. There are hypothetical advantages of direct FXa inhibition compared with direct thrombin inhibition, including the potential for decreased rebound hypercoagulability upon anticoagulant withdrawal. In an in vivo model of hypercoagulability induced by a tissue factor (thromboplastin, a protein that initiates thrombin DU-176b Hylek 779 formation), were melagatran (2 mg/kg) or DU-176b drugs inhibited platelet consumption and thrombin\u00ad antithrombin complex formation when tissue factor hypercoagulation was induced 5 min after drug administration. However, at 2 and 4 h after dosing, injection of tissue factor resulted in increased platelet consumption and formation of thrombin-antithrombin complexes with melagatran, indicating recurrent stimulation of coagulation. Preliminary data in rat models of thrombosis (induced by arterial injection of ferric chloride, venous insertion of a wire into the vena cava) have also suggested an additive benefit of DU-176b when combined with other anti thrombotic agents. A low dose of DU-176b (2 mg/kg po) combined with a low dose of the antiplatelet drug ticlopidine (30 mg/kg po) exhibited a more potent antithrombotic effect than either agent alone [812200]. Combination of the same DU-176b dose with the tissue plasminogen activator pamiteplase (1000 kU/mg iv) had effect. Major hemorrhage, particularly intracranial hemorrhage, constitutes the most serious adverse effects of anticoagulants; therefore, reversibility of the anticoagulant effect is desirable particularly in an emergency situation. Recently presented data provide insight into the neutralizing effects on the activity of DU-176b of three approved reverse anticoagulants/factor replacements: prothrombin complex concentrate (Feiba; 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 U/ml), recombinant Factor VIII (Kogenate-FS; 0.1, 1.0 and 6.7 U/ml) and Factor IX (Christmassin-M; 0.1, 1.0 and 6.7 U/ml) [811628J. In this in vitro study of human plasma and varying concentrations of DU-176b (150, 300 and 450 ng/ml), all three agents shortened PlT. The addition of a prothrombin complex concentrate reversed both PT and PIT in a concentration-dependent manner. Recombinant Factor VIla also effectively corrected the prolongation of PT over a similar dose range [812203J. In a rat model of template bleeding, recombinant Factor VIla (5, 50 and 500 ng/ml) given as a bolus injection corrected the bleeding time in a dose-dependent manner following infusion of DU-176b (1 mg/kg/h iv) over 2 h. Animal data have also been presented on the effect of DU-176b infusion compared with melagatran infusion immediately following induction of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) by a collagenase solution [736678], [811467J. At a dose of 3 mg/kg/h, DU-176b had no effect on ICH volume. However, lCH volume increased by 180 and 230% at 6 and 18 mg/kg/h, and PT was prolonged by 2.8-and 6.5-fold, respectively. There were no deaths associated with these doses. Melagatran exerted no effect on ICH volume at the 0.3-mg/kg/h dose; however, at 1 and 3 mg/kg/h, lCH volume increased by 280 and 390%, and PT prolongation was 6.1-and > 30-fold, respectively. All rats in the 3-mg/kg/h melagatran group died. The safety margins for DU-176b and melagatran, the ratio of the dose required for ICH exacerbation to the EDso value for thrombosis prevention, were 133 and 7, respectively. 780 Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs 2007 Vol 8 No9 Toxicity No preclinical toxicology data were available at the time of publication. Metabolism and pharmacokinetics No data were available on the pharmacokinetics or metabolism of DU-176b at the time of publication. The oral bioavailability of DU-176b in monkeys was approximately 50% compared with 10% for DX-9065a; however, no further details were available [812208]. In a phase I trial in 12 healthy male volunteers administered a single dose of DU-176b (60 mg), drug levels at 1.5, 5.0 and 12.0 h post-dose were 240 (\u00b1 54), 127 (\u00b1 22) and 37 (\u00b1 10) ng/rnl, respectively [733059]. However, no further details were provided. Detailed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses are among the objectives of the ongoing phase II trials with DU-176b [815272], [815227]. Clinical development Phase I In a phase I trial, 12 healthy male volunteers (aged 28 \u00b1 6 years) were administered single doses of DU-176b(60mg) [733059]. Antithrombotic effects were assessed by serial measurement of thrombus size at 1.5, 5.0 and 12.0 h post-dose using a Badimon chamber under both venous and arterial flow conditions. At 1.5 and 5.0 h post-dose, venous thrombosis was reduced by 28 and 21%, respectively, and arterial thrombosis was reduced by 26 and 17%, respectively. At 12 h, the reduction in thrombosis was 3% under both flow conditions. Changes in clotting parameters, anti-FXa activity and thrombin generation paralleled the anti thrombotic effects. Anti-FXa activity at 1.5, 5.0 and 12.0 h was 3.6, 1.6 and 0.3 IV/mI, respectively, and PTs were 20.3, 17.5 and 14.7 s, respectively, compared with 13.4s at baseline. Phase /I A phase IIa, open-label, dose-ranging trial assessed the efficacy, safety and tolerability of oral DU-176b for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after total hip replacement [815225]. The trial enrolled 402 patients to receive once or twice daily oral doses of DU-176b. The trial was reportedly completed in July 2005; however, no data were available at the time of publication. A phase Ilb, double-blind trial of DU-176b for the prevention of VTEfollowing total hip replacement commenced in the US, Europe, Canada, Russian Federation and Ukraine in May 2006 [815272]. This randomized, multiple dose trial was designed tocompare the safety and efficacyofDU-176bwith dalteparin for the prevention of VTE. The target enrollment was 950 patients, who were to receive 7 to 10 days of treatment. Secondary outcome measures were the incidence of VTE and major and clinically relevant non-major bleeds with DU-176b compared with dalteparin, and assessment of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of DU-176b [815272]. Phase lIb trials were reportedly ongoing in Japan in 2006 [676138]; however, no details are available. A phase II trial is also underway to compare DU-176b with warfarin in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation [815227]. Patients were to receive one of four fixed-dose regimens of DU-176b or warfarin (doses unstated) for 3 months followed by a 3D-day follow-up. The primary endpoint was safety and secondary outcomes, including the assessment of major cardiac adverse events, pharmaco\u00ad kinetics and pharmacodynamics. The trial began recruiting patients in the US, Europe, South America, Mexico and the Russian Federation in June 2007. No announcements have been made regarding phase III studies with DU-176b. Side effects and contraindications No data on clinical side effects were available at the time of publication. Patent summary Daiichi Sankyo has published several patents claiming FXa inhibitors. EP-00540051, published in May 1993,claims several series of thrombolytic compounds, one of which is DX-9065a. Claims were extended in WO-09854132 (December 1998), which exemplifies synthesis routes for 126 compounds, and WO-09933458 (luly 1999) which discloses formulations for percutaneous administration. Subsequently, (Ianuary 2003) claims ethylenediamines. 2006, claims diarnino\u00ad substituted cyclicamine compounds. DU-176b is not mentioned by name, and no structure or formula is apparently disclosed in the patent literature. It is not possible, therefore, to clarify which cases are important to DU-176b, or determine the relationship to DX-9065a.The only patent that mentions DU-176b (together with leading FXa inhibitors from other companies) is WO-2006106695, published by Kissei Pharmaceutical Co Ltd in October 2006, which discloses a coagulation system assay for quantifying the activity of an FXa inhibitor. Current opinion DU-176b is a novel, highly selective, oral direct FXa inhibitor. DU-176b has antithrombotic efficacy in preclinical models equivalent to or better than heparin, warfarin, melagatran or fondaparinux, with a significantly wider therapeutic window. Its antithrombotic effects have been demonstrated in both venous and arterial conditions in a preclinical model. Preclinical results suggest that the anticoagulant effect of DU-176b may be reversed (at least partially) by factor replacement. However, whether or not these agents will alter clinical outcomes in the presence of serious bleeding is unknown and requires further investigation. DU-176b is currently in phase II/lIb trials based on convincing preclinical data and positive results of phase I studies. However, until more clinical data become available, it is premature to extrapolate preclinical results to the clinical setting. The limited clinical data for DU-176b at the time of publication also prohibit comparisons to other direct FXa inhibitors. The advantages of DU-176b over the current standards of care are true of other oral direct FXa inhibitors. This drug class shows great promise and has the capacity to revolutionize anticoagulant therapy [816290]. Other direct oral FXa inhibitors include rivaroxaban (Bayer AG/Ortho\u00ad McNeil Pharmaceutical Inc), apixaban (Bristol-Myers Squibb [816291]. Of these, apixaban and rivaroxaban are more advanced in clinical development than DU-176b, as they are currently undergoing phase III trials. LY-517717, YM-150 and PRT-054021 are in phase II trials and 813893 is in phase I trials [816291]. The wide therapeutic window of the oral direct FXa inhibitors coupled with the limited potential for food and drug interactions will eliminate the need for monitoring in most cases, a situation that is currently mandated with vitamin K antagonists. The shorter half-life will also eliminate the need Deve opmen t status Literature classifications B'I100gV DU-176b Hylek 781 for bridging anticoagulants in invasive procedures. Despite these advances, several key issues remain unanswered until more robust clinical information is available for DU-176b, or for the other drugs. It is uncertain whether these agents will extend anticoagulant therapy to elderly individuals who are at the highest risk for major hemorrhage [816287]. Because renal function declines with age, safety in the elderly population will need to be rigorously demonstrated. Reversibility of the anticoagulant effect may be less of an issue with drugs characterized by shorter half-lives; however, reversibility in the setting of a life-threatening hemorrhage would be highly desirable, particularly if shown to improve clinical outcomes. The shorter half-life of newer agents will place greater emphasis on medication adherence. Large-scale phase III studies will answer these questions and, ultimately, the success of direct FXa inhibitors such as DU-176b will depend upon demonstrated efficacy and safety, particularly among older individuals for whom the need for antithrombotic therapy continues to expand.

DU-176b and warfarin also inhibited thrombosis (ED 50 = 56 and 66 Ulkg/hand 0.16 mg/kg/day, respectively). These drugs prolonged bleeding time at doses 1.3-, 2.0- and 1.3-fold above the effective dose, respectively, compared with a 10-foldsafety margin for DU-176b. 573101 In vitro Efficacy Human plasma treated with DU-176b (150,300 and 450 ng/ml) plus prothrombin complex concentrate (Feiba; 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 Ulml), recombinant Factor VIII (Kogenate-FS; 0.1. 1.0 and 6.7 Ulml)or Factor IX (Christmassin-M; 0.1, 1.0 and 6.7 Ulm). All three reverse anticoagulants shortened the PTI.

NEWS AND VIEWS http://www.nature.com/ncpcardio/j oumal/v4/n4/full/ncpcardio0800 .html;j sessi onid=D62FC... 7/1/2008 COMMENTARY Stroke is the leading cause of disability and the third most common cause of death. AF is a powerful risk factor for stroke. Cardioembolic strokes are associated with higher mortality and more severe disability than other ischemic stroke subtypes. It is widely accepted that emboli in AF originate in the left atrial appendage where the confluence of stasis, hypercoagulability, and endothelial dysfunction predispose to thrombus formation, Factors that promote embolization of in-situ thrombus are poorly understood. Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) have been shown to greatly reduce the risk of stroke in AF. The unanticipated effect of D\\J\"R intensity on stroke severity and mortality has now been validated in three studies most recently by O'Donnell et al. These independent studies conducted within distinct AF populations in the United States', Norway', and now Canada have all shown that an INR 2:2 at the time of stroke is associated with decreased severity and reduced stroke-related mortality compared to patients presenting with INR <2. Although the effect of pre-stroke aspirin was also assessed, the pivotal comparison is within the warfarin group as comparison across treatment groups is subject to selection bias and possible confounding related to initial non-random assignment of antithrombotic drug. These studies collectively provide powerful evidence for the optimal intensity of anticoagulation for preventing ischemic stroke and stroke-related disability and mortality in AF. Recently revised guidelines recommend VKAs (e.g., warfarin) with an INR target of2.0-3.0 for patients with a history of stroke or TIA and for those with 2:2 moderate risk factors, i.e., hypertension, age 2:75, diabetes mellitus, or heart failure. Among patients with only 1 of these 4 risk factors, aspirin or VKAs may be considered based on patient preference and hemorrhagic risk given the expected lower rate of stroke? The clinical challenge arises when patients at high risk of stroke also have a propensity for hemorrhage, a scenario encountered more frequently as we care for older and more medically complicated patients. Although major extracranial hemorrhage causes significant morbidity and often precipitates cessation of warfarin, its long-term sequelae are not comparable in severity to cardioembolic stroke. From the patient's perspective, a disabling stroke is often viewed as equivalent as or worse than death.\" Interventions to reduce hemorrhage should be aggressively implemented to optimize the effectiveness of anticoagulant therapy. Revised guidelines newly advise against use of aspirin for stable coronary artery disease among patients taking warfarin.' Blood pressure control has been shown to decrease the risk of both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Because the first 90 days of warfarin convey the highest risk, vigilant INR monitoring is essential. Elderly patients require lower doses of warfarin and are slower to normalize an elevated INR. Physicians and patients need to be cognizant of the most powerful precipitants of erratic control, e.g., decompensated heart failure, amiodarone, chemotherapy, to better anticipate changes in bleeding risk. Lower target intensity, INR 1.5-2.5, has not been shown to decrease major bleeding and therefore likely only exposes patients to unacceptable stroke risk.5 Finally, it is hoped that newer anticoagulant drugs with a wider therapeutic index and shorter half-life will translate into safer, yet equally efficacious, alternatives to warfarin. 1.

Major Hemorrhage and Tolerability of Warfarin in the First Year of Therapy Among Elderly Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Elaine M. Hylek, MD, MPH; Henault, MPH; Susan Regan, PhD Background\u2014Warfarin is effective in the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation but is under used in clinical care. Concerns exist that published rates of hemorrhage may not reflect real-world practice. Few patients /H1135080 years of age were enrolled in trials, and studies of prevalent use largely reflect a warfarin-tolerant subset. We sought to define the tolerability of warfarin among an elderly inception cohort with atrial fibrillation. Methods and Results \u2014Consecutive patients who started warfarin were identified from January 2001 to June 2003 and followed for 1 year. Patients had to be /H1135065 years of age, have established care at the study institution, and have their warfarin managed on-site. Outcomes included major hemorrhage, time to termination of warfarin, and reason fordiscontinuation. Of 472 patients, 32% were /H1135080 years of age, and 91% had /H113501 stroke risk factor. The cumulative incidence of major hemorrhage for patients /H1135080 years of age was 13.1 per 100 person-years and 4.7 for those /H1102180 years of age (P/H110050.009). The first 90 days of warfarin, age /H1135080 years, and international normalized ratio (INR) /H113504.0 were associated with increased risk despite trial-level anticoagulation control. Within the first year, 26% of patients /H1135080 years of age stopped taking warfarin. Perceived safety issues accounted for 81% of them. Rates of major hemorrhage andwarfarin termination were highest among patients with CHADS 2scores (an acronym for congestive heart failure, hypertension, age /H1135075, diabetes mellitus, and prior stroke or transient ischemic attack) of /H113503. Conclusions\u2014Rates of hemorrhage derived from younger noninception cohorts underestimate the bleeding that occurs in practice. This finding coupled with the short-term tolerability of warfarin likely contributes to its underutilization. Strokeprevention among elderly patients with atrial fibrillation remains a challenging and pressing health concern.(Circulation. 2007;115:2689-2696.) Key Words: anticoagulants /H18546atrial fibrillation /H18546hemorrhage /H18546stroke Warfarin is highly effective in the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF).1,2Despite its proven benefit, studies attest to its underutilization particularly among elderlyindividuals who face the highest risk. 3-6In a recent study of 21 teaching, 13 community, and 4 Veterans Administrationhospitals in 28 states, the use of warfarin at discharge was54% even among patients considered to be at highest risk. 7 Age/H1102280 years and perceived bleeding risk were negative predictors of warfarin use. In a recent prospective study, 51%of patients were discharged on warfarin. Of those not onwarfarin, 83% had /H113502 risk factors for stroke and 23% had taken warfarin in the past but were unable to tolerate it in thelong term. 8Stroke is the leading cause of disability and the third leading cause of death in the United States with anestimated annual total cost of 57.9 billion dollars. 9Given the aging of our population, it is projected that 7.5 millionindividuals will have AF in the United States by the year 2020 on the basis of an expected prevalence of 13.5% forindividuals /H1135075 years of age, and 18.2% for those /H1135085 years. 10 Editorial p 2684 Clinical Perspective p 2696 Rates of major hemorrhage from randomized trials and observational cohorts have been reassuringly low.11-15 How- ever, published rates may be underestimates, as few patients /H1102280 years of age were enrolled and few cohort studiesinclude the initial phase of therapy, which is reported toconvey the highest risk. 13,16-19 Observational noninception cohort studies focus on prevalent warfarin use among indi-viduals who have proven they can tolerate anticoagulanttherapy. Moreover, recent trials have also largely enrolledpatients on vitamin K antagonists at study entry. 20-22 Continuing medical education (CME) credit is available for this article.

Long-termtolerability of anticoagulant therapy is largely unknown andmay also be a contributing factor. We conducted an inceptioncohort study to define the rate of major hemorrhage inpatients at warfarin initiation and to define the risk ofbleeding in the early phase of therapy. We also focused on thetolerability of warfarin during the first year and determinedthe physician reason for discontinuation with attention toperceived safety issues. Methods Design and Patients To be eligible, patients had to be /H1135065 years of age, have AF verified by ECG, be new to warfarin (or had taken none within the previous 12 months), have their care established at the study institution, andhave their warfarin managed by the on-site anticoagulation clinic.Potentially eligible patients were prospectively identified throughdaily searches of electronic admission notes of patients admitted tothe medical service of Massachusetts General Hospital from January2001 to June 2003. We intentionally did not screen patients admitted to the stroke or surgical service given their higher baseline risk ofbleeding. Outpatients who started warfarin were identified at thetime of the faxed physician referral to the anticoagulation clinic andwere tracked to the first appointment. Referred ambulatory patientswith AF-related stroke were eligible only if the event had occurredat least 4 weeks before the first appointment. Outcomes Patients were enrolled on the first day of warfarin and followedthrough the first year. Outcomes included major hemorrhage, time totermination of warfarin, and physician reason for discontinuation.Major hemorrhage was defined as fatal, hospitalization with trans-fusion of /H113502 units of packed red blood cells, or involvement of a critical site (ie, intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraspinal, (INR) at the time of the event was recordedin addition to other potentially contributing factors such as a fall. Thereason for warfarin termination was recorded from the medicalrecord. If the reason was not explicitly stated, the physician wasqueried directly. Reasons for termination included major hemor-rhage, other hemorrhage, falls, patient nonadherence with medica-tion or monitoring, coagulopathy, or sustained sinus rhythm. TABLE 1.

Stroke riskscores were calculated according to the CHADS 2scheme (congestive heart failure/H110051 point, hypertension/H110051, age /H1135075/H110051, litus/H110051, and prior stroke or transient ischemic attack/H110052).23Concur- rent medications were obtained from the discharge summary, elec-tronic medication list, and physician office record and were verifiedby the patient or family member at the first anticoagulation appoint-ment. Use of aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medicationswas also recorded. Anticoagulation Intensity and Warfarin Management Per clinic routine, all patients attended a mandatory 60-minute educational session on warfarin. Time spent in the INR ranges /H110212.0, 2.0 to 3.0, 3.1 to /H110214.0, and /H113504.0 was calculated with linear interpolation following the method described by Rosendaal et al.24 This method does not interpolate an INR if the interval between 2consecutive measurements exceeds 8 weeks. Statistical Analysis Baseline differences between age groups were evaluated with /H92732tests for categorical variables and ttests for continuous variables. Crude event rates were calculated for different age groups, INR categories,time since warfarin initiation, and CHADS 2categories by division of the number of first events by the total person-years of follow-up inthe specified category. The INR at the time of event was unobtain-able for 1 patient and this patient was excluded from analyses thatinvolved this variable. Poisson regression models with generalizedestimating equations were used to calculate incidence rate ratios(IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The number of eventsprecluded use of a multivariable regression model. Cumulative incidence of major bleeding and intolerability of therapy, defined as stopping warfarin therapy for safety reasons,were both estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Time to majorbleeding was censored at the time of cessation of warfarin therapy, death, or transfer of medical care, whereas time to cessation ofwarfarin was censored for reasons other than safety, death, ortransfer of medical care. Log-rank tests were used to assess differ-ences between the 2 age groups. For all analyses, a 2-sidedprobability value /H110210.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed with Stata statistical software, release 8.0(Stata Corporation, College Station, Tex.). Role of the Funding Source The sponsor had no role in the design and conduct of the study, thecollection, analysis, and interpretation of data, or in the preparation,review, and approval of the manuscript.

The authors had full access to and take full responsibility for the integrity of the data. All authors have read and agree to themanuscript as written. Results During the study period, 533 patients were identified and 472 were enrolled; 61% of patients had their warfarin managedelsewhere (eg, at a skilled nursing facility) and were notincluded. A total of 47% of patients were female and 54%were/H1102275 years of age (32% were /H1135080 years of age) (Table 1). A total of 59% (n/H11005279) of patients presented with the firstdocumented episode of AF and 35% (n/H11005165) with a recur- rent episode. Thirty-five percent of patients had documentedcoronary artery disease, and 40% overall were on aspirin for primary or secondary prevention. 25Compared with risk factors for stroke, potential risk factors for hemorrhage wereless common except for older age. Of the 472 patients, 33%were enrolled at hospital discharge; 42% of these were /H1135080 years of age. Symptoms related to an uncontrolled ventricularrate prompted admission for the majority of patients. A totalof 90% of patients /H1135080 years had a CHADS 2score/H113502. With the use of the Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index, 95.3% ofpatients would have been classified as intermediate risk and4.7% as high risk for major hemorrhage at the start ofwarfarin. 26 Follow-up was complete for 100% of the cohort. During the first year of therapy, 134 patients were taken off warfarin,16 died of unrelated causes, 16 transferred their warfarinmanagement, and 306 patients remained on warfarin at theend of the 1-year observation period. The total observationtime was 360 person-years. Anticoagulation Control The total number of INR measurements was 10 031. Person-time by INR category could not be determined for 21person-years (5.7%) of the total time on warfarin. During thestudy, 58% of person-time was spent within the INR range2.0 to 3.0, 29% below 2.0, 11% within 3.1 to /H110214.0, and 2% /H113504.0. Major Hemorrhage During the first year, 26 patients sustained a major hemor-rhage (9 intracranial, 11 gastrointestinal, 1 retroperitoneal, 1hemothorax after a fall, 1 ocular, 1 hemarthrosis, and 2epistaxis that required transfusions). The rate of major hem-orrhage was 7.2 per 100 person-years (95% CI 4.9 to 10.6),and the rate of was 2.5% (95% CI 1.1to 4.7). Patients /H1135080 years of age experienced higher rates of major bleeding compared with younger patients (13.08 per100 person-years versus 4.75 per 100 person-years, Figure 1. Cumulative incidence of major bleeding among patients aged /H1135080 years and /H1102180 years (n/H11005472). Numbers below graph are the number of patients without bleeding who continued on warfarin at that time point (P/H110050.009, log-rank test).Hylek et al Major Hemorrhage in Atrial Fibrillation Patients 2691 at BOSTON UNIV MEDICAL LIB on August 8, 2011 http://circ.ahajournals.org/ Downloaded from P/H110050.010). Figure 1 shows the cumulative major hemorrhage rate over time between the 2 age groups ( P/H110050.009). Table 2 presents rates of hemorrhage by 3 risk factors, INR range, age group, and time since warfarin initiation. Risk of hemorrhagewas increased by INR /H113504.0 2.75, 95% CI 1.27 to 5.95), and thefirst 90 days of therapy (IRR 3.31, 95% CI 1.51 to 7.25). INR/H113504.0 increased the risk, although only 2% of person-time wasspent in this range. Fifteen of the 26 major hemorrhages(58%) occurred within 90 days of warfarin initiation, 11within 30 days, and 7 within the first 2 weeks. Six of these 7patients were enrolled at the time of hospital discharge; 2were bridged with heparin. INR elevation was correlated withthe other 2 risk factors. Of the 8 patients who experienced amajor hemorrhage with an INR /H113504.0, 5 patients sustained the hemorrhage within 90 days, 5 patients were /H1135080 years of age, and 3 patients had all 3 risk factors. Of the 15 hemorrhagicevents that occurred within the first 90 days, the INR was/H113504.0 in 5 of them. However, age and time since warfarininitiation remained significant predictors when analysis wasrestricted to INR /H110214 (Table 2). In the overall cohort, 40% of patients were on aspirin. Twelve of the 26 events (46%) occurred on aspirin andincluded 5 gastrointestinal and 4 intracranial bleeds. The dose was 81 mg for 8 of these patients. Nine of the 12 eventsoccurred with an INR /H110214 and 6 patients were /H1102180 years of age. Of the total 9 intracranial bleeds, 3 were fatal, 6 wereintracerebral, and 2 were associated with documented falls.INR values were available for 8 patients and exceeded 4.0 in3 of them. One intracerebral bleed occurred within the first 30days, and 8 of 9 bleeds occurred in patients who were /H1135075 years of age (3 were /H1135080 years of age). Overall, the rate of major hemorrhage was higher in those with CHADS 2scores of/H113503 Tolerability of Warfarin Among Patients >80 Years of Age By the end of the first year, 134 patients had been taken offwarfarin. Sustained sinus rhythm was the predominant reasonfor those /H1102180 years of age, 63% (57 of 91 patients), compared with those /H1135080 years of age, 19% (8 of 43 patients). Concerns related to safety accounted for 81% ofthose patients /H1135080 years of age who stopped therapy during the first year (17 bleeding complications, 9 falls, 5 nonadher-ence with drug or monitoring, 3 coagulopathy, and 1 derma-tologic reaction) compared with 37% of patients /H1102180 years ofTABLE 2.

Figure 2 shows the smoothed hazard esti- mates over time for the 2 age groups. The risk of stopping warfarin peaked early and then, beginning at 6 months,approximated that of younger patients. With death andmaintenance of sinus rhythm excluded as reasons for warfarincessation, 26% of patients /H1135080 years of age stopped warfarin within the first year. Similar to major hemorrhage, the rate ofwarfarin termination for perceived safety concerns washigher among patients with CHADS 2scores of /H113503 (IRR 2.27, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.66) (Table 3). Discussion We found the rate of major hemorrhage on warfarin to be higher than previously reported. The aggregate rate was 7.2per 100 person-years and 13.08% versus 4.75% for patients/H1135080 years of age compared with patients /H1102180 years of age. The first 90 days were associated with a 3-fold increased risk.Although only 2% of person-years were spent in an INRrange of /H113504.0, INR was a strong risk factor. The long-term tolerability of warfarin among individuals /H1135080 years of age has not previously been assessed. We found that 26% of thesepatients were taken off warfarin; concerns related to safetyaccounted for 81% of them.The higher rate of major hemorrhage is likely attributable to the advanced age of our study population and restriction of our cohort to patients who started warfarin (Table 4). A totalof 32% (n/H11005153) of patients were /H1135080 years of age compared with a total of 20 patients /H1102275 in the pooled analysis of the first 5 randomized trials. Higher rates of hemorrhage werefound in the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation II Study,which consisted of 2 parallel trials of patients aged /H1102275 years and/H1134975 years. 27Of note, the trials used an INR target range of 2.0 to 4.5. Annual rates of major bleeding were 4.2% and1.7%, respectively. In our study, we reaffirmed the time-dependence of risk that has been shown in other studies.Underestimation of early adverse events and early cessationof warfarin among higher-risk patients likely contribute to thelower rates of bleeding reported from studies with prevalentuser designs that largely reflect a warfarin-tolerant subset.This issue is particularly relevant given recent trials that haveenrolled up to 84% of patients on warfarin at baseline. 20-22 Given the findings of our study, differences in treatmenteffect would be anticipated between prevalent users and thosenew to therapy. 22New warfarin status may also help to explain the finding of increased bleeding among patients with a first episode of AF.15Our study highlights the importance of new-user designs in the evaluation of newer antithromboticdrugs to minimize survivor bias and to better assess drugeffects in the early period. 28,29The rate of major hemorrhage found in our study is similar to that of other inception cohortswith several caveats (Table 4). These studies included pa-tients with different indications and higher INR target inten-sities and, in the Landefeld 16and Beyth26studies, 100% of patients were identified at hospital discharge. In contrast, ourstudy was restricted to patients with AF, target INR of 2.0 to3.0, and 33% were identified at discharge. The distinctdifference is the age of the patients enrolled: 6% versus 32%were/H1135080 years of age. Elevated INR is a firmly established risk factor for hemorrhage. The percent of person-years spent in an INR range /H110223.0 in our study, 13%, was nearly identical to that reported in 2 recent trials, 12% 21and 15%,22which emphasizes the quality of anticoagulation that was achieved. A potential limitation of our study is that it was conducted at a single academic center that may not reflect other settings.However, the rate of bleeding found in our study may be anunderestimate of that experienced in practice. We did notinclude patients whose warfarin was managed outside of ourTABLE 3.

Because the clinic does not manage the warfarin of long-term care residents, these potentially frailer patientswere not included. Patients had to have their longitudinal careestablished at the study institution to minimize referral bias,and those with higher baseline risk of bleeding (eg, acutestroke, postoperative AF) were not included. We do notbelieve that physicians were overly aggressive in the use ofwarfarin, given the lower prevalence of risk factors forhemorrhage at baseline compared with the high prevalence ofrisk factors for ischemic stroke. In addition, as we hadpreviously reported, the prevalence of risk factors for bleed-ing was considerably higher among patients not prescribedwarfarin at hospital discharge compared with that of patientsenrolled in the current study: prior hemorrhage 32% dysfunction 29% versus 11%. 8O n l y3o f2 6 patients who sustained a major hemorrhage would have beenclassified as high risk by the Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index.However, it is of note that this index was derived from acohort with a mean age of 61 years, in contrast to the meanage of 77 years in our study. Despite these limitations, our study has several key strengths. We consecutively identified and followed all eli-gible patients from the first day of warfarin to ensurecomplete capture of adverse events. Warfarin managementwas provided by an experienced staff who worked in along-established and well-organized clinic. We were able todirectly ascertain use of aspirin, an important and oftenunderreported confounder because of its over-the-counterstatus. Of the 472 patients, 32% were /H1135080 years of age,which constitutes the largest proportion of patients in this age group represented in a prospective real-world study of AF. Implications for Management of Anticoagulation in the Elderly Patient In our study, patients at highest risk of stroke also experi- enced most of the bleeding, which illustrates the clinicalcomplexity of these patients. Because cardioembolic strokesare associated with a 30-day mortality of 24% and significantdisability among those who survive, 30,31 decisions not to prescribe warfarin for patients in this high-risk group shouldbe largely influenced by hemorrhagic outcomes that are equalin magnitude to the irreversible sequelae of an ischemicstroke and not indiscriminate comparison of stroke rates toaggregate rates of bleeding. The rate of intracranial hemor-rhage in our study was 2.5% (95% CI 1.1 to 4.7) and 1.7% forintracerebral hemorrhage. Strategies to decrease this risk needto be aggressively sought and implemented. Control of bloodpressure has been shown to significantly reduce this risk. 32 The benefit of the addition of aspirin to warfarin for cardio-vascular disease needs to be rigorously defined and justi- fied. 33-35 Recent guidelines advise against this combination for older patients with AF and stable coronary disease.36 Interventions to reduce falls are important as these patientsexperience higher rates of intracranial hemorrhage, 2.8%(95% CI 1.9 to 4.1). 37,38Although use of lower INR targets has been suggested to offset bleeding risk, this strategy hasnot been shown to decrease hemorrhage. 31,36,39-41 An INR interval of 2.0 to 2.5 in theory seems like a rational compro-mise, but this degree of precision would be difficult toachieve in practice given warfarin's variable dose re-TABLE 4.

Further research ofage-related vasculopathies that predispose to intracerebralhemorrhage is needed. 33,39,44-46 A reduction of the risk of extracranial hemorrhage is critically important as these eventsare associated with significant morbidity and often precipitatetermination of therapy. Thresholds for discontinuation ofwarfarin may differ among physicians, patients, and familiesand thus warrant further study. 47Our findings also highlight the need for continued research into the mechanisms of AFand precipitants of thrombus formation, insights that mayelucidate novel pathways for stroke prevention without theattendant risk of hemorrhage. 48 Conclusions Published rates of major hemorrhage derived from youngernoninception cohorts underestimate the bleeding that occursin clinical practice. Higher rates of bleeding and short-termtolerability likely contribute to the reported underutilizationof warfarin among elderly patients with AF. Stroke preven-tion among the highest-risk patients remains a challenge.Given the aging of the population, stroke prevention in AF isa pressing health concern.

Concerns exist that published rates of hemorrhage may not reflect real-world practice. Few patients /H1135080 years of age were enrolled in trials, and studies of prevalent use largely reflect a warfarin-tolerant subset. We sought to define the tolerability of warfarinamong an elderly inception cohort with atrial fibrillation. Consecutive patients /H1135065 years of age who started warfarin were identified and followed for 1 year. Study outcomes included major hemorrhage, time to termination of warfarin, and reasonfor discontinuation. Of 472 patients enrolled, 32% were /H1135080 years of age, and 91% had /H113501 stroke risk factor. The cumulative incidence of major hemorrhage for patients /H1135080 years of age was 13.1 per 100 person-years and 4.7 for those /H1102180 years of age (P/H110050.009). Despite trial-level anticoagulation control, we found that the first 90 days of warfarin, age /H1135080 years, and international normalized ratio (INR) /H113504.0 were each associated with increased risk of hemorrhage. Within the first year, 26% of patients /H1135080 years of age stopped taking warfarin; perceived safety issues accounted for 81% of these. Rates of major hemorrhage and warfarin termination were highest among patients with CHADS 2scores (an acronym for congestive heart failure, hypertension, age /H1135075, diabetes mellitus, and prior stroke or transient ischemic attack) of /H113503. Rates of hemorrhage derived from younger noninception cohorts underestimate the bleeding that occurs in real-worldpractice. This finding, coupled with the short-term tolerability of warfarin, likely contributes to its underutilization. Strokeprevention among elderly patients with atrial fibrillation remains a challenging and pressing health concern.

Felson, MD, MPH Background: Uncertainty exists regarding the optimal workup of patients with suspected osteomyelitis of the foot, many of whom have diabetes mellitus. We con-ducted a meta-analysis to determine the diagnostic testperformance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) forosteomyelitis of the foot and compared this perfor-mance with that of technetium Tc 99m bone scanning,plain radiography, and white blood cell studies. Methods: We searched MEDLINE (from 1966 to week 3 of June 2006) and EMBASE (from 1980 to week 3 of June2006) for English-language studies in which adults sus-pected of having osteomyelitis of the foot or ankle wereevaluated by MRI. We then extracted data using a stan-dard form derived from the Cochrane Methods Group. Tosummarize the performance of diagnostic tests, we usedthe summary receiver operating characteristic curve analy-sis, which relies on the calculation of the diagnostic oddsratio (DOR). We also examined subsets of studies de-fined by the presence or absence of particular design flawsor populations.Results: Sixteen studies met inclusion criteria. In all stud- ies combined, the DOR for MRI was 42.1 (95% confi- dence interval, 14.8-119.9), and the specificity at a 90%sensitivity cut point was 82.5%. The DOR did not varygreatly among subsets of studies. In studies in which adirect comparison could be made with other technolo-gies, the DOR for MRI was consistently better than thatfor bone scanning (7 studies\u2014149.9 vs 3.6), plain radi-ography (9 studies\u201481.5 vs 3.3), and white blood cellstudies (3 studies\u2014120.3 vs 3.4). Conclusions: We found that MRI performs well in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis of the foot and ankle and canbe used to rule in or rule out the diagnosis. Magnetic reso-nance imaging performance was markedly superior to thatof technetium Tc 99m bone scanning, plain radiogra-phy, and white blood cell studies. Arch Intern Med. 2007;167:125-132 OSTEOMYELITIS OF THE FOOT and ankle is the primary or secondary reason for75 000 hospitalizations inthe United States each year. 1By far the most common group at risk is persons with diabetes mellitus. In termsof diagnostic evaluations, history and rou-tine laboratory tests, including the eryth-rocyte sedimentation rate, are not particu-larly informative. 2,3Although bone biopsy serves as a gold standard diagnostic test andis generally safe, the fear of introducing in-fection and the need for a surgical practi-tioner to perform the biopsy make devel- opment of diagnostic algorithms usingnoninvasive imaging strategies attractive. Plain radiography is the traditional and often the initial modality used for evalu-ating bone infections in the foot. Radio-graphic changes are often not visible un-til 2 to 4 weeks after onset of infection,accounting in part for the low sensitivityof plain radiography. 4-6The specificity of plain radiography tends to be higher than its sensitivity but can be compromised byposttraumatic reactions, nonspecific per-iosteal reactions as seen in chronic venousstasis, and most commonly Charcot os-teoarthropathy. Charcot osteoarthrop-athy, or Charcot foot, is a disruption in footarchitecture that results from micro-trauma to an insensate foot. It is often in-distinguishable from Bone scanning with technetium Tc 99m [ diphosphonate can detect early changes of osteomyelitis but suffersfrom lack of specificity. White blood cell (WBC) scanning, usually with indium In111, is more specific but lacks sensitivity. 5 In addition, WBC scanning requires the in-convenient and time-consuming process ofdrawing and incubating patient blood be-fore reinjecting and obtaining images.

Accurate estimates of MRI test per- formance for osteomyelitis of the footare difficult to establish. Most stud-ies have reported on small cohorts,combined persons with suspected os-teomyelitis of the foot and those withsuspected osteomyelitis of other bodysites, included persons both with andwithout diabetes, and left unstated theprevalence of Charcot foot. Studieshave drawn different conclusionsabout the value of MRI alone (orcompared with other technologies)and have reported vastly different es-timates of diagnostic specificity (0%-100%). Previous systematic re-views 8-10were limited by the number of publications they analyzed or thelack of foot-specific information. We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of the test perfor-mance of MRI for the diagnosis ofosteomyelitis of the foot and ankle.We then conducted subset analy-ses to explore the reason for vari-ability among included studies. Wealso compared the accuracy of MRIwith 99mTc bone scanning, plain radiography, and WBC scanning. METHODS STUDY IDENTIFICATION We searched MEDLINE (from 1966 to week 3 of June 2006) and EMBASE (from1980 to week 3 of June 2006) for English-language articles. (The complete searchstrategy is available from the authors onrequest.) We also searched the bibliog-raphies of included studies and asked spe-cialists within the fields of surgery andradiology to recommend citations. STUDY SELECTION We included studies that evaluated thediagnostic test performance of MRI inadult patients suspected of having os-teomyelitis of the foot or ankle or whohad foot infection and were systemati-cally examined for osteomyelitis. Spe-cifically, studies were enrolled when in-formation from the usual diagnosticperformance 2 /H110032 table (index diag- nostic test result positive or negative vstrue disease state present or absent)could be extracted about discrete footand ankle cases, when 80% or more ofthe patients were 16 years or older, andwhen at least one site with the diseaseand one without were identified by thereference standard (eg, bone biopsy).Two authors (A.K. and S.P.) evaluatedeach study for inclusion, and a third au-thor (D.T.F.) refereed ties. STUDY EXTRACTION AND QUALITY ASSESSMENT Once studies were selected, we used a dataextraction instrument derived from theCochrane Methods Group checklist onSystematic Review of Screening andDiagnostic Tests. 11Two independent re- viewers (A.K. and S.P.) extracted data thatpertained to study population character-istics. The prevalence of diabetes in eachstudy was noted. To understand better thequality of the sensitivity and specificityestimates reported in each study, we alsoextracted information about blinding andthe type of reference standard used. Spe-cifically, we calculated the frequency thata bone biopsy-based reference standardwas used to determine or exclude osteo-myelitis. For a positive disease determi-nation, positive histologic analysis or cul-ture results (however it was determinedby the study authors) from a bone speci-men were recorded. For the negative ref-erence standard, we recorded the percent-age of patients in whom osteomyelitis wasexcluded by negative histologic analysisresults (however it was determined by theauthors). If an individual study charac-teristic was not explicitly documented,no determination was made regarding thestudy status and a \"not specified\" labelwas assigned to the study for that char-acteristic. No attempt was made to contact study authors except to deter-mine whether the same patients wereenrolled more than once by authorswith multiple publications. COMPARISON OF DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING TESTS We extracted data on the diagnostic per-formance of bone scan, plain radiogra-phy, and WBC studies if a 2 /H110032 diag- nostic performance table could bederived from a study that was already in-cluded for its MRI data. DATA SYNTHESIS AND ANALYSIS For each study, we constructed a 2 /H110032 contingency table that consisted of true-positive, false-positive, false-negative, andtrue-negative results according to the ref-erence standard used in each case. Wethen calculated the sensitivity and speci-ficity in the usual fashion and the diag-nostic odds ratio (DOR), as determinedby the formula (true positive nega- tive)/(false positive /H11003false negative).

This method hasbeen described before. 12,13We repeated this analysis in 13 subsets that repre-sented different study populations (eg, lowor unspecified prevalence of Charcot foot)and the presence or absence of designflaws (eg, no blinding). COMPARISON OF DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING TESTS We compared the head-to-head test per-formance of MRI with 3 other imagingtests. Because we had collected data onall MRI diagnostic studies, we evaluatedthese other technologies compared with MRI, which was our focus in this study.We included only studies in which 1 ofthe 3 diagnostic modalities was com-pared with MRI. To make comparisons,we used the same summary receiver op-erating characteristic method men-tioned earlier. In certain studies not ev-ery patient underwent each test beingcompared, perhaps because a diagnosiswas reached when the patient under-went the first diagnostic test, making thenext one unnecessary. To account for thisbias, we also measured the performanceof the subset of studies in which all (ornearly all) patients underwent both di- agnostic tests being compared. All sta-tistical procedures were performed us- ing SAS statistical software, version 9.1.3(SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). RESULTS Our search strategy yielded 2070 titles with and without abstracts. Oneauthor (A.K.) reviewed them and re-quested 110 articles for full-text re-view.

If each patient had 1 site suggestive of osteomyelitis, the number of sites would equal the number of patients. Because the included studies typically did not document performance estimates at the patient level, we calculated the summary estimate of performance at the level of the site.Later, we examined the summary estimate in a subset of studies in which the number of multiple sites for the same patient was low or nil. In addition, the numberof sites listed corresponds to that for the entire study. Individual imaging tests may not have been performed in all cases.

Although this was notan a priori exclusion criterion, we be-lieved the study was not consistentwith the intent of our analysis. Wechose to provide a summary esti-mate of the performance of MRI in atypical patient population at riskrather than one in which the popu-lation is artificially enriched withproblem cases, and so the study waseliminated from analysis. Eleven of the 16 studies involved almost exclusively diabetic patients. Nine of 16 recruited patients pro-spectively (ie, study authors en-rolled patients before any imaging tests were recorded). Most studies didnot specify or standardize the exactreason for diagnostic suspicion of os-teomyelitis. In many cases, it was im-plied by the presence of a compli-cated or infected foot ulcer. Indeed,foot ulcer was required or uni-formly present in 6 studies. In mostinstances, the number of cases withCharcot disease was not reported. Most studies judged an MRI scan to be positive by the same criterion: a lesion in the bone that showed fo-cally decreased marrow signal in-tensity in T1-weighted images andTable 2.

Most authorsreported results according to thenumber of sites with potential os-teomyelitis or number of at-riskbones imaged. We calculated a ra-tio of the number of patients to num-ber of sites and compared MRI per-formance in studies with low andhigh ratios. Magnetic resonance im-aging sensitivity was usually highand ranged from 77% to 100%; MRIspecificity ranged from 40% to 100%. Among all studies, the DOR for MRI was 42.1 (95% confidence in-terval [CI], 14.8-119.9). The speci-ficity cut pointof 90% sensitivity was 82.5%. Wepresent the curve for diagnostic per-formance in Figure 2 . We found no substantial or statistically signifi-cant differences in estimates of MRIdiagnostic test performance amongsubsets of studies (available from theauthors on request). The number ofstudies in certain subgroups subgroup with Charcotprevalence with small num- patients represented in each.Small numbers in subsets prohibitrobust conclusions. We thereforeonly discuss the subsets for which8 or more studies were available foranalysis. Studies that did not usebone histologic analysis to excludedisease tended to have higher per-formance (DOR, 67.4; 95% CI, 18.3-248.0). Studies published in reported lower perfor-mance (DOR, 25.3; 95% CI, 5.5-116.8). Most of the later studies hada prospective design and docu-mented assessment of MRI blindedto other results. COMPARISON OF DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING TESTS We compared the diagnostic perfor-mance of 4 technologies in studiesthat compared MRI with another im-aging test ( Table 3 ). We found 7 studies that directly compared MRIwith 99mTc bone scanning, all using the triple-phase technique. Mag-netic resonance imaging perfor-mance was markedly Figure 3 ). At the 90% sensitivity cut point, the specificity for MRI was98% compared with 28.5% for tech-netium. Similarly, in 9 studies thatcompared plain radiography MRI outperformed plain radi-ography compared with DOR, 3.3; 95%CI, 2.2-5.0). 3 studies in whichMRI was compared WBC study,the DOR for MRI was demonstratedthat MRI performs in the diag-nosis of osteomyelitis of the foot andankle in adults. Good diagnostic per-formance was consistent across asubset of studies of different de-signs and different patients. More-over, MRI outperformed techne-tium, plain radiography, and WBCstudies. Although the performance of MRI was strong, our review revealedmany flaws in the published litera-ture concerning imaging tests for os-teomyelitis in the foot or ankle. Fewstudies prospectively followed up acohort of patients in which assess-ment of MRI was blinded to otherimaging tests and reference stan-dard results, and few verified the di-agnosis in all cases with a biopsy. Al-though the estimate of performancedid not change substantially withinstudy subsets, the relatively smallnumber of studies did not permit ex-ploring the combined effect of mul-tiple design issues. In addition, the frequency of Charcot foot was not typically docu-mented in our studies. Performanceestimates could vary significantlyamong studies of varying preva-lence of Charcot foot. In the 13 stud-ies in which prevalence was not docu-mented, the prevalence of Charcotfoot was probably low. However, indiabetic patients with coexistent dia-betic foot infection, prevalence isuncertain. Although it may be un-common in the general diabeticTable 3.

All rights reserved. at Boston University, on August 8, 2011 www.archinternmed.com Downloaded from population, Charcot foot is likely much more prevalent among pa-tients with peripheral neuropathy. 32 Given that the management strate-gies for Charcot foot and osteomy-elitis are vastly different (offloadingand contact casting vs long-term an-tibiotics), making an accurate diag-nosis is essential. This meta-analysis has 2 major implications. First, this study con-firms that MRI is a strong test to aidin both confirming and excluding os-teomyelitis of the foot. Using theclinically relevant cut point of 90%sensitivity, the positive likelihood ra-tio is 5.1 and the negative likeli-hood ratio is 0.12. Assuming a pre-test probability of 50% (not far fromthe 55% calculated from all stud-ies), a patient with a positive MRIwould have an 84% chance of hav-ing the diagnosis ( Table 4 ). If any other features or examination find-ings favor the diagnosis of osteomy-elitis, such as substantial depth of ul-cer or positive probe to bone, theaddition of a positive MRI virtuallyclinches the diagnosis. A negativeMRI study in our baseline hypotheti-cal patient results in a posttest prob-ability of 11%. Combined with ab-sence of substantial ulcer depth ora negative probe to bone, MRI ef-fectively rules out osteomyelitis. The second major implication is that there should be a diminished useof 99mTc bone scanning in the diag- nosis of osteomyelitis of the foot. Al-though bone scanning has been pro-posed for ruling out the disease(given its purported high sensitiv-ity), the lack of for ev- ery 100 patients subjected to bonescanning, 12 of 13 with a negativeresult would have the diagnosis cor-rectly excluded (negative predic-tive value, 91%), but only 24 of 87with a positive result would be cor-rectly identified as having osteo-myelitis (positive predictive value,27%). A diagnostic algorithm thatincludes bone scanning wouldthereby result in the ordering of nu- merous second imaging tests orbiopsies. At a lower prevalence ofosteomyelitis (eg, 5%-15%), 99mTc scanning may successfully rule outdisease (Table However, clini-cians often underestimate the preva-lence of osteomyelitis, particularlyin patients with a diabetic foot in-fection; this finding suggests that anassumption of low prevalence maybe risky. 34In addition, MRI permits detection of deep collections of pusor necrotic tissue and visualizationof foot anatomy, which helps the sur-geon plan surgery when indicated.The Infectious Disease Society ofAmerica has already recognized thatMRI is the preferred advanced im-aging test for suspected osteomyeli-tis but recommends performing se-rial plain radiography beforeordering an MRI. 35We are unaware of any study that has formally evalu-ated serial plain radiography vs earlyMRI.

In this meta-analysis, we chose to focus on osteomyelitis of the foot andankle, because disease of the foot andankle is a distinct entity that affectsa particular patient population, thatis, patients with diabetes and/or pe-ripheral neuropathy. We did notanalyze non-English-language ar-ticles. We are unaware of any evi-dence of bias in English languagestudies that assessed technology. We did not exclude studies on the basis of date of publication or ad-vent of innovation or variation in in-terpretation of MRI. Although MRIevaluation of osteomyelitis hasevolved, with gadolinium now oftenused, subset analysis based on gado-linium use did not reveal any sub-stantial variation in performance. Sec-ondary diagnostic signs (such ascortical breaks) appeared to be incor-porated into the diagnostic algo-rithm for osteomyelitis more fre-quently in recent publications.Ahmadi et al 31recently published a retrospective analysis of additional cri-teria for use in assessing osteomyeli-tis superimposed on Charcot foot, butthis work is still largely untested. As for the comparison of diag- nostic tests, we focused on compar-ing MRI with plain radiography andradionuclide scanning, making 3 dis-crete head-to-head comparisons withMRI. A recent review by the HealthTechnology Assessment group sup-ports this approach, suggesting thatheterogeneity of diagnostic test com-parisons will be less of a problem inhead-to-head comparisons. 36We did not analyze other imaging modali-ties, such as combined bone scan-ning and or fewerstudies directly compared them toMRI. We did not compare the per-formance of biopsy with MRI. A bi-opsy affords information regardingthe exact pathogen responsible forinfection, something that imagingtests cannot do. According to 2006 figures, Medi- care reimburses $288 for a 3-phasebone scan and $416 for a lower-extremity MRI without contrast($451 with contrast). 37,38We calcu- lated these values on the basis of howour center bills Medicare, which isthe sum of the reimbursement to ourfacility when providing the serviceto an outpatient and the reimburse-ment to the radiologist interpret-ing the film (the professional com-ponent alone). For an inpatient,Medicare reimburses the relevant di-agnosis-related code; therefore,unique MRI payment information isnot available. Given the small dif-ference in cost (which is approxi-mated by Medicare reimburse-ment) between MRI and 99mTc bone scan and the large difference in di-agnostic performance between thesetechnologies, MRI would be morecost-effective except when the prob-ability of disease was low. Localavailability and cost of each test mustalso be considered when selectingthe appropriate test. Formal deci-sion modeling is needed to fullycharacterize the place of MRI in thediagnostic algorithm of osteomyeli-tis of the foot and ankle. In summary, MRI has a strong performance in the diagnosis of os-teomyelitis of the foot and ankle inadults. It outperforms 3-phase 99mTc bone scanning and plain radiogra-phy. The role of bone scanning isprobably eclipsed by that of MRI ex-cept in cases in which MRI is con-traindicated or the probability of dis-ease is low. Accepted for Publication: Septem- ber 15, 2006.

Identification of risk factors could lead to interven\u00ad tions to reduce rehospitalization. The objective of the study was to determine if physical and mental health, substance abuse, and social support are risk factors for rehospitalization. Method: This was a prospective cohort study in an inner-city population conducted from September 2002 to September 2004. Participants included 144 adult inpatients with at least I hospi\u00ad tal admission in the past 6 months. Measurements included age, length of stay, number of admissions in the past year, and medical comorbidity as well as measures of depression, alcohol and drug abuse, social support, and health-related quality of life. The outcome studied was the rehospitalization status of participants within 90 days of the index hospitalization. Results: The mean age of the subjects was 54.8 years; 48% were black and 78% spoke English as a primary language. Subjects were admitted a mean of 2.5 times in the year before the index admission. Sixty-four patients (44%) were subsequently rehospitalized within 90 days after the index admission. In bivariate analysis, rehospitalized patients had more prior admissions (median of 3.0 vs. 2.0 admissions, p =.002), greater medical comorbidity (mean Charlson Comorbidity Index score of 2.6 vs. 2.0, p = .04), and poorer physical functional status (mean SF-12 physical component score of 31.5 vs. 36.2, p = .03). A logistic regression model, including prior admissions in the last year, comorbidity, physical functional status, and depression, showed that depression tripled the odds of rehospitalization (odds ratio =3.3,95% CI=1.2 to 9.3). This model had fair accuracy in identifying patients at greatest risk for rehospitalization (c statistic = 0.72). Conclusions: Hospitalized patients with a history of prior hospitalization within 6 months who screen positive for depression are 3 times more likely to be rehospitalized within 90 days in this relatively high-risk population. Screening during hospitalization for depressive symptoms may identify those at risk for rehospitalization. (Prim Care Companion J Clin Psychiatry 2007;9:256-262) !

By one estimate, rehos\u00ad pitalizations account for as much as half of all hospitaliza\u00ad tions.' In 2003, national health care expenditures in the United States on all hospitalizations were $516 billion,\" so rehospitalization might account for over $250 billion of U.S. national health care expenditures annually. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that in 1999,4 states spent $1.9 billion in 6 months on rehospi\u00ad talization.' Therefore, even a small reduction in rehospi\u00ad talization could have an important impact on health care services provision and quality. Some successes in preventing rehospitalization in spe\u00ad cific disorders such as congestive heart failure have been demonstrated, but strategies to prevent rehospitalization have had limited success in adult inpatients with other di\u00ad agnoses.\" For an intervention aimed at reducing rehospi\u00ad talization to be practical and cost-effective, there needs to be a reliable means of targeting those patients who are at high risk. Known risk factors for rehospitalization in\u00ad clude advanced age, specific diagnoses (such as conges\u00ad tive heart failure), history of prior admission, length of PrimCare Companion J ClinPsychiatry 2007;9(4) 256 stay, and some measure of the severity of the illness.:\" However, these factors that are readily available from ad\u00ad minisuutive databases explain only a small amount of the variance in rehospitalization. Predictors of rehospitaliza\u00ad tion in urban. underserved populations are even less well defined. Efforts to reduce rehospitalization in these popu\u00ad lations deserve particular attention because there is evi\u00ad dence that people of lower socioeconomic status cxperi\u00ad cnce higher rehospitalization rates.'

METHOD Study Setting This study was conducted on an aduIt inpatient service that admits from ,I consortium of 15 community health centers (CHCs) comprising the Boston HealthNel to Bos\u00ad Ion Medical Center (BMC), ,HI inner-city, academic mcdi\u00ad cal center located ill Boston.

The study was conducted from September 2002 to September 2004. The institutional review board of Boston University Med\u00ad ical Center approved the study. Study Design This was a prospective cohort study. The index admis\u00ad sion was the hospitalization during which the patient was enrolled in the study, Trained staff members screened in\u00ad patients for elig ihility. Patients were eligible if they (I) were admitted to the Boston HealthNet medical inpatient service, (2) were over 18years of age. 0) had a history of at least I hospitalization in the 6-lllonth period before the index admission, (4) had an assigned primary care physi\u00ad cian \\PCP) at I of the CHCs. (5) were willing to be rehos\u00ad pitalized if indicated, and (0) were admitted from a non\u00ad institutionalized setting. Patients were excluded if (I) they expressed that they were unwilfing or unahle to keep appointments with their PCP. (2) rehospitalization was planned (e.g., for diagnostic test or procedure) at the time of enrollment, or (3) they were previously enrolled. Sub\u00ad jects were approached for study enrollment at each ad\u00ad mission even if they declined participation at a previous admission. Data Collection After obtaining informed consent, research staff mcrn\u00ad bel'S collected demographic data and informauon about Depression and Rehospitalization known risk factors for rehospitalization, including age, length of stay of the index admission. and number of ad\u00ad missions in the year before the index admission. and cal\u00ad culated the Charlson Comorbidity Index score!\" from re\u00ad view of the hospital record. Research staff then conducted a face-to-face structured interview with the subject that in\u00ad cluded administering the following validated instruments, Nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9\" uses a 4-point Likert scale and a standard scoring algorithm to diagnose major depression: the screen has been used in numerous studies. The PHQ-9 was developed as a l-stagc, self-report version of the depres\u00ad sion section of the previously validated Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders instrument.':' The PHQ-() demonstrates a sensitivity of 88111 and a specificity of XlVi<; for major depression (as compared with mental health professional's diagnoses as the gold standard 1. II Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). The AUDIT,I \\ which may be self-administered or ad\u00ad ministered by an interviewer, consists of 10questions and takes approximately -' minutes to complete. The first R questions refer to alcohol-related issues over the prior year, and the final 2 include information about previous years. The AUDIT has been extensively researched and validated, demonstrating high correlation with other fre\u00ad quently used instruments such as the Michigan Alcohol\u00ad ism Screening Test.1\\ Using the traditional cutoff of 8. the test has sensitivity for alcohol abuse or dependence (as defined by DSM-III-R criteria), ranging from 7W,{ to 100'k. Specificity values have been lower, ranging from 25';;, to 96Q,. Of note, the AUDIT has been validated among adults at an inner-city medical clinic serving a population similar to that of BMC'. In that population, the instrument was shown to be 96',1\" sensitive for current al\u00ad cohol abuse Or dependence and to accurately distinguish between current and former alcohol-related problems.\" The AUDIT has been used in numerous research projects. including a recent study of a substance abuse treatment system':' accessed through the emergency department at BMC'. Given extensive lise in populations such as ours and ease of administration, we chose the AUDIT over other screening instruments. 1J I' ttl-item Drug Abuse Screening Test (lJAST\u00b7JO). The DAST-I01 \" identifies drug use problems using a IO-itelll screen, with scores greater than -' suggesting a moderate level of drug-related problems worthy of further investi\u00ad gatjon. The original DAST 2S-item instrument demon\u00ad strated excellent content and construct validity and in\u00ad ternal consistency ranging from .86 to .95, with an 85'/<, overall accuracy in diagnosing drug abuse or dependence (according to DSM-m criteria), as compared with the Di\u00ad agnostic Interview Schedule. Both 20-item and IO-itcllI versions of the DAST have been developed. The DAST-20 correlates almost perfectly with the original DAST. and the DAST-IO correlates highly with the 20-item version 257 Kartha et al. (r == .98).17 The DAST-l 0, due to its similarity in structure, has been frequently used with the AUDIT to screen for drug and alcohol-related problems. 16 Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire (NSSQ). The NSSQI8 is used to measure multiple dimensions of social support, with the mean (SD) score for the normative popu\u00ad lation equal to 201.9 (95.9) and higher scores suggesting greater social support. The NSSQ has good internal reli\u00ad ability (correlations ranging from .69 to .98) and test-retest reliability (correlations ranging from .86 to .92).18 The test yields 3 scores (total functional support, total network sup\u00ad port, and total loss). The total functional support score was used in this study. The NSSQ has been used in studies of low-income populations and in numerous studies to iden\u00ad tify correlations between social support and rehospitaliza\u00ad tion among with ischemic heart disease.\":\" Short Form-l2 Health Survey (SF-l2). The SF_1220 was developed as a valid abbreviation of the widely used Short Form-36 questionnaire that was designed to accu\u00ad rately measure the physical and mental components of health-related quality of life. Administration of the survey yields 2 scores: the physical component summary (PCS) and the mental component summary (MCS). These scores are scaled on a range of 0 to 100 designed to produce mean scores of 50 and standard deviations of 10 in a representa\u00ad tive sample of the U.S. population; higher scores suggest greater functional status. The 2 summary scores offer ex\u00ad cellent reliability as measured by the internal consistency method (PCS == 89% and MCS == 86%).20 Independent Variables Age, length stay, number of prior admissions, Charlson Comorbidity Index, NSSQ functional scale, and SF-12 PCS and MCS were characterized as continuous variables. The PHQ-9 (major depression), AUDIT (score ?: 6), and DAST-lO (score z 3) were dichotomized using standardized scoring systems. Data Dependent variables. The outcome studied was the re\u00ad hospitalization status within 90 days of the index hospital\u00ad ization. Rehospitalization refers to the first hospitalization that occurred for any reason within 90 days after discharge from the index admission. Rehospitalization was deter\u00ad mined by review of the hospital database that is available for all patients. To determine if subjects were rehospital\u00ad ized at another hospital, we contacted all subjects by tele\u00ad phone. If we were unable to contact subjects after 5 tele\u00ad phone calls, then we contacted the alternate contacts, whose information was obtained during study enrollment. Statistical analyses. Analysis included (1) comparison of subjects who agreed to enroll in the study versus those who refused participation, (2) bivariate comparison of baseline characteristics of rehospitalized subjects versus those not rehospitalized, and (3) bivariate comparison of risk factors for rehospitalization comparing those subjects rehospitalized and not rehospitalized. In these analyses, t test, X2 test, Fisher exact test, and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used where appropriate, with a p value :5; .05 used as level of significance. The final analysis included a series of multivariate logistic regression analyses to determine the odds of re\u00ad hospitalization after controlling for all independent vari\u00ad ables. We used a 3-stage process to develop our logistic models. Model I includes risk factors known to be associ\u00ad ated with rehospitalization (age, length of index hospital stay, number of hospital admissions in the past year, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score). Model 2 includes all of the psychosocial and functional scales that were hy\u00ad pothesized to contribute to rehospitalization, which in\u00ad cluded the PHQ-9 (major depression), PHQ-9 (anxiety), AUDIT (alcohol abuse), DAST-IO (drug abuse), NSSQ (social support), and SF-12 PCS and MCS (physical and mental components of health-related quality of life). Fi\u00ad nally, model 3 incorporates independent variables found to be related to rehospitalization at the p == .05 level of sig\u00ad nificance in either the bivariate analysis or in model I or model 2. This model includes the number of hospital admissions in the prior year and Charlson Comorbidity Index, SF-12 PCS, and PHQ-9 (major depression) scores. Model 3 is the preferred model, as it provides the most conservative assessment of risk factor performance. Model performance was assessed by the concordance statistic (c statistic) for discriminative ability (refers to the ability to distinguish high-risk subjects from low-risk subjects). A value of 0.5 indicates no discriminatory power, whereas a c statistic of 1.0 indicates perfect dis\u00ad crimination. Model calibration (refers to whether the pre\u00ad dicted probabilities agree with the observed probabilities) was assessed by the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of\u00ad fit test. Lack of fit in our models was considered statisti\u00ad cally significant if the p value was less than .05. All analy\u00ad ses were done using SAS version 8.02 software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, N.C.). RESULTS Sample Characteristics Of 204 eligible subjects who were approached and asked to participate in the study, 144 (71%) were enrolled and 60 (29%) refused. The age, gender, length of index hospital stay, and number of prior admissions in the past year did not differ among enrolled subjects when com\u00ad pared with those who chose not to participate (Table 1). Eligible subjects who previously refused were reap\u00ad proached at each admission. Enrolled subjects were ad\u00ad mitted a mean of 2.5 times in the year before the index admission.

For all 144 enrolled subjects, the mean age was 54.8 years, 49% were black, 45% were male, and 78% spoke English as a primary language. Nearly all subjects were insured through commercial in\u00ad surance, Medicare, or Medicaid. The remainder were ei\u00ad ther self-payor covered by the Massachusetts system that provides care to those who otherwise lack coverage. Of 144 subjects enrolled, 64 (44%) had at least 1 re\u00ad hospitalization in the 90 days after discharge from the indexadmission (median =1.0, mean =1.8, range, 1--6). While there were no statistically significant differences, rehospitalized subjects tended to be white, married, and English speaking compared with those not rehospitalized. Nearly half of rehospitalized subjects were originally hospitalized for metabolic diseases (hypoglycemia, hy\u00ad perglycemia, ketoacidosis, renal failure, hyponatremia, and dehydration), arrhythmias, asthma, chest pain, and congestive heart failure. In subjects who were not rehos\u00ad pitalized, the most common diagnoses included asthma, chest pain, cellulitis, and congestive heart failure. The group of patients rehospitalized within 90 days was admitted frequently (median of 2 admissions in the past 6 months) and had a high degree of medical and psychosocial risk: 27% met criteria for major depression on the PHQ-9, 18% were at risk of hazardous drinking (AUDIT score ~ 6), and 6% were at risk of drug-related problems (DAST-lO score ~ 3). The rehospitalized sam\u00ad ple had poor social support (median score of 71 on the NSSQ, while a score of 201.9 was average for a norma\u00ad tive population) and reported poor physical health (mean score of 34.2 on the SF-12 PCS, while the mean score of the U.S. population is 50) and poor mental health (mean score of 41.8 on the SF-12 MCS, while the mean score of the U.S. population is 50).

The odds of rehospitalization were again significantly greater in subjects who screened positive for major depression (OR =3.3,95% CI =1.20 to 9.25). For models 1,2, and 3, the c statistics were 0.66, 0.70, and 0.72, respectively, and the p values for the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness\u00ad of-fit test were 0.58, 0.15, and 0.35, respectively. DISCUSSION In patients who had a history of hospitalizations in the 6 months prior to the index hospitalization, we found that a positive screen for major depression at admission tripled the odds of being rehospitalized within 90 days of dis\u00ad charge among adult inpatients in an urban academic medi\u00ad cal center. While we await further study in randomized in\u00ad tervention trials, clinicians should consider screening for and treating depression in their frequently readmitted in\u00ad patients in an effort to reduce medical rehospitalization. Our findings are supported by the few studies that have examined the association between depression and rehos\u00ad pitalization. A study of medical and surgical inpatients found that depressed patients spent twice as many days rehospitalized over a 4-year period.\" A Swiss study in elderly inpatients found that patients with depressive symptoms had higher inpatient service utilization over a Prim Care Companion J Clin Psychiatry 2007;9(4) 260 6-month period.f Similarly, a case-control study of el\u00ad derly patients in a Medicare managed care plan found increased odds of unplanned rehospitalization within 30 days if patients had a history of depression (OR =3.2, 95% CI = 1.4 to 7.9).23 Taken together, our study adds to the literature indicating that depression is a powerful risk factor for rehospitalization. Depression is also associated with worse outcomes after myocardial infarction.\" In a prospective registry of myocardial infarction, depressive symptoms were measured in 1873 patients with the PHQ during hospitalization and 1 month after discharge. In this study, all categories of depression were associated with higher rehospitalization, more frequent angina, more physical limitations, and worse quality of life.\" Depression might lead to rehospitalization through a variety of mechanisms. The neuroendocrine changes seen in depression can worsen physical illness. Depression may impair health-related quality of life leading to lower thresholds for admission. Somatization may be misin\u00ad terpreted, thereby complicating diagnosis and manage\u00ad ment.\" Medication nonadherence among patients with mental health diagnoses could lead to rehospitalization.\" Finally, depressed patients might have a reduced social support network leading to increasing stress and wors\u00ad ening of symptoms, thereby lengthening time to recovery and necessitating rehospitalization.\" An array of clinical and administrative factors have been associated with rehospitalization including age, length of stay, number of prior hospital admissions, co\u00ad morbid medical illness, admitting diagnosis, male sex, white race, Medicaid coverage, single marital status, and laboratory data such as glycosylated hemoglobin.\" How\u00ad ever, these factors tend to explain very little of the vari\u00ad ation in rehospitalizations.\" Therefore, in this study, we explored the contributions of mental health, substance abuse, social support, and perceived health-related quality of life, which we proposed to be related to rehospitaliza\u00ad tion and which have been suggested in the medical litera\u00ad ture?S--30 Although much of the variability in rehospital\u00ad ization remains unexplained, these findings support our approach to combine psychosocial and functional deter\u00ad minants of rehospitalization to better understand these complex interactions. We were successful in identifying a group at high risk of rehospitalization (overall 44% were rehospitalized within 90 days of the index admission). Three factors might explain this finding: (I) the population enrolled had a high degree of medical and psychosocial comorbidities (27% screened positive for major depression, 18% for al\u00ad cohol abuse, and 6% for risk of drug abuse; many had poor social support and physical health); (2) we only en\u00ad rolled subjects who had been hospitalized in the last 6 months, a powerful risk factor for rehospitalizatiorr'\"; and (3) we reapproached subjects who had declined enroll\u00ad ment at prior admissions at each hospitalization, resulting Prim Care Companion J Clin Psychiatry 2007;9(4) Depression and Rehospitalization in a study group with a mean of 2.5 hospitalizations in the year before the index hospitalization. As a result of these 3 factors, we studied subjects at very high risk of rehospi\u00ad talization. While our inclusion criteria might somewhat limit the generalizability of our results, it is relevant to many hospitals that provide care to similar inner-city populations who are frequently hospitalized. Finally, while our data suggest that more prior admis\u00ad sions, greater length of stay, poorer physical functioning, anxiety disorders, and alcohol use are related to rehospi\u00ad talizations, we could not confirm our hypotheses regard\u00ad ing these factors in multivariate analysis. Interestingly, we did not find a relationship between social support and rehospitalization. It is possible that our subjects used their supports to facilitate health-seeking behavior leading to rehospitalization. Also, we used the functional support score of the NSSQ in our analyses. If the effect of social support is primarily from aspects of social support we did not analyze (network properties and recent losses), it is possible that we may not have fully accounted for the variance in rehospitalization explained by social support. A major strength of this study is its prospective design that permits us to describe both the magnitude and direc\u00ad tion of causal relationships between factors. This is in fa\u00ad vorable contrast to the retrospective designs that are used by a number of prior studies. Limitations of this study in\u00ad clude the modest enrollment rate of eligible subjects; however, the fact that age, gender, length of stay, and number of prior admissions did not differ between groups may suggest that subjects were not entirely dissimilar. Finally, we did not consider the quality of care received during the index admission, which has been associated with rehospitalization.\" Despite these limitations, we conclude that hospital\u00ad ized adults with a history of recent previous hospitaliza\u00ad tions who screen positive for major depression are at a 3 times greater risk of being rehospitalized within 90 days of discharge. Future randomized controlled trials de\u00ad signed to treat patients screening positive for major de\u00ad pression in an attempt to reduce rehospitalization should be undertaken. While we await further study in random\u00ad ized intervention trials, clinicians should consider screen\u00ad ing for and treating depression in their frequently read\u00ad mitted inpatients before discharge in an effort to reduce rehospitalization. ..

While adherence to ART has ~ been well studied, less is known about factors associated with discontinuation of ART. The aim of this study is to investigate o predictors of discontinuation of ART in HIV-infected patients with alcohol problems, focusing on their substance use and o depressive symptoms. The study cohort (n = 266) was prospectively assessed with biannual standardised interviews between 2001 and 2005. Four predictor variables (cocaine, heroin, heavy alcohol use and substantial depressive symptoms) were assessed six months prior to the outcome (ART discontinuation). Longitudinal logistic regression models examined the association between predictor variables and ART discontinuation adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, homelessness, CD4, HIV RNA and HIV Symptom alcohol use; and 40% had substantial depressive symptoms. Discontinuation occurred in 135 (17%) of the observations (n =743). In bivariate analyses, cocaine use, heroin use and depressive symptoms were significantly associated with ART discontinuation but heavy alcohol use was not. In the multivariable model, substantial depressive symptoms (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.66; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 2.65) but not cocaine (AOR = 1.28; 95%CI: 0.76, 2.16) or heroin use (AOR = 1.27 95%CI: 0.66, 2.44), remained significantly associated with ART discontinuation. Among HIV-infected adults with alcohol problems, depressive symptoms, but not substance use, predicted subsequent ART discontinuation. Recognition and treatment of depressive symptoms in this population may result in better maintenance of ART and its associated clinical benefits. Introduction Increasingly, researchers and health policy-makers are recognising the difficulty in translating medical treatment advances to vulnerable populations. Although mortality from HIV infection has declined with the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), patients with substance use disorders have benefited less (Lucas et aI., 2006). Since patients with intermittent use of ART have higher mortality rates (Hogg et al., 2002; Riley et aI., 2005), sustaining these drug regimens over long periods of time is one of the major challenges in the care of HIV-infected patients. Studies of predictors of ART discontinuation among populations with HIV and addictions are limited. The impact of injection drug use (IDU) is often evaluated by analysing subjects' HIV transrnis\u00adsion risk behavior (Chen et aI., 2003; D'Arminio et al., 2005; Mocroft et aI., 2005) and may assume that the impact of substance use is unaffected by its cessation. Evaluating IDU as a risk category does not account for the spectrum of use that may occur at different stages of a patient's addiction trajectory (McLellan et aI., 2000). The relationship between the use of specific drugs of abuse and discontinua\u00ad tion of ART also has received little attention (Li et aI., 2005; Yuan et aI., 2006) despite the spectrum of biological and behavioural effects caused by individual stimulants and depressants. Also, there has been limited examination of the impact of alcohol use on ART discontinuation despite the high prevalence of alcohol use disorders among HIV-infected persons (Conigliaro et al., 2003; Galvan et aI., 2002; Samet et al., 2004) and its association with suboptimal adherence (Braithwaite Correspondence: Theresa W. Kim, Section General Internal Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, 91 E. Concord Street, Ste. 200, Boston, MA 0248. E-mail: theresa.kim@bmc.org ISSN 10.1080/09540120701294245 1040 T. W Kim et al. o00 et aI., 2005; Samet et aI., 2004) and HIV disease o progression (Samet et aI., 2003). Furthermore,N studies examining addictions and ART use fre\u00ad ~ ro quently do not include information about depressive2 .0 symptoms (Kerr et aI., 2005; Riley et aI., 2005; YuanQ) U. et al., 2006). This is important because of the high LO oq- co-morbidity of substance use and mood disorders in T\"\"\" the general population (Grant et aI., 2004), which is ~ T\"\"\" even greater among HIV-infected patients (Galvan et al., 2003). The aim of this study is to investigate predictors of discontinuation of ART in HIV-infected patients with alcohol problems, focusing on their substance use and depressive symptoms. We hypothesised that active substance use (cocaine, heroin and heavy alcohol use) and depressive symptoms would each be associated with a greater likelihood of ART discontinuation. Methods Study design and population This study examines predictors of discontinuation of ART among subjects in the HIV-Longitudinal Inter\u00ad relationships of Viruses and Ethanol (HIV-LIVE) study. This was a prospective, observational cohort study of HIV-infected patients with past or current alcohol problems. Subjects were prospectively fol\u00ad lowed with biannual standardised interviews be\u00ad tween August 2001 and March 2005. The 400 subjects of the HIV-LIVE study were recruited from different sources including: (1) a previous cohort study (Samet et al., 2003) of people with HIV and alcohol problems (n =154; 38%); (2) the Diagnostic Evaluation Unit (Samet et al., 1995), an intake clinic for HIV-infected patients at Boston Medical Center (n = 88; 22%); (3) the HIV Primary Care and Specialty Clinics at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (n = 31; 8%); and (4) additional healthcare centres, homeless shelters, drug treat\u00ad ment programs, subject referrals and flyers (n = 127; 32%). Eligibility criteria for the HIV-LIVE study in\u00ad cluded: (1) documented HIV antibody by ELISA confirmed by Western Blot; (2) two or more affirmative responses to the CAGE alcohol screening questionnaire (Buchsbaum et aI., 1991) or co\u00ad investigator physician diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence; (3) ability to speak English or Spanish; and (4) at least one contact person who was likely to know their whereabouts. Exclusion criteria included: (1) scoring <21 on the 30-item Mini-Mental State Examination (Smith et aI., 2006); (2) trained inter\u00ad viewer assessment that the patient was incapable of comprehending informed consent or answering the interview questions; or (3) plans to move from the Boston area in the subsequent two years. Subjects were included in the analyses if they reported being on ART at any study interview (hereafter referred to as TN) and then returned six months later for the next scheduled interview (TN + 1) \u00b7 Data collection After enrolment, research associates interviewed subjects using a standardised instrument at baseline and biannually thereafter. For interviews conducted in Spanish, standardised scales in Spanish were used when available; the remainder of the questionnaire was translated from English into Spanish, back translated to check for accuracy and then corrected. CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA viral load measure\u00ad ments conducted as part of clinical care were recorded if within four months of the research interview. If they were not available through clinical care, blood samples were obtained and tested for these parameters. All subjects provided written informed consent prior to enrolment. The Institutional Review Boards of Boston University Medical Center and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center approved this study. Additional privacy protection was secured by the issuance of a Certificate of Confidentiality by the Department of Health and Human Services to protect subjects from release of their research data even under a court order or subpoena. Dependent variable We defined discontinuation of ART as either: (1) being off ART medications at TN + 1 (This was assessed with the question: 'Are you currently taking antiretroviral medications for HIV?'); or (2) stopping all ART medications for ~30 days between TN and TN + I' This second criterion was inel uded since some subjects who were taking ART medications on the day of the follow-up research interview (TN + I) may have stopped them for an extended period of time since the last interview. This criterion was assessed with the questions: 'Did you stop taking all of your HIV medications for more than a day during the past six months (not including switching or changing medications)?' and, for those answering affirmatively, asking about the number of days without ART. Main independent variables The main independent variables were: (1) heavy alcohol consumption over the previous month using the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Discontinuation ofART in patients with alcohol problems 1041 00 o o N e\u00adco ::J L... ..0 <ll u, 1.0 \"<t ~ ::c (ij' OJ ~ '0 U c .8 sn o Ee. >, CD \"0 <ll \"0 co .2 c ~ o o Alcoholism definition, which is more than 14 stan\u00ad dard drinks per week (or more than four drinks in a day) for men or more than seven drinks per week (or more than three drinks in a day) for women; past month alcohol consumption was assessed using a validated calendar method (Sobell, 1992); (2) any cocaine use in the past six months using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), Short Form (Kessler et a!., 1998); (3) any heroin use during the past six months using the CIDI; Short Form and (4) substantial depressive symptoms, defined as a score of ~ 23 on the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale (CES-D) (Radloff, 1977). This score indicates substantial depressive symptoms in patients with chronic medical conditions (Golub et a!., 2004). All main independent variables were modelled as dichotomous variables. To reduce the likelihood that we were measuring depressive symptoms rather than symptoms related to HIV infection, secondary analyses were per\u00ad formed using a modified version of the CES-D (lckovics et a!., 2001) removing somatic complaints (fatigue, anorexia, lack of energy, insomnia and poor concentration) . Additional secondary analyses were performed to assess the association between a current diagnosis of alcohol dependence or drug dependence (in models that did not include substance use) and ART discontinuation. Current alcohol dependence was determined with the CIDI (Robins et a!., 1988) at the baseline (recruitment) HIV-LIVE research inter\u00ad view and the CIDI, Short Form at subsequent interviews. Current drug dependence was assessed with the CIDI, Short Form at all research interviews. Other independent variables The following covariates were considered for inclu\u00ad sion in regression models based on clinical consid\u00ad erations and evidence from previous studies of ART use in patients with addictions: age; gender; race/ ethnicity; homelessness (any night spent in a shelter or on the street in past six months) (Kertesz et a!., 2005); time in jail (any in past six months); and HIV symptoms. We measured HIV-related symptoms using the 20-item HIV Symptom Index, which has been used to monitor symptoms in the AIDS Adult Clinical Trials Group (Justice et a!., 2001). We observed a strong correlation between the CES-D and the HIV Symptom Index (r =0.47); therefore, we used a modified HIV Symptom Index described in other studies (Kilbourne et a!., 2002) excluding questions that overlap with the CES-D questionnaire (e.g. questions about sadness, anxiety, sleep pro\u00ad blems, fatigue and memory loss). Laboratory para\u00admeters included CD4 cell count, HIV loglo RNA and hepatitis C antibody status. Statistical analysis We used generalised estimation equations (GEE) (Zeger et a!., 1988) and logistic regression methods to examine factors associated with ART discontinua\u00ad tion. Predictor variables were assessed at time TN approximately six months prior to the outcome at TN + I' Only observations where the subject was on ART at TN contributed to analyses. Since subjects could contribute multiple pairs of observations, we used the GEE approach to adjust for the correlation between repeated measures from the same subject over time using a working independence correlation matrix. The empirical standard errors from the GEE approach were used for all analyses. To avoid the potential for colinearity, we assessed the correlation between each pair of independent variables and none of the variables included in regression models were highly correlated (i.e. no correlation was greater than 0.40). Covariates were selected for inclusion in the multivariable models if their p-values were <0.10 in unadjusted analyses. To avoid linearity assumptions, continuous covariates were categorised based on descriptive statistics (e.g. median or tertiles) from the study sample. All predictor variables except for gender, age and race/ ethnicity were allowed to vary with time. Health insurance status was not included in the models since 99% of all subjects had access to private, Medicaid or other publicly funded health insurance. For descriptive purposes, we calculated the propor\u00ad tion of subjects who ever discontinued ART during the study using Kaplan-Meier analyses. Subjects were censored if they did not complete a follow-up interview. Analyses were conducted using two-sided tests and an alpha level of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. All analyses were carried out using SAS version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Results Among the 400 HIV-LIVE subjects, 303 (76%) were on ART at least once during the study and therefore eligible for analysis. Thirty-seven of these 303 subjects (12%) were not included in this analysis because of a missed study visit at the subsequent follow-up. No significant differences were found between the analytic sample (266/303; 88%) and those with incomplete follow-up (37/303; 12%) in terms of age, race/ethnicity, housing status, heavy alcohol consumption or cocaine or heroin use. A higher proportion of subjects with incomplete follow-up had substantial depressive symptoms .0 1042 T. W Kim et at. co Table I.

Overall, the 266 subjects contributed a total of 743 observations to the longitudinal analyses. Discontinuation of ART was reported in 18% (135/743) of the observations; 12.4% (92/743) were not on ART at T N+ 1, and 5.8% (43/743) had stopped ART for at least 30 days since TN' The median number of days without ART in the previous six months for this last group was 60 (interquartile range 44-94). We obtained information about reasons for ART discontinuation in 62% (84/135) of the cases. Subjects could specify multiple reasons for stopping ART from a checklist of responses. In about three\u00ad fourths of the cases of discontinuation (62/84; 74%), reasons other than 'MD told me to' were cited. The most common reason was 'just took self off' or 'personal and issues related to lost medications or lack of refills (8/84; 10%). As shown in Table II, factors associated with discontinuation of ART in the unadjusted analyses were: cocaine use (unadjusted OR =1.86; 95%CI: 1.18, 2.94); heroin use (OR =2.12; and depressive symptoms (OR =2.26; 95%CI: 1.49,3.43) but not heavy alcohol use. Other factors associated with discontinuation were: age less than 40; female gender; homelessness; higher viral load; and more HIV-related symptoms. Cocaine, heroin and heavy alcohol use were not significant predictors of ART discontination in a multivariable model that adjusted for age, gender, homelessness, CD4 count, HIV viral load and HIV Symptom Index (Table II). Similarly, diagnoses of alcohol dependence (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.18; 95%CI: were not asso\u00ad ciated with ART discontinuation. Subjects with substantial depressive symptoms were more likely to discontinue ART (AOR = 1.66; 95%CI: 1.04, 2.65). Similar results were found when analysing depressive symptoms with the mod\u00ad ified CES-D somatic symptoms) (AOR = 1.07,3.11). Other factors independently associated with ART disconti\u00ad nuation were age <40, higher HIV viral load and higher HIV Symptom Index score (8-15). Discussion In this sample of HIV-infected adults with past or current alcohol problems, patients with substantial depressive symptoms had almost twice the likelihood of discontinuing ART six months later.

To our knowledge, no other studies have exam\u00ad ined the relationship between heavy alcohol use and ART discontinuation despite the former's high prevalence among HIV-infected drug users (Miguez et aI., 2003) and its association with suboptimal adherence (Braithwaite et aI., 2005; Samet et al., 2004). This study also differs from previous studies examining substance use and ART utilization in a number of respects: the current study (I) used validated instruments to assess substance use and substance use disorders rather than relying on physician detection in clinical care; (2) prospectively assessed predictor variables at least six months before the outcome suggesting a temporal relation\u00ad ship between depressive symptoms and discontinua\u00ad tion; (3) examined a measure of depressive symptoms highlighting the clinical importance of co-occurring affective disorders with substance use disorders; and (4) included an indicator of HIV quality oflife (HIV Symptom Index) often missing in studies of antiretroviral medication use. Our data are consistent with prior studies examin\u00ad ing HIV-infected women (Ahdieh et aI., 2005), gay men (Li et aI., 2005) and homeless persons (Moss et aI., 2004) in which depressive symptoms were found to be associated with discontinuation of ART. Based upon our results, this observation appears to apply to HIV-infected persons with past or current alcohol problems as well. Depression is common in HIV-infected patients (Bing et aI., 200 I; Fairfield et aI., 2001). However, despite being prevalent and associated with higher mortality in this population (Cook et aI., 2004: Ickovics et al., 2001), it is under\u00ad diagnosed in clinical practice. Asch et al. (2003) found that clinical depression was recognised in only about half of patients; patients with less education were more at risk for having depression under\u00ad recognised. Psychopharmacologic and psychothera\u00ad peutic treatments are associated with better ART utilization (Cook et aI., 2006). Since mood disorders commonly occur with sub\u00ad stance use disorders (Conway et aI., 2006; Grant et aI., 2004), screening and management of depres\u00ad sion in HIV-infected adults with alcohol problems are likely to be particularly important to maximise the benefits of ART. A growing body of evidence suggests that shared neurobiological pathways are involved in addiction and depression (Brady et aI., 2005). Even previous alcohol dependence is asso\u00ad ciated with a fourfold higher risk of depression (Hasin & Grant, 2002). Co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders have worse psychiatric and addiction outcomes than either alone (Compton et aI., 2003). This paper's findings suggest that depression may be associated with worse HIV out\u00ad comes in this population by means of its association with ART discontinuation. We did not find an association between cocaine, heroin or heavy alcohol use and ART discontinua\u00ad tion in adjusted analyses. Since eligibility required being prescribed ART, this study examined a specific subgroup of substance users. It may be that physi\u00ad cians offered ART to certain patients with substance abuse based upon unmeasured factors thought to be predictive of better ART adherence. Among IDUs in Vancouver, patient's self-assessment of ability to meet challenges related to ART management (e.g. refilling prescriptions on time, continuing ARTwhen using drugs or in withdrawal etc.) was associated with sustaining ART use rather than frequency of heroin or cocaine use (Kerr et aI., 2005). These findings suggest that substance use, per se, may not be reasonable justification for withholding ART on the basis of fears of medication treatment interrup\u00ad tion. Instead an assessment of a patient's ability to sustain ART use should involve a careful evaluation for depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, unstable housing (Moss et aI., 2004) and HIV-related somatic symptoms. Similar to other studies (Ahdieh et aI., 2001; Kerr et aI., 2004; Mocroft et aI., 2005), we found that more HIV symptoms predicted subsequent discon\u00ad tinuation of ART. This study adds to the growing literature demonstrating their clinical importance. HIV-related symptoms are common; patients re\u00ad ported an average of 12 in the previous year in one study (Heath et al., 2002). HIV-related symptoms are among the strongest predictors of health-related quality of life (Hays et aI., 2000), hospitalisation and mortality (Kilbourne et al., 2002). Our study extends that literature by demonstrating their im\u00ad portance among people with alcohol problems. The finding that a higher HIV viral load is associated with a greater likelihood of subsequent discontinuation is also consistent with other studies (Ahdieh et al., 2001; Li et aI., 2005). Since higher viral loads are often found in patients with lower CD4 counts, this finding may be the consequence of patients with more advanced HIV disease having greater difficulty tolerating ART. However, since our analyses were adjusted for CD4 count and HIV symptoms, a higher viral load (which was measured at the first interview) may have indicated that the .0 Discontinuation of ART in patients with alcohol problems 1045 oco subject was already non-adherent prior to disconti\u00ad N o nuing therapy. The following limitations should be considered~ co when interpreting this study's findings. First, we did =' L.. not have information about why patients discontin\u00ad <D U. ued ART in over a third of the cases. This is L() important as the dynamics of physician-recom\u00ad\"\u00a2 .,.... mended discontinuation because of, for example, intolerable medication side effects, may be different than those of patient-initiated discontinuation with\u00ad out physician consultation. However, the informa\u00ad tion that was available to us in terms of reasons for ART discontinuation was consistent with overall findings, namely that 49% reported discontinuing for personal reasons versus 17% for substance abuse. Second, we did not have information about provider or clinic characteristics that may have influenced the likelihood of ART discontinuation. Third, we did not have clinical or immunological information on the consequences of discontinuing ART as we have defined it in this study. Some subjects may have discontinued ART for 30 days and then restarted ART without negative clinical consequences such as acquisition of viral resistance mutations. However, prior studies have found higher mortality risk with intermittent use of ART (Riley et a!., 2005). Also, because of the observational design of this study, conclusions about causal relationships cannot be inferred. However, information on predictor vari\u00ad ables was prospectively assessed before the outcome, which supports a temporal association between depressive symptoms and ART discontinuation. Another study limitation, given the importance of depressive symptoms with regards to ART disconti\u00ad nuation, is that we did not have additional informa\u00ad tion on psychiatric diagnosis or antidepressant utilization. Finally, although in this analysis heavy alcohol use did not impact ART discontinuation, our sample did not include people without current or past alcohol problems, in whom heavy alcohol use could have an impact on ART utilization. The generalis ability of this study's findings may be limited to Hl'V-infected persons with past or current alcohol problems who are prescribed ART. In this study of HIV-infected adults with past or current alcohol problems, depressive symptoms pre\u00ad dicted subsequent ART discontinuation. Their re\u00ad cognition and treatment may be important in maintaining ART and its associated clinical benefits in this patient population.

Substance Abuse Primary Care Quality and Addiction Severity: A Prospective Cohort Study Theresa W . Kim, Jeffrey H. Samet, Debbie M. Cheng, Michael R. Winter , Dana Gelb Safran, and Richard Saitz Background. Alcohol and drug use disorders are chronic diseases that require on- going management of physical, psychiatric, and social consequences. While specific addiction-focused interventions in primary care are efcacious, the influence of overall primary care quality (PCQ) on addiction outcomes has not been studied. The aim of thisstudy was to prospectively examine if higher PCQ is associated with lower addiction severity among patients with substance use disorders. Study Population. Subjects with alcohol, cocaine, and/or heroin use disorders who initiated primary care after being discharged from an urban residential detoxication program. Measurements. We used the Primary Care Assessment Survey (PCAS), a well-val- idated, patient-completed survey that measures dening attributes of primary carenamed by the Institute of Medicine. Nine summary scales cover two broad areas of PCQ: the patient-physician relationship (communication, interpersonal treatment, thoroughness of the physical exam, whole-person knowledge, preventive counseling,and trust) and structural/organizational features of care (organizational access, nancial access, and visit-based continuity). Each of the three addiction outcomes (alcohol ad- diction severity (ASI-alc), drug addiction severity (ASI-drug), and any drug or heavyalcohol use) were derived from the Addiction Severity Index and assessed 6-18 months after PCAS administration. Separate longitudinal regression models included a single PCAS scale as the main predictor variable as well as variables known to be associatedwith addiction outcomes. Main Results. Eight of the nine PCAS scales were associated with lower alcohol addiction severity at follow-up ( p/C20.05). Two measures of relationship quality (com- munication and whole- person knowledge of the patient) were associated with the largestdecreases in ASI-alc ( /C00.06). More whole-person knowledge, organizational access, and visit-based continuity predicted lower drug addiction severity (ASI-drug: /C00.02). Two PCAS scales (trust and whole-person knowledge of the patient) were associatedwith lower likelihood of subsequent substance use (adjusted odds ratio, [AOR] 50.76, 95 respectively). Conclusion. Core features of PCQ, particularly those reflecting the quality of the physician-patient relationship, were associated with positive addiction outcomes. Our ndings suggest that the provision of patient-centered, comprehensive care fromrHealth Research and Educational Trust DOI: 10.1111/j.1475-6773.2006.00630.x 755a primary care clinician may be an important treatment component for substance use disorders. Key Words. Substance abuse, primary care, quality of care, physician-patient relationship Primary care is being asked to expand its role in the identication and man- agement of addictive disorders (National Council for Community Behaviorial Healthcare 2003; New Freedom Commission on Mental Health 2003). Train- ing sessions for primary care physicians and clinical reminders have been developed to increase the use of efcacious counseling tools (Saitz et al. 2003; Saitz, Sullivan, and Samet 2000) and practical screening instruments to iden- tify addiction disorders (Maisto and Saitz 2003). Pharmacological therapies are now available in primary care for the treatment of opioid dependence (e.g.,buprenorphine) (Fiellin and O'Connor 2002) and alcohol use disorders (e.g., naltrexone and acamprosate). Various forms of integration between primary care and addictions treatment have been demonstrated to be associated with better addiction outcomes (Willenbring and Olson 1999; Weisner et al. 2001; Friedmann et al. 2003). While there is substantial literature promoting greater access to primary care for individuals with addictions, little is known about whether the quality of primary care should be considered. In other chronic disorders such as diabetes mellitus (Campbell, Roland, and Wilkin 2001), depression (O'Mal-ley, Forrest and Miranda 2003), and tobacco use (Safran et al. 1998), primary care quality (PCQ) is an important determinant of outcomes. The quality of primary care delivered to individuals with substance use disorders may be important for addiction outcomes as well. How might higher quality primary care lead to better addiction out- comes? The Institute of Medicine (IOM) and others (Institute of Medicine Address correspondence to Theresa W.

Alcohol and drug problems, often unrecognizedin medical encounters (Saitz et al. 1997; Weisner and Matzger 2003), may be missed less frequently in comprehensive and supportive primary care rela- tionships. Adherence to treatment recommendations for addictive disorders may be higher in the presence of such relationships between patients and their primary care physicians. As alcohol and drug dependence are often chronic illnesses with relapsing and remitting courses (McLellan et al. 2000), effective chronic disease management strategies to enhance treatment adherence and monitor disease progression may ameliorate addiction severity. Additionally, coordination of addiction, medical, psychiatric, and social services care by primary care physicians may be especially valuable for patients with comor- bid physical and/or psychiatric illnesses ( Johnson et al. 1995; Mertens et al.2003; De, Samet, and Saitz 2004). We used data from the Health Evaluation and Linkage to Primary care (HELP) study, a randomized trial of an intervention to link adults entering an urban detoxication unit to primary care. Previous analyses showed that ran- domization to the intervention group was associated with greater likelihood of initiating primary care but was not associated with better addiction outcomes (Samet et al. 2003). An additional analysis demonstrated that attending at least two primary care visits, regardless of randomization arm, was associated with lower addiction severity and risk of subsequent substance use (Saitz et al.2005). The current analysis takes this line of examination a step further and asks, among individuals with addictions who attend primary care, is the qual- ity of primary care associated with addiction outcomes, and if so, which at- tributes of PCQ are important? METHODS Study Design This is a prospective cohort study of patients with substance use disorders who initiated primary care during the HELP study (Samet et al. 2003). People eligible for the HELP study were adult inpatients of a residential detoxication unit who spoke Spanish or English, reported alcohol, heroin, or cocaine astheir rst or second drug of choice, and either resided in proximity to the primary care clinic to which they would be referred, or were homeless. Patients were excluded from the parent study if they intended to continuePrimary Care Quality and Addiction Severity 757existing primary care relationships, suffered significant dementia, had specific plans to leave the Boston area that would prevent research participation, could not provide contact information for tracking purposes, or were pregnant. Allparticipants were randomly assigned to receive either standard medical care referral by clinical addictions staff on an as needed basis (usual care) or en- hanced referral (the trial intervention) to primary care in the Boston area and surrounding communities. Enhanced referral included a multidisciplinary as- sessment (conducted in the detoxication unit at study entry), referral to a particular physician based upon patient preference, letter of introduction to the primary care physician, and follow-up phone calls to promote adherence to the initial primary care appointment (which occurred after discharge from the detoxication unit). After the baseline research assessment at the detoxication unit, bian- nual research interviews were conducted over the 24-month study period.Except for demographics, all assessments, including measures of addiction severity and health care utilization, were repeated at each interview. Alcohol breath tests were performed at follow-up interviews to encourage honest re- porting (Welte et al. 1998). The current study included HELP participants who initiated primary care, regardless of randomization group, and then completed at least one fol- low-up interview after initiating primary care. In total, participants in the current study completed at least three separate research interviews: (1) an assessment at the detoxication unit where study recruitment took place (i.e.,the ''baseline'' interview); (2) a subsequent interview in which the participant reported on the quality of their primary care relationship (the ''PCQ assess- ment'' interview); and (3) a follow-up interview in which addiction outcomes were assessed (the ''follow-up addiction'' interview).

Main Independent Variable The Primary Care Assessment Survey (PCAS; Safran et al. 1998) is a well- validated, patient-completed survey that measures dening attributes of pri-mary care named by the IOM and others (Institute of Medicine 1996; Stareld et al. 1998; a well-validated meas- ure of PCQ that has been used to monitor the performance of primary care758 HSR: Health Services Research 42:2 (April 2007 )delivered by large health plans and delivery systems over time (Murphy et al. 2001; Safran et al. 2002). Higher PCQ, as measured by the PCAS, has been linked to important patient outcomes such as adherence to physician's advice and improved health status (Safran et al. 1998). The PCAS measures PCQ in the context of a specific physician-patient primary care relationship and references the entirety of that relationship (Saf- ran et al. 1998). Nine summary scales (Table 1) cover two broad areas of PCQ: the patient-physician relationship (communication, interpersonal treatment,thoroughness of the physical exam, whole-person knowledge, preventive counseling, and trust) and structural/organizational features of care (organi- zational access, nancial access, and visit-based continuity). Each scale has a range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating more of the underlying attribute.Table 1: Summary of Item Content for Primary Care Assessment Survey Scales Dening Characteristic Description Physician-patient interaction Communication Thoroughness of primary physician's questions about symptoms, attention to what patient says, clarity of explanations and instructions, and advice and help in making decisions about care Interpersonal treatmentPrimary physician's patience, friendliness, caring, respect, and time spent with patient Thoroughness of physical examPrimary physician's physical medical history; responsibilities at work, home, school; health concerns, values, and beliefs Preventive counseling Whether physician has discussed the following with patient: smoking, alcohol use, seatbelt use, diet, exercise, stress, safe sex Trust Assessment of physician's integrity, competence, and role as patient's agent Structural feature of care Organizational access Ability to get through to physician's ofce by telephone, to get a medical appointment when sick, to obtain information by telephone, punctuality of appointments, convenience of ofce location, and convenience of ofce hours Financial access Assessment of amount of money patient pays for physician visits, medication, and other prescribed treatments Visit-based continuity How often patient sees primary care physician (not an assistant or partner) for routine check-ups and for appointmentswhen sickPrimary Care Quality and Addiction Severity 759Dependent Variable Each of the three outcomes were derived from the Addiction Severity Index (McLellan et al. 1992): (1) alcohol addiction severity using the alcohol com- posite score (ASI-alc), (2) drug addiction severity using the drug composite score (ASI-drug), and (3) any drug or heavy alcohol use (more than three drinks in a day) in the past 30 days. The latter variable will be referred to as ''any substance use.'' ASI-alc and ASI-drug composite scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating greater severity. Statistical Analysis We examined the relationship between higher PCQ and addiction outcomes by tting separate multivariable longitudinal regression models for each out- come. Each regression model included a single PCAS scale as the main pre- dictor variable. The unit of analysis was each study interview (i.e., observation). All study participants ( n5183) contributed to the analyses of any substance use ( n5355 observations). Only participants with alcohol as a rst or second substance of choice ( n5117) contributed to the alcohol severity analyses ( n5228 observations). Likewise, only subjects with heroin or cocaine as a rst or second drug of choice ( n5145) contributed to the drug severity analyses ( n5284 observations). The longitudinal regression models accounted for the correlation from using repeated observations on the same subject. Continuous outcomes (ASI- alc and ASI-drug) were analyzed using a general linear model for correlated data with an unstructured correlation matrix (Liang and Zeger 1986). For the dichotomous outcome of any substance use, generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression models with empirical standard errors were used toanalyze the data (Zeger, Liang, and Albert 1988). Each regression model also included the following covariates: age, gender, race/ethnicity, education less than 12 years (yes versus no), homelessness (any night in a shelter or street in the past 6 months); (Kertesz et al. 2005), health insurance, addiction severity (baseline alcohol and drug ASI scores at HELP study entry), HELP random- ization group, time of addiction outcome assessment after HELP study entry (12, 18, or 24 months), and interval between assessments of PCQ and addic- tion outcomes (6, 12, or 18 months). No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons due to the exploratory nature of the analyses. In order to assess whether PCQ was a predictor of subsequent addiction severity and substance use, models included addiction outcomes measured at the study interview afterthe PCQ assessment interview. As research interviews760 HSR: Health Services Research 42:2 (April 2007 )were scheduled approximately every 6 months over the 24-month study pe- riod, the interval between PCAS administration and the addiction assessment was 6 months if consecutive follow-up interviews were completed. However, ifa participant missed a scheduled follow-up interview, then the substance abuse assessment at the next available interview was used (12 or 18 months after the assessment of PCQ ). The interval between the PCQ assessment and addiction outcomes was 6 months for 269 (75.8 percent) of the 355 available observa- tions; 12 months for 60 (16.9 percent); and 18 months for 26 (7.3 percent). A term for the interaction between each PCAS scale and the duration of time between PCQ assessment and addiction outcome assessment was included in initial models to assess whether the effect of PCQ depended upon the length of time between PCQ and addiction assessments. The interactions were not significant ( p4.1) and therefore not included in the nal models. Longitudinal regression results for addiction severity are presented as the mean difference in alcohol or drug severity associated with a standard deviation increase in PCAS score. Similarly, regression results for substance use are presented as the risk of substance use associated with a standard deviation increase in PCAS score. Reported p-values were two-tailed and considered statistically significant if o.05. All analyses were completed using SAS/STAT software, version 8.2 (SAS/STAT 1999). RESULTS Study Subjects This study's analytic sample was derived from the HELP cohort. Of the 470 subjects in the HELP cohort, two died before follow-up and 400/468 (85percent) completed at least one interview during the two-year follow-up pe- riod. Of the 400 subjects with follow-up, 253 (63 percent) reported initiating primary medical care after being discharged from the detoxication unit. As previously reported, women were more likely to link with primary care as well as those with recent episodic medical visits, family support for abstinence, and health insurance (Saitz et al. 2004). Recent incarceration decreased the like- lihood of linkage. Ethnicity, recent addiction or mental health treatment uti- lization, addiction severity, health status, substance problem recognition, and perceived need for medical care did not affect linkage. Among the 253 subjects who initiated primary care, 183 (72 percent) returned for a third interview (the ''addiction interview'') comprising our study sample. No significant differences were found between the 70 participantsPrimary Care Quality and Addiction Severity 761(70/253, 28 percent) who initiated primary care but were unavailable for the addiction interview and the study cohort in terms of age, gender, race/eth- nicity, housing status, education level, alcohol abuse severity, or drug abuseseverity.

A substantial minority (30 percent) did not graduate from high school and about half were homeless. At baseline, the mean ASI-alc and mean ASI-drugscores were 0.45 and 0.26, respectively. These scores are similar to those of individuals entering the public treatment system in Massachusetts (Smith and Larson 2003) but more severe than those in a clinical addiction treatment sample in an HMO in California (Weisner, McLellan, and Hunkeler 2000). The mean Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS; Ware 1994) scores were 46 and 32 respectively (the mean MCS and PCS score for the U.S. population is 50; 89 percent of adults with MCS scores of 30-34 screens positive for de- pression). The lowest ranked measure of PCQ was whole-person knowledge and the highest was visit-based continuity. Multivariable Regression Results The 183 subjects contributed 355 observations to the longitudinal regression models. Table 3 presents the results of regression analyses examining the nine PCAS scales as independent predictors of alcohol and drug addiction severity. We were able to detect significant associations between PCQ and addiction outcomes most consistently in the alcohol addiction severity analyses.

Statistically significant associations ( po.05) in bold.Primary Care Quality and Addiction Severity 763scores on 8 of the 9 PCAS scales representing higher PCQ were associated with lower alcohol addiction severity at follow-up. Two measures of relation- ship quality (communication and whole person knowledge of the patient) wereassociated with the largest decrease in alcohol severity (ASI-alc /C00.06); visit- based continuity was associated with the smallest decrease ( /C00.03). The results of drug severity (Table 3) and any substance use analyses (Table 4) were mixed. Higher scores on three PCAS scale scores (whole- person knowledge, organizational access, and visit-based continuity) were associated with lower drug addiction severity: adjusted mean decrease in ASI-drug 5/C00.01 to /C00.02 for each of the three PCAS scales. The other six PCAS scale scores were not significantly associated with drug addiction severity. More whole-person knowledge and trust were significantly associated with lower odds of substance use (Table 4) (adjusted odds ratio, [AOR] 50.65, 95 50.76, 95 percent CI 50.59, 0.97, respectively). Other PCAS scales did not significantly predict substance use. To address the possibility of higher order effects of the HELP interven- tion, we tested for an interaction between HELP randomization group and Table 4: Adjusted Odds Ratio of Any Substance Use at Follow-up Associ-ated with Higher Primary Care Quality Primary Care Quality AttributeAdjusted Odds Ratio (95% Condence Interval) of Any Substance Usen Physician-patient interaction Communication 0.95 (0.73, 1.25) Interpersonal treatment 0.80 (0.63, 1.02) Thoroughness of physical exam 0.99 (0.76, 1.30)Whole person knowledge 0.65 (0.51, 0.83) Preventive counseling 0.91 (0.74, 1.13) Trust 0.76 (0.59, 0.97) Structural features of care Organizational access 0.86 (0.68, 1.09)Financial access 0.83 (0.66, 1.17) nSubstance use is dened as any drug use (cocaine or heroin) or any alcohol intoxication ( 43 drinks on any occasion) in past the 30 days.

The interaction was only significant in the model examining organizational access and alcohol severity. We explored whether primary care utilization affected the relationship between PCQ and addictions. In the main analyses, we did not adjust for primary care utilization because of the relatively low variability in the number of primary care visits. For 75 percent of the observations used in the analyses, patients reported between one and three primary care visits in the previous 6 months. Variability of the length of primary care relationships was also rel- atively narrow due to the fact that all study subjects initiated primary care during the study period. However, as primary care utilization is an important consideration, we included a covariate for the number of primary care visits (self-report) to the main models. Including this covariate did not alter our ndings. We also performed secondary analyses with covariates for exposure to substance abuse treatment (yes/no), AA participation (yes/no), and any men- tal health visit (yes/no), which again did not change the direction of the es- timates or diminish the statistical significance of the results. However, in three of the models, the p-values increased: in the model examining visit-based continuity and alcohol addiction severity ( p-value increased from .05 to .06), and in the models examining visit-based continuity and organizational access predicting drug addiction severity ( p-values increased to .07). As the param- eter estimates remained unchanged, higher p-values may have resulted from the addition of three more covariates to the models and diminished statisticalpower. Overall, the relationship between the quality of primary care and addiction outcomes did not appear to be mediated by these utilization var- iables. DISCUSSION In this cohort of adults recruited from a residential detoxication unit and prospectively assessed over a 24-month study period, higher quality primary care across multiple domains was associated with lower addiction severity and odds of substance use. These associations did not appear to be mediated by variables previously identied in the literature to be related to health care quality (i.e., health insurance, gender, race/ethnicity), primary care utilization, or baseline addiction severity. Two key PCQ attributes reflecting the quality ofprimary care relationships\u2014 \u2014physicians' patient trust\u2014 \u2014were significant predictors of lower alcohol severity and lower risk of substance use.Primary Care Quality and Addiction Severity 765Our ndings align with those from previous studies that have demon- strated the importance of the physician-patient relationship in patient ac- ceptance and receipt of preventive services (O'Malley et al. 2004), cancerscreening measures (Safran et al. 1998; O'Malley and Forrest 2002), and de- pression treatment (O'Malley, Forrest, and Miranda 2003). Among HIV-in- fected individuals, trust and whole-person care has been linked with higher adherence to HIV medications (Schneider et al. 2004) as well as better phys- ical and mental health functioning (Preau et al. 2004). Although the impor- tance of interpersonal aspects of primary care has been reported in various populations, to our knowledge, this is the rst study to examine their impor- tance for patients with alcohol and drug use disorders. In this study, whole-person knowledge emerged as the most consistent predictor of better addiction outcomes. Individualizing clinical decisions based upon the ''contextual knowledge'' of a patient's beliefs and values aswell as responsibilities at work, home, or school (Weiner 2004) may have particular importance for individuals with addiction problems. It is notable that whole-person knowledge was one of the lowest ranked quality measure in this study, consistent with studies in other populations (Murphy et al. 2001). This suggests that careful attention to this aspect of primary care could be important when designing or evaluating programs that integrate addiction treatment with primary care. It is important to note that the PCAS is not a measure of patient sat- isfaction but rather a well-validated measure of PCQ. The PCAS measuresprimary care in terms of a standard derived from the IOM's definition of primary care and may or may not relate to individual patient satisfaction. Other studies have measured PCQ in terms of delivery of specific services such as influenza vaccination or cervical screening. In light of our postulated mechanisms of higher quality primary care improving addictions, using the PCAS may have more relevance than using process of care measures. Using this validated instrument to measure primary care, single standard deviation increases in PCQ scores were associated with a lower risk of sub- sequent substance use (i.e., 24-35 percent decrease in odds of any use) and moderate decreases in alcohol addiction severity (0.03-0.06 on scales ranging from 0 to 1). The reduction in ASI-alc scores demonstrated in this study aresimilar to the effect of two primary care visits versus none (ASI-alc 5/C00.04) found in a previous study (Saitz et al. 2005) but less than the effect of more intensive interventions such as case-managed residential care (Conrad et al. 1998) or work therapy for homeless veterans (ASI-alc 5/C00.16) (Kashner et al. 2002).766 HSR: Health Services Research 42:2 (April 2007 )The clinical significance of the addiction differences in this study should be viewed in light of the fact that: (1) The magnitude of PCQ may be un- derestimated in this cohort with relatively new primary care relationships.Greater cumulative effects of higher quality primary care might be observed over a longer period of time. (2) The ability to robustly predict addiction outcomes with one exposure is rare. Since changes in addiction outcomes generally result from cumulative changes in the environment, it is not sur- prising that our ndings were modest compared to more intensive interven- tions. We did not expect to nd large differences in addiction severity among these patients, all of whom had initiated substance abuse treatment and were receiving primary care. As there is renewed interest in providing primary care to individuals with addictions, ensuring that core features of primary care exist in their primary care relationships might augment the postulated addiction benets by the estimates found in this study. While all of the effects of PCQ were in the hypothesized direction, we were unable to detect associations between attributes of PCQ and drug ad- diction severity. Despite adjusted analyses, the impact of the quality of pri- mary care relationships initiated over a relatively short period of time may have been difcult to isolate in this cohort with significant homelessness and poverty. As drug dependence is more difcult to treat than alcohol dependence without adequate pharmacotherapy, the effect of primary care on addiction outcomes may have been overwhelmed without rst re- ducing system-level barriers to opioid agonist therapy. Additionally, theprevalence of comorbid psychiatric conditions is generally higher in samples with drug addiction than those with alcohol addiction (Grant et al. 2004). Thus, detecting the effect of differences in PCQ may have been more difcult without addressing psychiatric comorbidities in patients with drug use disorders. Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the study ndings. The major limitation is the potential confounding resulting from this study's observational design. We cannot exclude the possibility that addiction severity was a determinant of the quality of primary care rather than PCQ predicting addiction outcomes. We attempted to minimize this possibility by: (1) using a lagged analysis, i.e., assessing the addiction severity of an individualat least 6 months after the receipt of primary care services; (2) including well- established determinants of PCQ, specifically, race/ethnicity, gender, and health insurance in the analyses; and (3) adjusting for baseline addiction se- verity. Still, unmeasured factors may have influenced which participants re- ceived better primary care and mediated addiction outcomes. A propensityPrimary Care Quality and Addiction Severity 767analysis might have better addressed this limitation, however, this study's sample size could not support this approach. Another limitation relates to the fact these data were primarily collected for a randomized trial of an intervention to link adults to primary care. It is unlikely, however, that the HELP intervention confounded our results since previous analyses demonstrated that the HELP intervention was not associ- ated with addiction benet. In addition, we included HELP randomization group in the models and did not nd significant interactions between PCAS scores and HELP randomization group (except for the alcohol model with organizational access). However, we acknowledge that the impact of primary care on addiction outcomes may have been evident in individuals who were ''primed'' by the HELP intervention to be responsive to the effects of primary care. Finally, generalizability of the study's ndings is another limitation. It is important to note that these data reflect a single urban adult population with substantial social and economic problems as well as alcohol and drug use disorders severe enough to require detoxication admission. The sample is not representative of patients with substance use disorders found in primary care, who may have less severe and persistent addiction trajectories. Hence, it is unclear whether our ndings would be applicable to patients with less severe substance use disorders and these ndings should be examined in other co- horts. Regardless of whether these ndings are applicable to other patients in primary care, the population that we studied is an important one as this cohortis representative of many clinical samples in public-funded treatment settings (Smith and Larson 2003). This study's ndings are relevant to recent efforts to expand primary care's involvement in the management of addictive disorders. Financial and structural integration between substance abuse services and primary medical care have been proposed to increase coordination of traditionally separate systems of care (National Council for Community Behaviorial Healthcare 2003; New Freedom Commission on Mental Health 2003). As policy-makers move forward with increasing primary care's role in managing substance use disorders, our study suggests that certain core components of primary care, particularly the ability to provide whole-person care, are important to real-izing the postulated benets of increasing access to primary care. In summary, multiple features of PCQ were associated with lower ad- diction severity and risk of future substance use. Our ndings suggest that enhancing primary care's ability to deliver patient-centered, comprehensive, longitudinal care may have a benecial impact on addiction outcomes.768 HSR: Health Services Research 42:2 (April 2007 )ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by a grant from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (RO1-AA10870) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (RO1-DA10019) (R25-DA13582).

MD, MPHf,gBedford Boston, MA; Durham, NC; Milwaukee, WI; and Houston, TX Background Racial disparities exist in invasive cardiac procedure use and, sometimes, in subsequent functional status outcomes. We explored whether racial differences in functional outcomes occur in settings where differences in access and treatment are minimized. Methods We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of 1022 white and African-American cardiac patients with positive nuclear imaging studies in 5 VA hospitals. Patients' functional status was assessed at baseline, 6, and 12 months later using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire and the SF-12, controlling for treatment received, clinical, sociodemographic, and psychological characteristics. Results There were no significant baseline effects of race on functional status, after adjusting for sociodemographics, comorbid conditions, maximal medical therapy, severity of ischemia on nuclear imaging study, personal attitudes, and beliefs. Although there were no race differences in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty use, there was a trend of African Americans being less likely to undergo coronary artery bypass graft, after 6 months (1.4% vs 6.5%) and 1 year(1.9 vs 6.9%). After adjustment, the decline in the SF12 Physical Component Summary from baseline to 6 months was, on average, 2.4 points less for African Americans than for whites, and at 12 months, Anginal Stability improved 8.4 points more for African Americans. The relative strength and direction of both findings persisted after removing covariates thatmight be confounded with race, and African Americans decreased less than whites on Physical Limitations, and improved more on Treatment Satisfaction, Anginal Frequency, and Disease Perceptions. Conclusions In a setting where differences in access are minimized, so are racial differences in functional status outcomes. (Am Heart J 2007;153:418 225.) Despite the documentation of racial disparities in the use of invasive cardiac procedures in numerous set-tings, 1,2African-American cardiac patients have better survival than white patients cared for in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA),3-5where racial differences in access to care are minimized and where substantialefforts have been made to improve the quality andequity of treatment. 6,7 Investigators have also examined disparities in func- tional status outcomes among cardiac patients, arguingthat such information supplies necessary data beyondinformation on mortality, about the effects of varioustherapies on patients' functioning and well-being. 8,9 Functional status ratings vary by race in the general population, even after adjustment for demographic factors,10such that African Americans' functional status is generally worse than that of whites, but we know of only1 study examining racial differences in functional statusoutcomes among potential candidates for revasculariza-tion. 11In that study of angiography patients, beforeFrom theaCenter for Health Quality, Outcomes and Economic Research (a VA Health Services Research and Development National Center of Excellence), Bedford VA Medical Center, Bedford, MA,bSection of General Internal Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA,cDuke Clinical Research Institute, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC,dPrimary Care Division, Clement J Zablocki VA Medical Center, Milwaukee, WI,eDepartment of Medicine, Division of General Internal Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI,fDivision of Health Policy and Quality, Houston Center for Quality of Care and Utilization Studies (a VA Health Services Research and Development National Center of Excellence), Houston VA Medical Center, Houston, TX, andgSection of Health Services Research, Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.The views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarilyrepresent the views of the Department of Veterans Affairs.The research reported here was supported by the Department of Veterans Affairs,Veterans Health Administration, Health Services Research and Development Service (ECV 97-022.2, N Kressin, PI), and the American Heart Association and the Pharmaceutical Roundtable (9970113N, N Kressin, PI).Submitted March 22, 2006; accepted November 30, 2006.Reprint requests: Nancy R.

Based on theprior findings of better survival odds for African Ameri-cans, it seems likely that racial differences in functionalstatus outcomes might also be equal or better for African-American patients in the VA setting, but the priorliterature provides conflicting information. 4,5,11-14 The purpose of our study was to examine whether there were differential functional status outcomes over6 months and 1 year, among white and AfricanAmerican VA cardiac patients, after accounting for thecare they received, patients' psychological character- istics and experiences, and clinical and sociodemo- graphic factors, among a sample drawn from differentgeographic areas. Method Sample Study setting and sample. .The study methodology has been described in detail elsewhere.15Briefly, the research was conducted at 5 large, urban, academically affiliated tertiary care VA Medical Centers with on-site cardiac catheterization (Houston, St Louis, Durham, Atlanta, Pittsburgh). We estab- lished a prospective cohort of white and African American patients likely to have coronary artery disease by screening the results of all cardiac nuclear imaging studies performed between August 1999 and January 2001, selecting those with any evidence of reversible cardiac ischemia (evidenced byreversible defects or redistribution). A total of 1025 patients were included in the final baseline cohort (74% response rate), but for the present analyses we deleted 3 patients who received coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) after inclusion in the study but before they completed their baseline interview, as the recent receipt of CABG would likely affect functional status scores (N = 1022). At 6 months, 771 (75%) responded, and at 12 months, 760 (74%) responded. This study was approved by the Human Studies Subcom- mittee of the VA medical centers involved in the study. Data collection Procedure. The functional status questions were included in baseline questionnaires administered shortly after the nuclear imaging study, and 6 and 12 months later. Questionnaire measures Independent Variables. Demographics. We assessed the patient's age, self-reported race, education, income, and marital status. Patient Psychological Characteristics and Experiences. At baseline, we assessed several dimensions related to functional status: patients' personality characteristics and experiences of racial discrimination. Negative Affectivity (NA; measured with the EPI-Q16,17) is a general disposition to experience subjective distress, which our prior work has demonstrated affects patient functional status ratings.18Optimism, a generalized predispo- sition to view things positively, is associated with healthoutcomes including rehospitalization after bypass surgery, so we reasoned that optimism might also be associated with patients' functional status ratings. We assessed this dimension with the Life Orientation Test.19Finally, as stressful experiences such as racial discrimination might negatively impact one's general well-being, including functional status, we used Krieger's well-known assessment of experiences of discrimination, to which we added an item specific to VA health care.20 Clinical and Treatment Variables. Trained nurses abstract- ed the medical records of each respondent, identifying demographics, cardiac symptoms, past medical history (in-cluding prior myocardial infarction, diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, renal, or lung disease), laboratory values, test findings, and procedure utilization, and maximal medical therapy, following the definition used by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for coronary angiography and the management of patients with chronic stable angina. 21,22 We also tracked receipt of angiography and revasculariza- tion. We included all patients in the analysis, but accounted only for angiograms taking place within 120 days of the nuclear imaging study. In the postbaseline analyses, we excluded patients who had received CABG up to 2 months before each follow-up outcomes assessment (thus excluding patients still experiencing decrements in functional status due to the surgery).23 Nuclear Study Summary Scores. Two physicians classified the severity of each nuclear imaging study after review of the official report (blinded to patient race). We categorized the risk of severe coronary obstruction, using a modification of prior methods.24Patients with reversible lesions in the distribution of left anterior descending coronary artery or in both the right coronary artery and left circumflex artery were considered bhigh risk, Qas were patients with increased lung uptake or transient ischemic dilatation with exercise or pharmacologic stress. Patients with reversible lesions in just one of the right coronary artery or left circumflex artery were considered bmoderate risk. QPatients with very small or minimally revers- ible defects were considered blow risk. QMortality data were drawn from the VA Beneficiary Identification and Record Locator System. Dependent Variables Functional Status. We assessed functional status using 2 well- validated instruments, yielding 7 unique scales. First, we included the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ), which assesses patients' perceptions of several dimensions of coro- nary artery disease including anginal stability, anginal frequen- cy, treatment satisfaction, disease perceptions, and physical limitations.25Second, we included a broad generic measure of health-related quality of life, the SF-12. This provides a mentalcomponent summary scale covering the dimensions of vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health, and a physical component summary scale covering the dimensions of physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health perceptions. The SF-12 captures about 90% of the variance in the physical and mental component summary scales of the well-validated, but longer, SF-36. 26For each functional status scale, higher scores indicate better functional status\u2014for example, less frequent angina, better physical functioning.American Heart Journal Volume 153, Number 3Kressin et al 419Data analysis Multiple analyses were performed on each of the 7 functional status scores, including all patients alive at each time point (baseline n = 1022, 6-month n = 989, 12-month n = 966). First,we examined racial differences in sociodemographics, clinicalvariables, and personal characteristics, and differences in functional status outcomes at each time point. Next, we examined racial differences in baseline scores adjusted forcomorbidity, severity of the nuclear imaging study, medicaltherapy, demographics, and patients' NA, optimism, and experiences with racial discrimination (see full list of covariates inTable I ). Then, we examined racial differences on 6-month (then 12-month) change in the scores adjusted for thesecovariates, and for baseline functional status. In a second set ofanalyses, we computed the results for models excluding variables that might be correlated with race: NA, experiences ofdiscrimination, optimism, and severity of the nuclear imagingstudy. We also considered models where any interim revascu-larization procedures were included in the set of predictorvariables. We performed a Bonferroni procedure to adjust forthe multiple tests; instead of using a .05 significance level forindividual tests on Tables I and II , we used .0024. We adopted a Bayesian framework to fit all models; the advantages of this paradigm over a classical regression approach include the ability to model explicitly missing covariate information and to model dropout probabilities for longitudinal analyses without eliminating entire cases. We fit our models via Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation 27from the posteriorTable I.

The effects of race were reported as the 95%central posterior intervals (roughly analogous to confidenceintervals) for the coefficient of the race indicator variable. Forthe longitudinal analyses, we assumed that the probability of loss to follow-up is important to consider (ie, missing data may be bmissing not at random Q 29), and that the probability of loss to follow-up may depend on the (unobserved) outcome value (eg,respondents with worse functional status may have been lesslikely to respond). 30The model consists of 2 components, fit simultaneously; the first is a linear regression with the (possibly unobserved) outcome at follow-up as a function of the baseline value, race, site-specific random intercepts, and other cova-riates. The second is a logistic regression for the binary indicatorof whether the outcome at follow-up was observed, modeled asa function of the (possibly unobserved) outcome at follow-up,adjusted for baseline score, race, and other covariates. We were interested in inferring the effect of race in the first model component. The assumption of a (normal) linear regression asthe first model component essentially guarantees identifiabilityof the model parameters. 31Note that 95% central posterior intervals do not need to be adjusted for multiplicity (eg,Bonferroni-type adjustments), as model summaries are consid- ered simultaneous inferences for a single model. To examine the sensitivity of the Bayesian selection models, we also fit least-squares regression (LSR) models of the first model component using the statistics package SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), for patients only with complete cases.Results African Americans were less likely than whites to undergo cardiac catheterization within 120 days of the nuclear imaging study (28.4% vs 38.5%, Pb.005). There were no racial differences in receipt of percuta-neous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) bet- ween (3.6% vs 5.5%, not significant [NS]) or baseline and 12 months (3.8% vs5.8%, NS), nor among the subset of patients who had received cardiac catheterization. However, there was a trend of whites receiving CABG more frequently duringeach period (1.4% vs 6.5%; 1.9% vs 6.9%; after the Bonferroni adjustment both were NS), with higher rates and more marked differences among the subset whohad received cardiac catheterization ( Table I ). There were no significant racial differences in mortality over either period. In unadjusted analyses, at baseline, African Americans had worse Mental Component Scores on the SF-12(Table II ). There were no race differences in any functional status scores at the other time points. The baseline Bayesian regression analysis indicated that there were no significant effects of race, after adjustingfor the covariates (results not shown), consistent withthe complete-case LSR analysis. Although race was notsignificant, among the covariates, we observed that NAwas negatively associated with all outcome measures(greater NA was associated with worse functional status).Among the clinical variables, angina was associated withworse outcomes in all dimensions except the MentalComponent Summary scale, and receiving maximalmedical therapy was associated with worse outcomes onAnginal Frequency, Anginal Stability, Disease Percep-tions, and Physical Limitations, consistent with thenotion that the sickest patients were receiving the mostintensive therapy. Similarly, having a bhigh risk Qnuclear scan was associated with worse Anginal Stability and Disease Perceptions. We fit 2 sets of models for each functional status outcome, one including revasculariza- tion received in the period between functional statusmeasurements, and another model without. The effect of race was significant for the same functional status variables whether or not revascularization was included,so we present the results from the more comprehensive models here, including results with and without the 4 potentially race-related covariates. As shown in Table III , which depicts changes in functional status over time, racial effects on change frombaseline to 6 months were significant only for predicting6-month change in the Physical Component Summaryscore of the SF-12 (see also Figure 1 ). After adjustment, the decline in Physical Component Summary from baseline to 6 months was, on average, 2.4 points less forAfrican Americans than for whites (similar results wereobserved after excluding the race-related covariates: thedecline was 2.31 points less for African Americans).Table II.

Clinical andsociodemographic covariates consistently associatedwith greater decline in functional status across themodels included angina (on all but Mental ComponentSummary), having received prior revascularization (onall but Treatment Satisfaction and Physical ComponentSummary), and having more education (on all butDisease Perception, Physical Component Summary, andMental Component Summary; results not shown). Racial effects for the full models predicting 12-month changes in functional status outcomes were only significant for the Anginal Stability model, where improvement from baseline to 12 months was, onaverage, 8.4 points higher for African Americans than forwhites after adjusting for the same covariates as atbaseline, as well as for revascularization (PTCA) receivedbetween baseline and 12 months, CABG received nolater than 60 days before the 12-month survey, receipt ofcatheterization within 120 days after the nuclear imagingstudy, and baseline Anginal Stability score. Again, noneof the complete-case LSR models found an associationbetween race and functional status outcomes. After examining significant covariates, higher levels of NA were associated with worse functional status (exceptwith the Anginal Frequency, Disease Perception, andTreatment Satisfaction scales). Prior revascularizationwas associated with worse functioning on the AnginalFrequency, Anginal Stability, and Disease Perception scales, but no other clinical variables were consistentlyassociated with functional status outcomes (results notshown). Results from models excluding the race-relatedcovariates indicated that African Americans improved more on Anginal Stability, Treatment Satisfaction, Angi- nal Frequency, and Disease Perceptions at 12 months,while declining more on Physical Limitations, althoughthe posterior intervals nearly include 0, suggesting thatthese findings are not strongly significant. Discussion We examined racial differences in patients' functional status outcomes over 6 and 12 months, in a system of care where sociodemographic differences and difficul-ties in access to care are minimized, using data on acohort of VA patients potentially eligible for revascular-ization, accounting for the cardiac care they received.We observed differences in the use of cardiac catheter-ization, and in CABG (but not PTCA), although all rateswere relatively low. Contrary to prior research, 11African Americans did not have worse functional status atbaseline. Furthermore, over time, there were few racialdifferences in functional status, and the few observed differences indicated more favorable outcomes among African Americans than among whites. Thus, our resultssuggest that in a system where difficulties in access tocare are minimized, and with an emphasis on minimizingdifferences in revascularization care, functional statusoutcomes are similar, whether or not we took treatmentinto account, contrary to earlier findings of differencesin functional status before adjusting for treatment. 11Table III. Bayesian analysis of racial differences in change in functional status outcomes at 6 and 12 m (whites relative to African Americans) Mean 95% Posterior intervalsModels excluding NA, experiences of discrimination, optimism, and magnitude of ischemia Mean decline in PCS from baseline to 6 m was, on average, 2.4 points less for African Americans than for whites after adjusting for the sa me covariates as in the baseline analysis, baseline PCS score, revascularization (PTCA) received between baseline and 6 m, CABG received within the first 4 m after the basel ine survey, and receipt of catheterization within 120 d after the nuclear imaging study.American Heart Journal March 2007422 Kressin et alFigure 1 Racial differences in functional status indices over time, adjusted for all covariates.American Heart Journal Volume 153, Number 3Kressin et al 423These results of similar or better outcomes for African- American patients are consistent with patterns observed in prior VA studies of mortality outcomes among patients with myocardial infarction, which showed thatdespite disparate receipt of invasive cardiac proceduresincluding cardiac catheterization and revascularization,African Americans' mortality was better than whites'. 4,5 Our findings are also similar to those showing thatAfrican-American patients had worse unadjusted qualityof life, as measured by the SF-36, but once results wereadjusted for sociodemographic factors, comorbidity andfunctional status, no differences remained. 33 However, our findings differ from other reports of racial differences in quality of life or functional status. Population-based studies have shown that African Americans consistently report worse health or func-tional status than whites even when results are adjustedby demographic factors and socioeconomic status. 10 In contrast to the general population, the relativesociodemographic homogeneity in VA acrossracial groups 34might have influenced our results toward more similar outcomes. How might our findings be explained? Our patients were farther upstream in the diagnostic process and werelikely less sick than those of Kaul et al, 11which would explain the better functional status, absence of racial differences in functional status, and the lower rates ofrevascularization we observed. Alternatively, the lowerrate of revascularization could be explained by generalunderuse of cardiac procedures in the VA health caresystem, 35which could have created a bfloor effect, Q making it difficult to detect racial differences in proce-dure use or in functional status. Furthermore, weobserved relatively slight differences in rates of revascu-larization between whites and African Americans, sosimilar functional status outcomes are not unexpected. If African Americans received worse care, we would expect them to have worse functional status, but an alternativeexplanation is that if African Americans who got worseover time died, then the surviving African Americanswould have better functional status. However, we foundno evidence of differential mortality rates ( Table I ). Another possibility is that the care given to each groupwas equivalent, but African Americans were not aschronically ill, rather they had more acute symptoms thatled to their presentation and workup. However, thispossibility is less plausible given research indicating that African-American patients are actually less likely to score positively for angina on the Rose scale. 36,37The present findings are also consistent with our own results fromother analyses of our data set where we found, among thesubset of the cohort who underwent angiography, trendsindicating that African Americans were less likely to havecoronary obstruction and had less severe coronarydisease than whites. 38Thus, to the extent that African Americans' coronary artery disease was less severe in ourcohort, their functional status should be better than whites', as demonstrated by the present results. Our analyses were limited in several ways. First, we studied only patients actively undergoing evaluation oftheir cardiac status. Those patients selected for func-tional testing and those who chose to participate in thestudy may be healthier than those in the generalpopulation, potentially biasing the findings. However,this is not likely as the functional status scores in ourpopulation at baseline indicate notably poor healthstatus overall. Our sample was representative of allnuclear imaging study patients at the included facilitiesby age and marital status, but there were fewer AfricanAmericans in the cohort than among those excluded from the study. 15Finally, the VA system cares primarily for male patients, so our results may not be generalizableto women, or to patients in non-VA settings. Strengths of our study included the fact that all facilities where patients were recruited had the capacityto conduct cardiac catheterization on-site. Unlike manyprior studies, we included individual-level controls forsociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics. Be-cause we studied VA patients, the effects of ability to payfor care, or physician financial incentives to recommendor deny procedures, were diminished. Furthermore, the sociodemographic gap between white and African- American patients is minimized in this setting. 34 These results suggest that white and African American cardiac patients who had similar functional status atbaseline and who were at a similar clinical starting point inthe VA system received similar treatment and experiencedsimilar or better functional status outcomes on mostdimensions, whether or not we included perceptions ofdiscrimination, negative affect, optimism, or magnitude ofischemia in our models. The absolute racial difference inrevascularization rates was very small (among the full cohort), and we found largely similar functional status outcomes over a 1-year period, with the observed differ-ences in outcomes indicating that African Americans faredslightly better, with only 1 exception. Thus, althoughAfrican Americans and whites did not receive identicalcare, the few differences in outcomes suggest that, inthis case, different care was not bdisparate Qcare. 39 Dr Kressin is a Research Career Scientist, Depart- ment of Veterans Affairs, Health Services Research andDevelopment Service at the Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial Veterans Hospital; Dr Petersen was an Associate in the Career Development Award Programof the Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans HealthAdministration, Health Services Research and Devel-opment Service at the time that this work wasconducted (Grant no.

Developing these skills is paramount for trainees and junior faculty. Although career development issues related to overall 'gestalt 'concerns 1, general career building advice2,3, and strategies for obtaining funding4have been previously addressed, there has been little published about strategies for maximizing one 's focus and efficiency as a clinical or health services researcher5. In this article, we offer a set of such strategies for junior investigators. First, Know Thyself (The Person) We begin with a central guiding principle: understanding thegoals, needs, and personal characteristics we bring to ourcareers is critical to making career decisions and selectingstrategies to maximize efficiency and focus. Understanding Your Values and Their Relative Priority. We all balance competing demands of work against personalcommitments. The relative priority of these demands varies at different times in our lives, and explicitly recognizing their relative importance is essential. Further, it is important toclarify one 's roles and what they require. How do you allocateyour work time across research, teaching, and clinical activities? What are your familial responsibilities (both situational and ongoing)? A ttaining a workable balance between one 's career and family life is vital to success and satisfaction in each dimension, and reserving time to 'sharpen the saw ' 6\u2014to rest, reflect, exercise, restore energy and perspective \u2014is vital to having a full reservoir of energy and drive for continuing one 's work. We recommend you literally write down a \"values \"state- ment, indicating what is important to you in each aspect of your life (personal, family, community, career). This can helpwith explicating your relative priorities and with providing guidance for how to balance time among those different aspects and within each dimension. Understanding Your Work Style, and Your Strengths and Weaknesses. Some people can adhere to internal deadlines by themselves; others need an external deadline or to beaccountable to others (e.g., a mentor). Some investigatorsthrive on multi-tasking; ot hers need to complete tasks serially. Some individuals are natural leaders; others are not. Some prefer large projects with complex multidisciplinaryteams; others prefer smaller projects. Understanding what strengths we \"bring to the table \"helps maximize efficiency as we identify collaborators and resources that complement ourstrengths. The key is to recognize your values, work style, skills and limitations and then structure work activities based on this self-assessment. Mentors, supervisors, and trustedcolleagues can help you identify your strengths and weaknesses and offer strategies to maximize focus and efficiency. Be Clear on Your Goals. Academic medicine includes a range of activities including research, teaching, clinical activities, and mentoring; it is important to understand which dimensions are most and least satisfying. One strategy for clarifying this isto take your \"affective temperature \"during different activities; identifying those which you enjoy or look forward to the mostJGIM Received April 10, 2007 Revised August 1, 2007Accepted August 6, 2007Published online August 24, 2007 1475can help you make decisions about your priorities. Whichever you choose, be constantly mindful of your long-term goals and identify realistic short and intermediate milestones consistentwith these goals. Develop a Gantt chart and/or \"to do \"list to organize goals and tasks and insure that your time commitments are consistent with your priorities. Using suchtools to organize a timeline can help you scan the horizon for upcoming commitments, tasks, and deadlines, and help you determine whether to take on additional commitments. Yourtimeline must be updated regularly, especially if your long-term goals change. You must discipline yourself to meet your deadlines, even informal ones. For example, it is easy to delay submitting amanuscript that is not perfect. However, \"perfection is the enemy of the good \", and at the point of diminishing returns, a paper should be submitted. Rewarding the completion of suchtasks can give personal satisfaction and help reinforce com- pletion of the next goal. We caution you, however, to not lose the forest for the trees \u2014publications and funding are a means to an end, and a fulfilling career will be determined by work driven by values, and by progress towards vision, not by the number of publications and grants. Organizing One 's Schedule. We recommend creating and following a schedule, including scheduling time to write grants and manuscripts. The schedule should reflect your values, strengths, and weaknesses, and work style, as well asthe urgency and importance of each task 5. For example, if you write more effectively in the morning, protect this time for writing. From an efficiency standpoint, it may be morebeneficial to arise 1 h earlier each day to write for an hour, than to spend three evening hours trying unsuccessfully to concentrate when one is tired from the day. Second, Know Thy Environment (The Environment) We all work in environments with formal and informal rules,expectations, and resources. Strategies for learning these rules have been covered in detail 2; one must learn the rules and culture of one 's specific environment so as to clearly under- stand what is valued, the metrics by which success is judged, and resources available to support one 's career (e.g., pilot funds, professional development seminars). Mentors, super-visors, and other experienced investigators are critical to understanding the local environment. Within your environment, identify mentors and potential collaborators. We advise you to query trainees and other juniorfaculty regarding strengths and weaknesses of potential mentors and collaborators before establishing working rela- tionships 2. It is also important to identify resources to help build your portfolio and career. We urge you to 'think outside the box 'to actively identify such resources, whether or not they seem available or have been offered to you. Once identified, youshould aim to develop skills at negotiating for those resources. Some are better than others at negotiating 7, so if necessary, strive to develop such skills8,9. Funded faculty with available data sets, analysts and statistical resources can often help pave the way for publica- tions and ideas for new funding proposals, which may be moreefficient than starting a study from the beginning. It isimportant to identify potential mentors and co-investigatorswho have a track record of following through with projects \u2014 evidence of a successful publication record, a continued funding stream, and successful former mentees are each signsof a desirable mentors and colleagues. It is sometimes difficult to find a single mentor to provide both content and methodological expertise. One can oftenlearn from mentors with clinical or health services research skills, even if their focus differs from yours. With creativity, you can organize a mentoring team that capitalizes on localexpertise and resources that will support development of yourcore interests. Your mentoring team can include a senior investigator whose time is more limited, coupled with a more junior investigator. You may seek one or more externalmentors with specific technical or content expertise. You also might identify opportunities to participate as a site collabora- tor in a relevant multi-site study. Here, you could buildrelationships with mentors, add on small grants, or write papers that amplify the study beyond its main products. Regardless of the specific strategy, choose mentors andcolleagues whose personal characteristics complement your own. Developing successful ment oring relationships is hard work. Mentees must learn when to ask for help and developfocused agendas for meetings to respect mentor time. Effective mentees are also able to disagree with their mentors, while remaining open-minded. If you disagree with your mentor,pose an alternative. We advise against either blindly sticking to your own perspective or applying answers from your mentor that you do not believe in; rather, you should develop skills indiscussing your concerns and finding common ground. If you find yourself feeling criticized or overwhelmed by your mentor 's responses, talk to others. This will help you gain perspectiveand ensure that you are not taking critiques of your workpersonally. Generally, a much greater cause for alarm is not being adequately critiqued. You should identify local resources for junior investigators by querying your mentors, senior faculty, and office of research administration. Many medical schools have intramural junior faculty research funding to support pilot work preparatory to agrant proposal, or to provide initial funding for a program of research which can later be leveraged into more substantial funding. Third, Determine What You Need to Succeed (Person -Environment Fit) Our recommendations are designed to help you maximize the fit between yourself and your environment. When such \"Person -Environment Fit \"is not optimal, \"strain...develops when there is a discrepancy between the demands of the joband the ability of persons to meet those demands \" 10, which saps needed energy away from doing your work. Armed with knowledge about yourself and your environment, you and yourmentor can identify strategies to enhance your success. Perhaps you spend too much time on administrative tasks, which others can perform-learning to identify persons to whomto delegate, and then to actually delegate such tasks, is an essential survival skill. Perhaps you devote too much time to nonresearch activities, including committee assignments,teaching or clinical activities. Learning to protect one 's time is essential, and this is often a challenge if \"opportunities \"are1476 Kressin et al.: Career and Time Management Strategies for Clinical and Health Services Researchers JGIMpresented by someone with direct authority over you. Mentors are essential to helping junior investigators decide what is reasonable. Manage Volume. We recommend careful thought and constant vigilance regarding your work volume. Taking on too many tasks and responsibilities inevitably leads to missed deadlines, personal frustration, and disappointment from mentors,colleagues and superiors. Thus, it is best to manage this volume at the outset, by making careful and thoughtful decisions about what to take on. To make these decisions,one must constantly refer back to one 's mission and goals, and how well each possible activity fits within this framework. If necessary, you may need to offload activities through delegation, or remove activities from your portfolio. In doingthis, it is useful to consult your mentor or supervisor, to ensure that you are considering not only your immediate needs but also your career interests and those of your institution. Learn How to Say \"No\".Knowing when to say \"no\"and developing skills to do so are crucial to managing work volume. Remember that your time is valuable, and time spent in low priority activities (even when they are \"opportunities \" from your superiors) detracts from your ability to engage intasks that are critical for your career. Chin encouraged postponing commitment-making whenever possible, to allow one to think carefully before responding (Figure 1). Thus, following his advice, we urge you to rehearse the response: \"Thank you for asking but let me think about it and get back to you \"so as to give yourself enough time to discern if a newcommitment fits your priorities. In doing so, think about the political realities of the environment \u2014whether doing something will help your center, department, or group \u2014and whether it is important to being a good citizen, or whether it is someone else 's turn to step up for such activities. Engaging one 's mentor/chief to\"play the heavy \"can be a useful way of saying no, or providing a reason for saying no (e.g. \"My mentor advised me against participating in this project \") when it is politically difficult. Minimize Switching Costs. 'Switching costs 'are those associated with excessive multitasking in which switching back and forthbetween projects incurs significant losses of time and energy associated with refamiliarizing oneself with a prior project, remembering where one left off, and organizing a new set ofpapers and files 11. We encourage minimizing switching costs by focusing primarily on high priority tasks each day or week. The oft-given advice to focus one 's efforts within a certain research content area partly stems from the recognition of the intellectual switching costs involved in mastering multiple content domains (as well as the fact that lack of focus slowsone's progress towards building a national reputation in a specific area). However, sometimes, we must switch tasks: for example, from manuscript to grant proposal preparation; in such cases it becomes important to minimize the switching costs. How one does this depends upon one 's personality. Some work more effectively by designating entire days for certain activities (e.g., Wednesdays are 'meeting days ', Thursdays are 'writing days '). Others are comfortable switching tasks after shorter periods. There is no one right answer; you must uncover the strategy that works best for you, and apply it ina way that minimizes wasted time. 1. Does it fit your mission and agenda? Is the opportunity something you are excited or passionate about? 2. What impact will you have? Do you have skills and perspectives that will be a valuable contribution, and do you have the resources to accomplish the goal? 3. What is the time commitment? Can you offload undesireable parts of the task, and will you have administrative support to complete it? 4. Can you make it more academic? Is the opportunity purely service or are there academic possibilities that might lead to a publication opportunity? 5. Can you say no or negotiate the responsibility? Are you pulling your fair share of the weight? Is there an alternative service obligation that more closely fits your interests? 6. How stable is your research program and/or funding streams? The weaker your funding and power base, the more you need to concentrate upon shoring this up before taking on new responsibilities. 7. How stable is your family/personal situation? If you just had a baby or have ill parents, it might be better to wait for future o pportunities (more will alwa ys come). Figure 1 . When to Say Yes and when to Say No (reprinted and excerpted with permission from Marshall Chin, MD, MPH, and the Society of General Internal Medicine \"Forum\" publication)1477 Kressin et al.: Career and Time Management Strategies for Clinical and Health Services Researchers JGIMVarious strategies can help minimize switching costs. When stopping work on a project, leave a 'to do 'list for your return, thereby minimizing the need to rethink where you left off whenyou reinitiate that project. Always document and date your work, so that if an unexpected interruption to the project occurs, you can more easily reconstruct where you left off andwhere you need to begin again. Having a written overall project work plan, or \"to do \"list, helps the sequence of tasks remain clear even if interrupted. Regardless of strategies, maintain anupdated \"to do \"list with deadlines, and review this list with mentors. In addition, conside r scanning documents to create electronic, rather than paper, folders, which can be more easily searched using search engines when materials need to be located. Minimize Interruptions. A common interruption is email, which can be ubiquitous and overwhelming. Consider dealing withemails during 1 -2 blocks per day. Similar strategies can be adopted from other potential distracters. You might ask to be paged only in emergencies, requesting that nonurgent clinicalor other calls be directed to your voice mail. Then, return pagesand calls once or twice a day. Try to avoid being called into impromptu meetings. If acceptable in your workplace, consider working somewhere where you will be harder to find, forexample, the library. In addition, endeavor to minimize psychic interruptions, that is, distractions to one 's train of thought from oneself. For example, if your priority is writingthe science of a grant but you are repeatedly distracted by the many related administrative details, consider keeping a side list of administrative tasks, to which you can attend after yourwriting time. In summary, career management involves understanding and managing yourself and your environment, as well as the fit between the two. This involves prioritizing and balancingfamily and work, emphasizing your strengths and supplement- ing to counter your weaknesses, and knowing your own personal clock. Knowing your work environment will allowyou to maximize your productivity by maximizing your use of resources, minimizing switching costs, managing your work volume and learning when and how to say no. No one does thisperfectly, but we believe that striving for such balance helps one to be more successful in life.Acknowledgement: Drs.

BACKGROUND: African Americans have higher rates of hypertension and worse blood pressure (BP) control than Whites, and poorer medication adherence may contribute to this phenomenon. We explored associa-tions among patients 'race, self-reported experiences with clinicians, attitudes and beliefs about hyperten- sion, and ultimately, medication adherence, among asample with no racial disparities in BP control, todetermine what lessons we could learn from patients and providers in this setting. METHODS: We recruited 793 White and African-Amer- ican (58%) patients previously diagnosed with hyper- tension from 3 VA medical centers to participate in survey assessments of each of the above dimensions,subsequent to a primary care clinic visit. RESULTS: African-American patients 'providers were significantly more active in advising and counseling about hypertension care and medication adherence.African-American patients indicated greater knowledge or heightened awareness of the importance of control- ling their BP, but there were no race differences on asummary adherence measure. In multivariate modelsmodeling medication adherence, race was not signifi- cant, but having been told to split one 's pills, believing one's BP continues to be high, and having one 's provider discuss things to do to make it easier to take BP medications were each significantly associated with worse adherence, whereas having more confidence inone's ability to take BP medications as prescribed was associated with better adherence (all p's.02). CONCLUSION: When both physicians and patients take BP management seriously, disparities in BP adherenceand control may be reduced.KEY WORDS: physician -patient relations; patient compliance; attitude to 2007 Society of General Internal Medicine 2007;22:768 -774 BACKGROUND Hypertension affects nearly 50 million Americans,1and is more frequent among African Americans ( www.americanheart. org., cited 2000 November 2), accounting for a significant portion of racial differences in mortality2. Many patients with established hypertension have poorly controlled blood pres-sure (BP), and African Americans are disproportionately represented among this group 3. Poor medication adherence is one of the most important barriers to blood pressure control1, but there is mixed evidence as to whether African Americans are less likely to adhere to prescribed therapies than Whites4,5. Provider -patient commu- nication is an important determinant of adherence6, and poor communication is thought to contribute to worse care for African Americans and other ethnic minority individuals7,8.I n addition, patients 'beliefs and attitudes about their blood pressure, and their experiences with providers regarding BP management, may ultimately affect adherence to treatmentrecommendations 9,10. Yet little is known about how each of these dimensions varies by patient race. Such information is vital for the development of future clinical interventions to ultimately address disparities in blood pressure control. Whereas most prior studies of race, medication adherence, and hypertension care have utilized samples with racial differences in BP control, we posit that the opposite approachmight help identify factors associated with success in elimi- nating differences in BP care and outcomes. Thus, drawing from a multisite Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) samplewith no racial disparities in BP control rates, we examined thelinks between patient race, experiences with clinicians, atti- tudes and beliefs about hypertension, and ultimately, adher- ence to antihypertensive medications. We first studied patternsof interactions with clinicians and patients 'beliefs about Received June 21, 2006 Revised January 4, 2007Accepted February 27, 2007Published online March 16, 2007 768hypertension by race. Second, we examined patterns of antihypertensive medication adherence by race. Third, weevaluated whether any racial differences in interactions with clinicians or beliefs about blood pressure were related to ob- served differences in adherence. METHODS Sample Initially, we identified all White and African-American patients with outpatient diagnoses of hypertension on at least 2separate occasions in 2001 at 3 urban tertiary care Depart- ment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers (ICD9 The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of all participating facilities, and patients provided informed consent. Using this \"universe \"of 11,731 hypertensive patients from the 3 medical centers, study staff tracked patients 'primary care visits over a 14-month period, and as they presented forcare, approached 1,210 of them to request participation in the study. A total of 203 were excluded owing to their race not being African American or White ( n=18), poor mental status ( n=41), denying hypertension participation in another hyper- study ( n=6), or miscellaneous other reasons ( n=79), leaving 1,007 eligible patients. Two hundred and fourteen patients (18% of the 1,210 approached) refused to participate.Thus, 793 patients were included in the final cohort (78.7% response rate).Measures Overview. We assessed 3 primary domains of interest: 1. Patient experiences with providers, 2. Patient characteristics, includingsociodemographic factors and health beliefs, and 3.Antihypertensive medication adherence. In addition, we assessed numerous covariates that we thought were relevant to either the independent or dependent variables. Our selection ofcovariates was informed by the Health Decision Model (HDM; 11). Figure 1presents our expanded conceptualization of the factors that affect individuals 'health decisions (e.g., medication adherence), to include patient personality, preferences and knowledge, prior experiences, and social interactions (such as with physicians and family), in addition to health beliefs. 1. Experiences with providers Using questions adapted from Ockene12, we assessed the content of the doctor -patient interaction focusing on hypertension and antihypertensive medication adherence, through an exit interview with each patient after his/hervisit. Such \"Patient Exit Interviews \"(PEIs; see Table 2for items [all yes/no responses]) have been demonstrated to accurately measure the actual content of clinic visits,through comparisons of audiotapes of such interactions to patient reports 13. The question answers were summed to create 1 PEI scale score, with a range from 1 to 12 (higherscores indicate greater frequency of counseling). 2. Patient sociodemographic characteristics, and health beliefs Patients completed an interview including questions about sociodemographic characteristics: date of birth, highestgrade in school completed, employment, marital status, Patient characteristics -- Race, Age, Income, Education, Marital status -- Negative affect, optimism, functional status, comorbid conditions,com plexity of medication re gimenSocial Interaction --- with physician --- with family, friends Experience -- experiences with hypertension care -- satisfaction with VA health care; perceptions of discrimination in VA health care -- Trust in PhysicianKnowledge -- awareness of the importance of BP control -- understanding of risks/benefits of available therapies Patient Preferences -- preferences for therapy -- desired role in decision making -- perceived recommendation of physicianAttitudes and Beliefs about Hypertension -- beliefs about susceptibility to and severity of hypertension, risks and benefits of treatment -- self-efficacy regarding medication adherence Health Decision Figure 1 . The health decision model, adapted from Eraker, Kirscht, and 198412.769 Kressin et al.: Hypertensive Patients 'Health Beliefs JGIMincome, and race. We also obtained information about comorbid diagnoses and BP measurements from themedical record. Following the Health Belief Model (HBM), which posits that patients 'appraisals of disease risk (susceptibility) and severity influence the practice of health-related behav- iors 14, we assessed patients 'perceptions of the seriousness of blood pressure, and consequences resulting from nottaking BP medications (answer categories ranged from\"extremely serious \u2014a threat to one 's life ',t o \"not at all serious \"). The HBM posits that an individual 's considera- tions of the perceived barriers and incentives for performingspecific behaviors are important to consider. Thus, we asked patients if they thought BP medications would make them feel worse, or better, help them live longer, improvetheir quality of life, or prevent BP-related illnesses (all yes/ no responses). Finally, the HBM considers cues to action, which prompt individuals to act by reminding them of theneed to change their behaviors. We assessed 1 particularset of cues by asking patients if their family or friends help them to remember to take their BP medication. 3. Covariates There is evidence that trust in one 's physician, experiences of racial discrimination in the health care setting, self- efficacy (e.g., knowledge about one 's BP, and confidence in one's ability to take BP medications), complexity of one 's medical regimen, patient personality (both negative affect and optimism), and functional status might affect adher-ence. Thus, we assessed each dimension, as follows. To assess trust in one 's physician, we included the 11- item Trust in Physician scale 15, which assesses the extent to which patients feel their doctor cares about him/her, isconsiderate of his/her needs, tells the truth, and makes good judgments. The patients were asked to respond to each statement on a 5-point scale (1=totally agree; 5=totally disagree). Appropriate items were reverse coded and the answers to these questions were summed and converted to a 100-point scale, so higher scores repre-sented greater trust. To assess patients 'experiences of racial discrimination in the health care setting, we includ- ed the \"Experiences of Discrimination \"scale. Item responses were summed and converted to a 100-pointscale so that higher scores indicate less discrimination 16. To assess self-efficacy, we asked patients how confident they were about their knowledge about BP and how to dealwith it, and in their ability to take their BP medication as prescribed (0=not confident at all; 10=totally confident) 6. To assess the complexity of a patient 's medication regi- men17, we asked patients how many different types of BP pills they take, how many times each day they take it, and whether they were told to split their pills. NegativeAffectivity (NA) was measured with the EPI-Q 18. Optimism was assessed with the Life Orientation Test19. We included a broad generic measure of functional status, the VR-12(the SF-12 adapted for veterans; 20), which provides a mental component summary scale (MCS) and a physical component summary scale (PCS). Outcome Assessment -Antihypertensive Medication Adherence. We asked patients to self-report their medication adherence, using items from 2 well-validated measures fromthe literature to assess multiple dimensions of medication adherence. Following Choo et al.21, we assessed how many days in the past week patients forgot to take their blood pressure medication (0, 1, 2 or more days), how many days they did not take their medication on purpose (0, 1, 2, or more days), howmany days they added an extra pill (0, 1, 2, or more days), whether they ever took less medicine because they felt they needed less (yes or no), and following Morisky et al. 22we asked, \"sometimes if you feel worse when you take the medicine, do you stop taking it? \"(yes or no). Finally, we asked, \"Some people have difficulty taking blood pressure medication as prescribed. Do you have difficulty with this? \"(yes or no). We evaluated several different methods for combining these items, assessing the validity of each possible summary mea- sure by examining its association with blood pressure control,choosing the measure with the strongest association. Thus, our final measure of adherence included the items assessing forgetting to take medications, not taking medications onpurpose, taking less medications because of perceptions thatone needed less, and having difficulties taking medications as prescribed. We specified that the patient must answer posi- tively to at least 1 of the items to be considered as havingadherence problems. We calculated this variable only for those who answered all of these questions. For the variables with 3 responses, a person was considered adherent if he/sheindicated adherence problems for 0 day or 1 day each week, and nonadherent if he/she indicated adherence problems for 2 or more days; the other questions had yes/no responses(adherence problems or not). Statistical Analyses. We first examined whether there were racial differences in interactions with clinicians, in patients ' beliefs and attitudes regarding hypertension, or in medicationadherence, using bivariate analyses of each variable by race (chi square or ttests, as appropriate). Next, we performed bivariate analyses to determine which sociodemographicvariables, health beliefs, and PEI items and other covariate scales were associated with the dichotomous adherence summary outcome. We then conducted stepwise analyses Table 1.

In the final step, using PROC LOGISTIC for the binary adherence outcome, weincluded all significant variables from the prior stepwise analysis, into the multivariate regression model (race and site of care were included in the final model regardless of theirsignificance in prior analyses). All analyses were conducting using SAS 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). RESULTS White patients were older (67.3 vs 64.4,) and more likely to be married (54.5 vs 37.4, both p's<.0001; (Table 1)). African Americans had a lower frequency of coronary artery disease diagnoses (43% vs 53%), but nearly twice the rate of renal disease(31% vs 17%), and higher rates of tobacco use (21% vs 15%; all p's<.05). African-American and White patients were equally likely to have a blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg(54% vs 57%, p=.41). Race was differentially distributed across sites, with the proportion of African Americans ranging from 42% (St. Louis), to 56% (Philadelphia), to 77% (Chicago; 58%overall). To account for these differences across sites, site wasincluded as a covariate in all models. Adherent patients were 1.5 times more likely to have controlled BP than nonadherent patients, after controlling for comorbid conditions, BMI, age,and site of care ( p=.0433; results not shown). There were important bivariate racial differences on each of the 3 primary dimensions assessed (Table 2). Patient -provider interactions. African Americans (AA) reported that their providers were more active in counseling and advising them about BP, with a higher total patient exit interview scorethan Whites (6.6 vs 5.8, p<.01), indicating that AAs 'providers asked about 1 more question on average regarding BP. However, Whites '(W) providers were more likely to request a follow-up appointment for BP care (67% vs 60%, p=.05). Whereas relatively high rates of patients of both races ( 80%) reported that doctors discussed BP and its management with them, only about a third of patients reported that providers explicitly discussed barriers toBP medication adherence, and only about 10% of patients reported that their providers provided them with written materials about BP (although AA patients more often reportedthat their doctors had done so: 12% vs 7%). African Americansreported that their doctors more often discussed other health problems that might result from high BP (68% vs 53%), whether they take their medications as prescribed (88% vs 82%), howimportant medications are for controlling BP (85% vs 78%), anddiscussed things to do to make it easier to take BP medications (39% vs 28%; all p's<.05). Patients 'beliefs about BP and BP medications. Whereas there were some similarities in perceptions about BP medications,AAs were more likely to report that BP medications would make them feel better, and to rate high BP as a more serious health concern ( p's.01; Table 2). There were no significant racial differences in patients 'perceptions of whether their BP is under good control. Medication adherence. African Americans were less adherent on 3 of the 6 single items assessing adherence (more likely tostop taking medications if one feels worse; not taking medication on purpose, and forgetting to take medications [allp's<.05]; Table 2). However, such differences remained only at the trend level on the summary adherence variable (74% vs 80%, p=.10). Covariates. With regard to medication regimen complexity, there were no racial differences in patients being told to splitpills (on average, approximately 30% of both groups were told to do so) or in the number of times per day BP medications were taken. However, African Americans were taking 2.2 typesof medications versus Whites '1.9 (p=.002). African Americans felt more knowledgeable about their BP and how to deal with it, and had better physical and mental functioning. Finally,African Americans were more likely to have experienced racialTable 2.

Last, we calculated a multivariate logistic regression model for self-reported adherence (Table 3). Confidence in one 's ability to take medications as prescribed was associated with better adherence ( p<.0001). However, patient perception that one's BP continues to be high was associated with worse adherence (p=.006), as were having the provider discuss things the patient can do to make it easier to take BP medications ( p=.006) and being told to split one 's pills ( p=.016). DISCUSSION This study is among the first to simultaneously examine racial differences in patients 'experiences with physicians, attitudes and beliefs about hypertension and antihypertensive medica- tion, and the association of each of these dimensions withpatients 'antihypertensive medication adherence. In our sam- ple with similar BP control among Whites and African Amer- icans, we found that African Americans believed BP to be a more serious health threat, suggesting that public health, VAsystem-wide, and clinician-provided messages about the sig- nificance of high BP, especially among African Americans, seem to be reaching their target. These results also suggestthat African Americans are receiving enhanced BP care \u2014their physicians counseled them more about blood pressure and prescribed more medications for their BP. Thus, these VAproviders seem to have received and acted upon the message regarding poorer outcomes for African-American patients with hypertension. We conclude that such methods and strategies,when used by clinicians, may positively influence patients ' beliefs about antihypertensive medications. Our findings differ from previous reports about racial/ ethnic differences in specific knowledge and beliefs abouthypertension 23,24, and suggest that in the VA setting, African Americans perceive BP to be a more serious threat to health than do White patients. In contrast, whereas earlier reportshad noted that White patients were more likely to be counseled about hypertension by their providers 25, our findings suggest the opposite dynamic is occurring in the VA. Our study was limited in several ways. First, we only studied regular users of the VA care system, which may have biased our sample toward more adherent patients (e.g., appointmentkeepers). However, we still observed a range of adherencebehaviors. Also, the VA system cares primarily for male patients, so our results may not be generalizable to women, or to patients in non-VA settings. Further, racial disparities inhealth care may be minimized in the VA setting 26, which could limit our ability to generalize these findings. These results suggest that several patient health beliefs and practices are associated with adherence, although we were unable to determine the causal direction of the associations. The fact that a patient 's understanding that his blood pressure was high was negatively associated with adherence, as werereports of providers counseling about medication taking suggests that providers may have been working harder with patients with harder-to-control BP, or with patients who didnot seem to be adherent. Notably, patients with greater perceived self-efficacy in medication taking had better adherence. Such beliefs can befostered by primary care providers during clinic visits, using strategies developed for patient-centered counseling 12. Clin- icians can ask open-ended questions of their patients aboutmedication adherence such as, \"What kinds of problems are you having taking your blood pressure medications? \"Then, using barriers identified by the patients, clinicians can help tostrategize ways to address such barriers, thus enhancing patients 'self-efficacy, and adherence. Indeed, our prior work has demonstrated that there is room for improvement inprimary care clinicians 'antihypertensive medication adher- ence counseling skills 27. African Americans are disproportionately affected by hyper- tension, with lower rates of blood pressure control in thegeneral population, although not in this VA sample. Notably, less than half of this sample overall had controlled BP, indicating much room for improvement in BP care. Ourfindings suggest that patient beliefs are significantly associat- ed with blood pressure medication adherence. Thus, we encourage providers to actively learn more about theirpatients 'beliefs about both hypertension and its therapies, to provide targeted counseling to help patients improve medica- tion adherence, and ultimately, blood pressure control.

Design Analysis of data from a prospective cohort enrolled in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to improve linkage with primary medical care. Setting An urban residential detoxication program. Participants Adults ( n=397) enrolled in the RCT with heroin, alcohol or cocaine as a substance of choice and at least one follow-up interview. Measurements The key independent variable was pain status: persistent pain (moderate to very severe pain at all available interviews), no pain (mild pain or less at all available interviews) and intermittent pain(all others). There were four outcomes of interest: self-reported use of any substance; heroin/opioid use; heavy alcoholuse; and cocaine use 24 months after detoxication. Multivariable logistic regression controlled for several covariatesincluding demographics, physical/sexual abuse, depressive symptoms, duration of follow-up and addiction severity atstudy entry . Findings Pain in detoxication patients was common; 16% had persistent pain and 54% had intermittent pain. Persistent pain was associated with an increased odds for use of any substance [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 4.2,95% condence and (AOR CI 1.0-4.5) at the 24-month follow-up. A statistically non-signicant increase in the odds of cocaine use (AOR2.0, 95% CI 0.9-4.6) was also observed. Conclusions Among individuals leaving residential detoxication, chronic pain is a common problem and is associated independently with long-term substance use after detoxication. Address-ing pain as a treatable chronic condition among adults receiving detoxication presents a potential opportunity toimprove long-term clinical outcomes and warrants further intervention research.

Inadequate treatment of pain is aparticularly challenging problem among patients withsubstance use disorders due to the concern that opiatesfor the treatment of pain may contribute to exacerba-tion of the substance use disorder [6,7]. Indeed, appre-hension of promoting substance use has led towidespread under-treatment of pain and prejudicial care patterns [8]. There is some evidence that chronic severe pain influ- ences the drug use patterns of patients in addiction treat-ment programs. Chronic pain is generally dened asunrelenting, lasting more than 6 months and oftenoccurring after healing from disease or injury is complete[9,10]. Methadone and residential treatment patientswith chronic severe pain are more likely than patientswithout pain to report use of illicit drugs to relieve pain[1]. Trafton and colleagues [4] suggest that substanceabuse patients with chronic pain may have differentRESEARCH REPORT doi:10.1111/j.1360-0443.2007.01759.x \u00a9 2007 The Authors. Journal compilation \u00a9 2007 Society for the Study of Addiction Addiction ,102, 752-760addiction treatment needs from other substance abuse patients. In their study of 251 veterans seekingmethadone/levo-alpha-acetyl-methadol (LAAM) treat-ment, those with moderate or severe pain had greatermisuse of non-prescribed analgesic medications thanother patients, suggesting selective self-administration ofsubstances that relieve pain [4]. Despite the high prevalence of pain, and the common use of illicit drugs to remedy it, there is scant literature onthe impact of chronic pain on recovery from alcohol anddrug dependence. In a retrospective study of veterans inresidential substance abuse treatment, back pain was anindependent factor contributing to a lower probability ofcompleting treatment [4]. The presence of pain amongadults in a national sample of drug abuse treatment pro-grams was associated with poorer self-reported healthstatus at follow-up 12 months after treatment terminated[11]. As unrelieved pain is related to continued illicit drug use and leads to negative medical and psychosocial con-sequences, it is possible that pain will also affect return tosubstance use after seeking care for one's addiction.However, we found no empirical prospective studies thathave addressed whether chronic pain affects return toalcohol or drug use. In this study we examine whetherpatients with persistent pain seeking detoxication in anurban, residential program have different addictions-related outcomes in a prospective study . This studyaddresses two main questions: (1) what is the prevalenceof persistent and intermittent pain over a 2-year periodamong adults receiving residential substance abusedetoxication; and (2) is persistent or intermittentpain associated with substance use 24 months afterdetoxication? METHODS SubjectsThe study involved a prospective cohort of adults admit- ted to a freestanding urban residential alcohol and drugdetoxication unit between 1 June 1997 and 1 April1999. Patients were screened for eligibility and enrolledon their second day or later in the detoxication unit[12]. Inclusion criteria were the following: (1) heroin,alcohol or cocaine as the patient's rst or second drug ofchoice; (2) age greater than 17 years; and (3) residencein proximity to a referral primary care clinic or home-lessness. The exclusion criteria were: (1) an establishedprimary care relationship that the patient intended tocontinue; (2) cognitive impairment limiting the subject'sability to provide pertinent history (score of less than 21of 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination) [13]; (3)specic plans to leave the area in the next 12 months;(4) inability to provide three contact names for follow-up tracking; (5) pregnancy; and (6) not fluent in English orSpanish. Of 642 eligible subjects, 470 provided consentand were enrolled in the cohort. All 470 participated inthe randomized clinical trial, the Health Evaluation andLinkage to Primary care (HELP) study [12]. All subjectswere assigned randomly to receive either standardmedical care referral by clinical addictions staff on anas-needed basis (usual care) or an enhanced effort forreferral to primary medical care. This enhanced effortand the results of the clinical trial are described else-where [12]. The results reported here are from prospec-tively collected data on subjects from the HELP samplewho completed at least one follow-up interview and hadno missing covariate information ( n=388). Of 470 sub- jects in the cohort, two died before any scheduledfollow-up and 400/468 (85%) completed at least oneinterview during the 2-year follow-up period. Of the400 subjects who completed at least one follow-up inter-view, 12 were missing a value on one or more covariatesand were excluded from further analyses. White subjectswere signicantly less likely to be lost to follow-up thannon-white subjects; otherwise, subjects in this analysisdid not differ signicantly from those lost to follow-up onany other study variable [14]. Assessments After initial resolution of the symptoms of acute with- drawal, trained research associates interviewed subjectsat the detoxication unit. Assessments included: demo-graphics, substance of choice, substances used andaddiction severity [Addiction Severity Index (ASI) alcoholand drug scales] symptoms [Center forEpidemiologic Studies Depression quality of life [Short Form Health Survey(SF-36)] [17] and questions regarding primary medicalcare [12]. Except for demographics, all the assessmentswere repeated every 6 months over 24 months. Atfollow-up interviews, alcohol breath tests were performedto encourage truth telling [18]. Pain was measured byitems of the SF-36, which focuses specically on theseverity of bodily pain and resulting limitations in activi-ties [17]. Outcome variables There were four dichotomous outcomes of interest based on type of substance use at the 24-monthfollow-up interview. The outcomes were: (1) heavyalcohol use (i.e. intoxication or three or more drinks onat least 1 day); (2) cocaine use; (3) heroin/opioid use(i.e. non-therapeutic\u2014does not include prescribed painmedications or methadone); and (4) any substance use(i.e. heavy alcohol use or illicit use of cocaine orPersistent pain and substance use outcomes 753 \u00a9 2007 The Authors. Journal compilation \u00a9 2007 Society for the Study of Addiction Addiction ,102, 752-760opioids). Each outcome was self-reported and assessed using items from the alcohol and drug ASI regarding themost recent 30 days from the interview date [19].Heavy alcohol use was dichotomized as 1 if intoxicationor 3 or more drinks on at least 1 day was reported (elsezero). Similarly , for cocaine, heroin and any drug use,the dichotomous measure took on a value of 1 if therewas use on any 1 day in the past 30 days and 0 if therewas no use in the past 30 days. The 24-month measure-ment was selected as the primary outcome because theinterest was in substance use after a prolonged periodfollowing detoxication. Main independent variable The main independent variable of interest was a com- posite of the severity and duration of pain. The severityof pain was assessed using the SF-36 [17] pain item:'how much bodily pain have you had during the past4 weeks?'. One of six responses was possible: none, verymild, mild, moderate, severe and very severe. Three cat-egories were created combining severity and duration ofpain: (1) persistent pain (moderate or a higher level ofpain reported at each available interview); (2) intermit-tent pain (moderate or a higher level of pain reportedduring at least one but not all available interviews); and(3) no pain (mild or a lower level of pain reported ateach available interview). The SF-36 includes an addi-tional question relating to pain. The second item is 'howmuch did pain interfere with your normal work (includ-ing both work outside the home and housework)?', withve possible responses ranging from not at all toextremely . The two pain-related questions are combinedto form the SF-36 Bodily Pain scale (BP). Although wedo not focus upon disruption of normal work due topain in this paper, these data are also reported fordescriptive purposes. For the BP scale, a lower score indi-cates worse pain and more limitation due to pain. Therange is 0-100; the reported reliability coefcient is0.90 in normative data for the general US population[17] and is 0.87 in this study sample. Other predictor variables Additional predictor variables of interest measured at time of study entry were the following: gender; age;health insurance in the 6 months prior; self-report of life-time physical/sexualabuse; highest level of education (high school or greater);health literacy score from the Rapid Assessment of AdultLiteracy in Medicine (REALM), a 66-item literacy screen-ing instrument based on word pronunciation [20]; race/ethnicity (white or non-white); homeless (1 or morenights in a shelter or on the street in the preceding 6months); severity of alcohol and drug dependence asmeasured by the ASI alcohol and drug scores (ASI- alcohol and ASI-drug, respectively); indicator variablesfor substance of choice (heroin, alcohol or cocaine); themental component summary (MCS) score of the SF-36;depressive symptoms (CES-D) [16]; and indicator variablefor told by a doctor they had one of 13 chronic conditions[21]. Duration of follow-up was measured as 6, 12, 18 or24 to reflect the month of the last completed survey . Analysis Two analytical samples were used to assess the relation- ship of variables with substance use outcomes. Theprimary analysis included 397 subjects (3 of 400 hadmissing pain variable): 275 who completed the24-month interview and 122 subjects for whom the sub-stance use outcome obtained at the last follow-up visitwas carried forward for the 24-month outcome measure-ments; due to item missing responses, the analyticalsample was 388. A secondary analysis was conductedthat included only participants who completed the24-month follow-up interview. Bivariate associations between pain status and base- line characteristics and pain status and substance useoutcomes 24 months after detoxication were assessedusing analysis of variance (ANOV A) for continuous mea-sures and the c 2test for categorical measures. Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the association between pain status and substance use24 months after detoxication. Separate models weretted for each of the four outcome measures. The primaryand secondary analyses were adjusted for age, gender,race, unemployment, health insurance, experiencedphysical or sexual abuse, depressive symptoms, alcoholand drug severity at study entry and duration of follow-up. Regression models did not control for the presence ofa chronic medical condition as these conditions werehypothesized to be a probable source of chronic pain\u2014wewere interested in whether pain was related to substanceuse, not whether that relationship would be moderated bythe cause of the pain. Reported P-values are two-tailed, and a P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically signicant. Analyses were carried out using SAS/STATsoftware, version 8.2. [22]. Two conrmatory analyses were conducted to assess the sensitivity of results to using alternative measures forthe following covariates: alcohol and drug use at studyentry (drug of choice instead of ASI alcohol and drugscores); mental health status (SF-36 MCS instead ofdepressive symptoms). Additional models were also ttedto assess whether homelessness, health literacy or educa-tional level were confounding factors. A nal exploratoryanalysis was conducted to assess whether adjusting forsubstance use outcome at 6-month follow-up changed754 Mary Jo Larson et al. \u00a9 2007 The Authors. Journal compilation \u00a9 2007 Society for the Study of Addiction Addiction ,102, 752-760the association between pain status and substance use outcomes. RESULTS Subject characteristicsOf the 397 subjects eligible for this prospective cohort study , the majority was male (76%), lacked health insur-ance (61%), was employed in the 6 months prior tostudy entry (62%), had experienced physical or sexualabuse (71%), completed a high school education ormore (70%), identied as black, Hispanic or anotherminority group (66%) and demonstrated health literacyequivalent to 9th grade or above (i.e. REALM score 61or greater) (54%). Mean age was 36.0 (SD 7.7) .More than 46% had at least 1 day of homelessness (on thestreet or in a shelter) in the 6 months prior to studyentry (Table 1).Almost half the subjects reported at least one chronic medical condition (48%) (Table 2). The substance ofchoice was heroin for about one-quarter of subjects, alco-hol for more than one-third of subjects and cocaine/crackfor one-third of subjects. Average ASI-alcohol and drugcomposite scores at baseline were 0.47 and 0.26, respec-tively . Measures of mental health status were indicative ofhigh depressive symptoms (CES-D, mean 33.1, SD 12.5),where >16 is suggestive of a possible depressive disorder, and low mental health status (SF-36 MCS mean 31.5, SD12.7) where the US population norm is 50. Several bivariate associations were statistically signi- cant between baseline demographic characteristicsand pain status (i.e. persistent, intermittent, no pain)(Table 1). Pain status differed by all demographic charac-teristics except education, homelessness (marginal sig-nicance) and health literacy . Subjects classied withpersistent pain were more likely than other subjects to beTable 1 Demographic characteristics of residential detoxication patients by pain sign. *Persistent painIntermittent n 397 64 214 119 Gender (%) P<0.001 Male 75.6 14.3 50.7 35.0Female 24.4 21.7 63.9 14.3 Age, mean (SD) 36.0 (7.7) 39.0 (8.4) 36.1 (7.6) 34.2 (7.1) P<0.001 Health (%) Yes 39.3 25.6 55.8 18.6No 10.0 38.0 21.2 59.6 19.2No 62.0 13.0 P=0.02 Yes 71.1 16.4 57.5 26.1No 28.9 14.9 44.7 40.4 Education (%) P=0.868 Less than high school 29.9 15.3 55.9 28.8High school graduate 70.1 16.6 53.1 30.3 Health literacy (%) P=0.20 Low (0-44) 13.8 11.5 53.9 9.9 57.0 33.1 Homeless (%) P=0.09 Yes 46.8 20.4 51.1 28.5No 53.2 12.3 56.4 31.3 Duration of follow-up, median 22.0 23.5 23.4 P=0.02 *F-statistic for means; Kruskall-Wallis test for medians.1Based on all interviews in a 24-month period.Persistent pain and substance use outcomes 755 \u00a9 2007 The Authors.

A total of 275 (69%) subjects had the last observation measured at the 24-month follow-up interview;24-month completers were 67% of the no pain group,73% of the intermittent pain group, and 59% of the per-sistent pain group.

Persistent painwas observed in 16% of subjects. The observed proportions of subjects reporting sub- stance use 24 months after detoxication were 43% forreturn to heavy alcohol use, 26% for cocaine use, 23% forheroin/opioid use and 60% for any illicit drug or heavyalcohol use. Bivariate associations also existed between pain status and several health status indicators measured at studyentry . Subjects with at least one chronic medical condi-tion, those reporting alcohol or heroin as the rst sub-stance of choice, and those with more depressivesymptoms (CES-D) and worse mental health (SF-36mental component summary score), were more likely toreport pain (Table 2). In unadjusted analyses (Table 2), pain status was associated with any substance use and heroin/opioid useoutcomes. Of subjects with persistent pain, 80% reportedany 34% heroin/opioid use, 56% heavyalcohol use and 33% cocaine use (not mutually exclusive)(data not shown). Relative to the group with no pain, thepersistent pain group had a signicantly increased oddsof any substance [odds ratio (OR) 2.3-9.3], heroin/opioid (OR 2.1, CI 1.1-3.9) use; a non-signicantincrease in the odds of cocaine use (OR 1.7, CI 0.9-3.4)was also observed. Relative to the group with no pain, theintermittent pain group had an increased odds of anysubstance use (OR 1.8, CI 1.2-2.9) and heroin/opioid use(OR 2.8, CI 1.4-5.3).Adjusted analyses In adjusted models, the association between pain status and outcomes remained (Table 3). Relative to the groupwith no pain, the persistent pain group had a signi-cantly increased odds of any substance use (adjustedodds ratio (AOR) 4.2, CI 1.9-9.3), heroin or other opioiduse (AOR 5.4, CI 2.1-13.8) and heavy alcohol use (AOR2.1, CI 1.0-4.5); a non-signicant increase in the odds ofcocaine use (AOR 2.05, CI 0.9-4.6) was also observed.Relative to the group with no pain, the intermittent paingroup had an increased odds of any substance use (AOR1.7, CI 1.1-2.9) and heroin/opioid use (AOR 2.6, CI 1.2-5.3) but not heavy alcohol use (AOR 1.3, CI 0.8-2.3) orcocaine use (AOR 1.1, CI 0.6-2.0). Females had reduced odds of heavy alcohol use and any substance use. Having health insurance was associ-ated with increased odds of any substance use. Older agewas associated with reduced odds of heavy alcohol use. The ndings were not sensitive to other model speci- cations that were tested. Models tted with alternativemeasures of alcohol and drug use and mental healthstatus at study entry and models including omitted vari-ables (homelessness, health literacy and educationallevel) produced comparable results for the association ofpain status. In addition, when analyses were repeated onthe subset of subjects who completed the 24-monthfollow-up interview, the main ndings did not changefrom the primary analysis. The data are not presented forthese additional covariate and conrmatory analyses.

The intermittent pain group had non-signicantly increased odds of any substance use (AOR1.45, CI 0.8-2.7) and heroin or other opioid use (AOR1.1, CI 0.5.-2.5). DISCUSSION More than half the urban adult population seeking detoxication from drugs and alcohol reported moderateto very severe pain upon entry to a residential program,and for about one-third of those with pain reports thepain was persistent for up to 2 years. The extent to whichthe presence of persistent pain or even intermittent painwas associated with an increase in the odds of substanceuse after detoxication was notable. While it has beenreported previously that pain is prevalent in substanceusing addiction treatment populations, little prior empiri-cal evidence demonstrated that chronic pain has an inde-pendent role in hindering recovery from substancedependence in patients seeking help. These ndings are consistent with the high level of pain reports in studies conducted in veterans' methadonetreatment clinics extend prior knowledge with prospective data collec-tion documenting that for one-third of the populationmoderate/severe pain continues over a 2-year period. Some pain reports while in detoxication care may be associated with withdrawal and not require any furtherintervention. The withdrawal hypothesis was exploredexplicitly in samples entering methadone and residentialprograms by Rosenblum et al. [1], and withdrawal was not found to be a major contributor to pain prevalence. Inthis study , the mean bodily pain score did improve duringthe 6 months immediately after detoxication. However,mean bodily pain scores from 6 months to 24 monthswere stable (between 66 and 69) and thus remainedmuch more severe than the normative pain level of theUS population of similar age. In the long term, pain levelswere less severe than two US samples with published nor-mative data (back pain and depression). It has been suggested previously that co-occurring pain and substance use disorders could complicate thetreatment of substance use disorders [4,23]; this studyprovides empirical evidence in support of this idea. Thereare other reasons that treatment centers and detoxica-tion programs should be aware of pain problems and seekadequate care for patients with moderate and severe pain. Severe pain is indicative of other chronic disorders requir-ing treatment such as HIV , and can contribute indepen-dently to reduced functioning among those with chronicmedical conditions [24,25]. In a longitudinal study ofcommunity-dwelling older adults, problem drinkersreported more frequent use of alcohol to manage painthan did non-problem drinkers and had more chronichealth problems and recent serious injury at 3-yearfollow-up [26]. The current clinical practice literature in this area focuses on the management of acute and chronic painamong patients with a history of opioid abuse, and thesignicant risk of recurrent opioid abuse in such patientswhen opioids are part of medical treatment [6,7,27,28].The ndings of the current study highlight an additionalcountervailing risk: namely , that under-treatment ofpain may itself be a signicant factor in recurrent opioidabuse. Further, these ndings suggest that chronic pain isan issue that should also be addressed among alcohol-dependent people, as addiction treatment outcomes wereobserved to be worse due to persistent pain for both opioidand alcohol use. Several limitations of the study should be noted. First, we do not address, nor did we ask subjects about, thesource of pain. Understanding the source of pain isimportant for tailoring an appropriate clinical responseand may influence the odds of substance use after detoxi-cation. We also could not incorporate additional mea-sures relevant to the management of chronic pain.Insights gained from instruments such as the TreatmentOutcomes of Pain Survey or brief pain index [29,30] canbe useful to guide management as can measures forascertaining patients' perceptions of whether their druguse was motivated in part by seeking pain relief [1]. Wedo not believe that opioid 'pseudoaddiction' (i.e. mistakesin presuming patients have addiction when indeed theyare using drugs to seek adequate pain management)explains these ndings, in part because we foundincreased likelihood of any substance use and heavyalcohol use after detoxication, not simply heroin use. Secondly , there is a complex relationship that exists between pain, early return to substance use and long-term substance use that we were not able to study thor-oughly . Exploratory analyses we conducted support thecontention that return to substance use at 6-monthfollow-up may , in part, mediate the association betweenpersistent and intermittent pain with long-term sub-stance use. In addition, hyperalgesia might explain thehigh prevalence of both chronic pain and long-term sub-stance use. There also are other plausible covariates notcaptured in this analysis. For example, there is a highprevalence of co-occurring anxiety , pain and substanceuse; while this study did capture childhood sexual and758 Mary Jo Larson et al. \u00a9 2007 The Authors. Journal compilation \u00a9 2007 Society for the Study of Addiction Addiction ,102, 752-760physical abuse as a stressor and included a measure of depressive symptoms, we did not measure anxiety symp-toms [2,31,32]. Thirdly , because the primary analysis carried forward the substance use reports from the last observation for122 of the 397 sample observations, it is plausible thatdifferential loss to follow-up influenced study ndings.However, we do not expect that the association of dura-tion of follow-up and pain categories explains these nd-ings. In addition to adjusting for duration of follow-up inthe primary analyses, the results from a secondary analy-sis that included only subjects who completed the24-month follow-up were not substantially different fromthe main ndings. Fourthly , it is possible that we misclas-sied pain status for subjects who did not complete all fourpossible follow-up interviews. For example, subjects whocompleted three interviews and were categorized ashaving persistent pain could have been classied ashaving intermittent pain if they had completed four inter-views. Misclassication of pain status, as described,would bias the ndings towards the null hypothesis.Further, we did not ask subjects if they had been treatedfor pain symptoms, so we cannot assess directly whetherthe high prevalence of pain reflects the absence or inad-equacy of pain treatment. However, it is possible that mostsubjects were not involved with any regular source of paintreatment. At study entry all of the cohort lacked a sourceof primary medical care; while the majority linked with aprimary medical care source during the course of thestudy [14], 36.8% received no primary care visits and13.5% received a total of only one visit in the 2-yearperiod [33]. Fifthly , the subjects in this study may notgeneralize to other groups of substance abuse treatmentsamples. In particular, the rate of depressive symptoms inthis sample may be higher than in other substance abusesamples. The mean CES-D score in this sample is similar toone study where all patients had comorbid psychiatricand substance use disorders [34], but much higher than asecond study of 12 residential treatment programs [35].In this second study symptom reports may have beenlower as measurement occurred 15 days after admission[36], rather than in the rst few days as with this study .Finally , although the study was prospective, using thesedata we cannot determine whether the presence ofchronic pain contributed to the development of an addic-tive disorder or whether the history of drug use behaviorscontributed in some way to risk of developing painfulconditions, as can occur with HIV/AIDS, chronic venousinsufciency or hyperalgesia. None the less, regardless ofthis etiological question, the presence of pain was a riskfactor for substance use after detoxication. The ndings that persistent pain among people with substance use disorders is associated with recurrentalcohol and opioid use suggest clinical approaches thatcould potentially enhance the effectiveness of substance use services. The implication of this study is that clini-cians and researchers should pay additional attention tothe management of chronic pain for individuals withsubstance dependence. Treatment centers, detoxicationprograms and primary care physicians should be aware ofpain problems and seek adequate care for patients withmoderate to very severe pain. Furthermore, the currentstudy provides new empirical evidence that co-occurringpain and substance use disorders could complicate thetreatment of substance use disorders. Chronic painwould be a fruitful area for future research to conrmthese ndings in other treatment settings and considerinterventions to address the problem. Addressing thecomorbidities of pain and substance dependence willrequire coordination of care between general medicaland substance use providers. In many cases this willinvolve linking patients with substance use disorderswith primary medical care or other care providers inwhich adequate resources and expertise for chronic painmanagement exist. One successful intervention for peoplewith concurrent chronic pain and a substance use disor-der integrated cognitive-behavioral treatment of painmanagement and relapse prevention [37]. Attending to apatient's pain makes good medical sense and is oneavenue by which to potentially improve the quality ofaddiction treatment.

BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with medical and psychological morbidity.The prevalence of PTSD in urban primary care has not been well described. OBJECTIVE: To measure the prevalence of PTSD in primary care patients overall and among those withselected conditions (chronic pain, depression, anxiety, heavy drinking, substance dependence (SD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and immigrant status). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: English-speaking patients aged 18 - 65 years old, awaiting primary care appointments in an urban academic medical center, were eligible forenrollment to determine PTSD prevalence ( N=509). Additional eligible participants ( n=98) with IBS or SD were subsequently enrolled. MEASUREMENTS: PTSD (past year) and trauma expo- sure were measured with Composite International Diagnostic Interview. We calculated the prevalence of PTSD associated with depression, anxiety, heavy drink-ing, SD, IBS, and chronic pain. Only the analyses on heavy drinking, SD, and IBS used all 607 participants. RESULTS: Among the 509 adults in primary care, 23% (95% CI, 19 -26%) had PTSD, of whom 11% had it noted in the medical record. The prevalence of PTSD, adjusted for age, gender, race, and marital and socioeconomic status- es, was higher in participants with, compared to thosewithout, the following conditions: chronic pain (23 vs 12%, p=.003), major depression (35 vs 11%, p<.0001), anxiety disorders (42 vs 14%, p<.0001), and IBS (34 vs 18%, p=.01) and lower in immigrants (13 vs 21%, p=.05).CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of PTSD in the urban primary care setting, and particularly among certainhigh-risk conditions, compels a critical examination of optimal approaches for screening, intervention, and referral to PTSD treatment.

Posttraumatic stress disorder is characterized by disabling symptoms of reexperien-cing, avoidance, and numbing after a significant traumatic event. 8The World Health Organization and others have substantiated the major imp act of posttraumatic mental disturbance on social and health functioning.9,10 In primary care settings, the prevalence of PTSD depends upon the features of the population studied and the methods forparticipant recruitment and assessment. In a nationally represen-tative US sample, Kessler et al. 11found a lifetime PTSD prevalence of 6.8%; 61% of males and 51% of females reported trauma exposure.12Breslau et al.13reported 90% lifetime prevalence of trauma and 9% probability of developing PTSD after trauma in an urban sample in Detroit. Stein and colleagues14found a 2% prevalence of current PTSD in a middle-class, university-affiliatedprimary care practice in San Diego. In a representative sample of national health clinics in Israel, 9% of patients had current PTSD. 15One-third of African-American primary care patients in an urban setting met PTSD diagnostic criteria.16Prevalence at veterans affairs (VA) health facilities ranges from 11.5% (current) to 27% (lifetime) PTSD.17,18Female gender, being divorced or widowed, other psychiatric or substance-use disorders, andexposure to certain traumas increase PTSD risk. 12,13,19Portions of this work were presented at the annual meeting of the Society of General Internal Medicine, May 2005, New Orleans, LA, at the annual meeting of the College on Problems of Drug Dependence, June2005, Orlando, FL, and at the annual meeting of the American PublicHealth Association, November 2004, Washington, DC. Received November 21, 2006 Revised February 1, 2007Accepted February 7, 2007Published online March 10, 2007 719However, these studies may not accurately estimate PTSD prevalence because of selective recruitment, nondiagnostic assessments, and low study participation.14,16,19-21Only one of these studies was conducted in a primary care practice in an urban, impoverished, and under represented minority popu- lation, a group at risk for PTSD because of high traumaexposure and low levels of social support. 22PTSD is clinically under-recognized; of patients with PTSD, primary care provi- ders recognized 2% in Israel and 47% in a VA setting.15,17 These findings are consistent with extensive literature on clinician under-recognition of other mental disorders.23 Accurate determination of PTSD prevalence in primary care settings serving patients at high risk is important for severalreasons. First, PTSD is associated with increased health-care utilization. 4,24-26Second, PTSD and trauma exposure have been associated with conditions commonly treated by primary careclinicians: somatization functional impairment, depression, anx- iety, chronic pain, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and substance- use disorders. 15,18,20,27-42Apart from depression,16these associations have not been evaluated in primary care. Addi- tionally, immigrant and refugee populations have high exposure to violence and merit further evaluation.43If PTSD is sufficiently prevalent in urban primary care patients or in those with certaincommon conditions, then it fulfills a key criterion for a clinical screening recommendation. 44Determining if primary care patients with specific comorbid conditions have particularly highprevalence of current PTSD strengthens the case and may even suggest an approach for targeted screening in primary care. We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate the preva- lence of and risk factors for PTSD in primary care patients at an urban hospital-based outpatient department. We assessed the prevalence of PTSD among those with immigrant status,depression, generalized anxiety or panic disorder, chronic pain,IBS, heavy drinking, and substance dependence (SD), and we determined also whether PTSD was identified by physicians caring for these patients. We hypothesized that PTSD preva-lence would be high, especially in patients with selected characteristics, and under-recognized by clinicians. We also hypothesized that clinicians might identify PTSD as depression,a more familiar mental illness. METHODS Study Design We interviewed a consecutive sample of primary care patients at the outpatient department of an urban university-affiliated hospital to examine overall prevalence of PTSD and its prevalence among patients with seven selected conditions:being an immigrant to the United States, major or other depression, generalized anxiety or panic disorder, heavy drinking, SD, IBS, and chronic pain. We also reviewed medicalrecords for documentation of PTSD and depression. Participants Patients visiting the Internal Medicine and Family Medicine clinics were eligible if they spoke English, were 18 -65 years old, and had a scheduled appointment with a primary careclinician. Patients were excluded if they could not be inter- viewed alone or did not appear to understand study proce- dures. After a planned minimum study enrollment of 100participants per selected condition was met for depression, anxiety, pain, and immigrant status with the first 509 enrolled participants ( \"consecutive sample \"), enrollment was limited to eligible patients with heavy drinking, drug use or IBS, or none of the selected conditions (control group) to permit planned subgroup analyses ( \"oversampled group \",n=98). Enrollment occurred from February 2003 to September 2004. Recruitment and Enrollment Interviewers approached consecutive patients upon arrival forappointments and screened t hem for eligibility. Eligible patients were asked to participate in an interview about stress and health. Each participant gave written informed consent. Study participants were compensated with $10, and theyreceived safety referrals upon interview completion. Interviews not completed before clinician visit were completed immedi- ately afterward. Boston University Medical Center 's Institu- tional Review and HIPAA Privacy Review Boards approved the study. A Certificate of Confidentiality was obtained from the National Institutes of Health. Data Collection Screening. The self-administered screening tool contained 19 questions about the following: demographics, symptoms of depression and anxiety (2 questions from the PRIME-MDscreener), 45IBS (4 definition questions from the ROME II Integrative questionnaire),46quantity and frequency of alcohol use in the past 30 days,47use of heroin or cocaine in the past month, and chronic pain in the past 3 months.48 Interview. Interview included demographic questions, the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) version 2.1PTSD module, 8,49the Chronic Pain Definitional Questionnaire,48 the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)45modules measuring depression diagnoses (major and other depression in the past 2 weeks) and anxiety disorder (generalized anxiety and/or panicdisorder in the past 4 weeks), and the CIDI-Short Form (CIDI-SF) substance-use disorder modules. 49The interview lasted for approximately 30 min. Medical Record Review. Using standardized data-collection forms, researchers trained in chart abstraction reviewed patient electronic medical records (EMRs), including all outpatient and emergency department records and inpatientdischarge summaries for the 12 months before and including the date of interview, to identify documentation of ICD-9 coded PTSD or depression in the problem list or in the visitassessment. All clinical encounters used EMR documentation. Dependent Variables: Trauma Exposure, PTSD, Medical Record Documentation. Current (past 12 months) and lifetime PTSD were diagnosed using CIDI version 2.1. 49The CIDI includes 9 questions about specific traumatic events and 2 open-ended questions. The research team classified open-ended responses as traumatic or nontraumatic according to DSM-IV guidelinesfor qualifying trauma. 8We defined trauma exposure as self- reported experience of any category of qualifying trauma. Multiple experiences of a single category of trauma (e.g., rape720 Liebschutz et al.: PTSD in Urban Primary Care JGIMor physical assault) were counted as one trauma exposure. Clinician recognition of PTSD and depression was defined as documentation of this diagnosis (PTSD or depression,respectively) in the active problem list or in the free text of a note in the medical record. Independent Variables and Covariates. Independent variables included immigrant status, IBS, chronic pain, anxiety, depression, heavy drinking, and SD. Immigrants were participants born outside the US or Puerto Rico. Irritable bowel syndrome was present if participants endorsed diagnostic criteria from the Rome II Integrative Questionnaire. 46Chronic pain was present if participants endorsed pain for 3 months or more on theChronic Pain Definitional Questionnaire. 48Current anxiety disorder was present if participants met diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety and/or panic disorder in the past monthaccording to the PHQ. 45Current depressive disorder was classified into major or other depression in the past 2 weeks according to the PHQ.45Heavy drinking in the past month was defined using the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse andAlcoholism guidelines. 47Substance dependence included alcohol dependence and/or drug dependence in the past 6 months as determined by the CIDI-SF.50Covariates were age, gender, income, employment, marital status, and race. Analyses We used descriptive analyses to determine the prevalence ofcurrent and lifetime PTSD and trauma exposure. Bivariateanalyses compared the prevalence of PTSD and trauma exposure in people with and without 7 selected conditions. We employed multivariable logistic regression to adjust forcovariates. Adjusted proportions were calculated using the mean values of background covariates; Pvalues comparing adjusted proportions are based on the regression coefficientsfor the group variable. Bivariate analyses compared PTSD or depression EMR documentation with research interview diag- noses. We used the consecutive sample ( N=509) for most analyses. Analyses examining heavy drinking, SD, and IBS utilized the enhanced sample (the consecutive sample plus the oversampled group, n=98) of 607 participants. RESULTS Participant Demographic and Clinical Characteristics Of 627 eligible patients, 509 (81%) were enrolled in the consecutive sample (Fig. 1). See Table 1for the demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample. Gender differences were notable for race, immigrant status, income, other depres- sion, anxiety, and SD. Compared to US-born people, immi-grants were more likely to be employed (63 vs 47%) and to bemarried or living with a partner (37 vs 23%). PTSD and Trauma Prevalence Thirty-four percent (95% CI, 30 -38%) of the consecutive sample met the diagnostic criteria for lifetime PTSD and 23% (CI 19 - 26%) for current PTSD. Median duration of PTSD symptoms was 6 years (range 1 month -44 years). Twenty-six percent (CI 21-32%) of women and 19% (CI 14 -24%) of men met the criteriafor current PTSD ( p=.04). Trauma exposure was very common (79%), with 65% reporting exposure to more than one trauma category. See Appendix for details of trauma exposure. Current PTSD was more common in participants with in- comes <$20,000 (30 vs 14%, p<.0001), unemployed or disabled (30 vs 16%, p=.0001), or separated/divorced (31 vs 15% for married, p=.009; or 31 vs 22% for never married, p=.009). Comorbid Conditions PTSD was significantly more common among participants with at least one comorbid condition (depression, pain, IBS, anxiety,and/or SD) than among those with none of these conditions (27 vs 8%, p<.0001). Ninety-one percent of participants with current PTSD had at least one comorbid condition compared to71% of those without PTSD. Of note, 75% of the entire consecutive sample (including those with PTSD) met the diagnostic criteria for at least one comorbid condition. In thosewith a comorbid condition, 28% had PTSD, whereas in thosewithout a comorbid condition, 91% did not have PTSD. Relationship of Comorbid Conditions with PTSD Prevalence: Adjusted Analyses In the consecutive sample, current PTSD was less common among immigrants compared to nonimmigrants. Current PTSD was more common among participants with chronic pain,anxiety disorders, and both major and other depression. Adjusted analyses of lifetime PTSD prevalence in people with comorbid conditions echoed the current PTSD findings (Table 2). Adjusted analyses in the enhanced sample revealed that current, but not lifetime, PTSD was significantly more commonin participants with IBS. Current PTSD prevalence was not Figure 1 . Study enrollment of patients in primary care. Consecutive sample: patients approached consecutively after registering for appointment. Oversampled group: consecutive sample criteria plus positive screen for irritable bowel symptoms, heavy drinking in past month, use of drugs in past month, or none of 6 select conditions (see text for details).721 Liebschutz et al.: PTSD in Urban Primary Care JGIMsignificantly higher among heavy drinkers or those with SD, whereas lifetime PTSD was (Table 3). Clinician Recognition: Medical Record Documentation Based on EMRs of the participants in the consecutive sample, 11% of patients with CIDI-determined current PTSD had aPTSD diagnosis documented in the medical record. Of partici-pants with current PTSD, 51% had depression noted in the medical record. Depression was noted in the EMR of 55% of those with both PTSD and depression (major and other), 43%of those with PTSD alone, 32% of those with depression but not PTSD, and 18% of those with neither PTSD nor depression (p<.0001 for differences between groups). DISCUSSION Among the patients attending an urban hospital-based prima- ry care practice, PTSD is an exceptionally common diagno-sis. 51Almost one-quarter of patients met the criteria for current PTSD and one-third met the criteria for lifetime PTSD.Importantly, documentation of this diagnosis was exceedingly uncommon. Only 11% of those with current PTSD were correctly identified in the medical record. In patients withcertain conditions (chronic pain, IBS, depression, anxiety disorder, and SD), PTSD prevalence was two to three times as high; patients with these conditions accounted for over 90% ofall cases of PTSD. While over a quarter of those with a co- occurring condition had PTSD, not having a co-occurring condition made the diagnosis of PTSD very unlikely. Our findings are consistent with the published studies of people with PTSD reporting more physical symptoms. 52-58 Multiple factors may contribute to the association between PTSD and physical symptoms including organic illnesses,31,57,59-61 altered physiology,62-64and psychological mechanisms.30 In this study, lifetime PTSD was present in half of patients with current heavy drinking and SD. These findings are similarto those from substance-abuse treatment settings and primary care. 38,39,65Surprisingly, current SD and heavy drinking were strongly associated with lifetime PTSD but only weakly withcurrent PTSD. One explanation may be that substance use dampens PTSD symptoms, an assertion supported by reports of PTSD patient self-medication in other studies. 66-68Another explanation may be that patterns of substance use are initiatedin a period of current PTSD but persist beyond its resolution. The higher PTSD prevalence in those with a diagnosis of depression and anxiety was not unexpected based on theliterature detailing the psychiatric conditions comorbid with PTSD. 12,69While primary care clinicians have become relative- ly more comfortable with identifying and managing depressionin the past 10 years, more work remains to optimize screening and treatment for other psychiatric disorders. 70-73More than half of our participants with EMR documentation of depressionmet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, suggesting that cliniciansmay have labeled psychological distress as the more familiar diagnosis of depression. Unlike depression, for which medication alone can be effective, evidence-based care for PTSD includes psychotherapy with or without medication. 74Trauma-focused psychotherapies can result in significant improvement of symptoms in morethan half of patients. 75Thus, treatment by primary care clinicians may require new strategies beyond psychoactive medication prescription. In particular, the close relationshipbetween physical problems and PTSD suggests an avenue to develop new interventions, better coordinating the care of general medicine and mental-health clinicians. Such coordina-tion of care to address mental-health conditions in the primarycare setting has been encouraged by a recent Institute of Medicine report. 76Based on this study 's findings, clinicians should consider evaluating patients who present with morethan 3 months of physical pain or IBS for PTSD and referring those with PTSD for care. In addition, effective PTSD treatment may improve pain. Extensive literature suggests that treatingdepressive symptoms can improve pain and disability. 77-81 An unexpected finding was the lower PTSD prevalence among immigrants. The study eligibility requirement to speak Englishlikely selected acculturated immigrants, producing a \"healthy immigrant effect \". 82Immigrants in this study had more social support as well. Other studies suggest lower psychiatric morbid- ity among some immigrant groups, depending on home country,socioeconomic status and subsequent adjustment to their adopted land. 83Additionally, it is likely that immigrants with PTSD would have had substantial barriers to learning EnglishTable 1.

The prevalence of PTSD in these urban primary care patients was markedly higher than that found in most other studies of primary care settings, including those involving veterans, where PTSD prevalence is expected to be high.14,15,18,19,21,31,37,85 Possible explanations for this population 's high PTSD prevalence are rooted in its socioeconomic profile with high exposure to trauma and low levels of social support. In a recent study of highschool students in Boston, 71% witnessed violence and 44% were directly victimized in the prior year. 86Social support is an important source of protection from the development of PTSDafter trauma exposure, 87-90and several demographic character- istics can serve as proxies for social support in this study. For example, half of our participants earned less than $20,000 per year. Likewise, half of the participants, all of whom were ofworking age, were unemployed or disabled. In addition, only 27% were married or living with a partner. 91,92 There were limitations to this study. As a diagnostic instru- ment, the CIDI PTSD module only assessed for symptoms after one trauma selected as most stressful by the participant,whereas other diagnostic interviews assessed for symptoms after multiple traumas, offering more opportunities for PTSD diagnosis. However, the instrument used in this study is the same or very similar to those instruments used in nationalPTSD studies. 12,13Our sample was drawn from a single hospital care system whose mission is to serve vulnerable populations and may not represent settings with a broader range of patients.However, our sample is similar to other urban medical settings serving low-income populations in demographic characteristics as well as prevalence of: depression, traumaexposure, substance-use disorders, and co-occurring chronic conditions. 16,93-97Further research in primary care settings serving other populations is warranted. Lastly, the prevalencewould only apply to patients aged 18 -65 years old presenting for care, not to a population of all primary care patients. Despite these limitations, the study had numerous strengths. We enrolled a large primary care sample of patients, oversampledfor less prevalent comorbid conditions of interest, utilized a well- regarded structured diagnostic interview for PTSD, and analyzed data with multivariable approaches. These methodological fea-tures address some of the concerns with prior studies of PTSD prevalence in primary care.Table 2.

Before recommending broadscreening for PTSD, screening tools and interventions in the primary care setting need to be developed and tested. In the meantime, it is appropriate for primary care clinicians treatingpatients in high-risk areas, particularly those with the condi-tions identified in this study, to assess for PTSD and refer those identified to effective care.

Methods: We conducted a genome wide associ ation study (Affymetrix SNP Gene Chip) for longevity-related traits in a community-based sample. We report on 5 longevity and aging traits in up to 1345 Framingham Study participants from 330 families. Multivariable-adjusted residuals were co mputed using appropriate models (Cox proportional hazards, logistic, or linear regression) and the re siduals from these models were used to test for association with qualifying SNPs (70, 987 autosomal SNPs with genotypic call family-based association test (FBAT) models, 8 SNPs in two regions approximately 500 kb apart on chromosome 1 (physical positions 73,0 91,610 and 73, 527,652) were associated with age at death (p-value < 10-5). The two sets of SNPs were in high linkage disequilibrium (minimum r2 = 0.58). The top 30 SNPs for generalize d estimating equation (GEE) tests of associatio n with age at death included rs10507486 (p = 0.0001) and rs4943794 (p = 0.0002), SNPs intronic to FOXO1A , a gene implicated in lifespan extension in animal models. FBAT models identified 7 SNPs and GEE models identified 9 SNPs associated with both age at death and morbidity-free survival at age 65 including rs2374983 near PON1 . In the analysis of selected candid ate genes, SNP associations (FBAT or GEE p-value < 0.01) were identified for age at death in or ne ar the following SNP associations in the GEE mode l for age at natural menopause in cluded rs6910534 (p = 0.00003) near FOXO3a and rs3751591 (p 0.00006) in CYP19A1 .

These data generate hypotheses and serve as a resour ce for replication as more genes and biologic pathways are proposed as contributing to long evity and healthy aging. Background Genetic factors associated with human longevity and healthy aging remain largely unknown. Heritability esti-mates of longevity derived from twin registries and large population-based samples suggest a significant but mod- est genetic contribution to the human lifespan (heritabil-ity ~15 to 30%) [1-4]. However, genetic influences onlifespan may be greater once an individual achieves age 60years [5]. Moreover, the reported magnitude of the geneticcontribution to other important aspects of aging such as healthy physical aging (wellness)[6], physical perform- ance [7,8], cognitive function [9], and bone aging [10] aremuch larger. Both exceptional longevity and a healthyaging phenotype have been linked to the same region onchromosome 4 [11,12], suggesting that although longev-ity per se and healthy aging are different phenotypes, theymay share some common genetic pathways. A number of potential candidate genes in a variety of bio- logical pathways have been associated with longevity inmodel organisms. Genes involved in the regulation ofDNA repair and genes in the evolutionarily conservedinsulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway [13,14] are emerging as holding great promise in the future elucidation of the underlying physiology control-ling lifespan. Many of these genes have human homologsand thus have potential to provide insights into humanlongevity [15-20]. Although numerous candidate geneshave been proposed, studies in humans are limited and initial findings often fail replication [21,22]. More recently genome-wide association studies (GWAS) havebecome feasible and offer a more comprehensive anduntargeted approach to detect genes with modest pheno-typic effects that underlie common complex conditions[23]. We had the opportunity to use the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Affymetrix 100K FHS offers the unique advantage of a longitudinalfamily-based community sample with participants whohave been well-characterized throughout adulthood with respect to prospectively ascertained risk factors and dis- eases and continuously followed until death. We reportseveral strategies for 100K SNP more than one related phenotype; and3) SNP associations within candidate genes and regionspreviously reported to be associated with longevity in model organisms or humans. Methods Study sample The genotyped study sample is comprised of 1345 Origi-nal cohort (n = 258) and Offspring (n = 1087) partici-pants who are members of the 330 largest FHS families.The Overview [24] provides further details of this sample.With respect to aging and longevity traits, 149 deaths occurred at a mean age at death of 83 years (range 46 to 99 years) and 713 participants achieved age 65 years orgreater. The Boston University Medical Center Institu-tional Review Board approved the examination content ofOriginal Cohort and Offspring examinations. All partici-pants provided written informed consent at every exami-nation including consent for genetic studies. Longevity and aging phenotyp e definitions and residual creationAge at death Both the Original Cohort and the Offspring Cohort remain under continuous surveillance and all deaths that occurred prior to January 1, 2005 were included in this study. Deaths were identified using multiple strategiesincluding routine participant contact for research exami-nations or health history updates, surveillance at the localhospital, search of obituaries in the local newspaper, andif needed through use of the National Death Index. Death certificates were routinely obtained and all hospital and nursing home records prior to death and autopsy reports(if performed) were requested. In addition, if there wasinsufficient information to determine a cause of death,the next of kin were interviewed by a senior investigator.All records pertinent to the death were reviewed by anendpoint panel comprised of three senior investigators. The date and cause of death (classified as due to coronary heart disease, stroke, other cardiovascular disease [CVD],cancer, other causes, or unknown cause) was recorded. Cox proportional hazards models were used to generate martingale residuals using the PHREG procedure in SAS to perform the regression analysis of survival time from age at study entry to age at death. Models were sex-specificand adjusted for 1) birth cohort and 2) birth cohort, edu-cation, current smoking status (yes/no), obesity (bodymass index 30 kg/m 2), hypertension (blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or on antihypertensive treatment), ele- vated cholesterol Genetics 2007, 8(Suppl 1):S13 http://www.biomed central.com/1471-2350/8/S1/S13 Page 3 of 12 (page number not for citation purposes)(fasting blood sugar 126 mg/dL, random blood sugar of 200 mg/dL, or use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents) and comorbidity defined as CVD and cancer. Birthcohort was defined as a categorical variable for all regres-sion models with the following categories based on yearof birth: birth year prior to 1900, 1900 to 1909, 1910 to1919, 1920 to 1929, 1930 to 1939, 1940 to 1949, and 1950 and later. All covariates were measured at study entry. Residuals from Original Cohort and Offspring par-ticipants were pooled. Morbidity-free surviv al at age 65 years Morbidity-free survival was defined as achieving age 65 years free of CVD, dementia, and cancer. CVD events included angina pectoris, coronary insufficiency, myocar-dial infarction, heart failure, stroke, transient ischemicattack (TIA), intermittent claudication and coronary orCVD death. Suspected CVD events were reviewed by apanel of three investigators who adjudicated events usingpreviously established criteria in place since study incep- tion [25]. A separate panel of study neurologists deter- mined the presence of stroke or TIA and a team of at leastone neurologist and one neuropsychologist determinedthe presence of dementia. Two independent reviewersexamined records for all cancers, and the vast majority ofcancer cases were microscopically confirmed with pathol- ogy reports. Logistic regression models were used to generate deviance residuals. Models were sex-specific and adjusted for 1)birth cohort and 2) birth cohort, education, current smok-ing status, obesity, hypertension, elevated cholesterol, and diabetes. Covariates were defined as above for age at death. All covariates were measured at the examinationclosest to the participant attaining age 65 years using a 5year window around age 65 years. Residuals from Origi-nal Cohort and Offspring participants were pooled. Age at natural menopause Natural menopause occurred after a woman had ceasedmenstruating naturally for one year and the age at naturalmenopause was the self-reported age at last menstruation.Mean age at natural menopause was similar in OriginalCohort and Offspring women and the distribution of nat-urally menopausal ages in women in the 330 FHS families was similar to that of women in all 1643 FHS families [26,27]. The mean age at natural menopause in women inthe 100K sample was 50.2 years (range 38 to 57 years) inOriginal Cohort women and 49.1 years (range 29 to 60years) in Offspring women. Crude age at natural menopause and standardized residu- als from multiple linear regressions in SAS [28] thatadjusted age at natural menopause for covariates of inter-est were used as traits for analysis. Covariates wereobtained at all attended examinations prior to the onset of menopause and included mean number of cigarettes smoked per day, mean body mass index, parity (0 versus1 or more live births), and generation (Original Cohort vs.Offspring). Walking speed Walking speed was measured on Original Cohort partici-pants at examination 27 (January 2002 through Decem-ber 2003, mean age of Original Cohort at exam 27: 86.7years) and Offspring participants attending an ancillarystudy to examination 7 (1999 to 2004, mean age at exam:62.0 years). Trained technicians timed participants walk- ing at their normal pace on a four meter course twice and subsequently asked participants to repeat the course walk-ing at a rapid pace. The mean timed fast walk among Off-spring participants in the 100K genotyping sample was2.44 seconds (standard deviation 0.89). The timed fastwalk was used for analysis. Sex-specific linear regressionwas used to generate residuals adjusted for age and height measured at the time of the walk. Biologic age by osseog raphic scoring system An osseographic scoring system (OSS) was applied to hand radiographs obtained on original cohort (1967 to1969, mean age 58.7 years) and offspring participants (1992 to 1993, mean age 51.6 years) [10]. Biologic age was then defined as the standardized residual between theOSS predicted age and the actual age. Biologic age definedby this system predicted mortality [10,29], was very herit-able (h linearregression of age on log-OSS adjusted for height, bodymass index, menopause, and MammalianGenotyping Service http://research.marshfieldclinic.org/ genetics are described in the Overview paper [24]. Statistical analysis The statistical methods for genome-wide linkage andassociation analyses are described in the Overview [24]. Association All residual traits described above as well as the additionaltraits listed in Table 1 were computed using Cox propor- tional hazards with martingale residuals for survival traits, logistic regression with deviance residuals for dichoto-mous traits, and linear regression with standard residualsfor quantitative traits.

The resid- uals were used to test for association between the geno- typed subset of individuals and the SNPs using additivefamily-based association test (FBAT) and generalized esti-mating equations (GEE) models as described in the Over-view [24]. total of 70,987 autosomal quency 10%, Hardy-Weinberg test p 0.001, and 10 families for FBAT. The number of tests withan FBAT p < 0.001, p < 0.0001, and p < 0.00001 for allphenotypes was similar to what would be expected underthe assumptions that the 70,987 tested SNPs were inde-pendent and there were no true associations. The GEE tests tended to give an excess of very small p-values over what would be expected under these assumptions. SNP prioritization We used several strategies to prioritize SNPs associatedwith longevity and aging traits. First, we used an untar-geted approach whereby the top 50 SNP associations ranked according to the strength of the p-value for each trait were examined. Next, we explored the consistency ofSNP associations across related sets of traits chosen a pri-ori (trait set one: age at death and morbidity-free survivalat age 65 years; trait set two: biologic age and walkingspeed). Trait set one was chosen based upon linkage data in humans demonstrating that both longevity and a healthy aging trait were linked to the same region on chro-mosome 4 raising the hypothesis that the two phenotypesmay share common genetic pathways [11,12]. The traitsin set two reflect aging with good physical functioningand thus we postulated that biologic age and walking speed may have genetic variants in common. We also investigated SNP associations in candidate genes andregions reported to be associated with longevity identifiedfrom established databases including NCBI [14] using thesearch term \"longevity\" Knowl-edge Environment genes/intervention database http:// sageke.sciencemag.org/cgi/genesdb [30] choosing genes potentially related to lifespan in humans. The SNPs were annotated using the UCSC genome browser tables using the May 2004 assembly http:// genome.ucsc.edu/ [31,32]. All genes within 60 kb of the top ranked SNPs were identified. Results The longevity and aging traits available in the FHS 100KSNP resource are listed in Table 1. In this report, we con-sider only five of the traits listed in Table 1: multivariable-adjusted age at death, morbidity-free survival at age 65 years, age at natural menopause, walking speed, and bio- logic age by OSS. These traits include a pooled sample ofOriginal Cohort and Offspring participants, with theexception of walking speed, which is reported in Off-spring participants only. Details of the sample size and covariate adjustment for each trait are provided in Table 1. For each of the five phenotypes, Table 2a and 2b provides the top five SNPs ranked in order by lowest p-value for theGEE and FBAT models (all associations can be viewed onthe web http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi- bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007 ). If multiple SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD r2 > 0.80) were included in the top 5, additional SNPs were included until a set of 5 independ-ent associations were listed. Eight SNPs on chromosome1 were associated with age at death in the FBAT analysis;all with p-value < 10 -4 and two with p-value < 10-5. The 8 SNPs kb apart. There was exception-ally high LD across this 500 kb region: the minimum r 2 between pairs of the eight SNPs was 0.58. The nearestgenes in this region existing in public databases were >500 kb from any of these SNPs [31,32]. There were several additional associations not listed in Table 2a and 2b that were of interest. For age at death inthe GEE analysis, SNP associations ranked numbers age at natural menopause, top ranked SNP associations inthe GEE model included number 11, rs6910534 (p near (p 0.00006) in CYP19A1 . Table 2c presents the LOD scores 2.0 and the corre- sponding 1.5-LOD support interval from genome-widelinkage for the three quantitative aging traits. None of theregions overlapped with SNPs associated with these agingtraits in the FBAT and GEE analyses. Of note for biologicage by OSS the linkage peak on chromosome 21 con- firmed a prior Framingham Study report using a genome- wide scan with 401 microsatellite markers [10]. Table 3 provides all SNP associations with a GEE or FBAT p < 0.01 for both traits within the two pairs of relatedtraits. For age at death and morbidity-free survival at age65 years, FBAT models identified 7 SNPs and GEE models identified 9 SNPs associated with both traits including rs2374983 near PON1 (Tables 3a and 3b). For biologic age by OSS and walking speed, 13 SNPs in FBAT modelsand 6 SNPs in GEE models were associated with bothtraits (Tables 3c and 3d). We identified from the literature 79 potential candidate genes and regions associated with longevity (see Addi-tional file 1 for listing). Of these, 12 genes had no SNPsand 67 genes had 1 to 45 SNPs within 60 kb of the geneBMC Medical Genetics 2007, 8(Suppl 1):S13 http://www.biomed central.com/1471-2350/8/S1/S13 Page 5 of 12 purposes)on the 100K Affymetrix GeneChip. There were 2036 SNPs in the LGV1 region on chromosome 4 previously linkedto exceptional longevity [11].

This resource has the potential todetect novel susceptibility genes for human longevity and aging and to examine the relevance of promising candi- date gene associations reported in animal models tohuman aging. We describe several strategies to prioritizeSNP associations in this unique resource to enhance thediscovery of various genes and pathways that contributeto the control of human longevity. Furthermore, FHSinvestigators are part of the NIA sponsored Longevity Consortium http://www.longevityconsortium.org which offers the opportunity of collaboration with other investi-gators to replicate important findings in additionalcohorts. In our untargeted approach of ranking SNP associations by the strength of the p-value, 2 intronic FOXO1a SNPs were associated with age at death. One of these SNPs(rs4943794) also was associated with biologic age by OSSin our a priori evaluation of select candidate genes. FOXO(forkhead box group O) transcription factors are targets of insulin-like signaling and are involved in a diverse set ofphysiological functions including DNA repair and resist- ance to oxidative stress [33,34]. Further, FOXO plays a role in lifespan extension in C. elegans and Drosophila [35]. Studies of this gene in humans are limited; two case-con-trol studies have not identified an association betweenFOXO1a and longevity [36,37]. However, the prospective population-based Leiden 85-plus Study found thatFOXO1a was associated with increased mortality attribut- able to diabetes related deaths in participants aged 85 years and older [38]. The Leiden 85-plus Study alsoreported that genetic variation causing a reduction ininsulin/IGF-1 signaling resulted in improved old age sur-vival among women [20]. However, that report examinedother genes in the insulin/insulin-like signaling pathway and did not specifically examine FOXO1a . Finally, the untargeted approach to SNP selection also identified aSNP near FOXO3a associated with age at natural meno- pause. This gene has been implicated in oocyte death,Table 4: All Significant SNP Associatio ns with Selected Longevity Candidate Genes* (FBAT or GEE p-value < 0.01) PositionFBAT p-value GEE p-value SNP function SNP position relative to gene (up to 60 kb) Age at death FOXO1a rs4943794 Unknown NCBI, SAGE ke, an d GenAge databases; 12 genes with no SNPs on 100K 2036 SNPs on 100K chip, results for this region available on the web The most strongly associated SNP near GAPDH is actually closer to MRPL51 The most strongly associated SNP ne ar WRN is actually closer to PURGBMC Medical Genetics 2007, 8(Suppl 1):S13 http://www.biomed central.com/1471-2350/8/S1/S13 Page 10 of 12 (page number not for citation purposes)depletion of functioning ovarian follicles, and infertility in mice [39,40] and thus represents a plausible candidate gene for menopause. Most positive common gene variant-disease association studies have failed replication [41]including reports on exceptional longevity. Haplotype-based fine mapping of the region on chromosome 4linked to human longevity initially suggested the MTP gene, a gene important in lipoprotein synthesis, was asso- ciated with longevity [21]. However, this associationfailed replication in a French cohort of long-lived individ-uals and subsequent case-control studies of nonagenari-ans [22,42]. Beekman, et al [43] found neither linkage to chromosome 4 nor association with the MTP gene and longevity among nonagenarians in the Leiden Longevity Study. Meta-analyses implicated admixture of the controlsample in the original report as an explanation for the pre-sumed false-positive association. Thus, our findings arehypothesis generating and their importance can not bedetermined without evidence of consistent replication inother populations. We examined pleiotropic effects by identifying SNP asso- ciations across two pairs of related traits. One SNP nearPON1 emerged as associated with both age at death and morbidity-free survival. Surprisingly, there were relativelyfew SNPs associated with both traits; prior work had sug- gested that longevity per se and healthy aging may share common genetic pathways [11,12]. However, morbidity-free survival was measured at age 65 years, it is possiblethat as our participants age morbidity-free survivaldefined at age 75 or 85 years will share additional SNPassociations with our longevity trait, age at death. A SNP near SOX5 , a gene potentially related to musculoskeletal function was associated with both biologic age by OSSand walking speed. Our strategy of selecting SNPs in candidate genes and regions previously reported to be associated with longev- ity yielded interesting findings. For age at death, we iden- tified SNPs in or near , and WRN . Defects in the WRN gene are the cause of Werner Syndrome, an autosomal recessive disor-der characterized by premature aging. A longitudinalstudy of ageing Danish twins recently reported a possibleassociation between a successful aging trait and 3 SNPs in the WRN gene [44]. We were unable to determine if our SNP (rs2725369) was in LD with the SNPs in the priorreport because the SNPs were not included in HapMap.Mutations in the KL (Klotho) gene in the mouse lead to a syndrome resembling human aging [45-47]. There hasbeen one report linking a functional variant of the KL gene to human longevity [15]. Thus, results from this GWAS may direct resources to the most relevant candidate genesand pathways for further investigation in humans.Several important limitations merit comment. First, we acknowledge that there may be a survival bias as partici- pants in this sample had to survive to provide DNA (firstsystematic DNA collection began 1995) and hence arelikely healthier than the full FHS sample. To amelioratethis issue, we adjusted for covariates using the full Fram-ingham sample, and used the residual traits for the subset of individuals genotyped using the 100K Affymetrix Gene- Chip to test for association with the SNPs using linearregression models. Residual traits from Cox and logisticmodels typically are not ideally distributed for linearregression models, but our adjustment method using thefull sample precludes the testing of SNP associations with age at death and morbidity-free survival using Cox and logistic models. Second, the 100K Affymetrix GeneChipprovides limited coverage of the genome; many of our apriori candidate genes did not have any SNP coverage onthe chip. For example, several genes that have been stud-ied in model organisms or even in humans such as ACE, Lamin A, SIRT2 and SIRT3 , had no SNPs within 60 kb of the gene on the 100K Affymetrix GeneChip. However, genotyping is near-complete for the NHLBI funded 550 Kgenome-wide scan on all FHS participants. This will ena-ble deeper exploration of our initial 100K SNP associa-tions in a larger sample with denser coverage of thegenome. Third, in this analysis we did not examine epista- sis or gene-environment interactions which may modify the associations in this study. Importantly, this study ishypothesis generating. Our findings need to be replicatedin other samples. Conclusion In summary, the untargeted genome-wide approach todetect genetic associations with longevity and aging traitsprovides an opportunity to identify novel biologic path-ways related to lifespan control. GWAS also have thepotential to direct investigators of human aging to themost promising candidate gene associations and biologic pathways reported to regulate lifespan in animal models. Enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms respon-sible for aging may in turn identify directions for healthpromotion and disease prevention efforts in middle-agedand older adults so that older persons can enjoy moretime in good health. These data generate hypothesesregarding novel biologic pathways contributing to longev- ity and healthy aging and serve as a resource for replica- tion of findings from other population-based Medical Genetics 2007, 1):S13 http://www.biomed central.com/1471-2350/8/S1/S13 Page 11 of 12 (page number not for citation purposes)SNP = single nucleotide polymorphism; TIA = transient ischemic attack.

Methods: We conducted 10 focus groups including 71 physicians involved in technology implementation efforts across the USbetween April 2002 and February 2005. Results: Two major themes emerged across focus groups around reliance on CIT to reduce errors: (1) can it work? and (2) at what cost to the medical profession? Within the first theme, physicians expressed concern about the appropriateness of physician-directed CIT as a solution for medical errors, concerns regarding the current technical capabilities and level of technical support for CITsolutions, and concern about the introduction of new errors. Within the second theme, physicians were particularly concerned about time efficiency and workload redistribution associated with the introduction of ClT.Across focus groups, physicians tended to generalize about the role of all IT in their lives, potentially biasing opinions about specific technologies. Conclusions: Health care organizations attempting to promote physician use of CIT are advised to deepen consideration of physicians' perspectives about technology adoption and use in order to address their concerns, reduce skepticism, and increase the likelihood of implementation success. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction such errors is undeniably attractive. In particular, recom\u00ad mendations from the industry-based Leapfrog Group sparked Given daunting estimates about the prevalence of medical tremendous interest in the application of CPOE systems errors in clinical medicine [1], the potential for CIT to prevent [2-5]. which have proved effective in reducing prescribing Corresponding author at: Division of Health Services Management and Policy, School of Public Health, The Ohio State University, 1841 Millikin Road, Cunz Hall 476, front matter \u00a9 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

New physician-directed CIT, including CPOE, computerized order sets, and even handheld computers (HHCs), can help improve legibility and provide information to help with clinical decision making at the point of care [6,8-10]. For example, the CPOE process permits physicians to enter medical orders directly into a computer [11,12], providing the opportunity for monitoring medications, improving legibility, and checking for drug-drug interactions, among other functions. Such CPOE systems also introduce the potential to practice evidence-based care by providing aggregated order sets or embedded clinical guidelines [13], thereby reducing the likelihood of errors of omission. The use of HHCs in medicine offers potential to reduce medical errors by enabling physicians to check for drug-drug interactions and providing access to clinical data that can help physicians make medical decisions [9,10]. Yet while the potential for CIT to reduce the prevalence of medical errors appears great, the proliferation of such tech\u00ad nologies in clinical practice is not particularly fast [14,15], nor without controversy [16-20]. All of these technologies chal\u00ad lenge healthcare organizations on several fronts, including security, confidentiality, compatibility, capital, and coordina\u00ad tion issues [9,16,17,21-26]. Several recent studies have high\u00ad lighted new sources of errors associated with the introduc\u00ad tion of CPOE [16,18-20), while the introduction of HHCs has raised concerns about information security, data accuracy, and physician dependency on the technologies themselves [9,10]. Most of these issues appear resolvable, and the benefits of physician-directed CIT innovations in reducing costs and errors are likely to accrue if these technologies can be suc\u00ad cessfully introduced and integrated into clinical practice, e.g. [29,30]. Yet within most stories about CIT implementation lurk lists of potential barriers, risks, and challenges associated with getting physicians to adopt and use the new technolo\u00ad gies, e.g. [9,12,21,25-29,31]. We were interested in exploring these issues, and particularly the largely unnamed problem of physician skepticism, from the perspectives of physicians themselves. Focusing on three information technologies in particular, CPOE systems, order sets within CPOE systems, and HHCs,we asked both user and non-user physicians about their expectations for these technologies. While user perspec\u00ad tives may vary considerably across different technologies, we were interested in open discussion about CIT-related issues to uncover any consistent themes or issues. Our investigation was enabled by a multiple focus group methodology. 2. Methods 2.1. Study design We used focus groups [32J to collect physician opinions about the use of physician-directed CIT across a range of CIT interventions. A multidisciplinary team of investigators gath\u00ad ered data from ten focus groups held between April 2002 and February 2005. These included focus groups discussing CPOE, computerized order sets, and HHCs. Consistent with the techniques of rigorous qualitative research [33,34], semi\u00ad structured focus group guides with open-ended questions were used to facilitate discussion of topics among partici\u00adpants. Our exploratory study was framed by our research ques\u00ad tion, \"What do physicians think about the potential for clinical information technologies including CPOE systems, computer\u00ad ized order sets, and HHCs to reduce medical errors?\" Focus group questions were designed to explore the issues of how, why, and when physicians did or would use CPOE, HHCs, or computerized order sets within a CPOE system. 2.2. Focus group process Physicians were recruited by electronic mail messages invit\u00ad ing them to participate in our study, and were offered a token incentive of a gift certificate ($50 or $25) in appre\u00ad ciation for their willingness to participate. Sessions lasted 60-90min and were conducted over a meal. 'TYpically, focus group sessions were moderated by one study investigator with a co-moderator available to assist. Each session was audio\u00ad taped and transcribed verbatim to facilitate data analysis. We received ethical approval from the appropriate Institutional Review Boards of The Ohio State University and Columbus Children's Hospital. 2.3. Population studied Combined, focus groups included 71 physicians purposely sampled so that informants represented both users and non\u00ad users of the different information technologies, across diverse clinical specialties and practice settings. Focus groups were conducted across the US in academic medical centers (2), community hospital systems (3), a children's hospital (2), an independent practice association (1), and at a regional meet\u00ad ing of physicians (2),the Society for General Internal Medicine annual meeting in Chicago, IL. Across focus groups, 30% of participants were women, 20%were specialists, and 32%were clinicians in full-time practice (68%were residents or fellows affiliated with a teaching institution). 2.4. Analysis Nearly 250 pages of single-spaced transcripts were produced for analysis during the course of this research. Our analysis applied a combination of deductive and inductive methods (35), including a grounded theory approach [36,37]. During the study, we iteratively read transcripts and discussed find\u00ad ings, using the constant comparative method of analysis [34] to permit us to explore new ideas and themes that emerged in subsequent focus groups. We used common techniques to code data [35,38]'identifying broad themes and patterns that emerged from the data. Discussions among study investiga\u00ad tors led to consensus around the major themes and patterns that emerged across focus groups that we describe in this paper. We present the two major themes that emerged across all focus groups, along with representative patterns in the data that emerged in a majority of focus groups. We used the quali\u00ad tative data analysis software program Atlas.ti (Version 4.2) [39] to support our analysis process. 3. Results 'TWo major themes emerged around physicians' expectations about the studied information technologies and their poten\u00ad838 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS 76 (2007) 836-842 tial to impact medical errors: (1) skepticism regarding appro\u00ad priateness and capability of CIT to substantially reduce med\u00ad ical errors; and (2) concern about the impacts of CIT on their work and lives. Simply, these concerns can be summarized as \"Can it work?\" and, \"Atwhat cost to the medical profession?\" These two themes are each presented below, followed by our discussion and a conclusion to the article. 3.1. Theme 1: can it work? Across focus groups, a strong theme that emerged from the data was that physicians remain skeptical about the ability of physician-directed CIT to reduce medical errors. Three pat\u00ad terns emerged around this theme: (1)concerns regarding the appropriateness of physician-directed CIT as a solution for medical errors; (2) concerns regarding the current technical capabilities and level of technical support for CIT solutions; and, (3) concern about the introduction of new errors. 3.1.1. Appropriateness First, in most focus groups, several respondents noted that it appeared unclear that the CIT solutions implemented were appropriately matched to the problems of medical errors. As one physician explained, \"Frankly most docs have to be con\u00ad vinced that CPOE specifically addresses patient safety issues because there is still some decent data, atleast our data locally and some of the stuff I have read, that still seem to show that a heck of a lot of errors occur in the actual administra\u00ad tion of the medication.\" Another physician describing order sets within CPOE noted how, \"having never been on the other side of the order, it is still a real big mystery there that could lead to errors.\" Similarly, physician participants were, for the most part unconvinced that HHCs could have a measurable impact on medical errors, even though there was consensus that \"it should.\" Other physicians offered stories to illustrate their skepticism. As one explained, \"In 20 years as a clinician Ican count ... on fewer than five fingers the numbers oftimes that verbal orders have been taken down wrongly that caused anything even close to a significant ill effect on a patient. ... So you can say verbal orders have to be changed-that it is a patient safety issue. And from a doc's standpoint, what they are going to say is, 'Prove to me that verbal orders have caused bad patient outcomes.' 3.1.2. Technical capability A second pattern emerged around the technical capability of current CITimplementations to facilitate error reductions. Across focus groups, both hardware and software applications were soundly criticized for their limitations. Consequently, many physicians reported that they were waiting for proof that change is necessary, or that a new technology will actually help. As one commented, \"Myphilosophy towards technology has always been that the role of technology is to serve me and not the other way around.\" This shared sentiment was reflected across focus groups when respondents described resistance to, rather than wholehearted endorsement of, the different CITinnovations. Consensus among focus group par\u00ad ticipants showed that many existing technologies are not yet sufficiently useful, and that many physicians are not yet suffi\u00ad ciently comfortable with the IT to ensure any appreciable ben\u00adefit from ITuse. Further, with the exception of the perspectives of self-described \"technophiles\" or \"power users\"[10], many technology limitations proved insurmountable for physicians frustrated by their inability to do what they want to do with the technology both efficiently and effectively. Skepticism about technology capability was particularly apparent in two main areas: (1) system accessibility; and, (2) system design. First, the ability to access CIT systems quickly and easily was repeatedly noted as an issue. In the words of one physician, \"You have med students, fellows, occasional attending physicians, seniors, and interns that are doing things in the morning, and there's often not enough computers.\" Another summarized, \"if you try to do things at shift change, it's a nightmare.\" These limitations could cre\u00ad ate problems with work-arounds, as physicians searching for available computers make compromises. For example, one physician explained, \"And every once in a while if you have just one order that you need to put in you may ask someone else to just put in for you because they're already logged in. But, then again that's not ideal either because if they're not fol\u00ad lowing that patient and they get a call from pharmacy asking, 'do you really want that dosing?' it's hard to say, 'well, actu\u00ad ally, someone else wanted me to put in that order.\" Similarly, physicians typically reliant on HHCs to look up medications reported tending to \"guess\" or \"cross my fingers\" when they could not access information on the device rather than make the effort to find the appropriate reference manual. Limita\u00ad tions on battery life for laptops and HHCs and time required for complex sign-on processes were also noted as challenges in accessing existing systems, consistent with prior research [8,9,40-43). In addition, accessibility problems associated with system down time were a serious concern. Across groups, participants commented about the problems created when the CIT device or system failed. As one participant described a CPOE system failure, \"you have nurses who don't know how to do charting on paper when the system is down and they have to go back and talk to the older nurses or other people about how did you chart this information?\" Another explained how \"the system was turned off last night to update and it was updating this morning for 2Y2h and it was chaos.\" Similarly, multiple physi\u00ad cian respondents provided examples of how they \"panicked\" when their HHCcrashed or \"had to go home\" when they had forgotten the device, contributing to skepticism about reliance on CIT. A second issue regarding the technical capacity for CIT to reduce errors emerged around system design and included comments about both the content design and maintenance within CITsystems. With computerized order sets, physicians expressed concern that the evidence used in developing order sets and alerts could be out of date, incomplete, or incor\u00ad rect, and reported that this fear has led some clinicians to limit use of decision support, one of the key elements in medical error reduction. As one participant explained of the order sets, \"Some of them are really good and some are just very incomplete.\" With CPOE, one physician noted how, \"all of our medications are dependent on the weight. And there's nothing that warns you that the weight has not been done.\" Others expressed frustration with not really understanding the CPOE system itself, and reported learning about system 839 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS 76 (2007) 836-842 enhancements from peers and colleagues more frequently thanthroughany otheravenue.WithHHCs,severalphysicians reported that they did not always trust the information avail\u00ad able in ePocrates (the common drug reference database), and many made comments about the fact that \"things are always changing.\" 3.1.3. New errors Finally, in several focus groups, participants provided exam\u00ad ples of how the new technologies could actually lead to new types of errors. As one participant explained of a CPOE sys\u00ad tem, \"Sometimes there are defaults so that if you're entering an order quickly, you can put in a number like 6 but it will be bumped to 60 because of the way the order is written. So you actually have to type 06.\" Another example was pro\u00ad vided in explaining the use of the comments field in the CPOE system. As one physician explained, \"Those comments are often ignored ... if you put in a lab for 2 days from now and you write \"please draw 2 days from now:' it gets drawn that night.\" One physician particularly resistant to CPOE adoption predicted problems associated with \"the classic law of unin\u00ad tended consequences:' and explained how by eliminating the option of verbal orders, \"you are going to have a delay in care.\" Discussion of the sources and potential for new errors consis\u00ad tently mentioned both CPOE systems and order sets, with less discussion about observed errors using HHCs. Across groups, consensus appeared that these CIT innovations had undeni\u00ad able potential, but, as one participant summarized, \"I think it decreases the errors we know about and it increases the errors we don't know about.\" 3.2. Theme 2: at what cost to the medical profession? A second major theme emerged across focus groups around physicians' concerns about the impact of CIT on their lives as physicians, thus tempering their enthusiasm about CIT as a medical error reduction strategy. 'TWo patterns of concern involved time efficiency and workload distribution. First, many physicians in our focus groups were concerned about the fact that the adoption and use of new technolo\u00ad gies actually took more time than familiar manual processes. With order sets and CPOE systems, these changes were partic\u00ad ularly apparent. Specifically, when the order set or system was limited, this was frustrating to physicians. As one explained, \"if there are things significantly absent, it's not even quicker. There are just too many things to add.\" In contrast, several physicians noted that \"if it's a good order set, it significantly saves time.\" Especially in the early stages of technology intro\u00ad duction, physicians noted how the IT involved more time. As one explained, \"you still have a tendency to want to call downstairs\" to verify if a result is unavailable \"because you still don't believe.\" Participants also reported an association between problems with system access and efficiency gains. As one commented, \"The efficiency that we've gained with these computers just goes down the tubes when we can't find a computer to enter orders in.\" Perspectives about HHC use were particularly mixed, with many physicians reporting efficiency gains and others reporting none. Consensus across groups and technologies emerged as one physician summa\u00ad rized: \"I think it changes time. But I don't think it's faster in terms where we're getting to see more. I mean we're talking minutes.\" The availability of timely technical support was also noted as a threat to physicians' efficiency, and physicians' comments about the lack of immediate technical support were fairly com\u00ad mon. As one frustrated physician complained, \"Because you're putting that order set in and you're trying to admit the patient and you have three more to admit after that. And you have to wait for 10 minutes for them to call you back ... I know 10 min\u00ad utes is a short amount of time for an IS department, but for us, I mean we're already doing two things after that.\" Another participant explained how, \"to call someone and make the complaint and get it in just extends the amount of time it takes.\" This frustration thus potentially limits the ability of the organization itselfto respond to and correct problems that may remain unreported. Another pattern of concern about these technologies involved a shift in physicians' workloads. Across all three information technologies, physicians noted that their use of the technologies resulted in physicians becoming more responsible for actual data entry than had been the case in the past. Instead of relying on nurses, clerks, or other ancillary personnel to support their clinical practice, physicians using these new technologies found themselves doing direct data entry. As one physician explained, \"Where is the payback for us? We are trying to be cooperative. We are trying to be good soldiers, but where is the payback for us? That is kind of the theme it seems to me as to why a lot of CPOE and other ini\u00ad tiatives are frowned upon. I don't think it is because of the old cliche that docs are techno-phobic. I don't think that is the truth. How does it at least make my life time-neutral?\" How\u00ad ever, not all respondents were completely negative. Instead, several commented about how with CPOE systems, \"now you have the more medically trained individuals doing the orders instead of the unit clerk saying, well, I think it might be this and I think those might be this.\" Yet while electronic data entry processes clearly have the potential to improve both the legibility and the accuracy of data, the experienced shift in workload was not well-appreciated by the majority of our physician participants. 4. Discussion Across focus groups, many physicians remain skeptical about the ability of new information technologies to reduce medical errors and improve their lives. For each technology, a myr\u00ad iad of different factors can result in a personal non-adoption or abandonment decision, or can lead to collective resistance toward a technology, at worst. Among these physicians, their own prior experiences with technology, both good and bad, seemed to weigh disproportionately. Especially when judged on the basis of time savings or improvements in care and ser\u00ad vice to patients, many of our physician informants remained unconvinced about the potential of new CIT. Further, given the difficulties already associated with convincing physicians to adopt CIT, e.g. [9,11,12,44]' this remaining skepticism can cre\u00ad ate even greater challenges, potentially affecting the ability of organizations to both successfully implement new technolo\u00ad gies and to foster organizational culture change [20,45J around the issue of reducing medical errors. 840 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS 76 (2007) 836~-842 Unintended consequences of various information technol\u00ad ogy applications have been documented in the areas of both data entry and data retrieval, and these represent a source of new errors in medicine that become new problems to solve [18,19,46]. In our focus groups, physicians noted opportuni\u00ad ties for these new sources of errors, and expressed concern about the inherent trade-offs. Thus consistent with recent research [18,19,23,44-50], it remains critical to carefully study the results ofITimplementation, considering bothintentional and unintentional solutions and problems. Our finding about increased time requirements was con\u00ad sistent with other published research reporting that physi\u00ad cian usage of new information technologies requires changes in practice patterns and workflow, and may increase the time providers typically spend on documentation activities [12,24,50,51]. Further, despite increasing evidence that time savings might appear in the future due to these new technolo\u00ad gies, the reported skepticism among many of our physician respondents appeared to limit their willingness to experi\u00ad ment with the new technologies, instead causing them to stick to the basics required or what they actually know will work. Consequently, in practical CIT implementations where physicians are not mandated to use new technolo\u00ad gies, physician resistance to adoption and use may not be surprising. Perhaps more troubling is our perception that physicians tend to generalize about the role of electronic information in their lives. Instead of evaluating each CIT on its own merits, we found that physicians resistant to the new technologies were resistant to all new technologies-not only the individual CITbeing introduced. In practice, this \"lumping\" phenomenon could have positive or negative consequences, depending on their perspectives about the CIT. For instance, for physicians coming out of medical schools and residency programs where CIT innovations had been prevalent, resistance to adopting or using a new technology affected only the particular ver\u00ad sion of the order set, CPOE system, or HHC they were using. They fully expected CITto be partoftheirclinicalpractice, and focused complaints on the specifics of a technology. In con\u00ad trast, physicians who were more techno-phobic or who had negative experiences with past technology implementations tended to report more frustration, complain more, and appear less open to change, despite the apparent inevitability of CIT in clinical practice. Given physicians' apparent tendency to generalize across technologies, it may be advantageous for health care organi\u00ad zations planning CIT implementations to consider the inher\u00ad ent variability across target physician users. For instance, it may be possible to tailor implementation strategies, making a distinction between physicians with positive pre-conceptions and those with negative pre-conceptions. By segmenting tar\u00ad get users, information systems departments could work to have appropriate responses ready for the different user popu\u00ad lations, especially with respect to anticipated concerns about time requirements, CIT impact, and availability of support. A customized approach in practice could streamline the CIT implementation process for many users already \"convinced\" about the value of IT, but provide additional information and feedback to address the remaining skepticism among \"uncon\u00ad vinced\" physicians. On a more positive note, the healthy dose of skepticism remaining among current and potential users of new CITmay help drive both product and process improvements around CITthat can, in turn, improve the quality of care supported by the new technologies. Across focus groups, physicians' will\u00ad ingness to provide input about what technology features are most helpful and what capabilities they would like was strik\u00ad ing. Including interested physicians in technology-aided pro\u00ad cess improvements and in developing decision support tools such as order sets or HHCdatabases will likely continue to help increase physicians' usage and acceptance of such technolo\u00ad gies. Given that CIT implementation appears to proceed in a never-ending cycle of product enhancements, exploring and accommodating physicians' perspectives and interests could conceivably help both product developers and organizations involved in technology implementation in order to ensure that physicians' needs are best met and to maximize the opportu\u00ad nity to reduce physician skepticism. Finally, our data highlight the importance of consider\u00ad ing physicians' perspectives about CIT and its role in their lives. While brief user satisfaction surveys may satisfy ven\u00ad dors and health care organizations, our focus groups reveal additional concerns about the various technologies that our deeper exploration of CITadoption and use uncovered. Health care administrators, and information systems personnel in particular, would be advised to take into account these per\u00ad spectives when attempting to introduce and implement new or enhanced CIT within physicians' clinical practices. If not, our study suggests the potential for downstream problems with adoption and use that are currently reflected in physician skepticism about the role of CITin reducing medical errors. 4.1. Limitations Several important limitations of this research must be acknowledged. First, we realize that combining the study of different technologies across focus groups risks losing the nuances associated with findings about the individual tech\u00ad nologies. While we have attempted to report areas of con\u00ad sensus and dissent within and across focus groups, we are aware that these individual technologies are markedly dif\u00ad ferent, and generalizations about CIT as a category may be difficult to support. Second, it is possible that our purpose\u00ad ful sampling methodology has led to bias in our results. While consistent with the standards of rigorous qualitative research, this methodology limits our ability to generalize our find\u00ad ings, also admittedly a limitation of much qualitative research. Third, the design of focus groups introduces the possibility that respondents can influence each other in their discus\u00ad sion of a particular topic. The themes we discuss in this paper emerged from issues raised in the focus group discussions, but it is possible that the apparent salience of a particular issue was influenced by the discussion process itself. In addition, it is possible that some participants did not feel comfortable sharing their opinions given the non-confidential nature of the focus group discussions.

Conclusions Policymakers, organizations, and providers relying on the promise of CIT to solve problems and reduce medical errors must be aware of the limitations of such technologies, and remain cognizant of the many issues associated with adop\u00ad tion and implementation of such technologies. At this time in the evolution of various CIT, there is still a profound risk that exaggerated promises about the potential of new technologies may be misdirecting institutional focus toward fairly trivial tactics that only minimally address the non-trivial problem of medical errors. Further, if existing physician skepticism is not recognized and addressed, the true potential for CIT to reduce medical errors through widespread adoption and usage will remain limited.

BACKGROUND: Health services research has docu- mented the magnitude of health care variations. Few studies focus on provider level sources of variation inclinical decision making-for example, which primarycare providers are likely to follow clinical guidelines, with which types of patient. OBJECTIVES: To estimate: (1) the extent of primary care provider adherence to practice guidelines and the unconfounded influence of (2) patient attributes and (3) physician characteristics on adherence with clinicalpractice guidelines. DESIGN: In a factorial experiment, primary care provi- ders were shown clinically authentic video vignettes with actors portrayed different \"patients \"with identical signs of coronary heart disease (CHD). Different types of providers were asked how they would manage the different \"patients \"with identical CHD symptoms. Measures were taken to protect external validity. RESULTS: Adherence to some guidelines is high (over 50% of physicians would follow a third of the recom- mended actions), yet there is low adherence to many ofthem (less than 20% would follow another third). Female patients are less likely than males to receive 4 of 5 types of physical examination ( p<.03); older patients are less likely to be advised to stop smoking(p<.03). Race and SES of patients had no effect on provider adherence to guidelines. A physicians 'level of experience (age) appears to be important with certainpatients. CONCLUSIONS: Physician adherence with guidelines varies with different types of \"patient \"and with the length of clinical experience. With this evidence it ispossible to appropriately target interventions to reduce health care variations by improving physician adher- ence with clinical Society of General Internal Medicine 2007;22:289 -296 Social and behavioral scientists have begun to identify different nonmedical influences on provider clinical deci- sion making. For a range of common medical problems,clinical decision making appears to be influenced as much bywho the patient is (their age, race, or gender), which provider they encounter, and the type of organizational setting in which medical care is provided as it is by the signs and symptoms ofthe problem itself 1-3. Some studies show that only about half of those who utilize the health system actually receive the recommended processes of medical care4. Recently, attention has turned to the quality of medical decisions -that is, the extent to which specific providers adhere to appropriate medical practice guidelines (test ordering, prescribing behav-ior, life style recommendations, referrals, and patient follow- up) for common medical problems presented by specific types of patients 5.T h i sp a p e rf o c u s e so ns p e c i f i cs o u r c e so f variation in physician adherence to clinical guidelines: thatis, which primary care providers are likely to evidence appro- priate clinical practice, with which types of patients? Evidence on these specific sources of provider variation is required toensure that interventions to improve the quality of care and reduce health variations are appropriately targeted. First, we sought to identify the extent to which providers adhere toclinical guidelines in their clinical decision making; second, we examine the influence of patient and provider factors on clinical decisions making. Is variation associated with specificpatients? Is it associated with particular providers? METHODS The objective of this research was to estimate the unconfoundedinfluence (either singly or in combination) of: (a) patient attributes (age, gender, race, and socioeconomic status) and (b) provider characteristics (physician gender and years of clinical experience)on medical decision making when providers are presented \"patients \"who show identical signs and symptoms strongly suggestive of coronary heart disease (CHD) (a common medicalproblem). We conducted a factorial experiment that permitsestimation of unconfounded main effects and interactions of anyJGIM Received February 22, 2006 Revised June 19, 2006Accepted November 10, 2006Published online January 9, 2007 2892 of the variables listed above. The experiment focused on a range of clinical decisions as they relate to a case of CHD6,7. Research methods are summarized below (see also McKinlay et al 2006,8. A version of the videotaped CHD condition (varying by age, race, or gender) was shown to each of the physicians recruited as subjects for the experiment. We recruited a total of 128Massachusetts licensed, randomly sampled internists and family physicians. We stratified subjects according to gender and level of clinical experience, including eligible physiciansuntil each cell was complete. The \"patient \"(reluctantly made the appointment) presents with a complaint of \"indigestion \"and features of chronic atypical chest pain. For the estimation of main effects, a total sample of 128 physicians gives 80% powerto detect an absolute difference in means of 25%. For 2-way interactions, it provides 80% power to detect an effect size of .25. The effect size is a ratio of the variability of the hypothesizedmeans divided by the variability of the observations. For 2 means with a difference , standard deviation of subjects s, the effect size /2s 9. Immediately after viewing the selected video for the experiment, the experimental subjects completed a semistructured interview. This interview included questions concerning how they would manage the case of CHD depicted inthe video in their everyday clinical practice, including their mostlikely diagnoses, their certainty with respect to the diagnosis, test ordering, prescriptions, lifestyle recommendations, and what other information they might seek. Qualitative techniqueswere employed to elicit the reasons why decisions were made. Experimental Stimuli (Scenarios) Professional actors and actresses were recruited and trained(under experienced physician supervision) to realistically por-tray a \"patient \"presenting to a primary care provider with the signs and symptoms of CHD. Sixteen versions of the scenario were videotaped, systematically varying the \"patient 's\"age (55 vs. 75 years to get some separation between the middle agedand older patients), race (white vs. black), gender and socio- economic status (lower vs. higher social class \u2014a janitor vs. a teacher). Potentially relevant nonverbal indicators were em-bedded in the script, such as the \"Levine fist. \"Each videotaped encounter simulated an initial interview with either an inter- nist or family practitioner and was of 7 -8 minutes in duration, reflecting the average length of a consultation (face time) with a primary care physician (not including a physical exam 10). CHD was selected because: (a) it is among the most common and costly problems presented by older patients to primarycare providers 11; (b) it is a relatively well-defined organic medical condition; and (c) it can result in a range of possible diagnostic, therapeutic, and life style actions. A script for thecase of CHD was developed from tape-recorded role-playing sessions with experienced, clinically active advisors. \"Patients \" in the CHD vignette presented with symptoms suggestive,although not pathophenomic, of CHD (including, for example, heartburn, indigestion unrelieved with antacids, new subster- nal discomfort, which is exertional and resolves after severalminutes rest, pain in the back between the shoulder blades,stress, and elevated blood pressure). Experimental Subjects (Physicians) To be eligible for selection, an equal number of male and femalephysicians had to: (a) be internists or family practitioners; (b)have12 years clinical experience (graduated between 1989 and 1996) or 22 years experience (graduated between 1965 and 1979) to get clear separation by level of experience; (c) betrained at an accredited medical school in the US; and (d) be currently providing clinical care at least half time. Eligible physicians were randomly sampled from throughout Massa-chusetts to fill 4 design cells (gender by level of experience). Screening telephone calls were conducted to identify eligible subjects and an hour-long, in-person interview was scheduled(at which time informed consent was obtained). Each physi-cian subject was provided a modest stipend ($100) to partially offset lost revenue and to tangibly acknowledge participation. The response rate was 64.9%. Assessing the Quality of Medical Care Assessment of the quality of decision making requires some gold standard against which physician behavior can be compared. We originally planned to derive this standard from2main sources: (a) official clinical guidelines promulgated by, for example, AHRQ and AHA; and (b) the recommendations of a respected group of local clinical peers as to what anyminimally competent provider should do when encounteringthe videotaped \"patient. \"This approach was designed to accommodate the competing interests of different groups by developing a consensus view triangulated from these 2 sourceson the most appropriate management of the presenting \"patients \"on the videotape. Table 1depicts considerable divergence between the actions listed in the clinical guidelines Table 1.

Furthermore, there was little consensus among the clinical peers as a group about the recommended action for the clinicalcase. This divergence may partly explain the fact that when asked whether their knowledge of guidelines contributed to their decisions with respect to the \"patient \"in the videotape, 75% of the physician subjects, said \"no\": There were no significant differences in the use of guidelines depending on physician gender ( p=1.0) level of experience ( p=.69), or their interaction ( p=.69). For the purposes of this paper, clinical guidelines developed by ACC/AHA/ACP-ASIM (Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Chronic Stable Angina 12,13 for CHD were used as 1 useful gold standard (recognizing there are others) against which physician decision making could be assessed. The clinical actions recommended in these guidelines were grouped into 5 categories, following the logical order of theencounter: information seeking, physical examination, test ordering, drug prescriptions, and life style recommendations. Whereas chest x-ray is not required for all patients with CHD,the guidelines strongly recommend it if there is evidence of congestive heart failure, valvular heart disease, pericardial disease, aortic dissection, or pulmonary disease. Validity of the Experimental Approach With every study there is some trade off between internal andexternal validity. The present experimental study has excellent internal validity, but its external validity can be questioned. Four precautionary steps were taken to enhance externalvalidity, that is, whether the responses subjects gave represent the care they would truly provide. First, to achieve clinical authenticity of the scenario, physicians provided expertiseduring script development and were present during filming,where professional actors played the patient roles. Second, when physician subjects were asked how typical the \"patient \" viewed on the videotape was compared with patients in theireveryday practice, 92% considered them very typical or reasonably typical. Third, the doctors viewed the tapes in the context of their practice day (not at a professional meeting, acourse update, or in their home). In other words, it was likely they saw real patients before and after they viewed the \"patient \"scenario. Fourth, the doctors were specifically instructed to view the \"patient \"as 1 of their own patients and to respond as they would in their own practice. RESULTS We present primarily main effects results. There were a number of significant 2-way interactions, but there was noconsistent pattern. The significant 2-way interactions are discussed below when they modify significant main effects. Results from the experiment are divided into 3 main groups. First, we examined the proportion of physicians who would follow the clinical guidelines for the management of CHD. Second, we focused on the influence of 4 patient attributes(gender, age, race, SES) and their relation to guideline adherence. Third, we examined the influence of 2 provider characteristics (physician gender, age/years of clinical experi-ence). Thus, our experimental approach permits unconfound-ed estimation of 5 different influences on physician behavior.1. The Extent of Guideline Adherence Figure 1summarizes the proportion of Massachusetts primary care physicians randomly sampled by design cellwho would follow clinical guidelines when encountering the \"patient \"presenting with symptoms of CHD. A high percentage would obtain a medical history (83%), order anECG/EKG (88%), examine the heart (74%), lungs (76%), and abdomen (78%), and order a stress test (75%). Compared to our guidelines standard, many physicianswould obtain incomplete information on pain (durationand relieving factors), would not examine peripheral extremities and the neck, and would not order a glucose test or chest x-ray. Only a small proportion (6%) wouldrecommend an increase in physical activity. Whereas there is high adherence to some guideline proscriptions (over 50% of primary providers would follow a third of them)there is low adherence to many of them (less than 20% of providers would follow a third of actions) recommended in t h eg u i d e l i n e s .T h e r ew a sh i g ha d h e r e n c e( > 5 0 % )concerning the acquisition of information regarding pro- voking factors and patient history; the examination of the heart, lungs and abdomen; ordering EGG, hemoglobin,and stress tests; and making dietary recommendations.There was lower adherence (<20%) regarding the acquisi- tion of information regarding the duration of pain, factors that relieve it, and family history; the examination of theextremities and neck; ordering glucose tests and x-rays; and making recommendations to increase exercise level. 2. Influence of Patient Attributes The influence of the \"patient 's\"gender on CHD guideline adherence is depicted in Fig. 2. Female patients are significantly less likely to receive 4 of the 5 componentsof the physical examination: cardiac (heart; 84% of men (26% vs 9%). Whereas many of the patient genderdifferences in CHD guideline adherence do not reach statistical significance, there is general consistency in the results. The female \"patients \"received less than males on 2/3 of the specific clinical actions suggested in the guide- lines (16 of the 23 listed). Figure 3summarizes results concerning the effect of \"patient \"age (55 vs 75 years) on CHD guideline adherence. The only significant difference concerned the recommen- dation that the \"patient \"stop smoking-younger \"patients \" were twice as likely (40%) to receive such advice as older\"patients \"(23%, p<.04). No significant differences or consistent patterns were evident with respect to either the race (White vs Black) orsocioeconomic status (lower vs higher) of the \"patient \"and physician adherence to guidelines. 3. The influence of Physician Characteristics Figure 4summarizes the overall (main) effects of physician level of experience as to whether they follow guidelines when encountering a \"patient \"with CHD. The gender of the physician in the study did not appear related to his orher adherence to the CHD guidelines. A physician 's level of clinical experience, however, did produce several signifi- cant findings. Table 2shows that older/more experienced providers were more likely to inquire about factors pro- voking chest pain (for older patients), to order a glucose test (for male patients) and to prescribe short-acting291 McKinlay et al.: Physician Adherence with Clinical Guidelines JGIMnitrates (62.5% of more experienced physicians vs 21.9% of less experienced physicians, p<.0001). There was a consistent pattern (although results did not achievestatistical significance) of younger/less experienced doc-tors conducting all 5 components of the physical exami- nation, whereas the older/more experienced physicians were more likely to order all 6 of the tests listed. DISCUSSION In this experiment, we provided physicians with a standardizedclinical scenario to examine their clinical decision making, andcompared this against 1 recognized standard of clinical guide- lines for the evaluation of possible CHD. We found that whereas there was high physician adherence to some of the clinicalguidelines for management of CHD, many physicians would not follow others \u2014less than 50% would adhere to 2/3 of the specific recommendations. Moreover, characteristics of both the pro-vider and the patient appear to play a role in adherence to guidelines. The gender of the \"patient \"appears to be influential: female \"patients \"received fewer of the actions recommended by clinical guidelines for the diagnostic evaluation of CHD. A\"patient 's\"age significantly affected a physician 's recommen- dation to quit smoking. An explanation for this may be found in the reaction of a physician colleague who stated, \"I understand this result. I 've got older patients and I 've been going on foryears about their smoking. They 're never going to quit. I 've really tried and I 've given up. \"A physician 's years of clinical experience were also associated with significant differences:less experienced doctors conducted more components of thephysical examination, whereas more experienced physicians were more likely to recommend diagnostic testing. The use of clinical guidelines as the gold standard for clinical care was chosen for several reasons: they are a) thought to reflect a consensus opinion based upon the current medical evidence (panels of experts from professional socie-ties), and b) a useful standard because they include history of symptoms, clinical examination, diagnostic testing, and life- style and pharmacologic intervention recommendations. It isnoteworthy that several parts of the clinical history and physical examination are inadequately addressed, as these are inexpensive and provide potentially critical information toelucidate the problem. The majority of physicians included thetwo diagnostic tests directly related to diagnosis of CHD, namely EKG and stress testing, whereas there was greater variability on tests for related or alternative diagnoses, such asglucose testing for undiagnosed diabetes, or chest x-ray for alternative diagnosis. Considering those guidelines directly concerned with diag- nosing and treating CHD and unstable or new angina, we find that providers generally follow the testing guidelines well, but are less adherent to those pertaining to historical information,and early treatments with aspirin, beta blockers or short- Figure 1 .

Yaxis = actions recommended by clinical guidelines.292 McKinlay et al.: Physician Adherence with Clinical Guidelines JGIMactivating nitrates. Likewise, the general differences in eliciting historic information suggests that these differences are impor- tant and could account for some of the gender disparitiesobserved. Guidelines that relate to primary and secondary prevention, or assessment of important comorbidities may be considered less important at the first evaluation, and thustheir lower use by physicians is perhaps understandable. Some of the variability from the guidelines may reflect timing issues, where providers would postpone beta blocker therapy until after EKG and exercise stress testing, when the extent ofdisease and potential risk of unstable angina is understood. However, the prescription of short-acting nitrates or aspirin are recommended for their potential protection against cardiacevents, even in this case of \"heartburn \"where upper gastroin- testinal pathology may account for symptoms. The lack of exercise counseling could reflect caution until the diagnosis isestablished, but the same would not hold for the 2/3 of providers who would not recommend smoking cessation. Our findings corroborate and extend the work of others, and indicate that even when there are evidence-based guidelinesfor the management of a condition as common as suspected CHD, some physicians 'use of guideline activities continues to lag. This has been identified in other conditions as well. Forexample, regular monitoring of blood sugar is considered essential to the effective treatment of diabetes and preventcomplications 14. However, Saaddine and colleagues15found that only 29% of diabetic patients reported having their blood sugar tested during the previous year. Another study byMcGlynn and colleagues 4found that 24% of diabetic patients received 3 or more glycosylated hemoglobin tests over a 2-year period. Grant and colleagues5found fewer than half of all diabetics with elevated glycosylated hemoglobins had a changein medication, and only 10% of patients with elevated blood pressure readings had a change in management. Our results show gender differences in the initial evaluation of possible CHD in women. Prior literature suggests reduced rates of revascularization, or delay in care for acute coronary events in women compared to men, as an explanation forhigher morbidity and mortality for CHD in women 16-22. However, our findings suggest that gender disparities in evaluation may begin even earlier in the clinical history andphysical examination for CHD. Our findings did not show a main or interaction effect by physician gender. That is, female physicians did not providemore guideline-based care to either male or female patientsthan did their male counterparts. Similarly, we found no differences based on patient race in recommendations for guideline appropriate CHD care. The findings based on physician experience are mixed. Whereas more experienced providers ordered more diagnostic Figure 2 .

Blue bars = male.293 McKinlay et al.: Physician Adherence with Clinical Guidelines JGIMtesting when the \"patient \"was older, their less experienced counterparts conducted more thorough physical examina-tions. The reduced behavioral counsel to older patients in thevignette may reflect a bias that older patients are lesslikely to adopt smoking cessation and other behavioral change. How- ever, some evidence suggests that older patients are as or more likely to adopt change 23. Limitations Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, whereas the rigorous experimental design permits excellentinternal validity, external validity remains a threat. Fourprecautionary steps were taken to hopefully minimize this threat (physicians were involved in script development; study subjects [physicians] were specifically asked how typical the\"patient \"was compared with patients in everyday practice; subjects viewed the tapes in the context of their practice day; subjects were specifically instructed to view the \"patient \"as 1 of their own patients). Second, the response rate of 64.9& (while high for a study of US physicians in the present climate) means over a third of those eligible and selected did not agreeto participate. This is an unavoidable consequence of the decision to randomly sample in an attempt to increase thegeneralizability (external validity) of the research findings. Third, the level of adherence to guidelines may depend onwhich guidelines are selected as the gold standard. Theguidelines used in this research were recommended by clinical colleagues as promulgated by a reputable professional organi- zation and considered to have wide visibility among providers.They are clearly only 1 set among many different guidelines developed by numerous groups. Future research could inves- tigate whether any variability in physician adherence isguideline specific. Implications The implications of this study rest on the assumption that physicians need to adopt and adhere to evidence-based guidelines in their everyday practice. Evidence-based diseasemanagement strategies, including early use of aspirin and short-acting nitrates, cannot reach their full potential if not incorporated into clinical care. The widely reported genderinequalities in coronary heart disease are unlikely to be reduced if improvements in the illness behavior of women (personal risk assessment, symptom recognition, and earlierhelp-seeking) are not matched by appropriate diagnoses, test ordering, and lifestyle recommendations by providers 24.

Whereas there is considerable literature addressing patient barriers to adherence to treatment recommendations, less is written on the barriers in clin ical practice to physician adherence to recommendations. Some authors cite inadequateprofessional training 25, especially the limitations of training of primary care providers to address so many complex medicalconditions. Others cite reimbursement policies that reward procedures over evaluation and management. Other barriers to adherence to guidelines include provider concerns about\"cookbook medicine \", perceived regulatory intrusion into prac- tice and unwillingness to buy into the concept of management guidelines. Other barriers may be a lack of systems support,such as electronic medical records, which incorporate guide- line management recommendations to ensure uniformity in care; or lack of patient participation in decision support 26. Lastly, the number of guidelines propagated and the lack of concurrence among them make it difficult for providers to find a clear consensus on the best management practices27.

The algorithm has been evaluated using datasets consisting of 30 physical gymnasium activities collected from a total of 21 people at two different labs. On these activities, we have obtained a recognition accuracy performance of 94.6% using subject-dependent training and 56.3% using subject-independent training. The addition of heart rate data improves subject-dependent recognition accuracy only by 1.2% and subject-indepe ndent recognition only by 2.1%. When recognizing activity type without differentiating intensity l evels, we obtain a subject- independent performance of 80.6%. We discuss why heart rate data has such little discriminatory power. 1. Introduction Automatic detection of physical activity (PA) might enable new types of health assessment and intervention tools that help people maintain their energy balance and stay physically fit and healthy. Recent research has shown that wearable acceler ometers can be used to reliably detect some physical activity types when tested on small datasets (e.g.[1-4]). We are unaware; however, of work showing the same algorithm can detect not only activity type but also, in some cases, the same activity at different intensities. Furthermore, most work with accelerom eters has either used cumbersome wired sensors [3] or sensors that store data locally for off-line processing [1, 4, 5]. Here we show how wireless sensors transmitting raw data in real-time (and thus susceptible to signal loss) could be used for automatic PA and PA-intensity recognition. Past work in recognizing activities from accelerometer data has used computationally intensive supervised classification algorithms that typically require offline analysis [2, 3, 6]. In this work, we utilize fast Decision Tree (DT) classifiers (as in [1, 4, 5]) with a set of efficiently computable features to achieve real-time performance on current PCs. DTs can overfit to the data if sufficiently diverse training sets are not used. Therefore, we test on a relatively large dataset (compared with prior work) consisting of 30 gymnasium activities (see Table 1) collected from 21 participants by two different teams. We also study the usefulness of heart rate (HR) data in discriminating the intensity of activities. HR may be useful since it correlates with energy expenditure for aerobic exercise; however, alone it provides little information about activity type, and it is influenced by other factors such as emotional states, ambient temperature, and fitness level. HR also responds and stabilizes slowly. In this work we explore the \"best- case\" scenario of how well ac tivity type and, for some activities, intensity can be recognized when we place one accelerometer at each limb and the hip, and a HR monitor on the chest. 2. System overview and data collection The PA recognition system consists of five triaxial wireless wearable accelerometers sensors sampling at 30Hz, a wireless HR monitor based on the Polar chest strap (Wearlink), and a laptop computer with a wireless receiver. These sensors allow data to be collected from multiple body points simultaneously without constraining movement [7] . To acquire training data for the PA recognition system, a total of 21 participants between 18 and 65 years old and with varying levels of physical fitness were recruited at two separate medical labs: (1) The Boston Medical Center and (2) Stanford Medical School. Using cotton elastic sweat bands or non-restrictive adhesive bandage s, researchers placed the accelerometers on each subject, with one at each of the following locations: top of the dominant wrist just behind the wrist joint, side of the dominant ankle just above the ankle joint, outside part of the dominant upper arm just below the shoulder joint, on the upper part of the dominant thigh, and on the dominant hip, as indicated in Figure 1b. All the accelerometers were \u00b110G except the accelerometer on the hip, which was \u00b12G. The HR monitor was worn on the chest. After the sensors were placed, each participant was asked to sit still and, after a stabilization period, resting HR was measured by measuring pulse for one minute. The participant's age-predicted maximum HR (MHR=220-age) was calculated. A combined 21 participants each perform ed 30 gymnasium activities for 2min each, with 12 and 9 datasets being collected from each site, respectively. The list of gymnasium activities, broken down by type and intensity differences, is shown in Table 1. The activities with different intensity levels are walking , cycling , and rowing . For walking , we varied intensity by changing the treadmill speed (e.g. 2, 3, and 4 mph) and inclination (e .g. 4, 8, and 12 degrees). For cycling , we varied the cycle speed (e.g. 60, 80, and 100 rpm) and the cycle resistance level to settings that participants subjectively considered equivalent to light, moderate, and hard. Finally, for rowing , we kept the rowing speed constant at 30 spm and varied the resistance until reaching leve ls that participants considered light, moderate, and hard. In total, 16.6 hours of usable annotated data were collected. In the remainder of this work, G1 refers to the gym dataset collected from site one and G2 refers to the dataset collected from site two. Dataset G2 differs slightly from dataset G1; due to lab constraints, data for the move weight , and calisthenics (cali.) activities were not collected, and the rowing activity was substituted by arm ergometry . Nevertheless, dataset G2 contains the same number of activities with different intensity levels as G1 ( walking , cycling , and arm ergometry ). Researchers interested in using these datasets should contact the authors. 3. Activity recognition algorithm In the training step, data segments not labeled as one of the target activities listed in Table 1 are discarded. The 15 acceleration data streams (x, y, and z axes) were then broken into 50% overlapping sliding windows of length 4.2s and independently interpolated using cubic spline interpolation to fill out missing sensor values lost during wireless transmission. In Section 4, we describe how 4.2s was selected as the window size. If the percentage of samples lost inside a given window of length 4.2s was greater than 20% for any of the accelerometer axis streams, the window was discarded. To smooth out the noisy HR data, we applied a running average filter over the past 30s of data. The HR data is then segmented by accumulating the data over 30s windows from the end time of each acceleration (a) (b) Figure 1.

HR windows are discarded when no samples are available for a given window. Overall, only 3.2% of the data (32.2m of 16.6h) collected were dis carded due to accelerometer signal loss and 1.9% due to HR signal loss. Time domain and frequency domain features are then computed for each 4.2s window. Here we use the area under curve (AUC) and variance to capture signal variability, mean distances between axes and mean to capture sensor orientation with respect to ground for postures, entropy to differentiate activity type, correlation coefficients to capture simultaneous motion of limbs, and FFT peaks and energy to discriminate between intensities. All the features are computed over each acceleration axis. The only feature computed over the HR data was the number of heart beats above the resting HR value (BPM-RHR). Finally, we used the WEKA toolkit [8] to evalua te the performance of the C4.5 DT [9] (pruned) and the NB classifier using one Gaussian distribution per feature per class. 4. Evaluation To evaluate the performance of the recognition algorithm, we computed the true positive rate, false positive rate, precision, recall, and F-Measure over the segmented classes using subject-dependent and subject-independent training. In subject-dependent training, we performed 10-fold cross-validation over each subject's data and averaged the results over all the subjects. In subject-independent training, we trained the algorithms with the data of all the subjects but one and tested the performance on the left-out subject. We repeated this procedure for as many subjects as we had and averaged the results. To better understand the performance of the algorithms, the results are clustered into three categories based on activity type: (1) postures (e.g. lying down , standing , and sitting ), activities with (walking , rowing/arm ergometry , and cycling ( running , calisthenics , move weight , and using stairs ). 4.1. Subject dependent analysis We first determined the most appropriate window length to use (4.2s) by varying the window length from 0.5 to 17 seconds and measuring the performance of the C4.5 classifier over the datasets. A window of 4.2s is long enough to obtain a good accuracy (74-86%) while minimizing real-time classification delay. Using a similar strategy, we determined that using only two FFT peaks provided good performance. We then performed feature selection over subsets of all the features using the wrapper method and the C4.5 classifier. The most powerful features found, in decreasing order of importance, were the area under curve (93.1% accuracy using only this feature), mean distances between axes (92.1%), mean (91.3%), variance equently, we measured the performance of the C4.5 DT and the Na\u00efve Bayes (NB) classifier over the best performing subset of these features that we call variant features: area under curve (15 values), mean distances between axes (15), mean (15), variance (15), FFT peaks (60), correlation coefficients (105), energy (15), and entropy (15) for a total feature vector with 255 values. Table 2 shows the performance measures using these features over both datasets (4.2s windows). Table 2 shows that the performance is comparable using both classifiers. As a result, from this point on, we present results only fo r the C4.5 decision tree classifier. From Table 2, we can also observe that the performance is higher for dataset G2. We believe that this is because G2 contains 8 fewer activities than dataset G1 as explained in Section 2. Another important result is that we have achieved an average false positive rate of only 0.15% over both datasets. A problem we encountered was that features with the highest discriminant power, such as AUC and the mean, are strongly sensitive to the acceleration signal magnitude and thus dependent on sensor orientation, and calibration. Consequently, we considered utilizing only features invariant to the signal magnitude. After evaluating the performance of subsets of these features using the C4.5 DT classifier over the datasets, we found that the best subset of features was: mean distances between axes, vari ance, energy, FFT peaks, and correlation coefficients, (225 values in total). Activity Dataset Classifier Postures (%) Other (%) Intensity (%) Total Accuracy positives (FP), precision (P), recall (R) and F-measure (F) for subject-dep endent analysis using the variant features Activity Dataset Features Postures (%) Other (%) Intensity (%) Total Accuracy positives (FP), precision (P), recall (R) and F-measure (F) for subject-dep endent analysis using the C4.5 DT and invariant features. Table 3 presents the performance using these features we call invariant. Ov erall, the C4.5 classifier achieved an average accuracy of 94.9% on both datasets, an accuracy as good as the one obtained using the non-invariant features (94.9%). After analyzing Table 3 and the confusion matrices, we observed that most of the errors were occurring when the classifier was tryi ng to discriminate between the different intensity levels of the same activity. To further explore this, we creat ed a new dataset that we call the no-intensities dataset where activities with different intensities, such as all the walking activities, were merged into one class. When we trained the C4.5 classifier using the invariant features over this new dataset, we found an improved performance of 97.3 \u00b1 0.7 on G1 and 98.7 \u00b1 0.4 on G2, or an average improvement of 3.3%. The next step was to investigate if HR data could improve the discrimination among the intensity levels of an activity. To test this, we added the number of heart beats above resting HR (BPM-RHR) to the invariant features. Table 2 shows the result. The average performance over both datasets is 95.8%, an improvement of 1.2%. In order to investigate wh y the HR feature has such a low impact on improving the discrimination between intensity levels, we trained the C4.5 classifier using only the HR. The recognition performance obtained was 34.0 \u00b1 6.0 for G1 and 49.2 \u00b1 6.7 for G2 using subject-dependent training. Overall, the results are higher for G2 because it contains fewer activities (8) than G1. After plotting misclassification histograms, we observed that the errors were concentrated at the beginning and end of activities. This is because HR lags physical activity and remains altered once the activity has finished (errors at the end of activity or beginning of the next one). Furthermore, for vigorous activities of short duration such as walking up stairs, HR increases constantly, resulting in classifications errors all across the activity. 4.2. Subject independent analysis For the subject-independent an alysis, we repeated the same procedure as the one followed in the previous section. Table 4 shows the results over the invariant features with and without incorporating HR. The overall performance is relatively low, with an average accuracy of 56.3% (FP: 1.5%) using the C4.5 classifier on both datasets. When the HR feature is added, the average performance improves only 2.1%. To better understand why the HR feature has such a low impact on improving the discrimination between intensity levels, we trained the C4.5 classifier using only the HR feature. The recognition performance is as follows: 12.3 \u00b1 1.7 for G1 and 14.4 \u00b1 2.7 for G2 using subject-independent training. Consequently, we believe that HR does not improve discrimination in subject-independent traini ng because subjects have different fitness levels and the number of beats above resting HR (BPM-RHR) is different for two subjects performing the same activity but with different levels of physical fitness. To mi nimize the effects of the physical fitness level of each individual, we repeated the experiment when HR (BMP) is normalized to lie between resting HR (RHR) and maximum HR (MHR) for each individual (MHR estimated as 220-age). Using this normalization, two individuals with different fitness level performing the same activity could have different BMP values, but relative to their MHR, they could be performing in the same intensity zone. Unfortunately, the results were similar to those obtained when not scaling the HR data. This may be because the MHR was estimated rather than measured. After analyzing the c onfusion matrices we also observed that most of the errors were occurring when the classifier was trying to discriminate between the different intensity levels of an activity. Furthermore, when we train the C4.5 classifier (subject- Activity Dataset Features Postures (%) Other (%) False positives (FP), precision (P), recall (R) and F-measure (F) for subject-independent analysis using the C4.5 DT and invariant features. independent) using the no-intensities dataset and the invariant features, we found an improved performance of 81.1 \u00b1 11.9 for G1 and 80.1 \u00b1 19.4 for G2. This means that (1) the classifi er is indeed confusing between intensity levels and (2) that the subject-independent performance when no intensity levels are present is reasonable. 5.

Prior work suggests that cancer causing genes and canc er susceptibility gene s can be identified. Methods: We conducted a genome-wide association study (Aff ymetrix 100K SNP GeneChip) of cancer in the community-based Framingham Heart Study. We report on 2 cancer traits - prostate cancer and breast cancer - in up to 1335 participants from 330 families (54% wome n, mean entry age 33 years). Multivariable-adjusted residuals, computed using Cox proporti onal hazards models, were tested for association with qualifying SNPs (70, 987 autosomal SNPs with genotypic call allele test p 0.001) using generalized estimating equa tions (GEE) models and family based association tests (FBAT). Results: There were 58 women with breast cancer and 59 me n with prostate cancer . No SNP associations attained genome-wide significance. The top SNP associations in GEE models fo r each trait were as follows: breast cancer, rs2075555, p = 8.0 \u00d7 10-8 in COL1A1 ; and prostate cancer, rs9311171, p = 1.75 \u00d7 10-6 in CTDSPL . In analysis of selected candidate cancer susceptibility genes, two MSR1 SNPs (rs9325782, GEE p = 0.008 and rs2410373, FBAT p = 0.021) were associated with prostate cancer and three ERBB4 SNPs (rs905883 GEE p = 0.0002, rs7564590 GEE p = 0.003, rs7558615 GEE p = 0.0078) were associated with breast cancer. The previously reported risk SNP for prostate ca ncer, rs1447295, was not included on the 100K chip. Results of cancer phenotype-genotype associations for all autosomal SNPs are web posted at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/ gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007 . Conclusion: Although no association attained genome-wide significance, several in teresting associations emerged for breast and pros tate cancer. These findings can serve as a resource for replication in other populations to identify novel biologic path ways contributing to cancer susceptibility.Published: 19 September 2007 BMC Medical Genetics 2007, 8(Suppl 1):S6 doi:10.1186/1471-2350-8-S1-S6<supplement> <title> polymorphisms resource</p> </title> <editor>Emelia J Benjamin, Caroline S Fox, Daniel J Gottlieb, Cashell E Jaquish, Daniel Levy, James B Meigs, Christopher 2007 Murabito et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Furthermore,prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men and breast cancer is the second lead- ing cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Family his- tory is a well established risk factor for both breast andprostate cancer providing evidence for underlying geneticfactors contributing to cancer occurrence. Accumulatingresearch has identified a number of candidate genes andbiologic pathways associated with increased susceptibility to cancer. However, even the most penetrant mutations, such as in BRCA1 and BRCA2 , account for only 5-10% of cases and are present in <1% of the general population.Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a com-prehensive approach to identification of genetic variantsassociated with cancer risk unconstrained by existingknowledge and may permit detection of common genetic variants each with small associated cancer risk but great public health impact. Reports from two recent GWASdemonstrated the importance of this approach with thediscovery of novel loci for breast cancer susceptibility[2,3]. Four SNPs in the FGFR2 gene were strongly associ- ated with breast cancer and the association was confirmed in a sample of cases and controls derived from three addi- tional studies [3]. We used the Framingham 100K genotyping cancer phenotypes. The FHS offers the advantage of a prospective longitudinal family-based community sample with participants who have been well-character-ized throughout adulthood with respect to risk factors anddiseases, including cancer. We report results of two com-plementary strategies to identify genome-wide associa-tions with cancer phenotypes: 1) a simple low p-value SNP ranking strategy; and 2) 100K SNP associations within candidate genes and regions previously reported tobe associated with these cancers in humans. Methods Study sample The genotyped study sample comprised 1345 Original cohort (n = 258) and Offspring (n = 1087) participants from the 330 largest FHS families. The Overview [4] pro-vides further details of this sample. There were 250 partic-ipants in the sample with cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) including 58 women with breastcancer, and 59 men with prostate cancer. The Boston Uni- versity Medical Center Institutional Review Board approved the examination content of Original Cohortand Offspring examinations. All participants providedwritten informed consent including consent for genetic studies. Cancer phenotype definitions and residual creation The 5209 Original Cohort participants have been exam- ined biennially since study inception in 1948 and the5124 Offspring Cohort participants (children of the Orig- inal Cohort and spouses of the children) have been exam- ined approximately every 4 years since enrollment in1971. Cancer cases were identified at routine examina-tions or by health-history updates for participants whodid not attend an examination. Medical records werereviewed by two independent reviewers (BEK, GLS). The vast majority of cancers were confirmed by pathology reports; <3.4% of cancer cases were based on death certif-icate or clinical diagnosis alone. The 1976 World HealthOrganization ICD-O coding was used to classify all pri-mary cancers. Hence, topography, location (subdivisionof site), histology or morphology (cell histopathology),behavior (degree of malignancy), and grade (histological grading & differentiation) were recorded along with date of diagnosis. Cancer cases reviewed through December31, 2005 were included in this study. The proportion ofwomen and men in the study sample with breast (8%)and prostate cancer (9%) respectively was similar to thatin the full FHS sample. Cox proportional hazards models were used to generate martingale residuals using the PHREG procedure in SASto perform the regression analysis of time from studyentry to cancer diagnosis or last contact free of cancer.Breast cancer was examined in women only and models were cohort-specific and adjusted for 1) age at entry and 2) age, parity, and body mass index at study entry. Forprostate cancer, in men only, models were cohort-specificand adjusted for age at http://research.marshfieldclinic.org/ genetics are described in the Overview [4]. SNPs were excluded if minor allele frequency <0.10 (n = 38062);genotypic call rate <0.80 (n = 2346); Hardy Weinbergequilibrium test p < 0.001 (n = 1595). There were 70,987 autosomal SNPs available for analysis after the exclusions. Statistical Analysis The statistical methods for genome-wide association anal- yses are described in detail in the Overview [4]. Whilethere are various suggested methods for interpretation of genome-wide significance, we chose to use a conservative (p < 0.05/10 -6 = 5 \u00d7 10-8) threshold to define genome- wide significance for this report.BMC Medical Genetics 2007, 8(Suppl 1):S6 http://www.biomedcen tral.com/1471-2350/8/S1/S6 Page 3 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)Association All cancer residual traits listed in Table 1 were computed using Cox proportional hazards models. The full set ofFHS participants with the phenotype were used to createthe residuals. The residuals were used to test for associa-tion between the genotyped subset of participants and theSNPs using family-based association test and gen- eralized estimating equation (GEE) models. FBAT analy- ses were restricted to at least 10 informative families. TheGEE tests tended to give an excess of very small p-valuesover what would be expected (see Overview [4]). SNP prioritization We used several strategies to prioritize SNPs associatedwith cancer traits. First, we used an untargeted approachwhereby SNP associations were ranked according to thestrength of the p-value for each trait. Next we identifiedcandidate genes reported to be associated with each can-cer trait from review of the literature. Candidate geneswere selected by searching PubMed (using susceptibility, gene, cancer and (breast or prostate) as keywords, last accessed 08-15-06), and the Entrez Gene and OnlineMendelian Inheritance in Man resources, as well as recenttext books. All available 100K SNPs in or near the a prioriselected candidate genes were investigated for associationwith cancer traits. Finally for prostate cancer, we also examined SNP associations in the region on chromosome 8 (8q24) previously reported to be associated with pros-tate cancer in Icelandic families and confirmed in threecase-control series [5] and African American men [6]. Fur-ther, for prostate cancer we examined the overlap in SNPassociations in our study and the top 500 ranked SNPs from the Cancer Genetics Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) project sponsored by the National Cancer Insti-tute. Because CGEMS used an Illumina platform for gen-otyping and the genotyping used in this study wasperformed with an Affymetrix platform, the gene_symbolfrom the UCSC annotation was used to link with CGEMStop 500 SNP list. Using this method, 1487 SNPs 100K SNPs with correlated with the CGEMS top 500 SNPs related to a known gene. SNPs were annotated with the UCSC genome browser tables using the May 2004 assembly http:// genome.ucsc.edu/ [7,8]. All genes within 60 kb of the top ranked SNPs were identified. The physical location of the SNPs was based on Build 35 of Genome for this report;however, the 100K web browser was based on Build 36. Results The cancer phenotypes available in the FHS 100K SNP resource, including details of the sample size, number of cancer events, and covariate adjustment for each trait arelisted in Table 1. In this report, we consider only two phe-notypes: breast cancer in women (multivariable-adjusted)and prostate cancer in men. Among participants in the100K sample the mean age at breast cancer diagnosis was59 years (range 35 to 83 years) in Offspring Cohort women and 70 years (range 35 to 97 years) in Original Cohort women; the mean age at prostate cancer diagnosiswas 66 years (range 43 to 85 years) in Offspring Cohortmen and 76 years (range 53 to 95 years) in OriginalCohort men. For each of the cancer phenotypes, Table 2 provides the top 15 SNPs ranked in order by lowest p-value for the GEEmodels and for the FBAT models (all SNP associations canbe viewed on the web) [9]. None of the SNP associationsachieved genome-wide significance (p < 5 \u00d7 10 -8) [4]. However, for prostate cancer, the top SNP in GEE models, rs9311171, is in CTDSPL (CTD {carboxy-terminal domain, RNA polymerase II, polypeptide A} small phos-phatase-like), a gene that may play a role in tumor sup-pression [10].

For prostate cancer, in GEE models rs906304 (rank 27, p = 0.000067), is in NCOR2 also known as SMRT . SMRT levels have been reported to be elevated in prostate cancer cells, and result in suppres-sion of anti-proliferative target gene actions for the vita-min D receptor [11,12]. In FBAT models, for prostate cancer SNP rs255561 (rank 17, p = 0.00039), is near XRCC4 , a gene that plays a role in DNA repair and rs1897676 (rank 50, p = 0.0012), is in PTPRD . Protein tyrosine phosphatases are signaling molecules involved inthe regulation of a variety of cellular processes includingcell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation [13]. For breast cancer in GEE models rs4146372 (rank 31, p = 0.00007), is near RAB21 , SNP rs9307561 (rank 0.0001), is FAT4 , and rs10512849 (rank 46, p = 0.00014), is in FGF10 . These genes appear to play biologic roles in a variety of processesincluding tumor growth and suppression [13,14]. In FBATmodels, for breast cancer rs2836391 (rank 46, p = 0.0012), is in ERG, an oncogene important in the devel- opment of prostate cancer [15,16]. Our second strategy was to identify from the literature candidate genes implicated in breast and prostate cancersusceptibility (see Additional data file 1). For prostate can- cer, we identified 63 candidate genes. Twenty of these can- didate genes had from 1 to 20 SNPs on the 100K chipwhereas the remaining genes had no SNP coverage on thechip. For breast cancer, 75 potential candidate genes wereidentified, 28 of these genes had between 1 and 35 SNPson the 100K chip and the remaining candidate genes were not covered on the chip. Two SNPs in MSR1 (rs9325782, GEE p = 0.008 and rs2410373, FBAT p = 0.021) were asso-ciated with prostate cancer and three SNPs in ERBB4 (rs905883 GEE p = 0.0002, rs7564590 GEE p = 0.003,rs7558615 GEE p = 0.0078) were associated with breastcancer (Table 3). For prostate cancer, a region on chromo- some 8q24 was recently reported to be associated with prostate cancer risk in Icelandic men and confirmed inthree case-control series of men of European ancestry andAfrican American men [5,6]. There were a total of 64 SNPson the 100K chip in this 8q24 region (128 to 129.3 Mbinterval). However, the reported risk SNP, rs1447295, wasnot included on the 100K chip and none of the 64 availa- ble SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium with the risk SNP. Five other SNPs in this region were associated withprostate cancer with a GEE or FBAT p-value < 0.01 (Table4). The National Cancer Institute commenced the CGEMS [17] initiative to conduct genome-wide association stud- ies to identify genetic factors related to prostate and breastcancer. We examined overlap between the top 500 rankedSNPs for prostate cancer in CGEMS phase 1a [18] and of the FHS 100K GWAS analysis for prostate can- cer. The physical position of the SNP was used to detect overlapping associations and the results are shown inTable 5. Of note, many of the associations in Table 5 arein SNPs with very low minor allele frequencies and theresults are presented according to minor allele frequency.WWOX gene, a tumor suppressor gene, that has been reported to play a role in prostate cancer [19], showed evi- dence of association (rs3751832, p = 0.0009) in our studysample. Discussion Breast and prostate cancer are the two most frequently diagnosed cancers in the United States and result in sub- stantial morbidity and mortality [1]. A number of breastand prostate cancer susceptibility genes and chromo-somal regions have been identified [2,3,5,20-34]. How-ever, currently known genes account for only a fraction ofthe familial aggregation of breast cancer [25] and fewprostate cancer susceptibility genes have even been identi- fied. Risk for these cancers is likely mediated through var- iation in many genes, each conferring a relatively smallrisk for the disease. Genome-wide association studies pro-vide an opportunity to discover novel genes and pathwaysthat play a causal role in cancer occurrence and in turnmay lead to new therapies for the prevention and treat- ment of cancer. Finding genetic associations with breast and prostate cancer risk that are robust across multiplestudies may facilitate the identification of high risk indi-viduals who can be targeted for early screening and pre-ventive interventions. We report GWAS results for breast cancer and prostate cancer phenotypes in a community-based sample ofadults from two generations of the same families.Although none of the SNP associations achieved genome-wide significance in GEE or FBAT models, this resourcehas the potential to detect novel cancer susceptibility genes and to explore the relevance of promising candidate gene associations to human cancer. Our results can becompared to those from other genome-wide associationstudies such as the National Cancer Institute's CGEMS[17]. Although the two studies used different genotypingplatforms limiting overlap in the SNPs examined, we wereable to determine the physical position of the SNPs. Using this strategy, SNPs in ErbB proteins are widelyexpressed in prostate cells [35] and may play a role intumor development, growth and progression in humanprostate cancer [36,37]. We also examined the 8q24 region previously associated with prostate cancer risk. CGEMS investigators recently reported a second inde-pendent risk SNP (rs6983267) within the 8q24 stronglyassociated with 2007, 8(Suppl 1):S6 http://www.biomedcen tral.com/1471-2350/8/S1/S6 Page 5 of 10 (page number for citation purposes)Table 2: Cancer Phenotypes for FHS 100K Pr oject: Results GEE SNP Chr Physical Position GEE p-value FBAT p-value Gene region (within 60 kb) GEE p-value FBAT p-value Gene (within 60 kb) tral.com/1471-2350/8/S1/S6 Page 6 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)GeneChip did not include either of the previously reported risk SNPs; however, we did identify five otherSNPs in this region associated with prostate cancer. The underlying biologic mechanism mediating prostate can- cer risk associated with the SNPs and chromosomal regionremains unknown. A two-stage approach, genome-wideassociation followed by selective genotyping of SNPs withsuggestive evidence of association, may provide an effi-cient strategy for pursuing initial genome-wide results [2,38,39]. Several important limitations merit comment. First, this study used cancer cases identified through surveillance ofa multigenerational community-based sample. Theenrollment and examination of Original Cohort and Off- spring Cohort participants began years before DNA collec- tion occurred. Thus, a survival bias may have beenintroduced. Our cases may be comprised of early-stagedand less lethal cancers. To address this potential bias, weadjusted for covariates using the full Framingham sample,and used the residual traits for the subset of individuals genotyped using the 100K Affymetrix GeneChip to test forassociation with the SNPs in linear regression models. Residual traits from Cox models typically are not ideally distributed for linear regression models, but our adjust-ment method using the full Framingham sample pre-cludes the testing of SNP associations with cancer traitsusing Cox models. Second, we had a small number of can-cer events (250 all cancer cases, 58 breast cancer cases and 59 prostate cancer cases) limiting our ability to detect SNP associations. In a recent small GWAS of age-related macu-lar degeneration that included 96 cases and 50 controls,an association with the CFH gene was identified [40] and confirmed in larger studies [41-43]. However, in thatreport, individuals homozygous for the CFH risk allele had a sevenfold increased likelihood of age-related macu- lar degeneration [40]. It is very unlikely that commongenetic variants for cancer phenotypes will confer a riskfor cancer susceptibility of that magnitude. For example,the odds ratio associated with the risk marker identified Table 3: All SNP Associations within Selected Br east and Prostate Candid ate Genes (up to 60 kb) Associations within Candidate Genes Selected by Cancer Type: FBAT or GEE p-value < 0.01 10%, Hardy-Weinberg test p 0.001, and 10 informative families for FBAT. The physical location of the SNPs wa s based on Build 35 of Genome; however, the 100K web browser was based on Build 36Table 2: Cancer Phenotypes for FHS 100K Pr oject: 2007, 8(Suppl 1):S6 http://www.biomedcen tral.com/1471-2350/8/S1/S6 Page 7 of 10 (page number not for citation purposes)for prostate cancer in region 8q24 was 1.72 in the com- bined Icelandic sample [5]. Furthermore, the associations between prostate cancer and the SNPs with low minorallele frequency (Table 5) are likely to be false positiveassociations given the small number of prostate cancercases in our sample. Third, the 100K Affymetrix GeneChipprovides limited coverage of the genome; many of our apriori candidate genes did not have any SNP coverage on the chip and coverage of some candidate genes that were present on the chip was suboptimal. Importantly, the rep-licated risk SNP, rs1447295, for prostate cancer [5] wasnot included on the chip. NHLBI has committed funds fora 550 K genome-wide scan on all FHS participants. Thiswill enable us to confirm our initial 100K SNP associa- tions in a larger sample with a greater number of cancer cases and with denser coverage of the genome. We did notexamine epistasis or gene-environment interactions which may modify the associations noted in this study. Lastly, most of our associations are likely to be due tochance. Replication studies are needed to determine if anyof the results we report are indicative of true associations.It is important that our data be used in conjunction withdata from other samples given the high probability offalse positive associations. Conclusion In summary, the untargeted genome-wide approach todetect genetic associations for cancer traits provides anopportunity to identify novel biologic pathways related tocancer occurrence and to direct future study of candidate genes that hold the most promise for relevance to cancer risk in humans.

Davis, PhD, Michael S. Wolf, PhD, MPH Background: Limited health literacy may be a contributing factor to racial disparities in health care. This study examined the mediating effect of limited health literacy on the relationship betweenrace and HIV-medication adherence. Methods: A total of 204 patients infected with HIV were recruited from two clinics in 2001. Structured in-person interviews were conducted to obtain information on patient demo-graphics, medication adherence, and health literacy. Multivariate regression models wererun in 2006 to examine the associations among race, literacy, and HIV-medicationadherence after adjusting for relevant covariates. Results: In an adjusted analysis that excluded literacy, African Americans were 2.40 times more likely to be nonadherent to their HIV-medication regimen than whites (95% condenceinterval [CI] /H110051.14-5.08). When literacy was included in the nal model, the effect estimates of race diminished 25% to nonsignicance. Literacy remained a signicantindependent predictor of nonadherence odds ratio [AOR] /H110052.12, 95% CI /H110051.93- 2.32). Conclusions: In this study, limited health literacy mediated the relationship between race and HIV- medication adherence. Investigators need to consider the potential utility of responding toliteracy and communication barriers in health care as part of interventions to reduce racialdisparities. (Am J Prev Med 2007;33(5):374-378) \u00a9 2007 American Journal of Preventive Medicine Introduction Recent studies have suggested that limited liter- acy in adults may contribute to racial disparitiesin health. 1-3This is important, as reducing disparities in health care is one of the two primaryfederal goals for public health in the United States. 4,5 According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), 90million people in the U.S. lack the literacy prociencyneeded to properly understand and act on healthinformation. 6This has often been referred to as health literacy, a reflection of both a patient's ability and theliteracy prerequisites of the healthcare system. 7Al- though limited health literacy has been associated withpoorer health outcomes, and also has been shown to be more prevalent among African Americans thanwhites, 1-3,8,9it is unclear whether racial differences in health literacy explain the presence of healthdisparities. In the context of HIV, individuals with low literacy skills have been more likely to possess a poor workingknowledge of their disease and its treatment. 10-15Kali- chman et al.10,11found that infected patients with limited literacy had less general knowledge of thedisease and their own treatment compared to patientswith adequate literacy, and that they were less likely tohave an undetectable viral load. While Paasche-Orlowet al. 16found no association between health literacy and HIV-medication adherence or viral load suppres-sion, Wolf et al. 15found that patients with low literacy were more than three times as likely to be nonadherent totheir anti-retroviral regimens than those with adequateliteracy. The HIV literature also documents substantial racial disparities in health outcomes. Most noteworthy, Afri-can Americans with HIV infection are at greater risk fora faster progression to AIDS and shorter survival incomparison to whites. 17,18Racial differences in med- ication usage contribute to disparities in health out-comes. 19-21Possible explanatory factors have been of-From the Health Literacy and Learning Program, Institute for Healthcare Studies, Feinberg School of Medicine, NorthwesternUniversity (Osborn, Wolf), Chicago, Illinois; Section of GeneralInternal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Boston UniversitySchool of Medicine (Paasche-Orlow), Boston, Massachusetts; andDepartment of Medicine-Pediatrics, Louisiana State UniversityHealth Sciences Center at Shreveport (Davis), Shreveport, Louisiana Address correspondence and reprint requests to: Chandra Y.

Recent studies have suggested that health literacy is a more powerful predictor of health status than race.1-3 What has yet to be presented are mediating analysesexploring health literacy as a determinant of racialdifferences in the performance of health-promotingbehaviors, such as medication adherence. As such, theobjective of this study was to examine the mediatingeffect of health literacy on the relationship betweenrace and HIV medication adherence. Methods Sample The study sample and methods have been described previ- ously in detail.13From June to September 2001, a total of 204 consecutive HIV-infected patients on one or more antiretro- viral medications were recruited from outpatient infectiousdisease clinics at the Northwestern Memorial Hospital (Chi-cago site) and the Louisiana State University Health SciencesCenter at Shreveport (LSUHSC). Patients who had been ontheir current regimen for less than 2 weeks were excludedfrom participation, as were those with one or more of thefollowing conditions, as noted in the medical record: (1)dementia, (2) blindness or severely impaired vision notcorrectable with eyeglasses, (3) deafness or hearing problemsuncorrectable with a hearing aid, and/or (4) too ill toparticipate in the survey. Approval for human subjects re-search was obtained from institutional review boards at bothstudy sites prior to consenting patients to the study. Data and Procedure Trained research assistants received referrals of interestedand eligible patients from clinic health providers, then en-gaged in an informed consent process and conducted astructured interview with recruited patients. All interviewswere conducted in a private room at each respective clinicimmediately prior to the patients' scheduled physician visits.Information gathered pertained to patient demographic in-formation, medication adherence, and health literacy. Demo-graphic questions specically included patient age, gender, race, level of educational attainment, employment status,monthly income, and health insurance coverage. Medication Adherence Patient anti-retroviral agents, as well as comorbidities andnon-HIV prescriptions, were obtained through medical chartreviews. Patients reported any recent missed doses usingpages that contained the names and color photographs ofcommon HIV medications included in a revised version of thePatient Medication Adherence Questionnaire (PMAQ). 26,27 The PMAQ requires patients to identify their medication and then report on a missed dose in the past 4 days for eachanti-retroviral agent. Specically, four questions were asked regarding whether the patient had missed taking a doseyesterday, the day before yesterday, 3 days ago, and over thepast weekend. Patients were rated as having proper adher-ence if they reported no missed doses in this time period,while those acknowledging one or more missed doses withinthis short timeframe were considered nonadherent. Health Literacy Patients were asked to read aloud as many words as they could from a word-recognition list composed of 66 health-related words, Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medi-cine (REALM), that were arranged in order of increasingdifculty. 28-30Scores were based on the total number of words pronounced correctly, with standard English pronun- ciation being the scoring standard. Correct pronunciation of0-18 words corresponded to a reading level of third grade orless, and correct pronunciation of 19-44 words corre-sponded to a fourth- to sixth-grade reading level. Patients whoscored from 0 to 44 were considered to have low literacy.Correct pronunciation of 45-60 words indicated a seventh- oreighth-grade reading level, and patients scoring in this levelwere considered to have marginal literacy. Correct pronunci-ation of 61-66 words indicated a reading level at the ninthgrade or above, and individuals with scores in this range wereconsidered to have adequate literacy. Data Analysis All analyses were performed in 2006 (Stata version 9). Chi- square and Student's t-tests were used to evaluate the associ-ations among race, literacy, self-reported missed medicationdoses, and other sociodemographic characteristics. Patientliteracy was classied as adequate (9th grade and higher),marginal (7th-8th grade), and low (6th grade and below).Race was entered as African-American or other. Multivariateregression models were used to analyze the mediational effectof literacy on racial disparities in HIV-medication adher-ence. 31Mediating variables were those thought to lie in a causal pathway between the main predictor variable and the outcome. First, the independent relationship between raceand medication adherence was established after adjusting forexogenous covariates (gender, age, income, number of med-ications in regimen, and non-HIV comorbid condition) andpotential interaction effects (Model 1). Education, insurance,and employment were not included in the multivariate modeldue to colinearity with either literacy or other socioeconomicvariables in the model. Due to the low prevalence of drug andalcohol abuse (self-report of treatment in past 6 months), thisvariable also was not included. Second, the relationshipbetween literacy and HIV adherence was to be tested, whichhad already been demonstrated and conrmed in a priorstudy using this same cohort. 15Finally, literacy was added to Model 1 as a mediator, and changes in odds ratios for race were analyzed (Model 2). This approach has been used by others to study the degree to which health behaviors mediate theeffect of socioeconomic status on health. 32Model calibration and discrimination were estimated using the Hosmer-Leme- show goodness-of-t chi-square test and the C statistic fromreceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. November 2007 Am J Prev Med 2007;33(5) 375Results Respondents had a mean age of 40.1 years (SD /H110059.2 years), 79.9% were male and 45.1% were African Amer-ican. More than half (55.9%) of respondents wereunemployed, 39.7% had an annual household incomeless than $10,000, and 52.9% were either covered byMedicaid or did not carry any health insurance. Over60% reported at least some college education. Approx-imately one third had either low or marginal literacyskills; 11.3% were reading at or below a 6th-grade level(low literacy), and 20.1% were reading at a 7th- to8th-grade level (marginal literacy). More than half(52.5%) of all patients were also receiving treatment fora non-HIV-related chronic illness. Nearly one thirdreported receiving mental health services, and 9.3%had received treatment for alcohol or illicit drug use inthe past 6 months. Over 70% were taking three or moreHIV medications. Demographic and clinical character-istics are shown in Table 1 .African-American patients were more likely to pos- sess marginal or low literacy skills compared to non-African-American patients (52.1% vs 14.3%, p/H110210.001), and were signicantly less likely to self-report adher-ence to their medication regimens in the past 4 days(60.1% vs 76.8%, p/H110050.014). Patients with low literacy were more likely to be nonadherent (52.2%) thanpatients with adequate literacy (30.0%, p/H110050.01). To conrm the association between race and the potential mediating variable (literacy), a preliminaryregression model was analyzed with African-Americanrace as the independent variable and low literacy skills as the dependent variable, controlling for age and study site.A signicant association between African-American raceand low literacy ratio [AOR]/H110057.4, 95% condence interval [CI] /H110051.49- 10.9). For Model 1 examining race and medicationadherence, African Americans were 2.40 (95%CI/H110051.14-5.08; C statistic /H110050.67) times more likely to be nonadherent to their HIV-medication regimen thannon-African Americans ( Table 2 ). As illustrated in Table 2 , when literacy was included in the second model, the effect estimates of African-American racediminished by 25% to a point of nonsignicance(AOR/H110051.80, 95% CI /H110050.51-5.85; C statistic /H110050.72). nonadherence (AOR 95% CI /H110051.93-2.32). and a greater number of medicines in thepatient's regimen were also signicantly associated witha greater likelihood of missed doses. Patients with anannual income below $10,000 and those also receivingtreatment for a non-HIV comorbid condition were lesslikely to self-report missed doses in the past 4 days. Discussion Understanding the reason for pervasive health dispari-ties across race and ethnicity is a major research,practice, and policy goal in the U.S. 33,34To provide new insights into the pathways that lead to health dispari- ties, patients were recruited from two U.S. regions toexamine whether health literacy mediates race dispari-ties in HIV-medication adherence. It was found thatAfrican-American patients had a twofold greater likeli-hood of being nonadherent to their anti-retroviralregimens. Yet consistent with predictions, the inclusionof health literacy reduced the explanatory power ofrace. In the nal model, health literacy, not race,signicantly predicted nonadherence. It is believedthat this study is the rst to examine health literacy as amediator of race for HIV-medication nonadherence. While the association between race and medication adherence was reduced by 25% once literacy was en-tered in the model, clearly other factors contributed toracial disparities. In this study alone it was found thattreatment-related aspects of regimen complexity andcomorbidity independently predicted adherence, asTable 1.

Interestingly, patients with the lowest annual household income or those who werecontending with a non-HIV comorbid condition weremore likely to be adherent than patients with higherhousehold incomes or those without a non-HIV comor-bidity. While these relationships were not entirely clear,it is possible that individuals with the least amount ofnancial resources were being identied by the health-care system as being at high risk and subsequentlyintervined upon. This also could be true for those withgreater comorbidity, although it is important to notethat only medication-taking behaviors were assessedand not health status or actual treatment outcomes.Future studies should seek to investigate in more detailthe role of other patient psychosocial characteristics,such as culture and social support, as possible medi-ators of the now well-established relationships amongliteracy, health behaviors, and outcomes. 6,35 Certain limitations to the study should be acknowl- edged. First, adherence could not be assessed using oneor a combination of other more objective measures, such as random pill counts, Medical Equipment Man-agement Systems (MEMS) caps, or pharmacokineticlaboratory assessments. Although an existing, validatedassessment tool was used to measure HIV-medicationadherence, 26,27through questionnaires patients might have underreported missed doses. However, several recent studies have concluded that self-reported mea-sures, such as the PMAQ, are viable and accurate meansto measure adherence. 20,36Second, these data were derived from a cohort of HIV-infected patients inter- viewed 5 years ago, and might not reflect directly theexperience of those on more current HIV-medicationregimens. While more recent advances offer the poten-tial for simplied and less restrictive dosing schedules,adherence still remains a signicant challenge forpatients with the disease. 37,38Therefore, it is believed that these ndings are relevant to the present day. Despite these limitations, this study is the rst to assessthe impact of limited health literacy in explainingracial/ethnic differences in medication adherenceamong a sample of patients from both urban and ruralsettings. Limited health literacy presents a wide-reaching bar- rier to disease prevention that, unlike race/ethnicity, ispotentially modiable, which is why this study hasimportant policy implications, particularly with respectto the development of communication strategies topromote HIV-medication adherence that are proven tobe effective with patients of all literacy levels. Mosthealth education materials describing medication man-agement and adherence have been written at the highschool or college level and may be difcult to under-stand by individuals with low literacy skills. 39The devel - opment of educational strategies that are both appro-priate for lower-literacy audiences and culturallysensitive may benet the large number of patients whoare at risk of nonadherence. 15,40-43The design of better medication instructions for patients with more- limited literacy, such as improved packaging, labeling,and dispensing practices, is sorely needed. 44Instruc - tional and educational improvements such as these mayhelp decrease the racial disparities in medication ad-herence; and, ultimately, contribute to reducing dispar-ities in the early development of AIDS and AIDS-relatedmortality.

Paasche-Orlow, MD, MA, MPH; Michael S. Wolf, PhD, MPH Objective: To provide an evidence\u00ad based review of plausible causal pathways that could best explain well-established associations be\u00ad tween limited health literacy and health outcomes. Methods: Through analysis of current find\u00ad ings in medical and public health literature on health literacy we derived a conceptual causal model. Results: Health literacy should be viewed as both a patient and a system phenomenon. Three dis\u00ad tinct points along a continuum of health care are suggested to be influenced by health literacy: (1) access and utilization of health care, (2) patient-provider relation\u00ad ship, and (3) self-care. Conclusions: The conceptual model organizes what has been learned to date and underscores promising areas of fu\u00ad ture inquiry and intervention. Key words: causal pathways, health literacy, literacy, concep\u00ad tual model Am J Health Behav. 2007;31(8uppl 1):819-826 Thou gh limited health literacy has been shown to be associated with worse health outcomes, I the causal pathways are not entirely known.v' and several projects have focused on explain\u00ad ing potential mechanisms.v\" This paper provides a review of the current evidence and proposes a conceptual model describ\u00ad ing the systemic, interactional, and self\u00ad care mechanisms by which limited health literacy is most likely to lead to worse Michael K.

By doing so, we begin to highlight some of the most promising areas for intervention research as well as important gaps in our current under\u00ad standing of the pathways linking literacy and health. This is one step in what will need to be an iterative process of model specification and clarification. It is our hope that investigators will increasingly pursue research designs and analytic approaches to refine the model so that the most valid and useful explanations of the relationship between health literacy and outcomes can inform professional re\u00ad sponses to the problem in the many di\u00ad verse contexts of health care.\" It should first be recognized that lim\u00ad ited health literacy is strongly associated with other socioeconomic indicators, in\u00ad cluding educational attainment, race/ ethnicity, and age.:\" Such associations make it difficult to discern the indepen\u00ad dent effect of health literacy from the complex relationships known between these latent and evolving traits that are also interrelated themselves. Yet many of the determinants of disease, in general, 519 Causal Pathways of Health Literacy are interconnected in complex ways.!' In this sense, the current model is focused on the direct pathways between literacy and health outcomes, while recognizing there are likely to be many indirect asso\u00ad ciations that will eventually need to be explored by researchers in greater detail. Definition of Health Literacy and Implications for a Causal Framework The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has defined health literacy as the \"degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. \"12,13 We agree with this statement. However, specific clarification is required. Accord\u00ad ing to this definition, health literacy re\u00ad lates to an individual's possession of req\u00ad uisite skills for making health-related decisions. This means that health lit\u00ad eracy must always be examined in the context of the specific tasks that need to be accomplished. When we refer to health literacy, we include not only a person's ability, but also the complexity of the tasks at hand. Much of the literature on health literacy focuses on the capacity of individuals in the context of health ac\u00ad tivities. However, we feel that it is impor\u00ad tant to underscore the importance of a contextual appreciation of health literacy, As such, causal mechanisms of the health literacy-health outcomes relationship are due not only to patient-level characteris\u00ad tics, but also to those attributes of the health care system. Therefore, the pro\u00ad posed conceptual causal model dia\u00ad grammed in Figure 1 recognizes both individual and system-level factors that affect access to health care, medical en\u00ad counters, and self-care activities. Access and Utilization of Health Care Patient factors. People typically ini\u00ad tiate medical care when they have a medical need. However, people with lim\u00ad ited health literacy may delay seeking care due to not understanding prevention and/or knowing the signs and symptoms of disease that should motivate people to action. Additionally, adults with limited health literacy may be less comfortable with the social interactions that occur in medical settings, worry that their limited literacy will be exposed, and often have feelings of shame .14 Similarly, limited health literacy has been associated with more distrust of providers, pessimism about treatment, lower satisfaction, and a worse assessment of the quality of care.15,16 As much of routine prevention is dependent on patients coming into pri\u00ad mary care, it is not surprising that people with limited health literacy receive less primary prevention.!\"\"? A concept that has been advanced to explain how people with limited health literacy may have difficulty with using health services is the notion of naviga\u00ad tion. The concept is meant to include all of the skills needed to go from one place to another in the pursuit of medical care. For example, people with limited health literacy have reported difficulty finding their way in health care facilities, likely the result of poor communication (verbal directions, signage and placards, com\u00ad plexity of instructions). To date, mea\u00ad sures of navigation in this sense have not been presented, and no data have been published that directly reveal how pa\u00ad tients maneuver their way through the trajectory of large and complicated health systems. Utilization of care, however, can be viewed as a global proxy measure of func\u00ad tional navigation. Multiple studies have described higher rates of emergency room utilization, hospitalization, and rehospi\u00ad talization. 15,2o'23 However, self-reported access to physician visits was not signifi\u00ad cantly worse for patients with limited health literacy;\" and among new Medi\u00ad care managed care enrollees, there were no significant differences in the mean number of primary care provider visits or the time to a first visit.\" Another study by Lincoln et al examined utilization of various health services without finding differences by level of literacy.s\" Unfortu\u00ad nately, as almost all of the data presented in the medical literature on health lit\u00ad eracy relates to patients evaluated in medical contexts, few studies have cap\u00ad tured the experience of people who re\u00ad main largely outside of the health care system. Millions of people are eligible but not enrolled in programs such as Medic\u00ad aid and other means-tested health ben\u00ad efits.\"? Although such factors have not been thoroughly examined, it is possible that shame or lack of understanding of potential benefits act as perceived barri\u00ad ers to enrollment, an important and un\u00ad explored pathway leading to worse health among patients with limited literacy. 520 Paasche-Orlow & Wolf Figure 1 Causal Pathways between Limited Health Literacy and Health Outcomes I Occupation I I Employment I I Income I I Social Support I Culture I I I Language I I Race/ Ethnicity + Health '\u00ad I Education ~ Literacy I Age r t Vision I I HearingI I Verbal Ability I I MemoryI I ReasoningI I ... ,... ,...

One consequence of having multiple nonprofit, for-profit, and government payers in the health care marketplace is that the US health care system has become increasingly compli\u00ad cated and confusing. The financial struc\u00ad ture of medical insurance is directly or\u00ad ganized around the idea that higher pre\u00ad miums command fewer logistical barri\u00ad ers to care. The rules and regulations of how to use health plans vary, and it is easy to misunderstand what services are covered and how to use various types of programs. Similarly, health programs do not comprehensively manage the flow of information that commonly has to be pro\u00ad cessed separately for medical, pharmacy, and dental benefits - if one has coverage. Am J Health Behav.P' 2007;31(8uppl 1):819-826 Furthermore, rule changes (eg, doctors are shifted out of network and medica\u00ad tions are dropped from formularies) fre\u00ad quently befuddle clinicians and patients alike. No metric has emerged for how much of the health disparity associated with health literacy might be due to the overall complexity of the health care sys\u00ad tem. Patient-Provider Interactions Patient factors. Knowing less about a disease may have broad ramifications on how patients with limited literacy inter\u00ad act with their providers. Patients mayor may not have insight into the fact that they do not know very much about their condition. Beyond the issue of how shame 521 Causal Pathways of Health Literacy might lead some people with low health literacy to avoid asking questions of their clinicians, low literacy may be associated more generally with worse patient activa\u00ad tion. In addition, low literacy has been linked to worse mental health function\u00ad ingand worse depression.26 ,28,29 These con\u00ad nections may lead patients with low health literacy to have a tendency to be more passive and may complicate the patient\u00ad physician interaction and lead to mis\u00ad communication. Provider factors. Providers tend to be unaware of their patients' limited lit\u00ad eracy.s''-\" However, it is not clear that even with such knowledge providers would be able to facilitate successful communi\u00ad cation. To do so, they would need to learn how to communicate in plain terms to confirm important items in a patient's history and evaluate patient comprehen\u00ad sion of important action items.7,32 Avoid\u00ad ing medical jargon is not always suffi\u00ad cient; though underutilized, pictures, multimedia, and decision aids can often help. Oftentimes, a great amount of infor\u00ad mation is relayed to patients, but provid\u00ad ers seldom evaluate patient comprehen\u00ad sion in any meaningful mariner.:\" Provid\u00ad ers frequently do not employ interview techniques that are useful for clinical encounters with patients with low lit\u00ad eracy. It is unclear how much of this problem is due to a lack of interviewing skills, a lack of engagement and commit\u00ad ment to patient education, or a maladap\u00ad tive response to imposed time pressures. During the fast-paced and potentially anxi\u00ad ety-driven encounter, patients with lim\u00ad ited literacy may be less responsive and reluctant to ask questions, admit confu\u00ad sion, use different descriptions of medi\u00ad cal problems than clinicians are used to, and provide less accurate information about their medical histories and medi\u00ad cations. 14,34,35 A patient-centered approach of con\u00ad firming comprehension, known as teachback, has been advanced as a new standard of care for clinicians. 36 Although this approach is sensible and will not put patients at risk, it is appropriate to note that evidence has not yet been presented showing that adopting universal precau\u00ad tions for confirming patient understand\u00ad ing in the medical encounter leads to improved health outcomes for patients with limited literacy. Similarly, although the teach-to-goal educational technique, in which a learner is asked to exhibit comprehension and gets repeated rounds of focused teaching until mastery is ex\u00ad hibited, has been advanced as a key method for improving comprehension, it has been shown to be effective only in a small and short study of adults with asthma.\" Comprehension of instrumen\u00ad tal activities, such inhaler technique, may play a significant causal role in chronic disease management; however, insufficient data have been collected to actually know if this will be a generaliz\u00ad able intervention approach. Self-care Patient factors. People with limited health literacy have been found not only to have lower levels of disease specific knowledge, but also to know less of the practical and instrumental knowledge critical to self-management such as which medication to take in an asthma exacerbation. In 2 studies, asthma knowl\u00ad edge mediated the relationship between low literacy and asthma-related skills (inhaler technique) and outcomes (asthma quality of life and treatment in emer\u00ad gency departmentl.P:\" Although few data have been presented, limited problem\u00ad solving skills and low self-efficacy have been suggested as well. Two recent obser\u00ad vational studies showed no association between self-efficacy and low Iiteracy.v'-\" however in 2 diabetes management in\u00ad tervention trials subjects with low lit\u00ad eracy have been shown to have more improvement than subjects with adequate literacy, which suggests a possible mod\u00ad erating role of self-efficacy. 38,39 Self-management requires not only the knowledge of what to do but also the will and capacity to carry out the health care plan. A critical element of successful self\u00ad management is medication adherence. On this front, the evidence has been mixed. Although patients with limited literacy have more trouble understand\u00ad ing primary and precautionary medica\u00ad tion label instructions and are less likely to be able to report the name of their medication, there is no consistent find\u00ad ing of worse medication adherence among patients with limited literacy. 40,41 Indeed, although Wolf et al found patients with low literacy and HIV to have a 3.3 (95% confi\u00ad dence interval 1.3 to 8.7) adjusted odds of nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy, Paasche-Orlow et al found patients with 522 low literacy and HIV to have a 1.9 (95% confidence interval 0.84 to 4.30) adjusted odds ratio of adherence.tv\" Little has been presented on the independent relation\u00ad ship between health literacy and specific healthy and unhealthy behaviors, yet 3 papers provide compelling evidence sug\u00ad gesting a lack of association between health literacy and unhealthy alcohol and drug use, among other risk factors.26,43.44 In light of other conflicting evidence de\u00ad tailing the association between low health literacy and medication adherence be\u00ad haviors,45-48 other proposed variables, such as self-efficacy to effectively manage the set of medication management tasks, might be important.\" However, DeWalt et al did not find a similar mediating rela\u00ad tionship of self-efficacy to the literacy\u00ad health outcomes relationship for glyce\u00ad mic control among type 2 diabetics.\"? Their study suggests other mediating factors, such as desire to participate in care and health knowledge. Extrinsic factors. Self-management is now the accepted term used to describe the day-to-day decisions and activities that patients, with the help of loved ones, engage in to live with and control their illnesses. 50-52 Patients need to interpret their symptoms and make decisions. Which over-the-counter medications will they use, and how should they use it? What is a side effect that warrants stop\u00ad ping a medication? When a provider gives a patient with low health literacy a pre\u00ad scription, will the patient know how to take it? Pharmacies typically fulfill their obligation to educate patients about their prescriptions by giving patient education materials that they cannot read. Simi\u00ad larly, patients contend with competing and confusing health messages from the news, the public health sector, and di\u00ad rect-to-consumer advertising. Patients with chronic disease are com\u00ad monly in the position of needing to moni\u00ad tor their condition and adjust their therapy. Because patients with low health literacy are less able to understand their disease and symptoms or to know how to monitor their disease (eg, peak flow meters), they also face greater difficulty using monitor\u00ad ing devices correctly (eg, glucometer) and may not be able to interpret results to know what to do (eg, increase Lasix dose]. A critical limitation is the lack of support\u00ad ive technology and 2-way data.36,53 Although most activities of self-care can be sup\u00adPaasche-Orlow & Wolf ported by technologies that allow remote synchronous or asynchronous assistance, few self-management support systems have been tested for use with patients with low literacy. 39,54 DISCUSSION In presenting a causal model, we add a word of caution that we do not offer a deterministic cause-and-effect schema. The model we have detailed takes the form of a component-cause model as is commonly undertaken in epidemiologi\u00ad cal research. 55 At one level, this could be merely an exercise in measurement of probability distributions (eg, How much of the relationship between a cause and an effect is ascribed to an intervening phe\u00ad nomenon?) and not the result of a crite\u00ad rion-driven process.\" The primary rea\u00ad son that the current model is not more heavily driven by empirical evidence is that relevant data are limited. Similarly, much of the literature on literacy and health has been cross-sectional, which limits attempts to determine cause and effect relationships. 57 Nonetheless, there are certain rules that govern what can be rightfully viewed as causal (eg, Does the cause precede the effect? Is the potential variance due to the cause deemed sig\u00ad nificant? Is the effect plausible?) such that subjective judgments based on ob\u00ad servations by investigators in the field can also contribute important details to the theoretical model we present.\" Though it is appealing to have a con\u00ad ceptual framework that incorporates the entire array of critical interrelated phe\u00ad nomena like socioeconomic status, ethnicity, environment, social support, and other variables thought to influence how people are affected by limited health literacy, there is also benefit from keep\u00ad ing the framework straightforward and unencumbered by controversies in other domains. For this reason, we have fo\u00ad cused on only the most direct paths be\u00ad tween literacy and health. Yet the model remains incomplete in its current form, as it does not address several areas of complexity that may later be revealed as having considerable importance for dif\u00ad ferent reasons. For instance, the model treats the concept of literacy as a single entity and ignores key problems in the field that stem from measurement is\u00ad sues. The concept of health literacy in\u00ad cludes multiple elements (eg, listening, Am J Health Behav. 2007;31(8uppl 1):819-826 523 Causal Pathways of Health Literacy verbal fluency, memory span, navigation) that are not entirely captured in current tests. Strictly speaking, even the current literature which is restricted to instru\u00ad ments that deal exclusively with the tasks of reading comprehension, word pronun\u00ad ciation, and calculation is challenging to interpret because studies have used vary\u00ad ing inclusion and exclusion criteria. 59 It is likely that the causal interactions are sensitive to what concepts are included in the dependent variable. Our proposed model also treats literacy as a fixed characteristic, even though it is subject to change over time; and de\u00ad pending on the cohort, the nature of change may not be easily predicted. Lit\u00ad eracy improvement can occur in a gen\u00ad eral sense (adult basic education) or in a specific health literacy fashion, such as a specific self-care skill.23 ,60 Literacy is also most likely to decline over time, in rela\u00ad tion to or independent of conditions that increase in prevalence as we age, such as dementia. The relationships depicted in our model might also be thought to imply that health literacy is a dichoto\u00ad mous variable. Though most studies have presented data in this way, the form of the relationship between literacy and vari\u00ad ous elements in the model should be considered an empirical question. How\u00ad ever, there is no reason to think that literacy will relate to health outcomes in a simple linear fashion; rather, a step function with a threshold effect may be more likely. One of the reasons that literacy may not relate to health outcomes in a linear fashion relates to the fact that people generally exist within a web of social relationships. Below a certain level of function, much of the day-to-day detail of chronic disease management often needs to be facilitated by others. Similarly, there are many clinical scenarios (eg, pediat\u00ad rics, dementia, severe cognitive impair\u00ad ment) in which the obvious focus of health literacy research needs to be directed to the literacy skills of the relevant care providers. Although the health impact of social cohort effects has not been fully elucidated in the context of health lit\u00ad eracy, the interaction between health literacy and social support is likely to have complicated and subtle implications, as patients with low educational attain\u00ad ment are more likely to have social sup\u00ad port from people who also have lower edu\u00adcational attainment than do patients with higher educational attainment. Finally, the model presented herein does not specify the nature of causation. Some variables appear to operate prima\u00ad rily as mediators (eg, people with low literacy have worse health outcomes due to the fact that they have worse knowl\u00ad edge), and other variables appear to oper\u00ad ate primarily as moderators (ie, people with low literacy have worse health out\u00ad comes due to the heightened dependence on social support].\"! There have been no longitudinal empirical evaluations to parse the manner in which many of the variables actually operate. Indeed, such effects can be difficult to elucidate, and a given variable may be both mediating and moderating in different contexts.v Each of these limitations relates to ways the model simplifies a multitude of complex relationships, yet exhibiting the multicausality inherent in the current model was a sufficiently complicated task that requires acknowledgment. 56 Re\u00ad searchers must begin to think more deeply about these relationships and, by doing so, explore the greater implications of the model for the design of appropriate inter\u00ad vention strategies. In turn, thinking con\u00ad ceptually about the different causal path\u00ad ways between health literacy and specific outcomes of interest may lead to the consideration of different approaches, pending the identified context. Ultimately, intervention efforts are better served by acknowledging the interdependence of the various sociocultural factors that need to be managed in order to succeed in promoting improved health care for those with limited health literacy.

KRAEMER, M.D., MARK RICHARD SAlTZ, M.D., ofPsychology, College ofArts and Sciences, Boston University. 648 Beacon Street, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215 ABSTRACT. Objective: We sought to determine whether depressive symptoms assessed during hospitalization predicted alcohol use and al\u00ad cohol-related problems during the subsequent year among medically ill patients. Method: The study sample was a cohort of hospitalized medi\u00ad cal patients with unhealthy alcohol use who participated in a random\u00ad ized controlled trial of an alcohol brief intervention. Depressive symptoms at baseline, assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Stud\u00ad ies-Depression Scale (CES-D), were used to predict alcohol use and problems at 3 and 12 months. Results: Of the 341 patients enrolled, 90% (men = 220; women = 88) provided data on at least one follow-up time point during the subsequent year. Gender-stratified longitudinal Pois\u00ad son regression models were fit for each alcohol outcome. adjusting for baseline values of age, physical symptoms, randomization group, alco\u00ad hol outcome, cocaine use, and socioeconomic indicators. Depressive symptoms were significantly associated with drinks per day (men: in\u00ad cidence rate ratio [IRRj = < IRR = \\.00 .98) and alco\u00ad hol-related problems (men: IRR < women: IRR = 1.05 per 10-unit increase in CES-D, p = .39) for men but not for women. They were not significantly associated with the number of days abstinent in men or women. Conclusions: In hos\u00ad pitalized medical patients with unhealthy alcohol use. depressive symp\u00ad toms predict subsequent drinks per day and alcohol-related problems among men. These findings suggest that symptoms of depression may be important to consider in treatment planning for male medical patients with unhealthy patterns of drinking. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs 68: 673\u00ad 680,2007) THERE IS CONSIDERABLE EVIDENCE to suggest that patients in medical settings have a higher preva\u00ad lence of alcohol-use disorders and exhibit more risky drink\u00ad ing behavior than the general population (Maisto and Saitz, 2003). This \"unhealthy drinking,\" which includes the spec\u00ad trum of drinking patterns that place one at risk for harm to alcohol dependence (Saitz, 2005), is also observed among those who use medical services more frequently (Chou et al., 1996; Curtis et al., 1986; Moore et al., 1989). The preva\u00ad lence of unhealthy drinking appears to be particularly high among hospitalized medical patients. These patients are more likely to report problems associated with their drink\u00ad ing (Jarman and Kellett, 1979; Moore et al., 1989) and meet criteria for alcohol-use disorders (Booth et al., 1998) than those in the community.

Amodei et al., for example, found that, of those who met criteria for an alcohol-use disorder in an urban primary care center, 38% experienced significant depressive symptoms within the past 30 days, compared with 13% of people without an alcohol\u00ad use disorder. Similarly, Alati et al. found that both male and female harmful drinkers in the emergency room, de\u00ad fined by cutoff scores on the Alcohol Use Disorder Identi\u00ad fication Test (AUDIT; Saunders et al., 1993), showed higher levels of depressive symptoms compared with those with lower AUDIT scores.

Although research suggests that medical patients with unhealthy drinking may exhibit more depressive symptoms, there is relatively little known about how these symptoms arc associated with subsequent alcohol-use patterns and al\u00ad cohol-related problems. Given that depression may be a transient consequence of changes in alcohol-usc patterns (Raimo and Schuckit, 1998), it is unclear whether depres\u00ad sive symptoms experienced by unhealthy drinking patients in the hospital provide any information about alcohol-use pattems during the subsequent year. Higher levels of de\u00ad pressive symptoms among medical patients with unhealthy alcohol use may be the result of the influences of alcohol\u00ad use patterns on depression (e.g., substance-induced mood changes) but also to a variety of shared causal mechanisms (e.g., socioeconomic factors) and influences of mood on alcohol-use motivation or self-regulatory functions (Li et aI., 2004; Swendsen and Merikangas, 2000). For example, the use of alcohol to cope with negative affect and life stressors may present a particular risk for unhealthy alco\u00ad hol use among patients with depressive symptoms (Holahan et al., 2003), an alcohol-use motive that has been associated with an increased incidence of alcohol-related problems (Cooper et aI., 2000; Gaher et al., 2006) and the develop\u00ad ment of alcohol-use disorders (Carpenter and Hasin, 1999). As the association between major depression and alco\u00ad hol-use disorders may be stronger for women (Grant and Harford, 1995; Kessler et al., 1997), and depression may be more likely to precede alcohol dependence among women than men (Hesselbrock and Hesslebrock, 1997), it is often thought that drinking to self-medicate depressive symptoms may playa more important role in the unhealthy drinking of women (see Schutte et aI., 1997). Although longitudinal studies with community samples appear to suggest that de\u00ad pressive symptoms may be a stronger predictor of long\u00ad term (2-10 years) alcohol outcomes for women than men (Hartka et al., 1991; Moscato et al., 1997), results from studies with shorter follow-up intervals (s I year) have not clearly supported a stronger link between depressive symp\u00ad toms and alcohol use among women (e.g., Aneshensel and Huba, 1983; Caldwell et aI., 2002; Graham et al., 2007), with some evidence suggesting that depression may be a risk factor for increased transitions to high-risk drinking for men but not for women among alcohol users who have experienced an alcohol-related problem (Crum et al., 200 I). Prospective studies of alcohol-treatment samples have also produced inconsistent findings regarding the effects of depression on alcohol use during the subsequent year, with some studies suggesting that indices of major depression may be associated with relapse following treatment for al\u00ad cohol dependence (Bobo et aI., 1998; Greenfield et aI., 1998) or greater risk of clinical deterioration (Ilgen and Moos, 2005), whereas others suggest that depression may be linked with better alcohol-related outcomes (Chamey et aI., 1998) or better outcomes for women (Rounsaville et al., 1987). Rounsaville et al. (1987) found that men with lifetime ma\u00ad jor depression had more alcohol-related problems and con\u00ad sumed more alcohol per day at 12 months following inpatient alcohol treatment compared with those without additional psychiatric diagnoses, whereas women with de\u00ad pression had better posttreatment outcomes. Depression has also been associated with better short-term alcohol outcomes in studies of both those referred for evaluation following a driving-while-intoxicated conviction (Windle and Miller, 1990) and alcohol treatment-seeking samples (Schutte et al., 1997), prompting some to suggest that depressive symp\u00ad toms may function to increase recognition of the need to change or to enter treatment for certain populations (Schutte et al., 1997; Wu et aI., 1999). Although the above community and alcohol-treatment studies have not produced results to clearly predict out\u00ad comes among hospitalized unhealthy drinkers, they do sug\u00ad gest that the association between depressive symptoms and alcohol outcome and the magnitude of this association for men and women may vary with the indices of alcohol in\u00ad volvement (Graham et aI., 2007; Schutte et al., 1997) and patient populations examined (Crum et aI., 2001). Currently, there is relatively little known about whether depressive symptoms predict subsequent alcohol use over time among medical inpatients. A better understanding of whether de\u00ad pressive symptoms have prognostic significance for un\u00ad healthy drinking among medical patients may be an important first step in the identification of risk factors and the development of interventions for this population. We sought to examine the association between depressive symp\u00ad toms and subsequent drinking outcomes among unhealthy drinkers on an inpatient medical service. Given the asso\u00ad ciation between depression and alcohol use among medical patients and findings from prospective studies with samples not specifically involved in alcohol treatment, we hypoth\u00ad esized that those with higher levels of depressive symp\u00ad toms during hospitalization would have fewer abstinent days, consume more drinks per day, and experience more alco\u00ad hol-related drinking problems during the subsequent year, controlling for corresponding baseline alcohol outcome vari\u00ad able. In addition, we explored the utility of different screen\u00ad ing thresholds that have been used to identify clinically significant depressive symptoms among this population us\u00ad ing the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D; Schulberg et aI., 1985; Zich et aI., 1990). Method Participant selection and recruitment Participants (N = 5,813) were screened for unhealthy drinking from the inpatient medicine service at an urban 675 PALFAI ET AL. hospital. Of the 986 that screened positive for unhealthy drinking, 341 patients were enrolled in a clinical interven\u00ad tion trial of brief intervention for alcohol use and signed an informed consent form before study participation. Inclu\u00ad sion criteria were an age of 18 or older and either con\u00ad sumption of risky amounts in the past 30 days (>4 drinks on a single occasion or > 14 drinks per week for men and >3 drinks on a single occasion or > 11 drinks per week for women) (Dawson et al., 2005; Fleming et al., 1997) or AUDIT scores of ..8 (Saunders et al., 1993). See Saitz et al. (2007) for inclusion and enrollment procedures. The AUDIT is a lO-item self-report measure that provides in\u00ad formation about alcohol use, symptoms of alcohol depen\u00ad dence, and alcohol-related problems. It has been extensively validated in medical settings as a screening tool for hazard\u00ad ous and harmful drinking (Conigrave et al., 1995; Saunders et al., 1993). We excluded those who scored below 21 on the Mini Mental State Examination (Folstein et al., 1975), had a specific intention to leave the metropolitan area in the subsequent year, could not provide two contact names, or were not fluent in either Spanish or English. The present study reports results from the 308 patients who provided fol\u00ad low-up data on alcohol use and problems at 3 or 12 months. Measures Primary outcomes. The three primary outcomes were drinks per day in the past 30 days, days abstinent in the past 30 days, and alcohol-related problems. The 30-day Timeline Follow Back (TLFB; Sobell and Sobell, 1992) was used to assess drinks per day and days abstinent. This semi-structured interview is used to assess the quantity, fre\u00ad quency, and types of standardized drinks consumed by the participant in the previous 30 days. The TLFB has been extensively validated as a measure of alcohol consumption and has been used to assess drinking patterns in medical patients. Alcohol-related problems were assessed by the Short Inventory of Problems (SIP-2R; Miller et al., 1995). This measure was developed as a short form of the Drink\u00ad ers Inventory of Consequences (Miller et al., 1995) and provides overall alcohol-related problem and subscale scores. It has been shown to have adequate internal reli\u00ad ability, stability, and validity among medical patients with unhealthy alcohol use (Kenna et al., 2005). Primary independent variable. The main independent variable was depressive symptoms assessed by the CES-D (Radloff, 1977). This is a 20-item self-report measure that has been extensively validated in community (e.g., Moscato et al., 1997), medical (e.g., Zich et al., 1990), and alcohol! drug-using samples (e.g., Bobo et al., 1998) to assess de\u00ad pressive symptoms and screen for clinical depression. Par\u00ad ticipants use a 0-3 rating scale to identify the frequency with which they have experienced various symptoms dur\u00ad ing the previous week. The scale includes four items (e.g., \"I was happy\") that are reverse scored. CES-D scores of more than 15 are typically used as a screening cutoff for major depression (Radloff, 1977). In the current study, the primary analyses modeled baseline CES-D scores as a con\u00ad tinuous variable. Secondary analyses were also performed to assess two potential cutoffs used in previous work with medical patients (Schulberg et al., 1985; Zich et al., 1990) to identify clinically significant elevated depressive symp\u00ad toms (> 15 and >26). Other assessments. A series of additional instruments were administered to patients at baseline that included mea\u00ad sures of demographics, physical symptoms, substance use, and alcohol-use disorders. Age, gender, employment status (i.e., typical employment pattern in the past 3 months), and homelessness (i.e., any nights in past 3 months spent on the streets or overnight shelter) were identified through in\u00ad terview questions (Kertesz et al., 2003). To address physi\u00ad cal symptoms, the Short Form 12 Health Survey (SF-12; Ware et al., 1998) was used. In the current study, the SF\u00ad 12 Physical Component Summary (PCS) scale was used to assess impairment in physical health-related quality of life. Cocaine and other substance use was assessed using the Addiction Severity Index (McLellan et a1., 1992). Current alcohol-use disorders were identified with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Alcohol Module (Robins et al., 1989; World Health Organization, 1996). This inter\u00ad view-administered instrument was used to determine cur\u00ad rent (past-year) diagnosis of alcohol abuse and dependence according to criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Andrews and Peters, 1998; CottIer et a1., 1997). Procedures Participants who enrolled in the study completed assess\u00ad ments at baseline, 3 months, and 12 months (Saitz et al., 2007). The full assessment battery took approximately 2 hours to complete and was conducted in the patient's hos\u00ad pital room. At baseline, participants were randomly assigned either to receive a brief (20-30 minute) motivational inter\u00ad vention following the assessment battery or to complete the baseline assessment battery only. Participants were con\u00ad tactcd by phone before each follow-up time point and were scheduled for a face-to-face interview. Statistical analyses We used descriptive statistics to characterize the study sample at enrollment. Preliminary models were fit for 3\u00ad and 12-month outcomes separately, and associations were generally consistent over time. Thus, the primary analyses incorporated both the 3- and 12-month outcomes into a single model using longitudinal generalized estimating 676 JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS / SEPTEMBER 2007 equations (GEE) regression methods. Separate multivari\u00ad able GEE Poisson regression models were fit to assess the associations between depressive symptoms and each of the three alcohol-related outcomes (i.e., number of drinks per day, days abstinent, and alcohol problems). The longitudi\u00ad nal regression models account for the correlation from us\u00ad ing repeated observations for the same subject. The GEE Poisson models were fit using an unstructured working cor\u00ad relation matrix and a log link. The empirical standard er\u00ad rors from the GEE approach were used for all analyses. The three outcomes were modeled as count data and the Pearson chi-square correction was used to account for overdispersion in the data. Poisson regression models were used for the analyses because the outcomes either were count data or nonnegative variables that did not follow a normal distribution (McCullagh and Neider, 1989). Inci\u00ad dence rate ratios (IRRs) presented from the Poisson regres\u00ad sion models represent the relative increase in outcomes associated with changes in each independent variable. For the main independent variable CES-D, the IRRs presented in Table 3 correspond to the relative increase in the alco\u00ad hol-related outcome associated with a 10-unit increase in CES-D. All models were stratified by gender, as the effects of depressive symptoms on drinking outcomes have been shown to differ by gender in prior research (Aneshensel and Huba, 1983; Crum et aI., 2001; Repetto et al., 2004). Depressive symptoms were assessed at study entry, and these CES-D scores were used to predict alcohol outcomes at the 3- and 12-month follow-up visits. Potential confound\u00ad ing factors that have been previously shown to be related to depressive symptoms and alcohol use (e.g., age and physi\u00ad cal health-related quality of life) were included as covariates in each of the regression models. Additional covariates in\u00ad cluded the baseline value of the alcohol-related outcome, cocaine use, randomization group, and postbaseline assess\u00ad ment time point. As a number of investigators have sug\u00ad gested that low socioeconomic status may account for the relation between depressive symptoms and alcohol use (Jones-Webb et al., 1996; Kim et al., 2003), we also in\u00ad cluded baseline employment status and homelessness (Kertesz et al., 2003) as covariates in regression models. Secondary analyses were conducted to assess two clinical cutoff scores for substantial depressive symptoms at study entry (CES-D > IS vs s IS and CES-D > 26 vs s 26). All analyses were conducted with two-sided tests and a signifi\u00ad cance level of .05. Analyses were performed using SAS software (Version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Results Descriptive statistics Of the original 341 patients enrolled in the trial, 308 lems at the 3- or 12-month outcome points. This final sample of patients was predominantly male (71 %) and had a mean (SD) age of 44.5 (10.5). As reported elsewhere (Saitz et al., 2007), the most common principal medical diagnoses were as follows: rule out myocardial infarction, asthma/ bronchitis/chronic obstructive pulmonary atitis, and cellulitis. Table I presents baseline characteris\u00ad tics of patients by gender. Participants in the study exhibited high levels of alcohol involvement as demonstrated by al\u00ad cohol use, alcohol-related problems (SIP-2R scores), and the proportion who were alcohol dependent. Among all pa\u00adtients, the median number of drinks per day was 3.6, and the median of the maximum number of drinks on a single drinking occasion in the past month was 14 drinks. In Table 2, we present the frequency and proportion of patients who met standard (>15) clinical cutoff scores for elevated depressive symptoms (Radloff, 1977) and a higher clinical cutoff score (>26) by gender and alcohol depen\u00ad dence. A large proportion of patients in the present sample met screening thresholds of >15 and >26. Indeed, among alcohol-dependent women, 90% of the patients had CES-D scores of more than IS. For both men and women, clini\u00ad cally significant elevated depressive symptoms were asso\u00ad ciated with alcohol dependence. Alcohol use and problems IRRs for the association between depressive symptoms and each of the three alcohol outcomes are presented by TABLE I.

The IRRs represent the rate of increase in a given drinking variable corresponding to a 10-unit in\u00ad crease in baseline CES-D scores. Among men, depressive symptoms were associated with intensity of alcohol use and alcohol problems. A 10-unit increase in CES-D score was associated with a 1.17-fold increase (95% confidence inter\u00ad val [CI): 1.06-1.30) in drinks follow-up and a 1.22-fold increase (95% CI: 1.10-1.35) in alcohol problems. Depressive symptoms were not associated with number of abstinent days among men. No significant associations were detected among women. Secondary regression analyses were conducted using CES-D scores (>15 and >26) that have been used in previ\u00ad ous work to screen for clinical depression in medical set\u00ad tings. Results of these analyses were consistent with those observed with the continuous measures. IRRs for each of these screening score thresholds are presented in Table 4. Regardless of the index chosen, depressive symptoms in the hospital remained a predictor of the number of drinks per day and alcohol-related problems over time for male patients. TABLE 3.

Discussion Despite evidence for the co-occurrence of depressive symptoms and unhealthy alcohol use among medical pa\u00ad tients, little previous research has explored the association between depression and subsequent alcohol outcomes among this population. The current study suggests that higher lev\u00ad els of depressive symptoms may predict worse alcohol out\u00ad comes among male medical inpatients with unhealthy alcohol use. Depressive symptoms experienced by these pa\u00ad tients in the hospital were associated with more drinks per day and alcohol-related problems over time even when con\u00ad trolling for corresponding baseline alcohol variables and potential confounders such as age, physical symptoms, co\u00ad caine use, employment, and homelessness. Depressive symp\u00ad toms did not appear to be prospectively associated with number of days abstinent, however, for either men or women. The predictive value of the CES-D was similar whether depressive symptoms were measured as a continuous or categorical variable. As expected, patients in this sample had high CES-D scores, with more than 65% of the male 678 JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS / SEPTEMBER 2007 sample and 80% of the female sample scoring more than the screening cutoff of 15. Because depressive symptoms are common for those who may be undergoing withdrawal from alcohol (Anthenelli and Schuckit, 1993) or experienc\u00ad ing physical distress from a medical condition (Clark et aI., 1998; Schulberg et aI., 1985; Zich et aI., 1990), there has been some debate regarding the value of different screen\u00ad ing cutoff scores to assess clinically significant depressive symptoms among medical patients (Fechner-Bates et aI., 1994; Schulberg et aI., 1987; Zich et aI., 1990). In the cur\u00ad rent study, baseline depressive symptoms as measured by continuous or different CES-D cutoff scores were similarly associated with drinks per day and alcohol-related prob\u00ad lems. The results do not address the question of whether different cutoff scores are most appropriate for identifying clinical depression in this sample but rather suggest that depressive symptoms have important implications for the development of alcohol-use patterns among male patients with unhealthy alcohol use regardless of whether these symptoms are measured as continuous or categorical vari\u00ad ables using screening threshold scores. The results of this study add to the body of research with urban medical populations (Crum et aI., 200 I; Jones\u00ad Webb et aI., 1996; Kim et a1., 2003) that have shown that depressive symptoms are associated with alcohol-use pat\u00ad terns among men. Although the expected association be\u00ad tween depressive symptoms and alcohol quantity was observed (Graham et aI., 2007), the strongest association observed between depressive symptoms during hospitaliza\u00ad tion and alcohol outcomes was observed with the alcohol\u00ad related problems. This is consistent with studies that have shown that a range of indices of distress are directly asso\u00ad ciated with alcohol problems independent of the effects of actual consumption (see Gaher et aI., 2006). The link between depression and alcohol use and prob\u00ad lems over time may be mediated by a number of factors, including reciprocal direct and indirect effects over time and shared underlying causal factors (Ramsey et aI., 1997; Swendsen and Merikangas, 2000). We explored the possi\u00ad bility that the association between depression and alcohol outcomes may be a function of economic stressors. A large proportion of the patients was unemployed, and many had experienced some degree of homelessness during the pre\u00ad ceding 3 months. Within our sample, however, socioeco\u00ad nomic status, as defined by homelessness and employment, did not account for the observed associations in this study. However, other sources of distress associated with urban poverty such as poor housing, crime, and a lack of oppor\u00ad tunity could exacerbate alcohol use over time and impair recovery efforts (Jones-Webb et aI., 1996; Kim et aI., 2003). These other potential shared causal factors may be impor\u00ad tant to examine in future work to better understand the nature of the depressive symptom-alcohol association. In addition to shared causal factors, future efforts to identify mechanisms underlying the link between depression and alcohol use and problems among men may benefit from assessment of the distinct functions of alcohol use among those with elevated depressive symptoms such as coping with negative affect (Cooper et aI., 2000; Holahan et aI., 2003) or providing sources of positive reinforcement (Vuchinich and Tucker, 1988). Given the findings suggesting that the association be\u00ad tween alcohol-use disorders and depression may be higher among women (Kessler et aI., 1997), it might be expected that depressive symptoms would also influence alcohol use and problems among women in this sample. There may be a number of factors that might account for the absence of effects among women. Depressive symptoms may influ\u00ad ence decisions about changing alcohol use (Schutte et al., 1997) differently for women in this population. Although depressive symptoms may increase motivation to use alco\u00ad hol to cope (Holahan et aI., 2004), they may also increase alcohol-related change processes associated with treatment engagement (Finney and Moos, 1995). These countervailing forces may both influence alcohol use and problems among those with depressive symptoms (Schutte et aI., 1997) and do so differently for different populations. Alternatively, the relatively high levels of depressive symptoms for women in this sample of predominantly alcohol-dependent individu\u00ad als may in part account for their lower value for predicting alcohol use and problems (Sung et aI., 2004). Although these effects were observed for men only, it is important to point out that the current stratified analyses demonstrate considerable overlap in confidence intervals of the IRRs for women and men. As the sample size for women was limited, the study may have been underpowered to detect differences within this group. Thus, the lack of a signifi\u00ad cant association between depressive symptoms and alcohol outcomes for women in the current study warrants future research. Limitations It is important to consider limitations of the present study for interpretation and generalizability. First, the present sample was urban, predominantly minority (38% white), poor, and markedly alcohol involved. Although the study enrollment procedures were designed to identify patients who exhibited a range of unhealthy alcohol use, the major\u00ad ity of patients was alcohol dependent. Although this sample may accurately reflect the patient sample in this type of context (Saitz et aI., 2006), it will be important to explore the association between depression and alcohol use among patients with different levels of socioeconomic status, envi\u00ad ronment (e.g., nonurban), medical services, and levels of alcohol involvement in future studies. Another limitation is that this study was conducted in the context of a brief in\u00ad tervention trial (Saitz et aI., 2007). Although the effects of 679 PALFAI ET AL. intervention were controlled in the analyses, these findings may not generalize to patients who are not participating in a randomized intervention trial. Finally, the current study used self-report measures of depressive symptoms and al\u00ad cohol use that required patient recall. Although we used procedures to minimize these sources of bias (Babor et aI., 1990), the effects of social desirability and memory must be considered in the context of this sample. Summary In sum, results of this study demonstrate that depressive symptoms predict drinks per day and alcohol-related prob\u00ad lems over time among male medical inpatients with un\u00ad healthy alcohol use. Although the psychological mechanisms that underlie this association remain unspecified, these find\u00ad ings suggest that depressive symptoms may be important factors to consider in the long term clinical management of unhealthy drinking men who are medical inpatients. Better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the associa\u00ad tion between depressive symptoms and unhealthy alcohol use may help refine hospital-based intervention strategies for this population.

Participants were surveyed on past 30 day substance use, past 6 month sexual behaviors, and STD in the past 6 months and =or over 24 months of follow-up. Logistic regression models adjusted for demographics found that cocaine usewas significantly associated with being sexually active (OR adj\u00bc2.3, 95% CI\u00bc1.1-4.8) and selling sex (OR adj\u00bc2.6, 95%CI\u00bc1.3-5.3). Alcohol and heroin were not significantly associated with sexual activity, high risk sexualbehaviors or STD in this sample.

INTRODUCTION Researchers and practitioners (1-3), the National Institute on Drug Abuse (4), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (5) have called forinclusion of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention effortsincluding sexual risk reduction in substance abuse treatment settings.Numerous studies demonstrate the high risk for sexually transmitted dis-eases (STDs) including HIV among patients in detoxification centers andthe efficacy of sexual risk reduction prevention programs in these settings (4, 6-12). Yet, in practice, state-mandated sexual risk reduction preven- tion efforts do not appear to be associated with reduced sexual risk beha-viors (13, 14). Use of a ''one-size-fits-all'' approach is likely inadequate fordifferential sexual risk practices across substance using groups; this undif-ferentiated approach may be one reason sexual risk reduction effortsproven efficacious in research studies are not promoting safer sexual beha-viors among detoxification patients in practice (4, 14). Certain substances, specifically alcohol, heroin, and cocaine, have been associated with higher prevalence of STD =HIV (4); these 3 sub- stances also represent the primary addiction of 81 %of people receiving substance abuse treatment in the United States (15). Thus, study of theassociations between use of these substances and sexual activity, includ-ing high risk sexual behaviors and STD among detoxification inpatientsmay be useful in helping identify patients at increased risk for STD =HIV. However, the high prevalence of polysubstance use in this population(15) requires such analyses to consider the independent contributions of these substances. The purpose of the current study was to assess the independent associations between alcohol to intoxication, heroin, andcocaine use and the outcomes of sexual activity, high risk sexual beha-viors, and STD among patients in a detoxification center. METHODS Subjects Study subjects were the 470 detoxification patients enrolled in the Health Evaluation and Linkage to Primary care (HELP) study, a randomized,controlled trial to link detoxification patients to primary medical careservices (16). HELP subjects were required to a) be English- orSpanish-speaking ambulatory inpatients at recruitment, b) report alco-hol, cocaine, or heroin as their first or second drug of choice, and c) haveno primary medical care provider. The study sample was 18-60 years old (median age 35 years), 24 %female, 46 %African-American and 37 %170 A. Raj et al. Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse Downloaded from informahealthcare.com by Boston University on 08/08/11 For personal use only. White; 48 %had been in detoxification treatment prior to this entry and within the past 6 months. Baseline behavioral data and baseline and fol- low-up self-reported STD data from this study were used for the currentcross-sectional analyses. Data Collection Procedures Eligible patients participated in a 90-minute baseline interviewer adminis- tered survey during their inpatient detoxification stay, after 48 hours ofarrival; they were again interviewed every 6 months over 24 months.Written informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to theirparticipation. Subjects were compensated modestly for their partici-pation. The Institutional Review Board of Boston Medical Centerapproved the study and, for additional protection, a certificate of confi- dentiality was obtained from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Measures Demographics including age, gender, and race were assessed via single survey items. Past 30 day alcohol use to intoxication (defined as having more than 3 drinks a day or ''feeling the effects''), heroin use, and cocaine use , the 3 main independent variables in this study, were measured using the Addic-tion Severity Index (ASI) (17). Subjects could report use of more than oneof these substances. High risk sexual behavior variables were measured using items from the Risk Assessment Battery (RAB) (18). These outcomes were assessed for the past 6 months and dichotomized to yield the following variables:sexually active ,inconsistent or no condom use ,multiple sex partners ,buy- ing sex with money or drugs , and selling sex for money or drugs . Any self- reported STD in the past 6 months was assessed at baseline and in each follow-up interview; STDs assessed included syphilis, gonorrhea, STDs (defined as ''crabs, Hepa-titis B, other, not HIV''), and pelvic inflammatory disease (women only). Data Analyses Initial analyses assessed the frequency of each of the substance use vari- ables and each of the sexual risk and STD outcome variables. To assess associations between each substance and the outcome variables, 6Alcohol, Heroin, and Cocaine and Sexual Behaviors 171 Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse Downloaded from informahealthcare.com by Boston University on 08/08/11 For personal use only. separate logistic regression models, adjusted for demographics, were fit for each outcome. Initial analyses included interactions between the 3 substance abuse variables to assess whether the effect of using a parti-cular substance depended on use of the others. Significant interactionswere not observed and the interactions were therefore removed in thefinal models. Associations were assessed using odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals. RESULTS Thirty-Day Prevalence of Alcohol to Intoxication, Heroin, and Cocaine Use At baseline, 80 %of the overall sample (n \u00bc375=469) reported drinking to intoxication; 38 %(n\u00bc177=470) reported heroin use; and 65 % (n\u00bc304=470) reported cocaine use. Twenty percent of the overall sample (n\u00bc93=469) reported alcohol to intoxication but no heroin or cocaine use; 7%(n\u00bc33=469) reported heroin but no alcohol to intoxication or cocaine; and 6 %reported cocaine use but no alcohol to intoxication or her- oin. (Note: One of 470 respondents did not answer questions on use ofalcohol to intoxication or heroin but did answer the question on cocaineuse; thus, denominators differ slightly across these 3 variables). Polysubstance use was common, with 66 %of our sample (n \u00bc309=469) reporting some combination of alcohol to intoxication, heroin, and cocaine in the past 30 days. Among subjects reporting any alcohol use to intoxi-cation, heroin and cocaine were used a mean of 6.4 and 10.8 days, respect-ively. Among subjects reporting any heroin use, alcohol to intoxicationand cocaine were used a mean of 11.2 and 8.7 days, respectively. Amongsubjects reporting any cocaine use, alcohol use to intoxication and heroinwere used a mean of 14.8 and 7.9 days, respectively. Eighteen percent ofour total study sample (n \u00bc84=469) used all three substances (i.e., alcohol to intoxication, cocaine, and heroin). Six-Month Prevalence of Sexual Risk Behaviors and STD Ninety percent of subjects (422 =470) engaged in sex in the past 6 months. These sexually active subjects (n \u00bc422) reported large proportions of high risk sexual behaviors: 55 %reported multiple partners; 68 % reported inconsistent or no condom use; 19 %bought sex for drugs or money; and 17 %sold sex for drugs or money. Consistent with this level of high risk sexual activity, 12 %reported an STD at some point during the 30-month assessment period. The proportions of subjects reporting172 A. Raj et al. Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse Downloaded from informahealthcare.com by Boston University on 08/08/11 For personal use only. sexual activity, high risk sexual behaviors, and STD were similar for the total sample and across the sub-samples of subjects reporting each sub- stance assessed. Associations Between Substance Use and Sexual Risk After controlling for the effects of alcohol to intoxication and heroin, among detoxification patients, cocaine users were significantly more likelythan non-cocaine users to report sexual activity in the past 6 months(OR adj\u00bc2.3, 95%CI\u00bc1.1-4.8) (Table 1). Among sexually active subjects, cocaine users were also significantly more likely than non-cocaine users to report selling sex (OR adj\u00bc2.6, 95%CI\u00bc1.3-5.3). Among sexually active subjects, nonsignificant but notable relationships were also observedbetween alcohol use to intoxication and sex bought (OR adj\u00bc1.8, 95% CI\u00bc.8-4.2), cocaine use and sex bought (OR adj\u00bc1.9, 95%CI\u00bc1-3.6), and cocaine use and STD (OR adj\u00bc2, 95%CI\u00bc.8-4.8). As females are more likely than males to sell sex and males more likely than females to purchase sex (19-21), gender-stratified analyseswere conducted to further assess associations between substance use and selling and buying sex. Selling sex was reported by 11 %of males (95%CI\u00bc7%-14%;n\u00bc322) and 36 %of females (95 %CI\u00bc27%- 45%;n\u00bc100); buying sex was reported by 23 %of males (95 % CI\u00bc18%-28%;n\u00bc321) and 5 %of females (95 %CI\u00bc2%-11%; n\u00bc100). Among sexually active subjects, logistic regression analyses including all substance use variables and controlling for age and racedemonstrated that cocaine was significantly associated with selling sexfor females (OR adj\u00bc9.1, 95%CI\u00bc2.3-36.4) but not males (OR adj\u00bc 1.5, 95%CI\u00bc.6-3.4). Given the small numbers of females reporting sex bought, associations between substance use and sex bought couldonly be assessed separately for males. Analyses with males demonstratedthat cocaine use was significantly related to sex bought (OR adj\u00bc2.4, 95%CI\u00bc1.2-4.8); a nonsignificant but notable association between alcohol to intoxication and sex bought was also observed for males(OR adj\u00bc2, 95%CI\u00bc.8-4.9). DISCUSSION In this cohort of detoxification inpatients, a substantial proportion of individuals with alcohol, heroin, or cocaine use was sexually active(90%) and reported high risk sexual behaviors. Over half of sexually active subjects reported multiple sex partners, and more than two-thirds did not use condoms or used them inconsistently.

Notably, proportions of sexual activity, high risk sex- ual behaviors, and STD prevalence were similar for subjects reportingalcohol to intoxication, heroin, and cocaine; this may be partly due tothe overlap of substances used by our sample. Overall, findings confirmprevious research demonstrating high risk sexual behaviors and a sub-stantial proportion with an STD diagnosis over time among detoxifica-tion patients (4), confirming the need for sexual risk reductionprograms for this population. While STD =HIV risk is an important issue for all detoxification patients, results from this study do suggest that those reporting recentcocaine use are at even greater risk for sexual activity, sex trade involve-ment (i.e., buying sex for males and selling sex for females), and contract-ing an STD, as compared with those not reporting recent cocaine use.These findings are consistent with previous research with detoxificationpatients documenting greater sex trade and STD diagnosis amongcocaine users compared with those reporting solely alcohol use (22, 23). Study findings suggest a need to prioritize sexual risk assessment and intervention, including consideration of the issue of sex trade, for detox-ification patients reporting recent cocaine use. Several limitations of the current study deserve mentioning. Use of cross-sectional analyses prohibits assumptions of causality; however,the associations found do inform us regarding levels of risk in detoxifica-tion patients at program entry. Reliance on self-report potentially resultsin social desirability and recall biases, although recall biases are likely minimal as timeframes for behavior assessment were short (i.e., past 1 to 6 months), and social desirability bias would have led to underesti-mates rather than overestimates of risk behavior and STD prevalence.Our STD diagnosis variable is not indicative of when the STD was con-tracted but only indicative of when diagnosis occurred; however, atworst, this is nondifferential misclassification that would not impact dif-ferences observed across substances. Finally, as subjects often combinedthe drugs of interest, pure analysis by drug was not possible; however, drugs are commonly used in combination, making our analyses more rel- evant in terms of characterizing the reality of patients in detoxificationcenters. Additional limitations include use of a single urban detoxification center, limiting generalizablity. The use of a relatively small sample sizeprecluded gender-stratified analyses and may have led to lack of statisti-cally significant findings for some associations, particularly low-preva-lence variables like STD. Research with larger samples and multiple diverse detoxification sites could further examine associations identified in the current work. Additionally, as the focus of the current study wasAlcohol, Heroin, and Cocaine and Sexual Behaviors 175 Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse Downloaded from informahealthcare.com by Boston University on 08/08/11 For personal use only. on associations between substance use and sexual risk for STD =HIV, analyses did not include injection drug use behaviors. While this was the appropriate approach for our research question, our current analysesare limited in their assessment of overall risk for STD =HIV among our injection drug-using participants (22 %of our sample); additional research is needed to explore sexual and injection drug use related riskfor STD =HIV among this subpopulation of patients. Implications for Practice. In order to achieve more effective STD =HIV prevention among high risk substance abuse treatment patients, moreintensive and better-tailored efforts will be needed to promote sexual riskreduction. Resource limitations may require identification of patients athigh risk for STD =HIV for these more tailored efforts. Study findings sug- gest that detoxification patients reporting cocaine use should be prioritizedfor intervention due to their heightened risk for sex trade involvement and STD as compared with nonusers of cocaine. However, high proportions of polysubstance use and high risk sexual behaviors for the sample as a whole,suggest that assessment of sexual risk should also occur at program entry,to ensure provision of tailored interventions for patients at greater risk forSTD =HIV regardless of reported substance used.

Rose, MD,* Bertina M. Backus, MPH, Susan T. Gershman, PhD, Palmira Santos, PhD,\u00a7 Arlene S. Ash, PhD,* and Tracy A. Battaglia, MD, MPH* Background: Most studies have found that black men are less likely to receive aggressive therapy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer, evenafter controlling for covariates. However, previous studies have notaccounted for the clustering of outcomes by facility.Objective: We sought to compare the proportions of black and white men receiving aggressive therapy for newly diagnosed non-metastatic prostate cancer between 1998 and 2002, accounting forthe clustering of outcomes by facility.Methods: We used the Massachusetts Cancer Registry of all cancer diagnosed in residents of Massachusetts. We used logistic regres-sion, clustering by the facility where the tumor was diagnosed, topredict the probability that a patient would receive any aggressivetherapy, and the specic therapeutic choices of radical prostatec-tomy, external-beam radiation therapy, and brachytherapy. Predic-tors included race, age, poverty, insurance status, marital status, yearof diagnosis, and tumor grade.Results: Black men were similarly likely to receive aggressive therapy compared with white men (odds ratio /H20851OR/H208520.79, 95% condence interval /H20851CI/H208520.62-1.01). However, there was a racial difference in the receipt of particular types of therapy: black menwere signicantly more likely to receive radiation therapy (OR 1.39,95% CI 1.16-1.68) and less likely to receive radical prostatectomy(OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.38-0.74).Conclusions: Among men diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer in Massachusetts from 1998 to 2002, black men receivedaggressive therapy at rates approaching those of whites. However,they were more likely to receive radiation therapy and less likely to receive radical prostatectomy. Key Words: prostate cancer, African American, health inequality, cancer control, health services (Med Care 2007;45: 440-447) The choice of primary therapy for prostate cancer is with- out clear guidelines, and much depends upon patient and tumor characteristics, and patient preference.1-3The decision is informed by the slow-growing nature of this tumor, and the many competing causes of mortality among mostly older menwho are treated for it. Many studies have considered radicalprostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, or brachytherapyto represent aggressive therapy, whereas any treatment strat-egy not involving 1 of these 3 is considered conservativemanagement. 4-11 A recent analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data between 1986 and 19994 found that non-Hispanic white men were more likely toreceive aggressive management for newly diagnosed prostatecancer than non-Hispanic black men. In the absence ofevidence that such a difference is causing harm to 1 of the 2groups, this remains a difference rather than an actual dis-parity in health care. 12However, black men are not only diagnosed with prostate cancer at a higher rate, but also die ofit at a higher rate 13; the fact that they have received less aggressive management could be part of the reason for thehigher mortality. Most previous analyses have found that, after adjusting for covariates, black men are less likely than white men toreceive aggressive therapy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer.However, although a growing body of research suggests thatit is necessary to adjust for the site of care when examiningracial disparities, previous analyses have not accountedfor the clustering of outcomes by the facility providingcare. 4,6,10,14-16Therefore, we analyzed data from the Massa- chusetts Cancer Registry with regard to the primary therapyreceived for prostate cancers diagnosed between January 1,1998 and December 31, 2002. We hypothesized that, afteraccounting for the clustering of outcomes by the facilityreporting the tumor to the registry, black and white menwould be equally likely to receive aggressive management.From the *Department of Medicine, Section of General Internal Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston Medical Center, Boston,Massachusetts; Center for Health Quality, Outcomes and EconomicResearch, Bedford VA Medical Center, Bedford, Massachusetts; Mas-sachusetts Cancer Registry, Massachusetts Department of Public Health,Boston, Massachusetts; and the \u00a7Massachusetts Comprehensive CancerControl Coalition, Boston, Massachusetts.

We collected information on the tumor stage, using the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system. We excludedpatients with stage 4, or metastatic, disease from our analy-ses, because the treatment decision for a patient with meta-static prostate cancer at the time of diagnosis is qualitativelydifferent than the decision for a patient with nonmetastaticdisease. Independent Variable and Exclusion Criteria: Patient Race We began with the entire cohort of men diagnosed with prostate cancer between January 1, 1998 and December 31,2002. We excluded all patients from the database whose raceand ethnicity were other than non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black, because their numbers were too small toallow for meaningful comparisons. Dependent Variable and Exclusion Criteria: Therapy Received Our primary outcome was the receipt of any aggressive therapy, dened as any therapeutic plan containing radicalprostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy (\"radiation ther-apy\"), or brachytherapy. Secondary outcomes included thespecic receipt of radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, orbrachytherapy. These outcomes were chosen in part to enableour results to be compared with the results of other analy-ses. 4-11Because our outcome variable was the primary treat - ment received, we excluded all men who did not have anyrecorded information under \"Date of First Course Treatment.\" Covariates To account for the clustering of outcomes, we adjusted for the facility that sent the initial report to the Registry aboutthe patient. Although we recognize that patients may not betreated at the facility where they are diagnosed, the facilitywhere the tumor is diagnosed represents the patient's entrypoint into the medical system and therefore may impact thetreatment options that are offered to the patient. Becausethere were facilities that reported fewer than 150 cases ofprostate cancer, or less than 30 cases per year, we combinedall such facilities into 1 group, which contained 50 facilitiesand 2177 patients (9.9%). The other group, which contained44 facilities, reported the remainder of the cases. Thus, ourcluster analysis had 45 levels, one for all of the small centerscombined and 44 for each of the remaining facilities. We collected each patient's census tract of residence, as a proxy for socioeconomic status. In accordance with dataand recommendations published by the Public Health Dispar-ities Geocoding Project, we used the percentage of people in each census tract living below the federal poverty line tostratify the census tracts in Massachusetts with regard tosocioeconomic status. 18,19We divided the patients into 20 equal quantiles with respect to poverty in the census tract of residence. We also collected the primary payer at the time of diagnosis, to control for the impact of insurance status on thetherapy received. This variable was divided into the follow-ing groups: Medicaid, uninsured, and all others (Medicare,HMO, PPO, and Federal Employees' Insurance). Male pa-tients must be severely disabled to receive Medicaid benetsin Massachusetts 20; therefore, we adjusted for Medicaid in - surance as a proxy measure for disability. Age, a proxy for life expectancy, plays a major role in treatment decisions for prostate cancer. We classied age atthe time of diagnosis into 9 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, and older than84. Married patients have been shown to be more likely toreceive aggressive therapy for prostate cancer 14; we dichot - omized marital status into married versus all others. We collected the Gleason Score to account for tumor grade, a measure of histologic aggressiveness. Gleason scoresof 4 or less were recorded as \"well differentiated,\" scores of5 and 6 were recorded as \"moderately differentiated,\" and scoresof 7 and above were recorded as \"poorly differentiated.\" Analyses We compared the primary therapy received by 2 racial groups: non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks. Weused a /H92732analysis to compare demographics between racial groups, and to compare the proportion of each group receiv- ing each treatment over the entire 5-year period. Then weconducted logistic regression analyses to predict receipt ofradical prostatectomy, external-beam radiotherapy (radiationtherapy), brachytherapy, or any aggressive therapy. The independent variable of interest was the patient's race: white or black. Covariates of interest included age, yearof diagnosis, tumor grade (Gleason score), poverty quantile,insurance status, and marital status. In our multivariableanalyses, an odds ratio /H110221 indicates an increased chance of receiving a therapy. For some variables, including the year oftreatment, the poverty category, and the age category, theodds ratio should be interpreted as \"per increasing category ofthe variable.\" For the other variables, a reference group wasused for comparisons. For the racial comparison, white non-Hispanic race was the reference group. For Gleason score,moderately-differentiated tumors was the reference group, asmost tumors fall into this category. For marital status, un-married was the reference group. For primary payer, thegroup containing Medicare and private insurance was thereference group. Initially, we conducted logistic regressions without ac- counting for the clustering of outcomes by the facility report-ing the tumor, to illustrate the results that might have beenobtained by performing the analysis without a cluster adjust-ment. Then, we repeated our analyses using generalizedestimating equations (GEE), taking into account the cluster-ing of outcomes by the facility reporting the tumor. The GEEMedical Care \u007f Volume 45, Number 5, May 2007 Predictors of Therapy for Prostate Cancer \u00a9 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins 441analyses properly produce larger estimates of the standard error, and hence wider condence intervals, than standardlogistic regression analyses. We also wished to examine the practical importance of whatever odds ratio we found regarding a racial difference.We began with the chance of an average white patient, age 62or 77, to receive any aggressive therapy. We then convertedthis chance of receiving any aggressive therapy into odds. Wethen multiplied by the odds ratio for the receipt of aggressivetherapy for a black patient, and converted the odds back into the percent chance for a black patient of similar age to receiveaggressive therapy. All analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.0. RESULTS Descriptive Statistics The Massachusetts Cancer Registry contains 25,465 cases of prostate cancer diagnosed between January 1, 1998and December 31, 2002. Of these, there were 584 Hispanicmen and 849 who belonged to other racial groups than whiteor black. In addition, there were 1942 men (9.2%) withincomplete data regarding treatment. The proportions withmissing treatment information among white and black pa-tients respectively were 8.2% and 11.8%. Finally, there were1036 men whose disease was stage 4, or metastatic, at thetime of diagnosis. The rate of metastatic disease at diagnosiswas 6.0% among blacks and 4.2% among whites. After theexclusion of these 4361 patients, our nal cohort contained21,104 non-Hispanic white or black men with nonmetastaticdisease at the time of diagnosis and complete treatmentinformation. According to US Census data from 2004, among men age 60 and older in Massachusetts, 93.2% of the populationwas white, 3.3% was black, and 3.5% were from othergroups. 21In the prostate cancer cohort of the Massachusetts Cancer Registry database, 91.4% patients were white, 5.3% were black, and 3.4% were from other groups. Thus, blackmen were represented in our prostate cancer database out ofproportion to their percentage in the general population,which is consistent with what is known about the relativeincidence of prostate cancer in black and white men. 13 Descriptive statistics for our study cohort are in Table 1. Black men were less likely to be married (63% vs. 78%)and more likely to have Medicaid insurance (8% vs. 1%).Younger black men were more likely to be diagnosed withprostate cancer than younger white men; for example, 6% ofblack patients and 3% of white patients were diagnosedbefore the age of 50. Unadjusted Analyses In unadjusted analyses, the age of the patient was highly predictive of the treatment received (Fig. 1). Youngerage predicted treatment with radical prostatectomy and withaggressive therapy in general. Men in their 70s were the mostlikely to receive radiation therapy. The use of brachytherapywas less common in the youngest and the oldest patients. Compared with non-Hispanic white men, non-Hispanic black men were more likely to receive radiation therapy(34.8% vs. 29.3%) and less likely to receive radical prosta- tectomy (32.0% vs. 37.8%; P/H110210.001 for both analyses). Overall, there was no statistically signicant difference interms of the receipt of any aggressive therapy (78.5% vs.79.4%; P/H110050.47) or the receipt P/H110050.17). Multivariable Analyses Tables 2-4 show the results of our multivariable re- gressions to predict the receipt of any aggressive therapy,radical prostatectomy, and external-beam radiation therapy.In our initial logistic regression without accounting for theclustering of outcomes, black race was predictive of a lowerodds of receiving any aggressive therapy (OR 0.79, 95% CI0.67-0.94). However, after using GEE to account for theclustering of outcomes by the facility reporting the tumor tothe registry, this effect was of marginal statistical signicance(OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.62-1.01). Among different types ofaggressive therapy, black men were signicantly less likely toreceive radical prostatectomy (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.38-0.74)and more likely to receive radiation therapy (OR 1.39, 95%CI 1.16-1.68). There was no racial difference in the receiptof brachytherapy (OR 1.00, data not shown).TABLE 1.

Therefore, we examined the practical implications of an odds ratio of 0.79 for a black patient toreceive any aggressive therapy. In our sample, the averagewhite patient of age 62 had a 90% overall chance of receivingaggressive therapy (Fig. 1). After multiplying by the oddsratio of 0.79, an otherwise similar black patient of the sameage would be 88% likely to receive aggressive therapy.Similarly, whereas a 77-year-old white patient had a 65%chance of receiving aggressive therapy, a 77-year-old blackpatient would have a 60% chance. After adjustment for covariates, poverty was not a statistically signicant predictor of the receipt of aggressivetherapy (OR /H110050.994, P/H110050.56). However, increasing pov- erty did predict a lower odds of receiving a radical prosta-tectomy (OR /H110050.978 per poverty quantile, 95% CI 0.966- 0.991). Patients with Medicaid insurance or no insurancewere less likely to receive aggressive therapy than the refer-ence group (OR for Medicaid 0.61, OR for uninsured 0.44;P/H110050.008 and P/H110210.001). In addition, married patients were more likely to receive aggressive therapy (OR 1.46, 95% CI1.31-1.63). Over time, there was a decreasing use of aggressive therapy for prostate cancer. In later years, patients were lesslikely to receive aggressive therapy for similar tumors, asreflected in the OR per increasing year of diagnosis (0.82,95% CI 0.78-0.87). In part, this change was due to aFIGURE 1. Different types of treatment of nonmetastatic prostate cancer, strati-fied by age group, in Massachusettsfrom 1998 to 2002. TABLE 2.

DISCUSSION We used the Massachusetts Cancer Registry to examine racial differences in the primary treatment received for pros-tate cancer from 1998 to 2002. In a logistic regression that didnot account for the clustering of outcomes, non-Hispanicblacks were less likely to receive aggressive therapy thannon-Hispanic whites. However, after accounting for cluster-ing, the condence interval for this nding crossed the nullvalue. This clustering procedure, by appropriately wideningcondence intervals, changed several results in our studyfrom signicant to nonsignicant, underscoring the impor- tance of this maneuver. Several previous analyses of the SEER-Medicare data- base have found mixed results regarding our primary ques-tion; however, none of these studies extends past 1999. In ananalysis of a SEER-Medicare database between 1994 and1996, Shavers et al 9found that African Americans and Hispanics were less likely to receive aggressive management, even after adjustment for comorbidity, life expectancy, and census tract of residence. In another SEER-Medicare analysisfrom 1991 to 1999, Zeliadt et al 11found that in an adjusted analysis, African American men were 26% less likely to receive aggressive management for their prostate cancer.TABLE 3.

In our study, non-Hispanic blacks were only modestly less likely to receive aggressive therapy, and the differencedid not attain statistical signicance. Our data is more recentthan that used in the other studies. In addition, our study is therst of its kind to account for the clustering of outcomes. Thisprocedure appropriately widened our condence intervals,especially for the race and poverty variables, suggesting thatvariations in practice between facilities in this regard arelarge. When outcomes cluster by the site of care, then afailure to account for such clustering may produce a decep-tively narrow condence interval. We translated an odds ratio of 0.79 into rates and found that actual differences in treatment between racial groups aresmall. For example, regarding 62-year-old men, white andblack men had a 90% and 88% chance of receiving aggres-sive therapy, respectively. Other studies have found largereffect sizes than an odds ratio of 0.79 for this racial differ-ence, but even these yield remarkably minor differences aftertranslation into rates. Using a point estimate of 0.74, as foundby Zeliadt et al, 11a 62-year-old black man would have an 87% chance of receiving aggressive therapy. Even with a point estimate of 0.64, as was found by Underwood et al,10 that man would still have an 85% chance of receivingaggressive therapy. Whereas a 5% difference between racialgroups might constitute a public health concern, a 2% differ-ence between groups seems quite small, especially whendifferences between different facilities overwhelm its statis-tical signicance. This study did not nd a statistically signicant differ- ence between racial groups in the receipt of aggressivetherapy. However, previous studies only found racial dispar-ities in certain subgroups of the population. In an analysis ofthe Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study, Hoffman et al 7found that among patients with more aggressive tumors, black patients received aggressive management 61% of the time,compared with 84% for white patients. In another analysis ofthe same data, Harlan et al 6found that when the adjusted analysis was stratied by age, black men above the age of 60 were less likely to receive aggressive treatment. To assess whether we would also nd racial differences in certain subpopulations, we repeated our logistic regression(with adjustment for clustering) to predict the receipt ofaggressive therapy, stratifying by whether the tumor exhib-ited aggressive characteristics (poorly-differentiated histol-ogy), as in the study by Hoffman et al. 7Race was a signicant predictor of aggressive therapy for the less-aggressive tumors (OR for black race /H110050.78, 95% CI 0.61-0.99). However, race was not a signicant predictor for the aggressive subsetof tumors (OR /H110050.81, 95% CI 0.50-1.30). Our ndings in this regard are the reverse of what was found by Hoffman etal. 7However, these 2 point estimates (0.78 and 0.81) are infact similar, suggesting that these 2 groups may receive similar care. We also repeated our logistic regression (with adjust- ment for clustering) to predict the receipt of aggressivetherapy, stratifying by age as in the article by Harlan et al. 6In the 60-and-over group, black race was not an independent predictor of the receipt of aggressive therapy (OR /H110050.84; P/H110050.22). However, in the younger age group, there was a nonsignicant trend toward blacks receiving less aggressivetherapy (OR /H110050.72; P/H110050.053), the opposite of the result found by Harlan et al. The point estimates diverge consider-ably between these older and younger groups, suggesting thatthere may be a larger racial difference in the receipt ofaggressive therapy among younger patients. Despite the strengths mentioned above, our study does have limitations. Our ability to demonstrate a small differ-ence in the face of a strong clustering effect based on thefacility reporting the tumor was limited by our sample size, aswe had only 1082 blacks in our database. As discussedearlier, 8.4% of our sample had missing treatment informa-tion. The proportion with missing treatment information diddiffer between white and black men (8.2% vs. 11.8%). If theabsence of treatment data is more often associated withconservative management, this might have biased our resultstoward the null. We did not control for pathologic tumor stage in our analyses. Radical prostatectomy may result in the \"up-stag-ing\" of a tumor from stage 1 to stages 2 or 3, whereas othertreatment options do not result in additional staging informa-tion. Thus, with regard to therapeutic choices, the role ofpathologic tumor stage is confounded by observation bi-as, 22,23in this case the differential ascertainment of patho - logic stages 2 and 3 when performing a radical prostatec-tomy. Therefore, the estimates for the effect of differenttumor stages on the therapy received are likely to be mis-leading and uninformative. Nevertheless, we did repeat ouranalyses, controlling for pathologic tumor stage, and none ofour estimates for the other variables changed appreciably. We could not adjust for the patient's level of prostate- specic antigen (PSA) at the time of diagnosis, as these datawere not available. The Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study hasdemonstrated that a PSA score above 50 at the time ofdiagnosis independently predicts increased odds of receivingconservative management (OR /H110053.3). 6If black patients had a higher PSA score at the time of diagnosis in our cohort, as has been found elsewhere,24-30then adjusting for PSA at the time of diagnosis might have moved the point estimates for the odds of receiving aggressive therapy even closer to thenull value. Therefore, this omission is likely to strengthenrather than weaken our results. In addition, we did not have data regarding medical comorbidities. Whereas the patient's age does tell us some-thing about his life expectancy, it clearly does not tell useverything, and life expectancy goes to the heart of thetreatment decision for prostate cancer. Our analysis wouldhave been improved by the addition of some mechanism toadjust for the effect of medical comorbidities.Medical Care \u007f Volume 45, Number 5, May 2007 Predictors of Therapy for Prostate Cancer \u00a9 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins 445Although we adjusted for Medicaid insurance, we did so primarily as a way to adjust for severe disability by proxy.Male patients in Massachusetts must demonstrate severephysical or mental disability to qualify for Medicaid, ratherthan merely demonstrating a certain degree of poverty. 20 Therefore, it is likely that considerations of life expectancy,expected quality of life, and ability to tolerate aggressivetherapies, rather than issues of insurance and reimbursement,informed the decision to provide less aggressive treatment ofthese patients. Finally, it would be an oversimplication to imply that the patient is merely a passive participant in the choice oftherapy for prostate cancer. Whereas it is the physician's jobto summarize the medical evidence as he or she understandsit, the patient brings his own values and preferences to thedecision, which will inform the decision regarding whether topursue aggressive therapy at all, and if so, which therapy tochoose. 3,31,32In addition, clinicians may not offer the same treatment options to different racial groups; Denberg et al have shown that urologists may be less likely to recommendradical prostatectomy to black patients who are sociallyvulnerable. 33As with any analysis of a large database, our study cannot differentiate between treatment disparities that arise as a result of the stated values of the patient andtreatment disparities that result from differences in access tocare or unrecognized bias on the part of the clinician. Our study suggests that racial differences are no longer an important target for remediation in the treatment receivedfor prostate cancer, at least in Massachusetts. However, blackmen continue to have excess mortality after a diagnosis ofprostate cancer. 13In our sample, black patients were 1.4 times as likely to have metastatic disease at diagnosis; this might account for part of the mortality gap. Further work isneeded to determine whether new screening procedures ormore judicious use of current screening procedures will helpto narrow this difference in outcomes. The widening of condence intervals after accounting for clustering suggests that whereas racial differences may besmall in the overall population, they may be larger at certainmedical centers. To the extent that certain facilities can bedemonstrated to treat different racial groups in differentways, this suggests a target for remediation. In addition, the broad categories of treatment investi- gated in this study may not tell the entire story regardingracial differences in the management of prostate cancer.Shavers et al 34have shown that black and Hispanic patients treated conservatively for prostate cancer may receive less vigilant monitoring than white patients. Therefore, evenwithin a category such as \"conservative management,\" mean-ingful racial differences may still exist. Much work remainsto be done in describing and reducing these subtler differ-ences in treatment. In conclusion, we studied non-Hispanic black and non- Hispanic white men diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostatecancer in Massachusetts during the period from 1998 to 2002.In logistic regression analyses that did not account for theclustering of outcomes, black patients were slightly lesslikely to receive aggressive therapy. However, after account-ing for the clustering of outcomes by the facility reporting the tumor, this difference was no longer statistically signicant,underscoring the importance of this maneuver. Racial differ-ences in treatment do not explain why black men continue toexperience excess mortality from prostate cancer.

The authors studied patients with uncontrolled hypertension (N =410) from 3 primary care clinics in the Veterans Affairs (VA) medical system. A questionnaire was used to assess patient adherence to therapy, and VA system phar - macy fills were used to assess the intensity of the antihypertensive regimen. At baseline, an inad-equate antihypertensive regimen was implicated as the most probable reason for uncontrolled BP in a majority of patients (72%), while nonadherence could only be implicated in 13%. In multivariate longitudinal analyses, patients who had an increase in their medical treatment during the study had lower final diastolic BP levels compared with the patients who did not (-3.70 mm Hg; P <.05). While patient adherence to therapy plays a role, vigorous clinical management by the clinician is a more important contributor to BP control. (J Clin Hypertens. 2007;9:937-943) \u00a92007 Le JacqDespite concerted efforts to improve the treat-ment of hypertension, only 64% of the hyper - tensive patients in the u nited s tates who were treated in 2003 and 2004 had controlled blood pressure ( bp ) (<140/90 mm Hg).1 There are 3 main causes of failure to control bp despite therapy: patient nonadherence, insufficient titration of ther - apy, and resistant disease. a large body of research has documented the contribution of patient non-adherence to poor control in many chronic condi-tions, including hypertension. 2-4 more recently, a growing body of literature has also documented clinician failures to escalate therapy to bring a chronic condition under control. 5-7 Hypertension is only one of many chronic conditions to be affect-ed by this failure to appropriately titrate therapy, which p hillips and colleagues8 have called \"clinical inertia.\" f inally, it has long been recognized that some patients have resistant hypertension, which is defined as a bp level that remains >139/89 mm Hg despite apparently adequate adherence and therapeutic intensity. 9,10 understanding the rela- tive contributions of these factors to uncontrolled hypertension is important for designing effective interventions to improve hypertension control; however, no previous study has addressed this issue in a primary care population. We undertook this prospective cohort study of a group of patients from the Veterans a ffairs (V a ) medical system with uncontrolled hypertension to address 2 questions. f irst, what proportion of patients with uncontrolled hypertension had poor adherence, inadequate management, or neither of these? s econd, would patient adherence and treat- ment intensity predict bp control at the end of the study? b y addressing these questions, we sought to address the relative impact of poor adherence and treatment intensity on bp control.Original Paper Understanding Uncontrolled Hypertension: Is It the Patient or the Provider?

Of these 1210, 204 (17%) were excluded from the study: 18 because their race was other than non-Hispanic white or non-Hispanic black, 41 because of impaired cognition, 59 because they denied having hypertension, 6 because they were already enrolled in another hypertension study, and 80 for miscellaneous reasons including being too ill to participate or moving or dying before they could be enrolled in the study. Of the 1006 eligible patients, 793 (79%) completed the survey, and the remainder refused to participate. r esearch associates verbally administered the questionnaire to patients and recorded the responses. Of those 793 patients, we studied only the patients whose initial bp , as recorded in the elec- tronic medical record ( emr ), was uncontrolled based on the definition in the s ixth r eport of the Joint National c ommittee on p revention, Detection, e valuation, and Treatment of High b lood p ressure (JN c V i ) guidelines (140/90 mm Hg).12 because such a small portion of our sample (1%) comprised women, we excluded them from our analyses. Thus, our final sample was composed of 410 male patients with uncontrolled bp at base- line who had completed the questionnaire. d ependent Variable: BP p atient bp values were our dependent variables. We used the bp level as recorded in the emr rather than obtaining bp using a standardized research protocol; we reasoned that this was the figure that would guide clinician decisions regarding therapy. When multiple bp measurements were taken on the same day, we used the one with the lowest systolic bp . The bp level of each patient was measured within 3 days of enrolling in the study; this con-stituted the initial bp . The study ended on a pril 21, 2004; the last bp reading obtained for each patient before this date became his outcome bp . We analyzed systolic and diastolic bp values as continuous measures of bp control. i n addition, we dichotomized all bp values into 2 categories: con- trolled and not controlled, based on whether they were >139/89 mm Hg. i f either the systolic or the diastolic bp was in excess of this goal, the bp was considered uncontrolled. While guidelines such as JN c V i and JN c 7 have called for lower bp targets in patients with diabetes and renal disease,12,13 Va clinical guidelines continued to support a formal goal of 140/90 mm Hg for all patients throughout our study period. 14 Independent Variable: AdherenceWe measured adherence using the portion of the patient questionnaire asking about issues with adherence to therapy. The 6 questions in this por - tion of the instrument (Table i ) were adapted from the work of c hoo and associates15 and m orisky4 and colleagues. s uch self-reported measures of adherence have been demonstrated to correlate with end points such as bp control in our cohort and others.4,11 among the 793 patients who completed the questionnaire, patients who endorsed at least 2 of the 6 items were significantly more likely to have uncontrolled bp at baseline (odds ratio, 1.86; P<.001). We took this to imply validity of this as a measure of patient adherence, which relates to bp control. Therefore, we classified patients as adher - ent or nonadherent with therapy based on whether they endorsed at least 2 of the 6 items. Independent Variable: t reatment Intensity There were 2 variables used to capture the concept of treatment intensity, one that we used at baseline Table I. Questions Used to Assess Adherence to Therapy 1. Some people have difficulty in taking blood pressure medication as prescribed. Do you have difficulty with this? 2. How many days in the past week did you forget to take your blood pressure medication? 3. How many days in the past week did you not take your medication on purpose? 4. How many days in the past week did you add an extra pill? 5. Did you ever take less medicine because you felt you needed less? 6. Sometimes if you feel worse when you take the medicine, do you stop taking it?

We defined adequate therapy as a regimen containing drugs from at least 3 different classes of antihypertensives, at least 1 of which had to be a loop or thiazide diuretic. i nadequate use of diuretics has been particularly identified as a com-mon reason for uncontrolled hypertension. 10,16-19 all 3 drugs had to be prescribed in at least a moderate dosage. m inimal dosages to satisfy this definition and the division of drugs into differ - ent classes were defined for all agents used in this study; the list in Table ii was discussed among sev- eral clinicians who agreed that it had validity. This definition of an adequate regimen for difficult-to-control hypertension is based on the JN c V i guidelines,12 which were current at the inception of this study and are echoed by the V a guidelines for the management of hypertension,14 both now and at the time of the study. f or the longitudinal analysis, we determined for each patient whether therapy was increased between the beginning and the end of the study. The regimen was considered to have been aug-mented if the patient was receiving an increased number of antihypertensive medications at the end of the study than the beginning or if any of the medication doses were increased during the study. Covariates We adjusted for the known predictors of bp con- trol to isolate the effects of adherence and therapy on bp . r ace was based on patient self-report and was divided into 2 groups: non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white. p atient age was recorded in the emr and was divided into 3 categories: 64 years or younger, 65 to 74 years and 75 years and older. b orzecki and colleagues20 have shown that the effect of age on the management and control of hypertension is categoric rather than linear; there-fore, we categorized age to capture this effect. The ICD-9 codes for diabetes mellitus, renal disease, and coronary artery disease were taken from the emr . b ody mass index was calculated from height and weight as recorded in the emr , and patients with a body mass index 30 were considered obese. We also adjusted for the frequency of clini-cal visits using the average number of bp values per month as a proxy measure. i n all analyses, we adjusted for the clustering of outcomes by the site of care, modeling site as a random effect. f inally, in all analyses, we adjusted for the effect of baseline bp on final bp . s tatistical Analyses We began with a cross-sectional analysis of the correlates of uncontrolled hypertension at baseline. We divided our sample into 3 groups: those whose uncontrolled hypertension at baseline could be attributed to poor adherence, inadequate manage-ment, or physiologic resistance, respectively. Our first group contained the patients reporting poor Table II.

We then divided the remaining patients into those who were receiving an adequate regimen and those who were not, according to the definition discussed earlier. b y process of elimination, patients whose bp was poorly con- trolled despite apparently adequate adherence and therapy were considered to have physiologically resistant hypertension. We then examined the predictors of final bp using the subset of patients with uncontrolled bp at baseline whose initial therapy was also inadequate and thus presented an opportunity for intensifica-tion. We used linear regressions to measure the ability of our independent variables to predict the final systolic bp and diastolic bp levels, control- ling for covariates and the site of care. We used logistic regression to measure the ability of our independent variables to predict whether the final bp would be controlled, controlling for covariates and the site of care. We performed all analyses using sas 9.1 ( sas i nstitute i nc, c ary, N c ). Res U lts There were 410 patients with baseline uncontrolled hypertension (group 1) in our study cohort (Table iii ). Of these 410 patients, 17% were on adequate regimens, while 67% were on <3 medications and 16% were on 3 medications but at inadequate doses or without the use of a diuretic. The 338 patients whose therapy was inadequate at baseline in light of their uncontrolled bp formed a second group for analysis (group 2). During the 2-year study period, 51% of the patients experienced a change in their medical regimens with an increase in medication. The average patient was followed for 438 days, with 95% of the sample having at least 221 days of data. The median patient had 12 bp values dur - ing the study; 95% of the sample had at least 5 bp values. The average age was 66.5 years, and more than half of the patients (58%) were black. The prevalence of comorbid conditions was high; only 27% of the patient population did not have at least 1 of 3 comorbidities, namely diabetes, renal disease, and coronary artery disease. a lso, 49% of the sample was obese. f ifty-two (13%) patients endorsed 2 of the adherence questions and were thus labeled as poorly adherent with their therapy. Of the adherent patients, 297 (72%) were on an inadequate regimen of antihypertensive medications considering their bp . s ixty-one patients (15%) with uncontrolled hypertension did not report poor adherence and were on an adequate regimen of medications. These patients were considered to have resistant hyperten-sion, presumably due to physiologic factors. The mean final bp level in the entire sample was 142/75 mm Hg, a marked improvement from the initial mean level of 155/80 mm Hg. When we examined the subset of patients with inadequate therapy at baseline despite their uncon-trolled hypertension (n=338), none of our inde-pendent variables significantly predicted the final systolic bp . Higher treatment intensity, however, significantly predicted a lower diastolic bp level in adjusted analyses (Table i V). c ontrolled bp (<140/90 mm Hg) was achieved in a substantial proportion of the cohort (46%) by the end of the study. i n bivariate analyses, bp control was achieved in patients with poor adher - ence 33% of the time by the end of the study, com-pared with 47% for the other patients (P=.04). i n patients with inadequate therapy at baseline, after adjustment for covariates (Table V), this result was no longer statistically significant (odds ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-1.09; P=.08). dI s CU ss I on We compared the effects of patient adherence and clinician management of hypertension on the initial Table III.

Our baseline analysis suggests that inadequate treatment intensity, or clinical inertia, is the most common reason for uncontrolled hyperten-sion (72%). i n addition, in longitudinal analyses, increased treatment intensity was associated with a lower final diastolic bp level, while the effects of adherence were not statistically significant. Only limited research has compared the rela- tive contributions of patient adherence, clinical inertia, and resistant hypertension with the failure to control the bp in hypertensive patients receiv- ing pharmacotherapy. Two case series document the experience of a single hypertension referral center. 17,21 These studies found that an inadequate medical regimen was the most common cause of uncontrolled hypertension on referral to their clinic (58%), followed by poor adherence as the second most common cause (16%); these proportions are similar to what we found. i n a smaller but intrigu- ing study, Javors and b ramble22 reviewed the care of 30 patients with various chronic conditions to investigate the relative effects of guideline-based management and patient adherence on long-term control. i n their study, bp in the majority of patients was not well controlled, and clinician failure to adhere to guideline-based management was strongly predictive of uncontrolled disease. p atient adher - ence was generally high in their sample and did not predict control of the chronic conditions. Like their study, ours suggests that vigorous clinical manage-ment may contribute more to the control of chronic conditions than patient adherence to therapy. i t is of interest to note that in a recent Harris s urvey, >90% of hypertensive patients reported that they were receiving antihypertensive therapy but, consistent with other reports, >30% did not have their medication increased despite continued elevated bp levels.23 in part, our study examined clinician adherence to JN c 6 guidelines, which were current at the time of this study, regarding bp goals and what constitutes a reasonable regimen for resistant hypertension. 12 JNc guidelines have been widely disseminated for many years, but there is some evi- dence that clinicians may not be aware of them or may not agree with all of their recommendations. i n a physician questionnaire study published in 2000, Hyman and p avlik24 showed that in contrast to the JN c 6 recommendation to intensify therapy Table IV .

Ours was a multisite study including many prac-titioners, extending the generalizability of the results. i n addition, unlike previous studies on this issue, our patients were seen in a primary care environment, the setting in which most hyperten-sion is managed. Our study also had several limitations, how- ever. f irst, we analyzed only male patients due to the predominantly male patient population in the V a system and a high percentage of patients were black. s imilarly, the V a population tends to be older and have more comorbidities than the us population, and our study is no exception. s econd, our adherence data were collected by patient report, which is a limitation although this has been shown to be a reliable measure of adher - ence. 4,15 There are other ways to measure patient adherence to medication, including medication possession ratios, which are derived from the fre-quency of pharmacy fills. r ecent reports have cast doubt on the continued validity of such measures in the V a system, however, especially because many prescriptions are refilled automatically by mail and thus are not a reflection of patient adherence. 26 Third, we used clinical bp values, rather than obtaining bp through a standardized research pro- tocol. s ince we were studying clinician behavior, however, it makes sense that we should analyze the same bp values that guided the actual decisions about whether to escalate therapy. f ourth, sample size limited our ability to detect some effects, espe-cially with regard to systolic bp . f ifth, regression to the mean, as well as secular trends of improving bp control at the V a , prob- ably accounted for some of the impressive reduc- tion in mean bp level during the study (ie, from 155/80 mm Hg to 142/75 mm Hg). The V a has incorporated bp control to <140/90 mm Hg as a performance measure during the past 5 years, and the attainment of this goal in the V a has increased during this period.25 since all patients would be equally affected by secular trends and regression artifact, however, this does not lessen the validity of our results. s ixth, many of our patients had only moderately uncontrolled bp ; the mean bp level was 155/80 mm Hg at study inception and 142/75 mm Hg at the end of the study. We might have found a dif-ferent relationship between the effects of adherence and treatment intensity on bp control in a popula- tion with more severely uncontrolled hypertension, and our results may not apply to such patients. f inally, our methods of analysis might have muted the effects of some predictors. f or example, many studies have found that patients on more vigorous regimens actually have higher bp due to confounding by indication.27 One way around this limitation is to compare observed with expected treatment intensity, as was done by b erlowitz and colleagues6 We did not have the data to pursue such a strategy. a lthough we found that any increase in the therapy was associated with a lower final diastolic bp , we might have found a more robust effect had we used methods to limit confounding by indication. Con C l U s I on s We studied a group of V a system patients with hypertension to elucidate the determinants of uncon- trolled hypertension. i nadequate medical regimens could be blamed for a majority of uncontrolled hypertension at baseline, followed by poor adher - ence by the patient as the next most common rea-son. i n longitudinal analyses, vigorous clinical man- agement also seemed to exert a greater effect than patient adherence on bp control. The key to better bp control may, in fact, lie with the clinician.

Concord Street, Suite 200, Boston, MA 02118-2644, USA. BACKGROUND: Among patients treated with warfarin patientshave more thrombotic and hemorrhagic events thanpatients without cancer. Is this also the case when cancer patients are anticoagulated for other indications? OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of warfarin, given for any indication, among patients with cancer in a community setting. METHODS: We identified patients with cancer from a larger prospective cohort of 6,761 patients from 101 clini-cal sites in the United States, matched to controls without cancer. The proportion of time spent in the therapeutic range, international normalized ration (INR) variability,and the rate of thromboembolic and major hemorrhagic events were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients undergoing treatment for cancer were matched to 283 patients withoutcancer. The cancer group spent less time in the target INR range (54 vs 66%, P<.001) and had more variable INR values (standard deviation around the mean INRvalue 1.30 vs 0.71, P<.001). There were more throm- botic events in the cancer group than in the control group (5 vs 0 events, P<.001). These analyses were repeated after excluding all of the patients anticoagu-lated for VTE; the results were unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to matched controls, cancer patients receiving warfarin spend less time in the targetINR range, have more variable INR values, and have more thrombotic events. These effects are not depen- dent on whether the patient is anticoagulated for Internal Medicine 2007;22:997 -1002 INTRODUCTION For many years, the mainstay of outpatient anticoagulation has been the oral vitamin K antagonist warfarin, a drug with anarrow therapeutic window. Patients with cancer may experi- ence especially erratic control of the international normalizedratio (INR). 1Contributing factors may include drug interac- tions, fluctuations in dietary vitamin K intake, therapy inter- ruptions, hepatic dysfunction, mucositis, and diarrhea and the hypercoagulable state induced by the cancer itself.2-10 In response to two randomized controlled trials that con- vincingly showed the superiority of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in the treatment of VTE among cancerpatients, 11-13national expert consensus panels have recom- mended the use of LMWH for patients with VTE and cancer for at least the first 3 to 6 months of long-term treatment.14,15In the study by Lee and colleagues, patients assigned to LMWH had less recurrent VTE (HR 0.48) and decreased mortality (HR 0.50), with no significant difference between groups in the rateof bleeding. 11,12However, while these studies provide high- quality evidence that LMWH is superior to warfarin in cancer patients with VTE, there is little evidence regarding the effectiveness of warfarin in cancer patients when it is used forother indications than the treatment of VTE. The goal of our study was to compare INR control and clinical outcomes between patients with and without cancer,regardless of the indication for warfarin. The Anticoagulation Consortium to Improve Outcomes Nationally (ACTION) study is a large prospective cohort study designed to assess themanagement of warfarin in community practice within theUnited States. From this cohort, we identified a population of patients undergoing active treatment for a malignancy to study the effectiveness of warfarin in this setting. METHODS The Anticoagulation Consortium to Improve Outcomes Nationally Study patients were identified from the 6,761 patients enrolled in a prospective cohort study to assess anticoagulation care in the United States, the ACTION cohort, which has beendescribed elsewhere. 16Briefly, physician practices that were registered users of CoumaCare\u00ae software (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ) were invited to participate by letterand through a study website. CoumaCare\u00ae is a softwareprogram that was freely available and used by many anti- coagulation management services for clinical purposes such as patient tracking, data entry, and record keeping. All of the 101 participating sites had at least one dedicated provider managing warfarin, usually within the setting of aReceived October 3, 2006 Revised March 6, 2007Accepted April 18, 2007Published online May 3, 2007 997community-based, physician group practice. Patients were invited to participate by letter or in person (at the time of a rou- tine appointment). To be eligible, patients had to be 18 years ofage or older and provide written informed consent. For all centers, McKessonHBOC, the data management firm, provided individual on-site training about how to recruit patients, obtainconsent, and transmit data. Adverse event reporting was mandatory and study personnel were trained to carry out such reporting in accordance with federal regulatory requirements.Enrollment began in April 2000 and ended in February 2002. Data Management Encrypted data from each site were transmitted to the data-coordinating center weekly. Data included demographic infor- mation, indication for warfarin therapy, INR target range, medical diagnoses, INR values, warfarin dose, and patientclinical management progress notes. Missing data fields and data entry errors were flagged and resolved directly with the sites by McKessonHBOC before data were transferred to thestudy investigators. Any interval of 45 days or more without INR testing or any INR value >10 or <0.8 triggered a direct query from the data coordinating center. Resolution of the flag relatingto the INR testing interval required validation of continuedwarfarin use and confirmation that the gap was not related to an adverse event. Study investigators were blinded to the identifi- cation and location of participating practices and patients. Identification and Eligibility of Case-Patients with Cancer All 102,728 progress notes of the 6,761 enrolled patients were reviewed for documented evidence of an active malignancy. To be eligible for inclusion, patients had to be actively engaged intreatment with chemotherapeutic or hormonal agents, radia- tion therapy, or palliative care. Patients whose cancer was effectively treated with surgery alone were excluded, as werepatients with an observation period of less than 30 days. We also excluded patients whose target INR range encompassed a value lower than 2.0 or higher than 3.5. The active treatment period for cancer ( \"window period \") was determined by independent review of the patient 's anticoagu- lation record by two investigators (AJR, EMH), each blinded to the INR data. INR data were censored at the time of cessationof warfarin therapy, transfer of medical care, death of the patient, or study site termination. For patients newly starting warfarin, the first 30 days of INR data were excluded tominimize the variability attributable to the initiation phase. Warfarin interruptions were quantified and divided into two categories: procedure or bleeding/missed dose. Identification of Control Patients Each case was matched to three randomly selected controlpatients without cancer. Controls were drawn from the samestudy site as the case and were matched on age within 5 years. We excluded potential controls if they had less time in the database than the corresponding case; the window period foreach control was, by definition, precisely the same number of days in length for each case and its matched controls. Patients with an INR target range encompassing values below 2.0 orabove 3.5 were also excluded. For two of the case-patients, only two eligible controls were available. For patients who were new to warfarin therapy, we excluded their INR data until theyhad been on warfarin for 30 days. Outcomes Primary outcomes included proportion of time spent in thetherapeutic range and variability in the INR measurementsduring the window period. Secondary outcomes included majorhemorrhage and thromboembolic events during the window period. Major hemorrhage was defined as a fatal event, an event requiring hospitalization with transfusion of at least two units ofpacked red blood cells or bleeding involving a critical anatomical site such as the cranium or the retroperitoneum. Statistical Analysis All analyses were performed using the SAS statistical system, version 9.1 (SAS Institute). To assess significance of effectswhen comparing categorical variables with the matched de- sign, we used Monte Carlo permutation methods with 10,000 iterations to compute empirical Pvalues. Case-control status within each \"cluster \"of matched observations was randomly permuted 10,000 times, with a test statistic (e.g., Pearson 's chi-squared statistic) calculated upon each iteration. This wasused as a reference distribution, under the null hypothesis of no association with case status, to compute the empirical Pvalue. Groups were compared on continuous variables using a generalized linear model (PROC GENMOD) to account for correlation between each case and its matched controls. We used three methods to compare INR values between the case and control groups. First, we compared the proportion ofINR measurements in the following ranges: <2, 2.0 -3.0, 3.1 - 4.0, and >4.0, using a chi-square test. Second, we used the method described by Rosendaal, et al. 17to compare the pro- portion of time spent within the INR target range. The Rosendaal method uses linear interpolation to impute INR values for days between measurements. INR values are not interpolated forgaps of greater than 56 days between measurements. A linear model was used to compare the mean proportion of time spent within the INR range between the two groups during the windowperiod, accounting for matching. We compared the variability in INR between groups during the window period, using the method described by Fihn,et al. 18,19This method calculates the standard deviation of INR measurements over time for each patient as a measure of variability. These data were log-transformed before com- parison to accommodate the distributional requirements ofthe linear model. Figure 1illustrates the concept of INR variability using the INR values of two patients from our sample; sigma is the standard deviation. We used the Monte Carlo method described above to compare the number of thromboembolic events between the two groups during the window period. In addition, we constructed a multi-variable linear regression model to investigate the determinantsof INR variability among the patients in the cancer group. Additional Analyses We recognize that the literature has already shown that the useof warfarin is problematic in cancer patients with VTE. 5,11-13998 Rose et al.: Warfarin in Cancer Patients JGIMTherefore, we were concerned that any differences between the cancer and control groups might be driven by the subset of patients anticoagulated for VTE. We addressed this concern bycreating an additional, smaller dataset, composed only of thecases anticoagulated for non-VTE indications and matched controls who were also anticoagulated for non-VTE indications. We repeated our analyses using this smaller dataset; the resultsobtained using both datasets are presented side by side for comparison. Study Approval and Funding The study protocol was approved by Western Institutional Review Board\u00ae (WIRB\u00ae) of Olympia, WA and by local reviewboards where they existed. The funding source had no role in the collection, analysis, or interpretation of the data or in the decision to submit the study for publication. RESULTS Of the 6,761 patients, 127 patients were identified as beingactively treated for cancer. Of these 127 patients, 95 met theinclusion criteria, and 32 were excluded (17 \u2014Surgery alone, 10\u2014less than 30 days of data, 3 -INR target range inappropri- ate, 2 \u2014transferred warfarin management to their oncologist). These 95 patients were matched to 283 randomly selectedcontrol patients. Of these 95 patients, 65 were anticoagulated for non-VTE indications; those 65 patients were matched to 193 control patients and were also anticoagulated for non-VTEindications to create our smaller, secondary dataset. The baseline characteristics of the case and control groups from the larger dataset are detailed in Table 1. The two groups were similar in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, target INR range, and mean weekly warfarin dose. Although there was a statistically significant difference in the total amount of follow-up time in the overall cohort per patient (10.9 vs 13.1 months),the size of this difference was small. The median window periods in the cases and controls, corresponding to the period of active cancer therapy in the case patients, were 6.4 and6.3 months long, respectively. The cancer patients were more likely than the control patients to be on warfarin due to a venous thrombotic event (31 vs 13%) and to have had moreINR measurements per patient-month during the window period (2.41 vs 1.46). In the cancer group, there were 0.16 interruptions of warfarin therapy for a procedure per patient-month, versus 0.04 in the controls ( P<.001). The majority of patients with any procedure interruptions had only one such episode: 64% in the Table 1.

Brief interruptions of warfarin therapy for minor bleeding episodes or missed doses were similar between the two groups (0.07 vs 0.05 interruptions per patient-month, P=.18). Analysis of INR Control and INR Variability Table 2shows a comparison of measures of INR control between groups. The mean INR values achieved in the two groups werenearly identical (2.54 and 2.55). However, the cancer group had greater INR variability (SD 1.31 vs 0.71, P<.001), spent propor- tionately less time in the therapeutic range (54 vs 66%, P<.001), and more time above (20 vs 15%, P=.02) and below (26 vs 19%, P<.001) the target range. These results were nearly identical when the analyses were repeated with the non-VTE dataset. In the multivariable analysis of determinants of INR vari- ability in the cancer group (Table 3), the receipt of chemother- apy and any interruption of warfarin therapy for a procedure were significantly associated with increased INR variability(2.0- and 1.4-fold increases, respectively). Older patients did not have especially high variability. The receipt of radiation therapy and hormonal therapy did not predict increased INRvariability. Interrupting warfarin therapy due to a bleedingevent, rather than for a procedure, did not predict increased INR variability. Again, these results were nearly identical when the VTE patients were excluded. Thrombotic Events and Major Bleeding Events Within the window period, 5 of the 95 patients (5.3%) in the cancer group sustained a thromboembolic event; 4 of theseoccurred among patients taking warfarin for atrial fibrillation (2 strokes and 2 pulmonary emboli) and another pulmonary embolus occurred in a patient with a prior deep venousthrombosis. For four of these patients, the event occurred during a period of warfarin interruption. No patient in the control group experienced a thromboembolism during thewindow period ( P<.001 for a difference between groups). In the non-VTE dataset, there were four thrombotic events among the cases and none among the controls ( P=.005). Three of these four events occurred during a period of warfarininterruption. Major bleeding occurred in one case-patient with VTE (subdural bleed during bridging therapy heparin). (non-VTE) was hemorrhage and was takenTable 2.

No bleeding occurred among the control patients. DISCUSSION In this community-based cohort of patients receiving warfarinfor varied indications, we found that patients with an activemalignancy spent less time in their target INR ranges, had more variable INR values, received more frequent INR testing, and experienced more thrombotic events than patients withouta malignancy. When we repeated our analyses after excluding patients anticoagulated for VTE, these results remained essentially unchanged. This suggests that the use of warfarinin cancer patients is challenging, regardless of the indication for anticoagulation. While other investigational and observational studies have investigated the treatment of VTE in cancer patients, 5,11,13,20,21 to our knowledge, none have examined the effectiveness of warfarin for non-VTE indications. In our study, 69% of cancer patients were on chronic warfarin therapy for indications otherthan VTE, and four of the five thrombotic events in the cancer group occurred in patients who were anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation. Of the five thromboembolic events in the cancergroup, four occurred during a period of warfarin interruption, which emphasizes the importance of this factor in the difficulty of managing warfarin in cancer patients. We also found an associ-ation between the receipt of chemotherapy and increased INRvariability in the cancer group, which is consistent with prior observations. 2-8,22-24 The INR control achieved among our noncancer group, 66% time-in-range, is similar to that reported for patients enrolled in randomized trials (66.4%) and anticoagulation clinics (65.5%).25Because our control patients were matched to the site of the case, the 54% time-in-range of the cancer patients further highlights the difficulties in warfarin management for this patient group. In a similar study, Palareti et al.5identified 95 patients with cancer from within a large, Italian population- based cohort study of patients receiving an oral vitamin K antagonist for treatment of VTE. The outcomes for these 95patients were compared to the outcomes of 733 patientsw i t h o u tc a n c e r .T h ei n v e s t i g a t o r sf o u n dt h a tt h ec a n c e r patients had higher rates of major bleeding (5.4 vs 0.9%) and a trend toward higher rates of thrombotic complications (6.8 vs2.5%, P=.058). In their study, cancer patients also spent a greater proportion of time above the target INR range (8.8 vs 4.5%), although this difference was not statistically significant. Some limitations of our study should be noted. Despite the robust size of the overall cohort, we only identified 95 patients with an active cancer. Our identification of case-patients wascontingent on the quality of documentation in the anti-coagulation clinical notes. However, because the diagnosis and treatment of cancer would be so germane to warfarin therapy, we feel confident that the notes would have docu-mented such information. Because signed informed consent was necessary to participate, we may have selected for a healthier group of patients. This would be expected to biastoward the null, suggesting that our findings may be an underestimate of the effect of cancer on anticoagulation.Our study has several important strengths. The omission of the first 30 days of warfarin therapy excluded a potential source of bias due to INR variability during the initiation oftherapy. The overall cohort was representative of the wide variety of patients treated with warfarin in the community. A manual review of every clinical record in the database mini-mized the likelihood of missed clinical events or assignment bias. Our study used a careful matching procedure to minimize between-group variability relating to site of care,age, and overall observation time on warfarin. Finally, ouradditional analysis, performed only among patients without VTE, excludes the possibility that the patients with VTE are driving our observed differences. Because chemotherapy is such a potent risk factor for INR fluctuation, patients and providers need to be particularly vigi- lant during these periods to minimize the variability induced byexogenous factors such as known potentiating medications. Consistent dietary intake of vitamin-K rich foods may help to offset fluctuations in INR in patients prone to erratic con-trol. 26,27Risks and benefits associated with bridging therapy during periods of warfarin interruption need to be better defined in this patient population. Newer anticoagulant drugswith a wider therapeutic index and less potential for medicationand dietary interactions will hopefully translate into improved effectiveness of anticoagulation for the prevention and treat- ment of thromboembolism among patients with malignancy. In conclusion, we found that in a community setting, cancer patients receiving warfarin for diverse indications had more erratic control of their anticoagulation than matched controlswithout cancer. They also had a significantly increased rate of thrombotic complications. Among the cancer patients, the receipt of chemotherapy was associated with increased INRvariability. When we repeated our analyses after excluding VTEpatients, these findings were essentially unchanged, suggest- ing that the difficulty of managing warfarin in cancer patients is not limited to those with VTE. Our findings extend theresults of previous studies regarding the treatment of VTE in cancer patients and suggest that warfarin may not be the optimal anticoagulant for cancer patients for any indication,especially during treatment with chemotherapy.

Addressing addiction includes intervention for riskyand problem use.Clinicians who are not addiction specialists can playimportant roles in addressing addiction. Liver Transpl 13:S59-S64, 2007. \u00a92007 AASLD. Unhealthy alcohol and drug use are associated with substantial morbidity, disability, mortality, and costs.1,2They are among the leading preventable causes of death and disability. Most cases of esopha- geal cancer, 60% of chronic pancreatitis, 50% of cirrho-sis and chronic hepatitis, 42% of acute pancreatitis, and substantial proportions of other medical illnesses including human immunodeciency virus (HIV) and in-juries are attributable to alcohol and other drugs. Morethan 100,000 people in the United States die each yearas a result of alcohol and illicit drugs. In the United States, substance (alcohol and drug) use cost far more than other common medical illnesses\u2014over $400 bil-lion a year, compared with approximately a quarter ofthat sum for coronary heart disease and an eighth of that sum for obstructive lung disease and asthma. Despite these consequences and costs, and despite the fact that over a third of hospital admissions arerelated to unhealthy alcohol and other drug use, mostsuch patients do not receive addiction treatment. But efcacious treatments exist. Tobacco addiction is more common and causes more deaths than alcohol or otherdrug use. It can be treated effectively with brief advice,individual and group counseling, and several medica-tions (nicotine replacement, bupropion, varenicline).But this review of addiction treatment focuses on alco- hol and other drug use, excluding tobacco, a topic wor-thy of separate focus. For alcohol and other drug dis- orders, behavioral and pharmacological treatments have proven efcacy. A number of these treatmentshave been proven effective relatively recently, have notyet been widely disseminated into practice, and can beimplemented outside of addiction specialty treatment settings. 3,4 Finally, unhealthy use of substances by people who have not yet met diagnostic criteria for a substance usedisorder can also be effectively treated with brief inter- ventions. These interventions are of particular impor- tance to clinicians who are not addiction specialistsbecause they are brief and can be done by nonspecial-ists. These clinicians also have critical roles in facilitat-ing receipt of addiction treatment by their patients. But before discussing specic treatments, it is impor- tant to consider the fact that addiction is a chronicdisease, so that expectations of treatment outcome areappropriate. 5Treating addiction is perhaps more like treating and managing asthma and diabetes than it is like curing a bacterial infection. ADDICTION IS A CHRONIC DISEASE Alcohol and drug (substance) dependence share a num-ber of features in common with other common chronicillnesses. 6These include the and denial. Substance dependence has a physiologic basis. For example, people with alcohol dependence, even duringabstinence, have reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid Abbreviations: HIV, human immunodeciency virus; gamma-aminobutyric Alcoholics Anonymous.

Alcohol potentiates inhibitory GABA transmission in the central nervous system. These decreases in central GABA receptors may there-fore be related to the uncontrollable desire to drink seenin people with dependence. Whether these changes area cause or effect of heavy drinking is not known. Phys-iologic characteristics that do appear to have causalroles are enzymatic activities that lead to higher levelsof serum acetaldehyde after drinking (e.g., aldehyde dehydrogenase deciency). These higher amounts of acetaldehyde that are unpleasant (e.g., nausea) are as-sociated with a lower risk for alcohol dependence. Substance dependence can be reliably diagnosed. Al- though there is no laboratory test, structured inter- views (and expert clinicians) yield diagnoses with con-sistency. These diagnoses have prognostic value interms of natural history and treatment response. Substance dependence has denable risk factors, and like other common chronic illnesses has a substan-tial genetic etiology\u2014although also similarly, there is nosingle gene responsible for the risk. Just over 50% ofalcohol dependence is related to nonshared environ- mental influences (e.g., peers, bad childhood experi- ences). The remainder is related to genetics. In adoptionstudies, having a parent with alcohol dependence dou-bles the risk. About one-third of identical twins willhave alcohol dependence if their twin has it. Epidemi- ologic studies have identied specic genes that in- crease risk. For example, genes involved in dopaminesynthesis, which is critical for the reward pathwaywhere all substances of abuse have action, increase the risk. And the gene that includes the locus that codes for alcohol dehydrogenase has been identied as a riskfactor for alcohol dependence. As with other chronic medical illnesses, treatments are effective but are often not adhered to, there are nocures, and relapse is common. Similarly, substancedependence affects physical, social, and emotionalwell-being, and requires longitudinal health care. Afteralcohol-dependence treatment, 40-60% of patients areabstinent 1 year later, and an additional 15-30% have not returned to dependent drinking. In comparison, adherence to medication regimens in diabetes, hyper-tension, and asthma are 30-50% and are generally evenworse for nonpharmacological treatments. Relapse, or recurrence of symptoms requiring additional medical care to establish remission of symptoms of these dis-eases, is actually similar to that seen in substancedependence (up to 70%). And these observations aretrue despite that fact that in practice, substance depen- dence treatment is often short term. Despite this, re- lapse rates are not 100%, as would be the case fordiabetes treated only in the short term. Last, even one of the classic characteristics of alco- holism, denial, is a common feature among patientswith other chronic illnesses like diabetes and hyperten-sion. Denial is a common response to being \"accused\" of(or diagnosed with) having an undesirable characteris-tic.In the United States, although there are addiction medicine specialists, most addiction treatment is deliv-ered in specialty treatment programs by substance abuse counselors. The view from outside this system is often that patients should go to \"detox.\" Detoxicationis useful when patients are beginning to cut down orabstain, and it is valuable as a rst step in treatment. Physical and emotional symptoms of withdrawal can be ameliorated by using medications cross-tolerant to thesubstance being used (e.g., benzodiazepines for alcoholwithdrawal). But detoxication alone (most often done in ambulatory settings) is not addiction treatment, in that it does not prevent relapse. For example, /H1102120% of patients with opioid dependence are abstinent 1 yearafter detoxication alone. Unfortunately, most patients who undergo detoxication in the United States do not receive further addiction treatment. Addiction treat-ment is aimed at decreasing the chronic consequencesof uncontrolled substance use, including physical and interpersonal consequences, and social, psychological, legal, and employment problems. In addition, treat-ment aims to reduce substance use, including lapses(usually dened as use on one occasion) and relapses(usually dened as more than one occasion of heavy use). TREATMENT What Is Addiction Treatment? Alcohol treatment includes access to psychological, medical, employment, legal, and social services, some- times removal from a drinking or otherwise harmfulenvironment, use of mutual (self)-help groups, pharma-cotherapy, and counseling by both specialists and non-specialists. This counseling includes brief counseling by physi- cians in medical settings. 7,8Of note, as would be the case for heart disease or gastrointestinal disease, a single lecture or review article such as this one cannot even briefly mention all known efcacious addictiontreatments, and certainly cannot provide detailed indi-cations, prescribing information, and counseling ingre- dients. As a result, this article focuses on principles and the best proven treatments, particularly those of rele-vance to those who are not addiction physicians orcounselors. How Effective Is Treatment? At 1 year, two-thirds of patients have a reduction inalcohol consequences (injury, unemployment) and con-sumption (by 50%). 9One-third are abstinent or drink - ing moderately without consequences. Monetary bene-ts of alcohol and drug treatment to society outweighcosts 4-12-fold (depending on drug and treatmenttype). For opioid dependence, pharmacotherapy and counseling can achieve abstinence rates of 60-80%. Principles of Treatment The National Institute on Drug Abuse has published 13principles of effective treatment. 10These are:S60 SAITZ LIVER TRANSPLANTATION.DOI 10.1002/lt. Published on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases1. No single treatment is appropriate for all individu- als. Treatments should be individualized accordingto patient needs. 2. Treatment needs to be readily available. Patients ready for treatment can be lost if treatment is not immediately accessible. 3. Effective treatment attends to multiple needs of the individual, not just his or her drug use. These needs include addressing substance use and any associated medical, psychological, social, voca-tional, and legal problems. 4. As with any chronic illness, an individual's treat- ment and services plan must be assessed continu- ally and modied as necessary to ensure that the plan meets the person's changing needs. 5. Remaining in treatment for an adequate period of time is critical for treatment effectiveness. The ap-propriate duration for an individual depends on theproblems and needs but is usually at least 3months. Treatment should include strategies tokeep patients in treatment. 6. Counseling (individual and/or group) and other be- havioral therapies are critical components of effec-tive treatment for addiction. These therapies ad- dress motivation, problem solving, relationships, social functioning, and skills useful for avoidingdrug use. 7. Medications are an important element of treatment for many patients, especially when combined withcounseling and other behavioral therapies. 8. Addicted or drug-abusing individuals with coexist- ing mental disorders should have both disorders treated in an integrated way. 9. Medical detoxication is only the rst stage of ad- diction treatment and by itself does little to change long-term drug use. 10. Treatment does not need to be voluntary to be ef- fective. Mandated treatment can increase treat- ment entry and retention. 11. Possible drug use during treatment must be mon- itored continuously, with results presented to pa- tients. Monitoring helps patients resist urges to use substances, and positive results can signal a needto intensify treatment. 12. Treatment programs should provide assessment for HIV-acquired immunodeciency syndrome, hepatitis B and C, tuberculosis, and other infec- tious diseases, and counseling to help patients modify or change behaviors that place themselves or others at risk of infection. 13. Recovery from drug addiction can be a long-term process and frequently requires multiple episodes of treatment, or long-term treatment. Behavioral Treatments Behavioral treatments for addiction with proven ef-cacy are not simply generic counseling sessions. Anumber of therapies with specic content and doses,often clearly laid out in manuals, have been proveneffective in well-designed studies. Motivational inter-viewing (or manualized 4-session motivational en- hancement therapy) is a client-centered, directivemethod for enhancing intrinsic motivation to change byexploring and resolving ambivalence. Cognitive behav-ioral therapies emphasize skills to cope with situationsthat might precipitate substance use. Twelve-step facil- itation emphasizes the disease model of addiction and encourages and facilitates full participation in 12-stepgroups like Alcoholics Anonymous. Contingency man-agement (sometimes referred to as involving motiva- tional incentives) provides rewards for treatment adher- ence or negative drug testing results. Marital and familytherapy can also be effective treatments for addiction.In the context of medication prescription for alcohol dependence, \"medical management\" by patients' physi- cians, physician assistants, or nurses, a relatively briefform of repeated counseling similar to what medicalphysicians routinely do for other medications, appears to effective. 3Medical management involves asking about medication side effects and adherence, and en- couraging abstinence. A number of other behavioral treatments have proven efcacy. These include but are not limited to the follow- ing: relapse prevention counseling, supportive-expres-sive psychotherapy, individualized drug counseling, be-havioral therapy for adolescents, multidimensionalfamily therapy for adolescents, multisystemic therapy, community reinforcement approach plus vouchers, voucher-based reinforcement therapy in methadonemaintenance treatment, day treatment with abstinencecontingencies and vouchers, and the Matrix model. Thedetails of these and other treatments are beyond the scope of this article. Pharmacological Treatments Pharmacological treatments for opioid dependence buprenorphine, andnaltrexone. 11As with other pharmacotherapies, drug use should be monitored, and patients should partici- pate in counseling and obtain any needed social sup-port. Naltrexone is a synthetic opioid antagonist that blocks the euphoria associated with opioid use. Toavoid precipitating withdrawal, it is given after an opi-ate-free period, and it is given daily or 3 times a week. Itdoes not prevent craving, and nonadherence is com- mon. This medication is best used in patients who are highly motivated to maintain abstinence (such as im-paired physicians or people on parole) who receivecounseling and careful monitoring. Methadone is a long-acting opioid agonist taken or- ally. 12,13To be effective, it must be given over a long period of time at a dose sufcient to prevent with- drawal, block effects of illicit use, and decrease craving(generally /H1135060 mg once a day). Patients stabilized on doses of methadone do not experience any euphoria from taking the drug; they feel normal and can functionnormally (or as normal as someone not receiving psy-choactive medication can feel). In the United States,methadone can only be prescribed as a treatment forTREATMENT OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG DEPENDENCE S61 LIVER TRANSPLANTATION.DOI 10.1002/lt. Published on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseasesopioid dependence by physicians in licensed metha- done maintenance programs or by physicians with spe-cic permission to prescribe it as ofce-based opioid therapy, currently an unusual exception. In these pro- grams, to which access is limited, patients tend to besubject to stigma and to inconvenient and even punitiverules, such as needing to present daily at a particulartime for dosing. Nonetheless, as part of a comprehen-sive drug treatment program, methadone treatment in-creases survival, increases treatment retention, de-creases illicit opioid use, decreases hepatitis and HIV seroconversion, decreases criminal activity, increases employment, and improves birth outcomes. As withdetoxication, /H1102280% of patients who undergo treat- ment will relapse to illicit opioid use in a year. Of note, methadone is also an excellent choice for short-term prevention of withdrawal in general hospitalsettings. The goal of methadone treatment in those set-tings is to allow the treatment of the underlying medical or surgical condition. In these cases, the dose is 20-40 mg in 24 hours, usually initially provided as 15-20 mgfollowed by an additional 5-10 mg after 2-3 hours, untilsymptoms of withdrawal abate. Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist provided sublingually for maintenance. 14With the exception of pregnant women, patients should be treated with a combination tablet of buprenorphine and naloxone.Naloxone is a short-acting opioid antagonist that is not absorbed sublingually but that prevents the tablets from being abused intravenously because it would pre-cipitate withdrawal. Buprenorphine itself can precipi-tate withdrawal, so induction involves waiting formarked withdrawal symptoms (from the abused opioid) to appear, after which buprenorphine can be initiated at a low dose, then titrated higher to the usual mainte-nance doses of 8-16 mg once daily. Buprenorphine isquite safe, in part because the opioid effect has a ceil- ing: after a certain dose, no additional effect accrues. Although experience with buprenorphine is more lim-ited than that with methadone, clinical trials havefound that buprenorphine increases abstinence fromillicit opioids, increases retention in treatment, and de- creases opioid craving and even mortality. Some pa- tients maintained on methadone can be switched tobuprenorphine. Those less likely to succeed on bu-prenorphine are those requiring higher doses of meth-adone or requiring more structured treatment pro- grams. Pharmacological treatments for alcohol dependence include disulram, acamprosate, naltrexone, and long-acting injectable naltrexone. These medications reduce and increase abstinence. Disulram, an inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenase, re- sults in increased levels of acetaldehyde and an unpleas-ant reaction after consumption of ethanol. The usual oraldaily dose is 500 mg. In one of the largest studies of this medication, disulram was no better than placebo in achieving abstinence. But it is not clear whether a place-bo-controlled trial is the best way to test a drug whoseefcacy depends largely on the patient knowing that theymay experience a very unpleasant reaction. Of note, inpost hoc analyses, the drug was more effective in those who were adherent to it. In at least 5 controlled studies, disulram was associated with marked increases in ab- stinence when administration of the drug was supervisedby a concerned other. Disulram has numerous contra-indications, and the risk-benet ratio for people at risk of complications should they experience the ethanol reac- tion (e.g., those with esophageal varices) needs to be con-sidered. High doses can lead to an idiosyncratic fulminanthepatitis and neuropathy. Acamprosate increases continuous abstinence at 1 year by 8%, from 15% to 23%, and increases abstinentdays by 27 days. 15The mechanism of action is unclear, but the drug appears to work by affecting the glutamate system. The usual oral dose is 666 mg 3 times daily. The main side effect is diarrhea, which subsides with continued use, and the medication needs adjustmentfor renal insufciency (and is contraindicated in pa-tients with renal failure). Naltrexone decreases relapse to heavy drinking by approximately 11% (decrease in absolute risk from 48% to 37%). 15Naltrexone is a long-acting opioid antagonist that is absorbed when taken orally. The usual dose is 50 mg daily. The medication blocks endogenous opi-oids, thus decreasing the reinforcing pleasurable ef- fects of drinking. The main side effects, nausea and dizziness, subside with continued use. Naltrexone can-not be given to patients with opioid dependence or aneed for opioids. In the event of an acute need foropioids to treat pain, naltrexone should be discontin- ued, and in the short term, very high doses of opioids will be required under close monitoring. Monthly injec-tions of naltrexone (380 mg intramuscularly), as estab-lished by a placebo-controlled trial, also decreases heavy drinking, and may address the problems with adherence that occur with oral pharmacotherapies thatneed to be provided daily or more frequently. 4The man - ufacturer has a program that coordinates productdelivery for all patients being treated and provides in-formation regarding appropriate storage and adminis- tration. Most studies of pharmacotherapies have been in pa- tients who have completed detoxication rst, but nal-trexone appears to be efcacious even in patients whohave a short duration of abstinence before beginning treatment. Of course, abstinence must be achieved be- fore beginning disulram to avoid the disulram-etha-nol reaction. During naltrexone or disulram treat-ment, liver enzymes should be monitored periodically. Although the drugs can cause increases in liver en- zymes, most studies of alcohol dependence pharmaco-therapy nd decreases or no difference in levels intreated patients compared with control patients. Allalcohol-dependence pharmacotherapies are category C; they should only be prescribed during pregnancy if risks will clearly outweigh benets. Combinations ofnaltrexone and acamprosate do not appear to offer clearadditional efcacy compared with either drug alone. For dependence on drugs other than alcohol, to- bacco, and opioids, there are no well-established are under investigation.S62 SAITZ LIVER TRANSPLANTATION.DOI 10.1002/lt. Published on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver DiseasesCO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS Diagnosis of co-occurring mental health problems can be challenging in people with addictions because thereis substantial overlap in symptoms, and sometimes thetemporal relations are difcult to sort out. Nonetheless,patients with co-occurring mental health conditions should have the conditions treated, regardless ofwhether the condition preceded the addiction or not. Psychiatric illness can interfere with adherence to andparticipation in addiction treatment, and it can triggerrelapse. Psychiatric treatment can decrease these ef-fects. For example, for those with anxiety disorders, buspirone can decrease heavy alcohol consumption. Fluoxetine is similarly effective in those with alcoholdependence and major depression. ADDRESSING ADDICTION What Is Risky and Problem Use? Excessive use of alcohol (e.g., /H1102214 standard drinks per week or 4 drinks per occasion by men, 7 and 3 forwomen and the elderly) and use of drugs by people who do not meet criteria for substance dependence is more common than addiction. Problem use describes peoplewho are using substances (or drinking heavily) andexperiencing consequences of that use but who do notmeet dependence criteria. People with risky use havenot yet experienced consequences but are at risk (e.g., excessive alcohol use, any illicit drug use). How Can Risky and Problem Use Be Identied? Risky and problem use should be identied because brief intervention has efcacy (proven for alcohol, some evi- dence for efcacy for drug use), and because the preva-lence is higher than that of dependence. Brief interventioncan prevent future use and can likely decrease conse- quences. Screening tests can identify risky and problemuse, and all adults should be screened. A single questioncan identify risky alcohol use: \"How many times in the past year have you had 5 (4 for women) or more drinks in a day?\" (a positive test is one or more times). Althoughscreening tests are less well validated for drug use, severalquestionnaires have been developed, and a consensuspanel recommended the following single question as ascreening test: \"Have you ever used street drugs more than 5 times in your life?\" Longer screening question- naires include the Alcohol Use Disorders IdenticationTest, a 2-item conjoint (drug and alcohol) screening test,the World Health Organization Alcohol Smoking and Sub-stance Involvement Screening Test. Laboratory tests aregenerally insensitive and nonspecic when used forscreening for unhealthy alcohol use. Laboratory testingfor drug use is similarly not very useful for screeningpatients because of short half-lives and the need to test formany drugs of abuse.Brief Intervention \"Brief intervention\" generally refers to 10-15 minutes of counseling, with feedback about use, advice, and goalsetting, and follow-up contact with a clinician. The ad- vice should be appropriate to the patient's readiness to change. Randomized trials in diverse clinical settingshave found that brief interventions can reduce riskydrinking amounts by 11%. Decreased heroin and co- caine use may result from brief intervention. 16Al- though not consistently found in controlled studies,brief intervention may also decrease consequences of alcohol and other drug use, including serum gamma- glutamyltransferase levels, hospitalization, and death. Most People With Addictions Do Not Receive Treatment Most people with addictions do not receive effective treatment. Most are not identied in medical settings.Even when patients with addictions are identied in medical settings, they often do not receive any efca- cious interventions. And even when patients enter ad-diction care via detoxication, the initial steps are mostoften not followed by efcacious addiction treatment.For example, 80% of people with opioid addiction do not receive medication-assisted treatment. Screening and Brief Intervention Clinicians who are not addiction specialists can play critical roles in improving identication and manage-ment of patients with addictions. Universal screening can identify patients with addictions. Brief interven- tions can reduce substance use and/or recommendlinkage to addictions care. Follow-up and support ofspecialty addiction treatment plans can contribute torelapse prevention efforts. 1 Referral to Mutual Help Groups Mutual or self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anony-mous (AA) provide social support and an alcohol- anddrug-free social network. Observational studies suggest that AA can increase abstinence for people with alcohol dependence who participate. Clinicians can refer pa-tients to these groups, and they can help by suggestingthat patients try groups until they nd one they arecomfortable with, and by asking about meeting atten- dance and participation. 1 Pharmacotherapy for Alcohol Dependence Clinicians who are not addiction specialists can become familiar with prescribing pharmacotherapies for alco-hol dependence, and can then do so while having ad- diction specialists manage the many other interven- tions needed for successful addiction treatment (e.g.,counseling, assistance with employment or housing). Buprenorphine Clinicians who are not addiction specialists can also be-come familiar with prescribing buprenorphine for opioidTREATMENT OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG DEPENDENCE S63 LIVER TRANSPLANTATION.DOI 10.1002/lt. Published on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseasesdependence and prescribe this treatment. In the United States, a waiver is required from the Drug EnforcementAdministration. 17,18Obtaining the waiver requires certi - cation in addiction medicine or psychiatry, or evidence oftraining (at least 8 hours) specically acceptable for this purpose. Then, as with pharmacotherapy for alcohol de-pendence, the clinician can prescribe, knowing that other aspects of addiction treatment are addressed either intheir practice or by addiction specialty clinicians or pro-grams. Prescribing this effective opioid treatment in a medical ofce represents a dramatic contrast with the requirement to attend a program to receive methadone.Buprenorphine has the potential to be more accessible topatients than methadone because it can be prescribed in a doctor's ofce. Access is currently limited in the United States by the numbers of physicians prescribing thistreatment and by a regulatory limit of 30 patients perphysician, which can be increased to 100 after the rst year. Integrating Care Clinicians who are not addiction specialists can help pa- tients receive the care that they need over time. Patientswith addictions often require coordinated, integrated care for addiction, mental health, and medical problems. These services are often delivered in different places bydifferent clinicians, in short-term programs, leading tofragmented, uncoordinated care, and increasing the riskof errors and suboptimal care. Attention to the whole clinical picture and monitoring of all of the care received (e.g., case management) can improve care. Systems thatintegrate medical, addiction, and psychiatric care havethe potential to improve patient outcomes. CONCLUSIONS To manage addictions appropriately, one must recog-nize that alcohol and other drug dependence arechronic illnesses. As such, the focus should be on long- term management with the goal of relapse prevention. Continued treatment is associated with better outcomethan short-term treatment. Behavioral treatments withproven efcacy include motivational enhancement andcognitive behavioral therapy, contingency manage- ment, less intense and less specialized medication management, and brief counseling interventions thathave efcacy specically for nondependent unhealthyalcohol use, and perhaps for initiating referral for care.Pharmacological treatments, usually in the context of counseling, also have proven efcacy. The best proven of these include acamprosate, naltrexone (oral andlong-acting injectable), and methadone and buprenorphine for opi- oid dependence. To avoid addressing only the most se- verely affected patients, attention needs to be directedto the larger proportion of patients with risky use towhom the largest number of health problems can beattributed. Care for addictions should include attentionto psychiatric comorbidity. Clinicians who are not ad-diction specialists can play very important roles in ad-dressing addiction by identifying patients with risky, problem, or dependent use; by providing brief counsel- ing and prescribing efcacious medications; by ad- dressing common comorbidities; and by referring tospecialists when needed.

Cheng, Jessica M. Richardson, Mary Jo Larson, and Jeffrey H. Samet ABSTRACT The objective of this analysis was to assess the mortality rate and risk factors in adults, with substance dependence, who are not receiving primary medical care(PC). Date and cause of death were identied using the National Death Index data anddeath certicates for 470 adults without PC over a period of almost 4 years after detailed clinical assessment after detoxication. Factors associated with risk of mortality were determined using stepwise Cox proportional hazards models. Subjectswere 76% male, 47% homeless, and 47% with chronic medical illness; 40% reported alcohol, 27% heroin, and 33% cocaine as substance of choice. Median age was 35. During a period of up to 4 years, 27 (6%) subjects died. Median age at death was 39.Causes included: poisoning by any substance (40.9% of deaths), trauma (13%), cardiovascular disease (13.6%), and exposure to cold (9.1%). The age adjusted mortality rate was 4.4 times that of the general population in the same city. Amongthese individuals without PC in a detoxication unit, risk factors associated with death were the following: drug of choice [heroin: hazard ratio (HR) 6.9 (95% condence interval (CI) 1.6-31.1]; alcohol: HR 3.7 (95% CI 0.79-16.9) compared to cocaine);past suicide attempt (HR 2.1, 95% CI 0.96-4.5); persistent homelessness (HR 2.4,95% CI 1.1-5.3); and history of any chronic medical illness (HR 2.1, 95% CI 0.93- 4.7). Receipt of primary care was not signicantly associated with death (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.34-2.1). Risk of mortality is high in patients with addictions and risk factorsidentiable when these patients seek help from the health care system (i.e., for detoxication) may help identify those at highest risk for whom interventions could be targeted. KEYWORDS Alcoholism and addictive behavior, Drug abuse, Substance abuse, Primary care, Mortality INTRODUCTION Addictive disorders are common in the United States at 3.8% for alcohol and 0.6% for drug dependence.1Many more people use alcohol and other drugs at levels that place them at risk for consequences.2A sizeable number of deaths in the United Saitz, Cheng, Richardson, and Samet are with the Clinical Addiction Research and Education Unit, Department of Medicine, Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA; Saitz, Gaeta, Cheng, Richardson, and Samet are with the Section of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA; Saitz and Richardson are with the Youth Alcohol Prevention Center, BostonUniversity School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA; Gaeta is with the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, Boston, MA, USA; Cheng is with the Department of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA; Larson is with the New England Research Institutes,Watertown, MA, USA; Samet is with the Department of Social & Behavioral Sciences, Boston UniversitySchool of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.

(E-mail: rsaitz@bu.edu) 272States are caused by alcohol (85,000) and illicit drugs (17,000) each year (4.2% of all deaths).3Alcohol and drug dependence increase the risk of death substantially.4-8 As in the general population, death in adults with substance dependence is more common in men than in women.9-11Similarly, older age is also associated with mortality in this population.10,12,13But in younger persons, there may also be high risk of death, particularly among blacks and urban residents.9,14Finally, racial and ethnic minorities with substance dependence are at higher risk of death thanmajority populations with these illnesses. 9,15,16 Much of the mortality research including people with substance dependence has focused on injection drug users, primarily of heroin.15,17,18This is likely because of the high prevalence of overdose, among other serious medical consequences, and the concomitant risk of death.4More than two-thirds of illicit drug users in an Australian study reported nonfatal drug overdose in theirlifetime, 17and a substantial proportion of the excess mortality in drug users is because of drug overdose.4 In addition to direct pharmacologic consequences, social factors may contrib- ute to excess mortality. For example, homelessness is associated with death amongsubstance users. 19,20More than half of all deaths in homeless persons in Atlanta were because of substance use.21The well-known common psychiatric comorbid- ities of homelessness are not the only explanation for increased mortality in thispopulation. In fact, Hibbs et al. found that homeless persons with substancedependence and no other mental health problems were four times more likely to diethan those with mental health problems and no substance dependence. Homelesspersons with mental health problems and no substance dependence were threetimes more likely to die than the general population. 20 As might be expected, numerous studies have identied medical illness as a predictor of death in people with substance dependence.13,22,23HIV, chronic liver disease, cardiovascular, infectious, digestive, respiratory, endocrine, metabolic, andhematological disorders contribute to these deaths. 19,23 A better understanding of predictors of death among substance-dependent persons may provide information that could help decrease the risk of mortality. Furthermore,studying those without primary medical care (common among people with substancedependence) may select for people, at particularly high risk for death, who areamenable to preventive interventions. Among people with substance dependence, barriers to receipt of care may eclipse need, leading to inadequate care and preventable illnesses. It may be particularly useful to understand these predictors among suchpersons without primary medical care who are willing to seek help from the health caresystem (i.e., via detoxication), a point at which intervention has the potential toprevent further morbidity and mortality. The main objectives of this study were to (1)describe the mortality rate and causes of death in alcohol and drug-dependent adults(without primary medical care) after detoxication and (2) identify clinical predictorsof mortality that can be recognized at the time of detoxication. METHODS Design The Health Evaluation and Linkage to Primary care (HELP) study was arandomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the effectiveness of a multidisciplinaryhealth assessment and referral to link alcohol and other drug-dependent individualsRISK OF MORTALITY DURING FOUR YEARS AFTER SUBSTANCE DETOXIFICATION IN URBAN ADULTS 273to primary care. A detailed description of the HELP study RCT was previously reported.24After providing written informed consent, eligible subjects were enrolled in the RCT. In the current study, we considered risk of mortality in the prospective follow-up of this cohort. As part of the RCT, subjects providedinformation regarding substance use, demographic, social, and health status andwere sought for follow-up interviews every 6 months for 2 years. The InstitutionalReview Board at Boston University Medical Center approved the study. Additionalprivacy protection was secured by the issuance of a Certicate of Condentiality bythe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Subjects Enrollment occurred between February 1, 1997 and April 1, 1999. Eligible subjectswere adult inpatients at a single urban residential detoxication unit, who spokeSpanish or English, reported alcohol, heroin, or cocaine as their rst or second drugof choice, and resided in proximity to the primary care clinic to which they would be referred or were homeless. Patients with primary care physicians whom they had seen within the prior 2 years; signicant dementia; plans to leave the Boston areathat would prevent research participation; failure to provide contact informationfor tracking purposes; or pregnancy were excluded. Of 642 eligible subjects, 470(73%) consented to participate and were enrolled. Data Collection Procedures Trained research associates administered standard interviews to subjects at studyentry (baseline) and follow-up interviews. The Spanish interview instrument usedthe standardized Spanish versions of scales when available. The remainder of theSpanish questionnaire was translated from the English version, back translated,checked for accuracy, and then corrected. Independent Variables Independent variables of interest were all assessed by interview at study entry. Theyincluded: age, gender, health literacy [Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine(REALM) score 25], rst language [English (yes/no)], level of education [high school graduate (yes/no)], suicide attempt (ever), drug or alcohol overdose requiring emergency department attention (ever), drug of choice (alcohol, heroin, or cocaine),addiction severity [Addiction Severity Index (ASI) alcohol and drug scales 26], alcohol or drug problems [Inventory of Drug Use Consequences (InDUC-2R)27], physical and mental health-related quality of life [the physical and mental componentsummary scores (PCS and MCS, respectively) derived from the Short Form HealthSurvey (SF-36) 28,29], depressive symptoms [Center for Epidemiologic Studies scale score30], physician diagnosed chronic medical condi- tions,31tobacco use in the past 30 days before study entry, and the following in the past 6 months before study entry: health insurance (receipt of Medicaid, Medicare,health insurance from a job or family member _s job, or any other health benets plan that paid for medical care expenses), injection drug use, past physical or sexualabuse, 32buying or selling of sex, any homelessness (one or more nights in a shelter or on the street), and persistent homelessness ( 921 days in a shelter or on the street). Receipt of primary care (yes/no) since the last research interview was assessed by aseries of detailed questions and was entered as a time-varying covariate. 33SAITZ ET AL. 274Outcome The primary outcome was time between study entry and death.

An algorithm considering the correspondence and weight of each identifying criterion is then used to classify the quality of the matches. We accepted only those matches thatt NDI-recommended quality guidelines. NDI characterized deaths by cause,which was identied by International Classication of Diseases (ICD) ninthedition codes from death certicates. The survival time was dened as the duration of time between date of study entry and date of death (for those who died). The observation time for those whodid not die was dened as the time between date of study entry and December 31, 2001, the end of the NDI search period. The Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to determine the survival probability across the mortality data collection period. City of Boston mortality rate data for years 1997-2001 were provided by the Boston Public Health Commission. We used this data as a descriptive comparisonfor the rate observed in study subjects. Analysis All analyses used SAS/STAT software, Version 8.2. 36All study subjects were eligible for analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study subjects. Age-adjusted mortality rates were estimated for both the study sample and the generalpopulation of Boston. The age adjustment was performed using the method ofdirect standardization, and the United States year 2000 population was used as thestandard for the age adjustment. For the purpose of comparison, the mortality ratesfor the current study sample and the city of Boston (calculated for the years 1997-2001) were annualized to represent a 1-year mortality rate. Given the small number of events, it was not feasible to t multivariable Cox regression models containing many predictors. Thus, we used an iterative process toselect variables for entry into a stepwise model. Preliminary unadjusted Coxproportional hazards models were used to assess the bivariable associationsbetween each of the 22 independent variables and time until death. Factors thatwere signicant at an alpha level of 0.05 were selected as candidate variables for astepwise procedure, with the exception of demographic characteristics (age, gender,and race), which were considered potential confounders, and thus, were not included in the stepwise model. The stepwise entry and removal criteria were set at aPvalue of 0.15. Correlations between independent variables were obtained, and no pair of variables had a correlation greater than 0.40. To assess potentialconfounding because of static demographic characteristics, we t an additionalmodel that included age, gender, and race with the statistically signicant variablesidentied by the stepwise procedure. Reported Pvalues are two-tailed, and a P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically signicant. RESULTS Subject Characteristics ( N= 470) Subject characteristics appear in Table 1. Of the 470 subjects, 2 died before their 6- month interview, and 400 of 468 (85%) completed at least one follow-up researchinterview; of these, 253 (63%) reported receipt of at least 1 primary care visit.SAITZ ET AL. 276Mortality and Causes of Death The 470 subjects were observed for a median (range) of 46 (1-56) months and1,728 person-years; of the 470 subjects, 27 (6%) died between 1997 and 2001. Theprobability of death by 12, 24, and 36 months was 1.7, 3.4, and 5.1%, respectively.The median age at death was 39. Twenty-four (89%) deaths were identied usingNDI data, and the remainder was identied in reports from families or friends. Cause of death data was available for 22 (82%) of the deaths. Of these 22 deaths, the most common cause of death was poisoning (41%). Of the nine deaths causedby poisoning, seven were attributed to narcotics, one to analgesics, and one wasunspecied. Trauma (one each of homicide, motor vehicle crash, and pedestrianmotor vehicle crash) and cardiovascular disease were each causes for three (14%) ofthe deaths. Exposure to cold and alcohol abuse were each the cause of two (9%)deaths. Diabetes, malignant neoplasm of lung, and intracerebral hemorrhage eachcaused one (5%) death. The age adjusted mortality rate for the study cohort was estimated as 1,608 per 100,000 people, 4.4 times that of the general population in the City of Boston (368per 100,000 people). Predictors of Risk of Death In unadjusted bivariable analyses of static demographic characteristics, race wasassociated with higher risk of mortality. The risk of death was higher for those whodescribed themselves as Hispanic [hazard ratio (HR) 4.8, 95% CI 1.6-14.96] andother race (HR 4.1, 95% CI 1.0-16.3) compared to blacks. Other race includedthose who were not white, black, or Hispanic. Age and gender were not associated with risk of mortality. In unadjusted bivariable analyses of nondemographic characteristics, alcohol and heroin as drugs of choice (compared with cocaine),persistent homelessness, suicide attempt (ever), drug or alcohol overdose requiringemergency medical attention (ever), and chronic medical illness were eachassociated with a higher risk of death (Table 1). Better physical health-related quality of life was associated with a lower risk of death. Receipt of primary carewas not signicantly associated with death (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.34-2.1). Thestepwise procedure resulted in a model that included the following nondemographic risk factors: drug of choice (heroin, alcohol, or cocaine), persistent homelessness, suicide attempt, and chronic medical illness (Table 2). In this multivariable model, heroin (HR 6.9 compared to cocaine, 95% CI 1.6-31.1) and persistent homeless-ness (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.3) were signicantly associated with an increased riskof death. To assess confounding by demographic characteristics, a subsequentTABLE 2 Risk factors for death in adults with addictions in multivariable analysis* Outcome Hazard ratio (95% CI) Pvalue Drug of choice Heroin vs. cocaine 6.9 (1.6-31.1) 0.01Alcohol vs. cocaine 3.7 (0.78-16.9) 0.09 Persistent homelessness ( Q21 nights in past 6 months) 2.4 (1.1-5.3) 0.03 Suicide attempt (ever) 2.1 (0.96-4.5) 0.06Chronic medical illness 2.1 (0.93-4.7) 0.07 *Analysis based on a stepwise Cox regression model (entry and removal criteria was set at a Pvalue of 0.15) that considered the variables listed in the table and drug overdose everRISK OF MORTALITY DURING FOUR YEARS AFTER SUBSTANCE DETOXIFICATION IN URBAN ADULTS 277regression model was t that included drug of choice, persistent homelessness (the two signicant factors from the stepwise model), and the potential confounders, age, gender, and race. In this adjusted model, heroin as drug of choice remained signicantly associated with a higher risk of death (HR 5.4 compared to cocaine,95% CI 1.1-26.5, P= 0.04), alcohol as drug of choice was not signicantly associated with risk of death (HR 3.0 compared to cocaine, 95% CI 0.6-14.9,P= 0.18), and the effect of persistent homelessness on risk of death became attenuated and of borderline statistical signicance. (HR 2.1, 95% CI 0.97-4.8,P= 0.06). Age, gender, and race were not associated with risk of mortality ( P90.15) in this adjusted model. The probability of death by the end of the follow-up period was 7.1, 1.3, and 17.5% for the substances of choice, alcohol, cocaine, and heroin, respectively; 5.9% for no persistent homelessness and 14.4% for persistenthomelessness; 5.7% for no suicide attempt and 16.8% for suicide attempt; and7.4% for no chronic medical illness and 8.1% for chronic medical illness. DISCUSSION Despite the young age of this cohort of men and women with substance dependence, most of whom were not using injection drugs, and who underwentresidential detoxication, the short-term mortality rate was high and notably higher than that in the surrounding community. Causes of death could all be related to drug or alcohol dependence. Risk factors identiable by detailed evaluation at thetime of detoxication characterized individuals at even higher risk for death,including heroin as the drug of choice and persistent homelessness. These ndingsare particularly notable because this cohort had not received primary medical care,and they were at a potential point of entry into the general health system, wherethey might have risks assessed and addressed. Furthermore, alcohol was the drug ofchoice for most subjects, thus, adding to the mortality research literature primarily focused on injection drug users. Finally, although there was limited ability to study the impact of health services on mortality, our ndings regarding receipt of primarycare suggest that such preventive services should be further studied to assess forpossible protective effects. These results expand but are consistent with literature that has reported an increased risk of mortality for people with substance dependence. 3-8While mortality rates cannot be directly compared across studies without age or sexadjustment, our results appear to be consistent with other literature reports. A prospective study of mortality among drug users after treatment showed an equally high mortality rate (1.2%), which was six times higher than that for a general, age-matched population. 37A prospective study of mortality after alcohol and drug abuse treatment showed a higher mortality of 2.38% per year, three times thatexpected in male veterans. 38Moos et al. reported that mortality in treated alcohol- dependent patients was two to ve times higher than age- and sex-matchedcomparison groups. 23The annual mortality rate for people with opioid abuse in a 12-year follow-up study was 1.4%,4and among subjects with a history of injection drug use in Scotland, the average annual mortality rate was 2.3% over a 21-year period.7These rates are all similar to the 1.7% per year rate in our study and our nding of increased mortality compared with the general population. Prior studies of substance users have reported causes of death similar to those found in this study. Poisoning, the most common cause of death reported here,SAITZ ET AL. 278increased in the US by 56% between 1991 and 2001.39While poisoning accounted for 40.9% of deaths in our study, it was the cause of 22% of the deaths in a 33-year study of heroin users.40A longitudinal intervention study of mortality after drug treatment found the same three leading causes of death: poisoning, trauma, andmedical illness. 37Heroin as primary drug of choice is a major focus in the addiction mortality literature because of the high risk of overdose and infectious diseaseassociated with its use. 4,15,17,18,40,41Homelessness is another predictor of risk of death for substance-dependent people.19-21Of note, any homelessness was not a signicant risk factor in our analyses. Only the more severe Bpersistent ^ homelessness was a signicant predictor. Our ndings also conrm that suicide attempts,42-44chronic medical illness13,22,23and alcohol as drug of choice22,45,46 are predictors of mortality in substance-dependent individuals. In this study, neither mental illness nor health literacy was associated with mortality. This observation isnot what would be expected based on prior research, 47,48and may be because of competing mortality risks in the sample. In addition, we did not assess knowledgeof overdose risk or prevention knowledge, which could have been associated withdeath. This study relied on rich detailed clinical data obtained by self-report using standardized instruments. Outcomes were ascertained using the well-described National Death Index 49-51and supplemented by reports of family and friends provided during active follow-up of the cohort. Nonetheless, several importantlimitations should be considered. First, it is possible that the death index and thesupplemental family reports missed deaths, and the number of deaths in the studywas relatively small. As a result, analyses could not consider large numbers ofvariables simultaneously, and we could not explore interactions or understandpossible effects of smaller groups (e.g., individual racial and ethnic groups). Similarly, we may not have been able to identify all predictors of mortality as a result of limited power (e.g., injection drug use, drug overdose, alcohol addictionseverity). The absence of a detectable effect of primary care is notable, although oneshould avoid drawing a conclusion of no mortality benet. Aside from powerlimitations and an inability to be condent that we captured all primary careexposures because of limitations in follow-up, we were unable to examine primarycare in adjusted analyses over a long-enough period of time to see the effects of highquality preventive and chronic care interventions. However, we were able to identify signicant predictors of risk of mortality while adjusting for basic demographic characteristics. Finally, the observational nature of the study limitedour ability to draw rm conclusions about causality. This limitation is somewhattempered by the prospective nature of the study. Substance dependence is common. 1Although tobacco use is clearly a substantial contributor to long-term mortality,52in this population of post- detoxication individuals with substance dependence (most of whom smokedcigarettes), relatively short-term mortality is so substantial that it merits consider- ation for intervention. At least some causes of death in these individuals may be preventable. We have identied characteristics that can be used to identify those atincreased risk of mortality after detoxication. Although our ndings are consistentwith the literature in this area, we add to that literature in a substantial way byreporting on this prospective cohort and by considering a range of clinicalcharacteristics assessed rst hand using standardized tools, by including a rangeof drugs of choice, and by focusing on a common characteristic in substance-dependent adults\u2014lack of regular primary medical care. Given that people whoRISK OF MORTALITY DURING FOUR YEARS AFTER SUBSTANCE DETOXIFICATION IN URBAN ADULTS 279enter detoxication often have no medical or addiction follow-up care,53-57this is an opportune moment during which people at particularly high risk can be identied and potential interventions can be developed. As the risk for death among detoxication patients overall is elevated, even among those without specic riskfactors, attention should be given as to how best to address these individuals _health needs. These ndings support arguments for better integrating detoxication andother addictions, psychiatric, and general health care.

Palfai, PhD; Debbie ScD; Naomi Freedner, MPH; Kim Dukes, PhD; Kevin Roberts, MPP; Rosanne T. Guerriero, MPH; and Jeffrey H. Samet, MD, MA, MPH Background: The efficacy of brief intervention in reducing alcohol consumption is well established for selected outpatients but not formedical inpatients. Objective: To determine whether brief intervention improves alco- hol outcomes in medical inpatients who were identified by screen-ing as having unhealthy alcohol use. Design: Randomized, controlled trial. Setting: Medical service of an urban hospital. Patients: 341 medical inpatients who were drinking risky amounts of alcohol (defined for eligibility as /H1102214 drinks/wk or /H113505 drinks/ occasion for men and for women and persons /H1135066 y); 77% had alcohol dependence as determined by the Composite International Diagnostic InterviewAlcohol Module. Intervention: A 30-minute session of motivational counseling given by trained counselors during a patient's hospitalization ( n/H11005172) versus usual care ( n/H11005169). Measurements: Self-reported primary outcomes were receipt of alcohol assistance (for example, alcohol disorders specialty treat-ment) by 3 months in dependent drinkers and change in the meannumber of drinks per day from enrollment to 12 months in allpatients.Results: The intervention was not significantly associated with re- ceipt of alcohol assistance by 3 months among alcohol-dependentpatients (adjusted proportions receiving assistance, 49% for theintervention group and 44% for the difference, 5% [95% CI, /H110028% to 19%]) or with drinks per day at 12 months among all patients (adjusted mean decreases, 1.5for patients who received the intervention and 3.1 for patients whoreceived usual care; adjusted mean group difference, /H110021.5 [CI, /H110023.7 to 0.6]). There was no significant interaction between the intervention and alcohol dependence in statistical models predictingdrinks per day ( P/H110050.24). Limitations: Baseline imbalances existed between randomized groups. Patients who received usual care were assessed and advisedthat they could discuss their drinking with their physicians. Conclusions: Brief intervention is insufficient for linking medical inpatients with treatment for alcohol dependence and for changingalcohol consumption. Medical inpatients with unhealthy alcohol userequire more extensive, tailored alcohol interventions. Ann Intern Med. 2007;146:167-176. www.annals.org For author affiliations, see end of text.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00183105. Professional organizations recommend that clinicians screen their patients for unhealthy alcohol use (that is, the spectrum from drinking risky amounts to dependence)and conduct a brief intervention when indicated (1, 2).Despite this recommendation and the existence of brief,valid screening tools (3-5), patients with unhealthy alcoholuse often are not identied and do not receive timely care. Although widely recommended, brief intervention has proven efcacy in decreasing alcohol consumption and re-lated consequences only in unhealthy drinkers without al-cohol dependence and in outpatient settings (6). Its ef-cacy among other populations (for example, persons withalcohol dependence) and in inpatient settings remains un-clear (7). Evidence suggests, however, that medical inpa- tients\u2014a group with a high prevalence of alcohol-relatedproblems\u2014may benet from brief intervention. Somestudies have demonstrated the efcacy of brief interventionin settings similar to medical services in which alcohol-related problems are common and their related conse-quences are severe (8, 9). Further, brief interventions arewell suited to medical services. Patients who otherwisemight not seek care are accessible and have time for anintervention. Persons admitted because of an alcohol-re-lated problem may recognize the link between drinking and hospitalization, thus providing a \"teachable moment\"(10). Also, busy staff might implement a brief interventionbecause of its brevity and flexibility. The unmet need for alcohol screening and interven- tion and opportunities for implementation underscore theimportance of determining the efcacy of brief interven-tion in medical inpatients with unhealthy alcohol use. Inaddition, evaluating its effectiveness and practicality inreal-world settings is critical to help clinicians make in-formed decisions when treating their patients (11). There-fore, we conducted a randomized, controlled trial to exam- See also: Print Editors' Notes .............................1 6 8 Editorial comment ..........................2 2 3 Summary for Patients .......................

We hypothesized that screening and brief in-tervention would lead to the following: receipt of alcoholassistance (for example, specialty treatment) among personswith alcohol dependence and, among all persons decreasedalcohol consumption, alcohol-related problems, and healthcare utilization and improved readiness to change andhealth-related quality of life. METHODS Patients As previously described, we recruited patients from the inpatient medical service of a large, urban teaching hospital(12). Trained research associates approached all patientswho were age 18 years or older and whose physicians didnot decline patient contact. Patients fluent in English orSpanish who gave verbal consent were asked to complete ascreening interview to determine eligibility: currently (pastmonth) drinking risky amounts (dened for eligibility for women and persons /H1135066 years); 2 contacts to assist with follow-up; no plans to move from the area in the next year; and a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 21 or greater (13, 14). Research associates assessed demographic characteris- tics and administered the Alcohol Use Disorders Identi-cation Test (AUDIT) (15) by interview. To better charac- terize current alcohol use, they assessed the averagenumbers of drinking-days per week and drinks consumedon a typical day, and the maximum number of drinksconsumed per occasion (16, 17). For the rst 7 months ofthe study, research associates asked these additional ques-tions only to patients with an AUDIT score of 8 or greater(a recommended cutoff for screening) (18). For the re-maining 22 months, research associates asked the addi-tional questions to anyone who drank in the past 12months to maximize identication of drinkers of riskyamounts. Lastly, the research associates asked all patientswho were drinking risky amounts to describe their readi-ness to change by using a visual analog scale ranging from0 to 10 (19). Enrolled patients provided written informed consent and were compensated for each completed interview. Theinstitutional review board at Boston University MedicalCenter approved this study. We secured additional privacyprotection with a certicate of condentiality from the Na-tional Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Assessment at Enrollment Research associates interviewed patients before ran- domization to assess the characteristics shown in Table 1 . One author reviewed the medical records to determinemedical diagnoses (29). Diagnoses of alcohol use disorderswere based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ofMental Disorders, Fourth Edition (30), and were deter-mined with the Composite International Diagnostic Inter-view (CIDI) Alcohol Module (31, 32). Randomization and Intervention An off-site data management group generated assign- ments to control and intervention groups by using a per-muted block (size 8) randomization procedure stratied byAUDIT the ments in sealed opaque envelopes. We used the AUDITscore to stratify because we could not score the CIDI be-fore randomization. After each baseline assessment, re-search associates opened an envelope and informed the pa-tient of his or her assignment. Patients in the control group received usual care (that is, they were told the screening results and that they coulddiscuss their drinking with their physicians). Specialistswere available by referral. Systematic alcohol screening andbrief intervention were not routine at this hospital. We assigned patients in the intervention group to a 30-minute session of brief motivational counseling (19,33) conducted by counseling and clinical psychology doc-toral students whom we trained and supervised. Sessionswere audiotaped and included feedback, an open discus-sion, and construction of a change plan ( Appendix , avail- able at www.annals.org). Outcomes and Measurements The rst primary outcome was self-reported receipt of alcohol assistance in the past 3 months by patients withContext Brief interventions reduce alcohol use in outpatients who drink unhealthy amounts but are not alcohol-dependent.Their effect in medical inpatients is unknown. Contribution The authors screened all adult medical inpatients at anurban teaching hospital and randomly assigned 341 riskydrinkers to a 30-minute motivational counseling interven-tion followed gy treatment planning or to usual care. By 3months, the same proportion of patients from both groupshad received alcohol assistance, and both groups had re-duced their drinking to the same degree. Cautions Three quarters of the participants met Diagnostic and Sta-tistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteriafor alcohol dependence. Implications In this well-done study, brief intervention did not affectalcohol-related outcomes in persons who drank unhealthyamounts. \u2014The EditorsArticle Brief Intervention for Unhealthy Alcohol Use 168 6 February 2007 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 146 \u007f Number 3 www.annals.orgCIDI-determined alcohol dependence. This outcome was measured at the 3-month follow-up visit with a standard-ized interview based on the Treatment Services Review(34) and Form 90 (35). Assistance included residentialtreatment, outpatient treatment (for example, specialtycounseling or therapy), medications, employee assistanceprograms, or mutual-help groups (for example, AlcoholicsAnonymous). The other primary outcome was the change in the number of mean drinks per day in the past 30 days fromenrollment to 12 months among all patients. We deter-mined consumption with the Timeline Follow-backmethod (36). Five secondary consumption outcomes (past 30 days) included changes from enrollment to 12 months in thenumbers of heavy drinking episodes ( /H113505 drinks/occasion for men and /H113504 drinks/occasion for women and for per- sons/H1135066 y) and days abstinent; and the proportions of patients drinking risky amounts ( /H1102214 drinks/wk or /H113504 drinks/ occasion for women and persons /H1135066 y) (37), having 1 or more heavy drinking episodes, and abstaining for all 30days. Other secondary outcomes included the changes at 12 months in readiness to change (Taking Steps scale on theStages of Change Readiness and Treatment EagernessScale) (38), alcohol problems (total score on the Short In-ventory of Problems) (39), physical and mental health-related quality of life (Physical and Mental ComponentSummary scale scores on the Short-Form Health Survey)(40), and emergency department visits and days of medicalhospitalization (both determined by a standardized inter-view based on the Treatment Services Review and Form90) (34, 35). Follow-up Procedures Research associates conducted follow-up visits, which included reassessment of most domains covered at enroll-ment, usually in person and at 3 and 12 months (10% and13%, respectively, by telephone; similar by randomizedgroup). They performed alcohol breath tests at in-personfollow-up visits (41). Although they were involved in the randomization as- signment, research associates were not involved in the in-tervention. Further, 64% of patients at 3-month follow-upand 85% of patients at 12-month follow-up were inter-viewed by a different research associate than at baseline. Statistical Analysis We analyzed all patients in the groups to which they were randomly assigned. Reported Pvalues are 2-tailed and are considered statistically signicant if they were less than0.05. We analyzed data with SAS/STAT software, versions8.2 and 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina). To describe the study sample and to compare groups, we used the chi-square test, Fisher exact test, 2-sample t test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as appropriate. For theprimary analyses, we used logistic and linear regression models to analyze dichotomous and continuous outcomes,respectively. A priori, we planned to assess for confoundingof clinically important imbalances at baseline. Regressionmodels adjusted for sex, alcohol assistance in the 3 monthsbefore enrollment, family history of alcoholism, any druguse, alcohol problem score, alcohol-attributable medical di-agnoses, and mean number of drinks per day (for dichot-omous consumption outcomes only). For the change inmean number of drinks per day at 12 months, we assessedpossible effect modication by CIDI-determined depen-dence status. We included an interaction term in regressionmodels and planned a stratied analysis if a signicant in-teraction ( P/H113490.100) was identied. Post hoc, we tested the association between patient-interventionist sex concor- dance and the primary outcomes in unadjusted logistic andlinear regression models (for dichotomous and continuousoutcomes, respectively) only in patients in the interventiongroup. We also conducted analyses using longitudinal mixed- effects models (linear for continuous outcomes and nonlin-ear for dichotomous outcomes), which included patientswho may have completed 1 follow-up visit but not theother follow-up visit. Thus, we did not exclude patientswith missing data at a single time point. We t a randomintercept model with an unstructured variance-covariancematrix. We initially planned to enroll and randomly assign 500 persons, assuming that 4% of dependent patients inthe control group would receive assistance, that all patientsin the control group consumed an average of 2.2 drinks perday, and that withdrawal rates would be 10% and 20% at3 and 12 months, respectively (42, 43). We estimated that250 persons per group would allow us to detect an absoluteincrease in assistance of 12% with 87% power and a de-crease of 0.6 drinks per day with 83% power. We repeatedpower calculations (but did not use a formal reassessmentmethod) after enrolling 300 persons because the observedvalues of the outcomes and their SDs in the control groupdiffered from those initially assumed, and withdrawal ratesat 12 months were lower than anticipated. For the recal-culations, we assumed that 40% of dependent patients inthe control group would receive assistance, that these pa-tients would consume an average of 6.3 drinks per day, andthat the withdrawal rates would be 20% and 25% at 3 and12 months, respectively. We determined that enrolling 175persons per group would allow us to detect an absoluteincrease in assistance of 19% and a decrease in drinking of2.9 drinks per day, both with 80% power. We decided toend further enrollment for the trial when we reached thenew target.

RESULTS Research associates approached 7824 persons (10 273 admissions) ( Figure ). Of 5813 patients who were screened, 986 (17%) reported drinking risky amounts of alcohol inthe past month; 341 of these patients enrolled in the study.According to screening data, these persons were signi-cantly more likely to be black (45% vs. 31%) and to drinkgreater amounts (median, 24 vs. 18 drinks/wk) than werethe 183 eligible patients who declined enrollment. Of patients who enrolled in the study, 172 were ran- domly assigned to the intervention group and 169 wererandomly assigned to the usual care group. Six patients inthe intervention group left the hospital before receiving theintervention. Over 12 months, 11 patients died and 90%(n/H11005308) of all enrolled persons completed at least 1 fol- low-up visit. According to baseline data, persons who com-pleted any follow-up were signicantly more likely to beunemployed (66% vs. 42%), have visited an emergencydepartment in the past 3 months (48% vs. 18%), and havesubstantial symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (ascore of /H1135044 on the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist [43% vs. 21%]) (27) than were those who werelost to follow-up. The randomized groups had similar characteristics at enrollment, except for sex, alcohol-attributable medical di-agnosis, receipt of alcohol assistance, and drug use ( Table 1). More than three fourths of patients had current alcohol dependence. At 12 months, 37% of 140 patients in theintervention group recalled discussing their drinking with a counselor; 28% of 145 patients in the control group re-ported such a discussion. Alcohol Assistance (Dependent Patients Only) In adjusted analyses among dependent patients ( n/H11005 204), 49% of persons in the intervention group and 44%of those in the control group received alcohol assistance by3 months (adjusted odds ratio, 1.2 [CI, 0.6 ). were also nonsigni- cant (adjusted odds ratio, 1.0 [CI, 0.4 to 2.6]; P/H110050.93) in adjusted, nonlinear mixed-effects models, as was the in-teraction between the intervention and both follow-uppoints ( P/H110050.34). In adjusted analyses among patients with AUDIT scores of 12 or greater, 48% in the interven-tion group and 43% in the control group received alcoholassistance by 3 months ( n/H11005183) (adjusted odds ratio, 1.3 [CI, 0.6 intervention-control difference, 6%[CI,/H110029% to 20%]) ( P/H110050.55).

There was a signicant adjustedmean group difference in days abstinent favoring the pa-tients in the control group. Readiness to Change, Alcohol Problems, Quality of Life, and Health Care Utilization In adjusted analyses at 12 months, the intervention did not signicantly affect readiness to change, alcohol prob-lems, physical or mental health-related quality of life, emer-gency department visits, or days hospitalized (data notshown).DISCUSSION Screening for unhealthy alcohol use and providing brief intervention did not lead to receipt of assistance foralcohol-dependent medical inpatients and had no effect onconsumption or nonconsumption outcomes among all pa-tients. The 95% CIs for the intervention versus controldifferences did not consistently include important inter-vention effects. Studies of the efcacy of brief intervention for un- healthy alcohol use in hospitalized patients have producedmixed results. Some studies of medical inpatients supportits efcacy, whereas others do not (41, 44-49). A system-atic review of controlled studies found an association be-tween brief intervention and decreased alcohol-relatedproblems but not alcohol consumption for inpatients onmedical and other hospital services (7). Studies of inpa-tients on nonmedical services, however, have more consis-tently demonstrated the efcacy of brief intervention fordecreasing alcohol consumption (9, 42, 50-52) and in-Table 2.

Various factors might explain why the intervention did not have the anticipated effects. First, medical illnesses,hospitalization, or a research assessment that could havemotivated patients contemplating change may have con-tributed to decreased alcohol consumption in both ran-domized groups. Second, we shaped the intervention toensure its feasibility and replicability; a more extensive in-tervention might produce greater effects but would proba-bly be harder to disseminate. Third, although it is uncer-tain, patients in the intervention group might have faredbetter if a medical clinician and/or a clinician they knewhad provided the intervention. Fourth, the inadequacy ofbrief intervention in dependent drinkers may not be sur-prising because its efcacy for addressing dependence hasbeen shown only in persons who seek treatment (54), un-like our patients. Our study has several notable strengths. Unlike some studies, ours was randomized and used validated screeningand diagnostic tools. We concealed randomization and an-alyzed patients in the groups to which they were random-ized regardless of receipt of intervention. We conductedscreening and brief intervention that could be reproducedin clinical practice (for example, no strict exclusion criteria,such as psychiatric illness or other drug use; pragmatic stafftraining; strategies that staff with a range of expertise couldeasily administer). We also examined the entire spectrumof unhealthy alcohol use (including dependence) in a di-verse sample. This is especially important because screen-ing in clinical practice identies the entire spectrum andrequires clinicians to address nondependent and dependentdrinking. Several methodological limitations should be consid- ered when interpreting these results. Baseline imbalancesexisted between groups despite randomization; however,we adjusted for these imbalances. The complete-case anal-ysis may be biased because we achieved 90%, not 100%,follow-up. Still, results from mixed-effects models weresimilar. Although all analyses compared patients in thegroups to which they were randomly assigned, the alcoholassistance analysis was conducted only in the subgroup ofpatients for whom it was relevant\u2014those with dependence(identied by the CIDI and not the AUDIT, which hadbeen the stratication variable). Nevertheless, an analysis ofpatients with AUDIT scores of 12 or greater yielded sim-ilar results. Research associates and patients could not be blinded; regardless, patients were generally interviewed at follow-upby a research associate whom they had not met; researchassociates would most likely have forgotten group assign-ment; and during follow-up, patients often could not cor-rectly remember the group to which they had been ran-domized. Primary outcomes were self-reported but wereassessed by trained research associates using validated, stan- dardized procedures (55). Further, biological measures arenot better than self-report for consumption outcomes, andadministrative data cannot capture the range of assistancereceived, including mutual help. We changed screening criteria early in the study, but the proportions of patients identied as drinking riskyamounts were similar with the original criteria and thechanged criteria (19% and 17%, respectively) (12). Screen-ing may not have been sensitive for nondependent un-healthy alcohol use. Still, a recent systematic review of hos-pital studies also found that 17% of inpatients had positiveresults on screening for unhealthy alcohol use (56). Pa-tients in the control group received slightly more thanusual care (assessment and notication, as part of informedconsent, that their unhealthy drinking made them eligibleand that they could discuss their drinking with their clini-cians). An assessment effect, however, would probably beminimal in these primarily non-treatment-seeking patients(54, 57). Further, many studies supporting the efcacy ofbrief intervention include a control group that providedinformed consent and had substantial assessments. Lastly,generalizability may be limited to patients seen in manylarge, urban academic hospitals. According to results from our study and others, brief intervention\u2014a currently recommended practice\u2014is inad-equate for medical inpatients with unhealthy alcohol use(primarily dependence) to link with assistance for alcoholdependence and to reduce consumption and problems. Infact, our nding that patients in the intervention grouphad a smaller increase in abstinent days is consistent withthe ndings of a previous report of the possible harms ofbrief intervention (58). Although our study does not ex-clude the possibility that medical inpatients with non-dependent unhealthy alcohol use (a small group) mightrespond to brief intervention, evidence for this benet isunclear (7). Because of the need for effective brief ap-proaches, future research should identify strategies thatstrengthen currently available interventions, such as multi-ple or booster sessions and components tailored to patients'needs. New interventions should involve staff with exper-tise in health behavior change and include all known ef-cacious therapies (for example, naltrexone or acamprosatefor dependence). Further, studies of new efforts should usemethods that separate intervention effects from the effectsof research participation. The high prevalence of unhealthy alcohol use among medical inpatients has important implications for acuteand long-term patient care. Brief interventions alone maynot be the solution. Screening hospitalized patients for un-healthy alcohol use has some value (for example, to identifydrug interactions and risk for withdrawal). Brief interven-tion in hospitals, if supplemented with discussions with aclinician over time, also may serve as a seed that later helpscatalyze change. But as a matter of policy, efforts focusedon screening and brief intervention in hospitals should be Article Brief Intervention for Unhealthy Alcohol Use 174 6 February 2007 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 146 \u007f Number 3 www.annals.orgdirected elsewhere, possibly toward more intensive inter- ventions, follow-up care, or on subgroups of patients whoare more likely to benet. Additional research must iden-tify the most effective interventions to address unhealthyalcohol use, particularly dependence, among hospitalizedpatients.

APPENDIX :DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERVENTION We assigned the patients in the intervention group to a 30-minute session of brief motivational counseling based on theprinciples of motivational interviewing (19, 32) and strategies ofmotivational enhancement therapy (59). Interventionists had 1to 6 years of clinical experience and received 2.5 days of skills-based training by motivational interviewing trainers. Interven-tionists practiced with one another and with 1 to 3 inpatientsuntil they demonstrated the required skills to the trainers. Alicensed clinical psychologist provided weekly group supervisionthat included a review of approximately 30% of patient interven-tions (that had been audiotaped) to prevent drift. Through an empathic, respectful, and collaborative inter- viewing style, interventionists aimed to increase patients' aware-ness about the risks and problems of drinking, to help patientsrecognize the discrepancy between their current alcohol use andtheir values and goals, and to enhance patients' self-efcacy forchange. Counseling sessions, which began only after interven-tionists gained the explicit permission of patients to discuss alco-hol use, included feedback, an open discussion (lasting approxi- mately 20 minutes), and construction of a change plan. Patientsreceived individualized feedback based on data from their inter-views (current alcohol consumption, Alcohol Use DisordersIdentication Test [AUDIT] scores, readiness to change, andalcohol problems) and their clinical records (alcohol-related lab-oratory results and medical diagnoses). After being told how theirdrinking compared with sex-specic national norms and abouttheir risks for harm (59), patients were invited to ask questions orto comment on the interventionist's feedback. Interventionistsresponded and followed with open-ended questions and reflectivelistening to convey empathy and to help the patients becomemore aware of how alcohol was influencing their lives. Finally,interventionists and patients generated a drinking change plan,which included anticipating obstacles and ranged from agreeingto consider changes in drinking to taking specic actions. Whena patient granted permission, interventionists shared the contentsof the session with his or her inpatient physician team and/orsocial workers. (We do not know how often this occurred).Within a week of the intervention, we mailed patients a copy ofthe change plans and a personalized letter from the intervention-ist that summarized the discussion and supported the patient'schange efforts. Postintervention Survey To determine whether the intervention was consistent with the principles of motivational interviewing, we asked the patientsto complete a survey immediately after the intervention, whichthey returned in a sealed envelope to the interventionist. (Weinformed the patients that the interventionists would not viewthe survey responses.) The survey included 12 questions thatassessed the empathy of interventionists and whether they helpedincrease self-efcacy, instilled a sense of personal responsibilityfor change, reviewed the pros and cons of drinking, and facili-tated change planning. Of the 161 patients who completed the postintervention survey, most agreed that they felt understood (88%) or cared for(87%) by the interventionist. They agreed that the intervention-ist helped them believe that they could change their drinking(85%), see the pros and cons of their drinking (79%), recognizethat changing drinking was their personal responsibility (83%),and generate a plan for their drinking (73%). Recall of the Intervention At the 12-month follow-up, we asked the patients in the intervention and control groups the following question to assesstheir recall of receiving counseling at study entry: \"As you mayrecall, everyone in this study was interviewed in the hospital forabout an hour and asked questions about their physical and men-tal health and about their drinking. After this, some people alsomet with a counselor to discuss their drinking. Did you meetwith a counselor in the hospital to discuss your drinking?\"Thirty-seven percent of 140 patients in the intervention grouprecalled discussing their drinking with a counselor; 28% of 145patients in the control group reported such a discussion.Annals of Internal Medicine W-34 6 February 2007 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 146 \u007f Number 3 www.annals.orgTypes of Alcohol Assistance Received The types of alcohol assistance received did not signicantly differ between the intervention and control groups: In unad-justed analyses of alcohol-dependent patients, 5% of patients inthe intervention group and 6% of patients in the control groupreceived residential treatment; 8% and 6%, respectively, received outpatient care; and 46% and 36%, respectively, participated in amutual-help group.

Methods: Freshmen students at one university were randomized to receive one of two types of email invitations to an online anonymous: (i) general health assessment, or (ii) alcohol-specific assessment. All were linked to the same alcohol screening survey. Those with unhealthy alcohol use (AUDIT >8) were randomly assigned to minimal or more extensive online alcohol BI. Results: In both invitation groups (4008 students), 55% of students completed the online screening. Overall, 37% of men and 26% of women had unhealthy alcohol use. Compared to mini- mal BI, more extensive BI was associated with intention to seek help among men and with a greater increase in readiness to change among women. One month after BI, 75% of students completed another assessment, 33% of women and 15% of men with unhealthy alcohol use at baseline no longer had unhealthy alcohol use. There were no significant differences on drinking measures by BI random- ization group. Conclusions: Over half of an entire freshman class of college students were reached by email and completed alcohol screening and brief intervention. Even an alcohol-specific invitation did not deter students. Although brief interventions that differed had some gender specific effects on readiness to change and intention, in general, unhealthy alcohol use decreased after brief interven- tion. Web screening and brief intervention show promise for addressing unhealthy alcohol use by college students. INTRODUCTION Unhealthy alcohol use, ranging from risky drinking through abuse and dependence, is common among college students (Hingson et al ., 2002; Wechsler et al ., 2002). Almost half (44%) of college students report one or more heavy drinking episodes in a 2 week period, while 37% meet criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence (Knight et al., 2002). Freshmen students in particular are at higher risk for heavy drinking and alcohol-related consequences, such as poisoning, injuries, and assaults (Pope, et al ., 1990; Turrisi et al ., 2000; Gruenewald et al., 2003). Alcohol screening tests to identify unhealthy use have been validated in college samples (Fleming et al., 1991; Clements, 1998; Aertgeerts et al., 2000; Kokotailo et al., 2004), and brief interventions can reduce drinking and its consequences (Marlatt et al., 1998; Baer et al., 2001; Larimer et al., 2002), but these strategies have generally not been tested using campus-wide approaches that reach large numbers of students. Fully 93% of American college students regularly use the Inter- net (Harris Interactive, 2002), and /C2425% of Internet users aged 15-24 years have looked up information about drug or alcoholproblems (The Kaiser Family Foundation, 2001). Several web- sites that assess drinking and provide normative feedback or brief intervention have been developed (Cunningham et al.,2000; Koski-Janne and Cunningham, 2001; Cloud et al ., 2001), and several sites have been designed for college studentsspecifically (Walters, 2000; Walters et al., 2000; Schroeder, 2001; Chiauzzi et al., 2005; Moore et al., 2005; Walters et al., 2005b). These sites vary in their theoretical underpinnings(e.g. health education versus brief intervention principles), length of the program, time to complete the program, and cost. Most of these sites have not yet been evaluated to determinethe relationship between these various features and efficacy. Thus, although the web may be a reasonable medium for achieving universal screening and increasing participation inbrief intervention by college students, the best approaches toimplementation remain unknown. For example, some studies have taken the approach of embedding an alcohol screening test within a general health assessment (Fleming et al ., 1997). Whether such an approach is necessary and more effi- cacious than an approach focused on alcohol screening and brief intervention remains unknown; these approaches havenot yet been compared in randomized trials. Therefore, this study aimed to compare two different recruitment strategies for universal screening and to pilot testtwo levels of online brief intervention for college students with unhealthy alcohol use. We expected to find that elec- tronic mail recruitment and web-based brief intervention forthose with unhealthy alcohol use would be a feasible strategyfor reaching freshman college students. We hypothesized that (i) an email invitation to a general-health screening would pro- duce a greater student response than an invitation to analcohol-specific screening; and (ii) a more extensive online *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed at: Boston Medical Center, 91 East Concord Street, Suite No. 200, Boston, MA 02118, USA.Tel.: +1 E-mail: rsaitz@bu.edu at Boston University Libraries on August 8, 2011 alcalc.oxfordjournals.org Downloaded from brief intervention would be more effective than a minimal brief intervention. METHODS The Institutional Review and Privacy Boards of BostonUniversity Medical Center approved this study with awaiver of consent elements and of documentation and HIPAA authorization. Eligibility and enrollment Eligible subjects were all freshman at a large urban private university in the Northeast who were >18 years and had a valid university email address. All eligible students received an introductory email from the Dean of Students on October 1, 2004. This email encour- aged students to participate, explaining that those who com- pleted the assessment survey would be eligible for a drawingto win one of twenty $50 Amazon.com gift certificates. The email also assured students that the study was anonymous and voluntary, meaning that university officials would notknow whether a student participated and would not have access to individual survey responses. The actual invitation to participate in the study, as well as a hypertext link to access the assessment survey was sent on October 4, 2004 by the university Information Technology Department, from the iHealth@bu.edu email address. The deadline for completing the assessment was October 15. Upto two email reminders were sent to non-respondents. In order to access the survey, students created a study identification code (ID) that contained no unique identifiers.To create the ID, students were prompted to enter (i) the first letter of their first name, (ii) the last letter of their last name, (iii) the last 2 digits of their university identification number,and (iv) the first and last letters of town/city where they lastattended school. Study design There were two randomizations in this study. First, freshman class email addresses were randomized (simple randomiza- tion) to receive either a general health screening invitation or an alcohol-specific invitation to participate in the study.Both the invitation emails contained a link to the same web- based alcohol assessment. Second, immediately following this assessment, all students received an online individualized 'minimal' brief intervention (BI). Students with unhealthy alcohol use\u2014that is, those with an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score of>8\u2014were subsequently randomized to receive either additional, 'more extensive' BI or no additional intervention. This second randomization was executed with stratification on AUDIT score (8-11 versus >12) and invitation group (general health versus alcohol-specific). In all cases, the brief intervention was followed by further assessment and an invitation to receive a follow-up surveyone month later. Students were told that those completing this later survey would be eligible for a drawing to win one of ten $100 Amazon.com gift certificates or a an AppleiPod/C212. Students were then provided with a list of web linksfor online resources related to all of the health behaviors askedabout in the initial assessment. One month later, students who enrolled for follow-up were sent email invitations to complete a final assessment, againdescribed as either a general health or alcohol assessment,consistent with the initial invitation randomization. Students received the same prompts to facilitate re-entry of their ID. If the ID entered at follow-up did not match a baseline ID,the ID was still accepted and the subject was permitted to com- plete the assessment. Non-responders were sent up to two reminder emails. Follow-up surveys were completed beforestudents left the university for Thanksgiving break. Assessments We incorporated validity checks into the web assessment survey and required that all items on a page be completed in order to continue. Demographics (gender, ethnicity, and race) and subjects' past month health behaviors in the follow-ing areas were assessed: aerobic activity (Godin and Shepherd, 1985), sleep habits (Wolfson et al ., 2003), smoking status, stress (Cohen et al., 1983), and alcohol use. All subjects were screened for unhealthy alcohol use by means of the AUDIT (Reinert et al., 2002). The AUDIT is a brief instrument and has been validated in at least four studies in colleges (Fleming et al., 1991; Clements, 1998; Aertgeerts et al., 2000; Kokotailo et al., 2004); it is similarly accurate when done by computer or paper and pencil.(Chan-Pensley,1999) Several AUDIT response options were modified to allowmore detailed responses with regard to consumption quantity and frequency. Three additional questions were included to determine past-month alcohol consumption (number of drinksper typical week, maximum number of drinks on one occasion, and number of heavy drinking episodes) (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2003). An AUDIT score of>8 was used as the cut-off for unhealthy alcohol use (Kokotailo et al., 2004). Subjects were then asked a single item regarding their readiness to change drinking [a 0-10visual analogue scale included the following descriptions: 0indicated 'No thought of changing'; 2 indicated 'Think I need to consider changing someday'; 5 indicated 'Think I should change, but not quite ready'; 8 indicated 'Starting to thinkabout how to change my drinking patterns'; 10 indicated 'Tak- ing action to change (e.g. cutting down)'] (Miller et al., 2002). Students with unhealthy alcohol use were asked 13 items from the Young Adult Alcohol Problem Screening Test(YAAPST) (Hurlbut et al., 1992). The items were those that (i) were not redundant with the AUDIT, and (ii) had <50% prevalence but were not rare, as indicated by surveyscompleted in 2002 and 2003 by 547 freshmen students in introductory psychology courses at the same university. Following the brief intervention there was a single item assessing help-seeking intention, three drinking age of onsetquestions (Wechsler; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2002), and an item about family history(National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2002). Readiness to change drinking was re-assessed post-BI. A single item assessed subjects' preference for obtaining person-alized information about exercise, stress, and alcohol (e.g. web versus other). The follow-up assessment included reassess- ment of the domains covered at baseline, with the exceptionof characteristics that would not change (e.g. race).SCREENING AND ONLINE BRIEF INTERVENTION FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS 29 at Boston University Libraries on August 8, 2011 alcalc.oxfordjournals.org Downloaded from Brief intervention (minimal versus more extensive) The intervention was based on elements of BASICS (Dimeff et al., 1999), motivational interviewing (Miller et al., 2002), self-change approaches (Sobell and Sobell, 1993), and feed-back about social norms (Baer et al., 1991; Agostinelli et al., 1995; Perkins et al., 1999). Normative comparisons were based on data from the previously mentioned introductory psychologystudents. Minimal BI consisted of three web screens. The firsttwo showed gender-specific graphic comparison to local norms for (i) number of drinks per typical week in the past month, and (ii) number of heavy drinking episodes in the past month(defined as >5 drinks on an occasion for men, >4 for women). The third web screen provided information about drinking guidelines, dependence symptoms, pregnancy, legal drinking age, coexisting medical conditions, and medication use. Students in the more extensive BI group received three additional web screens: (i) highest blood alcohol levelobtained in the past month and a chart describing the effectsof alcohol on cognition and behavior at different levels, (ii) a graphic profile of consequences of drinking reported in the past year, with normative information about the percent offreshmen of the same gender experiencing these consequences (see Fig. 1), and (iii) the amount of money spent per week and per year on alcohol, the number of alcohol calories consumedper month (also reported as the equivalent number of sticks ofbutter), and the amount of time required on a treadmill to burn these calories and maintain current weight. After the feedback screens, all students were shown specific drinking guidelinesand risk levels, a description of alcohol dependence symp- toms, referral information, and a page of alcohol assistance web links. All students received feedback regarding sleep,stress, physical activity, and (for smokers) smoking. Outcomes The primary outcome measure was the proportion of students completing the entire initial assessment. Outcomes immedi- ately post-intervention included readiness to change and inten- tion to seek help (for those with unhealthy alcohol use).Additional outcomes included the proportions of students who both enrolled for and completed the 1-month follow-up; the prevalence of unhealthy alcohol use at follow-up; andchanges in drinking outcomes from initial assessment to follow-up (drinks per week, heavy drinking episodes, and maximum number of drinks on a single occasion). Statistical analysis All analyses were carried out using SAS/STAT software version 8.2.(1999) Initial analyses consisted of descriptivestatistics (means, standard deviations, medians, interquartile ranges, and proportions). Comparisons were performed with two-sample t-tests for continuous variables and chi square tests for categorical variables. Reported p-values are two- tailed, with a P-value <0.05 considered statistically signifi- cant. Among students with identical IDs, changes from initial assessment to follow-up) were compared with an analysis of covariance to test for intervention and time effects. Changes over time were compared using paired t-tests in analyses stratified on gender. In a sensitivity analysis we repeatedthese analyses after adding data from subjects with gender- concordant IDs that differed by one character between initial and follow-up assessment.Sample size and statistical power The pilot trial was designed to have 90% power, using a two-tailed alpha of 0.05, to detect a difference in response rates of 50 versus 55% between the two invitation approaches. For alcohol consumption measurement outcomes, the trial wasdesigned to have 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.30 using a two-sample t-test with a two-tailed alpha at the 0.05 level. For the categorical outcome intention to seek help, there was 80% power for detecting an increase from 10 to 22%. RESULTS Subject characteristics and completion by invitation type Invitation emails were sent to 4008 freshman students (2004 in each of the two invitation conditions; Fig. 2). There were onlysix unsuccessful transmissions in each of the two invitation groups. Overall, 2,194 (54.7%) students completed the initial assessment; this included 13 assessments completed by uni-versity students who had not been invited (12 followed the general-health invitation link and one followed the alcohol- specific link [they could not be removed from the analyticsample because there was no link maintained between the data and any identifiers). There were no statistically signifi- cant differences in baseline drinking characteristics, otherhealth behaviors, or stress by invitation group (Table 1). Therewas no difference in completion rate by invitation group: 54.8% in the alcohol-specific invitation group versus 54.6% in the general health invitation group. A total of 95% of Fig. 1.

SAITZ et al. at Boston University Libraries on August 8, 2011 alcalc.oxfordjournals.org Downloaded from students who logged on to the assessment website completed the entire initial assessment. Gender and race/ethnicity were similar to that of the fresh- man class, which was 40% male, 12% Asian, 62% White,and 9% Other/Hispanic (Table 1). quarter of respondentswere abstinent (males 27% and females 25%), and half had at least one heavy drinking episode in the past 30 days (males 53% and females 51%). Many (41%) stated they would usethe web and 6% the phone to obtain personalized information about drinking. Unhealthy alcohol use: subject characteristics, randomization, and immediate outcomes About one-third of respondents ( n= 650) reported unhealthy alcohol use (AUDIT >8) (males 37% and females 26%). Of those with unhealthy alcohol use, 41% stated that they would use the web and 6% the telephone to obtain personalizedinformation regarding drinking. Among the 650 subjects with unhealthy alcohol use, there were no differences in demo- graphics or drinking characteristics between the two briefintervention groups (Table 2). Subjects with unhealthy alcoholuse reported earlier initiation of drinking. By age 14, those with unhealthy alcohol use were more likely than those with- out, to have had a first drink (20.0 versus 11.2%,P< 0.0001), to have had a drink at least once a week (1.9 ver- sus 0.53%, P< 0.007), and to have gotten drunk (9.7 versus 3.0%, P< 0.0001). Unhealthy drinkers were also significantly more likely to report a family history of alcohol problems (42.5 versus 31.8%, P< 0.0001). Immediately post-intervention during the initial assessment, 8.9% of subjects with unhealthy alcohol use indicated that they intended to seek assistance in cutting down or stopping drinking. Among men, those in the more extensive BI group were significantly more likely than those in the minimalBI group to report intentions to seek help (13 versus 5%, P= 0.016)(Table 3). Immediately post-intervention, compared Fig. 2. Participant flow through study. Table 1.

Follow-up: all subjects Of the 2194 students who completed the initial assessment, 1874 (85.4%) agreed to complete the follow-up assessment.There were no differences in agreement to follow-up bygender (males 85.2% and females 85.5%) or by invitationrandomization group (alcohol group 85.1%, general health group 85.7%). However, subjects with unhealthy alcohol use were less likely than other students to agree to follow-up(82.0 versus 86.9%, P= 0.003). Among students with unhealthy alcohol use at initial assessment, there was no dif-ference between the two brief intervention groups in agree-ment to follow-up (minimal BI 81.6%, more extensive BI 82.4%). Of the 1874 subjects who agreed to complete follow-up, 12 completed the initial assessment after the deadline and therefore were not eligible to complete the follow-up. Of the subjects who agreed and were eligible to complete follow- up, 74.6% (1389 out of 1862) completed the follow-up assess-ment (Fig. 2). At follow-up, 26.2% of subjects had unhealthy alcohol use (compared with 29.6% at baseline). Among men, a similar proportion had unhealthy alcohol use at baseline(36.6%) and follow-up (37.3%), but a smaller proportion of women at follow-up (20.3%) than at baseline (25.6%) had unhealthy alcohol use. Follow-up and 1-month outcomes: subjects with unhealthy alcohol use At follow-up, 47.4% of subjects (883/1862) provided a study ID identical to that at initial assessment, allowing data to be linked. There was no difference in the proportion of linkedsubjects between those with and without unhealthy alcoholuse (44.5 and 48.6%, respectively, P= 0.113). An additional 19.1% (355 out of 1862) had study IDs at initial assessmentand follow-up that did not differ by more than one characterTable 2.

There was no difference in pro- portion of IDs that were off by one character between subjects with and without unhealthy alcohol use (16.9 and 19.9%,respectively, P= 0.127). We examined changes over time in the 235 subjects with unhealthy alcohol who had linked initial and follow-upassessments (Table 4). There were no statistically significant differences on drinking measures by brief intervention ran- domization group. Overall, unhealthy alcohol use decreasedamong men by 15% [95% confidence interval (CI) 8-21]and among women by 33% (95% CI, 25-41). Compared to the initial assessment, female students drank less per week (mean change -1.7 drinks (SD 6.8), P= 0.005) and had fewer heavy drinking episodes (mean change -0.8 episodes (SD 3.0), P= 0.002) at follow-up. Among women, a decrease in maximum drinks per occasion (mean change -0.5 drinks (SD 3.3), P= 0.098) was not significant. Among males, there were no changes in consumption. We repeated the analyses of brief intervention outcomes including subjects who had study IDs that were identical to and that differed by one character from initial assessment. Again, there were no statistically significant differences ondrinking measures by BI randomization group. Changesfrom initial assessment to follow-up were similar to those seen in primary analyses except that for women the decrease in maximum drinks per occasion became significant (meanchange -0.72 drinks (SD 3.14), P= 0.0026). DISCUSSION In this study, a brief, web-based alcohol assessment and brief intervention reached a large proportion of students (more than half) despite participation not being required by schooladministrators, despite not providing compensation to all respondents, and despite a lack of any personal contact. One- third of these students had unhealthy alcohol use. Weemployed two approaches to inviting students to participate(general-health versus alcohol-specific email invitations). Despite concerns that students might be deterred from completing an 'alcohol' assessment, response rates for sub-jects were comparable in both groups. Similar proportions of students completed the intervention regardless of whether they had to complete a minimal or more extensive interven-tion. The more extensive brief intervention may have had greater efficacy increasing readiness to change drinking (par- ticularly in women) and intention to seek help (in men), thanminimal brief intervention. These two gender-specific resultsshould be considered hypothesis generating. And most partici- pating students completed a one-month follow-up assessment during which fewer students (more so for women) reportedunhealthy alcohol use, regardless of brief intervention (BI) group, which should also be considered a preliminary finding. Our overall findings resemble benefits identified by others of electronic (web, personal computer) brief interventions incolleges and other settings (Hester et al., 1997; Dimeff et 2000; Miller, Kypri et al ., 2004; Chiauzzi et al., 2005). Computers have been used to assist physicians with providing interventions to patients (Hester et al., 1997; Dimeff et al., 2000). Personal computer- based BIs delivered by inviting college students to present toa location on campus also have promise. Six-weeks after a BI, subjects decreased number of drinks and heavy drinking episodes (Kypri et al ., 2004). Though these decreases in consumption no longer reached significance at 6-months, reductions in alcohol consequences remained significant. In another study, a computerized BI resulted in reductions inconsumption at 3 and 6 months (Neighbors et al., 2004). In a third study, when compared to a no-treatment group, acomputer-based BI yielded alcohol consumption and conse-quence decreases similar to that of an in-person Alcohol SkillsTraining Program (ASTP) (Miller, 2001). There are few studies of the use of the web to deliver BI to students wherever they may be. In one such study,Chiauzzi et al . (2005) found that although web-BI did not appear to have an overall effect, it was beneficial for certainTable 4.

For example, persistent heavy drinkers (as compared with less persistent heavydrinkers) experienced a more rapid decrease in average and peak consumption as well as in a composite score. Women in the intervention group reported a significantly greaterreduction in alcohol-related problems. Precontemplation- stage drinkers in the intervention group reduced average con- sumption at a faster rate than those in the control group. Atleast one screening and BI website appears to have efficacy in several small controlled trials, with decreased alcohol con- sumption and alcohol-related problems in college freshmen(Henry et al ., al ., 2005; Walters et al ., 2005a). We are unable to compare the magnitude of change we observed with that of these studies, since effect sizes for those other studies have not yet been reported. Our response rate of 54% is equivalent to that reported in Marlatt et al 's study, which recruited college subjects via mailed questionnaire (1998). Although today's postal mailstudies are unlikely to duplicate such a rate, web-based research holds promise for maintaining or exceeding these rates. Our follow-up rate, at 74.6%, was similar to rates inother college web-based studies (72% at 4 weeks (Walters et al., 2005a), 80% at 6 weeks (Kypri et al., 2004), and 80% at 3 months (Chiauzzi et al., 2005)). Students with unhealthy alcohol use were less likely to be followed, but only by a small margin. Although the optimal length and components of in-person BI are not known, very brief, single contacts are less effica-cious than in-person, multi-contact BI's. (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2004) Also, most efficacious BI's have some or all of the following components: personalized norma-tive feedback, advice, and goal-setting.(U.S.Preventive Services Task Force, 2004) Adapting known efficacious in- person BI's to the web does not guarantee their continuedeffectiveness or brevity. The web-BI's with apparent efficacyconsist of relatively brief, 10-min assessments, (Chiauzzi et al., 2005) with common components including personalized normative feedback and advice (Walters et al., 2005a). In this pilot study, we compared among three web brief interventionscreens (minimal BI) and six web-BI screens (more- extensive BI); the additional screens provided feedback onhighest blood alcohol level, consequences, costs and calories. In general, minimal and more extensive intervention were similarly effective. Whether this is because both forms of theintervention were relatively minimal, because the assessment (also minimal) had effects on drinking or whether intervention length is simply not important, cannot be determined from ourdata. Clearly an even more extensive intervention includingspecific advice and change strategies might have been more effective though extending the length might also limit public health impact (by limiting the number of students who partici-pate). We also cannot determine whether specific components are essential. Therefore, further work is needed to identify optimal components and length (Del Boca et al., 2004). Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the results of this study. First, there were invitation emailsthat were not successfully sent, and responses from studentswho had not been invited to participate. However, there werevery few students in these groups. Second, we did not admin- ister extensive alcohol assessments and therefore cannot characterize alcohol diagnoses or consumption details. Ingeneral, short, validated instruments were employed to maxi-mize student participation. The readiness measure (examinedas one of the outcomes), has not been well validated though it does seem to have face validity. Third, conclusions drawn from the follow-up assessment are limited by the study design.The design maintained anonymity in order to encourage enrollment, but this made measuring changes over time possi- ble only for the sub-group of subjects who generated identicalstudy IDs at initial assessment and follow-up. However, when we included subjects in analyses with IDs that did not differ by more than one character, results were similar. Nonetheless, thevalidity of analyses of drinking changes at follow-up may bethreatened by this inability to link over half of the individual responses. However, our choice to implement an anonymous study was purposeful in that we wished to maximize the pos-sibility that a student would complete the screening and assessment, thus replicating the way colleges would most likely use alcohol screening and BI if they intended maximumparticipation. If students had not had their data recorded anonymously and/or if they had to complete written informed consent or be presented with extensive confidentiality dis-claimers (as required by the interpretation of human subjects regulations by some for such studies when done confidentially rather than anonymously) the level of participation wouldlikely have been dramatically lower. We do recognize how-ever, that web interventions could also be used by colleges for identifying students in need of assistance. A fourth poten- tial limitation is that although the reductions in drinking in thelinked sample are consistent with an effect of brief interven- tion, we cannot draw conclusions about the true efficacy of this approach without a no-intervention comparison group.And little should be made of the decrease in unhealthy use in the follow-up sample since these do not represent linked sub- jects. We did ensure that the period from initial assessment tofollow-up did not include any breaks, major holidays, or finalexams, when drinking patterns tend to show the greatest fluc- tuation (Del Boca et al., 2004). However, this design cannot substitute for an untreated control group. And the 1-month fol- low-up was short and we did not assess actual help-seeking over time, only intention to seek help; future studies should address long-term effects. Finally, the difference between theminimal and more extensive BI conditions was 3 web screens. This difference may not have been large enough to produce differences by BI group, potentially underestimating the effectof a more extensive BI. Furthermore, we cannot attribute differences in results to the difference in BI content versus length. Despite these limitations, we were able to reach a large proportion of freshman students who completed alcohol screening, brief intervention, and one-month follow-up, and the study design also allowed comparison of two levels ofintensity of brief intervention. Results also suggest that more extensive BI may have more efficacy for improving intention to seek help and readiness to change, but that even minimalBI may have decreased unhealthy alcohol use (though a secular trend cannot be excluded). A number of questions remain regarding web-based screen- ing and intervention for unhealthy alcohol use among college students. These include questions about widespread effect- iveness (particularly for impact on alcohol consequences), necessary and sufficient components of web-based brief34 R. SAITZ et al. at Boston University Libraries on August 8, 2011 alcalc.oxfordjournals.org Downloaded from interventions, duration, frequency and intensity of interven- tions, effects in important subgroups (e.g. gender), and com-parisons of costs and effectiveness with other approaches. Nonetheless, universal alcohol screening and brief interven- tion online is feasible, the approach can reach many collegestudents regardless of whether the message focuses on alcohol or general health, the feedback intervention can vary in length, and it may decrease unhealthy alcohol use. Web pages such asthose used for this study could be available free of charge without restriction and could be implemented at colleges very inexpensively. With further study, the method couldshow promise for decreasing costs and consequences associ-ated with drinking in a group of people with a high prevalence of heavy drinking and related consequences.

Samet, MD, MA, MPH,* Debbie M. Cheng, ScD,* Saitz, MD, MPH*\u00b6 Objective: To assess the relation between alcohol consumption and laboratory markers of HIV disease progression. Methods: We prospectively assessed CD4 cell counts, HIV RNA levels, and alcohol consumption for up to 7 years in 595 HIV-infected persons with alcohol problems recruited between 1997 and 2003. We investigated the relation of these markers of HIV disease progression to alcohol consumption using longitudinal regression models controlling for known prognostic factors, including adherence and depressive symptoms, and stratied by antiretroviral therapy (ART) use. Results: Among subjects who were not on ART, heavy alcohol consumption was associated with a lower CD4 cell count (adjusted mean decrease of 48.6 cells/ mL compared with abstinence; P= 0.03) but not with higher log 10HIV RNA. Among subjects who were on ART, heavy alcohol consumption was not associated with a lower CD4 cell count or higher log 10HIV RNA.Conclusions: Heavy alcohol consumption has a negative impact on the CD4 cell count in HIV-infected persons not receiving ART. In addition to the known deleterious effects of alcohol on ART adherence, these ndings suggest that avoiding heavy alcohol consumption in patients not on ART may have a benecial effect on HIV disease progression. Key Words: alcohol, CD4, HIV disease progression, HIV viral load (J Acquir Immune Dec Syndr 2007;46:194-199) Identifying modiable factors that affect HIV disease pro- gression provides opportunities to improve HIV treatment. Several such factors have been identied, including medica- tion adherence, depressive symptoms, and hepatitis C coinfection.1-3Because antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a key determinant of the clinical course of HIV disease, un- derstanding the impact of modiable factors in its presence and absence is important.4 Alcohol use is common among HIV-infected persons,5-7 and its impact on HIV disease progression has been examined in in vitro, animal, and human studies. Alcohol can adversely affect immunologic function in HIV-infected persons by various mechanisms,8including increased HIV replication in lymphocytes.9,10Research on the impact of alcohol on simian immunodeciency virus (SIV) demonstrates increased viral loads in infected rhesus monkeys given intoxicating levels of alcohol at the time of viral inoculation compared with controls that received no alcohol.11-16These data indicate that the viral set point is increased and clinical deterioration is more rapid in alcohol-exposed monkeys. In humans, the literature shows mixed effects of alcohol. Evidence from a large observational cohort of homosexual men, the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), before the advent of highly active ART, found no association between alcohol use and HIV disease progression.17We previously pub- lished cross-sectional data suggesting a negative impact of alcohol use on HIV disease progression in the era of highly active ART.18Alcohol consumption was associated with lower CD4 cell counts and higher HIV viral loads among those receiving ART. No comparable association was found for similar patients not on ART, however. In this study, we report on the impact of alcohol use among HIV-infected persons with current or past alcohol problems prospectively assessed for up to 7 years to test the following hypothesis: alcohol consumption is independently associated with more rapid HIV disease progression as measured by the CD4 cell count and HIV viral load (HIV RNA).Received for publication March 26, 2007; accepted June 14, 2007.

METHODS Study Design We analyzed the effect of alcohol consumption on CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA levels in 2 prospective cohorts of HIV-infected patients with alcohol problems. Subject Recruitment Subjects recruited between 1997 and 2003 were participants in the HIV Alcohol Longitudinal Cohort (ALC) or HIV Longitudinal Interrelationships of Viruses and Ethanol (LIVE) study. Both were prospective observational cohort studies of HIV-infected persons with current or past alcohol problems. Data were collected at study enrollment and then every 6 months from 1997 to 2001 for the HIV-ALC study and from 2001 to 2006 for the HIV-LIVE study. The recruitment sites of the HIV-ALC (n = 349) have been previously reported18and were comparable to those in the HIV-LIVE study. HIV-LIVE subjects (n = 400) were recruited from the HIV-ALC study (n = 154, 38%) and the following sites: (1) the Diagnostic Evaluation Unit,19an intake clinic for HIV-infected patients at Boston Medical Center (BMC) (n = 88, 22%); (2) HIV Primary Care and Specialty Clinics at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), Boston, MA (n = 31, 8%); and (3) other sites (n = 127, 32%), including a respite facility for homeless persons, a methadone clinic, BMC' s primary care practices, referrals by friends, newspaper advertise- ments, and posted flyers at homeless shelters and HIV/AIDS social service agencies in the Boston area. Eligibility criteria included (1) documented HIV antibody test by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELI- SA) and conrmed by Western blot (medical record or tested at enrollment), (2) afrmative responses to 2 or more CAGE alcohol screening questions7or physician investigator diag- nosis of alcohol abuse or dependence, (3) ability to speak English or Spanish, and (4) at least 1 contact person to assist with follow-up. Exclusion criteria included (1) score ,21 on the 30-item Mini-Mental State Examination,20,21(2) inability to provide informed consent or answer the interview questions, and (3) plans to move from the Boston area in the subsequent 12 months. All subjects provided written informed consent before enrollment. The Institutional Review Boards of the BMC and BIDMC approved this study. Subject Assessment Subjects received an interviewer-administered baseline assessment in English or Spanish. For the Spanish interview, standardized scales were used when available; the remainder of the questionnaire was translated from English into Spanish and back-translated. The CD4 cell count and HIV viral load were obtained at the study visit if not available by review of medical records within the past 4 months. Outcomes The primary outcomes were CD4 cell count per microliter and log 10HIV RNA copies per milliliter, which are 2 laboratory markers of HIV disease progression. Mea- surement of HIV RNA (viral load) was performed usinga branched-chain DNA (bDNA) assay or polymerase chain reaction (PCR).22The lower threshold of detection varied between 50 and 500 copies/mL over the course of the study. In analyses, undetectable HIV RNA levels were assigned half the value of the lower limit of detection. One secondary outcome, the CD4% (CD4 count/total lymphocyte count), was examined as a complementary measure of immune status that may better reflect one' s risk for opportunistic infection in the setting of hypersplenism or postsplenectomy status.23,24 Primary Independent Variable The main independent variable, alcohol consumption in the past 30 days, which was categorized as heavy, moderate, or abstinent, was assessed using a validated calendar method.25 The ''heavy'' category was derived from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism denition of amounts that risk consequences ( .14 drinks per week or $5 drinks on a single occasion for men ,66 years old and .7 drinks per week or $4 drinks on a single occasion for men $66 years old and all women).26''Moderate'' alcohol use was dened as any drinking less than heavy amounts. Potential Confounders Other variables included in regression analyses were gender; age; race (black, white, or other); HIV risk behavior (injection drug use, men having sex with men [MSM], or heterosexual sex); homelessness; 3-day adherence to ART; time since study enrollment; year of study entry; and participation in the HIV-ALC study, HIV- LIVE study, or both. Homelessness was dened as at least 1 night in a shelter or on the street in the past 6 months.27 Current ART use was assessed with the question, ''Are you currently taking antiretroviral medications for HIV?'' Three- day adherence to antiretroviral medications was determined with the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Questionnaire for Adherence to Antiretroviral Medications.28Adherence was a dichotomous variable, where patients ,100% adherent during the previous 3 days were considered not adherent. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale.29 Additional information collected to characterize subjects more completely included current and lifetime alcohol dependence (Composite International Diagnostic Interview [CIDI] Lifetime and 12 Month),30current drug dependence (CIDI 12 Month), and use of ART before study entry. Statistical Analysis Descriptive baseline statistics (proportions, means, and standard deviations) were used to characterize the study sample overall and by alcohol consumption status. Continuous variables were compared between alcohol consumption groups using analysis of variance for normally distributed variables and, otherwise, by the Kruskal-Wallis test. x2tests were used to compare categoric variables based on alcohol consumption level. We examined the relation between alcohol consumption and HIV disease progression outcomes by tting 2 separate multivariable longitudinal regression models (on and not on ART) for each of 3 outcomes (CD4 cell count, CD4%, and log10HIV RNA).

Models were stratied based on ART status, a factor previously shown to modify the effect of alcohol consumption level on HIV progression.18Subjects consistently on or not on ART contributed to that ART status, respectively. For subjects who went on or off ART during the study, we took an approach to avoid potential carryover effects from ART. If a subject went from on to off, the on observations were included but the off observations were not. If a subject went from off to on, both observations were included. Ob- servations from subjects who changed multiple times were only counted the rst time a change was made. Potential confounding factors were included in all regression models. Baseline CD4 cell count was a covariate in analyses of the CD4 outcome. Baseline CD4% was handled in a similar manner. Analyses of HIV viral load did not adjust for baseline log 10HIV RNA, because subjects with established infection had likely achieved their viral set points; thus, HIV RNA level would be expected to remain fairly constant over time. To minimize the potential for colinearity, we veried that no pair of variables included in the same regression model was highly correlated (r .0.40). All analyses were conducted using 2-sided tests and a signicance level of 0.05. Analyses were performed with the use of SAS software (version 9.1.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). RESULTS Characteristics for the cohort (n = 595) at study entry and stratied by level of alcohol consumption are listed in Table 1. The cohort included 25% women, 66% nonwhites, and 27% homeless persons, with a mean age of 41 years. Injection drug use was the HIV risk behavior in more than half of the subjects; for the remainder, the risk behavior was divided between MSM and heterosexual sex. Assessment of alcohol use in the past 30 days revealed heavy consumption in 30% of subjects and moderate consumption in 10%; 59% of subjects were abstinent. One quarter (128 of 595) of all subjects used alcohol and illicit drugs (heroin or cocaine), 19% used alcohol alone, and 15% used heroin or cocaine alone. The average daily alcohol consumption of subjects drinking in the past 30 days was 5.4 drinks. Of subjects with a history of injection drug use, 32% (114 of 354) had injected drugs in the previous 6 months. The median number of assessment time points per subject w a s9 ,a n dt h em a x i m u mw a s1 5 .T h en u m b e ro fo b s e r v a t i o n s included in the analyses for CD4 cell count was 1475 for the on ART group and 384 for the not-on-ART group (1273 and 350 respectively for the CD4% secondary outcome). The number of observations included in the analyses for HIV RNA was 1808 and 603 for the on ART group and for the not-on-ART group, respectively. The number of outcomes in the CD4 analyses was less than that in the HIV RNA analyses, because the former adjusted for baseline CD4 cell count. Thus, CD4 analyses only included outcome data from follow-up assessments. Seventy- three percent (1360 of 1859) of the CD4 test results and 71% (1710 of 2411) of the HIV RNA test results were collected within 1 month of the interview. The results of the 6 regression analyses are presented in Table 2. Among those subjects not on ART, CD4 cell countsaveraged 48.6 cells/ mL lower for those with heavy alcohol use compared with abstinence ( P= 0.03). Note that this difference does not represent change over time within individual subjects but, instead, the average difference between subjects with heavy alcohol use compared with abstinence across all time points, adjusting for baseline CD4 cell count among other covariates. There was not a signicant association, however, between heavy alcohol consumption and viral load for subjects not on ART. No association was observed for moderate drinking and any of the outcomes in the not-on-ART group. For subjects on ART, no signicant association was found for the primary outcomes at any level of alcohol consumption. Because depressive symptoms have been shown to be associated with HIV disease progression, we controlled for the CES-D score in our main analyses as a potential confounder. Because depres- sion may be in the causal pathway between alcohol and HIV disease progression, however, we t additional models without the CES-D score. In these analyses, among subjects not on ART, similar results were found (CD4 cell counts were an average of 58.4 cells/ mL lower for those with heavy alcohol use compared with abstinence; P= 0.02). Among sub- jects on ART, nonsignicantly higher log 10HIV RNA was found in those with heavy alcohol consumption compared with those who abstained (adjusted mean increase = 0.13; P= 0.09). The secondary outcome, CD4%, did not show any signicant relation with alcohol consumption in either group (in the analyses adjusted for depressive symptoms; see Table 2). DISCUSSION The ndings demonstrate a clinically and statistically signicant effect of heavy alcohol consumption on the CD4 cell count among persons not on ART. Controlling for medication adherence, this effect was not observed in those receiving ART. Previous efforts to examine this relation in HIV-infected persons have been limited by the study design (eg, cross- sectional)18or timing (eg, before the advent of highly active ART).17,31The current study prospectively examined alcohol consumption at 6-month intervals among HIV-infected persons selected on the basis of alcohol use. Use of a cohort with past or current alcohol problems was chosen, because a hypothesized modest effect of alcohol on HIV disease progression would require a relatively large study population, careful alcohol measurement, and subjects with heavier levels of alcohol consumption. Other factors, including psychosocial issues, known to be associated with HIV disease progression were measured and controlled for in the multivariable analyses to assess the independent effect of heavy or moderate alcohol consumption on markers of HIV disease progression. This study comprehensively assessed alcohol consumption using validated self-report instruments;25extended follow-up; and inclusion of multiple time-varying covariates in the regression analyses, including measures of ART adherence and de- pressive symptoms. The nding of an impact on the CD4 cell count in subjects not on ART supports the study hypothesis that alcohol consumption has a direct effect on HIV disease progression. The impact seems to be relatively modest, however, and was 196 q2007 Lippincott Williams & WilkinsSamet et al J Acquir /C15Volume tsp/joa/145820/QAI200799 Copyright \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

It may be difcult to detect a modest effect of heavy drinking on CD4 cell count among those on ART, because the large benecial effect of ART on CD4 cell count may overcome any deleterious effect of alcohol. Only 10% of the cohort reported moderate levels of alcohol consumption. Such a low prevalence of moderate alcohol use is not surprising, given the fact that most of the subjects in this cohort met criteria for lifetime alcohol dependence. Individuals with current or past alcohol de- pendence are likely to abstain or drink heavily.32The modest number of moderate drinkers in the cohort limited our ability to assess the impact of moderate alcohol consumption on HIV disease progression, however. In particular, among subjects not on ART, we are unable to conclude that there is no effectof moderate drinking because it is likely that the study was underpowered to detect effects of the observed magnitude. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the magnitude and direction of the CD4 cell count change among those on ART with moderate drinking suggest that a larger study would be unlikely to nd a detrimental effect. The mechanism of alcohol' s impact on the CD4 cell count is unclear. Attributing it to decreased medication adherence or to likelihood of receiving ARTwould not explain the nding of lower CD4 cell counts in persons not on ART. Attributing lower CD4 cell counts to a decreased likelihood of receiving ART should be adequately addressed by controlling for baseline CD4 cell count. Evidence from Bagby et al16in macaque monkeys demonstrating clinical deterioration of im- mune function in SIV-infected animals with chronic alcohol exposure suggests a more direct effect on immune function.TABLE 1.

The absence of a correlation of heavy alcohol use with HIV viral load in our study contrasts with the ndings of an increased viral set point associated with heavy drinking in these animal studies. This difference may be attributable to the fact that under experimental conditions, the monkeys were all intoxicated at the time of SIV inoculation, a scenario that was not likely the case for all subjects in this observational cohort of persons with chronic HIV infection. The absence of impact on HIV viral load among those not on ART also suggests that the decrement in CD4 cell count is not mediated by an increased viral load, which is an important determinant of the trajectory of CD4 cell count decline. Findings from this cohort raise the possibility that the effect of alcohol on the CD4 cell count is CD4 cell specic or related to the nonspecic lymphopenia associated with alcohol use.33The absence of a signicant association of alcohol consumption on CD4% suggests that the alcohol effect observed may relate to a decrease of lymphocytes overall as opposed to a selective decrement of cells. The observation that heavy alcohol consumption has an effect on the CD4 cell count in HIV-infected patients not receiving ART is in contrast to that previously described in the medical literature. One of the earliest reports on this subject was by Kaslow et al,17in which MACS participants were examined every 6 months to assess the relation between alcohol and AIDS-dening illnesses. No effect was found among the 1706 HIV-infected men; however, the level of alcohol exposure was unclear. The highest alcohol consump- tion considered was 2 or more drinks per day, and mean consumption was not described. This level of consumption contrasts with an average of 7 drinks per day in the current study' s heavy drinkers. In the analyses excluding depressive symptoms, the nding of an association of borderline signicance between heavy drinking and a modest increase of HIV viral load among subjects on ART is consistent with the ndings of Chander et al,34in which heavy alcohol consumption correlated with signicantly less viral suppression in cross-sectional analyses. These authors attributed this nding to the poorer adherence expected among heavy drinkers on ART. This is a possibility, and such an association in the current study may have beenattenuated by the inclusion of ART adherence as a covariate in the regression analysis. One limitation of this study was that we did not enroll HIV-infected persons in a cohort at the time of seroconversion (ie, an inception cohort) and follow their alcohol use, CD4 cell counts, and viral loads over time. To address this limitation, analyses controlled for baseline CD4 cell count. Lack of an inception cohort also allows the possibility that participants in the not-on-ART group may have been exposed to ART in the past but were no longer receiving it at the time of study enrollment. It is unclear how such exposure would alter the current ndings. As in any observational study, the effects of heavy alcohol use could be confounded. It is possible that we did not adequately control for all potential contributing factors to HIV disease progression. Multiple characteristics known to be associated with HIV disease progression were included as covariates in the multivariable analyses, however. Another limitation is the fact that alcohol use was assessed 30 days before the interview and CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA levels, by study design, could have been obtained up to 4 months before the interview. Most of these outcomes were within 1 month of the subject interview, however. Although alcohol consumption in HIV-infected persons is common,5,7,35heavy consumption in US cohorts is less frequent than in countries in which HIV infection and high per capita alcohol consumption coexist (eg, Russia, South Africa).36,37A modest impact of a common problem (heavy alcohol use) in patients with a prevalent disease (HIV infection) can have major public health consequences. Heavy alcohol use is a potentially modiable factor that seems to have a modest impact on HIV disease progression. Based on our ndings, we believe that HIV-infected persons who drink alcohol heavily and are not on ART might decrease their risk of disease progression if they abstain from alcohol use. There is extensive evidence of the efcacy of a brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol use in nondependent drinkers in medical settings and of the efcacy of psychosocial and pharmaco- logic treatments for alcohol dependence.38,39Although limited evidence demonstrates that intervention for alcohol problems in people with HIV is effective, its implementation among HIV-infected populations seems to be a worthwhile goal.40InTABLE 2.

BRIDDEI\\' I Drug and alcohol use complicate both the prevention and treat\u00ad ment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Substance use is one of the major engines driving HIV trans\u00ad mission, directly, through the sharingof injection drug use equip\u00ad ment and indirectly, through increasing risky sexual behaviors. Drug and alcohol dependence compromise effective HIV treat\u00ad mentby influeucing both access and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Exposure to addictive substances may have direct immunosuppressive effectsindependent of their impact on access and adherence to treatment. Measures effective at minimizing HIV transmission attributable to drug and alcohol use include HIV testing and referral to treatment, syringe and needle exchange programs, opioid replacement therapy (i.e., methadone and buprenorphine), and behavioral interventions targeting HIV risk behaviors among both HIV-infected and HIV-unin\u00ad fected people. Measures effective at optimizing HIV treatment among alcohol and drug-dependent patients include HIV testing with referral to treatment and substance use treatment that is linked to or integrated into HIV treatment. Due to the inter\u00ad twining problems of substance use and HIV infection, physi\u00ad cians and other health care providers must address the issues of illicit drugs and alcohol use as mainstream medical problems in order to provide optimal care for HIV-infected patients.

Although injection drug use most commonly implies the use of heroin, other drugs such as cocaine and methamphet\u00ad amines are parenterally administered. Globally, injec\u00ad tion drug use has been identified as a mode of HIY transmission in over 80 countries.I. 2Use of contami\u00ad nated injection drug equipment, especially needles and syringes, is estimated to account for approximately 1/3 ofnew infections outside sub-Saharan Africa. It is the major route ofmy transmission in eastern Europe and centralAsia.1, 3-5 Approximately 35% of the almost 1 million acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases reported in the United States through 2004 are attributable directly to injection drug use or to having a sex partner 6 who injects drugs. In the past two decades, the proportion ofAIDS cases by trans\u00ad mission via male to male sexual contact has decreased in the United States, while transmission via injection drug use has remained between 20-30%.7 Vol. 49-N. 2 PANMINERVA MEDICA 67 ILLICIT DRUGS, ALCOHOL, AND ADDICTION IN HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUSSAMET Injection drug use, however, is not the only sub\u00ad stance use issue associated with Hl'V-infection. Alcohol-related problems are common among HIV\u00ad infected persons.f Numerous studies have document\u00ad ed an increased prevalence ofcurrent and past problems related to alcohol among HIV-infected persons. In the United States, the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) found that among 881 veterans with HIV\u00ad infection, 36% were current \"hazardous drinkers't.? In another study of 664 patients establishing primary care for HIV-infection, 42% screened positive for a history of alcohol problems.\" In a study of 201 HIV\u00ad infected hospitalized Russian patients, only 4% (91201) had no diagnosis of alcohol or drug abuse or depen\u00ad dence, while such diagnoses were present in 9% (191201) for alcohol alone, 39% (78/201) for alcohol and drugs and 47% (95/201) for drugs alone.t? In an epidemiological surveillance study in rural Uganda, HIV-infected persons were twice as likely to report a history of alcohol consumption as compared to HN\u00ad uninfected persons.11 An understanding of the impli\u00ad cations ofdrug and alcohol use on an individual's sub\u00ad sequent clinical course is key to providing excellent HIV medical care. Human immunodeficiency virus risk behaviors and substance use Substance use can be a risk factor for HIV infec\u00ad tion by a number of different pathways in addition to the sharing ofinjection equipment. 12 It is also possible that an altered mental state due to the use ofalcohol or drugs can result in risky sexual behaviors, such as reduced condom use or increased unprotected anal intercourse. Among drug users, the use ofstimulants, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, has been linked to increased sex and drug risk behaviors in several populations.u-r> In a study by Booth et al., of over 26 000 drug users, individuals who smoked crack were more likely to have multiple sex partners and exchange sex for drugs and rnoney.te Methamphetamine use has been described among men who have sex with men and hasbeen associated with unprotected anal intercourse 17 and increased HIV seroconversion.ts Among hetero\u00ad sexual men, methamphetamine use has been associated with unprotected vaginal sex with multiple female partners, anal sex, and sex exchanged for money and drugs. Among women, methamphetamine use has been associated with both increased risky sex and drug behaviors.v- 19 A study among HIV-uninfected injec\u00ad tion drug users (IDUs) in St. Petersburg, Russia, demonstrated increased HIV seroconversion among IDUs who inject stimulants.s? Injection drug use and crack cocaine use were associated with increased HIV prevalence in a study of 1 449 drug users in Brazil.U It is hypothesized that decreased experience of pain, enhanced sexual desire, or increased confidence that sometimes occur with the use of drugs may result in an increased number of partners, prolonged duration of sexual activity, and increased tissue damage, resulting in more bodily fluid contact (i.e., blood or semen) and consequent HIV transmission.ts The relationship of alcohol and mv risk behaviors is complex and may vary by gender and age of the individual, as well as by context. In several African countries, strong associations have been demonstrat\u00ad ed between alcohol use, HIV sexual risk behaviors, and increased HIV prevalence.P In a population-based study in Botswana where the HIV prevalence is 24%, Weiser et at. found that heavy alcohol use was asso\u00ad ciated with 3 to 8 times the odds ofhaving unprotect\u00ad ed sex with a non-monogamous partner, having mul\u00ad tiple sexual partners, and paying for or selling sex in exchange for money or other resources.o Similar asso\u00ad ciations have been found among sexually-transmitted infection clinic patients in South Africa. 24 In a popu\u00ad lation-based study ofwomen in the Arusha region of Northern Tanzania, where HIV prevalence was 8.5%, the odds ofHN infection was more than 2 times high\u00ad er among women who had engaged in sexual inter\u00ad course under the influence of alcohol compared to non-drinkers.P Among female drug users, increased alcohol consumption is associated with sexual HIV risk-taking behavior.w Based on current data, address\u00ad ing alcohol problems among drug users, particularly women, may be important for reducing HIV sexual risk behaviors and possibly drug risk behaviors. Alcohol and drugs are frequently used in combina\u00ad tion with each other enhancing their disinhibiting effects and moderating their negative effects. Mixed results concerning the impact ofalcohol use on risky drug behavior have been found. 26, 27 No significant association was found between alcohol consumption and risky injection drug behavior in a study among 354drug users.26 In a cohort ofRussian rous, an asso\u00ad ciation was found between cannabis use, but not heavy alcohol use, and increased risky injection behavior.w Stein et at. found that in a cohort of IDUs with an 68 PANMINERVA MEDICA June 2007 ILLICIT DRUGS, ALCOHOL, AND ADDICTION IN HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS SAMET alcohol abuse prevalence of 28% at-risk alcohol con\u00ad sumption and alcohol abuse were associated with nee\u00ad dle sharing.27 There is a growing body of literature suggesting an association between the use ofalcohol and illicit sub\u00ad stances with HIV-risk behaviors among HIV-infect\u00ad ed persons. In the HfV Cost and Services Utilization Study (HCSUS), which included a sample of I 278 HIV-infected persons in medical care, marijuana, hard drugs, moderate alcohol use (i.e., 6-29 drinks in I month), and previous drug dependence were related to being sexually active in the past 6 months.s? Among a cohort of4016 HIV-infected men and women from 15 US cities stimulant use was associated with increased rates of unprotected vaginal or anal sex,3oA study of HIV-infected men in treatment for methamphetamine use found that using methamphetamine increased the likelihood of more unprotected intercourse with more partners than non-infected men.tt In a cohort of 345 Hl'V-infected individuals with a history of alcohol problems, 38% reported inconsistent condom use at baseline.V Among active IDUs from this cohort, at-risk drinking was also associated with inconsistent con\u00ad dom use. Thus substance use plays a fundamental role in the transmission of HIV infection in diverse popu\u00ad lations worldwide by enhancing sexual risk and the sharing ofinjection equipment. Substance use impact on human immunodeficiency virus disease clinical manifestations and progression HIV-infected IDUs do have some distinctive clini\u00ad cal characteristics. The AIDS-related opportunistic infection, tuberculosis is more common and Kaposi's sarcoma is less common among IDUS.33 In 1995-1996, the era just prior to highly active antiretroviral thera\u00ad py (HAART), no 1314non\u00ad IDUs,34 However, in the period 2000-2002, AIDS defining illnesses among IDUs increased 50% com\u00ad pared with non-IDUs.34 Since 1996, several studies have demonstrated a smaller mortality improvement in patients infected with HIV from injection drug use compared to other transmission factors.35-37 Comorbidities, such as chronic psychiatric disor\u00ad ders and hepatitis C, are more common among IDUs,33 It is well established that psychiatric conditions, such as depression, anxiety, and severe mental illness, are prevalent among substance using HIV-infected individuals.w >? Both HIV-infected and uninfected women who inject drugs may be at higher risk for depressive symptoms. 40, 41 The relationship between mental health disorders, substance abuse, and HIV manifests in a number of ways, including increased high risk sex and drug practices, more rapid HIV dis\u00ad ease progression, and decreasing use of HAART. 38.40, 42-44 The impact of substance use on HIV disease pro\u00ad gression may be related to receipt of and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) was well as direct consequences of the substances on immune function and other clinical outcomes, Investigators have exam\u00ad ined the relationship of active substance use and HIV disease progression and mortality. In a longitudinal study of Hl'V-infected clinic patients, Lucas et al. found that subjects who persistently or intermittent\u00ad ly used drugs had increased mortality compared to subjects who were non-drug users.e> Of the subjects classified as intermittent drug users, those with recent active use had rates of HIV disease progression sim\u00ad ilar to those with persistent drug use, whereas those in a period of abstinence had HIV disease progression rates similar to those who never used drugs. In a 6-site longitudinal study of Hl'V-infected women, Kapadia et al. reported that women who consistently used non-injection drugs were at higher risk for progressing to AIDS than women who had never used non-injec\u00ad tion drugs.46Among 595 HIV-infected patients with alcohol problems, Walley et al. found a 2.4 times increased hazard for 6-month mortality for patients with recent heroin or cocaine use after adjustment for age, CD4 cell count, ART use, homelessness, and alcohol use.s? Several reasons may explain why active substance users with HIV infection may have worse mortali\u00ad ty and health outcomes. HIV-infected people with alcohol and drug use delay presentation to medical care after learning about an HIV diagnosis and start treatment later in their disease course.s>- 48, 49 In some countries substance users experience increased bar\u00ad riers to accessing health care, including poverty, lackofinsurance, andstigmatization. 50-52Adherence to ART may be more difficult for these patients because of the competing daily struggles to cope with an addiction or find housing. 53-61Overdose and injury contribute to increased mortality among drug users.62. 63 VoI.49-N.2 PANMINERVA MEDICA 69 SAMET ILLICIT DRUGS, ALCOHOL, AND ADDICTION IN HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS The role of alcohol in mv disease progression has been examined. Alcohol use may affect mortality through increasing susceptibility to injury, pneumonia, suicide, and liver disease.e-- 65 The direct toxic effects ofalcohol and other drugs may lead to further immuno\u00ad suppression and HIV disease progression.ss- 59, 61, 66 Alcohol use is associated with liver disease and may have a direct effect on the immune system, resulting in HIV disease progression.et- 67, 68 In the era before HAART, there was no association found between alco\u00ad hol and HIV progression.e? In the HAART era, an association between heavy alcohol consumption and HIV disease progression was found.?? Among those not receiving ART, heavy alcohol use was associated with a mean decrement in CD4 cell count ofapproximate\u00ad ly 50 cells/mm! compared to non-drinkers. There was no impact of heavy alcohol use on HIV disease pro\u00ad gression among those receiving ART. Thus, there is some evidence that heavy drinking in those not on ART may have a deleterious effect on HIV disease progression. Physicians' attitudes may be a barrier to HIV care, particularly when patients are substance users. In the HCSUS Study, negative attitudes by physicians toward treating HIV infected IDUs were common (23%),71 Factors associated with more positive physician atti\u00ad tudes were seeing more mus, having more mv treat\u00ad ment knowledge, and treating fewer patients per week. ReceiptofARTwasrelatedto theseattitudes. Whereas 14% ofIDUs with a physician with negative attitudes toward substance users receive ART, 32% of IDUs with physicians with positive attitudes received ART. This compares to ART receipt in 36% of patients of non-IDU patients who had a physician with negative attitudes. Substance use and antiretroviral therapy adherence Should antiretroviral therapy be initiated in sub\u00ad stance users who are actively using drugs or alcohol? Several studies have demonstrated that injection drug use, cocaine use, and heavy drinking worsen ART adherence. A 12-month study among HIV-infected former and current heroin users found that cocaine use was the most important predictor of non-adher\u00ad ence.53 Cocaine users were 27% adherent compared to 68% adherent for non-users. Consistent with these findings, 13% of cocaine users maintained viral sup\u00ad pression over a 6-month follow-up compared to 46% for non-users. Similarly, Hinkin et at. found that active stimulant use was associated with lower adherence.I? Two other studies found decreased ART adherence among current drug users and alcohol users, but no decrease in adherence in patients with past drug use only.55, 56 A cohort study of578 Hl'V-mfected persons first prescribed ART between 1996-2000 classified drug users as current IDUs, former IDUs, and non\u00ad drug users.st The current IDUs were less likely to suppress their HIV RNA to <500 copies/mL com\u00ad pared to non-drug users (adjusted odds 0.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13-0.67). Former IDUs were not less likely to achieve HIV suppres\u00ad sion compared to non-drug users. Lucas et at. studied transitions between abstinence and substance use in substance-dependent HIV-infected persons.>? Becoming abstinent was associated with better ART adherence, improved virologic control, and higher CD4 cell count; resuming use was associated with worse adherence, poorer virologic control, and decreased CD4 cell count. Alcohol use has also been shown to negatively impact medication adherence. In a 1990's survey of212 HIV-infected persons from two outpatient clinics, problem drinkers were significantly more likely to report taking medications off schedule (45% versus 26%; P=0.02),73 Reasons for missing medications included forgetting, running out of medications, and consuming alcohol or drugs. More recently, alcohol use was found to be associated with decreased ART adher\u00ad ence and decreased use ofART.54. 74. 75 However, some studies have shown that some active drug users can successfully take medications.te Techniques, such as directly observed therapy, may provide the additional support active drugs users need to maintain adherence to their medication regimen.\". 78 Among patients with a history of drug or alcohol dependence, but currently in recovery, ART should be considered in the same manner as a patient without a history of substance abuse.r? While adherence may be compromised in patients with active alcohol or drug abuse or dependence, clinicians should weigh the risks and benefits of starting ART on a case by case basis in each individual patient.w Patient-specif\u00ad ic factors, such as the patient's personal adherence history, availability of social and adherence support, motivation to engage in treatment, CD4 cell count, viral load, history of opportunistic infections, and the resistance profile of the patient's virus, should all be considered in making this decision. PANMINERVA MEDICA June 2007 70 ILLICIT DRUGS, ALCOHOL, AND ADDICTION IN HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS SAMET Human immunodeficiency virus prevention, human immunodeficiency virus medical care, and substance abuse treatment HIV seroprevalence among IDUs varies greatly depending on the local prevalence of drug use, the level of awareness of HIV risk in the community, and the availability of HIV prevention programs. Needle exchange programs One ofthe best documented prevention strategies for HIV infection among substance users is needle exchange programs. Comprehensive reviews of the scientific literature reveal substantial evidence that needle exchange programs decrease risky behavior and HIV seroconversion among IDUs and are cost\u00ad effective.u- 82 In one evaluation, a randomized con\u00ad trolled trial compared needle exchange programs with improved access to syringes from pharmacies.s' Needle exchange programs were not associated with an increase in injection drug use, the number of injec\u00ad tions a day, or positive urine toxicology tests. Globally HIV prevalence among IDUs is highly variable. The notably low 1% seroprevalence of HIV infection amongIDUs inAustralia is strikingincom\u00ad parison to the 25% seroprevalence in the United States and Europe and 30-80% in Asia, Russia and Eastern Europe.c 84 In Australia the institution of needle exchange programs occurred early in the evolution of the epidemic (mid-1980s) and methadone mainte\u00ad nance treatment for opioid dependence has been read\u00ad ily available.s\" The use of such needle exchange pro\u00ad grams and pharmacotherapy for opioid dependence are key strategies that have been successfully utilized in parts ofthe world and not so effectively utilized in others.86 Effective human immunodeficiency virus risk reduc\u00ad tion interventions HIV prevention interventions have been demon\u00ad strated to be effective for both Hl'V-infected patients and high-risk HIV-negative patients (e.g., Project RESPECT).87,88 Few interventions have been devel\u00ad oped that demonstrate significant sexual and drug\u00ad relatedbehavioral riskreduction.89-92 Thoughthe orig\u00ad inal Project RESPECT did not specifically address substance using or HIV-infected populations, more recent utilization of the program, has been conducted with these populations and are being assessed. 93,94 In SouthAfrica, an HfV and alcohol risk reduction behav\u00ad ioral skills intervention among alcohol using sexual\u00ad ly transmitted infection clinic patients showed a 65% reduction in unprotected sex and a 25% increase in condom use at 6 month follow-up compared to a con\u00ad trol condition.z-' Human immunodeficiency virus testing among sub\u00ad stance users Does HIV testing have any impact on one's sub\u00ad stance use? In a survey of patients undergoing HIV testing at 5 public alcohol treatment centers, which also addressed HIV risk reduction, 26% reported a reduction in having sex with an injection drug user, 58% reported a reduction in the use of injection drugs, and 77% reported improvement in consistent condom use with multiple sexual partners at 13 months fol\u00ad IOW-Up.95 Thus, there was a clear association among HIV testing and subsequent diminished HIV risky behavior. In the HCSUS Study of 2 864 HIV-infected persons, 80% of substance users quit or cut-down after theirmv diagnosis. 96PersonswithnadirCD4counts of<50 were also more likely to quit or reduce their sub\u00ad stance use. In the past year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has made major revi\u00ad sions in recommendations for HfV testing in the US, promoting opt-out screening for patients in all health\u00ad care settings, with high risk persons being screened at least annually.v? High-risk individuals include IDUs, particularly those who share needles, and substance abuse users who use stimulants. The World Health Organization guidelines recommend opt-out screening when testing is offered, routine testing for groups with clear indications (e.g., presenting with HIV-related symptoms), and universal testing in generalized epi\u00ad demics only.98 Data to support the notion that those with risky alcohol use should be considered \"high risk\" with regards to these recommendations are less clear. Linking human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients to medical care Increasingly, it has been recognized that effective therapy and prevention for HIV-infected persons is only possible if these individuals engage in medical care.99Hl'V testing is essential to engaging Hl'V-infect\u00ad ed persons in medical care, but not sufficient.iw VoI.49-N.2 PANMINERVA MEDICA 71 SAMET ILLICIT DRUGS, ALCOHOL, AND ADDICTION IN HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS Linking newly-diagnosed HIV-infected persons with substance use to care can be accomplished with post\u00ad test counseling and referral. In the 1990's, it was demonstrated that presentation for initial HIV care after a positive test was commonly >1 year.s? A histo\u00ad ry of injection drug use was associated with this delay (P<O.OOl); men with a history of alcohol problems delayed 14.6 months longer than men who did not have such an alcohol history. WI Linkage of HIV-infected patients with substance use problems to medical and substance use treatment can help coordinate care between these important clin\u00ad ical services. Models of care linkage and coordina\u00ad tion range from centralized, comprehensive one-stop sites where patients receive all needed care and services to distributive models where referrals to needed care and services are facilitated with case managers. 102 On\u00ad site substance abuse treatment in primary care has been shown to be safe and effective. 103-107 Integrated care for alcohol and drug dependence coordinated with medical care improves addiction treatment out\u00ad comes and increases the possibility ofimproved health care utilization.I'< l07-lll Case management/multidisciplinary care for human immunodeficiency virus -infected substance users Case management is a coordinated approach to ser\u00ad vices delivery. Patient assessment, care planning, link\u00ad age to services, outcome monitoring, and advocacy for patients are addressed in a single point of contact, for substance abuse treatment, medical services and a vari\u00ad ety of social services (e.g. housing, self-help groups, and employment). Case management decreases relapse and increases retention in addiction treatment. 112, 113 Twice weekly outpatient group counseling was com\u00ad pared with counseling plus case management in a qua\u00ad si-experimental study of patients admitted to 1 of 12 addiction treatment programs. At 4 weeks, case man\u00ad agement was associated withgreaterreceipt ofaddiction, medical, psychiatric, employment, and family services, and at 6 months, with less intoxication and fewer days ofpsychiatric and medical problems.us Case manage\u00ad ment has also been found to be associated withimproved ART adherence and CD4 cell counts. 114 Substance abuse treatment An efficient way to reduce HIV transmission via substance use-related risky behaviors is to provide effective substance abuse treatment. Effective behav\u00ad ioral and pharmacological treatments exist and often combinations of these approaches may be optimal. SCREENING, COUNSELING AND BEHAVIORAL TREATMENTS Physicians can play an important role in the early detection and intervention of substance abuse among patients with HIV infection.l l S For those identified with substance use problems, clinicians can assess and address a patient's readiness to change alcohol and drug use behaviors with the use of briefinterven\u00ad tions and appropriate referral to treatment. The struc\u00ad ture ofthese interventions include the elements includ\u00ad ed in the mnemonic FRAMES: feedback about sub\u00ad stance use (e.g., quantity relative to norms); responsi\u00ad bility to stop use of substances is the patient's; argu\u00ad mentation is to be avoided; menu ofoptions to address recovery should be offered; empathy should be expressed; and self-efficacy to change one's behavior needsto besupported. 116 Takentogether, this approach involves giving clear advice about the need to change behavior, providing the patient options to help facili\u00ad tate that change, having this discussion in a manner in which empathy concerning the patient's condition is expressed while at the same time supporting the patient's self efficacy concerning their perception and their ability to achieve change. Integral to substance abuse treatment with pharma\u00ad cotherapy or without it, is substance abuse counseling or talk therapy. In the United States, methadone main\u00ad tenance clinics are required to provide counseling, and outpatient buprenorphine prescribers generally provide or refer patients to counseling. Twelve step programs are another component of substance abuse treatment that can be highly effec\u00ad tive. These programs include alcoholics anonymous (AA), narcotic anonymous (NA), and cocaine anony\u00ad mous. Such programs focus on abstinence and empha\u00ad size lifelong participation. However, abstinence is not required for participation, but rather a desire to quit drug and alcohol use. Through going to regular meet\u00ad ings, attendees build a support network and an absti\u00ad nence mentor, called a sponsor. Some communities offer day treatment programs that include AA or NA group meetings, as well as individualized counseling and case management. Halfway houses or sober hous\u00ad es, where people in treatment and recovery live togeth\u00ad er, are particularly valuable resources for patients who are homeless or whose use is triggered by where they 72 PANMINERVA MEDICA June 2007 ILLICIT DRUGS, ALCOHOL, AND ADDICTION IN HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS SAMET live. Residential or therapeutic communities are pro\u00ad grams where patients stay for weeks to months and provide more structure, usually restricting patients to the community grounds. 117 Focusing on contingencies is an increasingly impor\u00ad tant part of substance abuse treatment. Drug courts offer substance users suspended criminal penalties, contingent upon entry and completion of substance abuse treatment. 118Contingency management, a treat\u00ad ment strategy that rewards alcohol and drug users for decreased use or abstinence has been demonstrated to be efficacious in many settings.U? The practice in methadone maintenance ofgiving \"take home\" doses of methadone as a reward for urine toxicology results free of illicit substances is an example of a contin\u00ad gency management technique. PHARMACOTHERAPY The growing pharmacotherapy for addressing stance use includes buprenorphine, for opioid dependence and for alcohol dependence. Because naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfram do not have the re-enforcing methadone monly these medications. For cocaine, metam\u00ad phetamine and other psychostimulants, there are, as yet, no effective medications. Both methadone and buprenorphine are opioid replacement therapies that are highly effective for opi\u00ad oid dependence by treating withdrawal symptoms, blocking the euphoric effects of other opioids, and by reducing craving for opioids. Methadone has been used for opioid dependence in the United States for 4 decades. Its efficacy is unequivocal. It improves over\u00ad all survival, improves retention in treatment, decreas\u00ad es heroin and other drug use, decreases mvdrug risk behaviors.P? decreases hepatitis and HIV serocon\u00ad version, decreases criminal activity, increases social functioning, improves birth outcomes, and decrease obstetric complications.t>' Among HIV-infected patients onART in the Vancouver IDU Study (VillUS) methadone maintenance treatment was associated with better adherence (AOR: 22 Structured methadone programs with daily dosing have the potential to offer directly observed antiretroviral therapy, which has been asso\u00ad ciated with improved viral suppression rates in one observational study.123 Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist that has been available in France for over a decade and more recently became available (2002) through outpatient primary care physicians and psychiatrists with limit\u00ad ed additional training in the United States. It is most commonly prescribed co-formulated with naloxone and administered sublingually.l>' The purpose of the naloxone component is to discourage intravenous use. Buprenorphine's efficacy is comparable to metha\u00ad done.125 Patients who stop buprenorphine endure milder withdrawal symptoms than with methadone and encounter a lower risk ofoverdose than other opi\u00ad oids due to the agonist ceiling effect. A 12-week pilot study of buprenorphine in 16 HIV-infected patients demonstrated a decrease in opioid-positive urine tests and a decrease in HfV viral load.126 INTERACTIONS BElWEEN ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY AND OPIOID AGONIST THERAPY Providers of patients taking ART and methadone or buprenorphine should consider the known drug\u00ad drug interactions and be sure to engage in regular com\u00ad munication ifmore than one provider prescribes these medications.tv- 128 In general, since methadone pre\u00ad ceded the AIDS epidemic, its interactions with ART have been more thoroughly studied compared to buprenorphine. Within the nucleoside reverse tran\u00ad scriptase class, zidovudine (AZT) concentrations are increased in patients taking methadone. Though uncommonly reported, clinicians should be aware of methadone patients' potential for AZT-related toxici\u00ad ties, such as cytopenias. Because methadone decreas\u00ad es the concentration of didanosine (DDI) in patients taking the non-enteric coated tablets, patients on methadone and DDI should be prescribed the enteric\u00ad coated tablets only. Within the non-nucleoside tran\u00ad scriptase inhibitor class, both efavirenz and nevirapine reduce concentrations and can induce opi\u00ad oid withdrawal in methadone-maintained patients. This withdrawal may be prevented by increasing the methadone dose based on patient symptoms at the time of initiating efavirenz or nevirapine. Within the protease inhibitor class, atazanavir boosted with riton\u00ad avir has been associated with opioid excess in one case report of buprenorphine patients, thus patients should be monitored for a methadone dose reduction Vol.49 - N. 2 PANMINERVA MEDICA 73 SAMET ILLICIT DRUGS, ALCOHOL, AND ADDICTION IN HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS when starting atazanavir and ritonavir. Loprinavir/riton\u00ad avir, nelfinavir, and tipranavir are each associated with decreased methadone levels, so patients starting these medications should be monitored for withdrawal and have their methadone increased as needed. Methadone does decrease an active metabolite ofnelfinavir, though no clinically significant effects have been reported. Therapeutic drug monitoring of nelfinavir in patients receiving both may be useful particularly in the setting of virologic failure in adherent patients. 129 Chronic pain/pain management Pain management is another important dimension that at times is particularly complicated in patients with substance use. Patients with opioid dependence may be undertreated for pain due to their dependency and/or their methadone maintenance treatment.Pv- 131 Providers may consider methadone a treatment in and of itselffor pain. However, if a patient is in methadone treatment, then pain should be treated by maintaining methadone and using shorter acting narcotics given at higher doses. Treatment should be given as needed preferably on a fixed schedule to relieve the pain. Therapeutic use ofmarijuana has been examined in the Positive Health Study, a longitudinal cohort of Hlv\u00ad infected persons. Of 244 individuals using marijua\u00ad na, 44% reported both recreational and therapeutic use. 132In a randomized placebo controlled trial of 223 adults with Hl'V and symptomatic HfV sensory neu\u00ad ropathy, smoking cannabis reduced daily pain by 34% compared to 17% in the placebo group (P=0.03).133 More subjects in the cannabis group experienced a reduction >30% as compared to placebo (52% vs 24%; P=O.04). There were no serious adverse events report\u00ad ed. Conclusions In summary, drug and alcohol use are commonly encountered in subjects with or at risk ofHIV infection. Therefore, it is important to address drug and alcohol use in the context ofprevention and treatment of HIY. Targeting and tailoring HfV prevention efforts to drug and alcohol users can effectively reduce risky sexual and drug behaviors that can lead to HIV transmission. Providing behavioral and pharmacologic treatment for substance abuse can contribute to reduction in HfV risk behaviors. Optimal HIV treatment with access to ART and other medical services is crucial in the man\u00ad agement ofthe disease. A coordinated effort to integrate substance use treatment, HIV treatment, and preven\u00ad tion activities is necessary to effectively address patients' intertwining issues of substance use and HIV infection.

Rural women have limited exercise opportunities and significant barriers to engaging in physical activity. This study assessed the effect of a brief primary care based walking intervention in rural women. Methods. The participants were recruited in March, 2003 by a primary care nurse at three locations in rural Missouri. The enrolled subjects were given a pedometer, exercise videotape and provided exercise counseling at intake and four time points over 6 months. The week 1 pedometer step counts were compared with step counts at 6-month follow-up. Results. Of the initial 75 participants, 61 completed at least one follow up encounter. The participant's mean age was 42.5 years. At intake, the majority of women (90%) exhibited one or more risk factors for cardiovascular disease; 78% were obese or overweight. Although most (62%) women reported being physically active, the mean pedometer reading was low at 6337 steps per day at week 1. Over the follow-up period, participants increased their step counts by a mean of 2573 steps per day ( p<.001). Increases in step counts were seen in normal weight, overweight and obese participants. Conclusions. A simple walking intervention through a primary care practice was effective in increasing the short term walking rates of rural women.\u00a9 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Keywords: Rural health; Female; Exercise; Brief intervention; Obesity Introduction The combination of physical inactivity and poor diet is the second leading cause of death in the United States ( Mokdad et al., 2004 ), and a major contributor to disease and disability. Women report personal, social and environmental barriers toengaging in sustained physical activity ( Ainsworth et al., 2003 ). Rural women often experience greater barriers than urbanwomen, due to higher rates of poverty, chronic disease andillness, lower levels of education and greater distances to travelfor health care ( Mulder et al., 2006 ). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicated that rural women are more sedentary than urban and suburban women based on data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey(BRFSS) ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1998 ). Occupational physical activity of rural farm workers has alsodecreased due to the increased automation of the agriculture industry ( Hill and Melanson, 1999 ). Rural women report that the lack of formal exercise programs, caregiving responsibil-ities, lack of streetlights and sidewalks and little opportunity to incorporate physical exercise into daily activity prevent them from being more physically active ( Wilcox et al., 2000; Eyler, 2003; Deshpande et al., 2005 ). This has resulted in an epidemic of sedentary behavior and obesity among rural women. Primary care providers are on the front lines of managing the medical complications of obesity and physical inactivity,however their potential role in prevention and health promotionhas not been clearly demonstrated. Despite their unique position, there have been few primary care practice-based programs that have addressed physical inactivity. The ActivityCounseling Trial (ACT) ( Activity Counseling Trial Research Group, 2001 ) compared simple physician advice to physician advice combined with an ongoing educator intervention,telephone behavioral counseling, regular activity logs, andpedometer feedback. They found that among inactive primary Preventive Medicine 44 (2007) 198 -201 www.elsevier.com/locate/ypmed - see front matter \u00a9 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.ypmed.2006.10.009care patients, simple exercise advice may provide benefit to men but not to women. Women required behavioral counseling,feedback and telephone contact to increase exercise activity, andimprove their physiologic measures of physical fitness. Theintensity of the ACT intervention and the homogenousdemographics of the urban, educated, middle-income studypopulation raise questions as to its generalizability to ruralpopulations. The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of a simple primary care-based walking intervention for rural women. Methods We conducted an exercise intervention in a cohort of rural women from March to September, 2003. This study was a collaboration between the NortheastMissouri Health Council and Boston University School of Medicine and was approved by the Boston University Institutional Review Board. Women were recruited through a nurse at the Northeast Missouri Health Council Primary CareClinic, or through advertisements placed by the primary care providers at a localhair salon and food establishment. As the study was conducted in a small town (population under 17,000), the main source of recruitment came from advertisements within the community and through word of mouth. Therecruitment was conducted at all sites concurrently, and the first 75 women who expressed interest in the study and completed the baseline assessment were enrolled. All enrolled participants were patients at the Northeast Missouri HealthCouncil Primary Care Clinic. Recruitment was completed within 2 day,indicating the interest in the community for such a program. The baseline assessment was conducted at the primary care practice site. A registered nurse within the clinic obtained informed consent, demographic information and askeda single question of whether participants exercised regularly. In addition, bloodwas taken at this baseline appointment to assess non-fasting serum glucose and total cholesterol. The registered nurse also took a blood pressure, height, weight and calculated a Body Mass Index (Weight in pounds\u00f7Height in inches\u00f7Heightin inches)\u00d7703. All women were given free of charge, an exercise videotape, a pedometer (Accusplit model AX-120, San Jose, California) and written information on the importance of exercise in maintaining good health. Theexercise tape was a commercially available walking program by a well-knownfitness expert, which encouraged viewers to walk two miles over the course of the tape. Participants were also asked to keep a daily log of their step counts, and instructed to utilize the exercise videotape as part of their exercise regime.Participants were contacted by telephone by the program coordinator, a nursepractitioner within the clinic, at set time intervals (1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months) and asked for their step counts from the preceding 3 days. Previous research has indicated that a 3-day pedometer recall provides a sufficient estimateof mean pedometer-determined steps/day ( Tudor-Locke et al., 2005 ). Data was collected at all four time points to encourage continued participant engagement in the intervention. The change over the course of the study was calculated bycomparing the pedometer counts at week 1 of the intervention with counts at the6-month follow up telephone contact. If patients could not be reached at the 6- month time point, we carried forward the last known pedometer count since the 1 week assessment, either at 1 month or 3 months of the study as the 6 month timepoint. Participants were included in the analysis if they had both a 1-week and atleast 1 month of follow-up data. We repeated our analysis excluding those who failed to complete the 6 month protocol. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and normally distributed variables (i.e. age) were compared with t-tests or analysis of variance. Non-normally distributed variables (i.e. days on protocol) were compared between groups with Kruskal -Wallis tests of the Wilcoxon Rank Sum. Each woman was categorized based upon her calculated body mass index (BMI). Normal weightwas classified as a BMI under 25, overweight was a BMI of 25 or more but less than 30, and obese was a BMI 30 or more. Comparisons of mean pre and post intervention pedometer readings were assessed by analysis of variance (ANOV A). Individual paired t-tests were conducted for each of the three BMI groups and by whether they exercised regularly at baseline.Results Of the 75 women enrolled, 44 women completed the entire 6-month protocol, 10 completed 3 months of the protocol and 7completed 1 month of the protocol for a total of 61 (80%). Thedata from one participant was removed from the analysis as thestep counts reported were statistical outliers. Among the 60 women included in the final analysis, the average age was 42 years (range 22 -64 years). All participants were Caucasian, which is representative of the demographics ofthis town. Twenty-five women (42%) had Medicare or Medicaidinsurance, 26 women (43%) had a private form of insurance, and9 women (15%) had unknown insurance status or were self-pay.The mean BMI of participants was 30.6 (S.D.=7.4), with 13women normal weight (22%), 17 women were overweight(28%) and 30 women being obese (50%). Thirty-seven women (62%) reported at intake that they engaged in physical activity. There was no statistically significant difference in number ofdays in the program or in age between the normal, overweightand obese groups ( p-values of <0.90 and <0.63). Overall 54 women (90%) had one of more risk factors for developingcardiovascular disease. Thirty-two women (53%) had highblood pressure (defined as over 120 or greater systolic), three(5%) had elevated random serum glucose levels (over 200 mg/ dL), 25 women (42%) had elevated total serum cholesterol (over 200 mg/dL) and 47 women (78%) were classified as overweightor obese. As shown in Table 1 , the mean week 1 pedometer reading was 6337 steps for the entire group. Stratifying women byBMI, a statistically significant inverse trend between exerciseand weight was noted: mean baseline step counts were 7415for normal weight women, 6908 for overweight and 5545 in obese women ( f=3.15, p<.05). The average length of time from the start date to end date was 146 days (standarddeviation (S.D.)=46, range 41 -195). The overall step counts rose by 2573 after the intervention. Assuming a stride lengthof 2.25 ft per step, the widely accepted norm for women, the Table 1 Mean daily pedometer counts before and after intervention in rural women in Kirksville, Missouri from March -September, 2003 Group NPre interventionpedometer count mean (S.D).Post interventionpedometer count t-test.199 B.J. Sherman et al. / Preventive Medicine 44 (2007) 198 -201step count amounts to an increase of approximately 1.1 miles (2573 steps\u00d72.25 ft per step/5280 ft per mile=1.09 miles).There was a statistically significant difference in final meanstep count between BMI groups, with overweight womenperforming best ( f=5.06, p<.01); however, the group difference between pre and post measurements was notstatistically significant. Comparison of individual changes instep counts, both overall and in each BMI group showed a significant increase in mean step count, with greatest increase found in overweight women. The mean pedometer reading atweek 1 was statistically different for women reporting physicalactivity (mean 6972) and those who did not (mean 5314)(f=6.3, p<0.01). The individual paired t-tests of the increase in step count were statistically significant for both women whoreported at baseline being active and those who were inactive,indicating that both groups benefited from the intervention. The paired t-tests remain statistically significant even when patients who failed to complete the 6 month protocol are excluded. Discussion This study suggests that a brief intervention based within a primary care setting can achi eve short-term increases in physical activity in rural women. A videotape with home based exercises, a pedometer to provide feedback on physical activities, and reinforcement through telephone contact withnursing staff within the primary care practice were used incombination as the intervention within this study. Given the epidemic of obesity in this country, and its medical sequelae, there is a need for multiple interventions at theindividual, group and community level. Physician advice andawareness of weight as a health risk have been found to be motivational factors for improving diet and exercise concur- rently ( Huang et al., 2004 ). While the benefit of a preventive primary care-based intervention has been proven for smokingcessation ( Abdullah and Simon, 2006; Fiore et al., 2004 ), there is less evidence to support the role of the primary care practicein obesity management. The rapid enrollment in this studyunderscores the need for such an intervention within this ruralcommunity as well as the participants' trust of the primary care practice. The use of nursing staff within the primary care practice for short telephone follow-up and brief behavioralinterventions is a cost effective utilization of resources, andbuilds upon preexisting relationships to promote exercise. The use of pedometers to assess and monitor activity levels in large groups of people is appealing, as they are simple to use,inexpensive and measure walking distances with acceptableaccuracy ( Tudor-Locke et al., 2002 ). Pedometers have shown to assist in goal setting and increase motivation in minimal contact exercise interventions ( Heesch et al., 2005 ). Pedometers are an effective way to increase physical activity levels ( Stovitz et al., 2005; Croteau, 2004 ) even though their role as a biofeedback tool and motivational aid is unclear. The mean step counts ofapproximately 6300 steps per day at the start of this studyindicated that the study population was relatively inactive fortheir age compared to other Americans. Previous research has found that the average 20 to 50 year old walks between 7000and 13,000 steps per day, and average person over 50 years of age walks 6000 to 8500 steps per day ( Tudor-Locke and Myers, 2001 ). Women engage in fewer leisure activities and take fewer steps compared to men, so these numbers may overestimate theactivity levels of women ( Chan et al., 2004; Bennett et al., 2006 ). During the 6-month follow-up period, there was an average increase of over 2500 steps per day, which translatesinto participants walking over a mile more per day at the end of the intervention. All groups of participants benefited from the intervention and had significant increases in their step count,regardless of Body Mass Index or self-reported exercise statusat intake. We only collected vital signs at intake and thereforeare unable to comment on whether this increase in exerciseresulted in a change in weight or blood pressure. However,previous research has indicated that any increase in exerciselevel can decrease cardiovascular risk factors regardless of a change in BMI ( Rimmer et al., 2002; Tully et al., 2005 ). Over 78% of participants in this study can be categorized asoverweight or obese, a group who has previously shown thegreatest benefits from engaging in a physical activity program(Williams, 2005 ). While patients with obesity and weight-related conditions access health care services more frequently ( Bertakis and Azari, 2005 ), the role of the primary care practice in supporting physical activity has received little attention. Primary care physicians and nursing staff are essential to motivate patients toadopt a healthy lifestyle, but there are many barriers that existthat prevent them from being successful. Competing demandsfor time, inadequate counseling skills and knowledge, and thelack of reimbursement prevent primary care providers fromengaging in meaningful interaction with patients regardinghealth promotion and disease prevention ( Huang et al., 2004; Brotonsc et al., 2005 ). Despite these challenges, the physical consequences associated with physical inactivity and obesityare reduced with even small amounts of physical activity. Amodest 5% improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness has beenassociated with a 9% reduction in mortality risk and improveddisease outcome ( Activity Counseling Trial Research Group, 2001; Blair and Connelly, 1996 ). The average increase in step count in our study would yield cardiorespiratory changes greater than 5%, based on previous research which has correlated increases in step count with cardiorespiratory fitness(Perna et al., 2005 ). Other work has shown that walking even 3 miles per week can greatly improve disease outcome ( Holmes et al., 2005 ). This underscores the importance of even modest improvements in fitness level in overall cardiovascular riskreduction. Study limitations Our study has several limitations. One is that it only assessed short-term outcomes. The study findings would have beenstronger if a control group was used and had the groups beenrandomized to their group. We did not have sufficientinformation to generalize these findings to morbidly obese orvery inactive women. An additional limitation is that the self- reported step counts were not validated by another measure and200 B.J. Sherman et al. / Preventive Medicine 44 (2007) 198 -201were the only physical activity outcome reported. Finally our study participants were comprised of a convenience sample ofself-selected Caucasian women and were not a randomizedsample. Studies are needed to determine if long-term benefit canbe derived from instituting such an intervention in the primarycare setting, with intermittent reinforcement during otherprimary care visits. Conclusion These initial findings are promising that primary care practices can begin to address obesity through specificinterventions targeted at modifying physical activity.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behaviors are prevalent in persons with addictions. Objectives: To assess whether exposure to primary medical care is associated with decreases in HIV risk behaviors. Design: Prospective 2-year cohort of 298 adults with addictions. Outcomes: Sex and drug-related HIV risk behaviors, measured by the Risk Assessment Battery. Predictors: Cumulative number of primary care visits (0, I, ~ 2). Associations were tested us\u00ad ing regression models for correlated data. Results: In women, receipt of primary care was associated with less sex risk behavior (mean de\u00ad crease 2.1, P :::; 0.1). Among women and men, ~ 2 primary care visits was associated with lower odds of any drug risk behavior (OR =0.37, P =0.03). Conclusions: Exposure to primary care can impact HIV risk behavior favorably among adults with addictions. doi:1O.1300/J069v26n03_03 [Article copies available for a fee from The Delivery Service: Press, Inc.

Primarycare.HIY.risk behavior, addictions INTRODUCTION In the U.S., 5 million adults engage in HIV risk behavior. I These behaviors, such as unpro\u00ad tectedsexandinjection ofillicitdrugs, aremore prevalent in persons with addictions.t-' There are 800,000-900,000 HIV-infected persons in the U.S.; approximately 40,000 new cases are diagnosed yearly, most of whom are persons engaging in high-risk behavior.t Fortunately, randomized controlled trials and observational studies suggest thatHIV pre\u00ad vention programs decrease the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. Such programs have targeted high-risk populations.v!'' HIV prevention programs in alcohol! 1,12 and drug abuse->'? treatment settings have also demon\u00ad strated success. Programs that offer, in addi\u00ad tion, on-site primary medical care have shown improvements in other medical and social as\u00ad pects in persons with addictions.w-\" However, few people at risk receive health care in these settings. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends that all adolescents and adults be assessed and counseled regarding HIV risk behavior.\" However, such practices are not, as yet, routinely performed in primary care.22-24 Nonetheless, it is likely that some ef\u00ad forts in HIV risk reduction are occurring in such settings. It is possible that exposure to primary care for persons with addictions plays a role in moderating health risk behaviors, including those that are HIV -related. For example, pri\u00ad mary medical care offered in an addiction pro\u00ad gram setting has been associated with lower addiction severity. 19 Although the efficacy of HIV-prevention educational tools in primary care has been stud\u00ad ied, the impact of HIV risk reduction counsel\u00ad ing delivered outside ofresearch settings (e.g., as delivered in usual primary care offices) has not been well described.25,26 This study aimed to test the hypothesis that linkage to primary care in the community by persons with addic\u00ad tions without primary care is associated withre\u00ad duced HIV sex and drug risk behavior. METHODS Study Design This study is a prospective cohort of adults with addictions, recruited from a residential de\u00ad toxification program that represents a second\u00ad ary data analysis of a randomized controlled trial. Subjects were participants in the Health Evaluation andLinkage toPrimarycare(HELP) study, arandomized controlled trial ofsubjects (adults with addictions) toeithera single multi\u00ad disciplinary evaluation and referral to facilitate linkage of patients to primary care (enhanced care) or to usual care at the detoxification pro\u00ad gram. Between 1997 and 1999,470 of 642 eli\u00ad gible subjects provided informed consent and agreed to participate in the HELP study; 69% of those randomized to enhanced care and 53% of those randomized to usual care, linked to pri\u00ad mary care. Eighty-five percent of all subjects had at least one follow-up visit after study entry. Sixty percent ofsubjectsdidnothavehealth in\u00ad surance; half were homeless; and all resided in proximity to the detoxification center (Boston). The intervention (enhanced care) and the con\u00ad trol (usual care) groups did not focus on HIV risk counseling. Details of the trial have been published elsewhereP This current study was a secondary analysis of data collected from sub\u00ad jects in the HELP study. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Boston University Medi\u00ad cal Center; additional confidentiality protec\u00ad tion was provided byacertificate ofconfidenti\u00ad ality from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. All subjects provided written informed consent. Subjects Subjects were enrolled from June 1997 to March 1999. Inclusion criteria were the follow\u00ad ing: 18 years of age or older; alcohol, cocaine, or heroin as first or second drug of choice; and no primary care (PC) provider. Patients were excluded if they were unable to speak either English or Spanish, were pregnant, unable to provide contacts for follow-up, had plans to 19 Takizawa et al. leave the area, or had evidence of dementia (Mini-Mental state examination score < 21). Research interviews were scheduled at 6-month intervals for a total of 2 years. The current cohort analysis was restricted to subjects who had at least 2 follow-up research interviews af\u00ad terstudy entry to ensure that HIV riskbehaviors could be assessed at an interview subsequent to that where the number of PC visits was re\u00ad corded. Of the 470 subjects in the study, 298 met this last criterion and comprised our full study cohort. Assessments Trained research associates interviewed subjects at the detoxification unit after enroll\u00ad mentand resolution ofacute withdrawal symp\u00ad toms. Assessments, which were repeated at each follow-up research interview, included demographics, receipt of primary care (PC), HIV risk behaviors, alcohol and drug addiction severity,\" and health-related quality of life.\" Receipt ofPC was assessed by asking subjects, at each follow-up interview, ifthey had visiteda doctor, nurse practitioner, or physician assis\u00ad tant. Subjects were asked how many times in the past 6 months (or since the last research in\u00ad terview) they had seen that clinician. Subjects were asked the clinician's specialty, whether ~hey would call that clinician for non-emergent Issues, or whether that clinician could be their regular personal doctor. When patients did not know the specialty, attempts to contact the clinician were made to determine it. HIV sex and drug risk behavior were as\u00ad sessed by the short version ofthe Risk Assess\u00ad ment Battery (RAB).3\u00b0-32 Items for each com\u00ad ponent (sex and drugrisk) asked about HIV risk behavior in the past six months. The RAB-sex component is composed of six items address\u00ad ing the number of partners, sexual orientation, use of condoms, sex trade, and visits to crack houses. The RAB-drug component is com\u00ad posedof8 items, addressing injection ofdrugs, needle sh~ring, and visits to a shooting gallery. The validity and reliability of the RAB instru\u00ad ment has previously been established.\" Study entry alcohol and drug addiction se\u00ad verity were assessed using the Addiction Sever\u00ad ity Index (ASI). Health-related quality of life was assessed using the Short Form Health Sur\u00ad vey (SF_36).28,29 \\ Dependent Variables/Outcomes There were two main outcomes of interest assessed at the time point subsequent to the pri\u00ad mary care exposure assessment. The RAB-sex score was modeled as a continuous variable, with scores ranging from 0 (least risk) to 18 (most risk). The RAB-drug score, with scores rangingfrorrrO (leastrisk) to 22 (most risk), was dichotomized to 0 (no HIV drug risk behavior) and > I (any HIV drug risk behavion for two reasons: (1) Most (63%) of the RAB-drug scores were 0, and (2) aRAB-drug scoreofOin\u00ad dicates that the subject did not inject drugs in the past6months. ARAB-drug score of1indi\u00ad cates injecting drugs in the past 6 months (ex\u00ad ~ept for 4 subjects who did not report injecting In the past 6 months but had visited a shooting gallery) and a score of two or more indicates that the individual injected drugs in the past six monthsandhadsomedegree ofneedle sharing. Independent Variables/Predictors The primary independent variable was the self-reported cumulative number of primary care (PC) visits received after study entry as as\u00ad sessed ateach follow-up-interview. For the visit to be defined as PC, two criteria needed to be met: (1) the subject reported having a regular personal doctor, would call the doctor for a non-emergent issue, or saw a doctor that could be their regular personal doctor; and (2) the doctor was in a specialty that could be consid\u00ad ered.~,including obstetrics/gynecology, family medicine, adolescent cardiology, clinician's spe\u00ad cialty was confirmed either by direct contact or by self-report. The remaining 8% of visits met the first criterion, but the specialty of the pro\u00ad vider remained unverified; visits to these PC visits), 1(1 PCvisit)and~2(2 or more PC visits), due to the skewed distribu\u00ad tion of the number of PC visits.'? The curnula\u00ad20 JOURNAL OF ADDICTIVE DISEASES tive number of PC visits was modeled as a time-varying covariate that predicted HIV risk behaviors assessed at the subsequent follow-up research interview. Self-report ofPC wascompared toadminis\u00ad trative data sources from PC practices based at the Boston Medical Center and the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program. Ninety\u00ad fivepercent ofallstudy subjectshaddata avail\u00ad able from these sources; of those who had PC visits in these data, 81% self-reported receipt of PC. In the analyses, other variables (assessed at study entry) were considered: age, marital sta\u00ad tus, race/ethnicity, ASI (Addiction Severity Index) drug and alcohol scales, the mental (MCS) and physical (PCS) component sum\u00ad mary scores from the SF-36, and randomiza\u00ad tion group (usual care or enhanced evaluation and referral at study entry). The alcohol and drug scales ofthe ASI were used to summarize addiction severity, with scores ranging from 0 (no severity) to 1 (highest severity). The MCS and PCS scores (scale of 0-100) are standard\u00ad ized to the U.S. general population; mean scores foreachare50, with a standarddeviation of 10. Scores below this mean represent indi\u00ad viduals with worse physical or mental health\u00ad related quality of life. Statistical Analysis Analyses were performed using SAS/STAT software (Version 8.2.). The analyses of the RAB-sex score focused on the overall sample, referred to as the \"HIV sex risk sample\" (n = 298), and analyses of the RAB-drug score fo\u00ad cused on a subgroup that reportedeverinjecting drugs at study entry (\"HIV drug risk sample,\" n = 110). Descriptive statistics for study entry charac\u00ad teristics were obtained separately for each sample. RAB scores were analyzed using lon\u00ad gitudinal regression models to account for cor\u00ad relation due to repeated observations on the same subject. Fully adjusted regression models controlled for time since study entry, gender, race/ethnicity, randomization group, ASI-al\u00ad cohol,ASl-drug,MCS, PCS, and inde\u00ad pendent variable, cumulative number of pri\u00ad mary care (PC) visits as assessed at each fol\u00adlow-up interview, was time-varying. The ex\u00ad pectedeffect ofaparticular dose or threshold of PC on HIV risk behavior was not known, there\u00ad fore each level ofPC exposure were compared to no receipt of PC in all analyses. For the RAB-sex score, a continuous out\u00ad come, data were analyzed using generalized linear models for correlated data implemented with PROC MIXED. Unadjusted (adjusting only for time since study entry) and fully ad\u00ad justed models were fit. A third model that in\u00ad cluded baseline RAB-sex scores in the fully ad\u00ad justed models was also fit to the data. Because of likely differential response ofwomen to PC and sexual risk behavior,33,34 an interaction be\u00ad tween gender and receipt of PC was tested. If there was evidence ofan interaction (p < 0.10), analyses were subsequently stratified on gender. For the RAB-drug score, a dichotomous out\u00ad come, data were analyzed using generalized es\u00ad timating equations logistic regression models implemented with PROC GENMOD. Three models were fit: unadjusted, fully adjusted, and fully adjusted controlling additionally for RAB-drug scores at study entry. An interaction between gender and receipt of PC was not tested, as there was no hypothesis ofdifferential response. RESULTS Patient Characteristics Subject characteristics at study entry and subsequent receipt of primary care (PC) are presented in Table 1. These characteristics were similar to those of the 470 subjects in the original HELP study, with the exception of baseline RAB-drug scores (which as expected were higher in the HIV-drug risk sample). The majority of subjects was male, unmarried and had relatively poor mental health-related quality of life. Of the 298 subjects, 4.7% were 18-24 years of age, 80.2% were 25-44 years, and 15.1% were45 years or older. In addition, the length of stay in the detoxification center (from which the subjects were recruited) for the 298 subjects was 4.7 days (SD = 1.9 days). Twenty percent of the 298 subjects had asthma, emphysema or chronic lung disease; 16% had high blood pres\u00ad21 Takizawa et al. TABLE 1.

When additionally adjusting for HIV drug risk behavior at study entry, this association was no longer statistically significant (OR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.17-1.26), although the magnitude of association remained notable. DISCUSSION In this study, receipt of primary care (PC) was associated with a decrease in HIV sex risk behavior among women with addictions. In men, receipt of PC appeared to be associated with a decrease in HIV sex risk behavior; how\u00ad ever, this decreasewasattenuated andnolonger statistically significant in adjusted analyses. Men and women with a history of injecting drugs were less likely to engage in HIV drug risk behavior if they received ~ 2PC visits over the two-year period. The magnitude of this as\u00ad sociation was notable but no longer statistically significant in an analysis adjusting for HIV drug risk behavior at study entry. In nearly all analyses,even after adjusting forpotential con\u00ad founders, the RAB-sex and drug scores were 23 Takizawa et al. loweramongsubjectsexposedtoPc. Although the significance ofRAB score decreases did not persist in some adjusted analyses, the consis\u00ad tency of the direction of association between exposure to PC and these scores suggests that PC affects HIV risk behaviors. We found an association between visiting a primary care provider and HIV risk behavior reduction. Whilewedid not collectinformation on what counseling occurred (if any) at the pri\u00ad mary care visits, there are at least three possible explanations for this association: primary care, eitherthevisit and relationship itselforspecific risk-reduction counseling that occurred during the visit, could cause risk behavior reduction; otherexposures, such asspecialized risk reduc\u00ad tion counseling resulting from primary care re\u00ad ferral or found by the patient him or herself, couldlead todecreased risk behaviors; or, some other factor could cause both an increased like\u00ad lihoodtovisit aprimarycareproviderandcause areductioninHIV risk behavior. To address the latter possibility, we performed analyses that adjusted for factors known to be associated withreceiptofprimarycare (e.g.,gender, medi\u00ad cal illness). We recognize, however, that these analyses cannot completely eliminate con\u00ad founding by self-selection to primary care. Only a study that randomized patients to pri\u00ad mary care exposure could settle this question. Further studies on the content of primary care and utilization of specific primary care inter\u00ad ventions are needed to better understand the as\u00ad sociation we observed between primary care and HIV risk behaviors. Nonetheless, it does appear that reduction in HIV risk behaviors can now be added to reductions in addiction severity asapotential benefitofprimarymedical care. 19 In prior studies, brief counseling interven\u00ad tions have led to decreases in HIV risk behav\u00ad iors. In a randomized controlled trial of brief counseling (two 20-minute face-to-face HIV education sessions) in sexually transmitted dis\u00ad ease (STD) clinics, condom use increased and STD rates decreased in the subsequent year.? Similarly, prospective cohort studies in adults attending drug treatment programs, that in\u00ad cluded HIV risk counseling, observed de\u00ad creases in HIV risk behavior.Ud? The magnitude of decrease in risk behavior associated with PC exposure in our cohort (e.g., 1-2 points in the RAB-sex score) is clinically important and similar to that seen in studies of risk reduction counseling. Cocaine-de\u00ad pendent subjects randomized to HIV risk re\u00ad ductioncounseling (i.e., 2-3 sessions/week for 6 months), had mean RAB-sex score decreases of 1.5-2.7.35 A I-pointdecreasein theRAB-sex score could represent anarray ofchanges: from using condoms mostofthe time to always, from having two sexual partners to one, from ex\u00ad changing sex for drugs to no such exchange. A l-point decrease in RAB-drug scores could represent a change from injecting to not inject\u00ad ing drugs, from sharing to not sharing needles, or from sharing to not sharing a cooker. A 2-point or more decrease in either score signi\u00ad fies either a greater decrease in a single risk be\u00ad havioror adecreaseinmultiplerisk behaviors. There were strengths and limitations of this study. As an observational study, causality be\u00ad tween receipt of PC and HIV risk behavior could not be established. Consistent dose-re\u00ad sponse relationships between PC and HIV risk behavior reductions were not observed. How\u00ad ever, it is unclear whether PC exposure would operate in such a fashion or via a threshold ef\u00ad fect. The observed associations could be due to uncontrolled confounding (i.e., unmeasured HIV risk reduction counseling or effects of the multidisciplinary assessment and referral inter\u00ad vention). However, data were collected pro\u00ad spectively, and possible confounders such as health and addiction severity, demographics, and risk behaviors at study entry were ac\u00ad counted for. Furthermore, the intervention (randomization to usual or enhanced care) is unlikely to explain these findings; more than half of the control (usual care) group received PC and the intervention, adjusted for in the analyses, did not affect HIV risk behavior.27 The outcome in this study was not a specific risk behavior. While this choice may present a challenge for interpretation, it is a strength in that a validated scale that represents a range of risk behaviors was used. Small sample size may have limited our abil\u00ad ity to detect statistically significant results in some comparisons. For example, in the HIV drug risk analysis, there were only 22 observa\u00ad tions in which subjects received. one PC visit. Despite small subgroups and what may appear to be a relatively weak exposure in the context ofmanyotherexposures (e.g., tosubstance use, 24 JOURNAL OF ADDICTIVE DISEASES other health care), an effect of PC on HIV risk behaviors was detected. The fact that any effect was detected is remarkable as it was not likely that the content of any particular PC visit fo\u00ad cused on HIV risk behavior assessment and counseling. Generalizability may be limited to urban,innercity,orhigh-risk groups; however, these are the populations that would particu\u00ad larly benefit from HIV risk reduction interven\u00ad tions. Furthermore, the severity ofHIV risk be\u00ad havior of subjects in this study was similar to those observed in other study populations with addictions.W'? Finally, self-report ofPC as de\u00ad fined in this study did not agree perfectly with administrative data. Although concordance was good, neither source is perfect. While HIV risk reduction interventions in research or clinical settings can decrease HIV risk behaviors, this study suggests that receipt ofPC, as it is currently delivered in the commu\u00ad nity. can have a role in improving HIV risk be\u00ad havior in persons with addictions. These find\u00ad ings support linkage to PC for such patients and national recommendations that PC clinicians counsel adul t and adolescent patients regarding HIV risk behavior. Further research should fo\u00ad cus on facilitating referral of patients (espe\u00ad cially those with addictions) to PC, incorporat\u00ad ing HIV risk reduction counseling into these settings and studying what components of PC are key for improving HIV risk behavior.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: It is unknown whether testing HIV-infected individuals for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and informing them of their HCV status impacts subsequent alcohol use. We hypothesized thatHIV-infected individuals with current or past alcoholproblems who reported being told they had HCV were more likely to 1) abstain from alcohol and 2) not drink unhealthy amounts compared to individuals who had not been told. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: Da- ta from a prospective, observational cohort study (HIV- Longitudinal Interrelationships of Viruses and Ethanol) were used to assess the association between awarenessof having HCV at baseline and subsequent abstinence and not drinking unhealthy amounts as reported at 6- month follow-up intervals. General estimating equa-tions logistic regression was used to account for the correlation from using repeated observations from the same subject over time. We adjusted for age, sex, race,homelessness, injection drug use, depressive symp- toms, and having abnormal liver tests. RESULTS: Participants who reported being told they had HCV were more likely to report abstaining from alcohol (AOR=1.60; 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.27) and 95% CI: 1.01 to 2.11). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients infected with HIV who had a history of alcohol problems, reporting being told one had HCV was associated with greater abstinencefrom alcohol and less unhealthy amounts of drinking. KEY WORDS: alcohol; hepatitis C; HIV; awareness of diagnosis. DOI: 10.1007/s11606-007-0147-y\u00a9 2007 Society of General Internal Medicine 2007;22:822 -825BACKGROUND Because of overlapping risk factors, approximately 30% of individuals with HIV are co-infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV).1Alcohol and HIV infection are both associated with more rapid progression of HCV-related liver disease;2,3there- fore, it is recommended that all patients with HCV, and in particular those who are co-infected with HIV/HCV, abstain from or at least moderate their alcohol use.4It is unknown whether patients with HIV who use alcohol change their behavior in response to being diagnosed with HCV. We examined the effect of reporting being told one had HCV on drinking in a cohort of patients with HIV and a history ofalcohol problems, hypothesizing that patients who reported being told they had HCV were more likely to have reduced alcohol consumption compared to individuals who had notbeen told. METHODS Design. Data were from a prospective, observational cohort study (HIV-Longitudinal Interrelationships of Viruses andEthanol [HIV-LIVE]) in which assessments occurred at 6- month intervals over a maximum of 42 months. Subjects. Recruitment occurred from a previous cohort study, an intake clinic for HIV-infected patients, HIV primary care and specialty clinics, homeless shelters, drug treatment programs, subject referrals, and flyers. Enrollment occurredbetween August 2001 and July 2003. Eligibility criteria were as follows: 1) documented HIV antibody test by ELISA and confirmed by Western blot; 2) 2or more affirmative responses to the CAGE alcohol screening questionnaire 5,6or physician investigator diagnosis of alcohol- ism; 3) ability to speak English or Spanish. Exclusion criteriaincluded: 1) scoring <21 on the 30-item Folstein Mini-MentalState Examination 7,8and 2) inability to provide informed consent. The Institutional Review Boards of Boston Medical Center and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center approvedthis study.Received August 30, 2006 Revised December 7, 2006Accepted January 30, 2007Published online February 23, 2007 822Outcomes. The two outcomes of interest were abstinence and not drinking unhealthy amounts in the past 30 days. At each6-month study visit past-month alcohol consumption was assessed using a validated calendar method (Alcohol timeline followback). 9Abstinence was defined as no drinks in the past 30 days. Unhealthy drinking amounts were defined as: 1) greater than 14 standard drinks per week, or greater than 4 drinks on occasion for men, or 2) greater than 7 drinks in thepast week or greater than 3 drinks on occasion for women. 10 Independent Variables. The primary independent variable was awareness of HCV diagnosis. This was defined as a positiveresponse to the question \"Has a doctor ever told you that you had hepatitis C? \"which was queried at study entry only. A negative response could either mean that a patient had been tested and told he/she did not have hepatitis C, or that he/shewas never tested. Additional covariates were self-reported age, sex, race, recent (in the past 6 months) homelessness, recent injectiondrug use, depressive symptoms, and having abnormal liver enzymes. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D), 11 and a threshold of 16 was used to define a higher level of depressive symptoms. Secondary analyses used information on chronic infection as determined by HCV RNA levels onpolymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Statistical Analysis. Chi-square and Student 'sttests were used to compare baseline characteristics of subjects who reported being told by a doctor they had hepatitis C compared to thosewho did not report being told. General estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, adjusting for other covariates. TheGEE approach was used to account for the correlation from using repeated observations from the same subject over time. An exchangeable working correlation structure was used andempirical standard errors are reported for all analyses.Collinearity of covariates was assessed by calculating the correlation between independent variables and no pair ofvariables had a correlation >0.40. A two-tailed pvalue <0.05 was considered statistically significant for all hypothesis testing. To assess whether the effect of being told was 1)independent from having actual infection and 2) did not differ by actual infected status, we did secondary analyses adjusting for and stratifying by HCV RNA status (detectable vsundetectable). We also performed additional analyses, adjusting for site of recruitment. Analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC,USA). RESULTS The study sample was comprised of 400 participants, of which211 (53%) reported being told by a physician that they hadhepatitis C. The latter patients were more likely to be older, female, homeless, currently using injection drugs, have more depressive symptoms, and have abnormal liver enzymes(Table 1). At baseline, 64% of patients who were told they had hepatitis C reported abstinence from alcohol versus 52% of patients who were never told they had hepatitis C ( pvalue= 0.02). Fewer individuals who had been told they had hepatitis C reported drinking unhealthy amounts (27% told vs 36% never told, pvalue=0.09). The median follow-up time for patients was 18 months. Reporting being told one had hepatitis C was positively associated with abstinence and not drinking unhealthy amounts in multivariable logistic regression models (Table 2). Participants who reported being told they had hepatitis C had approximately one and a half times the odds of abstaining fromalcohol and not drinking unhealthy amounts compared toparticipants who had not been told they had hepatitis C (AOR for abstinence=1.60; 95% CI: 1.13 95% CI: 1.01 to 2.11). Secondaryanalyses adjusting for recruitment site produced similar results (data not shown).Table 1.

Of the individuals who had been told they had HCV, 85% had detectable HCV RNA; 88% had HCV RNA. Adjusting for HCV RNA did not attenuate the impact of being told of HCV infection on abstinence (AOR=1.59, 95% CI: 95% CI: 0.79 to 3.1), thus it appeared the effect of being told was independent of actual infection. Also, the effect of being told did not differ bystatus of HCV RNA: odds ratios were similar and confidenceintervals overlapped. DISCUSSION Among patients infected with HIV who had current or pastalcohol problems, reporting being told one had hepatitis C was associated with greater odds of abstaining from alcohol and a lower odds of drinking unhealthy amounts. The results from asecondary analysis suggest that it is being told of one 's hepatitis C diagnosis, rather than actually having infection, that is linked to the effect on drinking. This finding is clinicallyrelevant, as it gives indirect support to the hypothesis thattelling patients that they have HCV may lead to less unhealthy alcohol use, which in turn can impact long-term outcomes among patients who are co-infected with HIV and HCV. Our findings appear to be consistent with limited prior research. A study of HIV positive veterans also found a higher rate of abstinence among patients who were co-infected withHCV (based on antibody testing) compared to patients with HIV alone. 12Studies in other populations not specifically HIV- infected have been mixed, finding either less alcohol use forthose aware of their HCV status or no effect. 13-16 Although the absolute difference in abstinence and un- healthy use between the 2 groups was modest, these differ-ences could nonetheless translate into substantial gains on apopulation level. Approximately 4 million Americans \u20141.6% of the population \u2014are believed to be infected with HCV. 17It is estimated that 5 -20% of those infected will develop cirrhosis after 20 years; once diagnosed with cirrhosis, the risk of developing hepatocellular cancer may be 1 -4% per year.4,18 Heavy alcohol use has a synergistic affect with HCV infection and greatly increases the odds of developing cirrhosis and liver cancer.19,20Therefore, if screening and notifying individuals of their HCV positive status leads to even modest improvementsin alcohol use, a substantial number of individuals might avert liver complications. This study has several important limitations. We did not assess whether patients received advice about their drinkingso we cannot determine whether patients changed their behavior in response to physician counseling. Drinking was based on participants 'self-report; despite using a validated tool and assuring confidentiality, patients who were told they had hepatitis C and were aware that they should not be drinking may have been more likely to misrepresent theiralcohol use (social desirability bias). Finally, although we adjusted for confounders, there may have been residual confounding. Among a cohort of HIV-infected individuals with current or past alcohol problems, reporting being told that one had hepatitis C was associated with greater abstinence and lessunhealthy amounts of drinking. Testing HIV-infected patients for HCV and informing them of their status may lead them to drink less, and thus reduce their likelihood of developing HCV-associated liver disease.

Volandes, Center for Bioethics, Brigham & Women's Hospital Michael K. Paasche-Orlow, Boston University School of Medicine Limited health literacy is a pervasive and independent risk factor for poor health outcomes. Despite decades of reports exhibiting that the healthcare system is overly complex, unneeded complexity remains commonplace and endangers the lives of patients, especially those with limited health literacy. In this article, W~ define 11ealth literacyand describe the empirical evidence associating health literacy and poor health outcomes. We recast the issue of poor health literacy from within the ethical perspective of the least well-off and argue that poor health outcomes deriving from limited health literacy ought to be understood as a fundamental injustice of the healthcare system. We offer three proposals that attempt to rectify this injustice, including: universal precautions that presume limited health literacy for all heelthcare users; expanded use of technology supported communication; and clinical incentives that account for limited health literacy. Keywords: Health Literacy: health disparities; justice; health policy; health outcomes; pay for performance Approximately 90 million American adults lack the liter\u00ad discourse on the moral implications of the emerging litera\u00ad acy skills needed to use the healthcare system (Nielsen\u00ad ture on health literacy may help lead to amelioration of this 45 15 Bohlman et a!. 2004). The prevalence of limited literacy is source of basic inequalities in health. particularly high among those with lower levels of educa\u00ad tion, the elderly, minorities, and those with chronic disease (Paasche-Orlow et a!. 200Sb). An emerging literature has HEALTH LITERACY AND HEALTH OUTCOMES begun to describe the myriad health consequences of lim\u00ad Health literacy is the \"degree to which individuals have the 20 ited literacy (DeWalt et a!. 2004).

Though more than literacy skills, such as reading, arithmetic, and using docu\u00ad 300 articles in the medical literature exhibit ways healthcare ments are core attributes of the broader concept, health lit\u00ad 25 is overly complex for people with limited literacy; the recent eracy also includes skills such as: how to use the healthcare shift toward shared decision-making, consumer-oriented system; having cognitive dimensions such as memory and 55 healthcare, and programs such as Medicare Part D are evi\u00ad attention; and, displaying adequate neurosensory capaci\u00ad dence of increasing complexity (Parker et a!. 2003). Despite ties such as vision and hearing (Baker 2006). Another key the clear injustice of a healthcare system that is organized feature of the definition is that health literacy highlights the 30 for the most literate and powerful members of our society, contextual demands placed on the individual. Many peo\u00ad the medical ethics literature has neglected some of our most ple who experience literacy barriers would not experience 60 vulnerable patients by remaining largely quiet about the such limitations if the healthcare system were to be stream\u00ad ethical implications of health literacy. lined, simplified, and standardized (Paasche-Orlow et a!.

Furthermore, limited health literacy has been 70 bring greater attention to a significant limitation in the cur\u00ad shown to be an independent risk factor of worse outcomes rent healthcare system and that instigating a far-reaching and health disparities independent of race and et Baker et a1. 2002; Paasche-Orlow et a1. 2005a; Sudore et a1. 2006b; Wolf et al. 2006b). Limited health literacy is associated with low health 75 knowledge, increased incidence of chronic illness, poorer intermediate disease markers, and less than optimal use of preventive health services (Berkman et a1. 2004). Numer\u00ad ous studies have exhibited the association between limited health literacy and health outcomes; in two separate stud\u00ad 80 ies, limited health literacy has been linked with mortality (DeWalt et a1. 2004;Sudore et a1. 2006b; Wolfet a1. 2006a)For example, in a community sample of 2,512 men and women age 70 to 79 years, Sudore et a1.(2006b) found that, over the course of a mean follow-up of 5.1 years, those with limited 85 health literacy had a higher risk of death than those with ad\u00ad equate literacy (19.7%versus 10.6%, respectively). In other words, the rate of death for those with limited health liter\u00ad acy was approximately twice the rate of death among those with adequate literacy (hazard ratio of 2.03;95% confidence 90 interval 1.62 to 2.55). Furthermore, in the same study (Sudore et a1. 2006b),af\u00ad ter adjusting for age, race, gender, income, education, health status, healthbehaviors, health access, and psychosocial sta\u00ad tus, health literacy remained an independent risk factor for 95 all-cause mortality with a hazard ratio of 1.75 (95% confi\u00ad dence interval 1.27 to 2.41).To put the size of this effect into context, Malik et a1. (2004)found that having diabetes con\u00ad ferred a 1.97 (95% confidence interval 1.59 to 2.43) adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality among 6,255 subjects 100 with an average of 13.4years of follow-up in the Second Na\u00ad tional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II),i.e., the health impact of having limited health literacy is Q2 on the order of having diabetes. Justice and Healthcare 105 Previous critiques of the high literacy demands of the healthcare system have focused primarily on the issue of autonomy. For example, attention has been paid to the over\u00ad whelming complexity of informed consentforms and efforts havebeen made to simplify the consent processin ways that 110 are successful with patients who have limited literacy skills (Paasche-Orlow et a1.2003; Sudore et a1. 2006a). The auton\u00ad omy of healthcare users with limited literacy is thwarted if the forms intended to preserve their individual autonomy are inaccessible. 115 While concern for patient autonomy is well placed, a more thorough evaluation of the moral consequences of limited health literacy can be assessed through an analy\u00ad sis of the requirements of justice. The complexity of the healthcare system negatively affects the health of people 120 with limited literacy, and much of this complexity is un\u00ad needed. The lens of justice helps focus the discussion on how this unneeded complexity and the general assumption of high literacy skills influence health and promote racial and ethnic health disparities. While it is inappropriate to ig\u00ad 125 nore patients' values and preferences and cynical to ignore opportunities to advance patient autonomy by improving patient education materials, consent forms, notices of pri\u00ad 2 ajob vacy protection (Paasche-Orlow et al. 2oo5c), patient's bill of rights documents (Paasche-Orlow 2006), and the like, we believe the problem of limited health literacy should pri\u00ad130 marily be understood as an issue of health inequality and justice. One widely used criterion for examining the role of jus\u00ad tice in health inequalities is the position of the least well-off in a healthcare system (Daniels 1985;Rawls 1971). Presently, 135 the healthcare system places little importance on the posi\u00ad tion of the least well-off in the context of health literacy. The average English reading level for American adults is between the eighth and ninth grade; the average reading level of many documents designed for patients, including 140 education materials, explanations of benefits and services, and documents outlining patients' rights such as informed consent forms, notices of privacy protection, and advanced directives documentation, continue to be written at the se\u00ad nior high-school level or higher (Paasche-Orlow et aI. 2003; 145 Paasche-Orlow et aI. 2005c; Paasche-Orlow 2006). Despite the fact that one in three users of the healthcare system has limited literacy, a high level of literacy is typically assumed and the healthcare system remains fit only for users with the highest literacy. 150 The primacy and importance of the position of the least well-off in any healthcare system has been an influential criterion for evaluating the justice of a healthcare system, especially in theories of distributive justice. The position of the least well-off more generally has been a common thread 155 in numerous religious philosophies and most closely associ\u00ad ated with the ethical theory of prioritarianism (parfit 1991). Previous uses of this principle in the healthcare contextstem from the widely influential maximin principle found in the philosophical and economics literature, most notably in the 160 work of the philosopher John Rawls (1971).In Rawls' frame\u00ad work, decision-makers, who are behind a veil of ignorance and unaware of their positions in a society, would design a system in which the position of the least well-off is maxi\u00ad mized regardless of the potentially negative impacton those 165 better off (Rawls 1971). In the healthcare context, decision\u00ad makers using the maximin principle would design a sys\u00ad tem that places the least fortunate healthcare users in the least unfortunate situation. For decision-makers consider\u00ad ing the least well-offin terms of health literacy, the mostjust 170 arrangement would be one that ensured that the health\u00ad care system was designed to benefit users with limited literacy. The reorganization of healthcare to fulfill the prioritar\u00ad ian objectives raised in discussions of health literacy would 175 involve the elevation of patient education to be a core func\u00ad tion of health providers. Instead of assuming literacy and then trying to retrofit care for low literacy patients as some form of specialty service, application of the maximin prin\u00ad ciple leads us to the conclusion that the standard of care 180 should be reoriented to the needs of health consumers with limited literacy. In the remaining sections, we will explore three examples of how efforts in clinical care and health policy can help shift the standard of care to make the needs of patients with limited literacy a priority and begin to 185 November, Volume 7, Number 11,2007 AJB.c1s September 11, 2007 17:11 address the fundamental injustice arising from an unnec\u00ad essarily complex healthcare system. UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS FOR LIMITED HEALTH LITERACY 190 Presently, the standard of care or default position of physi\u00ad cians commencing discussions with patients is to assume a high level of literacy. limited health literacy is some kind of exception to the rule, and patient education is contin\u00ad gent on a patient asking for more information. Indeed, 195 physicians rarely evaluate comprehension (Schillinger et al. 2003; Schillinger et al. 2004). Patients are trained to say that they understand everything clearly when clinicians inquire about questions while rising from a chair with one hand on the doorknob. Similarly, patients with limited literacy often 200 conceal their lack of understanding to avoid shame (Parikh et al. 1996). Consequently, clinicians frequently fail to eval\u00ad uate comprehension adequately and rarely take the time to teach their patients until they can confirm that critical self\u00ad management skills are understood (Schillinger et al. 2003). 205 This approach is detrimental to patients. A standard of care that assumes a high level of literacy should be thought of as a risky venture. We suggest a change in the standard of care - a 'flip\u00ad ping' of the default - in which the universal assumption 210 is limited literacy. The key added activity for the healthcare team would be to confirm comprehension of the clinical plan with every patient at multiple steps of the care continuum. This confirmation can be done with a \"teach-back\" model in which each patient is asked to state or exhibit the care 215 plan so the healthcare team can provide additional educa\u00ad tion focused on items the patient has not understood until the patient is able to confirm comprehension (Schillinger et al. 2003). Ongoing education until a learner can confirm comprehension is known as a \"teach-to-goal\" or \"teach-to\u00ad 220 mastery\" educational technique and has been shown to be effective (Paasche-Orlow et al. 2005a; Sudore et al. 2006a). For example, a study of confirming comprehension of the medication regimen and inhaler technique among patients with asthma revealed that: 1) patients with limited literacy 225 had worse comprehension at baseline; 2) all patients were able to exhibit mastery after the teach-to-goal process; and 3) comprehension at 2 weeks was similar for patients with and without limited literacy (Paasche-Orlow et al. 2005a). Available evidence suggests that confirming patient 230 comprehension is worthwhile and would decrease the self\u00ad management deficits associated with limited literacy. Un\u00ad der current conventions, the amount of information given to patients seems to be linked to a clinician's judgment of the complexity of the information, the severity of the risks, 235 or other medicolegal attributes of healthcare. We want pa\u00ad tient education to become a central priority of healthcare and think that it is appropriate to hold clinicians account\u00ad able for educating patients all the time, even for an illness as minor as the common cold. 240 Some may argue that this proposal is impractical due to the time and resources it would consume. Ultimately, ques- November, Volume 7,Number11, 2007 Health Literacy, HealthInequality tions about the strict utility of such investments in patient education are empirical questions of the cost-benefit analy\u00ad ses that would need to be evaluated in various settings. We hold that such cost-benefit analyses will need to be judged 245 within the prioritarian framework we have laid out, i.e., that the cost of organizing healthcare teams to teach-to-goal will appropriately provide more benefit for the patients with the highest risk of worse health outcomes. Furthermore, all learners have better comprehension 250 and retention of information when presented with clear, succinct messages that are reiterated (Coyne et al. 2003; Flory and Emanuel 2004).While simple communication and confirming comprehension will help patients with limited literacy more than it will help patients without limited lit\u00ad 255 eracy, there is little downside in reorienting the system for limited literacy. Not only will patients' self-management skills improve, but also, patients may learn that that their providers really care about the specific tasks, which may promote adherence. 260 TECHNOLOGY-SUPPORTED COMMUNICATION Oursecond proposal calls for developing and implementing communication technology models that promote meaning\u00ad ful communication and are successful for people with lim\u00ad ited health literacy. The present healthcare system was de\u00ad 265 signed by physicians who fashioned a medical system that works best for users who think, talk, and act like physicians. The dominant iatroculture assumes the average healthcare Q3 user reads, writes, and thinks at a highly sophisticated level in which the spoken and written word are used to commu\u00ad 270 nicate complex medical and legal information. The call for improved communication in medicine is hardly new. The medical literature is replete with stud\u00ad ies showing the benefits of plain simplified language in the medical setting. This movement also calls attention to 275 needed improvements in training health care providers in communication and patient education as well as the need to invest in a multilevel team approach to educate patients, especially in the context of chronic disease where improve\u00ad ment in outcomes is closely linked to self-management 280 (Paasche-Orlow et al. 2006). However, the complex ideas that users of the healthcare system must understand, such as advance care planning, medication regimens, and medical decision-making, may not be optimally explained simply with verbal or written 285 communication. These complex ideas can be facilitated by pictures, video, multimedia and other decision aids beyond the written and spoken word (Barry 2002;Woolf et al. 2005). We have successfully piloted a video to help patients with limited health literacy better envision and understand hy\u00ad 290 pothetical health states such as dementia (Volandes et al. 2006). Other health information technologies, such as au\u00ad tomated phone systems (Friedman et al. 1996; Migneault et al. 2006; Rubin et al. 2006), and automated computer in\u00ad terfaces such as animated embodied-conversational agents 295 (Bickmore et al. 2005;Bickmore and Giorgino 2006; Hahn et al. 2004), are currently being ajob 3 AJRcls September 11, 2007 17;11 TheAmerican Journal ofBioethies refined and tested in intervention studies for patients with limited health literacy. 300 Although there has been a slow rise in the number of ar\u00ad ticles promoting innovative media, there needs to be a con\u00ad certed effort on the part of the healthcare system to invest and develop technologies that better promote meaningful communication. Care is needed, however, in how new com\u00ad 305 munication technologies are implemented. Patients with limited health literacy may have limited access to newer technologies. While well designed and tested systems with simplified user interfaces have the potential to improve healthcare for people with limited health literacy, failure 310 to ensure access to all and a lack of focus on how such sys\u00ad tems will be used by people with limited health literacy could result in health information technologies that exacer\u00ad bate inequalities in the healthcare system. Some may argue that developing technology platforms 315 to promote meaningful communication is too expensive in an already overly expensive healthcare system that is approaching 15% of the United States Gross Domestic Product. However, the rapidly decreasing price of digital technology and the increasing availability of web-based 320 informational systems make the implementation and de\u00ad velopment of new technology feasible. Ideally, this tech\u00ad nology should be tested for efficacy and cost/benefit but there is reason to think that technology platforms may work as well or surpass healthcare providers. Technology plat\u00ad 325 forms are highly efficient and, unlike physicians, deliver what they are designed to deliver with high fidelity. Fur\u00ad thermore, such systems may be used to collect, store, and compare data, support self-management, as well as pro\u00ad mote and facilitate communication between patients and 330 their healthcare team. Considerations of the least well-off in the healthcare system will require creativity in alternative communication and patient education techniques that have been proven to be effective with patients who have limited health literacy. We are in a creative era of exploration in 335 health information technology. Ultimately, while the risk of unequal access is real and the difficulty people have inter\u00ad acting with new technologies needs to be overcome, health information technologies provide a real opportunity to ad\u00ad vance patient education for patients with limited health 340 literacy. A MORE JUST PAY-fOR-PERfORMANCE Payors have begun to use healthcare process measures to influence physicians' reimbursement in programs loosely referred to as pay-for-performance. This trend should be re\u00ad 345 assessed through the perspectives of health literacy and the least well-off. Currently, such financial reimbursement schemes are 'one size fits all' with respect to patient lit\u00ad eracy and for the most part, patients with limited literacy are at a distinct disadvantage compared with high liter\u00ad 350 acy patients through the lens of these various evaluative processes. The typical pay-for-performance arrangement with\u00ad holds partial compensation and then offers providers 4 ajob bonuses for appropriately measuring specific laboratory tests (e.g., cholesterol test), conducting cancer screen\u00ad 355 ing (e.g., mammography), investing in electronic medical records, and prescribing generic medications. For exam\u00ad ple, providers will get additional compensation per mem\u00ad ber per month if they meet or exceed the pre-set target for the percentage of patients with diabetes who have had a 360 hemoglobin A1C (HbAl e)test at least twice annually or the percentage of patients older than age 50 years who have un\u00ad dergone colorectal cancer screening (Rosenthal et al. 2005; Rosenthal and Frank 2006). The goal is to improve quality. However, quality is de\u00ad 365 fined in a manner that is driven by data that are easily de\u00ad rived from administrative databases, such as HhAj, blood tests or colonoscopies. Patient education is not coded, so it cannot be promoted by current programs. Furthermore, patients who refuse a test are not removed from their clin\u00ad 370 ician's score, i.e., clinicians must convince their patients to undergo colonoscopy. This design will lead clinicians away from patient education and toward marketing whatever tar\u00ad gets are currently on the scorecard. Notwithstanding the ways this arrangement generally undercuts informed con\u00ad 375 sent, patients with limited health literacy, who need more education and who are not as likely to use preventive ser\u00ad vices, will be seen more negatively as a result of pay-for\u00ad performance (Scott et al. 2002). Some pay-for-performance plans categorize providers 380 according to how well they adhere to the targets and link subscriber co-payments to the pay-for-performance tier of their primary care provider. In such a scenario, a provider might learn to view patients with limited health literacy as a professional liability that could cost all other patients 385 higher co-pays as well as give the provider a worse reputa\u00ad tion. Providers may attempt to evade penalty by avoiding patients who have lower rates of adherence to the pay-for\u00ad performance targets. Current pay-for-performance programs have been 390 shown to accrue financial benefit only to providers who do well on such measures prior to initiating the program (Rosenthal et al. 2005).Tolevel the playing field for the least fortunate users of the healthcare system, we must be will\u00ad ing to invest disproportionately more resources on patients 395 with limited literacy. To accomplish this, resources must be allocated specifically to healthcare settings that care for a disproportionate share of patients with limited literacy to hire diabetes educators, nutritionists, clinical pharmacolo\u00ad gists, and other practitioners who are dedicated to patient 400 education. It is important to note that current programs that get providers to measure HbAIc tests have not been shown to lead to improvement in the actual values of HbA le (O'Connor et al. 2005). This finding can be seen to show 405 how some of the quality measures place an inordinate focus on the wrong kinds of behavior. A shift of quality mea\u00ad sures away from items such as laboratory tests toward pa\u00ad tient education may provide incentives to interact with pa\u00ad tients in a way that will have a better chance of improving 410 outcomes. November, Volume 7, Number 11,2007 AJB.cls September 11,2007 17:11 CONCLUSION The empirical evidence is clear: limited health literacy neg\u00ad atively impacts health. We have presented three ways clin\u00ad 415 ical care and health policy can be transformed to address the needs of patients with limited literacy. We hope that these ideas can be evaluated on their merits and that they might serve as a catalyst to introduce a broad discourse on unneeded complexity in the healthcare system. This is 420 important because, in failing to meet the needs of patients with limited literacy, the healthcare system propagates a se\u00ad rious injustice. While the healthcare system may not rectify inequalities that transcend healthcare, such as inequalities in primary education, we should expect that the healthcare 425 system not exacerbate underlying injustices. Unfortunately, this is precisely the impact of the current arrangement, as limited literacy has been shown to be an underlying mech\u00ad anism of ethnic and racial health disparities (Saha 2006; Sentell and Halpin 2006). 430 Future attention and research focusing on the problem of unneeded complexity in healthcare may help ameliorate the clustering of disadvantage represented by those with limited health literacy, a population that is disproportion\u00ad ately elderly, non-white, less educated, and chronically ill. 435 As Powers and Faden (2006)point out, \"inequalities are in\u00ad teractive\" and to pursue the remedial task of aspiring for justice in the real world we need to identify through empiri\u00ad calmethods how\"inequalities ofonekind begetinequalities Q4 of another emerging literature on health lit\u00ad 440 eracy is providing such evidence. Not to focus attention on patients with limited literacy is to neglect a fundamental obligation of the healthcare system to its most vulnerable consti tuents. REFERENCES 445 Baker, D. W. 2006.

Emily C. Williams, Nicholas J. Horton, Jeffrey H. Samet, and Richard Saitz Background: Assessing readiness to change is recommended as part of brief interventions for patients with unhealthy alcohol use. However, the utility and predictive validity of readiness measureshave not been well established. Methods: In a prospective cohort study, we assessed primary care patients with unhealthy alcohol use (past-month drinking of risky amounts, or any amount and an afrmative response to CAGEalcohol screening questionnaire) and reassessed them 6 months later. At study entry, we assessedreadiness to change using 1 multi-item measure of stage of change, and 5 single-item measures (readi-ness per se, importance of changing, condence in ability to change, intention to cut down, intention to abstain). Outcomes included alcohol consumption and alcohol-related consequences. Multivaria- ble regression models were t for each measure of readiness and each outcome. Results: Of 312 patients with unhealthy alcohol use, 228 (73%) were assessed at study entry and 6 months later and had complete data. Among readiness measures, only condence and intention toabstain (1 point changes on single-item measures) were associated with consumption 6 months later:less heavy episodic drinking [adjusted odds 0.80-0.98 and 0.79-1.00 and AOR 0.78,0.62-0.98, respectively). Intention to also associated with more abstinence (AOR 1.43,1.09-1.88). Single-item measures of readiness, importance, and intention to cut down were signi-cantly associated with higher odds of alcohol consequences. Greater condence (single item) wasassociated with a lower odds of any consequences (AOR 0.88, 0.79-0.98). Conclusions: Greater readiness, as measured by several brief assessments, was associated with more consequences and was not predictive of consumption. However, assessing condence inthe ability to change one's alcohol use may have a role in predicting subsequent decreases in bothconsumption and consequences in primary care patients. Key Words: Alcohol, Alcohol Use, Readiness to Change. UNHEALTHY ALCOHOL USE is common and accounts for substantial morbidity and mortality (Saitz, 2005). Primary care visits are an opportune time to detect and prevent unhealthy alcohol use and related con-sequences (Barnes and Samet, 1997). Brief counselinginterventions in primary care settings reduce drinking inpatients with unhealthy alcohol use identied by screening(Ballesteros, et al., 2004; Bertholet et al., 2005; Bien et 2002; Poikolainen,1999; Whitlock et al., 2004; Wilk et al., 1997). Therefore, practice guidelines recommend routine alcohol screening in primary care settings, followed by evidence-based briefalcohol counseling interventions for patients who screenpositive (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alco-holism, U.S. Department of Health and Human Servicesand National Institute of Health, 2005; U.S. PreventiveServices Task Force, 2004). Brief alcohol counseling interventions generally include assessment, feedback, advice, and goal setting (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2004). Although theirmechanisms of action are not entirely known, the effect-iveness of these interventions relates to their patientcenteredness (Miller and Rollnick, 2002; Miller et al.,From the Health Services Research & Development, VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, Washington (ECW); the Center of Excel- lence in Substance Abuse Treatment and Education, VA Puget SoundHealth Care System, Seattle, Washington (ECW); The Departments of Medicine and Health Services, the Graduate School of Public Health, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington (ECW); the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Smith College, Northampton, Massachu- setts (NJH); the Clinical Addiction Research and Education Unit, Section of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine and Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts (JHS, RS); Youth Alcohol Prevention Center and Department of Epide- miology, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachu- setts (RS); the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts (JHS).

Patient readiness can be con- ceptualized in several ways (Prochaska et al., 1997) andis often framed by Prochaska and DiClemente's trans-theoretical model (TTM), which describes a patients'progression through 5 (sometimes modied to 3) discretestages of change (Prochaska et al., 1992). A differentfacet of readiness is motivation for change, which includescondence in the ability to succeed (often called self- efcacy; Bandura, 1990) and importance or value placed on changing (Butler et al., 1996; Miller and Rollnick,2002). To help tailor brief alcohol counseling interventions and predict subsequent drinking outcomes, use of measures ofpatients' readiness to change is recommended in clinicalpractice (Barnes and Samet, 1997; Dent et al., 1995;DiClemente et 1993; Samet and O'Connor, 1998; Samet et al., 1996). Many measures exist to assess patient readiness tochange drinking. However, some are long, limiting theiruse in general healthcare settings where there are multiplepreventive care agendas and limited time (Yarnall et al.,2003). An example is the SOCRATES, whose characteris-tics have been well described (Maisto et al., 1999; Millerand Tonigan, 1996), but whose 20-item scale may preclude its routine clinical use in these settings. An example of a shorter, but still fairly long, measure is the 12-item readi-ness to change questionnaire (RTCQ; Rollnick et al.,1992), which characterizes patients into stages of changebased on the TTM (Prochaska and Norcross, 2001). Othershorter measures, if validated, might be used in clinicalsettings where time constraints are an issue. Examplesinclude single-measure visual analogue scales (Miller and Rollnick, 2002), and a 3-item questionnaire designed to guide brief alcohol counseling interventions in primarycare (Epler et al., 2005; Williams et al., 2006). Whether aspects of readiness are associated with alcohol consumption or consequences for primary care patientswith unhealthy alcohol use has not been well described(Riemsma et al., 2002). Self-efcacy is thought to be animportant predictor of behavior change (Miller and Rollnick, 2002) and has been associated with better treat- ment outcomes (Demmel et al., 2004; Moos and Moos,2006) and with decreased alcohol consumption and con-sequences (Blume et al., 2003) in patients who meetdiagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorders. Further, theRTCQ has been predictive of subsequent alcohol con-sumption in general hospital inpatients (Heather et al.,1993). Based on these previous studies, we hypothesized that brief readiness measures predict alcohol consump- tion and consequences among primary care patientswith unhealthy alcohol use identied by screening.This prospective cohort study assessed the concurrentvalidity and the ability of multiple measures of readinessto change drinking to predict alcohol consumption and consequences. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Design A prospective cohort of adult primary care patients with unhealthy alcohol use were enrolled in a randomized trial of provid- ing patients' alcohol screening results to physicians (Saitz et al., 2003). Randomization for this trial occurred at the physician level,and analyses were adjusted for clustering of patients within physi- cians. This study represents a secondary analysis of data collected during this trial. The study was approved by the institutional reviewboard of the Boston University Medical Center. Subjects providedinformed consent to participate in the study and were told that their physician might be given the results of alcohol screening questions. Participants' privacy was further protected with a Certicate ofCondentiality obtained from the Federal government. Participants Patients were screened using a self-administered questionnaire (Aertgeerts et al., 2000) available in both Spanish and English, which included the CAGE alcohol screening questions (modied to refer to the past year rather than lifetime) and 3 questions about past-monthquantity and frequency of drinking. Patients were eligible for thestudy if they screened positive for unhealthy alcohol use, either by answering yes to 1 or more of the CAGE questions and drinking any alcohol in the past month or by reporting drinking risky amounts inresponse to 3 questions about past-month quantity and frequency of consumption (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, U.S. Department of Health and Human services, and NationalInstitute of Health, 2003). Risky amounts were dened in accord-ance with National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism recommendations (no more than 4 standard drinks per occasion or 14 per week for men, and no more than 3 per occasion or 7 per weekfor women; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism,1995). A more detailed description of study recruitment and the trial methods has been reported previously (Saitz et al., 2003). To be eligible for the current analysis, subjects had to have completed6 months of follow-up and to have completed assessments on thevariables of interest. Assessments Subjects were interviewed by a trained staff researcher in person at study entry both before and after meeting with their physician. Six months later, they were interviewed again, this time by phone.Demographic characteristics were assessed at study entry. Both assessments included readiness, alcohol consumption, and alcohol use consequence measures. Subjects were also asked about medicalcomorbidity (Charlson et al., 1987; Katz et al., 1996), psychiatriccomorbidity (Spitzer et al., 1994; Whooley et al., 1997), and tobacco and other drug use. Assessments were completed in either Spanish or English. All questions not available in Spanish (Saitz et al., 1999)were translated from English, back-translated, and checked foraccuracy. Measures of readiness to change included 5 single questions and 1 validated scale. On the screening questionnaire, patients wereasked to respond, on a scale of 0 to 10, to ''how ready are you tochange your drinking habits?'' A response of 0 indicated ''I don't drink; doesn't apply.'' Responses of 1 to 10 corresponded to not ready to ready. After subjects provided consent but before the phy-sician visit, they were asked to report, on a scale of 1 to 10, the importance of changing and condence in their ability to change (Miller and Rollnick, 2002). Response options for these questions429 READINESS TO CHANGE AND ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND CONSEQUENCESwere scaled from 1 to 10, corresponding to not important or con- dent to very important or condent. At this time, subjects were also assessed with the validated RTCQ, which asks patients for scaled responses (5-point Likert scale, strongly disagree to strongly agree)to 12 statements. This instrument has demonstrated satisfactory test-retest reliability (Rollnick et al., 1992) and categorizes patients into precontemplation, contemplation, and action groups (Heatherand Rollnick, 2000) based on the transtheoretical model (Prochaskaand DiClemente, 1983). Finally, after the visit with the physician, subjects were asked to indicate their agreement with statements of intention to cut down and abstain using a 5-point categorized LikertScale with response options ranging from ''strongly disagree'' to''strongly agree'' and corresponding numerical scores from 1 to 5. Alcohol consumption was assessed at the follow-up interview using the validated 30-day timeline followback (Sobell et al., 1996),which assesses the number of drinks consumed on each of the past 30 days. Alcohol consequences in the past 3 months were measured using the Short Inventory of Problems, Version 2 Revised (SIP-2R;Miller et al., 1995). This instrument includes 6 items that assessoccurrence and frequency of consequences (response options include ''never,'' ''once or a few times,'' ''once or twice a week,'' ''daily or almost daily'') and 9 items that assess the occurrence and extent ofconsequences (response options include ''not quences include (because of drinking) being unhappy, not eating properly, failing to do what is expected, feeling guilty or ashamed,harming physical health, damaging friendships or familiar relation-ships, or having an accident while drinking. Predictor Variables\u2014Readiness to Change Readiness to change predictor variables were 5 single-item continuous measures and 1 multi-item categorical questionnaire. Single-item continuous measures included: (1) readiness to change(1-10), (2) importance of changing (1-10), (3) condence in ability to change (1-10), (4) intention to cut down (1-5), and (5) intention to abstain (1-5). Additionally, stages of change (precontemplation,contemplation, or action) derived from the RTCQ were used as pre-dictor variables (Heather and Rollnick, 2000). Outcomes\u2014Alcohol Consumption and Consequences Three 30-day alcohol consumption dichotomous outcome variables were derived from the timeline followback measure. They included: (1) abstinence, (2) heavy episodic drinking, dened as 43 drinks on an occasion for women or participants over age 65 and 44 drinks per occasion for men, and (3) drinking risky amounts dened as either heavy episodic drinking (dened previously) or exceeding typical weekly limits ( 47 drinks per week for women or those 465 years of age and 414 per week for men). The alcohol consequences outcome measure was derived from the SIP-2R and was dichotomous (any of 15 consequences vs none)because 40% of subjects reported no consequences. Analyses Descriptive analyses were completed for all participating subjects. To assess concurrent validity, the mean scores on each single-item measure were obtained for patients in each stage of change as iden- tied by the RTCQ, and differences in means were tested using a 2-degree of freedom test. Pearson's correlation coefcients were usedto compare single-item measures of readiness. To assess predictive validity, multivariable regression models were t for each predictor and each outcome. No adjustment for multiplecomparisons was undertaken. Models were adjusted for clustering within physician, randomization group, physician training (i.e., resi- dent physician or not), patient sex, race, medical comorbidity, andeducation (high school completed). For dichotomous outcomes, generalized estimating equation regression models with working independence correlation structure and empirical variance estimators were t (Zeger and Liang, 1986). Consequence models were adjustedfor consequences at study entry; consumption models were adjusted for consumption at study entry. All analyses were carried out using SAS/STAT Version 8.2 (SAS/STAT sSoftware, 2001). RESULTS Among 4,143 patients who were approached to partici- pate, 182 (4%) did not complete the self-administeredscreening questionnaire, and 565 of the remaining 3,961(14%) screened positive for unhealthy alcohol use. Among those patients, 312 (55%) were enrolled in the study. As published previously, the subjects enrolled differed fromthose who were eligible but not enrolled in readiness tochange drinking (single-item measure from screening,mean score 5.5 vs 4.9, respectively) and alcohol consump-tion (4.5 vs 3.4 drinks per drinking day, respectively; Saitzet al., 2003). Two hundred thirty-ve enrolled subjectscompleted 6 months of follow-up, and 228/312 (73%) of these subjects had complete data on all variables of interest for analysis, with the exception of the single-item measureof readiness to change ( n5207). Among these 228 sub- jects, 128 (56%) saw physicians who had been randomizedto receive the intervention (alcohol screening results). Thebaseline characteristics of subjects with complete data at6 months compared with subjects enrolled but lost to fol-low-up or with incomplete data were not significantly different, with the exception of education. Graduation from high school was more common in subjects with com-plete data (68 vs 52%, p50.01). The characteristics of the 228 subjects who were includ- ed in this analytic cohort are displayed in Table 1. Subjectswere mostly male and African American, with a mean ageof 44. Over two-thirds (68%) reported alcohol-related con-sequences, and subjects consumed 6 drinks per drinking day on average. Most subjects (71%) indicated some readiness to change\u2014118 (52%) were classied in the action and 43(19%) in the contemplation stage of change by the RTCQ.Self-reported readiness on single-item readiness measureswas generally high. On these measures with possible scoresranging from 1 to 10, the mean scores for readiness,importance, and condence were 5.10 (SD 3.19), 6.00 (SD 3.61), and 8.00 (SD 2.56), respectively. For instruments ranging from 1 to 5, the mean scores for intention to cutdown and intention to abstain were 3.43 (SD 1.05) and2.62 (SD 1.09), respectively. Mean condence scores were lower for patients categor- ized in Contemplation than for those in other stagesaccording to the RTCQ. Patients categorized by theRTCQ as being in precontemplation had lower mean scores on the other single-item readiness measures, and the mean scores tended to increase through the stages(from precontemplation to action), although the relation-430 WILLIAMS ET AL.ship was less consistent across contemplation and action (Table 2a). In addition, readiness, importance, and inten- tion appeared to be positively correlated, but condence was not highly correlated with readiness, importance, orintentions (Table 2b). Both condence (scale from 1 to 10) and intention to abstain (5-point Likert scale) were associated with reducedconsumption: less heavy [adjusted oddsratio was also associat-ed with more abstinence (AOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.09-1.88).No other readiness measures were associated with alcoholconsumption. All readiness measures, except intentionto abstain and stage of change derived from the RTCQ,were significantly associated with later alcohol-relatedconsequences. Readiness, importance, and intention to cut down were positively associated with the occurrenceof consequences at follow-up despite controlling for thepresence of consequences at study entry. More condence,however, was associated with lower odds of any conse- quences (AOR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79, 0.98). DISCUSSION In this study of adult primary care patients who screened positive for unhealthy alcohol use, patients' readiness tochange drinking was generally high, regardless of themeasure used. The measures exhibited a fair amount ofconcurrent validity, but notably, the measure of con-dence was not highly correlated with the other measures. However, most measures of readiness were not associated with subsequent alcohol consumption. Condence in abil-ity to change drinking and intention to abstain were bothassociated with lower odds of heavy episodic drinking anddrinking risky amounts. Additionally, a single-item meas-uring condence to change was associated with lower oddsof alcohol consequences, but other measures of readiness(single-item measures of readiness, importance of chan- ging, and intention to cut down) were associated with more, not fewer, alcohol-related adverse consequences atfollow-up. It is well known that consequences and discrepancies between values and actions related to drinking often drivepeople toward change (Cunningham et al., 2005; Isenhartet al., 1998; Kahler, 2001; Sobell et al., 1993). As such, it islikely that the observed association between readiness and consequences reflects an effect cause relationship rather than cause effect, despite the use of a prospective analysisadjusting for consequences reported at study entry. Inother words, people who experience more drinking conse-quences will report greater readiness (Kahler, 2001;Strecher et al., 1994; Williams et al., 2006). However,patients with long-standing alcohol problems and relatedconsequences report low self-efcacy (Saxon et al., 2005). The strong relationship between readiness and consequen- ces creates difculties for the clinical utility or predictiveability of many measures of readiness, and it is here thatTable 1.

Increasing consequences may lead patients to considerchange more strongly, which would result in a higherreport of readiness from a patient. However, this may notreflect a patient's self-perception of his/her ability to makechange. In this study, the measure of self-efcacy (condence to change drinking) was not correlated with the other meas- ures of readiness. Unlike the other readiness measures, condence was associated with fewer consequences at fol- low-up. This nding is consistent with studies in otherpopulations, which have shown that self-efcacy is associ-ated with improved outcomes (Blumeet al., Moosand Moos, 2006) and suggests that this simple measuremay be a useful tool for predicting alcohol consumption and future alcohol consequences in primary care patients with unhealthy alcohol use. Also noteworthy among our ndings was that the RTCQ did not predict subsequent alcohol consumptionor consequences. Heather et al. (1993) evaluated the pre-dictive validity of the RTCQ and found that stage ofchange was a significant predictor of reduced drinkingat follow-up. That study was conducted among hospital inpatients, 18% of whom were in the hospital for conditions related to their drinking. To the extent thathospitalizations may be ''teachable moments,'' thesepatients could have experienced heightened readiness tochange and increased motivation to change in the monthsfollowing hospitalization (McBride et al., 2003). Whetherthe readiness measures evaluated in the current studywould have similar results in hospitalized patients is unknown. These divergent ndings are also interesting in the con- text of increasing evidence that stage-of-change-basedbehavioral interventions delivered in medical care settingsmay not be more effective than those that do not specic-ally focus on stage of change (Riemsma et al., 2003; Van Sluijs et al., 2004). Stage-based interventions have beenadvocated for unhealthy alcohol use (Barnes and Samet,1997; Burge and Schneider, 1999; Butler et 1992; Samet and O'Connor, 1998;Samet et al., 1996). But because time is limited in busyclinical settings (Richmond and Mendelsohn, 1998), our nding that the RTCQ was not associated with subsequent alcohol-related outcomes suggests that identifying apatient's stage of change may not be essential, particu-larly if the purpose is to predict outcomes. However, theremay still be clinical value to assessing readiness to changeas part of a conversation or counseling strategy thatemphasizes a patient centeredness when addressingunhealthy alcohol use (Butler et al., 1996; Miller et al., 1993). Given this study's nding that condence is predic- tive of positive outcomes, interventions that have supportof self-efcacy or condence as primary or central compo-nents, such as motivational interviewing (Miller andRollnick, 2002), might have greater utility than stage-based interventions for promoting behavior change. Our study has several limitations. The patients in this cohort were in a clinical trial at an urban medical center, which may limit the generalizability of our ndings. How- ever, there is no reason to believe that rural or suburbanpatients with unhealthy alcohol use would have a differentrelationship between readiness to change and subsequentdrinking outcomes. Further, participants reported greaterreadiness to change and tended to drink more than eligiblepatients who were not enrolled. It is possible that our nd-ings would not apply to patients who are slightly less ready or drink slightly less, but it is not clear what importance these small differences in characteristics would have.Additionally, loss to follow-up may have resulted in bias.However, the analytic sample with complete data was sim-ilar to subjects lost to follow-up or with incomplete data.Table 3.

Consequenc e models were adjusted for consequences at study entry; consumption models were adjusted for consumption at study entry. AOR, adjusted odds ratio. Results in bold are statistically significant ( p/C200.05).432 WILLIAMS ET AL.Another limitation may be that, because patients were informed that screening results would be provided to theirclinicians, they may not have been entirely honest in their responses after the initial readiness assessment that occurred during screening. While possible, this scenarioseems unlikely because patients were informed about thissharing and that honest responses were desired. They thenhad a choice to participate in the study or not if they didnot want results shared (or for any other reason). Becauseof the known limits of sensitivity of validated screeningtools, we may have missed some patients with unhealthy alcohol use, but this would not have been because of anticipation of shared results as subjects were not informedof this possibility until after screening. Additionally, it isnot clear that the relationship between readiness and con-sumption and consequences would have differed in thosepatients from the relationship seen in study subjects. Fur-ther, the fact that patients were assessed for most readinessmeasures before visits with clinicians but were assessed for their intentions to cut down and abstain after may have some impact on the predictive validity of these measures.However, we controlled for randomization group toaddress this possible effect. Finally, it is possible that theeffects of readiness to change as a predictor of subsequentdrinking behavior may be mediated or moderated byother factors such as self-efcacy or personal values. Forexample, if either readiness or condence are lacking, then little behavior change might be expected, whereas the presence of readiness coupled with a high level of con-dence might be expected to predict behavior change. Thecurrent analyses do not directly address this issue, whichcould be addressed with further research. Despite these limitations, this study has noteworthy strengths. We prospectively evaluated multiple measuresand facets of readiness to change and their associations with diverse drinking outcomes. Although other brief measures of readiness exist (Epler et al., 2005; LaBrieet al., 2005), their predictive validity is not known. Fur-ther, this study evaluates the predictive validity of theRTCQ in a primary care setting, where brief interventionsfor unhealthy alcohol use are recommended. In summary, among primary care patients with unhealthy alcohol use, many brief measures of readiness to change may play an important role in discussions of a patient's alcohol use during brief intervention, especiallygiven that physicians have exhibited noteworthy discom-fort in alcohol-related discussions (McCormick et al.,2006). However, in this study, most measures did notappear to predict meaningfully later alcohol consumptionor decreases in consequences. Tools to assess readiness tochange drinking must be evaluated for their predictive ability as well as their clinical utility, as these measures do not all consistently predict change. Intention to abstainand condence in ability to change (self-efcacy) bothshowed promise for predicting change as they were bothassociated with subsequent improvements in drinkingoutcomes. Condence, as measured by a single item, was additionally associated with fewer alcohol-related conse-quences at follow-up. As such, assessing condence in ability to change drinking may be useful as part of brief counseling interventions for unhealthy alcohol use inprimary care settings as it holds the most promise for pre-dicting decreases in both consumption and consequences.

Separate analyses were performed for both the total sample and a subgroup with problem opioid use.Results: Lifetime prevalence for any OD was 30.9% (145/470) in the total sample and 42.3% (85/201) in patients with opioid problems. During the 2-year follow-up, OD was estimated to occur in 16.9% of the total sample and 26.7% of the opioid problem subgroup, with new-onset (incidence)OD estimated at 5.7% and 11.0%, respectively. Factors associated with an increased hazard of OD in both samples included white race, moredepressive symptoms, and prior OD regardless of intent. Prior suicidal ideation or attempt was not associated with future OD.Conclusions: Findings underscore both the high prevalence of non-fatal OD among detoxication patients especially opioid users, and the potency of prior OD as a risk factor for future OD. Depressive symptoms, a modiable risk factor, may represent a potential intervention target to preventOD, including some \"unintentional\" ODs.\u00a9 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Poisoning, which include overdoses (ODs) on illicit drugs, alcohol, andmedications, is the leading cause of injury death for indi-viduals age 35-44 and the third leading cause of injurydeath overall, trailing motor vehicle accidents and rearm-related deaths. Poisoning fatalities in 11 states increased56% from 1990 to 2001, and unintentional poisonings, espe- /H22845Preliminary results were presented at the Complexities of Co-occurring Conditions Conference, June 23-25, 2004 in Washington, DC. Corresponding author at: McLean Hospital, 115 Mill Street, Belmont, MA 02478, USA. Tel.: +1 617 opioid-related ODs, driving the increase ( CDC, 2004 ). Opioid-related ODs have increased at an alarming rate in portions of the US ( Ballesteros et al., 2003; Landen et al., 2003; Sanford, Sorg and Greenwald, ) and other countries (Darke and Hall, 2003; Warner-Smith et al., 2001 ), and OD has surpassed HIV infection as the primary cause of death forheroin users in some areas ( Frischer et al., 1993 ). Not surpris- ingly, heroin is frequently associated with opioid-related ODs,both as a single drug and in combination with substances(CDC, 2004; Darke and Latkin, 2003 ). Much of the current scientic literature regarding opioid-related ODis based on studies focused exclusively on intravenous heroinusers conducted in Australia and Europe ( Darke and Hall, 2003 ).

Wines Jr . et al. / Drug and Alcohol Dependence 89 (2007) 161-169 prescription opioids in the US ( Compton and V olkow, 2006; Zacny et al., 2003 ) may limit the generalizability of these OD- related ndings from other countries to the US population andto populations abusing prescription opioids. Indeed, fatal drugpoisonings related to prescription opioids cocaine-related ( Paulozzi, 2006; Paulozzi et al., 2006 ). Recently, leadership at the US National Institute on Drug Abuse ( Compton and V olkow, 2006 ) stated, \" ...the rela- tionship of prescription opioid drugs to death is of increasingconcern (p. 104).\" Unintentional OD and suicide contribute considerably to the increased mortality exhibited by heroin users ( Davoli et al., 1997; Harris al., 1994; Quaglio et al., 2001 ). Although existing research clearly supports the notion that mostopioid-related ODs are considered unintentional, the reportedproportion of ( Neale, 2000 )i n some studies). Controversy also exists as to whether or not someunintentional ODs represent a type of \"hidden suicide\" Lonnqvist,1998 ). Fueling this debate are contradictory ndings from some studies examining the relationship between suicidal behaviorand OD ( Best et al., al., 1999 ). Several studies have also investigated the relationship between depressive symptoms and OD. Tobin and Latkin (2003) surveyed 729 opioid and cocaine users recruited from thecommunity and found a strong association between elevateddepressive symptoms and unintentional OD within the pastyear. In addition, researchers in Norway ( Ravndal and Vaglum, 1999 ) interviewed 200 mixed drug users at entry into a ther- apeutic community and again after 5 years. Although opioidsincreased unintentional OD risk, no associations of this formof OD with psychopathology including depression were found.These results appear to contrast with the study ( Tobin and Latkin, 2003 ) described above; however, the lack of an association between depression and unintentional OD may be explainedby the use of different assessments for depression administeredafter a longer time interval (5 years) and perhaps by the samplesselected (community versus treatment). Prospectively obtained data on non-fatal OD among sub- jects with diverse drug preferences are limited, especially inthe US, despite steadily increasing OD rates. In addition todetermining the prevalence and incidence of non-fatal OD ina cohort of patients initially admitted for detoxication fromheroin, cocaine or alcohol, the purpose of this prospective studywas to (1) improve our understanding of OD risk by drug type,(2) better characterize the magnitude of the risk of prior ODfor future OD, (3) examine the role of depressive symptomsand OD, and (4) explore the relationship of intent and OD. Thestudy's rst hypothesis was that OD risk varies across drug cat-egories. The second and third hypotheses were that prior ODand depressive symptoms would be associated with OD duringfollow-up.2. Methods 2.1. Design and subjects Data for this prospective cohort study of OD were obtained from subjects enrolled in the HELP (Health Evaluation and Linkage to Primary care) study, arandomized clinical trial testing the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary healthintervention to link individuals admitted for detoxication to primary medicalcare. The HELP study has been described in detail previously ( Samet et al., 2003 ). Subjects in the HELP study were recruited from an inpatient detoxica- tion unit in Boston, MA, which primarily treats uninsured or Medicaid-eligiblepatients. Eligible subjects were at least 18 years old; identied alcohol, cocaine,or heroin as their rst or second drug of choice; and lacked a primary care physi-cian. Exclusion criteria for the HELP study were as follows: (1) not English orSpanish speaking; (2) being pregnant; (3) living outside the Boston Medical Cen-ter catchment area; (4) signicant cognitive impairment; (5) unable to providethree contacts for tracking purposes; and (6) specic plans to leave the Bostonarea within the next year. Subjects were scheduled for follow-up every 6 monthsfor 2 years after study entry, and 85% (400/468) were assessed at least onceduring follow-up (two subjects died prior to follow-up). All subjects providedwritten informed consent prior to enrolling in the study, which was approvedby the Institutional Review Board at Boston University Medical Center; sub-jects were also protected by a Certicate of Condentiality from the NationalInstitutes of Health. 2.2. Assessments Standardized interviews were administered by trained research personnel at study entry (after resolution of acute withdrawal symptoms) and during follow-up. Assessments for the current study included: age; gender; race/ethnicity;homelessness (dened as having lived on the street or in a homeless shelter atleast one night during the previous 6 months); physical health status as measuredby the Short Form Health Survey, Physical Component Summary (SF-36-PCS)(Ware, 1993 ); social support from friends and family assessed by the Perceived Social Support scale (PSS) ( Procidano and Heller, 1983 ); sexual or physical abuse ( Liebschutz et al., 2002 ); depressive symptoms as measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale ( Radloff, 1977 ); and the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) ( McLellan et al., 1992 ). The ASI was used to construct indicator variables for suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, Problem Drug categories, and continuous variables for the total number of Problem Drugs and Drug Use as detailed below. 2.2.1. Lifetime suicidality assessed at detoxication (study entry). Lifetime sui- cidal ideation and lifetime suicidal attempt were assessed at study enrollmentby two questions from the Addiction Severity Index (ASI): \"Have you everattempted suicide? (include actual suicidal gestures or attempts)\" and \"Haveyou ever experienced serious thoughts of suicide? (patient seriously considereda plan for taking his/her life).\" 2.2.2. Problem drug categories assessed at detoxication (study entry). In the absence of formal research assessment of drug diagnoses (abuse or dependence),frequency of drug use was used as a marker for excessive or heavy use, verylikely problematic for people who met admission criteria for inpatient detox-ication. Problem Drug categories were constructed from the drugs listed in the ASI at the index admission for detoxication ( Wines et al., 2004 ).Prob- lem Drug for a particular substance was dened as use 3 times per week (for alcohol \"use\" means to intoxication or 3 drinks) for a year or more, or 5 or more days of use in the past 30 days (denitions based on the ASI and out-come denitions used in treatment studies) ( McLellan et al., 1992; O'Malley et al., 1992; V olpicelli et al., 1992 ). Theoretical considerations were used to combine drugs with similar pharmacologic properties for analysis, creating fourProblem Drug categories: stimulants (cocaine and amphetamines). Indicator variables for each Prob- lem Drug category were produced by combining the relevant drugs listed in the ASI. For example, if a subject met the Problem Drug denition for any ofJ.D. Wines Jr . et al. / Drug and Alcohol Dependence 89 (2007) 161-169 163 the three opioid drugs (heroin, methadone and other opioids/analgesics), then the subject would be considered to have problem opioid use (Opioid Problem Drug ), an indicator of frequent use and a proxy for opioid abuse/dependence. In addition, the total number of the 11 drugs listed on the ASI fullling the Problem Drug criteria was used to create a continuous variable. 2.2.3. Drug Use after detoxication (follow-up). Drug Use was dened as the number of days used in the past 30 days as recorded by the ASI (range, 0-30days) during follow-up ( Wines et al., 2004 ). For Problem Drug categories con- sisting of more than one drug (i.e., opioids, sedatives, stimulants), the singlemost commonly used drug by the cohort at study entry (i.e., heroin, benzodi-azepines, cocaine) was utilized to create four Drug Use variables. This 'one drug per category' approach was taken in part to minimize ambiguity regarding thenumber of days used, as it cannot be determined from the ASI whether drugsused within a category are used on the same day or on different days ( Wines et al., 2004 ). Specically, Alcohol Use was dened as the number of days of any alcohol use; Heroin, Benzodiazepine, and Cocaine Usewere dened as the number of days of each drug used. Also, as noted above, the total number ofdrugs used in the past 30 days was a continuous variable. 2.3. Outcome variables The main outcome variables for this study were lifetime OD (\"prior OD\") assessed at the detoxication unit (study entry) and time to any OD duringthe 6-month intervals (6, 12, 18 and 24 detoxication (follow-up). Lifetime OD (\"prior OD\") was ascertained at study entry by the followingquestion, \"Have you ever had a drug or alcohol OD requiring you to go to theemergency room (requiring medical attention right away)?\" OD during follow-up was dened similarly by asking subjects if they had an OD since their lastassessment. To explore the role of intent, lifetime prior OD was divided into twogroups based on intent. The rst group, \"Prior Unintentional OD,\" was denedat study entry as a positive response to the Lifetime OD question above anda negative response to the suicide attempt question from the ASI. The secondgroup, \"Prior Other OD,\" was dened at study entry as a positive response to the Lifetime OD question above and a positive response on the attempted suicidequestion. It should be noted that the \"No OD\" group contained only subjectswithout any history of OD, the \"Prior Unintentional OD\" group contained onlyindividuals with OD, and the \"Prior Other OD\" groupcould contain subjects with an unintentional (i.e., if past suicide attempt was notby OD) or intentional OD, or both types of OD. 2.4. Statistical analyses The extant scientic literature and clinical experience guided the selection of variables. Data from study entry were used to compare three groups accordingto OD history and intent (No OD, Prior Unintentional OD, and Prior Other OD)and to determine correlates of lifetime (prior) OD. Due to the increased lifetime(prior) OD risk from opioids, separate analyses were performed for both thetotal sample and the Opioid Problem Drug subgroup, which was constructed by limiting the sample to subjects meeting criteria for Opioid Problem Drug . For all analyses, age, SF-36-Physical Component Summary (PCS), PerceivedSocial Support (Family), Perceived Social Support (Friends), and depressivesymptoms (CES-D) were treated as continuous variables. For the three groupcomparisons (No OD, Prior Unintentional OD, and Prior Other OD), continuousand categorical were analyzed using ANOV A and Chi-square, respec-tively ( Tables 1 and 2 ). Post hoc tests (Duncan's method) were used to compare means of statistically signicant continuous variables for the three groupcomparisons. The rst hypothesis was tested in logistic regression models predicting lifetime (prior) OD (Section 3.2). The models contained the Problem Drug categories and potential confounders: age, gender, race, homeless status, SF-36-Physical Component Summary (PCS), Perceived Social Support (Family),Perceived Social Support (Friends), history of physical or sexual abuse, anddepressive symptoms (CES-D). Secondary analyses were conducted by replac-ing the Problem Drug categories with a single continuous variable representing the total number of drugs listed on the ASI fullling the Problem Drug criteria.

Time-to-event (survival) models were constructed from statistically or clinically signicant variables used in the cross-sectional, logistic regressionanalyses. OD rates during follow-up were based on Kaplan-Meier estimates. Thesecond and third hypotheses were tested using proportional hazards regressionmodels predicting time to rst new report of any OD during follow-up ( Table 3 ). The longitudinal models Prior Prior Unintentional OD andPrior Other OD); two time-varying covariates, recent (past 7 days) depressivesymptoms and recent (past 30 days) Drug Use ; and potential confounders: age, gender, race, homeless status, and physical or sexual abuse. The reports of ODwere interval censored (possible values were 6 months, 12 months, 18 months,24 months, or censored at last observed timepoint). Secondary analyses wereconducted by replacing the Drug Use variables with a single, continuous, time- varying, variable representing the total number of drugs with any use in the past30 days. In additional secondary analyses, lifetime (prior) suicidal ideation andlifetime (prior) suicide attempt were added to the cross-sectional and longitu-dinal models. Finally, in order to assess the robustness of our ndings relatedto depressive symptoms, several sensitivity analyses were performed: (1) time-varying variables were time lagged by one visit in order to assure the temporalordering of depressive symptoms and OD; and (2) a binary variable for depres-sive symptoms using a CES-D cutoff score of 23 (Golub et al., 2004 )w a s substituted for the continuous CES-D variable. Two-sided p< 0.05 was consid- ered statistically signicant and SAS/STAT software version 8.2 (Cary, NC) wasused to perform all analyses. 3. Results 3.1. Lifetime overdose by intent assessed at detoxication (study entry) Characteristics of the total sample ( n= 470) are depicted in Table 1 . The three groups (No OD, Prior Unintentional OD, and Prior Other OD) signicantly differed by age, gender, race,homeless status, physical health status, family social support, sexual/physical abuse, Problem Drug , and depressive symptoms (Table 1 ). Depressive symptoms were signicantly elevated in both the Prior Other OD group and the Prior Unintentional ODgroup compared to the No OD group. Characteristics of the Opioid Problem Drug subgroup (n= 201) can be found in Table 2 . Within the Opioid Prob- lem Drug subgroup, the three groups also signicantly differed by age, homeless status, sexual/physical abuse history, Problem Drug , and depressive symptoms ( Table 2 ). Although the results were not statistically signicant, gender, race, physical healthstatus, and social support-family differences were also similarto those seen in the entire cohort. Depressive symptoms wereelevated in both the Prior Other OD group and the Prior Unin-tentional OD group compared to the No OD group; however,the between the Prior Unintentional OD group andthe No OD group was not statistically signicant. 3.2. Lifetime overdose: prevalence and risk factors Lifetime prevalence for any OD (\"prior OD\") was 30.9% (145/470) in the total sample and 42.3% (85/201) for the OpioidProblem Drug subgroup. In logistic regression analysis, factors associated with lifetime (prior) OD in the total sample included:male (OR: abuse (OR: 3.95,J.D.

Here the OR represents the change for each pointincrease in the CES-D score. In a secondary analysis, priorsuicide associ-ated added to the model. The total number ofdrugs listed on the ASI that fullled the Problem Drug cri- teria was also associated (OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03-1.29). In the Opioid (OR: 1.03, 95% 1.13-4.54) were associated with lifetime (prior) OD. As in the total sample, secondary anal-ysis showed that prior suicide attempt (OR: 2.80, 95% CI:1.21-6.47), not prior suicidal ideation (OR: 1.37, CI:0.64-2.93), was associated with prior OD. The total numberofProblem Drug categories was also associated with prior OD 95% of the total sample(n= 397, 60 at least 1 OD) and 26.7% (95% CI: 19.5-33.9) of the Opioid Problem Drug subgroup ( n= 169, 40 individuals with at least 1 OD) reported an OD. Amongindividuals with a prior OD, the KM estimate was that 43.5% (95% CI: 33.7-53.3) of subjects in and 52.4% (95% Drug subgroup 70), OD'd again within 2 years after detoxi- cation. Among individuals without a prior OD, the estimated24-month incidence in the total sample ( n= 277) and the 24- month incidence in the Opioid Problem Drug subgroup of OD during the 2-year follow- up in the proportional hazards regression analysis included whiterace, past sexual abuse, less frequent cocaine use, more frequentalcohol use, recent depressive symptoms, and prior OD regard-less of intent ( Table 3 ). More frequent heroin use was marginally signicant ( p< 0.10). Interestingly, Prior Unintentional OD of future OD (HR: 95% CI:3.50-14.29). Recent 95% CI: 1.03-1.08 for each pointincrease in the CES-D score). When entered into the model,depressive symptoms 23 were associated with increased risk of OD (HR: 3.94, 95% CI: 1.88-8.24). Time lagged in loss of statistical signicance. Asecondary analysis showed that neither prior suicide attempt(HR: demonstrated that the166 J.D. Wines Jr . et al. / Drug and Alcohol Dependence 89 (2007) 161-169 total number of drugs with any use in the past 30 days was not signicantly associated with OD (HR: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.91-1.29). In the Opioid Problem Drug subgroup, white race, recent depressive symptoms, and prior OD regardless of intent ( Table 3 ) predicted OD during follow-up. Although there were no sta-tistically signicant associations between frequency of recentDrug Use (heroin use was marginally signicant) and OD, odds ratios were comparable to the Drug Use variables from the entire cohort. Prior Unintentional OD was again the CI: 1.01-1.07). When entered into the model,depressive symptoms 23 were associated with increased risk of OD (HR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.02-5.34). Notwithstanding lossof statistical signicance to power limitations, time laggedanalyses again demonstrated comparable ndings for depressivesymptoms both as a continuous (HR: Finally,the total number of drugs with any use in the past 30 days was notsignicantly associated with OD (HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.93-1.41). 4. Discussion Findings about these detoxication unit patients provide insight regarding OD as a leading cause of death among thosewith alcohol and other drug problems. Self-reports revealed thehigh prevalence of OD in detoxication patients users (42%). Risk factors for OD weresimilar for the total sample and the Opioid Problem Drug sub- group, suggesting that some OD risk-identication efforts (e.g.,screening for depressive symptoms) could apply universally topatients admitted for detoxication. This study extends previousresearch by demonstrating that prior OD among detoxicationpatients is a strong predictor of future OD. It is also noteworthythat the association of elevated depressive symptoms and OD,noted previously in a retrospective study of a community sam-ple (Tobin and Latkin, 2003 ), was observed prospectively in our treatment population. Overall, these data suggest that some ODconsidered \"accidental\" may not be completely unintentional. OD is a common occurrence among detoxication patients in general ( Ravndal and Vaglum, al., 2001 ). Our denition of OD, which can be applied to any drug withan OD risk, has face validity ( Powis et al., 1999 ) and by requir- ing emergency medical treatment suggests that non-fatal ODresults in considerable service utilization and healthcare cost.However, direct comparison to studies using other OD deni-tions drug-specic rates after detoxication in our study aresimilar to the study by Ravndal and Vaglum (1999) , which also sampled patients with diverse drug preferences (17% over 2years versus 29% over 5 years). Additionally, OD rates afterdischarge for the Opioid Problem Drug subgroup (27% over 2years) are comparable to the estimated annual rates for non-fatal OD among heroin users in Australia, which range from 19% to30% ( Darke et al., 2003 ). While it should be emphasized that the degree to which risk factors for non-fatal and fatal OD overlap iscurrently unknown ( Powis et al., 1999 ), the increased risk of OD from opioids is consistent with some toxicology studies of fatalOD ( Cofn et al., 2003; Gossop et al., 2002 ). Opioids' ability to depress the respiratory center in the brain is well known and mostlikely represents the mechanisms of action for opioid-related OD(White and Irvine, 1999 ). Prior suicide attempt is one of the strongest predictors of both future suicide attempt ( Preuss et al., 2003; Wines et al., 2004 ) and completed suicide ( Harris and Barraclough, 1997 ); however, less is known regarding quantifying the risk of priornon-fatal OD (elevated six-fold in our study) on future non-fatalOD. Results are consistent with a retrospective study of 312injection drug users that found that each OD increased the riskof having another OD ( Powis 1999 ). Our nding of Prior Unintentional OD as the strongest predictor of OD was some-what unexpected, but important, as it appears to reinforce boththe preventable nature of OD and the need for effective inter-ventions in high-risk individuals with a history of OD ( Powis et al., 1999 ). The frequency of multiple drug use in our cohort and results from both the Problem Drug and Drug Use variables are generally consistent with the polydrug theory ( Darke and Zador, 1996 ndings from a case-crossover study by Dietze et al. (2005) . That stimulants may be associated with less risk should be interpreted with caution asstimulants like cocaine have been associated with both non-fatal(Kaye and Darke, 2004 ) and fatal OD ( Cofn et al., 2003 ), and the effect measure (odds ratio) for stimulants in our study rep-resents a relative comparison to other drugs, not a comparisonto a no drug control. Our ndings regarding the association of depressive symp- toms and OD are very similar to the study by Tobin and Latkin (2003) . Although depressive symptoms, a modiable risk fac- tor, may represent a potential intervention target to preventOD, their exact role remains uncertain, as several explanationsmay account for the association between depressive symptomsand OD. Specically, depressive symptoms may increase inthe aftermath of an OD; however, several studies have shownthat these symptoms actually improve after an intentional OD(Jack and Williams, 1991; Sarfati et al., 2003 ). Chronically ele- vated depressive symptoms may also form a trait-risk for OD,yet depressive symptoms were not increased among individu-als with an OD that occurred more than a year previous ( Tobin and Latkin, 2003 ). In addition, individuals may indulge in more risky drug use as an attempt to al., 2004 ), resulting from a mood disorder or other source (e.g., medical illness) ( DSM-IV , 1994; Raimo and Schuckit, 1998 ). Conversely, use may cause the depressive symptoms (substance-induced depression) ( Brown and Schuckit, 1988; Ries et al., 2001 ) leading to the OD ( Preuss et al., 2003; Wines et al., 2004 ). Individuals relapsing after extended periods of abstinence may experience extreme guilt and hopelessness(abstinence violation effect) ( Marlatt, 1985 ) that when coupledJ.D. Wines Jr . et al. / Drug and Alcohol Dependence 89 (2007) 161-169 167 with decreased drug tolerance ( Strang et al., 2003 ) may sub- stantially enhance the risk of OD. Finally, acute life stressors(e.g., relationship disruptions) that have been associated withOD ( Neale and Robertson, 2005 ) could conceivably be mediated by depressive symptoms ( Hammen et al., 1986 ). Regardless of their cause, abrupt increases in depressive symptoms occurringjust prior to the OD strongly argues that worsening dysphoriamay lie on a causal pathway for OD and as such represent a primeintervention target. Determining whether these transient moodstates can trigger an OD or if they are related to some other fac-tor outside the causal pathway requires further research, perhapsusing a case-crossover design which is capable of quantifyingthe impact of rapid mood shifts ( Mittleman et al., 1995 ). In light of our study results, it is noteworthy that some inves- tigators have argued that depression can be an implicit markerof intent for suicide ( Rosenberg et al., 1988 ). In addition, sev- that intent for OD may lie on a continuum, and we found some indirect support forthis theory. In the Prior Unintentional OD group, the propor-tion of patients with a sexual abuse history, a well-known riskfactor for suicidal behavior ( Molnar et al., 2001 ), was higher than the No OD group, but lower than the Prior Other ODgroup, which almost certainly contained some subjects withintentional ODs. Depressive symptoms and perceived familysupport were similarly distributed. Notably, a denition of asuicide attempt commonly used in the US requires that the self-injurious behavior occur with some \"nonzero\" level of intent tokill oneself ( O'Carroll et al., 1996 ). Given the importance of the accurate determination of intent, rigorously designed studies ofindividuals with severe opioid-related OD, using standardizedsuicide-related assessments are needed to further character-ize drug-related OD, develop more sensitive intent scales, andexplore the notion of a continuum of intent. Despite several strengths of our study including the longi- tudinal design utilizing a relatively large, diverse cohort andtime-to-event analyses, there are some important limitations.First, our denition of OD has both disadvantages and advan-tages. It may have underestimated the true prevalence andincidence of OD as a substantial percentage of ODs (approxi-mately 50% or more in some studies) do not result in emergencymedical treatment ( Darke et al., 1996b; Davidson et al., 2002; Powis et al., 1999 ). Furthermore, our ndings may have been influenced by selecting individuals most likely to utilize medicalservices. At the same time as our OD denition likely sam-pled more severe ODs, it probably yielded more accurate effectestimates via improved specicity of the outcome. In order tomore fully address these important issues, further methodologi-cal development and psychometric testing of differing outcomedenitions used in OD research is warranted. Second, there ispotential misclassication between the Prior Unintentional ODand Prior Other OD groups, in that some subjects in the PriorOther OD group may have had only an unintentional OD. Giventhe exploratory nature of the analyses pertaining to intent andsuicidal behavior, results should be considered preliminary andin need of replication. Third, some standardized assessmentsused refer to overlapping but not identical time periods dur-ing follow-up (e.g., CES-D: past 1 week, ASI: past 1 month), making the exact sequencing of depressive symptoms and ODdifcult to ascertain. Nonetheless, time lagged sensitivity anal-yses revealed comparable ndings. Fourth, formal diagnosticinstruments were not used to make specic substance use disor-der and major depressive disorder diagnoses; however, subjectsin our study almost certainly met substance dependence or abusecriteria given scores on addiction measurements like the ASIcoupled with admission criteria for the detoxication unit. Fifth,not all subjects were observed at all follow-up timepoints, andwe were only able to estimate time to new OD in 6-month inter-vals. Finally, results from our study of detoxication patientsmay not generalize to other populations (e.g., drug users not intreatment), yet the magnitude of OD risk from elevated depres-sive symptoms in our study was very similar (same adjusted HRand OR) to data from a community sample of drug users ( Tobin and Latkin, 2003 ). In summary, the current study illustrates the high prevalence of OD in urban detoxication patients, the potency of prior OD asa risk factor for future OD, and the potential role of worseningdepression in the etiology of OD. We also found preliminaryevidence that some \"accidental\" ODs may not be completelyunintentional. Regardless of whether or not an OD event is con-sidered intentional, our data suggest that the effective treatmentof depressive symptoms may hold potential for the preventionof OD. There is a striking lack of OD risk-recognition, pre-vention, and treatment efforts ( Cook et al., 1998; Pollini et al., 2006 ). Addiction specialists, especially those in detoxication settings, could consider screening patients with a simple ODquestion, \"Have you ever overdosed?\" The increasing rates US ( CDC, 2004; Paulozzi, 2006; Paulozzi et al., 2006 ) highlight the urgent need for research focused on this growingpublic health problem, including nationally representative, lon-gitudinal studies containing valid and reliable outcome measuresfor unintentional OD and suicidal behavior.
