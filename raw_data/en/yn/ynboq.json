As the Government has announced further plans for the gradual and selective resumption of economic activities, we would like to share with you our efforts in providing a safe clinic environment for you and your family during this period. Here are the precautionary measures we have taken across all our clinics: - Visitors must check in/out of our clinics by scanning the SafeEntry QR code provided. We highly encourage visitors to utilise the TraceTogether app or token as much as possible to check in/out of our clinics. - All persons (except children under 6) must wear a mask before entering our clinics. - Safe distancing of at least 1m must be adhered to. - Only one essential person may be allowed to accompany the patient. - Patients with fever/ respiratory symptoms must see a GP (western doctor). - With the implementation of the Vaccination-Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS) as of 13 October 2021, unvaccinated persons who wish to visit our clinics may still do so as long as - they make an appointment prior to their visit and - upon appointment confirmation, produce the appointment SMS sent by Eu Yan Sang TCM Clinic at the point of entry. Our staff reserve the right to ask that you wait outside the clinic or refuse entry to visitors who are deemed to not adhere to the above measures. We will not hesitate to call upon relevant law enforcement personnel for those who refuse to cooperate or abuse our staff. We will also continue to monitor the situation closely and keep you updated on our clinic measures via our website and social media channels. However, we also want to assure you that in the event that the situation takes a turn for the worse, we are ready. In the meantime, let us continue to practise good personal hygiene, to be socially responsible and to always look out for and support one another. If you have any questions, please contact us at enquiry@euyansang.com or call us at 1800 225 1887. Best regards, Eu Yan Sang Integrative Health Pte Ltd Management "}
