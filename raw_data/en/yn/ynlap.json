Step-by-Step Processes of Meditation To get started, you should follow this step-by-step guide - Get comfortable: First, you need to get a quiet and conducive place for your practice. Afterward, you should consider sitting on a chair, floor or mat. You can also sit with your head, neck, and back straight. However, make sure that your sitting position is not stiff. While at it, ensure that you put on some loose clothes so they don't distract you. Keep in mind, nevertheless, that there is no dress code for it. - Time yourself: Get a low-sounding alarm and time yourself. The reason is that many people tend to lose track of time.

Yes, you should keep repeating the process. - Be in control: Finally, you can make the mistake of losing concentration. Nobody's perfect!! It often happens when you worry, fear, hope or become anxious. Therefore, you need to pause and observe your mind and then return to breathing without judgment. Don't be hard on yourself whenever you feel like you derailed. It is normal to go off the track, but you have to refocus on the present by returning your breath. Just take control!
