Nearly 20 diseases studied by our researchers, including: - Infectious diseases (COVID-19, Ebola, influenza, measles and respiratory syncytial virus) - Inflammatory diseases (inflammatory bowel disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) - Sexually transmitted infections - Cardiovascular diseases and diabetes Innovative academic degree programs that combine studies in science, business and law Research centers focused on microbial pathogenesis, translational immunology and inflammation, immunity and infection National Institutes of Health-funded cooperative research centers nationwide that were created to advance development of vaccines for sexually transmitted infections. Including J. Mack Robinson College of Business, College of Law, College of Arts & Sciences and Honors College Working Together to Improve Human Health Our researchers are developing new vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics to tackle some of the world's biggest health issues. To bring these biomedical inventions to the market, they'd like to work with pharmaceutical and biotech companies, foundations, industry sponsors and donors who want to improve the health of people worldwide.
