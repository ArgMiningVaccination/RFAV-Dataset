Table 1 describes the influenza vaccines available for the 2020-21 season. New for the 2020-21 season are the quadrivalent vaccine (i.e., The Fluzone High- Dose Quadrivalent is replacing the previously available trivalent high-dose formulation, and both the quadrivalent adjuvanted vaccine (Fluad Quadrivalent) are expected to be available for the 2020-21 season.

Common abbreviations used for the various types of influenza vaccines.1 Abbreviation Vaccine IIV3 Trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine One influenza A (H3N2) virus, one influenza A (H1N1) virus, and one influenza B virus (B/Victoria trivalent inactivated influenza influenza One influenza A (H3N2) virus, one influenza A (H1N1) virus, and two influenza B viruses (B/Victoria and B/Yamagata Quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine The numerals following the letters describe the number of influenza virus hemagglutinin antigens (HA) represented in the vaccine (i.e., 3 or 4).1 Prefixes such as \"a\" or \"HD\" are used to describe some specific vaccine types, with \"a\" indicating the vaccine has an adjuvant and \"HD\" indicating the vaccine is high-dose. Influenza vaccines with an adjuvant or those that are high-dose are indicated for patients who are 65 years of age or older and data suggest that these vaccines may produce a more robust immune response compared with standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines in older adults.1 Other abbreviations indicate the manufacturing technology used such as \"cc\" for cell culture-based and \"R\" for recombinant.1 Both the \"cc\" and \"R\" influenza vaccines are made via a process that does not involve eggs and may be preferred by patients who are looking for an egg-free option. LAIV is the standard abbreviation used to describe the live attenuated influenza vaccine and may be an ideal option for age-appropriate patients (i.e., 2-49 y/o) who prefer a needle-free option. Pharmacists should be familiar with these abbreviations, as this will help with understanding the vaccine contents, manufacturing process used, and if the vaccine is indicated for a special population. Selecting between influenza vaccine formulations The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged 6 months and older who do not have contraindications.1 There is no preferential recommendation for one influenza vaccine product over another for patients for whom more than one licensed, recommended, and appropriate product is available. Providers may choose to administer any licensed, age-appropriate influenza vaccine, and have the ability to select between a variety of formulations such as the quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4), live attenuated high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4).1 Select considerations should be kept in mind when selecting between influenza vaccine formations, which are described in Table 3. The adjuvanted and high-dose formulations have been designed to provide a more robust immune response and are indicated for older patients (i.e., 65 y/o).2,3 If patients request an egg-free option, then the recombinant or cell culture-based formulations can be selected. The LAIV may be an ideal option for age-appropriate patients (i.e., 2-49 y/o) who prefer a needle-free option.4 PHARMACIST GUIDE FOR INFLUENZA VACCINE SELECTION Table 3. Influenza Vaccine Characteristics.2,3 Quadrivalent (4-component) Most influenza vaccines are quadrivalent (4-component) There are multiple vaccines with varying age indications, but influenza vaccines are available for people 6 months of age and older There is one influenza vaccine still available in a trivalent (3-component) formulation which is the trivalent adjuvanted influenza vaccine approved for people 65 years of age and olderLive Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV, 4-component) Nasal spray that contains four influenza viruses Recommended for non- pregnant individuals, 2 years through 49 years of ageRecombinant Produced using a method that does not require an egg-grown virus Indicated for adults 18 years of age and older Adjuvanted (3 and 4-component) Designed to deliver a stronger immune response Indicated for adults 65 years of age and olderHigh-dose (immune-boosting, 4-component) Designed to deliver a stronger immune response Indicated for adults 65 years of age and olderCell-based Produced with flu viruses grown in cultured cells of mammalian origin instead of in hens' eggs, developed as an alternative to the egg-based manufacturing process Indicated for people 4 years of age and older American Pharmacists AssociationPHARMACIST GUIDE FOR INFLUENZA VACCINE SELECTION CDC's Share model The CDC suggests using the SHARE method to make a strong vaccine recommendation and provide important information to help patients make informed decisions about vaccinations. In this method, the pharmacist should:2 SHARE the reasons why the influenza vaccine is right for the patient given his or her age, health status, lifestyle, occupation, or other risk factors. HIGHLIGHT positive experiences with influenza vaccines, as appropriate, to reinforce the benefits and strengthen confidence in influenza vaccination. ADDRESS patient questions and any concerns about the influenza vaccine, including side effects, safety, and vaccine effectiveness in plain and understandable language. REMIND patients that influenza vaccines protect them and their loved ones from serious influenza illness and influenza-related complications. EXPLAIN the potential costs of getting influenza, including serious health effects, time lost (such as missing work or family obligations), and financial costs.
