We 432 convened a multi -disciplinary group of international experts in anaphylaxis comprised of allergy, 433 infectious disease, emergency medicine, and front -line clinicians to systematically develop 434 recommendations regarding SARS -CoV -2 vaccine immediate allergic reactions. Medline, 435 EMBASE, Web of Science, the WHO global coronavirus database, and the grey literature 436 (inception -March 19, 2021) were systematically searched. Pair ed reviewers independently 437 selected studies addressing anaphylaxis after SARS -CoV -2 vaccination, polyethylene glycol 438 (PEG) and polysorbate allergy, and accuracy of allergy testing for SARS -CoV -2 vaccine allergy. 439 Random effects models synthesized the data t o inform recommendations based on the GRADE 440 approach, agreed upon using a modified Delphi panel . The incidence of SARS -CoV -2 vaccine 441 anaphylaxis is 7.91 cases/million (n=41,000,000 vaccinations, 442 moderate preval ence of PEG allergy is 103 cases/million (95%CI 88 -120; 2 443 studies, very low certainty), and the sensitivity for PEG skin testing is poor though specificity is 444 high (15 studies, very low certainty). We recommend vaccination over either no vaccination or 445 performing SARS -CoV -2 vaccine/excipient screening allergy testing for individuals without 446 history of a severe allergic reaction to the SARS -CoV -2 vaccine/excipient, and a shared 447 decision -making paradigm in consultation with an allergy specialist for individua ls with a history 448 of a severe allergic reaction to the SARS -CoV -2 vaccine/excipient. We recommend further 449 research to clarify SARS -CoV -2 vaccine/vaccine excipient testing utility in individuals 450 potentially allergic to SARS -CoV2 vaccines or their excipients . 451 452 Funding: none 453 454 Journal Pre-proofBackground: 455 456 Through the middle of April 2021, th e novel SARS -CoV -2 coron avirus and subsequent COVID - 457 19 (Coron avirus disease 2019) global pandemic has caused over 140 million infections and 3 458 million fatalities.1,2 COVID -19 has caused unprecedented international social and economic 459 disruption , resulting in a global economic cost in 2020 of $11 trillion, with estimates of an 460 additional cost of $10 trillion in 2021 .3 461 462 Vaccines are considered the most effect ive strategy to end the pandemic . By early 2021, 3 463 adenovirus vec tor vaccine agents, 2 mRNA vaccine agents , and 2 inactivated viral vaccine 464 agents completed phase 2/3 trials and were approved for emergency use in multiple countries .4 465 Through the middle of Ap ril 2021 , >878,900,000 doses of these vaccines have been administered 466 globally .5 These vaccines have an efficacy from 62-95% in reducing symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 467 infection, and >95% efficacy in reducing severe /critical infections .6,7 Data have also shown that 468 vaccination can reduce hospitalization. Adverse events were reported in all of the vaccine trials, 469 including hypersensitivity reactions , but no fatalities due to hypersensitivity reactions were 470 reported. During the phase 3 studies for the currently approved vaccines , there was no 471 significant difference in hypersensitivity rates between vaccine and placebo trial arms , with 0 -1 472 cases of anaphylaxis per million doses reported .7-11 473 474 On December 9, 2020, there were two severe allergic reaction s reported after administration of 475 the first 500 Pfizer -BioNTech vaccinations in the UK ; both patients responded to treatment with 476 intramuscular epinephrine.12 In response, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory 477 Agency (MHRA) temporarily recommend ed a contraindication for the Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine 478 in individuals with a history of a severe allergic reaction to any vaccine, medication or food .13 479 This recommendation was modified in early January 2021 to a contraindication only for those 480 with a history of a severe allergic reaction to the SARS -CoV -2 mRNA vaccine or vaccine 481 component /excipient (polyethylene glycol [PEG] in mRNA 482 related excipient conta ined in the adenovirus vaccines, which is considered potentially cross - 483 reactive with PEG).8,9,14 -18 Similar contraindications have been adopted in multiple other 484 countries by public health regulatory agencies and allergy/immunology societies as detailed i n 485 Figure 1.4,19-21 The evidence base for many of these recommendations remains uncertain , 486 however. 487 488 A handful of publications have detailed potentially allergic reactions to SARS -CoV -2 mRNA 489 vaccines , through the early stages of their emergency use authorization (EUA) . These reports 490 provide the specific reported symptom s, treatment, co -morbid allergic history and discussion of 491 the confidence that the reaction constituted anaphylaxis as adjudicated by U.S. Centers for 492 Disease Control ( CDC ) physicians . This was based on adjudication of the data reported to the 493 Vaccine Adverse Event Reaction System (VAERS) using the Brighton Collaboration criteria 494 (BCC) for vaccine anaphylaxis .22-25 The CDC has continued to periodically update these 495 estimates based on VA ERS data .26,27 Through the first month after the U.S. EUA for both 496 mRNA vaccines, the CDC described 66 anaphylaxis events in 17,524,676 vaccinations, or 497 approximately 3.7 events per million.26,27 One large US academic medical center reported 16 498 cases of anaphylaxis among 64,900 vaccinations (250 cases per million vaccinations) over a 2 499 month period, based on electronic health record review (by allergy investigators) of reported 500 Journal Pre-proofsymptoms within 3 days of vaccination .28 These reports all indicate that anaph ylactic reactions to 501 the SARS -CoV -2 mRNA vaccines may occur but are rare. 502 503 Reports of severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis , have prompted concern that th e new 504 mRNA vaccine platform has the potential to cause allergic reactions (including anaph ylaxis ) at a 505 greater rate than other vaccines . A lesser degree of concern is shared for adenovirus vector 506 vaccines as there is more experience with this platform. These concerns likely contribute to 507 vaccine hesitancy and must be weighed against the life -saving and disease -mitigating benefits of 508 SARS -CoV -2 vaccination. Given the lack of an established international evidence -based 509 approach to reactions attributable to these vaccines , this group of international experts in the 510 diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis has organized an evidence -based , consensus guidance 511 for the diagnosis and management of severe allergic reactions , including anaphylaxis, to SARS - 512 CoV -2 vaccines. 513 514 Methods: 515 An ad hoc panel of clinical experts from the US, Canada, UK, Europe (Ireland, Germany, Italy) , 516 South Africa, and Australia came together to synthesize the current evidence regarding severe 517 allergic reactions to the SARS -CoV -2 vaccines , and provide consensus recommendations 518 regarding the epidemiology, risk factors, assessment , and management of patient s at possible risk 519 for a severe allergic reaction to a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine from a societal perspective . The panel 520 was chosen based on expertise in anaphylaxis d iagnosis, management, and policy . The group 521 included representation of Infectious Disease clinicians, clinicians serving as front -line 522 vaccinators, and allergy specialists with prior expertise in policy related to adverse reactions to 523 vaccines for infect ious diseases . Direct financial and industry -related conflicts of interest (e.g., 524 direct or indirect involvement with the development or clinical trials related to SARS -CoV -2 525 vaccines) were not permitted and were considered disqualifying. Work unrelated t o vaccine 526 development with companies (e.g., asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, etc.) was not 527 considered either a direct or indirect conflict, but such involvement was disclosed. The 528 development of this guidance did not include any industry inp ut, funding, or financial or non - 529 financial contribution. No member of the guidance panel received honoraria or remuneration for 530 any role in the guidance development process. 531 532 A primary draft , inclusive of four focused questions, was iteratively developed by the senior 533 authors (MG, MS, EA, DG, DC, DK) using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, 534 Development, and Evaluation ( GRADE ) format for evidence synthesis from an individual 535 perspective with secondary consideration for the healthcare perspective . This draft was circulated 536 and revised/edited iteratively over multiple draft versions by the workgroup. A modified Delphi 537 panel among the members was used to rate agreement and consensus with the final 538 recommendations.29 GRADE methodology is explained in detail elsewhere ,30-32 and the full 539 details of the methods for this analysis are detailed in the EMethods . An electronic REDCap 540 survey (Research Electronic Data Capture, Nashville, TN) was sent to panel members who were 541 asked to rate their level of agree ment with recommendations (1=strongly disagree, 2= disagree, 542 3=neutral, 4=agree, 5=strongly agree).33 Additionally, panel members were encouraged to 543 submit free text comments for statements, and could choose \"not applicable \" if they did not feel 544 they had t he expertise to answer a question. A priori consensus was defined as agreement of 545 >75% for recommendations ; \"strongly disagree\" and \"disagree\" were group ed together and 546 Journal Pre-proof\"strongly agree\" and \"agree\" were grouped together. For recommendations in which cons ensus 547 was not achieved after the initial survey, an iterative discussion was undertaken with the intent to 548 resolve the key points and adjust language. Subsequent surveys were then sent to panel members 549 incorporating the de -identified responses from the prior survey with the goal of reaching 550 consensus. This process was repeated until consensus was reached or , if no consensus was 551 achieved by the 3rd round, the statement was categorized as \"no consensus reached.\" An 552 authorship statement detailing author ro les can be found in the EMethods. 553 554 Outcomes prioritized in this systematic review and meta -analysis were a naphylaxis to the 555 vaccine and vaccine excipients, a s well as the diagnostic accuracy of allergy testing to the 556 vaccine and vaccine excipients. The literature searched included (1) Global coronavirus 557 database s for country by country vaccine allergy or anaphylaxis reporting (2) national p assive 558 vaccine safety reporting systems , and (3) Pub Med/Medline and clinical trials registries related to 559 SARS -CoV -2 vaccine clinical trials and published case series related to SARS -CoV -2 vaccine 560 adverse events. Systematic reviews and literature searches (supplement) were conducted by 5 561 authors (MG, MS, DC, AWB, AB ) using Covidence (Cochrane Group, Brighton, UK ). Searches 562 and manuscript selections are detailed in the PRISMA diagrams in Figure E1. Specific inclusion 563 and exclusion criteria for each search are detailed in the EMethods. We considered but did not 564 rely on indirect evidence from similar event reportin g from other vaccines given differences in 565 the context and technology of the vaccines . However, we considered indirect evidence for 566 management strategies of those with vaccine allergy as this comprises the extant literature 567 regarding vaccine allergy, and t he acute management of severe allergic reactions, including 568 anaphylaxis , to vaccines is sufficiently similar to the experience with diagnosis and management 569 of anaphylaxis to foods, drugs and insect stings. We used the European Commission Guidance 570 for Indu stry of Adverse Drug Reactions threshold for what was considered a rare event a s 571 between 1 case per 1,000 -10,000 individuals , and very rare as < 1 case per 10,000 individuals .34 572 While not systematically reviewed, we examined vaccine efficacy as an outcome as this was 573 identified as being of major importance to patients. 574 575 We use the wording \"we recommend\" for strong recommendations and \"we suggest\" for 576 conditional recommendations. The implications of the recommendation strength are presented in 577 Table E1, the certainty of evidence in Table E2 , and the risk of bias assessment in Figures E2-4. 578 The final list of recommendations was developed by panel discussion and consensus . We present 579 the guideline statements and recommendations in Table 1. The Evidence to Deci sion Framework 580 supplement provides a summary reflection of the evidence in the context of the clinical 581 recommendation. The results of the modified Delphi panel for each recommendation are shown 582 in the Table E3 . 583 584 Results : 585 Part 1: Recommendations for indi viduals before their initial SARS -CoV -2 vaccination who 586 do not have a history of a severe allergic reaction , including anaphylaxis, to SARS -CoV -2 587 vaccine or its excipients 588 589 Question 1: What is the risk of a severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis, to a SARS - 590 CoV -2 vaccine in a patient with no history of a severe allergic reaction to a SARS -CoV -2 591 vaccine or its excipients? 592 Journal Pre-proof 593 Recommendation 1: 594 For patients with no history of a previous severe allergic r eaction to a SARS -CoV -2 vaccin e or 595 its excipients, the risk of SARS -CoV -2 vaccine -induced anaphylaxis is very rare and we 596 recommend vaccination over no vaccination based on this risk. 597 Strong Recommendation ; High Certainty of Evidence 598 599 Recommendation 2: 600 For patients with a history of a severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis , unrelated to a 601 SARS -CoV -2 vaccine or excipient , the requirement for additional observation beyond standard 602 wait time (e.g. recommended by local health authorities for the gen eral population) provides a 603 minimal absolute risk reduction in severe allergic reaction outcomes and may also contribute to 604 vaccine hesitancy . Therefore, we suggest against prolonged observation in those with a history of 605 severe allergic reactions unrelated to a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine or excipient. 606 Conditional Recommendation; Low Certainty of Evidence 607 608 Rationale 609 Systematic review and meta -analysis: 610 We searched the W orld Health Organization (WHO) Global Coronavirus database, the COVID 611 vaccine RCT living evidence map, government websites , medical literature, and press releases 612 for all estimates of anaphylaxis induced by SARS -CoV -2 vaccines up to March 19, 2021 , 613 identifying 46 total reports meeting inclusion criteria (see EMethods ).10,27,35 -74 We performed a 614 random effects meta -analysis of proportions using hierarchical logistic regression and Clopper - 615 Pearson CIs. Among 26 reports involving reported cases adjudicated to meet BCC for 616 anaphylaxis with a sample size of at least 20,000 doses, the meta -analyzed incidence of 617 anaphylaxis was 7.91 (95%CI 4.02-15.59) per million , and no 618 reported . In multivariable meta -regression, we found that reports of anaphylaxis wit hout 619 adjudication were associated with a higher reported rate of anaphylaxis (OR 5.53 , 95%CI 4.01 - 620 7.61) and compared to mRNA -based vaccines, lower rates of anaphylaxis were associated with , (OR 622 0.31,95%CI 0.18 -0.53). Findings were similar when analyzing all 46 reports ( e.g., regardless of 623 sample size). (Figure 2). Table E2 details the certainty of evidence for this estimate , and Figure 624 E2 the risk of bias assessment . 625 626 Discussion : Vaccine -related fatalities from severe allergic reactions , including anaphylaxis, are 627 very rare. Anaphylactic reactions to vaccines are historically cited at about 1.3 events per million 628 doses .75,76 A 2019 study by Su et al using the VAERS note d a cumulative incidence rate of 17 629 cases of anaphylaxis per million vaccinations from 1990 -2016.77 By comparison, the publi shed 630 rate for anaphylaxis to penicillin is 5 -10 cases per million persons,78 and in the general 631 population, drug allergy fatalities occur on the order of 0.1 to 1 event per million persons.79 632 Moreover , the estimated fatality rate from SARS -CoV -2 viral infection as of early March 2021 633 ranges from 36 .4 to 1852.7 per 1,000,000 persons in countries represented by authors on this 634 consensus document .2 Data from a physician -reported national Canadian vaccine registry 635 showed a rate of allergic reactions of any severity to vaccines of approximately 370 reactions per 636 million doses, with most being attributable to influenza vaccines .80 Slightly older data have 637 noted the estimated rate of allergic reactions of any severity (including anaphylaxis) ranges 638 between 1 -20 per million persons.75 Since SARS -CoV -2 mRNA vaccines are novel, historical 639 Journal Pre-proofestimates of severe reactions to these agents are not available. While fatality attributed to 640 SARS -CoV -2 vaccines has occurred, none has been the result of a severe allergic reaction .81 641 642 Comparing reported rates of anaphylaxis following vaccination is hampered by variation in 643 anaphylaxis definitions across regions and between organizations , as shown in Table E4. This 644 causes reactions considered to be anaphylaxis by some definitions to not be considered 645 anaphylaxis by other definitions. For example, while the BCC are the accepted standard for 646 anaphylaxis from vaccines and are used by VAERS,25 some of the cases in the MMWR reports 647 would not meet other international diagnostic criteria, such as either the N ational Institutes of 648 Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) criteria or those from the World Allergy Organization 649 (WAO). 82-85 Table 2 demonstrates how the cases published in the medical literature by the 650 CDC could be rated differently bas ed on what classification system for anaphylaxis was used.86 651 One study has compared the NIAID criteria and BCC , noting agreement of the criteria on 92/128 652 (72%) of cases, which based on a kappa statistic of 0.414 , is at the lower limit of what is 653 consider ed statistical \"moderate\" agreement.87 654 655 Importantly, VAERS is a passive case report ing system which allows the public, manufacturers, 656 and healthcare worker s to report signs and symptoms considered to be adverse events occurring 657 around vaccine administration . VAERS and other similar reporting systems in other countries 658 (e.g., Yellow Card Reporting in the UK), are not designed to determine causality or validity of 659 the event in question . Such reporting makes it difficult to definitively discern o bjective vs. 660 subjective symptoms, making it impossible to exclude other common causes that can mimic 661 symptoms of an acute allergic reaction . Thus, b ased on evidence to date, while severe allergic 662 reactions , including anaphylaxis, may occur with SARS -CoV -2 vaccination, this is a rare event 663 and represents a very low (but not completely absent ) risk according to pooled adjudicated 664 data.26 In formulating recommendations 1 and 2, we weighed the potential benefits and harms of 665 vaccinat ion against each other, along with consideration of patient values, preferences, and cost. 666 While we acknowledge that well -informed individuals may have values and preferences that 667 could lead to vaccine refusal in spite of very high -certainty of evidence r egarding the rarity of 668 severe allergic reactions to these vaccines, it was felt that most informed individuals would be 669 highly likely to choose vaccinat ion over vaccine refusal based on the very rare risk of a severe 670 allergic reaction and the benefit of vaccination in this situation. 671 672 Risk-Stratification Based on Allergic History 673 In the phase 2 and 3 clinical trials for the currently approved vaccines, participants were 674 excluded from participation if they had a known or suspected alle rgy or history of anaphylaxis, 675 urticaria, or other significant adverse reaction to the vaccine or its excipients , including 676 polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polysorbate 80 , but not for any other baseline allergic or atopic 677 condition.4,8-11,50,71,73,88 Of note, a high percentage of individuals reporting severe allergic reactions 678 to the SARS -CoV -2 mRNA vaccines in the CDC reports also ha d a self -reported history of an 679 underlying allergic condition including past medication and unrelated vaccine allergy , and were 680 female ; however, the significance and validity of these allergy diagnoses or male/female 681 differences are difficult to assess if these signify a risk signal or not .22,24,89 Allergic conditions are 682 very common in the general population and self -reported allergy is typically much higher than 683 confirmed allergy. As well, the rate of individuals with similar allergic comorbidity who 684 successfully tolerated their vaccine has not been calculated, and this is needed to properly 685 Journal Pre-proofquantify a risk ratio related to a general or specific type of allergic history (or sex). 686 Mechanistically, it is unclear why allergies to food, venom, or other non -PEG/mRNA containing 687 vaccines/medications would pose any hazard requiring additional post -vaccination observation 688 or contraind ication to vaccine administration. Therefore, pending emergence of additional data 689 showing there is a clearly increased risk relative to a control population, allergic or atopic 690 comorbidity should not be considered a risk greater than the general population for a vaccine - 691 associated allergic reaction, and inclusion of these precautions risks harm in promoting vaccine 692 hesitancy.14,18,90 There is an ongoing study that is exploring risks of SARS -CoV -2 vaccination 693 related to allergic co -morbidity (www. clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04761822) . 694 695 Shaker et al modeled the cost -effectiveness of applying broad restrictions based on underlying 696 allergic history in the US, and the impact of extended wait time as a precaution.91 Using Markov 697 modeling and microsimulation, universal vaccination was associated with a cost -savings of 698 $503,596,316 and saved 7,607 lives vs. a risk -stratified approach until vaccine -associated 699 anaphylaxis rates were >0.8%). Stratified post -vaccination extended observation time 700 (comparing a standa rd of 15 minutes recommended by the CDC for the general population vs. 30 701 minutes for persons considered potentially at risk for a vaccine -associated allergic reaction) by 702 anaphylaxis history was not cost -effective without >1% anaphylaxis -fatality and >6% risk 703 of vaccination -associated anaphylaxis. Furthermore, withholding of a second mRNA vaccine 704 dose after a first reaction was not cost -effective unless first -dose protection was very high 705 (meaning there was limited value of additional doses) and risk for vaccine -associated 706 anaphylaxis with an additional dose was high.92,93 (Figure E 5, Table E5) Emerging data from a 707 real-world US study of both mRNA vaccines in 3950 recipients noted an 80% relative risk 708 reduction in SARS -CoV -2 infection risk 14 days aft er a single dose of either vaccine may help to 709 enhance this model.94 710 711 As shown in Figure 1, multiple international public health agencies and allergy organizations 712 around the world have issued guidance related to concerns for severe allergic reactions 713 specifically to the mRNA vaccines that generally echo the CDC recommendations. Many also 714 emphasize shared decision making and all suggest consideration of allergy -immunology 715 consultation. Most lack explicit language formally recommending testing to excipients 716 (including PEG) or the vaccine itself as part of the evaluation (due to the absence of evidence 717 and predictive values for the testing).90,95 Only the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology 718 and Allergy (ASCIA) and World Allergy Organization (WAO) suggest consideration for skin 719 testing to the vaccine or its components (e.g ., PEG , polysorbate ) in some cases.8, 25 A 720 recommendation for such patients to undergo evaluation by an allergist may or may not imply 721 consideration for testing as part of this evaluation, though the nature of what should be part of 722 such evaluation is not specified. Threshold agreement was achieved for the voting on these 723 recommendations on the first round of voting ( Table E3) 724 725 Question 2 : In patients without a history of a severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis , to a 726 SARS -CoV -2 vaccine or its excipients, should allergy skin testing to SARS -CoV -2 vaccines or 727 its excipients be performed? 728 729 Recommendation 3: 730 Journal Pre-proofIn patients with no history of a severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis , to SARS -CoV -2 731 vaccines or its excipients , we recommend against vaccine or vaccine excipient testing prior to 732 vaccination in an attempt to predict the rare individual who will have a severe allergic reaction to 733 vaccination . 734 Strong recommendation ; Low Certainty of Evidence . 735 736 Rationale 737 Systematic review and meta -analysis: 738 Systematic review regarding the incidence and/or prevalence of PEG or polysorbate allergy 739 identified 1 study among 608 citations, with an additional study under review also identified.16 740 In a review of a Canadian national physician -reported drug allergy database entries from 2015 - 741 2018 , Abrams et al. found allergy to PEG or medications containing PEG/polysorbate in 135 742 cases out of 1, 055,667 entries of allergic drug reactions , for a n incidence of 42.6 cases per 743 million person -years . This report described no cases where PEG allergic individuals had 744 reported cross -reactivity to any polysorbate containing medicine (and the individuals with 745 polysorbate allergy only reacted to a single agent) .80 In the other report, Stone et al compiled a 746 review of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from 1989 through 747 2017, finding 53 probable cases of anaphylaxis to PE G among 25,905 reports , for an estimated 748 incidence of 4 cases of PEG allergy per year (0.012 cases per million person -years) .16 To allow 749 for pooling, we presumed all cases in the Abrams et al report were anaphylaxis , and the 750 combined incidence rate betwee n these studies is 0.15 cases per million person -years (Figure 3). 751 No studies describing a polysorbate allergy rate were identified. Table E2 details the certainty of 752 evidence for this estimate and Figure E3 the risk of bias assessment. 753 754 Discussion : Historically, vaccines have contained inert excipients such as food proteins ( e.g., 755 egg, gelatin, yeast) or o ther substances (e.g., thimerosal , formaldehyde, latex, neomycin, 756 adjuvants), as well as viral proteins and bacterial toxoids , to which reported ad verse reactions, 757 including allergic reactions of varying severity have been attributed . 96 mRNA vaccines utilize 758 newer technology that differ s from existing vaccines in that they do not contain historically 759 commonly used excipients. Because these vaccines involve nanotechnology to deliver mRNA to 760 recipient cells , they use other excipients, most notably PEG 2000 but also additional lipids and 761 cholesterol .8,9 The AstraZeneca , Sputnik, and Johnson and Johnson vaccine s each contain 762 recombinant adenovi rus and polysorbate 80 .10,11,88 Adenovector virus vaccines are not novel 763 technologies. Table 3 details the excipients in the SARS -CoV -2 vaccine s. 764 From a societal standpoint, the population prevalence of PEG and polysorbate allergies are very 765 rare. In addition, data regarding population -based skin test screening using SARS -CoV -2 vaccine 766 are sparse --only one published study detailing SARS -CoV -2 prick testing prior to initial 767 vaccination for persons (who had not yet received SARS -CoV -2 vaccine) with a general history 768 of anaphylaxis, which noted no positive skin tests.97 The very rare rate of adjudicated cases of 769 SARS -CoV -2 vaccine anaphylaxis and a lack of evidence that COVID -19 vaccine reactions are 770 attributable to PEG or polysorbate , strongly suggests against any population based approach that 771 would involve screening for pre -existing specific -IgE against PEG or polysorbate as a means to 772 predict risk of a severe allergic reaction to a SARS -CoV 2 vaccine .14,18 Threshold agreement was 773 achieved for the vot ing on this recommendation on the first round of voting ( Table E3) 774 Journal Pre-proofPart 2: Recommendations for individuals before their initial or additional SARS -CoV -2 775 vaccination who have a history of an allergic reaction to SARS -CoV -2 vaccine or its 776 excipients 777 778 Questio n 3: In patients with a history of a severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis , to a 779 SARS -CoV -2 vaccine or its excipients, should allergy skin testing to SARS -CoV -2 vaccines or 780 its excipients be performed to determine if vaccine withholding is neede d? 781 782 Recommendation 4: We suggest against the clinician routinely performing skin or in vitro 783 testing using SARS -CoV-2 vaccines or excipients outside of the research setting for the purpose 784 of vaccine withholding , given such testing has unknown sensitivity/specificity in predicting 785 severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, to SARS -CoV -2 vaccine s. 786 787 Conditional recommendation; Low Certainty of Evidence 788 789 Rationale: 790 Systematic Review and Meta -analysis: 791 The utility of PEG testing to inform SARS -CoV -2 vaccine risk of allergic reaction is uncertain. 792 However, data are available to understand how well such testing performs in evaluating persons 793 with a known or suspected allergic reaction to PEG or polysorbate in other contexts. A 794 systematic review identified 21 studies ( all case reports/series) out of 548 citations (excluding 795 duplicates) that described skin testing (skin prick or intradermal) to PEG of any MW and/or 796 polysorbate 80, where control subjects were als o tested.15,16,98 -116 A positive case was defined as 797 any method of skin testing performed with PEG or Polysorbate concentration where the authors 798 deemed the test positive for identification of a wheal and/or flare, without any specific or 799 uniform threshold reported. For PEG, there were 15 reports detailing skin testing to varying 800 agents and concentrations.15,16,98 -110 Following removal of 7 positive skin tests that were 801 duplicated from 5 other studies in one large case series of 37 cases since 1977, we cal culated a 802 pooled sensitivity of 58.8% (30 true positive, 21 false negative) and specificity of 99.5% (247 803 true negative, 1 false positive). However, the specificity may be falsely high due to the case 804 series/report study designs. As well, among the report s, not all patients were challenged to 805 confirm the history of PEG reaction, the diagnostic gold standard , which lowers the certainty of 806 evidence due to indirectness of the testing . There were 6 reports detailing 7 total patients with 807 suspected allergy to polysorbate that had skin testing (no false positives, and 57 controls tested 808 that were non -reactive) .111-116 Polysorbate testing s ensitivity/specificity were not calculated 809 given the low number of patients tested . Table E 2 details the certainty of evide nce for this 810 estimate and Figure E4 the risk of bias assessment. 811 812 The same systematic review identified no studies that investigated vaccine or excipient testing 813 compared to negative controls in individuals with a known or suspected allergic reaction of any 814 severity to a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine. However, 4 case reports (without controls) were identified 815 describing testing with SARS -CoV -2 mRNA vaccine or PEG/polysorbate in persons with 816 reported severe allergic reactions to the vaccine, and vaccine testing in negative controls to 817 establish a non -irritating testing concentration.117,118 119 The first report detail s negative vaccine 818 skin testing among 4 persons with reported allergic react ions to their initial vaccination , 3 of 819 whom electe d to receive a second dose and did so without reaction .118 The second report details 820 Journal Pre-proofnegative PEG 3350 testing in 8 persons with reported allergic reactions their initial vaccine, 7 of 821 whom elected to receive a second dose and did so without reaction; as well as negative 822 polysorbate 80 testing in 6/7 persons tested prior to their initial vaccination, with all 6 receiv ing 823 their initial dose without reacting.117 The third report details no irritant response detected among 824 55 negative controls tested to SARS -CoV mRNA vaccine.119 The fourth detailed 2 adult patients 825 with severe allergic reactions to their initial mRNA (Moderna) vaccine, who underwent skin 826 testing to PEG, polysorbate, and the mRNA vaccine itself. In both patients, excipient skin testing 827 was negative but intradermal skin tests to the Moderna vaccine were positive. However, both 828 tolerated graded dosing administration of the vaccine without issue.120 Lastly, one case report of 829 PEG testing was identified in a female patient with a past history of skin and oropharyngeal 830 reactions to PEG containing products, who sought evaluation after experienc ing a reported 831 systemic reaction to her initial dose of the Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine that was treated with 832 epinephrine but was not associated with tryptase elevation. While undergoing testing, 833 approximately 12 minutes after PEG 4000 prick skin test was applied , she developed a multi - 834 system systemic reaction treated with epinephrine treatment , which also was not associated with 835 tryptase elevat ion. Skin testing to the Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine and to PEG MW less than 4000 836 were all negative, and neither vaccine re -challenge nor challenge to PEG 4000 or any other 837 molecular weight PEG were attempted.121 One additional case report was noted regarding an 838 atopic female with a past episode of urticaria attributable to a topical product possibly containing 839 PEG, who developed an erythematous rash, then slurred mouth and hoarseness over the course of 840 5 hours post her initial Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine (though had no symptoms at 30 minutes) . Her 841 serum tryptase level was normal, and this reaction occurred despite steroid premedication 842 starting 14 hours before vaccination and antihistamine an hour before vaccination . During 843 evaluation by an allergy specialist 2 weeks after the event , while no PEG or vaccine skin testing 844 was reported, she was noted to have an elevated basophil activation test ( 14.79 CD203chigh%) to 845 PEG 4000 at 0.2mg/mL (and no activation seen in 5 negative control patients ).122 846 847 Discussion: PEG -2000 is speculated to be a potential culprit in allergic reactions to SARS -CoV - 848 2 mRNA vaccines .14,123 PEG and polysorbate are ubiquitous compounds, found in many health 849 and beauty products and in foods and beverages, and are routinely used and tolerated in daily 850 life.14 There are limited case reports in the medical literature of allerg ic reactions attributable to 851 PEG contained in therapeutic agents and radiocontrast media.15,16,98,124 -126 PEG is available in 852 different molecular weights and structural formats. Allergic r eactions may be more likely with 853 higher molecular weight (MW) PEG agents , higher concentrations, or parenteral administration . 854 It is uncertain if the concentration and MW of PEG in SARS -CoV -2 mRNA vaccines would be 855 sufficient to cause reactions 15,16 There is theoretical concern , but limited evidence, that PEG may 856 cross -react with certain polysorbates.16 Polysorbate -80 in adenovirus -vector vaccines was not 857 implicated as causing allergic reactions in their trials, and there is limited reporting of allergic 858 reactions of any severity with these vaccines. 859 860 Evaluation for suspected PEG allergy is largely based on history. Use of high MW PEG 861 solutions as skin testing agents has not consistently demonstrated the ability to elicit wheal and 862 flare responses , and it remains unclear if this approach would reliably indicate the presence (or 863 absence) of specific IgE.125 In this meta -analysis, the pooled sensitivity of PEG skin testing is 864 only 58.8%, but the pooled specificity is 99 .5%, which implies that the test will miss identifying 865 the presence of PEG -specific IgE in a significant number of PEG allergic patients, but non-PEG 866 allergic individuals do not appear to have falsely positive tests. There have been few cases of 867 Journal Pre-proofanaphylaxis reported to intradermal skin testing , mainly using PEG with MW>3000 . Other non- 868 validated methods of detection for PEG -induced allergic response have been described , as has 869 PEG o ral provocation challenge.15,16,98 In individual with a high pre -test probability of PEG 870 allergy, testing to PEG, from these data in the meta -analysis show a very uncertain (very serious 871 risk of bias) high positive likelihood ratio to confirm the diagnosis. However, this is distinct 872 from the suggestion that PEG testing can inform the likelihoo d of a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine 873 reaction (very serious indirectness) . This was noted in case series to date where 10 persons who 874 reacted to their mRNA vaccine in fact had negative PEG skin testing , and where 2 patients 875 additionally were skin tested to PEG as well as to both polysorbate (negative) and the Moderna 876 vaccine (positive intradermal test) and tolerated re-administration .117,120 In the case of a person 877 with a mRNA vaccine reaction where PEG sensitization was detected, this was only to PEG 878 4000, and not the vaccine or the concentration of PEG in the vaccine . There is not yet any 879 convincing evidence to confirm PEG as a causative agent in the reported SARS -CoV -2 mRNA 880 vaccine reactions and the diagnostic utility of PEG and polysorbate allergy testing is highly 881 uncertain .14,18,90,123 Of note, skin testing to the vaccines is not approved under any of the EUA s. 882 Further research regarding excipient and vaccine skin testing in this context i s needed. 883 884 Other mechanisms might potentially cause allergic symptoms following administration of SARS - 885 CoV -2 mRNA vaccines . Complement Activat ion-Related Pseudoallerg y (CARPA ) has been 886 theorized as a possible mechanism , in particular with lipids used in drug delivery .127 128 mRNA 887 particles themselves may also potentially be a causative agent, acting as a direct mast cell 888 degranulat ion agent. There is one report that t rometamol, a buffer specific to the Moderna 889 vaccine , was associated with anaphylaxis to g adolinium -based contrast agents , also by a direct 890 degranulation mechanism .129 Toll Like Receptors (TLR) 3 ,7, and 8 can be directly activated by 891 double -stranded and single -stranded RNA particles from viruses, and can cause mast cell 892 degranulation.130,131 Although the likelihood of such event s from a SARS -CoV -2 mRNA vaccine 893 is unclear, these pathway s should be considered among the potential mechanisms for allergic 894 reactions to these vaccines.132 895 896 Caution should be exercised in considering excipients as a provoking cause of vaccine reactions . 897 While excipients have occasionally caused allergic reactions with other vaccines , historically 898 many excipients have also been wrongly implicated based on theoretical rather than actual risk, 899 most prominently egg (ovalbumin) in modern influenza vaccines.75,96,133 This may be due to 900 excipient concentration s being well below a threshold necessary to provoke a reaction.134,135 This 901 may also prove to be the case for excipient s that are suspected trigger s for the SARS -CoV -2 902 vaccine reactions. 903 904 There is one published approach for SARS -CoV -2 mRNA vaccination with guidance based on 905 skin testing to excipients. 14,18 Notably, if methylprednisolone acetate is used for testing, the 906 clinician should be aware this may contain both PEG and Polysorbate 80 , and should test only 907 with brands of methylprednisolone that do not also contain Polysorbate 80 .14 The clinician 908 should also be aware that the quantity of PEG administered by intradermal testing using this 909 agent could exceed the quantity of PEG in the Pfizer -BioNTech mRNA vaccine, which only 910 contains 0.05mg PEG -2000 per dose (Table E 6). Therefore, even in persons with known PEG 911 allergy who have positive PEG skin testing, it is likely that graded or full dose SARS -CoV -2 912 mRNA vaccine would be well tolerated if no systemic allergic reaction occurred during skin 913 Journal Pre-prooftesting. The positive PEG test is less problematic to interpret, given this specificity, but no data 914 exists to specify that positive PEG sensitization definitively infers a significant risk that such 915 patients will not tolerate PEG -containing vaccines. As such, there is no clear role fo r the use of 916 skin testing to PEG to inform a decision to withhold the vaccine or not, which is consistent with 917 the last published vaccine allergy practice parameter which suggests excipient or vaccine 918 sensitized individuals should be offered a graded dose challenge or multi -step desensitization 919 instead of withholding the vaccine .14,96 Data regarding skin testing to SARS -CoV -2 vaccine 920 itself are scant. There are a small number of patients with suspected SARS -CoV -2 vaccine 921 reactions who have undergone vaccin e testing, most with negative results, but all who were 922 willing to receive a second dose tolerated it without reaction irrespective of positive vaccine skin 923 testing .117,118,120 The 3 individuals with a history of mRNA reaction with sensitization to either 924 the vaccine or PEG either declined or were not offered the opportunity to receive a second dose. 925 If vaccine testing is to be performed in persons hesitant to proceed with vaccination, the vaccine 926 should be prepared per manufacturer instructions with regard to storage, thawing, and diluting 927 for reconstitution. Consistent with the last published vaccin e practice parameter, patients with 928 positive skin testing to a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine may receive vaccination through graded or full 929 dosing (see below) .120 Limited safety data are available for testing to the vaccine or the vaccine 930 excipients in this context. Further details regarding international variation about 931 recommendations for vaccine/excipient testing are detailed in Figure 1. 932 933 While testing may be considered as a preference -sensitive option in shared decision -making, 934 options for cautious administra tion of vaccine (Figure 4) or the use of an alternative vaccine with 935 a different platform and excipient may be additional considerations . Testing for PEG has not 936 been shown to be necessary or of value in individuals with a history of severe allergic reacti ons, 937 including anaphylaxis , to mRNA SARS -CoV -2 vaccines, nor has PEG yet been demonstrated as 938 the causative agent of mRNA SARS -CoV -2 vaccine allergic reactions. Moreover, it has poor 939 sensitivity in evaluating those with known severe allergic reactions to PEG. However, PEG 940 testing may be considered in the very narrow context of shared decision -making in individuals 941 who would otherwise be unwilling to be vaccinated and would decline vaccination if not offered 942 testing. Testing -specific guidance could change i f and when convincing evidence emerges for a 943 role for PEG as a culprit agent . PEG -2000, the actual excipient, would likely be preferable to 944 higher MW PEG as a testing agent , if available. Given the low mortality of anaphylaxis (<0.5%) 945 in general,136 and th e higher mortality /morbidity of COVID -19, the risk of withholding SARS - 946 CoV -2 vaccination is highly likely to exceed the risk of a severe allergic reaction, including 947 anaphylaxis , after administration of the vaccine for many patients . However this consideration 948 regarding withholding additional vaccine doses could change if additional estimates emerge of 949 potentially high efficacy of a single dose of an mRNA vaccine , which could allow more time for 950 decision -making regarding the risk/re ward of additional dosing .94 Threshold agreement was 951 achieved for the voting on this recommendation on the first round of voting ( Table E3 ). 952 953 Question 4: Should SARS -CoV -2 mRNA or adenovirus vector vaccine s be administered to an 954 individual who had an immed iate allergic reaction to the first dose of the vaccine (defined as a 955 generalized, systemic allergic reaction with acute onset occurring within 4 hours of vaccine 956 administration) , or given as a first dose to an individual who is suspected to have reacted 957 previously to an excipient ingredient that is also present in the SARS -CoV -2 mRNA or 958 adenovirus vector vaccine s? 959 Journal Pre-proof 960 Recommendation 5: We recommend a shared decision -making paradigm of care favoring 961 vaccination through full or graded dosing (with or without additional observation time post - 962 vaccination) or changing vaccine platforms to another agent over no vaccination because there is 963 no single best approach to assessment and management of th e patient with a suspected SARS - 964 CoV -2 mRNA or adenovirus vector vaccine reaction , or the patient with an allergy to an 965 excipient in either of these vaccines who has not yet been vaccinated. 966 Strong Recommendation ; Moderate Certainty of Evidence 967 968 Recommend ation 6: In patients with suspected immediate allergic reaction to SARS -CoV -2 969 vaccine whose standard schedule requires more than one dose, we recommend referral to an 970 allergist for assessment of additional vaccination over no vaccination /vaccination being 971 withheld . In resource limited settings where specialist referral is not readily available, 972 alternatives may be presented in a shared decision -making context to provide assessment and 973 opportunity for vaccination by remote consultation, use of alternative va ccine products, or delay 974 in vaccination until a solution can be determined. 975 Strong Recommendation ; Moderate Certainty of Evidence 976 977 Recommendation 7: In patients with a suspected or confirmed but remote past medical history of 978 reaction to a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine excipient, we recommend referral to an allergist for 979 assessment of additional vaccination over no vaccination/vaccination being withheld . In resource 980 limited settings where specialist referral is not readily available, alternatives may be presented in 981 a shared decision -making context to provide assessment and opportunity for vaccination by 982 remote consultation, use of alternative vaccine products, or delay in vaccination until a solution 983 can be determined. 984 Strong Recommendation ; Moderate Certainty of Ev idence 985 986 Recommendation 8: In patients with a definite/confirmed recent allergic reaction to SARS -CoV - 987 2 vaccine and/or excipient, we recommend referral to an allergist for assessment of additional 988 vaccination over no vaccination/vaccination being withheld . In resource limited settings where 989 specialist referral is not readily available, alternatives may be presented in a shared decision - 990 making context to provide assessment and opportunity for vaccination by remote consultation, 991 use of alternative vaccine prod ucts, or delay in vaccination until a solution can be determined. 992 Strong Recommendation ; Low Certainty of Evidence 993 994 Recommendation 9: While all vaccines should be administered in facilities capable of treating 995 anaphylaxis, particularly for individuals wit h a prior immediate systemic allergic reaction to a 996 SARS -CoV -2 vaccine or vaccine excipient, w e recommend the clinician should administer 997 SARS -CoV -2 mRNA or adenovirus vector vaccine in a setting equipped to manage anaphylaxis 998 (e.g. hospital, mass immunization clinic, specialist office ), under the supervision of personnel 999 trained in the recognition and management of anaphylaxis. In resource limited settings where 1000 specialist referral is not readily available, alternatives may be presented in a s hared decision - 1001 making context to provide assessment and opportunity for vaccination by remote consultation, 1002 use of alternative vaccine products, or delay in vaccination until a solution can be determined. 1003 Strong Recommendation ; Moderate Certainty of Evidence 1004 1005 Journal Pre-proofRecommendation 10: We suggest against routine H1-antihistamine or systemic corticosteroid 1006 pre-medication prior to vaccination as it has low certainty evidence in preventing anaphylaxis, 1007 and theoretically corticosteroid pre -medication could diminish th e immune response. 1008 Conditional Recommendation ; Low Certainty of Evidence 1009 1010 Recommendation 11: We recommend in favor of globally coordinated research studies being 1011 conducted to address i) vaccine and vaccine excipient testing diagnostic accuracy for allergy to 1012 SARS -CoV -2 vaccines; ii) administration of the vaccine to individuals with prior anaphylaxis to 1013 the vaccine or vaccine excipient; iii) t he necessity and efficacy of graded vaccine administration 1014 in the context of a patient with possible SARS -CoV -2 vaccine allergy; iv) the safety , efficacy , 1015 and necessity of mixing SARS -CoV-2 vaccine platforms; and v) the incremental benefit of 1016 additional do ses of an mRNA or certain adenovirus -vector vaccines following an initial dose . 1017 Research Recommendation 1018 1019 Rationale/Discussion: Almost all allergy organizations recommend that the routine 1020 administration of SARS -CoV -2 vaccines are contraindicated in individuals with a suspected 1021 immediate allergic reaction to the SARS -CoV -2 vaccines or their components (i.e., PEG or 1022 polysorbate 80 ), although all allow consider ation of referral to an allergist -immunologist to 1023 determine the likelihood the initial reported reaction was consistent with an allergic reaction of 1024 any severity, and if so, if a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine can be safely administered. (Figure 1) There is 1025 similar consistenc y in the precaution for patients with non -anaphylactic reactions to the initial 1026 vaccine dose (and for the CDC, a history of immediate allergic reactions to other vaccines or 1027 injectable medications) to be considered for vaccination under observation.137,88 The Sputnik 1028 vaccine is contraindicated in people with a hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components or 1029 any vaccine containing similar components, as well as contraindicated in people with a history of 1030 severe allergic reaction to the vaccine or its ex cipients . Additionally, the second dose of the 1031 Sputnik vaccine is contraindicated where severe complications, such as anaphylactic shock, 1032 severe generalized allergic reaction, seizures, fever over 40\u00b0C were noted after the first dose.138 1033 The CDC has issued a precaution to receiving th e Johnson & Johnson vaccine in persons in 1034 whom the SARS -CoV -2 mRNA vaccine is contraindicated and suggested an option for 1035 administration of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine at least 28 days after the initial SARS -CoV-2 1036 mRNA vaccine dose, although the incremental safety and effectiveness of such a substitution is 1037 unknown.139 The Johnson & Johnson vaccine carries with it a risk of thrombotic events (as does 1038 the AstraZeneca vaccine) , which should be a consideration in t his decision .140,141 1039 1040 Preference -sensitive care is defined by scenarios where there are multiple treatment options 1041 having significant tradeoffs and varying potential outcomes, w here treatment decisions reflect 1042 the patient's personal values and preferences.142 Despite general international agreement that 1043 evaluation by an allergist -immunologist be considered for patients with suspected risk of allergic 1044 reaction to the vaccine , there is no elaboration on how the allergy specialist should evaluate these 1045 patien ts to determ ine whether vaccination is advisable and how to proceed . The allergist can be 1046 of central importance in this evaluation process by taking a detailed history that thoroughly 1047 investigates the nature and timing of the reported reaction, and careful ly considers the nature of 1048 the report ed symptoms and whether they are the result of an immune mediated process and not 1049 the result of any mimicking condition that could be the result of a non -allergic process. This step 1050 alone is of critical importance and m ay represent the greatest value that the allergist can offer as 1051 Journal Pre-proofan expert in such evaluation . Also critical to involvement of the allergist i n this process i s for the 1052 persons providing vaccination to be trained to ask questions regarding risk of reaction a nd help 1053 facilitate referral to the allergist if there is a contraindication to receiving a dose , or in the case of 1054 a suspected allergic reaction occurring at their site. If possible, patients with a history of a 1055 possible allergy to PEG, polysorbate, other vaccines, or even their initial SARS -CoV -2 vaccine 1056 should be encouraged to be proactive in discussing this with their primary care provider before 1057 seeking initial or additional SARS -CoV -2 vaccine doses. 1058 1059 The 2012 Adverse Reactions to Vaccine Practice Param eter (from the American Academy of 1060 Allergy Asthma and Immunology [AAAAI ] and American College of Allergy Asthma and 1061 Immunology [ACAAI ] Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters) outlines a general approach for 1062 a patient with a known or suspected history of a vaccine/vaccine excipient reaction.96 This 1063 includes possible vaccine and excipient testing, and several contextualized ways for vaccines to 1064 be administered. This approach recognizes that while administration of a vaccine in routine 1065 medical settings (e.g. , non -allergy specialist) is contraindicated, with allergy specialist 1066 evaluation and supervision, the vaccine can still potentially be given. The ACAAI COVID -19 1067 task force outlines, but does not endorse, an approach of graded vaccine challenge that could b e 1068 considered for certain individuals. At least one case report has demonstrated this is both safe and 1069 feasible, though it is unclear if this is necessary.120 The Australasian Society of Clinical 1070 Immunology and Allergy ( ASCIA and Clinical Immunology 1071 (CSACI ) and European Academy Immunology ( EAACI ) provide 1072 guidance for graded challenges in these patients and are consistent with the 2012 Practice 1073 Parameter.21,143,144 However, none of these recommendations h ave data denoting safety. 1074 1075 COVID -19 and ramifications of SARS -CoV -2 infection represent a highly unique situation 1076 relative to other infectious diseases in terms of the global burden of this disease, and an 1077 imperative international public health need to attain herd immunity through vaccination. Any 1078 potential for vaccine refusal or the vaccine being withheld in a pandemic must be approached 1079 from an ethical perspective which consider s whether SARS -CoV -2 infection and viral 1080 propagation are riskier outcomes than vaccination in a setting where severe allergic reactions can 1081 be managed .145 While n o single best choice in these contexts exists , it can be addressed through 1082 an individualized, shared decision -making approach reviewing treatment options and the risk-to- 1083 benefit trade -offs related to vaccine reactions vs. SARS -CoV -2 infection risk. Regardless of how 1084 the vaccine is administered, we recommend against routine pre -medication prior to v accination 1085 (particularly with glucocorticosteroids) as it has low certainty evidence in preventing 1086 anaphylaxis, and gluco corticosteroid pre -medication (or glucocorticosteroid treatment of any 1087 suspected allergic reactions to SARS -CoV -2 vaccines including an aphylaxis ) could diminish the 1088 immune response.146,147 1089 1090 Figure 4 outlines preference -sensitive a pproaches to the individual who had an allergic reaction 1091 to the initial dose of the vaccine. The allergist role here is central as well in helping a patient 1092 clarify their values as to their choices and the outcomes of those choices in proceeding with or 1093 declining vaccination. This process is highly distinct from evaluating someone with a history of 1094 allergy to a vaccine excipient, who has not yet received the in itial vaccine. These approaches are 1095 only recommended for trained experts in the diagnosis of medication allergy (including allergic 1096 reactions to vaccines and medication provocation challenge ), in facilities staffed with personnel 1097 Journal Pre-proofskilled and trained to be able to assess and treat an allergic reaction resulting from testing or 1098 vaccine administration. Resources must be available to provide direct observation of patients for 1099 a minimum of 30 minutes after the vaccine is administered. The outlined approaches all involve 1100 some degree of trade -off, and the ultimate choice must be informed by the values, goals, and 1101 preferences of patients. These issues must be balanced against increased infection risk , with 1102 increased morbidity and mortality , which becomes a risk from vaccine refusal or withholding 1103 vaccination . Graded vaccine challenge does offer some practical reassurance to the patient and 1104 clinician reluctant to proceed with single -dose vaccination, though full dose vaccination may be 1105 just as safe as a graded approach in many circumstances. In resource limited settings or if 1106 consultation with an allergy specialist is not readily available, such as in rural settings or in low- 1107 and middle -income countries, such shared decision -making does no t need to be exclusively 1108 provided by a specialist. While specialist referral would be preferred any clinician may engage 1109 the patient in shared decision -making based on the options in Figure 4, allowing for local context 1110 in decision making, with input to t he patient from the practitioners who are trusted by the local 1111 population . In particular, if first dose protection of any SARS -CoV -2 vaccine is high, or there is 1112 availability of an alternative vaccine platform, particular preference may be given for vacci ne 1113 refusal/withholding the vaccine or administering this alternative agent in certain local and 1114 regional settings. 1115 1116 Experience with graded challenge with SARS -CoV -2 mRNA vaccines is limited at present to 1117 one very small case series . The efficacy of g raded vaccination is unknown , though one report 1118 has shown this can be successful .120 It is unknown if splitting doses and/or diluting the vaccine 1119 outside of the initial manufacturer recommendation would disrupt the vaccine integrity or impair 1120 immune response. However, these variables may potentially contribute to unforeseen issues in 1121 trying to adapt previously recommended approaches for vaccine administration where there is 1122 concern of possible allergy, rendering this option for graded -dose administration less preferable 1123 than single -dose administration.96 Switching from one vaccine platform to another is an 1124 additional alternative to consider in this decisional matrix that may reduce reliance on graded - 1125 dosing and may be a more feasible offi ce-based choice , which is endorsed by a number of 1126 international regulatory health agencies where multiple vaccine options are approved (Figure 1127 1).139 1128 1129 The evaluation of individuals with a known or suspected PEG allergy (including anaphylaxis) 1130 but who hav e not yet received a vaccine is distinct. An algorithm for excipient testing has been 1131 published, but without evidence that the vaccine excipients are the cause of any vaccine 1132 reactions, or that excipient allergic/sensitized individuals cannot tolerate the vaccine. Our meta - 1133 analysis suggests skin testing to excipients as a screening measure prior to vaccination has low 1134 sensitivity and is unlikely to reliably identify persons at risk. A choice to test and then 1135 recommend a sensitized person not receive an mRNA vaccine could unnecessarily withhold an 1136 intervention based on speculation of risk, or force choice of an alternative vaccine platform (if 1137 available) that may have different non -immunologic risks. However, this could be a preference - 1138 sensitive option that concerned patients elect, and a negative skin test could be viewed as 1139 reassuring to proceed with use of an mRNA vaccination, despite th e test having poor sensitivity. 1140 Similarly, it is reasonable to administer an mRNA vaccine following a shared decision -making 1141 process with an allergy specialist, either as a single or graded dose, or to provide an adenovirus 1142 vector vaccine (with precaution given polysorbate content) without testing . For individuals with 1143 Journal Pre-proofa polysorbate allergy, it is reasonable to administer an adenovirus vector vaccine following a 1144 shared decision -making process with an allergy specialist, either as a single or graded dose, o r to 1145 provide an mRNA vaccine (with precaution given PEG content) without testing . Either vaccine 1146 should be given in a setting where the patient can be monitored for up to 30 minutes after 1147 vaccination and that is staffed and equipped to treat potential vacc ine-associated anaphylaxis. 1148 1149 Withholding or refusing a second dose of an mRNA vaccine (either Moderna or Pfizer - 1150 BioNTech) has been considered by some , in the belief that the initial dose will provide adequate 1151 protection. Although we lack precise estimat es of what constitutes durable protective adaptive 1152 immunity post -vaccination, data from the EUA suggest there is >50% protection at >2 weeks 1153 after the first dose (prior to administration of the second dose). Israeli reports suggest 33% to 1154 60% protection mo re than 2 weeks after the first dose up to the time of the second dose.148 1155 Additional studies have suggested first -dose protection of up to 93% but with wide ranges of 1156 protection reported.9,60,92,94,149 -151 However, the duration of this partial protection is unknown, 1157 but likely shorter -lived than the immunity achieved after 2 doses or achieved natural ly from 1158 SARS -CoV -2 infection . Optimal longer -term protection would be ensured by complete 1159 vaccination. Partial immunity at a community level is of concern because it might theoretically 1160 enable the spread of more virulent variants of the virus. Even within a shared decision -making 1161 paradigm, vaccine refusal or withholding a vaccine should remain an option of last resort , and all 1162 steps taken to a void this outcome . Withholding/refusal , if chosen, should be clearly documented 1163 in the medical record, and the decision to do so made collaboratively by the patient after having 1164 been provided data regarding the nature of the risks.92 1165 1166 Threshold agreeme nt was achieved for the voting on these recommendations on the first round of 1167 voting ( Table E3 ). 1168 1169 This document has several limitations. First, SARS -CoV -2 vaccination is a new and evolving 1170 topic, and data to date regarding allergic reactions, potential pr ovoking causes of these reactions, 1171 and best management practices are limited. As such, there is intent to continue to re -evaluate and 1172 update these recommendations as more data are published regarding reactions and their 1173 management. Second, GRADE is one ev idence rating approach, and has well -described 1174 limitations. Third, in this context, several recommendations are conditional, and have low 1175 certainty of evidence, which underscores the first limitation. This in particular may impact 1176 recommendations regardin g excipient and/or direct vaccine testing, as well as considerations 1177 about withholding/refusing vaccination (initial or subsequent doses) or the best initial choice of a 1178 vaccine given a patient's history. Fourth, to perform the meta -analysis and data pool ing for 1179 questions 2 and 3, we made two major assumptions: i) we considered all reactions coded in a 1180 Canadian drug allergy database as allergy to PEG or PEG containing medications as 1181 anaphylaxis; and ii) we considered any positive PEG skin test, by any met hod (prick or 1182 intradermal), to any listed concentration, as the same for the purposes of denoting a positive 1183 result to assess testing sensitivity and specificity. Both these assumptions allow for a liberal 1184 consideration of what defines a case, and increas es the potential sensitivity of the analysis, at the 1185 risk of inflating both estimates. However, given limited data, we feel these are justified. Fifth, 1186 while our approach and recommendations were developed through systematic evidence 1187 synthesis , in some i nstances these recommendations contradict more empiric approaches from 1188 allergy professional societies and governmental health authorities. It is of note that no approach 1189 Journal Pre-proofor recommendation \u2014ones made in this document or made previously by any society or 1190 governmental health authority \u2014have been proven safe by high certainty of evidence in the 1191 context of evaluating suspected allergic reactions to these vaccines. Lastly, our 1192 recommendations may be limited to the populations that have been s tudied. Our a pproaches and 1193 considerations may be more or less relevant in particular countries or regions , depending on 1194 government policy, access to vaccination, access to allergy specialists for evaluation of potential 1195 reactions , and availability of resou rces for some of the options in our shared decision -making 1196 paradigm . In this analysis, there were no studies identified that addressed this issue in the 1197 context of low to middle income areas or resource -limited area s, and most of the studies on 1198 vaccine an aphylaxis are from tertiary care centers, which by definition are areas with access to 1199 specialty care, including allergists . In areas with out access to an allergist, remote healthcare 1200 options or involvement of a healthcare provider who can assess and mana ge vaccine reactions 1201 could be considered , though this does not address individuals without access to care or locations 1202 lacking in some of the resources described . It is possible that recommendations made by an 1203 allergy specialist who is not actually adminis tering the vaccine, to another care provider who is 1204 doing so, may not necessarily be accepted by others who may have less experience in treating 1205 anaphylaxis, or with administering a vaccine to someone who has been evaluated for a vaccine - 1206 associated allergi c reaction. These factors may modify the recommendations stated. The 1207 Evidence to Decision Framework supplement provides a summary reflection of the evidence in 1208 the context of the clinical recommendation and helps balance the recommendations in light of 1209 these limitations. 1210 1211 Conclusion 1212 SARS -CoV -2 is a devastating global pandemic with limited treatment options, which has caused 1213 >3,000,000 global fatalities and >$10 trillion in global economic costs.3 To achieve an optimal 1214 population herd immunity and mitigate the devastating impact of this infection , vaccination 1215 represents the optimal global strategy. Multiple vaccines have proven to be safe and effective in 1216 clinical trials and are now in use. P otential allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been 1217 reported , but these have occurred very rarely . No uniform recommendations exist on an approach 1218 to the assessment and management of individuals with a known or suspected allergy to the 1219 excipients or the vaccine itself. This document provides evi dence -based (where available) expert 1220 consensus that incorporates guidance from clinical specialists in Australia, Canada, Europe, 1221 South Africa, the United States, and the United Kingdom stressing a patient -centered approach 1222 involving consideration of the risks and benefits of receiving COVID -19 vaccination, the value 1223 and cost -effectiveness of testing and precautionary measures, and shared decision -making in 1224 recognition of multiple preference -sensitive approaches to this issue from an international 1225 perspect ive. There is no clear evidence that any pre -existing factor, or testing with the vaccine or 1226 excipients, can predict risk of reaction to the vaccine. As this is the first experience with these 1227 vaccines, this is intended to be a living document that will require periodic updating due to still 1228 emerging needs assessment , including further research data on the nature of vaccine -associated 1229 reactions and the necessity of potential risk -assessment measures . There are continued 1230 knowledge gaps and unmet needs outlined in Table 4 that must be addressed as the vaccine 1231 rollout continues . Given an imperative global need to vaccinate as many people in as many 1232 countries as possible, the clinician should be familiar with the risk of potential reactions to these 1233 vaccines, and the approach to their evaluation and management. 1234 1235 Journal Pre-proofReferences: 1236 1237 1.

For patients with no history of a previous severe allergic reaction to a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine or its excipients, the risk of SARS -CoV -2 vaccine -induced anaphylaxis is very rare and we recommend vaccination over no vaccination based on this risk . Strong High For patients with a history of a severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis, unrelated to a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine or excipient but no history of a previous severe allergic reaction to a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine or its excipients , the requirement for additional observation beyond standard wait time (e.g., recommended by local health authorities for the general population ) provides a minimal absolute risk reduction in severe allergic reaction outcomes and may also contribute to vaccine hesitancy . Therefore, we su ggest against prolonged observation in those with a history of severe allergic reactions unrelated to a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine or excipient. Conditional Low In patients without a history of anaphylaxis to a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine or its excipients, should allergy skin testing to SARS - CoV -2 vaccines or its excipients be performed? In patients with no history of a severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis, to SARS - CoV -2 vaccines or its excipients, we recommend against vaccine or vaccine excipient testing prior to vaccination in an attempt to predict the rare individual who will have a severe allergic reaction to vaccination. Strong Low In patients with a history of anaphylaxis to a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine or its excipients, should allergy skin testing to SARS - CoV -2 vaccines or its excipients be performed to determine if vaccine withholding is needed ? We suggest against the clinician routinely performing skin or in vitro testing using SARS - CoV-2 vaccines or excipients outside of the research setting for the purpose of vaccine withholding, given such testing has unknown sensitivity/specificity in predicting severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, to SARS -CoV -2 vaccines. Conditional Low Should SARS -CoV -2 mRNA or adenovirus vector vaccines be administered to an individual who had a n immediate allergic reaction to the first dose of the vaccine (defined as a generalized, systemic allergic reaction with acute onset occurring within 4 hours of vaccine administration), or given as a first dose to an individual who is suspected to have re acted previously to an excipient ingredient that is also present in the SARS -CoV -2 mRNA or adenovirus vector vaccines? We recommend a shared decision -making paradigm of care favoring vaccination through full or graded dosing (with or without additional obs ervation time post -vaccination) or changing vaccine platforms to another agent over no vaccination because there is no single best approach to assessment and management of the patient with a suspected SARS -CoV -2 mRNA or adenovirus vector vaccine reaction, or the patient with an allergy to an excipient in either of these vaccines who has not yet been vaccinated. Strong Moderate In patients with suspected immediate allergic reaction to SARS -CoV -2 vaccine whose standard schedule requires more than one dose, we recommend referral to an allergist for assessment of additional vaccination over no vaccination/vaccination being withheld. In resource limited settings where specialist referral is not readily available, alternatives may be presented in a shared decision -making context to provide assessment and opportunity for vaccination by remote consultation, use of alternative vaccine pro ducts, or delay in vaccination until a solution can be determined. Strong Moderate In patients with a suspected or confirmed but remote past medical history of reaction to a vaccine excipient, we recommend referral to an allergist for assessment of addi tional vaccination over no vaccination/vaccination being withheld . In resource limited settings where specialist referral is not readily available, alternatives may be presented in a shared decision -making context to provide assessment and opportunity for vaccination by remote consultation, use of alternative vaccine products, or delay in vaccination until a solution can be determined. Strong Moderate In patients with a definite/confirmed recent allergic reaction to COVID vaccine and/or excipient, we recommend referral to an allergist for assessment of additional vaccination over no vaccination/vaccination being withheld . In resource limited settings wh ere specialist referral is not readily available, alternatives may be presented in a shared decision -making context to provide assessment and opportunity for vaccination by remote consultation, use of alternative vaccine products, or delay in vaccination u ntil a solution can be determined. Strong Low While all vaccines should be administered in facilities capable of treating anaphylaxis, particularly for individuals with a prior immediate systemic allergic reaction to a SARS - CoV -2 vaccine or vaccine excipient, we recommend the clinician should administ er SARS - CoV -2 mRNA or adenovirus vector vaccine in a setting equipped to manage anaphylaxis (e.g. hospital, mass immunization clinic, specialist office), under the supervision of personnel trained in the recognition and management of anaphylaxis. In resour ce limited Strong Moderate Journal Pre-proofsettings where specialist referral is not readily available, alternatives may be presented in a shared decision -making context to provide assessment and opportunity for vaccination by remote consultation, use of alternative vaccine products, or delay in vaccination until a solution can be determined. We suggest against routine H1 -antihistamine or systemic corticosteroid pre -medication prior to vaccination as it has low certainty evidence in preventing anaphylaxis, and theoretic ally corticosteroid pre -medication could diminish the immune response. Conditional Low We recommend in favor of globally coordinated research studies being conducted to address i) vaccine and vaccine excipient testing diagnostic accuracy for allergy to SARS - CoV -2 vaccines; ii) administration of the vaccine to individuals with prior anaphylaxis to the vaccine or vaccine excipient; iii) the necessity and efficacy of graded vaccine administration in the context of a patient with possible SARS -CoV -2 vaccine allergy; iv) the safety, efficacy, and necessity of mixing SARS -CoV -2 vaccine platforms; and v) the incremental benefit of additional doses of an mRNA or certain adenovirus -vector vaccines following an initial dose .

The green to red color gradient across and within each choice represents gradually increasing risk. There is no single best-choice approach to vaccinating an individual with a suspected history of an allergic reaction to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. There is a trade-off between potential subsequent risk of a reaction and the ability that can be safely managed, the risk of reduced efficacy from splitting the vaccine dose into two or more steps that may require dilution, and the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection as a result of having partial immunity resulting from deferring additional vaccine doses. The risks, benefits, and trade-offs should be thoroughly and carefully discussed with the patient, and the selected approach be made through a shared decision-making process. Alternative vaccine platforms may encourage use of options to give the vaccine with or without additional observation time, although use of combination SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platforms has not been well studied. Consult published guidance regarding how to interpret antibody titers or other immune markers post-vaccination. *All of the approaches outlined are only intended for consideration in a specialist's office, who has been trained in the diagnosis and management of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.

Formal decision aids may have less of a role to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences.

It also was the only study that was not a national pharmacovigilance study. Though it contributed to some heterogeneity, it was not felt that this was so serious to rate down for inconsistency because the (1) estimate of effect was still rare, (2) excluding this study, yielding a pooled estimate of 6.43 (3.57 -11.56) events per million doses was not importantly different in terms of rarity, (3) that this study was balanced by other studies with 0 events, and (4) visual inspection did not reveal serious inconsistency. c.

Summary of the Modified Delphi Panel R esults Question % Agreement and Mean Scorea,b Free text comments Recommendation 1 : For patients with no history of a previous allergic reaction to a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine or its excipients, the risk of SARS -CoV -2 vaccine - induced anaphylaxis is very rare and we recommend vaccination over no vaccination based on this risk . Strong Recommendation; High Certainty of Evidence 100% Mean score: 4.98 Strongly agree; Survey of Canada, very low numbers; Excellent section! Recommendation 2 : For patients with no hi story of a previous allergic reaction to a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine or its excipients the requirement for additional observation beyond standard wait time (e.g., recommended by local health authorities for the general population ) provides a minimal absolute risk reduction in severe anaphylaxis outcomes and may also contribute to vaccine hesitancy. Therefore, we suggest against prolonged observation in those with a history of anaphylaxis unrelated to a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine or excipient. Conditional Recommendation; L ow Certainty of Evidence 90.7% Mean score: 4.53 This may provide some patients with peace of mind and reassurance; I admit this is more art than science, but would not favor this recommendation, although qualified as conditional. When I have done this for selected patients (e.g., someone with venom anaphylaxis, not a patient with pollen -fruit syndrome) they do not view this as a burden, but seem to welcome the recommendation to prolong the wait time to 30 minutes; strongly agree; Is there evidence that lon ger wait contributes to vaccine hesitancy; Consider deleting word \"also\" so it reads \"provides a minimal absolute risk reduction in severe anaphylaxis outcomes and may contribute to vaccine hesitancy\"\"; The words \"no history of anaphylaxis\" in Question 1 c ould be replaced by \"no history of allergic reactions\" to be consistent with what reported in both Recommendation 1 and 2; They are not at increased risk; I have had patients who will only get the vaccine because they can wait and others ask if they really have to stay; If it makes some patients safer to receive the vaccine this way, it can be recommended to increase vaccine compliance (i.e. SDM) Recommendation 3 : In patients with no history of anaphylaxis to SARS -CoV -2 vaccines or its excipients, we suggest against vaccine or vaccine excipient testing prior to vaccination prior to vaccination in an attempt to predict the rare individual who will have a severe allergic reaction to vaccination. . Strong recommendation; Low Certainty of Evidence. 94.4% Mean score: 4.82 There are patients who have had anaphylaxis to a chemotherapeutic agent who I would judge as meriting skin testing -- are they included in this statement?; strongly agree; Please note that in Table 4, the description of the Jonhson and Jonh son vaccine seems to be missing; For table 4, I do not recall seeing the Johnson and Johnson vaccine listed but maybe I missed it. For figure 2, would it be clearer to say incidence per ten thousand \"reports\" on the x axis? Otherwise, it may seem like the re are a lot more people with PEG allergy? Recommendation 4 : We suggest against the clinician routinely performing skin or in vitro testing using SARS -COV -2 vaccines or excipients outside of the research setting for the purposes of vaccine withholding , given such testing has unknown sensitivity/specificity in predicting severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, to SARS -CoV -2 vaccines . Conditional recommendation; Low Certainty of Evidence 88.9% Mean score: 4.51 The key word here is \"routinely\"; strongly agree; What is clear based on the literature is that anaphylaxis with confirmed sensitization to PEG is possible, can be demonstrated by skin testing and serum IgE. Just because PEG allergy is a relatively rare event, does not mean there is no val ue in doing testing if it can be done. It is hard to establish testing validity for rare events and apply it to more widely --unless testing on those who have had anaphylaxis were to actually be done on a wider level (which would help establish its validity ). This data should be collected as part of a research protocol, which isn't the same as saying don't do it at all.?; Given that Recommendation 4 is \"conditional with low certainty of evidence\" and that (line 473 -474) \"there is no elaboration on how the al lergy specialist should evaluate these patients to determine whether vaccination is advisable and how to proceed\" and that (Line 392 -393) \"testing may be considered as a preference sensitive option..\" Figure 3 should report this option somewhere either in the box on the right or in the footnote (something like Can consider skin testing to vaccine or excipient(s) however, predictive value of this testing is not known and is recommended to be limited to research contexts). Please note that in Table 2 there is a mistake as the Recommendation Strength is reported as \"Strong\" while in the main manuscript is reported as \"Conditional\"; This statement is too strong in my view. In many countries and clinical settings this recommendation is hard to implement. It is fa irly mentioned in the manuscript that ASCIA and WAO consider skin testing to the vaccine or its components an option. In the light of available evidence my suggestion would be to change the statement to \"we cannot suggest for or against...\" There is a sent ence in the manuscript \"While testing may be considered as a preference -sensitive option in shared decision -making, options for cautious administration of vaccine (Figure 3) or the use of an alternative vaccine with a different platform and excipient may b e more practical choices\" which also somehow contradicts recommendation in its' current form. ASCIA and WAO; NB: Table 2 has \"strong\" recommendation; in specialized units this may be performed even though there is no formal research project and may add to knowledge; For figure 3, it seems like boxes 1 and 2 only differ by 15 minute wait so risk of SARS -COV -2 are essentially the same. Should we add lack of availability of vaccines to specialist offices in this figure?; \"Routinely\" makes this question a \"1\" but feel this should be discussed, along with limits of sensitivity/specificity, with patient and some may wish to have testing. Routinely the answer is clearly a 1. Recommendation 5 : We recommend a shared decision -making paradigm of care favoring vaccin ation through full or graded dosing (with or without additional observation time post -vaccination) or changing vaccine platforms to another agent over no vaccination because there is no single best approach to assessment and management of the patient with a suspected SARS -CoV -2 mRNA or adenovirus vector vaccine reaction, or the patient with an allergy to an excipient 96.3% Mean score: 4.71 I'm on the fence with this one based on wording. Not sure whether we're talking about anaphylaxis when you say \"generalized systemic allergic reaction\"; I've had patients with urticaria who have gone on to receive round 2 with pretty much the same (and not m ore serious) reaction. Also, the statement states \"suspected\" vaccine reaction rather than actual reaction. Let me know if you wanna discuss this further; strongly agree; Figure 3: I would keep the red/green colors only in the 2 arrows, because the diffe rent colors in the 4 graphs create confusion and make it difficult to read the lines. Also in the last graph it is stated \"Unclear protective efficacy of a single dose\". It should Journal Pre-proof 4 in either of these vaccines who has not yet been vaccinated . Strong Recommendation; Moderate Certainty of Evidence be specified that this refers to the 2 doses vaccine and not the single dose (eg. Jonhson and Jonhson); For table 5, if we are using shared decision making, how can you blind a placebo dose for someone with anxiety?; Statement is too vague; For those with previous reactions to excipients, physicians should see if these excipients were tolerated in other vaccines or medicine too; Many physicians want a straightforward, \"cookbook\" answer and flow diagram on what to do with vaccine reactions. It is emphasized very well that individual physician judgment is essential and vital. Recom mendation 6 : In patients with suspected immediate allergic reaction to SARS -CoV -2 vaccine whose standard schedule requires more than one dose, we recommend referral to an allergist for assessment of additional vaccination over no/deferred vaccination Stro ng Recommendation; Moderate Certainty of Evidence 98.1% Mean score: 4.82 Strongly agree; In my opinion the recommendation as currently stated allows for wide interpretation in terms of the type of patient that is appropriate for referral to an allergist; Recommendation 6 and 8 seems very similar with regards to allergic reaction to SARS -COV2 vaccine; We allergists/immunologists are indeed the experts. Recommendation 7 : In patients with a suspected or confirmed but remote history of reaction to a vaccine excipient, we recommend referral to an allergist for assessment of additional vaccination over no vaccination/vaccination being withheld . In resource limited settings where specialist referral is not readily available, alternatives may be presented in a shared decision -making context to provide assessment and opportunity for vaccination by remote consultation, use of alternative vaccine products, or delay in vaccination until a solution can be determined. Strong Recommendation; Moderate Certainty of Eviden ce 98.1% Mean score: 4.78 Strongly agree; What do you mean by remote? Do you mean a non -local reaction? If so, suggest wording is changed to \"with a suspected or confirmed systemic reaction to a vaccine excipient\"; In my opinion the recommendation as curr ently stated allows for wide interpretation in terms of the type of patient that is appropriate for referral to an allergist; My only concern is that many allergists really may not know what to do; Strongly agree with statement but we options for the speci alist are limited other than a shared -decision making discussion. This is particularly a problem if the specialist does not have access to the vaccine. Recommendation 8 : In patients with a definite/confirmed recent allergic reaction to SARS -CoV -2 vaccine and/or excipient, we recommend referral to an allergist for assessment of additional vaccination over no vaccination/vaccination being withheld . In resource limited settings where specialist referral is not readily available, alternatives may be presented in a shared decision -making context to provide assessment and opportunity for vaccination by remote consultation, use of alternative vaccine products, or delay in vaccination until a solution can be determined. Strong Recommendation; Low Certainty of Evi dence 98.1% Mean score: 4.82 Strongly agree; Despite the clarified definition of allergic reaction as generalized and systemic I still believe that that the recommendation is open to wide interpretation. I thought the phrase used in earlier version was mo re appropriate : \": We recommend that an allergist -immunologist evaluation be considered as a possible path in support of such patients being vaccinated,\"; the strong likelihood here is that no further vaccine will be given Recommendation 9 : While all v accines should be administered in facilities capable of treating anaphylaxis, particularly for individuals with a prior immediate systemic allergic reaction to a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine or vaccine excipient, we recommend the clinician should administer SARS -CoV -2 mRNA or adenovirus vector vaccine in a setting equipped to manage anaphylaxis (e.g. hospital, mass immunization clinic, specialist office), under the supervision of personnel trained in the recognition and management of anaphylaxis. In resource limited settings where specialist referral is not readily available, alternatives may be presented in a shared decision -making context to provide assessment and opportunity for vaccination by remote consultation, use of alternative vaccine products, or delay in vaccination until a solution can be determined. Strong Recommendation; Moderate Certainty of Evidence 94.4% Mean score: 4.80 Patients who are candidates for the vaccine can be stratified such that higher risk patients observe this recommendation. For in dividuals in the gen'l population without risk factor(s), this is not necessary and would interfere with efforts to vaccinate rapidly to achieve herd immunity; If this is routine vaccination, this is not needed as we state the risk is so low. Probably need to reword if this in regards to prior vaccine reactors; strongly agree; should make the wording clearer to explain this is just for those with definite or confirmed reactions; I am not sure about the e.g. specialist part since most Covid vaccines are n ot given by specialists and most allergists I know cannot obtain vaccine for their offices. If we want to emphasize the specialist, we may need to emphasize making vaccine available to allergy specialist offices (maybe add somewhere in lines 501 -512); Rou tine vaccination should not require a specialist but the staff should be equipped to treat reactions. The \"e.g.\" confused me as to the intent of question; Only in those with a history of anaphylaxis Recommendation 10 : We suggest against routine H1-antihistamine or systemic corticosteroid pre -medication prior to vaccination as it has low certainty evidence in preventing anaphylaxis, and theoretically corticosteroid pre - medication could diminish the immune response. Conditional Recommendation; Low Certainty of Evidence 98.1% Mean score: 4.75 I believe this is more than \"theoretical\"; strongly agree; What saves this statement is the use of the word \"routine\". In the text can state if a high risk person needs vaccine and has reacted to first dose, thi s is sdm based on precedent for prevention of complement mediated reactions. As much evidence for this as graded challenges to vaccines being recommended; We studied this for DT vaccine years ago, some effect on primary, no significant effect of OCS on boo ster; one could argue H1 antihistamine is a VERY low risk med to use. Would have considered changing to strong rec against for steroids only; this leaves latitude to pretreat with an H1 antihistamine in anxious patients; True with regard to anaphylaxis, bu t may have value in decreasing local and non-anaphylactic reactions/side effects. Recommendation 11 : We recommend in favor of globally coordinated research studies being conducted to address i) vaccine and vaccine excipient testing diagnostic accuracy fo r allergy to SARS -CoV -2 vaccines; ii) administration of the vaccine to individuals with prior anaphylaxis to the vaccine or vaccine excipient; iii) the necessity of graded vaccine administration in the context of a patient with possible SARS -CoV -2 vaccine allergy; iv) the safety, efficacy, and necessity of mixing SARS -CoV -2 vaccine platforms; and v) the incremental benefit of additional doses of an mRNA or certain adenovirus -vector vaccines 100% Mean score: 4.96 Great job with this!!!; strongly agree; Line 342 in manuscript should be sensitivity not specificity. Recommendations 4 and 10 need some more elaboration in the text of the document; Good to work towards these studies; Outstanding, clinically relev ant points.

Tracy, Paul Turne r, Dana Wallace, Julie Wang, Susan Wasserman, Margitta Worm, Tim Vander Leek: iterative critical review of the manuscript, development of the questions and recommendations Journal Pre-proof 2 Supplemental Methods: Systematic Review Question Development, Protocol, and Sea rch Strategies 1) Question Development Prior to initiating a systematic review, 3 pre -specified questions were formulated for search, using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes) format. The populations for study included published data for patients without known SARS -CoV -2 vaccine reaction or vaccine excipient allergy seeking vaccination (questions 1 and 2) and patients with known (or suspected) SARS -CoV -2 vaccine reaction or vaccine excipient allergy seeking vaccination (question 3). The questions developed included the following: Question 1: What is the risk of a severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis, to a SARS - CoV -2 vaccine in a patient with no history of a severe allergic reaction to a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine or its excipients ? Population: Patients without known SARS -CoV -2 vaccine reaction or vaccine excipient allergy seeking vaccination Intervention: SARS -CoV -2 vaccination Comparator: Defer SARS -CoV -2 vaccination Outcome: Allergic reaction to a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine Question 2: In patients without a history of a severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis, to a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine or its excipients, should allergy skin testing to SARS -CoV -2 vaccines or its excipients be performed? Population: Patients without known SARS -CoV -2 vaccine reaction or vaccine excipient allergy seeking vaccination Intervention: Allergy skin testing to SARS -CoV -2 vaccines or its excipients (PEG, polysorbate 80) Comparator: Not performing allergy skin testing to SARS -CoV -2 vaccines or its excipie nts (PEG, polysorbate 80) Outcome: Allergic reaction to a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine Question 3: In patients with a history of a severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis, to a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine or its excipients, should allergy skin testing to SARS -CoV -2 vaccines or its excipients be performed to determine if vaccine withholding is needed? Population: Patients with a known SARS -CoV -2 vaccine reaction or vaccine excipient allergy seeking vaccination Intervention: Allergy skin testing to SARS -CoV-2 vaccines or its excipients (PEG, polysorbate 80) Comparator: Not performing allergy skin testing to SARS -CoV -2 vaccines or its excipients (PEG, polysorbate 80) Outcome: Allergic reaction to a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine A 4th question was formulated within t he PICO search for question 3, but not analyzed with meta -analysis. This was based on investigator pre -specified determination that this literature was evolving in real -time and at the time the search was initiated, that no known literature to answer this question existed. Journal Pre-proof 3 Question 4: Should SARS -CoV -2 mRNA or adenovirus vector vaccines be administered to an individual who had an immediate allergic reaction to the first dose of the vaccine (defined as a generalized, systemic allergic reaction with acute onset occurring within 4 hours of vaccine administration), or given as a first dose to an individual who is suspected to have reacted previously to an excipient ingredient that is also present in the SARS -CoV -2 mRNA or adenovirus vector vaccines? 2) Protocol 2021 -03-16 Anaphylaxis to SARS -CoV2 vaccines, excipients, and diagnostic test accuracy Derek Chu, Matthew Gree nhawt, Marcus Shaker, David Golden, Elissa Abrams, Antonio Bognanni, Anna Whalen -Browne Review question 1. What is the risk of anaphylaxis to SARS -CoV2 vaccination? 2. What is the risk of polyethylene glycol and polysorbate allergy? 3. What is the diagnostic test accuracy of polyethylene glycol and polysorbate skin testing to diagnose allergy to these respective molecules? Searches The following data bases will be searched since inception (date of search, 19 Mar, 2021) 1. MEDLINE 2. Embase 3. WHO Global Coronavirus database 4. COVID NMA Vaccine RCT evidence map We will also use Web of Science (all databases) forward and backward citation analysis of any relevant study. We will also search government websites and press releases for 50 countries with most vaccinations per OurWorldInData No restrictions in language and period. Types of study to be included For risk of anaph ylaxis and excipient allergy: RCTs and observational studies, including adverse event reporting systems For diagnostic test accuracy: Any study design Journal Pre-proof 4 Condition or domain being studied People at risk for anaphylaxis to SARS -CoV2 vaccines Participants/popu lation General public Intervention(s), SARS risk of vaccine anaphylaxis or excipient allergy: Those not receiving SARS -CoV2 vaccine, though we anticipate that the majority of the data to answer this questi on optimally will come form adverse event reporting systems, which do not have a control arm. For diagnostic test accuracy: 2x2 tables will be generated for true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives. Context Worldwide Main outcome(s) Respectively per question 1. Risk of vaccine induced anaphylaxis 2. Risk of excipient allergy 3. Sensitivity and specificity Measures of effect For questions 1 and 2, absolute measures of risk For question 3, sensitivity and specificity Additional outcome(s) None Measures of effect None Data extraction (selection and coding) Screening and Selection of studies Title and abstract screening, selection of full texts, data extraction and risk of bias assessments will be performed independently in duplicate. All conflicts will be resolved by discussion and if cannot be resolved by discussion with a third reviewer. We will use Covidence for screening. Journal Pre-proof 5 Data extraction Data extraction will occur independently and in duplicate. Any disagreement wil l be resolved by discussion, and if needed, a third author. We will extract, apart from the outcome measures, study characteristics including Author, year, country (ies), study design, definition of anaphylaxis (including adjudicated versus not). Risk of bias (quality) assessment Risk of bias assessment will use done per question using the most appropriate tool. For questions 1 and 2 addressing risk, we will use the JBI risk of bias tool for prevalence studies. For the diagnostic test accuracy question, w e will use QUADAS -2. Strategy for data synthesis Given that we anticipate the events to be rare and of risks, we will meta -analyze proportions by logistic -normal random effects. Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using the GRADE approach, as I2 will likely be misleading in pooling large observational studies. Given the likelihood for sparse data for diagnostic test accuracy with zeros in the more than one cell of the 2x2 table, we anticipate specificity to be falsely high, and will report raw poole d sensitivity specificity across trials. Supplemental analyses may use a Bayesian approach. Analysis will be done using Stata 14.3. We will use the GRADE approach (GRADE Working Group. GRADE home. Available from: http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org) will be u sed for rating the overall quality of evidence. Analysis of subgroups or subsets 1. Anaphylaxis to be higher among studies with no clear adjudication of anaphylaxis, as there are many mimickers of anaphylaxis. 2. mRNA vaccines are more likely than other types of vaccines to cause anaphylaxis. All subgroup analyses will employ tests for interaction. Type and method of review Intervention, Meta -analysis, Systematic review Anticipated or actual start date 19 March 2021 Anticipated completion date 26 March 2021 Journal Pre-proof 6 Fund ing sources/sponsors None 3) Literature Selection and Search Strategy Five reviewers screened records independently and in duplicate using Covidence, for initial inclusion, full text inclusion, and final inclusion for data extraction. A total of two reviewers were minimally required to render a decision for any abstract, and a threshold of 2 votes to include or exclude a particular abstract was used. Conflicts were resolved by direct discussion between the conflicting reviewers. Search terms were generated by DC, AB, and AWB. Inclusion criteria included human studies only, clinical studies of >20,000 patients for reporting allergic reactions to SARS -CoV -2 or vaccination data from country specific datasets reporting >500,000 vaccines, for any type of SARS -CoV -2 vaccine platform (question 1); clinical studies or data reporting sources detailing a patient or physician reported national level dataset for drug allergy to PEG of any molecular weight and in any form or any form of polysorbate (question 2); and any study or case series reporting skin testing (prick, percutaneous, and /or intradermal testing) to any molecular weight and concentration of PEG or polysorbate in which negative controls were also tested, and where true/false negatives as well as true/false positives were reported, inclusive of any testing threshold to denote sensitization. Exclusion criteria for question 1 included reports/studies smaller than the pre -specified threshold; for question 2 included case reports or case series not derived from large, centralized data collection systems or from single centers; and for question 3 included studies and series that did not report negative control subjects were also tested, did not report the size of the test, that described atopy patch testing for contact dermatitis, or that related to testing of a reaction to PEGalate d chemotherapy where it was not distinctly clear that the PEG or the chemotherapy were the provoking agent.
