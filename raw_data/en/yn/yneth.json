How is homeopathy effective for asthma? Asthma is a long-term condition that affects the airways in the lungs. The airways are the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. People suffering from asthma face difficulty in breathing as it becomes harder for the air to move out of the airways. Asthma is triggered by allergens such as pollen, mold, dust mites and irritants such as smoke, chemicals, perfumes, certain medications, physical activities, stress, and cold and humid weather. One study found that adding homeopathic remedies to the treatment of asthma in 140 adults was more effective than regular treatment. Treatments for asthma The treatment of asthma completely depends on the age, severity, triggers and how the body reacts to the medicines. Asthma is classified as intermittent, mildly persistent, moderately persistent, and severely persistent. If your health worsens, consult a doctor and receive treatment. Asthma treatments fall into the following categories: - Quick-relief medicines are prescribed in case of mild asthma or asthma with physical activity. - Long-term control medications are given to reduce the severity of symptoms. - Biologics are a newer class of medications that target specific immune pathways and molecules involved in asthma's inflammatory process. Homeopathic medicines for asthma Despite being a chronic allergic inflammatory condition, asthma is treatable mainly with homeopathy. Homeopathy treatment for asthma is the most effective and safe method of treatment, and here are the leading homeopathic medicines for asthma: - Arsenic Album It is one of the best homeopathic medicines for asthma.
