Many women can relate to this feeling before or during their monthly cycle, which is where Dong Quai supports from several different angles.* Benefits & Uses - Supports healthy, balanced hormones - Helps ease minor symptoms to PMS - Aids a normal, positive mood during your menstrual cycle - Supports mild blemishes before and during your cycle related to hormone health - Assists mild cramps and smooth flow - Contains herbs known as hormone modulators or supporters, along with HPA axis regulating botanicals for a top-down approach* Liver support is key Proper liver function is essential to overall health as your liver helps remove waste products, metabolizes hormones, and aids in the elimination of environmental substances.
