Sonderegger Accepted in the fall semester 2017 on the recommendation of Prof. Dr. Ulrike Ehlert and Prof. Dr. Reinhard Saller Zurich, 2017 i \u00abThe most exciting phrase to hear in scien ce, is not \u00abEureka!\u00bb but rather \u00abThat's funny\u00bb. This quotation which is attributed to Sir Isaac Asimov summarizes well my passion for science. It is not to just discover anticipated facts, but rather to stand in awe in front of a phenomenon, unknowing and simply struck by what manifests. Then start the process of understanding. I am greatly indebted to Professor Ulrike Ehlert for the chance to realize this research project at her department. It was only with her continueing support and help that this resea rch project has become possible. Also I would like to extend my deep gratitude to Professor Reinhard Saller who inspired me in the beginning of this journey as well as support- ing me in finding the financial support which enabled us to move into the directi on of \u00abEureka!\u00bb . Science, especially in less prominent areas, is only possible when organizations and individuals fund it. For the diversity as well as the p rogress of science it is imperative that non-monetary driven organizations contribute in research p rojects that might aid in the future. Therefore, I am very grateful to the Zurich based \"Foundation for Complementary Medicine\" that they have trusted us with their funds and laid the foundation of the project . Furthermore , I would like to thank Dr. Elvira Abbruzze se for her contagious enthusiasm and constructive insights to elevate this work to where it is today . This piece of work would not have been possible with out the help of Emilou Noser, Tabea Lerch and Regula Zueger who have done a great job in the administration of the project. Finally I would like to thank my wife Martina for her everlasting support throughout these years. It has been quite a journey and without her neither this project nor my other engage- ments would be possible. Having found the piece that one makes complete is maybe the greatest gift of all. A constant inspiration and source of energy are Timothy and Miles who have contributed more to my life than they will ever know. And last but not least I owe gratitude to my parents. My mothe r Rosmarie has taught me many things but above all it has been \"wonder\" that is the most important . And lastly, this is for my father Werner. You have always been there - open hearted, supporting, caring and loving. It is now through you that I understand the true meaning of parental love. Lars B.

Thus, efficient and effective interventions that are able t o inoculate people against stress before ailments manifest are pivotal. The purpose of the present study was twofold: First, an effectiveness study was performed to evaluate the effects of kinesiolo - gy (a mind -body intervention within complementary medicin e) and cognitive -behavioral stress management (CBSM) on psychological well -being as well as the response to an acute stressor. Second, a test procedure was reviewed which might be utilized for rigorous evalua- tions of complementary medicine methods. Therefo re, a randomized controlled study was performed to evaluate the effects of kinesiology and cognitive -behavioral stress management (CBSM). Methods: Seventy healthy participants were randomly assigned to CBSM training, kinesiolo- gy training or a control cond ition. To evaluate training effects, psychometric and physiologi- cal measures were obtained. Stress reactivity of salivary free cortisol during the TSST was defined as the primary outcome measure. Secondary measures were the development of the psychometric assessments over the course of the study: depressive symptoms (ADS -K), perceived stress (PSS), stress reactivity (SRS), sense of coherence (SOC), self -concept (FKK) and self -efficacy (SWE). These psychometric components were measured before and after the training period. The control group received a training after the study was concluded. Results: The protocol proved to be effective. However, blinded randomization was associated with substantial group differences at the outset of the study. The kinesiology group exhibited a significantly higher depression score than the other groups. While the groups did not differ in the TSST, evidence found in the post -measurement suggested improved resilience of the stress management group (SMG). The SMG exhibited desira ble outcomes in depressive affect and perceived stress, improved self -concept and perceived self -efficacy as well as an im -proved sense of coherence. Abstract viii Conclusion: We conclude from this study that a) the study protocol could be ameliorated by utilizing sof tware for more elaborated allocation methods when n is small, which in turn may lead to more evenly balanced groups regarding the most important psychometric characteris - tics; b) it would be interesting to investigate the hypothesis that individual coping resources might be seen as a moderator affecting the strength of the relationship between the training and the responsiveness to training; and c) future studies are necessary to examine the impact of kinesiology as a method for stress management. PART I: THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 1 PART I: THEORETICAL BACKGROUND This chapter aims to provide the framework that supports the understanding of the sci entific rationale of the presented project. In order to do so a historical perspective of the concept of stress is presented, followed by up-to-date knowledge on the pathways of stress as well as the effects of psychosocial stress on physica l and mental he alth. Then, potential stress reducing interventions are presented and a cognitive -behavioral as well as a kinesiological approach in detail introduced and discussed. 1 Evolution and development of the concept of stress Stress is oftentimes discussed as a m odern phenomenon. However, this is not the case. People have dealt with stress and its implications for as long as humans have existed. Understanding the development of the concept may elucidate the topic from a different perspective. The brief historical approach will be divided in three parts. Firstly, the stress phenomenon today will be discussed and, secondly the historical development from ancient civilizations to greek philosophers shall be outlined, thirdly then the mediaeval are focused on, to then end with the renaissance and the development of stress concepts in the 20st century. 1.1 The stress phenomenon today Only few scientific terms have become so prominent that they are being used from kindergar- ten until senior homes. A New York Times columnist put it this way: Stress is a word that is as useful as a Visa card and as satisfying as a Coke. It's non -commital and also non - commitable\" (Shweder, 1997). It's a constant factor in modern life and a frequent conversa- tion topic. It has become an inflatio nary concept with vast comprehension and meaning. It can mean excitement and challenge (positive stress\"), while it can also reflect an undesirable Evolution and development of the concept of stress 2 state (bad stress\") of worry, frustration and feelings of anxiety because they threaten one's security or push one beyond the ability to successfully cope (McEwen, 2016). Therefore, stress\" is an ambigous term and what most people are concerned about when they talk about stress is the state of being stressed out\" (McEwen, 2005) and what it is that \"stresses them out\". Oftentimes it is only secondary what can be done to reduce it and only in the end of the cognitive rationale the question arises how it could be avoided altogether . The universal embracing of the concept to this day goes to prove that it refers not only to an important theoretical problem, but also touches on a real and critical aspect of life (Milczarek et al., 2009). For Chrousos et al. (1988) the term has prevailed because it attempts to address a basic principle of nature, that of maintenance of balance, equilibrium or harmony in the face of disturbing forces on the one hand and counteracting reestablishing forces on the other. It can be summarized that stress is a socio -cultural phenomenon and for once one that unites the interests of the gen eral public as well as the scientific community in various fields. 1.1.1 Economic impact of the stress phenomenon It also concerns governments and social policy makers (Milczarek et al., 2009) as the impact of the phenomenon stress has significant economic impo rtance. While predominantly dis- cussed in mental health stress itself is not a disorder, but a symptom which may be prevalent and relevant factor also in somatic diseases. Non -communicable diseases (NCD) impose a large economic burden on human health worldw ide. As one of the main categories of the NCD mental health costs are the largest single cause - larger than cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, cancer or diabetes (Insel, 2008; Bloom et al., 2011). Concurrent the Global Burden of Disease Study found 2013 substantial consistency in the top disease causes: major depressive disorder and low back pain were among the ten causes of years lived with disability (YLDs) in every country (Vos et al., 2015). According to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2011) mental illnesses are also the leading causes of disability adjusted life years (DALYs), accounting for 37% of healthy years lost from NCDs. They are among the most life restricting with adverse effects to all areas of life of those affected dir ectly, as well as those supporting them. For 2010, the global cost of mental health conditions was estimated by Bloom et al. (2011) at US$ 2.5 trillion, with the cost projected to surge to US$ Evolution and development of the concept of stress 3 6.0 trillion by 2030. This global threat and core health challe nge of the 21st century (Wittchen et al., 2011) has a regional correlate. In the latest Swiss Health Observatory (Obsan) Monitor- ing report, Schuler and Burla (2012) have shown that 17% of the Swiss population is suffer- ing from one or more mental illness an d the number of people with symptoms that do not yet fulfill the criteria of a diagnose but already suffer is even higher. Also, psychosocial as well as work -related stress are widespread. In 2010 34% of the swiss working population felt \"often to very oft en\" stressed (Grebner et al., 2011). Compared to a previous study by the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) ten years earlier (Ramaciotti & Perriard, 200 3) this number increased 30% during this time. Meanwhile the amount of people that fel t \"never or sometimes\" stressed diminished in the same period (Grebner et al., 2011). Stress is consid- ered by a large body of literature to play an important role in the expression of various psychological (Clark et al., 2012) and physiological conditions. In the light of these facts the growing interest of the scientific community is almost self -explanatory and can be seen in the rising number of publications in Pubmed over the last 20 years. Figure 1: Development of publicati ons with the keyword stress\" in PubMed Evolution and development of the concept of stress 4 While described as an economic burden, stress causes suffering on the individual level as well. Solutions to this epidemic has brought to rise a whole industry with stress manage- ment\" bein g part of the well -being and self -improvement industry. This a tremendous market which has been estimated to be around 8.5 billion US$ market ( Banks, 2012 ). The business with stress management\" brings upon everything from eastern gurus\" to western stressolo- gists\" that claim thei r work leads to better stress -coping and well -being often without evi- dence of effectiveness. More so , the underlying assumptions of many stress management programs are outdated conceptualizations of stress and not contemporary knowledge about the subject. The need for solutions to cope with the challenges of daily life seems to have created a demand that does not orient itself primarily on whether a method has shown to be successful but other deciding elements. With a demand to find solutions so high, it may be questions if there was stress before the term was coined in the 20st century? While stress is seen as something modern, it has a longer history than might be anticipated. It is plausible to argue that the stress reaction as integral part of the biol ogical system has always been part of mankind in evolution . Interestingly, the idea of stress has already been mentioned over 500 years ago. 1.2 A historical view of the concept of stress The history of a term shows the development of a concept over time, while the etymology of the term is concerned with the term's origin and literal meaning. For the word \"stress\" its origins lie in the latin word \"stringere\" which means \"tight, compressed, drawn together\". In Middle French \"estrecier \" meant \"to subject (someo ne) to force or compulsion\" and \"stress\" was a shortform of \"destresse\" (Harper, 2016). In Middle English \"destresse\" and \"stresse\" were synonymously used and meant hardship, adversity, force, pressure (McEwen & Norton, 2002). It is notable that while \"str ess\" is seen as modern, it is deeply rooted in the history of mankind and while the conceptualizations have changed over time its inner meaning has remained. Evolution an d development of the concept of stress 5 1.2.1 From ancient civilizations to greek philosophers In ancient civilizations medicine was characteriz ed by religious and magical convictions. The development of diseases was attributed to the influence of supernatural powers such as gods and spirits (Fornaro et al., 2009) . In accord with those beliefs healing was sought in magical properties. With the ris e of the natural philosophers in the fifth century B.C. medicine underwent a disruptive period and a new paradigm developed. This new paradigm is the basis of modern medicine and also the understanding of stress. The greek philosopher Empedocles about 450 B.C. considered all matter as a mixture of essential elements existing together in a state of harmonious balance (Chrousos et al., 1988). The first reference to disturbed homeo- stasis and what today might be known as stressors was by Hippocrates in 400 B.C. He considered diseases as states of disequilibrium and imbalance and ascribed natural causes to diseases, therefore defining them as stressors (Chrousos et al., 1988). Disease was not seen any more as passive suffering, but as a challenge for the body to defend itself and reinstall its functions (Selye, 1976). The greek word \"homeostasis\" means \" steady state and meant the steady, harmonious state of mind and body. Hippocrates was the first to talk about the adaptive responses of the body and introduced th e concept of the healing forces of nature, later called by the Romans \"vis medicatrix naturae\" (C hrousos et al., 1988). The doctors task was seen to support the innate self -healing process with different treatment methods. Table 1: The chronology of stres s as a concept Empedocles 500 - 430 B.C. Matter consists of essential elements and qualities in opposition or alliance to one another Hippocrates 460 - 375 B.C. A harmonious balance of the elements and qualities of life is health - disharmony is diseas e. Sydenham 1624 - 1689 Symptoms and signs of a disease arise also from the reaction of the patient's system. Robert Hook 1635 - 1703 Hooke's law: Law of elasticity which is concerned with how physical structures withstand heavy loads. The term stre ss surfaced in physics. George Beard 1839 - 1883 Connection between nervous disorders and everyday life. Definition of neurasthenia as medical condition with exhaustion of the central nervous system's energy, which was attributed to social life and civilization. Evolution and development of the concept of stress 6 Claude Bernard 1813 - 1878 Originated the term \"milieu int\u00e9rieur\": the principle of a dynamic internal physiological equilibrium. Walter Cannon 1871 - 1945 Termed the \"fight or flight reaction\", as well as coined the concept of \"homeostasis\" . Hans Selye 1907 - 1982 \"The general adaptation syndrome\": the non -specific response of an organism to stressors. John Mason 1924 - 2014 The HPA axis response is not a unvarying reflex, but one that may be influenced by istics the bidirectionality of the stress response and the importance of individual variability in it. Richard Lazarus 1922 - 2002 The stress response must be influenced by emotions and personal meaning because t he same stressor di d not reliably evoke a stress response in different individuals. 1.2.2 Mediaeval times - or birth of the term stress With the fall of the roman Empire there was significant change in the practice and teaching of medicine. T he development of \"monch medicine\" in the fifth and sixth century D.C. which was a combination of germanic folk medicine and fragments of medicine from ancient times (Porter, 1999). According to Gelo et al. (2014) the important concept during this time was iatrotheological , this meaning that sickness was often considered a punishment from higher powers for a violation of rules of commandments. Even if natural causes were present the disease was attributed to a divine plan. In the eleventh century medicine shifted to univers ities because clericals were prohibited to practice medicine (Porter, 1999). While this time period is not the period of great importance to the development of medicine, it is relevant because the term stress emerges for the first time. In a fourteenth cen tury poem by Robert zu Brunne the word \"stress\" may be mentioned for time : \"That floure ys kalled 'aungelys mete` That God gave the folk to ete When they were yn wyldernes Forty wyntyr, yu hard stres\" Evolution and development of the concept of stress 7 This was the poets interpretation of the he avenly manna sent to the Israelites as they wan- dered in the desert (McEwen & Norton, 2002). It is obvious that the word \"stres\" in this context had no positive meaning and it may be interpreted that the meaning was more in the direction of burden or hardsh ip. While usage of the term in this time might have been differ- ent then today it is still astonishing that it has been used in a way that it is similar to today's usage. Burden, strain and social as well as economic hardship are external factors that make life more challenging and today at least the lay population uses the term mostly in this direction. 1.2.3 From Renaissance to the 20th century While the development in medicine in the Renaissance brought upon various discoveries such as the contributions in ana tomy of Andreas Vesalius, or the works in cardiovascular research of William Harvey especially one is relevant for the development of the concept of stress (Heinrichs, 2006 ; Toledo -Pereyra, 2015 ). In the years of the Renaissance Thomas Sydenham extended th e Hippocratic concept of disease as a systematic disharmony brought about by disturbing forces, when he suggested that an individual's adaptive response to such forces could itself be capable of producing pathological changes (Chrousos & Gold , 1992). An id ea that would later become relevant for the science of stress. The renaissance did develop the science of medicine but it stayed bound to the principles of the classical era . It was with the emergence of the \"new science\" with a mechanistic worldview an d the experimental approaches that a disruptive step was established . This was the basis for the development of modern medicine (Heinrichs, 2006). The idea that the human body resembles a machine has its roots in the idea of Aristoteles. But this mechanist ic view revived in the seventeenth century with its most prominent proponent Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596 -1650). The conviction of the mechanistic worldview was that the mechanisms and laws of the non -living world also apply to humans (Porter, 1999). In this era t he term stress emerged from everyday language and became a scientific terminus by the works of Robert Hook. The physicist and biologist Hooke was concerned with how man -made structures (e.g. bridges) could be made Evolution and development of the concept of stress 8 to withstand heavy loads and resist buffet ing by winds, earthquakes, and other natural forces that threaten their stability (Cooper & Dewe, 2004 ; Lazarus, 1993). For Hook load referred to a weight on a structure, stress was the area over which the load impinged, and strain was the deformation of the structure created by the interplay of both load and stress (Lazarus, 1993). This has become known as the Law of elasticity . Despite the difficulties involved in the transition from physics to other disciplines, the similarities of these terms with cont emporary terms are astounding. Hook's analysis influenced early 20th century models of stress in physiology, psychology, and sociology tremendously. The theme that survived into modern times is that stress is an external demand placed on a bio -psycho -socia l system (Lazarus, 1993). The conviction of the body as machine -like, proved to be fertile ground for two other ideas. Firstly, if the body were like a machine and machines are subject to wear and tear, then the same might hold true for the body. If machin es deteriorated it was assumed that the same might be true for humans. The discourse then shifted towards the impact on the body of the wear and tear of life (Doublet, 2000). Secondly, the analogy led to the idea that like a machine the body would need ene rgy to help it function. Depending on the amount of this energy, the body will, like a machine, perform well, poorly, or even stop (Cooper & Dewe, 2004). Just as every machine needs energy to properly function, it was assumed that this had to be true for humans to. For humans it was assumed that the nerve cells would produce this energy (Doublet, 2000). The quickening pace of life and the impact this was having on health and well-being led to the fear that the human nervous system was ill -adapted to cope wi th the increased complexity of modern life (Cooper & Dewe, 2004). Doublet (2000) reports that writers of the time concluded that \"at least a third of all diseases were of nervous origin\". The noted American physician George Beard suggested that pressing de mands of nineteenth - century life may lead to a circuit overload of the nervous system and he described this state as \"neurasthenia\" - a weakness of the nervous system leading nervous exhaustion. Cooper and Dewe (2004) see Beard's work as important because he helped to remove the social disap- proval attached to ailments like anxiety, unaccountabl e fatigue and irrational fears but even more importantly he attempted to focus on the role played by society in the production of mental illness. During the same tim e period Claude Bernard (1813 -1878) extended the notion of harmony or the steady state, initially posited by Thomas Sydenham during the Renais- sance, by introducing the concept of \"milieu int\u00e9rieur\", or the principle of a dynamic internal Evolution and development of the concept of stress 9 physiological equi librium (Chrousos & Gold, 1992). Bernard's idea was that the internal environment of living organisms must remain fairly constant in response to changes in the external environment (Selye, 197 3). Therefore, the internal medium of the living organism could not be merely a vehicle for carrying nourishment to the cell, but rather \"it is the fixity of the milieu int\u00e9rieur which is the condition of free and independent life\" (\"La fixit\u00e9 du milieu int\u00e9reiur est la condition de la vie libre, independante.\") Bernar d described the physiological capacity of the extra -cellular fluid environment to compensate for external variations with the purpose of maintaining and equilibrating the internal environment and hence maintaining the vital condition (Gross, 1998). Accordi ng to Bernard survival is determined by consistent maintenance of the internal environment via \"continual compensatory reactions\" (Doublet, 2000). The idea of \"milieu int\u00e9rieur\" therefore refers also to the idea that nothing within the body must be allowed to deviate too far from its normal equilibrium; if something does, then the individual will become ill or may even die (Selye, 1973). The importance of Bernard's work is best summarized by McEwen and Norton (2002): \"He introduced the thinking that eventua lly led to the concept, and science, of stress.\" 1.2.4 Development of stress concepts in the 20st century On the basis of Bernard's work, Walter Bradford Cannon (1871 -1945) coined the term \"homeostasis\" (from the Greek homoios, or similar, and stasis, or posit ion) and popularized it in his book Wisdom of the Body (Cannon, 1932). The author described in greater detail how the internal environment is regulated by an organism to equilibrate internal and external demands, maintaining stable conditions. Moreover, Ca nnon suggested that any threats to homeostasis cause a sympathoadrenal activation (Goldstein & Kopin, 2007). Already in 1914 he had described the \"emergency reaction\", involving the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, in his concept of \"fight -or-flight\". Whenever an organism perceives a threatening stimulus, a pattern of physiological changes helps the organism to adapt quickly to the situation. The preparation of the organism for fighting or fleeing involves, among other things, a rise in catecho lamines, an increase in heart rate, breathing frequency and blood pressure as well as dilatation of the pupils, reduced secretion of saliva and vasoconstriction Evolution and development of the concept of stress 10 (Abbruzzese, 2011). This concept of an emergency reaction was extended by Hans Selye (1907 -1982 ). Selye's contribution to the field of stress is one of great importance as his research had an extraordinary impact on biology and medicine (Mason, 1975). Newton (1995) described Selye as a \"celebrant of stress\" and possibly no person in recent times has influ- enced stress theory and research more than he has (Lazarus, 1977). However, it is noticeable that in Selye's prewar mainstream articles not one of them made any reference to \"stress\" (Newton, 1995). Later h e introduced the concept of stress to descri be the reaction of an organism to a threat of the inner equilibrium. Selye assumed that stress is a complex, but nonspecific pattern (Ehlert, 2003). Figure 2: The three phases of General Adaptation Syndrome (Selye, 1973 ) Selye proposed the \"General Ada ptation Syndrome\" consisting of three universal stages of coping with a stressor - an alarm , a resistance and an exhaustion phase (Selye, 1936). In the initial alarm phase, which is analogous to Cannon's \"fight or flight\" response, the body is prepared to deal with threatening situations. The homeostasis is disturbed, and therefore the sympathetic nervous system and as a consequence the adrenal medulla, are activated and the emergency activation is induced. Along with the sympathoadrenergic system, another, slower system is triggered: the hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal axis. This activation leads to a steep increase of glucocorticoid levels and as a consequence of this process, immunosuppressive effects can be observed (Goldstein & Kopin, 2007; Selye, 1950). In the resistance phase complex adaptive reactions are intensified to restore the inner equilibrium. However, if the stress situation endures, the parasympathic nervous system is activated as a counter -steering Evolution and development of the concept of stress 11 process, diminishing the dominance of the sy mpathic nervous system. However, catechola- mine and GC levels remain high. In the exhaustion phase, the adaptive capacity is exhausted and the body encounters serious problems in allocating energy, resulting in adaptation problems (Selye, 1950; Ehlert, 2003 ). For Selye it was clear that not all states of stress were noxious and he distinguished this by coining the terms \"eustress\" a nd \"distress\". He believed that mild, brief, and controllable states of challenged homeostasis could be perceived as positive to emotional and intellectual growth. Contrary to this was \"physical and emotional distress\" which was more severe, uncontrollable and protracted that he believed led to disease states (Chrousos & Gold, 1992). Later a different approach was taken in in the early 1950s, an era where psychology focused on understanding human behavior by first understanding simple organisms engaging in simple behaviors learned by rewards or punishment (Fink, 2009). Mason (1968, 1975) was able to document substantial variation in elements of the GAS response as a function of the individual, its history as well as the situation. This led to questions regarding the specifity of the \"nonspecific\" GAS response ( Ganzel et al., 2010). Furthermore, he discovered that whenever ist was p ossible to substantially reduce or remove the noxious \"psychological collateral variables\" of the stressor the GAS response failed to appear. In 1975 Mason concluded: \"The knowledge that the psyche is superimposed upon the humoral ma- chinery for endocrine regulation drastically complicates our whole view.\" (Mason, 1975) Similarily, Rich ard S. Lazarus and colleagues were surprised to find that one and the same stressful event did not reliably evoke a stress response. It was reasoned that the stress re- sponse must be influenced by emotions and by personal meaning of the potentially stressful situation (Lazarus et al., 1952). Consequently, he posited a new stress paradigm which became to be known as the transactional theory of stress and integrated cognitions a s mediat- ing process. This model has then been further developed and extended. Evolution and development of the concept o f stress 12 The history of the term stress began in medieval times as part of vernacular language , then it was \"borrowed \" by physics where it was used to describe how physical materials re act to external force and was later taken aback into social sciences and everyday language. Principles of stress: models, physiology and measurement 13 2 Principles of stress: models, physiology and measurement What Hermann Ebbinghaus stated for psychology as such is, slightly amended, true for stress as well: Stre ss has a long past, but only a short history. As stress is a psycho biological pattern to react to life and the perception of it, the science and theoretical conceptualization of the subject is relatively new. At the initial stage of a new research field sc ience may be (mostly) observational, but this phase should, according to Popper (1959), then give way to a more theory - and model -based stage that provide insights and direction to guide future develop- ments. Therefore, the most discussed models of stress, the physiological basis as well as the possibilities to measure stress are indispensable in order to depict the theoretical field of stress comprehensively. This is the focus of the first chapter following. Thereafter, it will be shown that the stress rea ction has a biological foundation that seems to have been an evolutionary advantage. The popular perception of stress is mostly encompassed by symptoms such as agitation, irritability, anxiety, feelings of hopelessness or fatigue . However, there is a root that leads to this perception that may be summarized as \" feeling stressed out\". This cause is referred to in the academic framework as stressor. While in the popular framework of stress the stressor per se is seen as the cause to being \"stressed out\", the academic field focuses on what happens within the mind/body system that leads to a stress response and consequently behavior. Therefore, it will be shown that stress has two compo- nents: a situation or event that may be perceived as burdensome and then the reaction to it. How the individual deals with the challenge then is referred to as stress management or coping (Ehlert et al., 2013 ; Lazarus, 1993 ). In order to depict a clear picture the models of stress will be outlined and following the physiological ba sis as well as the measurement. 2.1 Models of stress The stress models that have guided research and thinking have mostly been developed in the 19th and 20st century. The theories differ substantially in their view of the topic. While one Principles of stress: models, physiology and measurement 14 cluster of theories perceives stress as the source of burden, for another cluster it is primarily a specific reaction to it and for the third cluster it is about the association between the stimulus and its reaction to it. In short: Stress has been viewed as a response , a stimulus, and a trans- action . 2.1.1 Stress as a response (Cannon, Selye) Walter Cannon (1932) may have been the first modern researcher to frame stress as a re- sponse model. Cannon was principally concerned with the effects of cold, lack of oxygen, and other environ mental stressors on organisms. He reasoned that even though low level stressors could be withstood, prolonged or severe stressors may lead to a breakdown of biological systems (Hobfoll, 1989). Selye (1976) continued with the theoretical frame of stress as a response. He depicted stress as an orchestrated defense operated by physiological systems designed to protect the body from environmental challenge to bodily processes (Hobfoll, 1989). Selye described stress as a physiological response and therefore a de pendent variable with three concepts: Stress is a defensive mechanism Stress follows three stages : alarm, resistance, and exhaustion. If str ess is prolonged or severe, it may result i n diseases of adaptation Selye postulated the General Adaptation Synd rom (GAS) which describes three stages: The alerting response, resistance, and exhaustion. He felt that there was a common reaction to outside stressors following the sequence of the three stages (Hobfoll, 1989). Selye's assump- tion of uniformity of respons e has been challenged by Lazarus and Folkman (1984) or Mason (1968, 1975) . In the response -centered models research emphasis is mainly on the reaction patterns and the stimulus constellation is of minor interest. Principles of stress: models, physiology and measurement 15 2.1.2 Stress as a stimulus (Caplan, Holmes & Rah e, Lindemann ) The stimulus -oriented models of stress are diametric to the response models. The focus here lies on what causes stress, the nature of it - the stressors. The theory of stress as a stimulus was introduced in the 1960s, and viewed stress as a s ignificant life event or change that demands response, adjustment, or adaptation (Stangor & Walinga, 2010) . Holmes and Rahe (1967) created the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS) consisting of forty -two life events scored according to the estimated deg ree of adjustment they would each demand of the person experiencing them (e.g. death of a loved one , marriage / divorce, change or loss of job). The problem with this theoretical approach is that it assumes the following: Change is inherently stressful Life events demand the same levels of a djustment across the population There is a common threshold of adjustment b eyond which illness will result Therefore, events are considered stressful on the basis of whether they normatively lead to stress. If a stimu lus mostly leads to emotional upset, psychological distress, or physical impairment or deterioration, the stimulus is said to be a stressor (Hobfoll, 1989). The individ- ual person was therefore viewed as a passive recipient to stress and the model ignored important variables of the individual (e.g., life experience, prior learning, support networks, personality). While the theory as such has its limitations, Hobfoll (1989) singles out that by creating a taxonomy of stressful event an anchor point by which t he differences in how people react can be compared and through which the nature of the events can then be further catego- rized. Outlining events that are likely to lead to stress responses limits the world of events that would need to be studied and may giv e the opportunity to focus research on areas that concern a significant amount of people. Principles of stress: models, physiology and measurement 16 Figure 3: Theories of stress as response, stimulus, and transaction (Stangor & Walinga, 2010) 2.1.3 Stress as a transaction (Lazarus, Lazarus and Folkman ) An important perspective that is influential to stress researchers to the present time and maybe the most commonly adopted is the transactional theory of stress and coping (Lazarus, 1966; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). Lazarus (1966) was convinced that the perception of st ress was significantly dependent on the individual's evaluation of a situation. He published an elegant integration of previous research on stress, health, and coping that placed a person's appraisal of a stressor as well as the perception of one's own re sources at the center of the stress experience. For Lazarus and Folkman (1984) stress is not the product of imbalance between demands and response capacity but the individual's perception of these factors. According to how the individual appraises a stress or determines the coping reaction with or to the stressor. Therefore, if a stressor is experienced as discomforting this is influenced by a variety of personal and contextual factors including capacities, skills and abilities, constraints, resources, and n orms (McVicar et al., 2013) . The model has been modified and extended over the years Lazarus and Folkman (1984) unpacked the concept of interpretation further in their model of stress appraisal. This is based on two successful processes: primary appraisal and secondary Principles of stress: models, physiology and measurement 17 appraisal. Primary appraisal involves assessing the relevance of a situation and if relevant to the individual it may be appraised as benign or stressful. When a situation is regarded as stressful, the stress can be considered as a challenge, threat or harm/loss ( Lazarus, 1993 ). Secondary appraisal involves assessing what coping possibilities the individual possesses or believes to possess. For Lazarus and Folkman (1984) coping implied to constantly change efforts, cognitive and behavioral, to manage specific external and/or internal demands that are appraised as strenuous or exceeding the resources of the individual. The model was further developed to distinguish between emotion -focused and problem -focused coping. Additional- ly, the reappraisal process was introduced which is ongoing and involves continually reap- praising both the nature of the stressor as well as the resources available for responding to it. 2.1.4 Homeostasis plus: The concept of allostasis (Sterling & Eyer, McEwen ) The principle of homeostasis is fundamental and a basic principle to all stress concepts mentioned. The term coined by Cannon (1932) describes how the internal environment is regulated by an organism to equilibrate internal and external demands and therefore ensuring stable conditions. While homeostasis suggests narrow ranges of activity for internal biological parameters, this is true for physiological parameters such as blood oxygen or pH but not for many others (McEwen, 1998). The homeostasis concept has been modified b y Sterling and Eyer (1988) and was later extended by McEwen (1998 , 2005, 2016 ) to a framework that enhanced the neurobiological understanding of stress. While the original conception of homeostasis grounded in a) the assumption that there is an optimum sta te to any given measure in the body and b) that the ideal set point is reached by a local regulatory mechanism. The concept of allostasis augmented this view. Regarding the first point it seems evident that what is ideal under basal conditions may be diffe rent than what is \"ideal\" during stress and regarding the second point it seems apparent that set points may be regulated not only by one mechanism but by a myriad ( McVicar et al., 2013; Sapolsky, 2004). Systems such as the HPA axis, the autonomic nervous system, the metabolic systems and the immune system respond to the body state as well as the external environment and are concerned with achieving \"stability through change\" - this is called allostasis and was first termed by Sterling and Eyer (1988) Principles of stress: models, physiology and measurement 18 when they explored how the cardiovascular system adjusts to resting and active states. It is the process of the aforementioned systems to protect and adapt the individual to adversity and threats (real or implied) that is referred to as allostasis and is an ess ential component of maintaining homeostasis. The idea was then applied to other physiological mediators, such as the secretion of cortisol as well as catecholamines (McEwen, 1998). However, allostasis is not simply about the brain coordinating physiologica l reactions but one that is closely coupled to the psychological makeup of the individual and therefore may include changes in behavior as well. Another difference to homeostasis is that the setpoints of the systems may change over time. This adaptation ma y cause problems and is then termed as allostatic (over)load. The concept was proposed to refer to the wear and tear on the body and brain resulting from chronic overactivity or inactivity of physiological systems that are normally involved in adaptation t o environmental challenge. It is the repeated cycles of allostasis as well as the inefficient turning -on or shutting off of these responses that may result in allostatic load. Hence, McEwen and colleagues distinguish between short -term adaptive actions (al lostasis), which can be protective, and long -term effects (allostatic load), which can induce damage to an individual ( McEwen et al., 2015 a). The concept of allostasis and allostatic load is proposed as a concept of a cascade of cause and effect that begin s with primary stress mediators (cortisol and catecholamines) and leads to primary effects and then to secondary (the summa- rized outcome of the primary effects, i.e. sustained elevation of glucose as a result of elevated cortisol levels) and tertiary outco mes in the form of diseases and disturbances. Principles of stress: models, physiology and measurement 19 Figure 4: The model of allostatic load (McEwen, 1998) The model offers the possibility to integrate psychological, behavioral, genetic as well as (molecular) biological factors to explain short - and long -term effects of \"stress\". It consists of four key features: 1) The brain is the integrative center for the coordination of behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to challenges, 2) there are individual differences in coping with challenges based on individ ual genetic, developmental and experiential differences, 3) Within the individual lies the capacity to adapt (turning on and shutting off physiological responses efficiently) and 4) Allostasis has a price that is related to how inefficient the response is, or how many challenges an individual experiences. Various factors contribute to allostatic load such as genetic predisposition, early development as well as learned behaviors reflecting life style choices (i.e. exercise, diet, drinking and smoking) (S eema n et al., 1997; McEwen , 2016 ). Allostatic load may be subdivided into four subtypes: Principles of stress: models, physiology and measurement 20 Figure 5: The four types of allostatic load (McEwen, 1998) The first type of allostatic load is simply \"too much stress\" in the form of repeated events that lead to rep eated elevations of stress mediators over long periods of time. The second type involves a failure of adaptation to an identical stressor, while the third type is a failure of shutting off either the hormonal stress response or to display the normal trough of the diurnal Principles of stress: models, physiology and measurement 21 cortisol pattern. The last type of allostatic load involves an inadequate hormonal stress response which allows other systems to become overactive (i.e. the inflammatory cytokines) (McEwen, 1998). As adaptation to potentially stressful ch allenges involve activation of neural, neuroendocrine and neuroendocrine -immune mechanisms the focus shall now be on the physiology of the stress system with a focus on the hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal axis (HPA axis) even though the sympatho -adrenal med ullary (SAM) system also has its role in the process. 2.2 Physiology of the stress reaction The central organ of stress as well as adaptation to social and physical stressors is the brain. It determines what is threatening, stores memories, and regulates the physiological and behav- ioral responses to stressors (McEwen et al., 2015 a). However, s tress involves both the brain and body as well as their interaction. In the evolution mammalian organisms, including human beings, have developed a complex and highly ef ficient and flexible system whose main function it is to maintain homeostasis in both the resting as challenging states (Chrousos & Gold, 2006; McVicar, 2013 ). It is a complex interaction of the central nervous system (CNS), the autonomic nervous system (A NS) as well as the e ndocrine system. Therefore, the central stress system sits in a pivotal location on the base of the brain. According to Stratakis and Chrousos (2006) the key central coordinators of the stress system are the parvocellular corticotropin -releasing nuclei (PVN) of the hypothalamus, along with the CRH neurons of the paragigantocellular and other nuclei of the medulla, and the catecholaminergic neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC) and other cell groups of the medulla and the pons. Constantly being challenged by intrinsic and extrinsic forces to maintain a dynamic equilibrium the stress system receives input from multiple sources, integrating them, and itself providing input to multiple sites of both the CNS and the periph- ery. Inputs arise from the sensory organs, viscera, blood vessels, musculature, and other sites through the cranial and peripheral nerves, sensory afferen t fibers, and afferent autonomic Principles of stress: models, physiology and measurement 22 nerves as well as via the blood stream. Additionally they come from the brain cortex, via the associative cortex, the amygdala, and the hippocampus, and from the or reward system (Chrousos & Gold, 2006; Mc Ewen, 2012). Output of the stress system goes not only to the key players in the physiological stress response, the HPA axis and the SAM system, but also other target sites such as the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the spinal cord, the brain cort ex, the amygdala and hippocampus, and from the emotional brain through the mesocorticolimbic system (Ehlert et al., 2013 ; Koolhaas et al., 2011). Chrousos and Gold (2006) summarize this simplistically in the following manner: The stress system receives in formation from the environment and the body through the various sensory systems and the bloodstream, from the thinking brain through the amygdala and hippocampus, and from the emotional brain through the mesocorticolimbic system. (Chrousos & Gold, 2006) Under conditions of stress mostly both peripheral limbs of the stress system, the HPA axis and the SAM system, are being activated. While the SAM system reacts via neuronal activa- tion within seconds to a threat, the HPA axis is activated within minutes in a second wave (McEwen et al., 2015 a; Sapolsky et al., 2000). Principl es of stress: models, physiology and measurement 23 Figure 6: The SAM and HPA axis (Comer et al., 2015) Due to the fact that we measured and evaluated primarily cortisol levels (a parameter of the HPA axis) in our empirical study the main fo cus will be on the HPA axis. However, for the principle of completeness the SAM system is subsequently presented in brief. 2.2.1 The fast mode: sympatho -adrenal -medulla system (SAM) Research on the SAM roots back to the works of Cannon (1929) who taught that sti muli (environmental or internal) that threaten homeostasis concurrently activate the adrenal gland Principles of stress: models, physiology and measurement 24 to release epinephrine (EPI, synonymous adrenaline) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) which is part of the ANS. For Cannon and colleagues the two effe ctors were function- ing as a unit and came to be termed \"sympatho -adrenal\", \"sympathico -adrenal\" or \"sympatho - adreno -medullary\" system (Goldstein & Kopin, 20 07). The SAM system is one of the major pathways mediating physiological responses in different orga ns and tissues in the body. It provides a rapidly responding mechanism that controls most of the acute response of the individual to a stressor ( Melmed et al., 2015 ; Stratakis & Chrousos, 2006). The hypothalamus, in particular the PVN, controls both the SA M and the HPA axis response systems. The PVN synthesizes corticotrophin -releasing hormone CRH and AVP, and secretes via the median eminence into the hypophyseal portal blood ( Gore, 2013 ). The hypothalamus controls the SAM system by stimulating neurons conn ected to the adrenal medulla and the pons. These in turn activate the ANS producing the \"fight or flight\" response which stimulates the SNS while inhibiting the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) (Tsigos & Chrousos, 2002). One approach of the SAM system to regulates the body's stress response is by stimulating the cardiovascular system. To ensure sufficient oxygen and energy in the brain as well as in the skeletal muscles for the \"fight or flight\" response, the heart rate is increased and the blood vessel s are constricted in diameter. Interindividual differences in the stress response occur depending on former experience of the individual as well as the interpretation of the situation (Melmed et al., 2015 ). 2.2.2 The slow mode: hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal ax is The other peripheral limb of the stress system which is working cooperatively with the SAM system is the hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal (HPA) axis. Its key role in maintaining homeo- stasis is long known and the HPA axis bas been the subject of intense a nd longstanding scientific research. Principles of stress: mo dels, physiology and measurement 25 2.2.2.1 Functioning and hormones of the HPA axis The HPA axis is a regulatory system that intricately interconnects the CNS with the periphery via hormonal signaling and involves communication between the hypothalamus, the an terior pituitary PVN, pituitary (glandula suprarenales) and the adrenal glands which lie on top of the kidneys and compose of the adrenal medulla and the adren al the smaller inner adrenal medulla synthesiz es EPI and NE and is involved in the SAM system, the larger and outer adrenal cortex synthesiz es corticosteroids: (GC). The adrenal corte of three outer zona glomeru- losa, the middle zona fasciculata and and is composed of steroido- genic cells. GC such as cortisol are synthesized in the middle zona fasciculata, while MC such as aldosterone are synthesized reticularis synthesizes the androgen dehydroepiandrosterone which, among other is a precursor to testosterone and oestrogen. While GC exhibit a multitude of functions affecting metabolism, immune function, and the central nervous system, MC's such as aldosterone maintain normal blood volume, promote water and sodium retention and increase urinary excretion of potassium. The corticosteroids cortisol, aldosterone and DHEA, sy in the adrenal cortex. Both cortisol and DHEA are major stress hormones with effective responses to the stress stimuli in many body tissues including the brain ( Lennartsson et al., 2012 ). Therefore, the hormones of the HPA axis are primarily CRH, ACTH and Cortisol. CRH is a 41 amino acid expressed in the hypothalamus ( Gore, 2013 ). CRH neurons project to the external layer of the median eminence, where peptides are secreted into the portal blood- stream through which they ar e transported to the anterior pituitary. In addition to CRH, CRH neurons express and release AVP, although most AVP is express in neighboring magnocellu- lare elements of the PVN. CRH and AVP show a positive reciprocal interaction, with CRH being the princip al hypothalamic regulator and AVP having potent synergistic 2004). CRH and AVP travel through the infundibulum to the anterior Principles of stress: models, physiology and measurement 26 pituitary, where pro opiomelanocortin (POMC) is synthesized and decompose it into ACTH and beta -endorphins (Dedovic et al., 2009). The ACTH in turn stimu- lates the adrenal cortex, resulting in the synthesis of glucocorticoids, mainly cortisol in humans, in the zona fasciculate of the adrenal cortex ( Molina, 2006 ). Due to the importance of cortisol for this project cortisol will be focused on in greater detail in chapter 3.2.4. Figure 6: Major components of the HPA axis (Stephens & Wand, 2012) 2.2.2.2 Activation and regulation of the HPA axis The HPA axis is not simply an alarm system activated by potentially harmful or excessively demanding stimuli, but has two distinct modes of action. Firstly, under unstimulated basal Principles of stress: models, physiology and measurement 27 conditions it follows a diurnal r elease pattern, with peak level s of glucocorticoids linked to the start of the activity phase upon awakening. Throughout the day the levels decline and are mostly lowest at the end of the activity phase, after which levels begin to rise anew ( Gore, 2013 ). It is assumed that t he release of glucocorticoids is under control of an endogenous biological timekeeper, the circadian clock, t hat acts to prepare the organism for daily chal- lenges (Dickmeis, 2009) . Circadian control of glucocorticoid production as well as secretion involve a central pacemaker in the hypothalamus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, as well as a circadian clock in the adrenal gland itself. Therefore, the HPA axis and the ANS mediate this central circadian regulation , while the adrenal gland cloc k appears to control sensitivity of the gland to the ACTH (Dickmeis, 2009). Concentrations of ACTH show similar, but less pronounced, fluctuations ( Gore, 2013 ). Secondly, while basal activity of the HPA axis oscillates, the system is activated under emerge ncy conditions through neuronal input. A prototypical neuroendocrine response to an acute psychosocial stressor involves various hormones in a most consistent manner (Sapolsky et al. , 2000). After sensory information has been evaluated in the limbic system (hippocampus and amygdala ) and been appraised as a threat catecholamines are released from the sympathetic system, and neurons in the PVN of the hypothalamus release CRH and AVP into the hypophysial portal blood. Then, in a second step both hormones stimu late the anterior pituitary gland to produce and secrete ACTH into the general circulation. ACTH in turn induces glucocorticoid synthesis and release from the adrenal glands. The hormones of the first wave exert most of their effect on target tissues withi n a few minutes, while the majority of GC effects are not exerted until about an hour after the beginning of the stressor. When cortisol levels reach a certain level, CRH and ACTH release diminis hes ( Stephens & Wan d, 2012 ). To protect against an exaggerat ed HPA stress response which could have deleterious effects to the individual the HPA system is carefully modulated through several negative feedb ack loops ( Stephens & Wand, 2012 ). There is a \"short\" feedback from the pituitary to the PVN of the hypothalam us (ACTH signaling back inhibiting further release of ACTH) as well as to the PVN (cortisol inhibiting further release of CRH) and two from the adrenal cortex to the pituitary (cortisol inhibiting further release of ACTH) as well as to the PVN (cortisol inhibiting further release of CRH) ( McEwen et al., 2015 a). It is obvious that this is a Principles of stress: models, physiology and measurement 28 simplification of the complexity with numerous further affecting factors (i.e. signaling from the limbic system or the influence of th e SAM system in the adrenals) (Melmed et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, the prefrontal cortex (PFC ) (Kern et al., 2008) and the hippocampus with its various connections to the hypothalamus have inhibitory effects on CRH neurons in the PVN (Buchanan et al., 2009 ). 2.2.2.3 Modulating variab les of the HPA axis Different variables have been identified that may influence basal as well as stress associated HPA axis activity. Firstly, the forementioned circadian rhythm of the HPA axis which is explained by a direct connection between PVN and nucl eus suprachiasmaticus is to be mentioned maybe the most obvious modulating variable. While a clear circadian periodicity could be found for the HPA axis related hormones (CRH, ACTH and cortisol) this differs in clinical populations - for example for patien ts with stress -related disord Frodl & O'Keane, 2013 ). Especially well explored are the increased cortisol levels in patients with major depression (de Kloet et al., 2005). Furthermore, there is very strong evidence that the HPA axi s is strongly activated in situations of psychosocial stress with elevated cortisol levels increased after stress (Kudielka et al. , 2003). Kirschbaum and Hellhammer (1999) as well as Kudielka et al. (2009) reported other modulating factors such as gender, age, consumption of nicotine, the phase of the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, exces- sive sport, genetic disposition, intake of exogenous hormones (e.g. oral contraceptives), endogenous hormones (e.g. sex steroids) as well as others that may interfere. 2.2.2.4 Cortis ol: A marker for HPA axis activity Cortisol is a key player in the HPA axis stress response and a lipophilic glucocorticoid . Cortisol peaks in the morning and decreases over the day. It has a pulsatile secretion with about 7 -15 surges per day and as with a ll corticoids cortisol is synthesized from the precursor cholesterol via specific enzymatic systems. The synthesis is induced by the activation of the HPA axis (see 3.2.2.1) and it constitutes for 95% of all glucocorticoids in humans (Kallen, Principles of stress: models, physiology and measurement 29 2004). As cor tisol is a steroid and lipophilic most of it binds to transport proteins in the bloodstream after release from the adrenal cortex. Approximately two thirds of the released cortisol in healthy adults binds mostly via high -affinity receptors to the corticost eroid -bindi ng globulin (CBG) (Molina, 2006 ). Around 15 to 20 per cent bind via low -affinity receptors to albumin, while another 5 per cent binds to erythrocytes and only around 0.1% to testerone - binding globulin. Therefore, only 5 to 10 percent of unbound, free cortisol circulates and can be considered as biologically active ( Melmed et al., 2015 ). The cortisol binding proteins act as a pool, releasing unbound cortisol into the plasma as soon as the free cortisol concentration decreases. Due to its lipophili c nature, unbound cortisol may diffuse easily through cell membranes and distribute widely throughout the body. Cortisol transfers passively into saliva as a filtrate from the blood and is able to travel across the blood -brain barrier. Therefore it is found in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and may reach the amygdala, hippocampus, hypothal- amus, and anterior pituitary (Molina, 2006). The unbound fraction of cortisol may be assessed in urine, blood as well as saliva. Urinary -free cortisol (UFC) is often asse ssed over a 24 -hr period and is thought to reflect the amount of cortisol released by the adrenals that is released over a complete circadian cycle (Yehuda et al., 2003). Collection of cortisol from the plasma requires only minor invasive blood collection, while the collection of cortisol from the saliva is completely non -invasive by simply chewing on a cotton swab (e.g. Salivette\u00a9). Fortunately, measurements in the blood and saliva correlate highly ( Hellhammer et al., 2009 ). Yehuda et al. (2003) have point ed out that advantages of saliva assessment lie in the non -invasiveness, the convenience of the procedure for the participants as well as that the collection can be done at frequent intervals and does not require medical personal or special storage. These may be the reasons that it has become the \"gold standard\" to exploring stress reactivity and is also ideal for naturalistic studies . In both measurement s, saliva as well as blood, cortisol levels are analyzed with radioimmunoassay. The role of glucocortic oids lies in numerous processes of the metabolism as well as in the interaction with the immune system, the circulation and regulation of electrolytes (Ehlert, 2003). Specifically, GC influence the lipometabolism, carbohydrate as well as the protein metabo lism all of which are of eminent importance for managing stressful situations. In particular is cortisol responsible for glucogenesis in the liver and therefore the allocation of Principles of stress: models, physiology and measurement 30 energy in the stress reaction. In the brain they exert a broad range of molec ular, structural and functional effects through MC and GC receptors (de Kloet et al., 2008). GC can also exert immediate effects of the activation of receptors as well as long -lasting programming effects on brain function and behavior (de Kloet et al., 200 8, Sandi & Haller, 2015). The stress response with the resultant activation of the HPA axis is meant to be acute or at least of a limited duration and w hile increases in cortisol can be essential for short term survival, prolonged exposure can lead to se rious metabolic, immune and psychological dysfunction (McEwen , 2016 ; McVicar et al., 2013 ). While the activation of the stress re- sponse leads to anti -reproductive, antigrowth, catabolic and immunosuppressive effects such are, if time -limited, rather benefi cial than damaging. However, chronic dysregulations of glucocorticoid levels may lead to the syndromal state that Selye described in 1936. The prototypic example of chronic hyperactivation of the stress system is manifested in depression with dysphoric hy perarousal and relative immunosuppression ( McVicar & Clancy, 2011 ). In addition a spectrum of other conditions may be associated with increased and prolonged activation of the HPA axis. These may include cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune disorder, drug u se or a nxiety disorders ( Ehlert et al. , 2013). Very intense dysregulations of glucocorti- coid levels may also lead to hypo - or hypercortisolism. In case of an atrophy or hypertrophy of the adrenal cortex it's functioning may be effected. Addison's disease i s a primary adrenal insufficiency which is characterized by a strongly reduced secretion of hormones and conse- quently a deficiency of cortisol. By contrast Cushing's syndrome may be a result of hypercor- tisolism. It induces hypertension, heightened blood gl ucose levels, adiposity, depression or cognitive disturbances (de Kloet et al., 2005 ; Zhang et al., 2012 ). Already early investigations indicated that psychosocial stress activates the HPA axis (Mason, 1968). With the onset of a psychosocial stressor, th e HPA axis is activated and cortisol increases may be measured. On average cortisol peaks after around 15 to 20 minutes after the onset of stress. Around 60 to 90 minutes after the stress reaction hormone concentrations are back on their baseline level (Di ckerson & Kemeny, 2004). Unlike the SAM system which has an instant and relatively short lived effect, the HPA axis takes longer and the effects last longer. The HPA response is often comparable, but t here are individual differences in the Principles of stress: models, physiology and measurement 31 threshold for HP A activation which have been suggested as being due to a person's predispo- sition (Jones & Bright, 2001) . However, t he HPA axis has proven to be a valid system for research on the stress response. Making stress tangible: measuring indicators of stress 32 3 Making stress tangible: measuring indicators of stress It has been shown that stress is a complex phenomenon and that the popular ideas regarding the underlying mechanism not always coincide with the biological reality. Understanding the fundamental concept is an important cornerstone of the field, but it is equa lly important to being able to measure indicators of the stress response both on a psychological as well as on a biological level. This knowledge may help deepen the understanding of the subject as well as testing different intervention methods, not only f or themselves, but in the future maybe also in different populations in order to find the population -centered most effective coping method. 3.1 Levels of stress reaction It has been shown that the stress reaction may be seen as a holistic response of an indiv idual, where the psychological aspects are inseparably intertwined with the physiological processes. This is the case for all humans, but there are interindividual differences on what level the stress response is being activated. While some may react with their cardiovascular system, others may show muscle tenseness or changes in the digestive system. Kaluza (2004) argues that this individual reaction -specifity may be the result of the interaction of hereditary factors with biographic experiences. An exampl e may be a genetic disposition to cardiovascular hyperreactivity in combination with a certain coping strategy that may lead to overactivation of the cardiovascular system in challenging situations (Kaluza, 2004). The stress reaction may evoke a response o n one or several of the four levels: Table 2: Level of stress reaction (Kaluza, 2007) Level of stress reaction Examples Cognitive emotional level Thoughts and feelings that may be triggered in a situation. (e.g. feelings of agitation, anxiety, anger, g uilt feelings or thought pondering) Making stress tangible: measuring indicators of stress 33 Behavioral level Perceivable behavior that is shown by the individual under the impact of stress (e.g. doing activities hastily, substance abuse, bodily restlessness, petulant interaction with social environment) Vegetative -hormonal level Reactions of the ANS and the related physiological systems (e.g. cardiovas- cular symptoms, immune deficiency, menstrual cycle dysregulations) Muscular level Reactions in the realm of the skeletal muscles (trembling, bruxism, backache or tension headache) Oftentimes these reactions are reinforcing each other leading to amplification of the stress reaction. However, this reciprocal influence may also be utilized to favorably influence the reaction and therefore attenuate it. For Kaluza (2004) it helps individuals in coping if they have knowledge towards what reaction pattern they are prone to under stress. 3.2 Stressors In the preceding chapters it has been argued that there is an inextricab e entangled relationship between the stimulus in the environment and the individual's interpretation of it . Following a popular expression, it might be said that \"stress lies in the eye and appraising of the behold- er\". Consequently, there are a myriad of possibilities of stimuli that may potentially be experienced as stressors. Yet, there are situations and events that lead with a high probability to a stress response within a large part of the population. Already Mason (1968) suggested that situations that are perceived as particularly intens e are: a) meaningful, b) novel, c) unpredictable and d) uncontrollable to the individual. However, as it is an individual appraisal process there is no set definition o r categorization of stressors. Nevertheless a distinction between psychological and phys ical stressors that are either acute (minutes to hours) or chroni c (days to months) seems reasonable . And furthermore, for scientific purposes stress Making stress tangible: measuring indicators of stress 34 may also be categorized in either natural stressors or experimentally induced stressors (Ehlert et al., 20 13). 3.2.1 Acute physical stressors A wide variety of acute physical stressors have been used in stress response studies in humans. For the sake of completeness a variety of such physical stress tests are reported. They range from resistance and aerobic exercis e to cold pressure and sauna exposure. They are described in Table 3. Table 3: Acute laboratory physical stressors Stressor Description Resistance exercise A resistance exercise task involving 4 sets of 10 resistance maximum of four different exercises (back squat, bench press, bent over row, and shoulder press). Rest between each sets (Kraemer & Ratamess , 2005). Aerobic exercise An 8 -minute sub -maximal exercise test on a cycle ergometer. Participants cycle at workloads of 60 up to 180 workloads (Rin g et al., 2005). Cold pressor Immersion of one hand in 0 - 40C water for 60 seconds (Bullinger et al., 1984; Duncko et al., 2009). Immersion of one hand in 0 -40C for a maximum of 3 minutes (Schwabe et al., 2008). The immersion of one hand in 1 00C water for 4 minutes exact followed by the immersion of the other hand for 4 minutes exact (Ring et al., 2000). Cool room exposure 40 minutes in a cold room at 100C (Chatterton et al., 1996). Sauna exposure 40 minutes in a sauna at 660 C (Chatt erton et al., 1996). Making stress tangible: measuring indicators of stress 35 Concurrent with the research objectives of evaluating methods for psychosocial stress the focus will shift to acute psychological stressors and how effects may be monitored. 3.2.2 Acute psychological stressors Acute psychological stresso rs have been used in natural as well as experimental settings. Natural settings may be school examinations, daily hassles or important personal events such as marriage, birth of a child or in very burdensome situations traumatization (e.g. sexual abuse, ac cident in a vehicle) (Ehlert et al., 2013). An advantage of experimental settings is the possibility of standardization and therefore ensuring that the situation for each individual is as similar as possible. As the study follows the research protocol of G aab et al. (2003) the reported study takes place in an experimental setting and the focus shall be on this group. A wide variety of standardized stress have been used and include mental arithmetic task, stroop color word conflict test, stressful video game s, viewing of negative emotional pictures or the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). In table 4 they are presented in overview. Table 4: Acute laboratory psychological stressors Stressor Description Mental arithmetic task A four minute task of mental ar ithmetic performed according to a strict set of rules (Fredrickson et al., 1991). Stroop Test Creating mental processing conflicts in which the words of the colors (blue, red, yellow, and green) are printed in incongruent colors. The task is to ignore the meaning of the word and name the color of the print (Fredrickson et al., 1991; Stroop, 1935). Stressful video game Computer game where the game objective is to kill as many enemy characters as possible. The game layout took on a first person persp ective (\"shooter perspective\") which provided a level of virtual realism (Skosnik et. al, 2000). Viewing of negative emotional pictures A set of pictures derived from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Pictures are divided in four cate gories, depicting neutral items to extremely negative emotional images. Then participants rate the emotionality of the picture (van Stegeren et al., 2006). Making stress tangible: measuring indicators of stress 36 Viewing of a harsh video Participants are watching a video showing bloody dental procedures, suc h as the extraction of front teeth and removal of a molar with a pick ( Bosch et al., 2003 ). Trier Social Stress Test A psychosocial stress test in which the participants performs a speech and then a mental arithmetic task in front of panel (Kirschbaum et al., 1993). Psychological stress is capable of activating the sympatho -adrenal -medullary (SAM) system as well -adrenal (HPA) axis. A meta s tudies (Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004 ) found that the psychological stressor with the most substantial cortisol response is the Trier Social Stress Test (Kirschbaum et al., 1993) which involves a public speaking as well as an arithmetic task. Already during the preparation for the speech physiological measur es such as epinephrine, norepinephrine and cortisol increase in participants (Ehlert et al., 2013). The TSST incorporates elements of uncontrolla- bility and social evaluative threat which leads to a reliable activation of the stress system, which is accompa nied by psychological tension in participants (Campbell & Ehlert, 2012). Since its introduction in 1993 the TSST has become a popular laboratory stressor and may be seen as the \"gold -standard\" in the evaluation of psychosocial laboratory stress. 3.2.2.1 Physiologi cal changes in response to a stressor Summarizing the preliminary findings it may be concluded that the physiological response to a stressor may be evaluated in the SAM system as well as the HPA axis. In the former the stress respons is to change activatio n of the cardiovascular system. In particular an increase in heart rate is a common measurement in assessing the SNS stress response. However, activa- tion of the SNS may also result in increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure and are also common meas urements in assessing the impact of the SNS in the stress response. Another indicator is the salivary protein alpha -amylase which has shown to be sensitive to psychoso- cial stress tests and increase. Physiological changes in the parasympathetic nervous syst em have historically utilized urine or serum and more recently saliva. Physiological changes in the HPA axis in response to a stressor may be measured in saliva cortisol. Making stress tangible: measuring indicators of stress 37 3.2.2.2 Psychological changes in response to a stressor Aside the physiological changes that may be assessed, the subjective experience of stress may be measured with various psychometric instruments. They may focus on different periods of time and different areas of perception or behavior. Over the last century clinical psychological science has been very interested in disease processes (Ehlert, 2003). The focus lies on the negative aspect in a challenging situation and to what extent this is measurable. The following areas have been under scrutiny in research projects (Gaab et al., 2003; Nedeljk ovic et al., 2012; Storch et al., 2007) : Depressive symptom atology Depressive symptoms are among the most prevalent symptoms. In healthy populations questionnaires are utilized that assess f.e. depressive affect and negative thought patterns. Measured characteristics may include insecurity, hopelessness, exhaustion, self -devaluation, loneliness, sadness, anxiety or social withdrawal . An example is the Center for Epidemiologi- cal Studies Depression Scale by Radloff (1977), with the german version by Hautzin ger and Bailer ( 1993). Perceived level of s tress in life The perception of \"stress \" and which situations in life were perceived as stressful is a focal point of interest. Aspects may be to assess how predictable, uncontrollable, and overloading particip ants perceive their lives . A common instrument is the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) by Cohen and Williams (1988). Disposition to cope with stressors It also has been of interest on how individuals cope with stressors and specifically what disposition und erlies individual differences in physi ological and psychological stress respons- es. It has been assumed that perceived stress reactivity is relatively stable across situations, over time and response systems (Schlotz et al., 2011) . The individual's perceive d typical response intensity aggregated across different potentially stressful situations in everyday life has been operationalized in the Stress Reactivity Scale by Schulz et al. (2005). A question-Making stress tangible: me asuring indicators of stress 38 naire that is specifically recommended as a tool to evalua te this area in stress management programs. However, these aspects are only one part of the process. It is an accomplishment of An- tonovski who diametrically changed the approach and focused on what keeps individuals under adverse circumstances healthy (Eh lert, 2003). This may be considered as measuring aspects of resilience or as Antonovsky has put it \"sense of coherence\". Therefore, psychomet- ric measures of this realm should be part of measuring the process of challenging situations as well. Areas of inte rest have been (Gaab et al., 2003; Nedeljkovic et al., 2012; Storch et al., 2007) : Generalized resistance resources It has been proposed that individuals generally possess resistance resources that assist them in coping with a wide variety of life's chal lenges (Antonovsky, 1987; Kenne Sarenmalm et al., 2011) . Such resources may explain why some individuals cope successfully with even severe stressors and remain able to maintain psychological health whereas others do not. A concept has been shown to captur e such resistance resources has been termed sense of coherence (SOC). Antonovsky (1987) found that SOC is a resource that enables people to reflect upon their re sources (internal and external) and how they can mobilise them to find solutions and resolve te nsion (Eriksson & Lindstr\u00f6m, 2006). A common psychometric instrument to measure this concept is the SOC -L9 (Schumacher et al., 2000 ). Self efficacy and competence Self-efficacy is seen as a central predictor of intentions and behavior. Individual percepti ons of own competencies and power (i.e., self -efficacy) is connected to the actual capacity to act autonomously and efficiently (Greve et al., 2001). Perceived self -efficacy is the belief that a novel or difficult task may be successfully coped with. Perce ived self -efficacy may facilitate: goal setting, effort investment, persistence in face of barriers or recovery from setbacks (Schwarzer & Jerusalem, 1995). A scale that assesses a general sense of perceived self - efficacy is the Self Efficacy Scale (German : Selbstwirksamkeitserwartung, SWE). by Schwarzer and Jerusalem (1995) . Furthermore, t he development of personal action compe-Making stress tangible: measuring indicators of stress 39 tence is seen as an important prerequisite to succeed in social life and is central to a person's self-regulation of the own devel opment (Brandst\u00e4dter, 1998). It may be evaluated by utilizing the Questionnaire for Competence and Control Orientations ( German: Fragebogen zur Kontroll\u00fcberzeugung und Kompetenzerwartung (FKK to measure stress scientifically on different leve ls and gain better insight into the process as well as being able to compare results with other research groups is a current objective of scientific projects. Stress Management 40 4 Stress Management The negative impact of stress often has encumbering effects on an individual level but also leads on a macrolevel to substantial economic al consequences. The symptoms and disorders associated with it that are found on the microlevel have in detail been discussed in the introduction . However, the suffering of the individual and his environment is never fully quantifiable. The economic perspective has been subject to research in the past. For Switzer- land, the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) found in a 2010 study that 34% of the swiss working population felt \"often to very often\" stressed (Grebner et al., 2011). Compared to a previous study by the SECO ten years earlier (Ramaciotti & Perriard, 200 3) this number increased by approx. one third during this time. Meanwhile the amount of people that felt \"never or sometim es\" stressed diminished in the same period (Grebner et al., 2011). Assessing the economic impact of stress is complex as the detrimental effects of stress have impact on many levels. Impaired physical and mental functioning, work days lost, increased impai rment at work are just a few effects stress may have. The most recent study regarding the economic impact of stress is from Ramaciotti and Perriard (2003) and estimates the cost of direct (medical costs, self -medication and absenteeism) and indirect (work related acci- dents and occupational diseases) costs at approx imately 8 billion CHF or 2.3% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Therefore, the urge to find solutions that enable the management of stress and lead healthier lives has been enforced from indi viduals, organizations as well as governments. This has led to a plethora of methods claiming to counteract the negative dynamic process of stress. Such interventions have been developed over the last 40 years to ameliorate the negative effect of stress (E sch et al., 2007). Approaches that help to relief and cope with stress have been termed and characterized as stress management techniques. Stress management approaches consist of various elements that are usually applied in combination with each other. Stress Management 41 4.1 Intervention types of stress management The general goal of stress management interventions lies in fostering psychological as well as physical health by improving the individual competences of coping with stress. According to Kaluza (2014) i t should not be about teaching a standard strategy for a specific stressful situation but to develop strategies built on a variety of approaches that lead to flexibility in coping with daily hassles. The author proposes three approaches to be specifically helpful in a stress management program: a) instrumental stress management, b) mental stress management and c) palliative -regenerative stress management. Table 5: Strategies of individual stress management (Kaluza, 2014) Stressmanagement Approach Examples Instrumental Reduce or eliminate sources of stress Reactive towards existing strains Proactive planning of favorable circumstances and settings Reorganization of working space Change of working procedures Use of time management tools Setting of personal and busines s goals Mental Reduce malign and stress amplify- ing personal attitudes and thought patterns Build helpful and advantageous appraisal processes and thought patterns Make conscious and critically reflect detrimental thought patterns and transformation i nto beneficial thought patterns and attitudes Critically reflect perfectionist perfor- mance demands and learn to accept personal boundaries Perceive difficulties not as threat but as a challenge Identify less with daily tasks and keep more inner distance Become aware of the positive, pleasant and feel thankfulness Palliative -regenerative Address the physical and psycho- logical stress reaction to ease physical tension, inner restlessness and nervousness Build inner strength and resilience to cope with p otential stressors Learn a relaxation technique and regular use of it Develop physical exercise routines Learn to enjoy the small things in daily life Maintain a work -life balance by pursuing leisure activities Use sufficient sleep as a regenerative source Stress Management 42 There are various methods to categorize the different approaches of stress management methods. Van der Klink et al. (2001) distinguished four intervention types: cognitive - behavioral approaches, relaxation techniques, multimodal interventions, and organization - focused interventions. While cognitive -behavioral approaches aim at changing cognitions and amplifying existing and new coping skills, relaxation techniques focus on physical or mental relaxation as the method of coping with stress. Multimodal interventions emphasize the acquisition of both passive and active coping skills, while the last intervention type involves a focus on the organization as such. For Esch et al. (2007) the constituents of professional stress management strategies typically consist of nutrition, exercise, behavior (cognitive behavioral interventions, positive psychology) and relaxation (f.e. autogenic training, progressive muscle relaxation) or mild meditative movements (f.e. Yoga or Qi Gong exercises). A more elaborat- ed seg mentation of stress management methods has been utilized by Lehrer et al. (2007): a) Muscle relaxation (f.e. progressive muscle relaxation), b) Hypnotic methods (Hypnosis, autogenic training method), c) Biofeedback (Neurofeedback, biofeedback training to i ncrease heart rate variability), d) Breathing retraining and exercise, e) Methods based on eastern meditative and therapeutic disciplines (Mindfulness meditation, Qigong, Yoga, Tai Chi), f) Cognitive methods (Cognitive approaches, stres s inoculation traini ng) and g) o ther methods (Music therapy, eye movement desentization and reprocessing). Summarizing , it may be stated that as stress is a complex multifactorial process there are various strateg ies that might prove to be helpful to successfully manage it (Folkman, 2013; Regehr et al., 2013) . However, to be effective and efficient in its purpose a professional stress management intervention relies on scientific evidence and continuously develops through implementation of the results found in rigorous examina tion of it. While in the early 20th century the opinion of an authority was the important criteria to decide whether an interven- tion was improving the condition this relying on clinical experience, clinical instinct and intuition are not sufficient any mor e. Unsystematic observations may deliver cues as to where to research more, but are not the method of choice to evaluate the efficiency and efficacy of an intervention. There are several limitations to this procedure such as \"post hoc non est propter hoc\", meaning \"after is not because of\" or cognitive biases on both professional (f.e. Stress Management 43 \"Positivity bias towards the treatment\") as well as patient side (\"Positivity or negativity bias towards the results\") that may confound such observations. The gold standard to assess effectiveness and efficiency of interventions today are randomized controlled trials (RCT). RCT's are not perfect per se and strengths as well as weaknesses give sometimes rise to discussions regarding the validity of the presented results. And w hile the biologist Jakob Johann Baron von Uexk\u00fcll might have been right with his, at least to him attributed quote, that \"the science of today is the error of tomorrow\" RCT's are still the relevant standard to answer the aforementioned question. Cognitive behavioral stress management interventions are among the best evaluated programs and have shown to fulfill RCT standards (f.e. Abelson et al., 2014). Methods based on eastern meditative and therapeutic disciplines have in the past years been used more fre quently. To some extent they have been evaluated, for example Yoga (Kiecolt -Glaser et al., 2010) or Tai Chi (Nedeljkovic et al., 2012), but for many methods there are no RCT's published yet. A method that is also based in the category of \"eastern disciplin es\" and is commonly used as well as recognized by the Swiss government as an accredited profession, is kinesiology. 4.2 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Stress Management In the development of psychology as a field many therapeutic forms with different under lying assumptions and treatment forms have developed. Unified by the core concern of maintaining mental health or the restoration of healthy functioning among the recent and most widely used intervention methods are those based on cognitive and cognitive b ehavioral strategies (Hof- mann et al., 2012). Historically the incorporation of cognition in behaviorally dominated clinical psychology era was a gradual shift rather than an abrupt change. The antecedents of cognitive therapy were the social learning theor y of Bandura (1969) and Mischel (1973) who suggested the importance of cognitive variables and placed these within the context of \"covert behavior\". This context allowed them access to \"legitimate\" scientific status (Ingram et al., 1991). According to Ingr am et al. (1991) the group among which the term cognitive - behavioral was used first, consisted of Beck (1976) and Ellis (1963) which came from Stress Management 44 traditions that were not originally behaviorist, as well as Kendall and Hollon (1979), Ma- honey (1974), Lazarus (1 981) and Meichenbaum (1977). Currently the cognitive behavioral approach consists of cognitive -behavioral therapies and interventions that share a core set of assumptions and characteristics. While there are such unifying elements that constitute the appro ach it is important to state that by no means it is a uniform or single approach of treatment. There are meaningful differences among specific cognitive -behavioral interven- tions (Ingram et al., 1991). The core characteristics of any treatment considered to be cogni- tive-behavioral are a) cognitive variables are assumed to be important causal mechanisms. There may be other meaningful causal mechanisms as well, but cognitive variables are important in the constellation of processes that elicit the onset and co urse of a disorder and b) following from the assumption that cognitive variables are presumed to be causal agents, at least some of the methods and techniques of the intervention are aimed specifically at cognitive targets (Ingram et al., 1991). Certainly, there are many more shared assumptions and features of cognitive -behavioral methods but the aforementioned are in some form always present. Butler at al. (2006) report over 325 published outcome studies on cognitive -behavioral interventions. CBT is adapt ed increasingly to a wider range of disorders and problems (Beck, 1997; Salkovskis, 1996). Exempli gratia are treatment for depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder with agoraphobia, social phobia, obsessive -compulsive disorder, posttraumat ic stress disorder, schizophrenia, anger, bulimia nervosa, childhood disorders, sexual offending or chronic pain (Butler et al., 2006 ; Hofmann et al., 2012 ). It is noteworthy, that according to Bodenmann and Gmelch (2009) stress is often prevalent in the e tiology of psychological disorders or acts as trigger that sets off an adverse development that may lead to it. Also, stress is an essential factor in the diathesis -stress model of psychological disorders. But as stress and its adverse consequences on heal th are such important topics, the quest for interventions and trainings that effectively attenuate stress has gained in importance in psychologically based health promotion (Benedict, 2013). Stress Management 45 4.2.1 Overview of cognitive behavioral stress management interventions Cognitive -behavioral stress management (CBSM) contains different approaches aimed at improving the ability to cope and prevent stress. It is geared to positively influence the psychological and physiological stress reaction. A large part of CBSM are based on the transactional stress model by Lazarus & Folkman (1984) and of cognitive therapy (Beck, 1976; Ellis, 1963 ; Meichenbaum, 1985). Many CBSM programs aim to enhance individual coping with stress, while their emphases are on a) imparting of a theoretical framework of stress, b) identifying and change of stress inducing cognitions, c) problem -solving training and d) elements of relaxation training. In short it could be stated that most programs focus on psychological as well as physiological aspects of the stress process (Riekert et al., 2013) . The CBSM interventions either facilitate approach -specific coping strategies or a combination of various multimodal techniques such as: cognitive restructuring techniques, relaxation, problem solving strategies, co ping skills rehearsal, meditation, biofeedback, anger manage- ment, breathing techniques, life style changes, self -assertion techniques, scrutinizing one's own values, social support utilization as well as other elements that may be applied. Lazarus and Folk man (1984) conceived stress management as a regulative process, which is triggered by the individual's appraisal of a situation as threatful. Events that initiate this coping may lie within the person (the individuals own overexaggerated demands or setting one's own goals that are too ambitious) or from the outside (demands from others or exorbitant goals from the environment) (Bodenmann & Gmelch, 2009). According to Lazarus and Folkman (1984) the appraisal may initiate a chain of activity and coping action s to manage a situation. Therefore, Lazarus and Folkman (1984) proposed that CBSM intervention programs should include an emotion -focused as well as a problem -focused approach. These are seen as the two main functions of stress management. Problem -focused coping is also known as assimilative and emotion -focused coping as accommodative. Stress Management 46 Table 6: Emotion -focused and problem -focused coping Description Examples Emotion -focused coping Regulate the emotions evoked by the stressful event . Distraction Emotional disclosure (f.e. express- ing emotions by talking or writing about those emotions) Mindfulness and relaxation Cognitive reappraisal Problem -focused coping Problem focused strategies aim to remove or reduce the cause of the stressor (Folkman & Lazarus, 1985) . Problem -solving Time management Obtaining instrumental social support (f.e. supervisor or mentor) Bodenmann and Gmelch (2009) see those functions not as each other excluding categories but rather such that are complementary to each other and in most cases, are emotion -focused as well as problem -focused strategies necessary to successfully master the challenge. In any case Meichenbaum ( 2007 ) suggests that individual and cultural differences should be considered. Further support for in dividualization of CBSM programs comes from Wortman and Silver (1989) who emphasized that individuals under stress show variability in coping strategies. Therefore, the flexibility of a client's behavioral repertory should be facilitated in the training and not a \"one fix for all\" standard strategy. A s early as 1984 Lazarus and Folkman empha- sized that the individual should learn to adapt his coping to a specific situation and conditions as well as goals. Generally the role of cognitive and affective factors in the development and coping of stress are analyzed in CBSM trainings . 4.2.1.1 Validated stress management trainings Numerous studies have demonstrated that CBSM can effectively influence psychological and physiological parameters and health status in patient populations as well as in healthy indi- viduals (Bodenmann & Gmelch, 2009). CBSM may strengthen existing and build new competences, change appraisal and coping styles, develop new behavior in actual situations, Stress Management 47 build a feeling of self -efficacy, psychological ly immunize an individual against stress and thereby enhance physiological and psychological well -being. While there are many different CBSM trainings marketed not all have empirically been evaluated and shown to be sufficient- ly efficacious. Established an d empirically validated general CBSM trainings in the German speaking area are the trainings in Table 7.

(2002) Psychoeducation for the topic stress, stress diminishing activities, avoidance of unnecessary stress, dealing with acute stress, health life style 1 day (6h) According t o Bodenmann and Gmelch (2009) the stress prevention program by Meichenbaum (2003) is probably the most known scientifically substantiated CBSM intervention. It is also widely used in the German speaking area of Europe. 4.2.1.2 The Stress Inoculation Training (SI T) In this study an adapted version of the SIT by Meichenbaum (2007) was utilized. SIT is a flexible, individually tailored, multifaceted form of CBSM. The central concept underlying SIT is that of \"inoculation\". This has been used in biological medicine as well as in psycho- logical research on attitude change. In 1796 Edward Jenner noted that inoculation of humans with cowpox conferred immunity against the deadly smallpox virus. Vaccinations often involves exposure to weaker forms of a disease to ward off more severe reactions (Meichen- baum, 2007). The earlier exposure to a moderate form of the stress or disease shields the body by producing antibodies and physically prepares it for future attacks. This is consistent with the concept of hormesis that studies the positive results that derive from exposure to small amounts of toxins that in larger amount might be lethal (Aldwin and Levenson, 2004). SIT is based on the notion that exposing clients to milder forms of stress can bolster both coping mechanism and o ne's confidence in using the coping repertoire as well as developing a sense of mastery. Given the wide spectrum of stressors that individuals experience, SIT provides a set of general principles and clinical guidelines for treating distressed individuals, rather than a \"prescription\" formula for a specific situation. It is a semi structured and flexible program combining elements of teaching with classical cognitive behavioral techniques like the Socratic Dialogue, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, relaxation, behavioral and imaginary techniques, self -monitoring, self -instructions, self -reinforcement and environmen- tal strategies. SIT includes a repertory of problem - and emotion -focused coping strategies to Stress Management 49 deal with present and with future stressors (Meichenbaum, 2003) . The founder of SIT formulated the following general goals of the intervention: 1) inform the client about the transactional character of stress and coping with it, 2) train the client in the perception of dysfunctional thoughts, ima ges, emotions and behaviors in order to reappraise the stressor successfully, 3) to learn the client problem solving and coping strategies, 4) to sensitize the client to use maladaptive reaction as a cue to activate his coping repertory, 5) to conduct b ehavioral and imaginary exercise and gradual confrontation to reinforce the client's faith in his coping competence, and 6) to help the client gain suffi cient knowledge of effective co ping and improve his self-awareness and coping strategies when confront ed with (un)expected stress- ors The program consists of three phases: a conceptual educational phase , a skills acquisition and skills consolidation phase and a practice and follow -through phase . The first phase, also known as information or conceptualizat ion phase , is about building a therapeutic alliance with the client and informing about the underlying scientific stress concept. This relationship provides the groundwork that enables and encourages clients to confront stressors and implement the new lear ned coping skills, both within the training sessions as well as in behavioral in -vivo experiments (Meichenbaum, 2003). The second phase, the skills acquisi- tion and practice phase , clients are invited to learn and acquire new coping strategies. If clients a lready possess helpful stress management skills they are consolidated in this phase. An important focus of this phase is emphasized on guidelines to achieve generalization and maintenance of the treatment effects (Meichenbaum, 2007). The third phase, practice and follow -through phase , gives clients the opportunity to apply the new knowledge of coping skills stepwise to increasingly demanding levels of stressors . The phase contains imaginary and behavioral exercise, m odeling, role playing, and graded in vivo exposure. Clients explore with the trainer possible high -risk stressful situations and then rehearse and practice in a collaborative fashion with the trainer the coping techniques that might be helpful. Part of the Stress Management 50 follow -through and transfer phase is al so relapse prevention intervention. C lients learn how to view lapses, that might occur , as \"learning opportunities\" rather than as occasions to \"catastrophize\" and relapse. The follow -through features of SIT are designed to extend training into the future (Meichenbaum, 2003). However, the three phases are not meant to be distinct categories but rather overlap. Meichenbaum (2003) has reviewed numerous studies and showed that SIT is efficacious and efficient in various populations. SIT has been applied in therapy and health prevention with groups, couples or individuals and in clinical as well as non -clinical populations. In casu the SIT was group based, with 18 individuals attending the training sessions on two consecutive days for six hours. A trained the rapist and SIT expert led the workshop and instructed the participants. 4.2.2 Empirical evaluation In a systematic search of published data in PubMed a vast body of literature concerned with the evaluation of CBT as well as CBSM was found. However, when focusi ng on the empirical evaluation and specific effects of stress management interventions in healthy individuals relatively few studies exist. The accumulation of stress management studies across a wide variety of intervention areas, geographic settings, asse ssing a multitude of intervention tactics, calls for systematic reviews. Meta -analysis has become the widely -accepted technique for assessing the effectiveness of interventions (Richardson & Rothstein, 2008). 4.2.3 Results from meta -analyses on CBSM with healt hy individual s A systematic review of research revealed that only 11 meta -analyses address stress manage- ment interventions with healthy individuals (as located in the database Pubmed: Alzahem et al., 2014; Bamberg and Busch, 1996; Jones and Johnston, 2000; Joyce et al., 2016; Edwards et al., 2003; Kaluza, 2002; Miller and Cohen, 2001; Regehr et al., 2012 ; Richardson and Rothstein, 2008; Shiralkar et., 2013 and van der Klink et al., 2001). Summarizing the results Stress Management 51 of all meta -analyses it may be stated that CB SM with healthy individuals has consistently found to be effective in influencing psychological and physiological parameters as well as health outcomes in health and disease. Kaluza (2002) integrated 36 studies (n = 2133). 22 of the 36 studies were randomi zed-controlled trials, on average the participants were 36 years old (SD = 12.4) and the preferred intervention groups were students (8), employees in different fields (6), teachers (4) and hospital personnel (3). Mean training time was 13 hours, with a ra nge between 6 and 30 hours, while half of the studies were below 10 hours of training. The training period varied from one day to 28 weeks, with a mean of 7 weeks. In half of the studies examined the program consists of the three building blocks (informati on, relaxation and cognitive restructuring). The other studies add techniques such as time man- agement, communication, social support, problem solving and information regarding health behavior. Kaluza (2002) found positive evidence regarding the efficacy of the programs in different result categories. He found small (d = 20) to middle -sized (d = 50) effects with the relatively strongest effects shown in the improvement of psychological and physiological wellbeing. It is noteworthy that subjective stress perc eption and somatic complaints seemed to decrease only slightly. The sustainability of the intervention was evaluated with follow -up measurements and an increase of effect size from 0.54 (for the period < 6 months) to 0.82 for a prolonged period was found. However, only the measures on psychological well -being could be calculated for an observation period of longer than six months. Kaluza (2002) understood this as indication, that training effects do not fluctuate over time but seem to amplify. However, it n eeds to be noted that because many studies lacked a control group the validity of this conclusion is not certain. The effect sizes found correspond well with the evidence found in a meta -analysis by Bamberg and Busch (1996) on occupational CBSM. Interestin gly the less effective interventions proved to be the ones that were rather short seminar -style with emphasis primarily on conveying information. The most successful programs were longer and emphasized the transfer of the new acquired coping skills into everyday life. To evaluate the influence of training intensity on the effects, the effect sizes for the psychological well -being were calculated for short -term (below 10 hours of training) and long-term (more than 10 hours of training) interventions. Thereby , a difference in effect size of 24 points (d = 27 for short -term and d = 51 for long -term) could be observed. This might hint that the length of a program is an indicator of the trainings intensity and might be a Stress Management 52 relevant moderator of efficacy. In the met a-analyses Kaluza (2002) criticizes three shortcom- ings: 1) The methodological shortcoming of missing control groups leads to m issing data regarding the long -term efficacy of the interventions and this is a crucial part of the evalua- tion. 2) The success cri teria are skewed towards negative psychological feelings (f.e. anxiety, depressive mood, exhaustion or physical discomfort). Success is than reduced to the reduction of negative states and positive indicators of psychological and physical well -being are no t collected. 3) The primary objectives of stress management, the coping strategies utilized after the training are not being evaluated and are not part of the success criterias (Kaluza, 2002). Van der Klink et al. (2001) used meta -analytic techniques to e xamine the effectiveness of workplace stress management interventions. Forty -five Studies that were published between 1977 and 1996 were meta -analyzed. The authors found significant but small effect size (d = 0.34) and when analyzed CBSM interventions achi eved the larges effect size (d = 0.68). However, Richardson and Rothstein (2008) criticize that studies of varying study designs and methodological quality were included. Some did not include control groups while others used only quasi -experimental designs . It was concluded that in their meta -analyses only methodo- logically strong designs as well as new studies should be considered. Richardson and Roth- stein (2008) identified 38 articles (n = 2847) that met the inclusion criteria with sample sizes ranging fro m 14 to 219 participants and a mean of 49. Of the participants 59% were female and mean age was 35.4. Average intervention length was 7.4 weeks with the mean number of treatment session being 7.5, each lasting 1 - 2 hours. Meta -analysis yielded a significa nt effect size across all studies (d = 0.52) which by Cohen (1988) is considered as a medium to large effect size. Concurring with the meta -analyses of van der Klink et al. (2001) they found cognitive -behavioral interventions to yield the largest effect si zes (d = 1.16). Despite the stronger effects of CBSM the most popular treatment were relaxation and meditation tech- niques. The authors hypothesize that it might be the simplicity of the procedure that makes these interventions favored. The authors criticiz e that only a quarter of interventions of the studies assessed included follow -up measures subsequent to the posttreatment evaluation. Richardson and Rothstein (2008) encourage future research that more methodologically rigorous interventions studies with random assignment to treatment and control groups should be conducted. Another meta -analysis of Regehr e t al. (2012 ) identified 24 studies in peer reviewed journals with randomization or parallel cohort design involving 1431 students. Of Stress Management 53 those included in the meta -analysis, 24% of the participants were male. Focus of the analyzed research project had been to reduce stress in university students and reduce resultant anxiety and depression. Their findings suggest that CBSM interventions significantly reduce s ymp- toms of anxiety and depression scores as well as lower levels of cortisol. The meta -review by Joyce et al. (2016) focuses on workplace interventions for common mental disorders and also CBSM in the workplace environment. They identified 5179 articles an d 140 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 20 were deemed to be moderate or high quality. Together, the reviews analyzed 481 primary research studies. The authors concluded that there is evidence that CBSM programs produce significant change in ter ms of symptom reduction. Among the mention meta -analyses authors there is consensus that the methodological approach should be optimized. For example Edwards et al. (2003) criticize small sample sizes, the lack of follow - up assessments or low response at f ollow -up, the use of non -standardized measures and inadequate statistical analyses. There seems to be need for rigorously designed studies with randomized -controlled studies with follow -up assessments, which measure specific outcome parameters and include potential moderator variables. In summary it may be concluded that randomized -controlled studies provide empirical evidence that CBSM interventions yield positive results toward psychological and physiological well -being as well as endocrine and immunologi cal functioning. 4.2.4 Effects of cognitive behavioral stress management on physiological and endocrinological aspects CBSM impacts physiological aspects of the body which have been subject to evaluation studies in various fields. Most studies in this field hav e yielded consistent results. While Gaab et al. (2003) and Blumenthal et al. (2005) have shown the positive effect of CBSM on the reduction of physical arousal many studies have focused on i mmunological parameters as well as changes in the hypothalamic pit uitary axis . Stress Mana gement 54 4.2.5 Results from studies with healthy populations Antoni and colleagues (1991) evaluated 47 healthy gay men who were randomly assigned to a CBSM condition or an assessment -only control group five weeks before being notified of their human immunod eficiency virus -1 (HIV -1) antibody status. Seropositive did not increase in depression and revealed significant increases in helper -induced (CD4) and natural killer (CD56) cell counts as well as a slight increment in proliferative response to phytohemagglu ti- nin. The authors conclude that psychological buffering and immunomodulating effects of the CBSM manipulation may be attributable, at least in part, to the skills learned and practiced (Antoni et al., 1991 ). Vedhara et al. (2003) conducted a study with fo rty-three elderly spousal carers of dementia patients and twenty -seven non -carers. At the end of the CBSM training participants received an influenza vaccination and IgG antibody titers to the vaccine were measured. Immune responses to the vaccine reveale d that 50% of carers that attended the CBSM training had a fourfold increase in IgG antibody titers, compared to only 7% in the non-intervention carer group. The authors inferred that that the immune response to influenza vaccination appears amenable to im provement through CBSM training. The Zurich research group around Ehlert and Gaab conducted a series of randomized studies to show effects of CBSM on endocrine functions and psychological well -being. In a study by Gaab et al. (2003) forty -eight healthy m ale students were evaluated with the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) after completing the stress inoculation training (Meichenbaum, 2003). In comparison with the control group the treatment group showed attenuated endocrine response (d = 0.35) to the TSST. Hammerfald et al. (2006) belong to the same research group and assigned eighty -three healthy participants randomly to CBSM training or a control condition. Four months after the CBSM underwent the TSST and salivary cortisol responses were assessed before and after the stress test. The treatment group both women and men showed significantly reduced cortisol responses. The study showed that positive endocrine training effects are still observable four months after training and therefore may be seen as long -term effecti ve. Similarly, Gaab et al. (2006 ) conducted a study with twenty -eight healthy students that were in preparation for an important exam. They were randomly assigned to a four - weekly session of CBSM or a control group. Throughout the period prior t o the exam the Stress Management 55 participants in the treatment group showed reduced somatic and psychological symptoms. On the day of the exam, groups differed in their cortisol awakening responses, with significantly attenuated cortisol levels in the controls. The authors suggested that the long enduring of stress might have resulted in the inability to mount a cortisol response corresponding to the cognitive appraisal in controls could be a result of a dysregulated HPA axis. However, not all studies have found ameliorated cortisol responses to CBSM and it is indispensable to note such. Holling (1999) performed a study with police officers that underwent a CBSM training over the period of three weeks and found no noteworthy effects regarding cortisol response. However, they found long -term effects (six months and up to two years follow up) in im- proved relaxation and anger management in trained police officers compared to the controls. McCain et al. (2003) conducted a study with two different stress management interventions (CBSM and social support group training) with 148 HIV positive participants (119 men, 29 women). The research group was unable to find differences in cortisol between the two treatment and one control group. 4.2.6 Results from studies with clinical populations Chronic diseases like HIV or cancer provide a broad range of repeated severe stressors with impact on immune functioning and disease course. Inadequate coping strategies for psychoso- cial stress may lead to depressed affect, social isolation, psychiatric pro blems or impaired immune functioning and possibly accelerated disease progression (Catz et al., 2002). Cruess et al. (2000 ) conducted a study with thirty HIV -seropositive men that participated in a ten - week group -based CBSM intervention. Cortisol levels an d mood were assessed within the session. Pre -session cortisol levels decreased across the 10 -week period and were related to decreases in global measures of total mood disturbance and anxious mood. These levels were also associated with decreases in self -reported stress level during home practice. Greater reductions in cortisol during the first three session were associated with more frequent relaxation practice at h ome. Cruess and colleagues (2000 ) argue that the findings suggest that salivary cortisol rep resents an objective neuroendocrine marker for changes in anxiety and distress observed during relaxation training in symptomatic, HIV -seropositive men. Antoni Stress Management 56 (2003) demonstrated in his 10 -week group -based CBSM intervention and psychoneuroim- munologic (PNI ) model for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) that changes in relaxation skills, cognitive coping strategies and social support may mediate the mood effects of CBSM, and that these mood changes may mediate adrenal hormone regulation indicated by reduction s in 24 -h urinary cortisol (with reduced depressed mood) and norepinephrine (with reduced anxiety) and increases in CBSM -related changes in production of these hormones may explain, in part, the effects of this intervention on short -term changes in IgG ant ibody titers to herpesviruses (with increased DHEA and changes in lympho- cyte subpopulations such as CD8 suppressor/cytotoxic cells urinary noradrenaline output) and na\u00efve CD4 cells (with re ductions in urinary cortisol output) (Antoni, 2003). The author concludes that a multi -modal CBSM intervention there- fore is associated with alterations in mood, neuroendocrine functioning and immunologic status and may have favorable health implications fo r HIV infection. Similarly, Antoni and colleagues (2005) found decreased level of cortisol in HIV -positive men after a CBSM training, as well as less depressive mood. It seemed that the intervention may have affected the rate of immune system reconstitutio n by modifying the stress of symptomatic disease and the intervention might work by decreasing depressed mood and normalizing HPA axis functioning. A diagnosis of cancer and the following treatments place demands on psychological adap ta- tion. According to Antoni (201 3) behavioral research suggests the importance of cognitive, behavioral and social factor in facilitating adaptation during active treatment and throughout cancer survivorship. This supposition forms the rationale for the use psychosocial inter ven- tions with cancer patients (Antoni, 2013). A sample of twenty -nine women took part in a CBSM intervention on emotional well -being and immune function in the months following surgery for early -stage breast cancer. The participants were randomly assigned to either receive a 10 -week CBSM intervention or a comparison experience. McGregor et al. (2004) found greater perceptions of benefit from having breast cancer to the women in the compari- son group. At 3 -month follow -up women in the CBSM intervention group also had improved lymphocyte proliferation. The CBSM intervention facilitated positive emotional responses to their breast cancer experience in parallel with later improvement in cellular immune function. Stress Management 57 A 10 -week group -based CBSM intervention with eighty -five women was performed by Antoni et al. (2009). The women with stage 1 - 3 breast cancer were recruited four to eight weeks after surgery and randomized to either the CBSM intervention or a 1 -day psychoeduca- tional control group. The participants in the intervention group evidenced better psychosocial adaptation (lower reported cancer -specific anxiety and interviewer -rated general anxiety symptoms) and physiological adaptation (lower cortisol, greater Th1 cytokine [interleukin -2 and interferon - production and IL -2:IL-4 ratio) after their additional treatment compared to those in the control group. The psychosocial effects as well as the cortisol appeared to hold across the entire twelve -month observation period, while Th1 cytokine regulation changes held only over the initial 6 -month period. Finally, Antoni and colleagues (2016) investigated relations between inflammatory indicators and distress, negative mood and dep ressive symptoms in women undergoing primary treatment for non -metastatic breast cancer. They demonstrated in a randomized -controlled trial that women receiving a CBSM intervention vs. a psycho -education showed improved mood, decreased circulating cortiso l and reduced leukocyte inflammatory signaling in the first twelve months of breast cancer treatment. Furthermore, they demonstrated better health outcomes up to 15 years later (disease free interval and survival time). While women with greater depressive symptoms after surgery showed significantly greater levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL -1b, IL -6, TNF -a) in serum. Antoni et al. (2016) also found that negative affect was associated with greater leukocyte proinflammatory and pro -metastatic gene expres sion. Further evidence that CBSM may be helpful in the development of diseases stems from rheumatoid arthritis and gestational diabetes. De Brouwer et al. (2016) performed a study with 74 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The participants were randomly assigned to a CBSM treatment or a control group. 1 -week after treatment and at 9 -week follow up the TSST was performed. Basal and stress -induced cytokine levels did not differ between the groups one week after treatment, but stress -induced IL -8 levels wer e lower in patients in the intervention group at the follow -up assessment. The authors hypothesize that immune parameters might be altered after a psychosocial stress task in a population with immune dysfunction. The effectiveness of CBSM on psychological stress and diabetic pregnant women has been evaluated in a randomized -controlled study by Zaheri et al. (2016). Eighty -Stress Management 58 eight women with gestational diabetes were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. In the CBSM group stress significantly decreased two weeks after the training and psychological well -being improved. Furthermore, glycemic control improved as well. Improvement in psychological well -being, i.e. decrease in depression, anxiety and stress may lead to better well -being and glycem ic control. Overall it may be concluded that the evidence that CBSM may positively alter physiological and endocrinological aspects when confronted with stress is mounting. 4.2.7 Effects of cognitive behavioral stress management on psychological well -being A diagnosis of an illness like cancer or HIV and the subsequent treatments is stressful and places high demands on psychological adaptation. It may involve fear of being damaged by adjuvant therapy, not seeing children grow, premature death, and loss of social ties and activities (Stanton, 2006). As described above, evidence suggests that CBSM interventions trigger positive effects on neuroendocrine and immune functioning in healthy and patient populations. Fortunately, these changes in physiological processes are mostly associated with mood improvement. 4.2.8 Results from studies with clinical populations Proceeding with clinical populations it was shown that positive coping skills, along with a high sense of coping self -efficacy, are associated with stress resistan ce and better psychologi- cal adjustment. Mulder et al. (1995) showed that HIV -infected individuals who used such active coping skills also had fewer symptoms of HIV disease progression than those who did not. Good psychological adjustment, like active copin g lead to better resilience and are associated with reduced disease progression. Crepaz et al. (2008) found HIV -infected indi- viduals who received CBSM training showed significant improvement in psychological factors including depression, anxiety, anger, an d stress when compared to controls. Antoni et al. (2006 b) assigned breast cancer patients to CBSM vs. a psychoeducational group and in the weeks after surgery but prior to the onset of adjuvant therapy the CBSM group showed Stress Management 59 medium to large effect size dec reases in negative affect (d = 0.33), thought intrusions (d = 1.22), anxiety (d = 0.74), and interpersonal disruption (d = 0.53) while also increasing positive affect (d = 0.31), benefit finding (d = 0.82), and positive states of mind (d = 1.16) for up to one year. Bower and Segerstrom (2004) report four types of benefits observed by patients in a CBSM study with women with early -stage breast cancer and see them as mirror- ing previous research (McGregor et al., 2004). One type of benefit is a more patient, ac cepting attitude towards life, including a greater ability to adjust to events that cannot be changed and to take things as they come. The second benefit is a positive change in self -view, specifically a perception of oneself as stronger and better able to manage stress and problems. A third type of benefit is a change in interpersonal relationships, a stronger sense of connection and greater empathy. The fourth type of benefit is a deeper sense of purpose in life and a greater focus on important goals and priorities (Bower & Segerstrom, 2004). While CBSM did not approach these benefits directly, it is conceivable that cognitive restructuring and coping skills training that promote the development of more adaptive coping skills may have helped to towards a more accepting attitude toward life and have been helpful to foster a positive change in self - view. The stronger sense of connection and interpersonal relationships as well as the deeper sense of purpose in life might be attributed to the didactic training in use of social support and enhanced by the expression and support promoted by the group experience. Collectively these studies provide strong evidence that CBSM interventions during active treatment can reliably modulate indicators of stress, affect and adversity and support positive experiences for extended periods of time. 4.2.9 Results from studies with healthy populations - group training CBSM has shown to ameliorate various aspects of psychological well -being as has been extensively discussed in the revi ew of recent meta -analyses. Gaab et al. (2003) found that in a randomized -controlled trial of healthy participants the CBSM group had lower stress apprais- al, a better self -concept of own competence and higher control expectancies during the standardized st ress test TSST. Furthermore, the treatment group showed a reduction in the level of perceived stress in post treatment. Van Rhenen et al. (2005) investigated two short -Stress Manageme nt 60 term stress management programs one of which was CBSM while the other was focusing on physical exercise and relaxation. Both interventions revealed positive impact on psychologi- cal complaints such as burnout, fatigue, anxiety and fatigue both at short -term and at 6 -month follow -up. It needs to be noted that van Rhenen et al. (2005) conducted the study unfortunate- ly without a control group. Granath and colleagues (2006) evaluated and compared a CBSM intervention with a Yoga program. The study was performed with 33 participants (26 women and 7 men) that participated 10 sessions of over a period of four months. Psychological and physiological measurement were obtained before and after treatment. Both groups improved during the treatment and there was no significant difference in results. However, perceived stress decreased significantly in CBSM (d = 1.42) and Yoga (d = 0.82) as well as ratings on the stress behavior scale (CBSM d = 1.17 and Yoga d = 0.70) decreased significantly in both programs. Ratings of anger decreased only in the CBSM group (d = 0.75). It is notable that at post-examination co rtisol levels increased, although not significantly. In a study by Gaab et al. (2006) students underwent a CBSM during their preparation for an important exam and participants in the randomly assigned CBSM group showed significantly lower anxiety throughou t the period prior to the exam. In another study by Keogh et al. (2006) with 209 students that were randomly allocated to a CBSM or a non -intervention control group it was found that students that took part in the CBSM delivered better exam results, height ened motivational scores and a reduction in dysfunctional cognitions and attitudes. Tsang et al. (2013) explored the efficacy of a CBSM training for teachers who experienced mild levels of stress, anxiety and/or depressive symptoms in a quasi -experimental study. The intervention group had significant reduction in depression (d = 0.69), anxiety (d = 0.62) and stress (d = 0.66) when compared with the control group. 4.2.10 Results from studies with healthy populations - internet based training A newer form of traini ng are technology -based behavioral health programs (e.g., computer or web-based programs). According to Rose et al. (2013) stress management has empirical support, but little data on its efficacy with stressed but healthy individuals that employ such interventions. In a study with 66 healthy participants they evaluated a self guided, multimedia CBSM program which was developed for ultimate use by the National Aeronautics and Space Stress Management 61 Administration (NASA). The intervention group was compared to an attention co ntrol group that received videos and reading material on stress management. The treatment group reported medium to large effects in perceived stress and increases in control over stress as compared to the control group from pre - to post -assessment in the T SST. Interestingly, the program evaluated is ultra -brief with 6 sessions that last 30 - 45 minutes and the users were very satisfied with it. Another web -based training using CBSM to alleviate stress among employ- ees was evaluated by Mori et al. (2014). In the randomized -controlled study 168 participants enrolled and the training group received CBSM training by a qualified expert and one month of follow -up web -based CBSM homework. The training groups ability to recognize dysfunc- tional thinking was significan tly improved both immediately after training completion (d = 0.37) and after six months (d = 0.33). However, the ability to cope with stress did not improve immediately after training, it was improved after six months (d = 0.37). In another study by Hintz et al. (2015) a CBSM online intervention was assessed with 292 psychology students. The intervention groups had lower levels of stress, depression and anxiety symptoms as well as perceived stress relative to the information -only control group. It has bee n demonstrated that the field of CBSM is effective for clinical populations as well as for healthy ones. While one -to-one and group -setting have been the most prevalent in the past it may be expected that the digital revolution will leave its mark also in this field. 4.3 Kinesiology Recently a growing field of interventions against the detrimental effects of stress comes from complementary medicine. Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) or complemen- tary medicine has spread considerably over the last th ree decades. Compared to the popularity of the methods in the general population the available data regarding efficiency and efficacy of the methods is generally not strong . The german term \"Erfahrungsmedizin\" which can be translated to \"experienced -based medicine\" shows the self -identity of the methods. Priority has the experience of the individual and scientific principles are not focal. One of the widely - known methods in Switzerland is kinesiology and shall be depicted in detail. Stress Management 62 4.3.1 Overview complementary and alternative medicine 4.3.1.1 Definition of complementary medicine In the western world, there has been a movement in the field of health care. It will be shown that the rates of utilization of complementary medicine have risen and that it may be assumed that in the US and Europe there are hardly any people that do not have at least a very vague idea of what complementary medicine is (K\u00f6ntopp, 2004). Acupuncture or homeopathy are terms that almost belong to the general vocabulary. But the field of complementary medicine is widespread and there are many, oftentimes quasi -analogous, terms to describe those methods outside of conventional medicine. The naming of the field itself is part of an ongoing discussion. Before the 1970s many other terms had been in use, f. e. \"biological medicine\", \"holistic medicine\" medicine\" (Uehleke & Saller, 2011). Over the last three decades there have been numerous efforts to define comple- mentary medicine , but there is lack of consens us about definitions even though this may have negative implications for research and clinical practice (Falkenberg et al., 2012). Academical- ly the term CAM is widespread and the two parts complementary and alternative are often used as synonyms and differ ences in understanding of these terms are often marginal (Caspi et al., 2003). The definition that \"the sum of unconventional therapies is CAM\" is not selective enough and too fuzzy (Uehleke & Saller, 2011). Interestingly to date there is a European as wel l as an American definition of what CAM is. The European CAMbrella project defined CAM as follows: \"CAM utilized by European citizens represents a variety of different medical systems and therapies based on the knowledge, skills and practices derived from theories, philosophies and experiences used to maintain and improve health, as well as to prevent, diagnose, relieve or treat physical and mental illnesses. CAM has been mainly used outside conventional health care, but in some countries certain treatments are being adopted or adapted by conventional health care (Eardley et al., 2012).\" The National center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), defines CAM as group of different interventions that b elong not yet to conventional medicine. A unifying characteristic is that mostly there is not yet enough evidence that they are accepted as part of conventional medicine (NCCIH, 2014). This US definition divides Stress Management 63 CAM into five main domains: Alternative medi cine systems, biologically based practices, manipulative and body -based therapies, mind -body interventions, and energy therapies (NCCIH, 2014). 4.3.1.2 Usage of complementary medicine The usage of methods of complementary medicine is widespread in the population of Europe, the United States and Australia. The World Health Organization (WHO) published the WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014 -2023, which recognized that the demand for complemen- tary medicine is increasing globally (WHO, 2014). Nearly 40% of Americ an adults have used one or more therapies that fall into one of the five domains of complementary medicine (Clark e et al., 2015) and this is underlined by the findings of a research project by Versnik Nowak et al. (2015) who found that nearly 80% of Ivy le ague college students had used at least one form of complementary medicine in the last 12 months. For Europe prevalence data has been shown to be between 0.3 - 86%. The data showed substantial heterogeneity and the picture of complementary medicine preval ence across the EU member states remains unclear (Eardley et al., 2012). However, the European Information Centre of Complementary & Alternative Medicine (EICCAM, 2008) suggest that more than 100 million EU citizens are regular users of CAM. In Switzerlan d, the following situation presents itself regarding CAM: With a remarkable 2/3 of the Swiss population voting in a national referendum in favor of complementary medicine being anchored in the federal constitution this was interpreted as unambiguous to inc lude complementary medicine as part of modern medicine (Saller, 2009). Klein et al. (2015) found, that 25% of Swiss of 15 and older had used at least one method of complementary medicine in the previous 12 months and in a longitudinal study in Switzerland R\u00f6ssler et al. (2007) found an increase of usage of complementary medicine of 34.7% from 1993 (21.9%) to 1999 (29.5%). Also, the signific ance of complementary medicine may be derived from the fact that 59.9% of the adult population had a supplemental healt h insurance that partly covered such treatments (Klein et al. , 2015). Stress Management 64 Table 8: Five major types domains of CAM (NCCIH, 2014) Description Examples of methods Whole Medical Systems Whole medical systems are built upon complete systems of theory and p ractice. These systems have evolved apart from and earlier than the conventional medical approach. Traditional Chinese Medicine Ayurveda Homeopathy Biologically based Practices They use substances found in nature, such as herbs, foods, and vitamins . Dietary supplements Herbal products Phytotherapy Manipulative and body -based Therapies Therapies that are based on manipulation and/or movement of one or more parts of the body. Massage Chiropractic Osteopathy Mind -Body interven- tions These i nterventions use a variety of techniques designed to enhance the mind's capacity to affect bodily functions and symptoms. Some techniques that were considered CAM in the past have become mainstream (f.e. patient support groups and cognitive -behavioral ther apy) Meditation Therapies that use creative outlets such as art, music, or dance Kinesiology Energy therapies Energy therapies involve the use of energy fields: Biofield therapies: are intended to affect energy fields that purportedly surround and penetrate the human body. Bioelectromagnetic -based therapies: Involve the unconventional use of electromagnetic fields Biofield therapies: Qi Gong Therapeutic touch Bioelectromagnetic -based therapies: Pulsed fields Magnetic fields 4.3.2 Development of Ki nesiology and Integrative Kinesiology Kinesiology was initially developed by the Chiropractor George Goodheart in the 1960s. Goodheart started experimenting with a biofeedback system that was first used in physiother- apy and later in chiropractic and which is known as manual muscle testing (MMT). He Stress Management 65 observed that sometimes a muscle tested weak, but there was no atrophy or other apparent reason for the weakness. On one occasion he observed nodules at the origin of the patient's serratus anterior muscle and up on deep goading of the nodules, the muscle immediately returned to almost normal strength (Walther, 2000). This experience led to discovery of Applied Kinesiology and the initial development toward correcting structural imbalance caused by poorly functioni ng muscles. Goodheart came up with a new idea for working with muscles. He concluded that when muscles felt tight, or in spasm, causing pain and pulling the spine out of line it was not really the symptomatic muscle causing the trouble, but that weak muscl es on one side of the body can cause normal muscles opposing to become or seem tight. The general idea was rather than working with the symptomatic muscle, the weak muscle should be strengthened (Thie, 1973). The MMT became the instrument of AK to understa nd the \"body language \" and to use the muscles as indicators. The technique of muscle testing Goodheart used was that of physiotherapists Florence and Henry Kendall (Goodheart, 2000). Consequently, the method was termed Applied Kinesiology (AK) and the word kinesiology indicates that AK essentially is about movement, specifically about activation and movement of muscles. 4.3.3 Philosophy and Principles of Kinesiology The philosophical background of kinesiology is an assumption shared with chiropractic. It is that the body has an \"innate intelligence\", the ability of the body to regulate and repair itself, which is also referred to as homeostasis. Therefore, it is the endeavor of the therapist to strengthen the body for that it can heal itself. The assumption can b e summarized to: Health comes from within. The founder of chiropractic, Daniel D. Palmer, postulated another important element of kinesiology which is the idea of the \"Triad of Health\" (Palmer, 1911). It is a holistic model where health is composed of stru ctural, chemical and mental factors that should be balanced, forming an equilateral triangle. When a person experiences symptoms or poor health one or more of the three factors are out of balance (Walther, 2000). Kinesiology may then be used to identify th e triad's balance and with which interventions the equilibrium may be reinstated. The innate intelligence that governs the whole system may be seen as a self-regulating system . Stress Management 66 Figure 8: Triad of Health This view is complemented by theoretical aspects o f ancient and Traditional Chinese Medi- cine (TCM). Biochemistry, anatomy, and physiology form the groundwork for modern biomedicine, but are of little importance to traditional East Asian medicine. What it concerns is organizing signs and symptoms to arrive at an accurate perception of \"what is going on\" (Kaptchuk, 2000). Chinese medicine looks at the patient and is not seeking a pathological mechanism behind the veil of symptoms. What concerns the medical professional in Chinese medicine, is gaining a flexi ble perspective on the dynamic texture of a person's life. The first goal, right after the therapeutic alliance, is to organize signs and symptoms to an emblematic image. Fundamental are the ideas of life energy Chi, the polar principles of Yin and Yang as well as the theory of the Five Elements. Especially important is the notion of Chi in TCM medical thought. While Chi sometimes is translated to \"vital energy\", it is much more than that. As Chinese thoughts distinguish less between matter and energy, Chi is in between. But it is also the thread connecting all being and may take a myriad of forms (Kaptchuk, 2000). It could be hypothesized that \"innate intelligence\" is only a form of Chi and that kinesiology is about bringing Chi into balance in the human be ing. Stress Management 67 4.3.4 Procedures and techniques The integration of Chinese medicine and philosophy into kinesiology made it possible to see physical, mental/emotional and chemical dysbalances as expressions of energetic patterns. Therefore, the kinesiological perspective is the combination of the holistic western (Triad of health) and the holistic eastern (Chi) health models. The results of the MMT indicate a dysbalanced of Chi and which intervention is able to harmonize it. The MMT is the tool which enables a biofeedback that adds to the perception and communication in the therapeutic setting. The MMT promotes self -awareness by indicating to dysbalances, before they are cognitively accessible. The work in clinical practice suggests that in kinesiology forms such as Integra tive Kinesiology (IK), the therapeutic dialogue with integration of the MMT leads to situations where cognitive aspects of a problem are complemented by aspects t hat are subcon- sciously stored. This integration of conscious and subconscious in relation to t he problem situation, helps to gather relevant information as to what is helpful and what are harmful behaviors and attitudes. This leads to a more differentiated self -perception and to resources that may be utilized for the healing process. Those resource s may than be supported by activating meridians, different reflex points or other kinesiological balancing techniques. 4.3.5 Different forms of Kinesiology AK and its discoveries were the pillar on which various forms of kinesiology developed. Fundamentally ther e are two forms of kinesiology that need to be distinguished: a) Applied Kinesiology and b) Specialized Kinesiology. Table 9: Forms of kinesiology Applied Kinesiology Specialized Kinesiology Who can learn it Limited to medical professionals such as: Chiropractors Osteopathists Physiotherapists Registered Naturopaths Open to non -medical applicants Stress Management 68 Muscle test result MMT as diagnostic tool in conjunction with other diagnostic tools utilized Momentarily and situational dependent result of the M MT .

Eardley et al. (2013) report of Professional Kinesiology Practice (PKP), a form of specialized kinesiology, but then write about the \"diagnostic tool the muscle t est\" is being used where at best it could be an energetic diagnose, and by definition not a diagnose in the sense of medical diagnose. In the 1970s John Thie developed the first non -diagnostic form of kinesiology and for reasons of clarity it was named \" Touch for Health\" and specifically not kinesiology. Thie included easy to use techniques from AK that did not have any contraindications and built a solution - oriented, salutgenetic form of kinesiology. Touch for Health's goal was to be effective in the health prevention and help families to proactively and self -competent promote their health (Thie, 1973). While the MMT was used it was only to identify where the energy Chi is not in balance and to restore it with body -oriented balance techniques such as mass age of reflex points or meridian activation. The MMT was strictly used to indicate dysbalances and identify the resource that could restore it. Success of the intervention was evaluated on a visual or verbal analogue scale. On the basis of Touch for Health a second generation of kinesiology methods developed. Those include for example: Stress Management 69 Table 10: Second generation of kinesiology types Name of kinesiology Founder Length of training Applied Physiology (Utt, 1997) Richard Utt Weekend / Weekly seminars Edu-Kinesthetic (Dennison, 2006) Paul Dennison Weekend / Weekly seminars Hyperton X (Mahony, 1993) Frank Mahon y Weekend / Weekly seminars Integrative Kinesiology (Sonderegger, 2005) Rosmarie Sonderegger 3 years professional program Professional Ki nesiology Practitioner (Dewe, 1990) Bruce Dewe 1942 - Weekend / Weekly seminars Three in one Concepts (Stokes & Whiteside, 2007) Gordon Stokes and Daniel Whiteside Weekend / Weekly seminars These types of kinesiology vary mainly in the interpretat ion of the MMT, the techniques applied and the form of client/therapist interaction. Tschernitschek and Fink (2005) in their review suggest that there is need for clear definitions of the groups of kinesiology. The field of Specialized Kinesiology may be d ivided in sectors as well: Table 11: Dialogue interaction with therapist - underlying assumptions accepted by conventional medicine High Low Importance of dialogue with therapist Importance of dialogue with therapist High Underlying assumptions (other than kinesiological) are currently accepted by conventional medicine IK Edu-K TFH Low Underlying assumptions are currently accepted by conventional medicine 3 in 1 Applied Phyisology Hyperton -X Stress Management 70 The client experience and satisfaction has to our knowledge not been researched. With the heterogeneity of types of kinesiology it could be expected, that orientation in the field of kinesiology and deciding what or what not to choose is experienced as difficult by clients interested to choose the m ethod. In Switzerland, the significance of complementary medicine may be derived from the fact that Klein et al. (2015) have shown that 59.9% of the adult population had a supplemental health insurance that covered complementary medicine treatments and c onsequently also kinesiolo- gy. To our knowledge there is not much recent data regarding the utilization of kinesiology for health reasons or how many therapists are active with kinesiology. In 1998 Kristof et al. found that 31% of the Swiss women they surve yed had experienced kinesiology, but the sample was relatively small and further research would be helpful. The recent development of professional development of complementary medicine has led to an advanced federal d iploma of professional education and tr aining in complementary therapy in which kinesiology is included as a method (OdA KT, 2012). The profile of profession as well as the structured process of accrediting professional programs is expected to lead to better treatment results and is part of the development from a simple complementary methods to a veritable profession. 4.3.6 Limitations and ethical considerations of Kinesiology The MMT is easy to perform, but complex to interpret. At first sight the results of the MMT might reflect a yes/no -scheme wit h the result being some kind of truth -finder. While for lay people this interpretation might be standing to reason, it is a simplification that does not reflect the complexity of the process and is not vindicable (Sonderegger, 2008) . Already Goodheart emph asized that the MMT indicates more pre -clinical conditions and is for AK a supplement to the existing medical diagnostic instruments (Schmitt & Cuthbert, 2008). The following considerations are important: The MMT result is a momentarily reflection of the energy system taken in a working context between a therapist and a client. Solitary the MMT is not valid to base decisions on the results or make any (medical) diagnosis with it. It is only with the contextual interpretation of the result that it becomes a valid instrument of communi- cation and indication of inner processes. The results need to put into perspective of the clients Stress Management 71 life experience and a coherent fit in for the client. A kinesiological intervention therefore always needs to be reflected upon th e context it developed and development steps should promote the dynamic personal equilibrium (Sonderegger, 2005; Sonderegger, 2008) 1980s Rosmarie Sonderegger a licensed social worker and psychologist got into contact with TFH in Switzerland. With her person -centered psychological education, she worked in a private practice with clients. Upon learning the MMT and TFH from John Thie personally she immediately integrated the techniques in her private sessions work with clients. She used the MMT during the conversation with the client to make subconscious dysfunctional patterns conscious and cognitively accessible. She noticed that the clients were able to reflect and alter behavior and thought patterns faster and that the effect sustained. Clients felt positive and better after the sessions and seemed to reach their therapy goal earlier (Sonderegger, 2005). It may be hypothesized that through the person -centered dialog in combination with the MMT the clients would gain a d eeper self -understanding and the question was if the MMT acted as a form of indicator system of automatic thoughts and emotions. This type of kinesiology was termed integrative because it integrated therapeutic conversation into a formerly body -technique o nly. 4.3.8 Therapeutic approach of Integrative Kinesiology The method is being used in one on one setting as well as in group settings. In the therapeutic setting with client and kinesiologist the process begins with a systematic review of the clients' concern. In this encounter phase the emphasis is on building rapport, understanding the issue and what the favorable direction of development is. The second phase, termed process phase , the MMT is used as biofeedback instrument to challenge assumptions, discover a reas of strain and what the underlying inhibiting process could be. It is being ascertained what cognitive respectively emotional patterns or what physical inhibitions might be connected to the topic and how they may be transformed with kinesiological inte rventions. The integration phase Stress Management 72 then activates the bodily system with congenial kinesiological techniques aimed at activating the bodily resources. The kinesiological process is completed with the transformation phase in which it is being elaborated on ho w to support the process in the time to follow. The group setting also follows the four process steps, with the difference that a topic is presented at the beginning and then processed with the group. 4.3.9 Evaluation of kinesiology The evaluation of kinesiolo gy may be attempted by trying to identify the fundamental principles behind the method or trying to capture the effects of the intervention. The former would be what Heinz von Foerster called the way of \"scientia\", the word which stems from the indoeuropea n \"ski\" which is in sci -ence ord schi -zophrenia and is the word for separation (Mikul\u00e1s & Moser, 2013). The idea behind it is to understand the whole, it needs to be separated in its parts and those must be understood first. The question may be raised if a treatment approach with a holistic philosophical approach would not better be researched as a system and therefore, would prioritize the evaluation of efficacy and efficiency and in a second phase the underlying principles. AK as well as kinesiology fie lds have been subject to various research projects (f.e. Eardley et al., 2013; Schwartz et al., 2014) as well as to review articles (f.e. Cuthbert & Goodheart, 2007; Hall et al., 2008; Rosner & Cuthbert, 2012 or Tschernitscheck & Fink, 2005). The evidence found is ambivalent. There are several issues but quality of research projects in many cases does not fulfill the requirements of scientific standards (Hall et al., 2008; Jensen et al., 2016). A common problem that confounds the research is the differentia tion of the types of kinesiology, especially between the diagnostic form of AK and the holistic form of specialized kinesiologies. In research projects (f.e. Jensen et al., 2016) the MMT is used as a standalone diagnostic test which is against the theoreti cal principles of the MMT. Jensen et al. (2016) as well as Tschernitschek urge the field of kinesiology to conduct randomized con- trolled trials (RCT) with standards that are accepted by the scientific community. Stress Management 73 However, as the field of complementary medic ine and therefore also kinesiology is less popular in traditional medicine, the scientific approach to evaluate interventions is less known. It is therefore important to define research protocols that are easy to apply and are cost effective. Also it shoul d be based on a research protocol that has been extensively published in order to ensure that it is widely accepted. To further gain understanding of complementary methods and aid future research has been an important part of formulating this research proj ect. PART II: EMPIRICAL STUDY 74 PART II: EMPIRICAL STUDY 5 Summary and research question Maintaining health in a complex and globalize d world with almost unlimited daily and chronic challenges is important, both from a therapeutical microperspective as well as from a societal macro perspective. This view may have contributed to the Swiss Federal Council 's decision to define in its \"Health 2020\" strategy that an effective system of mental health prevention should be developed and that the focal point should be on the individual to rai se the health competence and improve well -being (Swiss Federal Depa rtment of Home Affairs, 2013). In congruence with this mission and with the idea to not only evaluate a two day group stress management seminar, we went forward to compare a known method o f comple- mentary medic ine within this study. The rational behind this was a) that complementary medicine is a growing field that has not been subject to many RCT research projects, but also b) test a study design that could be used for various methods that claim to help reducing stress. In review articles by Hall et al. (2008) as well as Tschernitschek and Fink (2005) pragmatic studies on the effectiveness of kinesiology were demanded as they did not find sufficient studies that used adequate protocols to as sess the effectiveness of the method. Hence, we hypothesize d that a) The stress management group will show blunted cortisol responses in a standardized psychosocial stress test compared to the control group b) The kinesiology group will show blunted cortisol responses in a standardized psycho- social stress test compared to the control group Summary and research question 75 c) Both treatment groups will show favourable development in the psychometric charac- teristics measured at the beginning of the study and again before the day of the psy- chosoc ial stress test. Theref ore, the primary purpose of this thesis was to evaluate the effects of kinesiology and cognitive behavioral stress management on psychological well -being as well as on neuroen- docrine response to a standardized stress test in healthy participants. A secondary goal was to review and promote a test procedure, which could be utilized for intervention studies in further methods of complementary medicine. The IKSIT study 76 6 The IKSIT study The study was conducted in Zurich (Switzerland) over a period of si x months. It followed a detailed plan that is depicted in the following: Figure 11: Outline of the research project. FKK (Selfconcept of own competence); PSS (Perceived Stress Scale); of Coherence); SRS Reactivity Scale), SWE (Perceiv ed Self -Efficacy) The IKSIT study 77 6.1 Methods 6.1.1 Participant s Before the recruitment process was initiated the research protocol was submitted to the ethics committee of the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Clini- calTrials.gov number, CT0133157 7). The ethics committee decided that the study was harmless and formal approval of the ethics committee not necessary. The study was conduct- ed according to the declaration of Helsinki. Advertisement of the study was via online publication and a website in which the study as well as the exclusion criteria were briefly described. Interested healthy subjects had the opportunity to enroll online. The subjects had to be between 18 and 50 years of age, accepted randomization and were fluent in German. They were then sent a screening questionnaire, containing exclusion criteria designed to reduce confounding factors that have shown to affect physiological dependent measures: Any previous participation in stress research projects (to ensure novelty to the TSST pr otocol), regular or occasional intake of any medication or addictive substances, any self -reported acute or chronic somatic or mental disorders, smoking more than five cigarettes/day, consumption of more than 2 alcoholic drinks/day or any previous practica l experience with stress manage- ment training or kinesiology. If women were pregnant, were planning a pregnancy or were using oral contraceptives during the study they were also excluded. This information was confirmed in a telephone interview in which all subjects received an oral description of the study and were able to clarify questions. Subsequently, the subjects were also provided with a complete written description of the study and written informed consent was obtained. Once baseline examination was c ompleted, the participants were randomly assigned to either the The IKSIT study 78 stress management group (SMG), kinesiology group (KIG) or the waiting list control group (CG). An independent research assistant performed the structured randomization procedure. Allocation co ncealment was achieved through the use of sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed envelopes. To assure gender balance the procedure was performed for women and men separately. The participant inclusion process is depicted in Figure 11. Figure 11: Flow d iagram for the progress through the phases of the randomized trial (based on the consolidated standards of reporting trials (CONSORT) recommendations. The IKSIT study 79 6.1.2 Procedure Two different approaches for future coping with stress were applied to separate groups, while the CG absolved the training after completion of the study. After allotment to the group the participants were invited to a two -day group seminar (Saturday and Sunday). Daily sessions lasted from 9.00 a.m. to 5 p.m. and were performed by two experienced the rapists in cognitive behavior therapy and kinesiology respectively. Both trainers had the same experience and were both female. Also b oth groups followed a standardized training manual. No exercises or role-plays used in the training resembled the situatio n used in the standardized stress test. 6.1.2.1 Stress management training The SMG attended a group -based cognitive -behavioral stress management (CBSM) training which based on the principles of the stress inoculation training developed by Meichenbaum (1985) and is described in detail elsewhere (Gaab et al. , 2003). During the two days the training focused on four cognitive -behavioral techniques: cognitive restructuring, problem solving, self -instruction as well as relaxation modules (progressive muscle relaxation). After a theoretical introduction and a group -discussion about the transactional stress concept, each stress -reducing technique was introduced and practiced. All participants received a training manual containing a summary of the applied theoretical models as well as the descriptions of the stress reducing techniques. The IKSIT study 80 6.1.2.2 Kinesiology treatment The second treatment group underwent kinesiology training. Kinesiology is a complementary health approach, which is categorized under the mind -body practices. The U.S. National Institutes of Health (2010) characterized these as methods focusing on the interactions among the brain, mind, body, and behavior, with the intent of using those interactions to promote health. Kinesiology as a term is used for a wide variety of m ethods utilizing subtle change in manual muscle testing to detect information about mind -body processes. It is based on the concept of balanced qi (an ancient term given to what is believed to be vital energy) that is assumed to flow through meridians thro ughout the body. Qi is proposed to regulate a persons' emotional, mental and physical balance. To the contrary disease is seen as a consequence of an imbalance of qi. The belief is that all of the body's systems work together and that disturb- ances in the q i energy system may affect function elsewhere in the body. Kinesiology seeks to restore the mind/body balance by utilizing different techniques. Among the components are goal-setting, acupressure, massage, meridian activation and exercises. However, kinesi ology needs to be differentiated into the medical and diagnostic form of kinesiology called Applied Kinesiology and non -medical, non -diagnostic forms of kinesiology, which are described elsewhere (McDowall & Cuthbert, 2008; Sonderegger, 2008). During the t wo days the kinesiology training focused on the following content: Introduction to the concept of kinesiol- ogy and stress, muscle testing and applying it to discover personal areas of stress, kinesiology exercises, acupressure tapping technique as well as g oal setting in challenging situations to reduce negative effects of stress. All participants received a training manual containing a summary of the workshop as well as the descriptions of the stress reducing techniques. The IKSIT study 81 6.1.2.3 Psychosocial Stress Test The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) is a laboratory protocol for reliable stimulation of biomarkers of psychosocial stress (Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004). It has repeatedly been found to induce profound endocrine responses in 70 -85% of the participants tested (Kirschbau m et al., 1993; Foley & Kirschbaum, 2010). Participants were invited to a scheduled appointment between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. in a building and setting novel to all participants. With the invita- tion participants had been instructed not to eat, drink anything b ut water 2 hours preceding the TSST and to refrain from intense physical activities 24h before the experiment. All personnel involved during the experiment were blind to group assignment. Upon arrival they were welcomed and received a high glucose drink (3 00ml) to raise blood glucose levels, as low glucose levels have been shown by Kirschbaum et al. (1997) to blunt stress -induced increases of cortisol. After a brief introduction to the TSST (2 minutes) they gave a basal sample of salivary free cortisol. In a separate preparation room, they had 10 minutes alone to prepare for an imaginary job interview and they then performed the mock job interview (5 minutes) as well as the mental arithmetic exercise (5 minutes) 2 m in front of two evaluative panel members d ressed in white laboratory coats and a video camera (Kirschbaum et al., 1993). The panel consisted of one female and one male member (female psychologist and male retired manager). Saliva samples were obtained immediately before, and one, 10, 20, 30, 45 an d 60 min after the TSST. After completion all participants were debriefed and asked to refrain from informing other participants regarding the TSST. The IKSIT study 82 6.1.3 Outcome measure s For the evaluation of training effects psychometric as well as physiological measures were obtained. Stress reactivity of repeated salivary cortisol levels (i.e. the interaction group -by- stress) was defined as the primary outcome measure. Secondary measures were development of the psychometric assessments over the period of the study. Points of measurement were: 1. After randomization but before group -treatment, respectively waiting condition. All participants were given a set of questionnaires to allow assessment of the development of psychological characteristics during the course of the study. T he questionnaires (see below) were administered at baseline and after the group intervention, one week prior to the TSST examination day. 2. For the endocrine evaluation of stress salivary free cortisol was chosen as biomarker. The collection of saliva is non-invasive, the procedure straightforward and due to the numerous publications using it as measure for the hypothalamus \u2014pituitary\u2014adrenal axis\u00b4 (HPAA) adaptation to stress it was seen as very well evaluated and well - established. Therefore, at the examina tion day stress reactivity was measured through the cortisol profile during TSST procedure. 6.1.3.1 Psychometric measures The psychological development in the domains of depressive symptoms (ADS -K), perceived stress (PSS) and stress reactivity (SRS), sense of coh erence (SOC), self -concept (FKK) as The IKSIT study 83 well as self -efficacy (SWE) during the test period were measured with the following psycho- metric instruments: Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (Radloff, 1977), German version (Allgemeine Depressions S kala-Kurzform (ADS -K), Hautzinger & Bailer, 1993). It was specifically developed to assess depressive affect and negative thought patterns for use in investigations in nonclinical samples. It has shown good internal consistency with Cron- bach's = .90. Questionnaire for Competence and Control Orientations (Fragebogen zur Kontroll\u00fcberzeugung und Kompetenzerwartung (FKK)). The 32 -item en, 1989) assesses the following personality traits (Cronbach's ): self -concept of own competence (Cron bach's = , chance control (Cronbach's = .75) , internality (Cronbach's = .70) and powerful others control (Cronbach's = .73). Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). This 10 -item questionnaire (Cronbach's = .78) was used to assess the degree to which s ituations in life (in the last month) were perceived as stressful. Items were designed to assess how predictable, uncontrollable, and overloading participants perceive their lives (Cohen & Williamson, 1988). Sense of Coherence (SOC). SOC is an important resource promoting coping and health in daily life stressful ev ents (Eriksson & Lindstr\u00f6m, 2005 ). It is characterized as a personal way of thinking, being, and acting, with an inner trust, which leads people to identify, benefit, use The IKSIT study 84 and re -use the resourc es at their dis posal 2005 ). The SOC -L9 et al., 2000) is conceptualized as a unidimensional scale assessing the sense of coherence in a reliable, valid and economical way (Cronbach's = .87). Stress Reactivity Scale (SRS ). Stressreactivity is the extent to which people are likely to show emotional or physical reactions to stressful events. Schulz et al. (2005) recommend the questionnaire specifically as a tool to evaluate stress management programs. Good internal consiste ncy is reported (Cronbach's = .91). Self Efficacy Scale (Selbstwirksamkeitserwartung, SWE). The scale assesses a general sense of perceived self -efficacy with the aim to predict coping with daily hassles as well as adapta- tion after experiencing stressfu l life events. Schwarzer and Jerusalem (1995) report good internal consistency (Cronbach's = between .80 and .90) 6.1.3.2 Endocrinological measurement Saliva was collected using Salivette (Sarstedt AG, Sevelen, Switzerland) collection devices. Samples were sto red at -20C until biochemical analysis took place. Salivary free cortisol was analyzed by using a commercial chemiluminescence immunoassay with high sensitivity of 0.16 ng/ml (IBL Hamburg, Germany). Inter - and intra -assay coefficients of variation were below 10%. To reduce error variance caused by imprecision of the intra -assay all samples The IKSIT study 85 were analyzed in the same run in our biochemical laboratory of the Institute of Psychology at the University of Zurich. 6.1.4 Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed using S PSS (Version 19) statistical software package for Macintosh (IBM SPSS Statistics. Somers, NY, USA). The optimal sample size of 64 has been calculated a priori using the statistical software G*Power (Faul et al., 2007). Prior stress management research with cortisol stress responses reported effect sizes ranging from f2 = .28 - .35 (Gaab et al., 2003, Storch et al., 2007). The sample size was calculated to detect an expected medium to large effect size of f2 = .25 with a power .85 and = .05. Analyses of covariance and variance for repeated measures were computed to analyze endocrine responses between groups, controlling for differences in endocrine baseline levels when indicated. All reported results were corrected by the Greenhouse -Geisser procedure where appropriate (violation of sphericity assumption). Data were tested for normal distribution and homogeneity of variance using the Kolmogorov -Smirnov test and Levene 's test before statistical procedures we re applied. For all analyses, the significance level was = 5%. Unless indicated, all results are shown as means and standard deviations. 6.2 Results A total of 108 participants enrolled online on a website to participate in the study and com- pleted the screen ing questionnaire. Reasons for exclusion were: use of oral contraceptive (n=5), mental disorder ( n=2), over age of 55 n=11), knowledge of interevention ( n=6). A total of nine participants lost interest in participation before t hey were The IKSIT study 86 randomly assigned to one of the groups. The remaining 70 subjects ( N=70) were randomly assigned either to received intervention after participating in the TSST (Kirschbaum et al., 1993). 6.2.1 Descripti ve group characteristics Group characteristics collected and analyzed were age in years, gender, body mass index, education, sports activities hours per week and smoking habits (light smoking was defined as 5 cigarettes or less per day). The groups did not differ significantly in any of the descriptive characteristics (Table 10). Table 10: Demographic, group -related, and psychometric group characteristics of the 57 subjects under study who completed pre - and post -measurements and the Trier Social Stress T est (TSST) The IKSIT study 87 6.2.2 Psychometric group characteristics While the groups did not differ in the descriptive characteristics, we found significant differences in the pretreatment comparions of the psychometric characteristics of the groups. The depression scale ADS -K was significantly higher in the KIG . Psychometric characteristics of all participants at baseline Although n ot significant, but worth noting was that in 89.5% of all questionnaires the KIG exhibited health parameters that may be interpreted as inferior to the SMG and CG at base- line. In 10.5% this was the case for the CG, while the SMG always presented the most favorable means (Table 12). The IKSIT study 88 6.2.3 Primary and secondary outcomes 6.2.3.1 Endocrine stress response evaluation: Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) The endocrine stress response in the TSST resulted in a significant salivary free cortisol response (time effect: F (1.61/41.7 4, p < 0.001). ANCOVA (ADS -K post as covariate) showed that groups did not differ significantly in their baseline cortisol levels (group effect: F (2/53) = 0.343, p = .711), nor in their salivary free cortisol stress response over time (group by time inter action effect: F (2/53) = .295; p=.746).

While the KIG and the CG did not increase in well -being over time the SMG developed positively in several psychometric characteristics (Table 14 ). Table 14. Trainingeffects of the stress management group (SMG) over the examination period Over the observation period depressive affect and negative thought patterns assessed by the ADS -K diminished 25.6% ( p=.030) as well a s perceived stress, measured by the PSS, which decreased 13.9% ( p=.000) and the SRS, which assessed the experience of typical stress reactivity and changed 6.75% ( p=.000) compared to pre -training. Furthermore, the sense of coherence, the dynamic feeling of optimism and control regarding the future, measured with the SOC increased 4.9% ( p=.001) as well as perceived self -efficacy measured with SWE was found to be 3.7% elevated ( p=.050) and the self concept of own ability showed a positive trend ( p=.054) over time. Discussion 93 7 Discussion The primary purpose of this effectiveness study was to evaluate the effects of kinesiology and cognitive behavioral stress management on psychological well -being to an acute stressor in healthy women and men. Therefore, we performed a ran domized controlled effectiveness intervention study. A secondary goal was to review and promote a test procedure, which could be utilized for intervention studies in different methods of complementary medicine. At first sight the primary and secondary out come measures did not reveal notable information other that the three groups did not differ in them. However, as we immersed into the data we found that the relevance of the study lies in a methodological hindsight. However, we see three key findings: 1) T he study design has proved to be efficient and the participants in all three groups reacted to the TSST and it evoked comparable patterns in saliva cortisol. Although the participants in the three groups showed a stress response to the TSST we were unable to find relevant group differences. 2) At the outset of the study we allocated the participants by chance to prevent biases that could affect the course of the study. Although we performed adequate randomization the KIG exhibited meaningfully higher depres sion scores than both other groups. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that additional psychological characteristics that may influence coping with stress have not been evenly distributed already at baseline. 3) While the kinesiology and the control group did not differ in the course of the observation period, we found that in the psychometric components relevant for psychological health, the stress management group developed extraordinarily positive. However, this effect is observed only if the group is lo oked at separately. The first finding concerned the study design. Various psychological methods, but also such from complementary medicine claim to reduce psycho -social stress and promote well -being. Our study design has proved to be resource -efficient, reproducible and reliable to test such hypotheses. As in the predec essor studies (Gaab et al., 2003 ; Hammerfald et al., 2006; Storch et al., 2007) we were able to induce stress and measure the reactivity pattern in all groups. But Discussion 94 as the groups already dif fered substantially at outset of the study it cannot be ruled out that this might have confounded the results, thus comparing the treatment groups might be interpreted as futile. For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that we also see the skewnes s of distribution of psychometric variables and the participants variance in relation to the sample size which might have been too large compared to the effects as further explana- tion for not finding group differences in the TSST. For the SMG we found a di ssociation between emotional development over the evaluation period and the response during the TSST. When observed separately we found the participants of the stress management group developed favorably in all psychometric components but during the stress test the group performed similarly compared to the other two groups. Accord ing to Campbell and Ehlert (2012 ) this dissociation between cortisol responses and perceived emotional stress variables have been found in approximately 75% of the studies with TSS T. Therefore, the positive development during the experimental phase is not in conflict with the current literature but rather reflects a normal reactivity pattern and/or results from various methodological issues (Campbell & Ehlert, 2012 ). Due to the fore mentioned differences at outset of the study it is difficult to derive reliable assertions for the KIG from the results observed. It is conceivable that the training was too short to have substantial effect. Our treatment lasted two consecut ive days while Gaab et al. (2003 ) taught for two days with interval and active training time in between training -dates, while Storch et al. (2007) trained on two consecutive weekends (each 3 days) as well as a booster session. This resulting in over three times as much training time. But it is also cogitable that the kinesiology treatment compiled for healthy individuals did not focus enough on the relevant characteristics of the group treated and a treatment that would have focused more on the depressive affect would ha ve been better suited. And lastly it cannot be ruled out that the training as such was not effective towards developing resilience. As to the second key finding, the Swiss Federal Council (2013) urged in its \"Health 2020\" strategy to promote health by m eans of prevention to raise health competence and improve well-being in the healthy general public. It was therefore perspicuous that we utilized a pragmatic trial, a term coined by Schwartz and Lellouch (1967), to evaluate the two interven- tions as well as the control group. This trial form, also referred to as effectiveness study, ensures closeness to real -world practice (Singal et al., 2014), delivers higher external validity Discussion 95 and relevance for providers in practice and policy -makers to decide confidently. Irrespective of the trial form to utilize statistical theory random sampling is imperative. Only this can ensure that the compared groups do not differ in any systematic way at the outset (Altman & Bland, 1999). For this reason as well as the fact that we strictly followed the study design of our precursors (Gaab et al., 2003 ; Hammerfald et al., 2006; Storch et al., 2007) we chose the following allocation process: we blindly randomized each participant and to the best of our knowledge to one of the groups . As described earlier this procedure led to groups that differed meaningfully regarding the extent of depressive symptomatology. At pre -measurement the median depression score of the KIG was one standard deviation higher than the median of the SMG. In te rms of helpful characteristics towards stress management the kinesiology group exhibited baseline scores that were in 89.5% the least preferable of all three groups. Con- versely, the SMG demonstrated already at baseline in all psychometric characteristic as sociat- ed with favorable stress -coping the most preferable scores. This may be interpreted as supposition that the groups differed in their resources of managing stress already at the outset of the study. Our study used almost identical exclusion crite ria, but while Gaab et al. (2003 ) and Storch et al. (2007) recruited young male students only and Hammerfald et al. (2006) recruited both gender but second year psychology students only, our study recruited also healthy participants but more representative of t he general population with the age group being between 20 and 50 years old. We assume that in narrow, homogenous populations the variation is smaller and that this difference might have been the root cause that led to the different groups. Random assignmen t makes groups comparable only when the sample is large. Saint -Mont and Tu (2015) even argue that in small to medium sized samples random allocation of subjects to treatments yield considerable imbalance between the groups and that confounding due to rando mization is more the rule rather than the exception. Extended procedures have been suggested to keep the groups balanced for certain prognostic patient characteristics. These may be stratified randomization or minimization where group allocation does not r ely solely on chance but is designed to reduce any difference in the distribution of known or suspected determinants of outcome, so that any effect can be attributed to the treatment under test (Altman & Bland, 1999). At the beginning of the trial it is de termined which factors need to be represented equally in the groups. Then group allocation is made, but not purely by chance, but by determining in which group inclusion the person would mini-Discussion 96 mize any differences in these predefined factors (Treasure & MacR ae, 1998). Thus, if group A has higher depression scores as well as higher age, but other variables being equal, the next elderly with higher depression scores is likely to be allocated to group B. The allocation process may then still involve chance with a blinded individual but \"with the dice loaded\" in favor of the allocation which minimizes the differences (Treasure & MacRae, 1998). We propose for future pragmatic studies in the norm population to at least stratify or minimize for the most prevalent di sorders such as depression, anxiety and stress. This could help ensure, rather than hope for, that groups are going to be comparable. Thirdly and finally, we report the training effects of the stress -management group over the course of the observation per iod. In the post measurement we found that all psychometric components relevant for psychological health had developed in the preferable direction. In the following characteristics the development over the observation period was especially evident: a) we found the group less depressive, with less negative thoughts as well as less stressed and b) the participants exhibited a stronger self -concept, higher self -efficacy as well as an improved sense of coherence. In summary, the stress management group became more resilient. As the groups were comparable in all but the psychometric characteristics, where the depression scores protrude, we hypothesize that this difference as well as the training might have led to the positive development of the group. The eviden ce also converges as the encumbering psychometric variables diminished while parallel the health supporting ones flourished. This leads us to the supposition that the responsiveness to a prevention program might be influenced by psychological condition as well as the coping resources of the individual at outset of the training program. We conceive this as a potential psychological \"trampoline effect\". Therefore, the stress coping resources at the start of the program could be seen as moderator that affects the strength of the relationship between the content of the program and the responsiveness to it. To follow the above mentioned analogy, the weight of the object could be seen as the content of the program which is equal for every participant, but the resi lience -effect accruing originates from the interaction of the individuals' resources with it. This could imply that more developed coping skills at outset of the training could be acting as \"springs with more energy stored\" and therefore enabling in depth change, while partici- pants with elevated depression scores might have \"more rigid springs\" and therefore might be Discussion 97 less able to profit from the stress management program. It could be hypothesized that the latter could profit at first more from a different t raining program specifically addressing the depressive symptomatology to become more receptive for the following stress management training. This program could focus on symptoms associated with depression such as loss of interest, decreased energy, low moo d, poor concentration or pessimism. Subsequent the stress management program could be taught and be more effective. However, there are limitations to our study. Firstly, the number of participants was relatively small and due to nature of an effectivenes s study the variance found was large. It is therefore possible that the sample size was too small in order to find the expected differences. Second- ly, due to the higher depression scores of the kinesiology group we cannot derive reliable assertions regardi ng the effectiveness for stress management of the kinesiology training. It might be assumed that the overall psychometric scores of the more depressed participants considerably inhibited h ypothesized changes over time. Finally, based on this study we str ongly suggest that in future effectiveness studies more elaborated allocation methods are used in order to balance the potential key influence factors. While elaborated randomization has been a complex task in the past, the use of software programs will ma ke enhanced randomization processes much easier to implement. This will make the use of resources in research more effectively. Furthermore, we suggest to utilize the proposed research protocol for evaluation of complementary medicine methods that claim th at their method is useful to strengthening resources against acute stress. And last but not least, we encourage future studies to elaborate in more detail the evidence that the effect of stress management training with people that are resourceful already a t the beginning of the training can lead to outstanding positive development of resilience. A potential psychological trampo- line effect would have important implications for the use of stress management and other psychological health trainings in the futur e. 98 Conflict of interest The author declares that there have been no conlicts of interest.
