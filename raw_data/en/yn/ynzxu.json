At travel consultation appointments, our providers will review your destination country and offer recommendations for medications and vaccinations, precautions to prevent illness while abroad, and review general health related packing list items. This travel consultation service is available to students of all destinations (low risk and high risk), as well as those students with health issues, or for students that have questions regarding travel outside the United States pertaining to their best health. If you are traveling with a Vanderbilt sponsored group and are not comfortable signing the [VU Office of Global Safety required self-disclosure form](https://www.vumc.org/student-health/sites/default/files/Office%20of%20Global%20Health%20Student%20Health%20Disclosure%20for%20International%20Travel%20-2023.pdf), we strongly encourage you to make an appointment. There is no office visit fee. Travel consultation appointments should be made 4-6 weeks in advance of the departure date, in order to allow any needed vaccines time to take effect. Some vaccines may require a series of shots, so it is important to allow enough time for series completion. Preparing for a travel consultation in advance will allow your visit to be more efficient and productive. The CDC's travel website at [www.cdc.gov/travel](http://www.cdc.gov/travel) is a helpful resource that will give you an idea of what to expect at your appointment. You should also inform the SHC provider with a detailed itinerary of destinations and activities. Vaccines- The SHC carries all routine vaccinations as well as most travel-related vaccines, including Japanese Encephalitis, Rabies and Yellow Fever vaccines. Students on the AHP Student Health Insurance will find that most of their immunizations and travel medications are either fully covered or available for a minimal co-pay. Students with private insurance will be given a discounted rate for travel vaccines and medications.
