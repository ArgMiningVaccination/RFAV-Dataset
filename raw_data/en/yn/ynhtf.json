Introduction 1. Turmeric is a commonly used culinary spice. For centuries, turmeric has been widely used for imparting colour and flavour to food, and in Indian and Chinese traditional medicine as a remedy for the treatment of inflammation and other diseases (Ammon & Wahl 1991). 2. Many of the pharma cological properties of turmeric have been attributed to curcumin . These properties include antioxidant, analgesic, al. 2015). is a polyphenol compound naturally present within turmeric rhizomes. Its derivatives demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin are also present within turmeric rhizomes. These compounds are collectively called \"curcum inoids \" 3. Due to its purported health benefits, the consumption of curcumin/turmeric supplements is increasingly popular. However, in recent months there has been an increase in numbers for reports of hepatotoxicity linked to the consumption of curcumin supp lements. 4. Curcumin (E 100) is a dicinnamoylmethane dye authorised as a food additive in the EU . It has been evaluated by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) and the European Food Safety Autho rity (EFSA). An Acceptable Daily Intake ( ADI) of 3mg/kg bw/d had been established by JECFA in 2004 based on a reproductive toxicity study and this was re -confirmed in the evaluation by EFSA in 201 0. 5. The FSA's Novel Foods Team consider turmeric food supple ments comprising of turmeric oleoresin extract1 or pure curcumin powder to be novel. These products were not significantly used as a food or food ingredient before 15th of May 1997. Therefore, before these products may be placed on the market in the EU as a food supplement, a safety assessment under the Novel Food Regulation is required. 6. Supplement intake leads to exposures that are several magnitudes higher than the ADI. Furthermore, synthetic forms of turmeric and curcumin or 1 Turmeric powder extracted with organic solvents. This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 4 conjugation with other chemi cals such as piperine are used to increase absorption, thus altering its toxicokinetic profile. 7. Between December 2018 and 20th July 2019, a total of 21 individual cases of acute cholestatic hepatitis \"likely to be linked to the consumption of food supplem ents based on curcumin and piperine\" were reported on Italian territory . Italy's National Institute of Health the interdisciplinary group, section dietetics, and the technical committee for animal nutrition and health concluded that, to date, the causes ar e likely to be related to individual susceptibility, pre -existing alterations, latent hepato -biliary function or even the use of drugs\". The Institute adopted a warning for the labelling of the supplements in question (to take effect from 31st December 201 9), advising against their use for subjects with altered hepato -biliary function, and recommending medical advice when other medications are being taken Background 8. Turmeric is the common name for the rhizome (underground stem) of Curcuma longa L., a perennial herb cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. India is the largest producer of turmeric, supplying over 90 % of the world's demand (Olojede et al. 2009). There are about 70 varieties of C. longa cultivated in India (Sasikumar 2005). For centuries, turmeric has been widely used for imparting colour and flavour to food, and in Indian and Chinese traditional medicine as a remedy for the treatment of inflammation and other diseases (Ammon & Wahl 1991). 9. Curcumin (E 100) is a dicinnamoylmethane dye authorised as a food additive in the EU for use in beverages and foodstuffs according to the European Parliament and Council Directive 94/36/EC2. It has been evaluated by the JECFA, SCF and EFSA. An ADI of 3 mg/kg bw/d had been established based on a reproductive toxicity study by JECFA in 2004 and was re- confirmed in the evaluation by EFSA in 2010. 10. The consumption of turmeric and/or curcumin either raw, powdered or in supplement form has become increasingly popular due to the purported health benefits. 11. Intake of some supplements leads to exposures that are several magnitudes higher than the ADI. Naturally curcumin has low oral bioavailability, due to its hydrophobic nature. However, in supplements, synthetic forms of curcumin and conjugation with other chemicals such as piperine are used to increase absorption, thus altering its toxicokinetic profile. 12. Contamination of turmeric has been a health and safety issue in the past. Contamination with lead is a result of either turmeric grown on lead rich soil or intentional adulteration with lead chromate. Often lead chromate, a lead-based colour, is used to enhance the appearance of turmeric. As a result, raw or ground turmeric could potentially contain high levels of lead. Turmeric powder can be adulterated with powders of other species of 2 OJ L 273, 10.9.94, p.13 5 This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final view s of the Committee and should not be cited. Curcuma (Reyma et al. 2004) which may be toxic. For example, the powde r of Curcuma zedoaria , a common adulteran kno wn to be toxic; the high-prote in flour o f C. zedoaria caused 100 % mortality with in 6 days when given a t 320 g/kg diet to 5 week-old rats (La tif et al. 1979). 13. In supplements, a number o f reported cases involved adulteration with nimesulide , a nonsteroidal anti-inflammato ry drug known to cause liver problems. Supplements and reported hepatotoxicity 14. Between December 2018 and 20th July 2019, a total of 21 individual cases of acute cholestatic hepatitis \"likely to be linked to the consumption of food supplements based on curcumin and piperine\" were reported on Italian territory. A total o f 18 turmeric supplements have been associated with t he outbreak . 3. A total of 18 turmeric supplements have been associated with this hepatitis outbreak, one of which (\"Curcuma Liposomal & black pepper\" by Nutrimea) was recalled by Belgium's Federal Agenc y for Food Chain Safety (AFSCA) 4. 15. Whilst the AFSCA said that \"the exact source of contamination had not yet been established\", an update from Italy's National Institute of Health indicated that \"the interdisciplinary group, section dietetics, and the tec hnical committee for animal nutrition and health concluded that, to date, the causes are likely to be related to individual susceptibility, pre -existing alterations, latent hepato -biliary function or even the use of drugs\". The Institute adopted a warning for the labelling of the supplements in question (to take effect from 31st December 2019), advising against their use for subjects with altered hepato -biliary function, and recommending medical advice when other medications are being taken. The Institute a dded that for turmeric powder, which was implicated in one hepatitis case, no particular recommendations were needed especially considering its history of consumption as a food. 16. The Food Standards Agency has been monitoring incidents related to consumption of raw and powdered turmeric and its supplements. In light of the new outbreaks and due to the uncertainties surrounding the composition and possible contamination of these commodities, the Committee on Toxicity (COT) has been asked to comment on the risk to human health from turmeric and curcumin in their various forms. Toxicokinetics 17. In both humans and animals curcumin, hereafter referred to as diferuloylmethane , has been shown to have low This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 6 18. Approximately 75% of the administered d ose was excretes in the faeces with negligible amounts appearing in the urine following oral administration of 1g/kg bw of curcumin in rats (Wahlstrom & Blennow 1978). Oral bioavailability is similarly low in humans, due to poor absorption and extensive f irst-pass metabolism in the intestine and liver (Ireson et al. 2001, 2002). 19. Numerous studies have evaluated the level of curcumin after administration and found that either no curcumin or its metabolites, or only low levels, were detected in serum or tissu e (Shen and Ji, 2012). Ravindranath & Chandrasekhara (1981) evaluated the tissue distribution of \"curcumin\" using tritium -labelled drug in male Wistar rats. They found that radioactivity was detectable in blood, liver, and kidney following doses of 10, 80, or 400 mg of [3H]curcumin. With 400 mg, considerable amounts of radiolabelled products were present in tissues 12 days after dosing. The percentage of curcumin absorbed (60 -66 % of the given dose) remained constant regardless of the dose indicating that a dministration of more curcumin does not result in higher absorption. Shoba et al. (1998) orally administered 2 g/kg bw curcumi n to rats and reported the absorption and elimination half -lives to be 0.31 \u00b1 0.07 and 1.7 \u00b1 0.5 hours, respectively. 20. In humans, the same dose of curcumin did not allow the calculation of these half -life values because the serum curcumin levels were below the detection limit at most of the time points in most of the experimental subjects . 21. In supplements, however, it is common practi ce to alter curcumin metabolism to enhance its bioavailability. This can be achieved with methods such as the use of liposomal curcumin, curcumin nanoparticles, the use of curcu min phospholipid complex and the use of structural analog ues of curcumin that a re water soluble. The use of adjuvants that interfere with glucuronidation is also popular. For example, piperine, the major active ingredient in black pe pper, has been shown to increase the bioavailability of curcumin by up to 2000% (Hewlings & Kalman, 20 17). Toxicity Derivation of a Health Based Guidance Value 22. In 1975, the SCF evaluated curcumin. No ADI was set by SCF as they considered that curcumin (from natural foods) could be classified as colour for which an ADI could not be established but which i s nevertheless acceptable for use in food. 23. In 199 6, JECFA evaluated the results of toxicology and carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice administered turmeric oleoresin containing 79 -85 % curcuminoids (NTP 1993). After 15 months of treatment, absolute an d relative liver weights were increased in both male and female mice in the mid - and highest -dose groups relative to controls. The No Observed Adverse Effect Level ( NOAEL) for liver enlargement was 2000 mg/kg in the diet, equal to 220This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 7 mg/kg bw/ day. On the basis of the NO AEL of 220 mg/kg bw/day in the carcinogenicity study of mice and a safety factor of 200, JECFA increased the temporary ADI to 0 -1 mg/ kg bw and extended it, pending the submission of the results of a reproductive toxicity study with curcumi n (JECFA , 1996). 24. In 2004, JECFA noted that the turmeric oleoresin used in the NTP (1993) study did not comply with the current specification for curcumin. JECFA withdrew the temporary ADI and established an ADI for curcumin of 0 - 3 mg/kg bw based on signif icant decreases in the average bodyweights of Wistar rat F2 generation pups (JECFA 2004). 25. In 2010, EFSA concluded that the present database support ed an ADI of 3 mg/kg bw/day, also based on significant decreases in the average bodyweights of Wistar rat F2 generation pups (EFSA 2010). Wistar rats were fed diets containing diferuloylmethane (> 90 % purity) at doses equal to 0, 130-140 , 250-290 and 850-960 mg/kg 1000-1100 mg/kg bw/day in females . The total period of treatmen t was 21 weeks for the parenta l generation and 24 weeks for the F1 generation . No treatment-related clinica l sign s of toxici ty during the study were reported. 26. Significan t decreases in the average weights of the F2 generation pups were observed a t days 1 and 7 at the intermediate dose , and on days 7 , 14 and 21 a t the high dose . These decreases represented < 10 % of the average weigh t of the concurren t controls and were reported to be within the range of the historical control data . There were no other effec ts on general health, body weight, pup survival or fertili ty indices in either generation . JECFA considered the effec t on pup weight seen a t the intermediate dose (equal to 250-320 mg/kg bw/day) to be incidenta l and therefore a NOEL. JECFA allocated an ADI for curcum in of 0-3 mg/kg bw/day based on the application of an uncertain ty factor of 100 to this NOEL (JECFA 2004). 27. EFSA also reported human studies where volunteers were exposed to relatively high doses of curcumin either via single dose or for a few months. Based on the results, for dose levels up to 12 000 mg/day, only short-term and semi-chronic adve rse effects, such as gastrointestinal effects, headache and rash were observed, but without clear dose-relationship. Hepatitis 28. Hepatitis is the general term for inflammation o f the liver. Th is has a range o f clinical presentations varying in duration, severity and eventual outcome . The initial symptoms of hepatitis are often non-specific bu t in the later stage s of the disease the symptoms refle ct impairmen t of various liver function s. Laborato ry evidence of liver cell damage can often be detected in asymptoma tic patien ts bu t significant impact on the synthetic, metabolic and excretory functions of the liver eventually leads to symptoms such as bruising secondary to lack of clotting factors, encephalopathy caused by failure to conve rt ammon ia to urea, and itching when bile salts are deposited in the skin instead of being eliminated in the bile . The liver ha s a remarkable ability to regenerate after damage but often fails to replicate the original complexThis is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 8 cellular architecture necessary for normal function and instead produces cirrhosis, a combination of fibrous tissue and regenerative nodules. 29. In the UK , the most common causes of liver injury are fa tty infiltration of the liver or viral infection, but toxicants (including alcohol), genetic storage disease and autoimmune processes can also lead to liver damage. In a proportion of patients, no ready explanation can be found for liver damage however sev ere. Toxicant -induced hepatitis, usually caused by drugs, is common and often resolves when the relevant chemical exposure ceases. In some cases, however, cellular da mage is severe and the outcome can be fatal. 30. Identifying a cause for an episode of hepat itis depends upon a history of exposure to chemicals, drugs or contact with sources of hepatitis infection, together with laboratory investigations. Infection with many of the hepatitic viruses can be identified either by demonstrating an antigenic part of the virus or a specific antibody response to the virus in the blood. Autoimmune disease can be diagnosed from the pattern of antibodies to specific cellular components such as mitochondria and from the clinical picture of other organ involvement. Damaged liver cells tend to leak enzymes into the blood and some clue as to the site of greatest damage within the liver can be gleaned from the pattern of enzymes in the blood, with transaminases, particularly alanine aminotransferase (ALT), being released from d amaged parenchymal cells and alkaline phosphatase being released from cells lining the bile ducts. Morphology of hepatitis 31. The morphological appearances of different types of hepatitis are often similar (Ferrell, 2001). Pathological features of acute h epatitis include swelling and ballooning of hepatocytes and cell death affecting single cells, groups of cells adjacent to portal tracts, or extensive confluent areas. Kupffer cells are actively phagocytic and within the portal tracts there are increased n umbers of chronic inflammatory cells. There may also be increased numbers of inflammatory cells in the hepatic parenchyma. 32. The defining feature of active chronic hepatitis is infiltration of lymphocytes from portal tracts with associated death of liver c ells, so called interface hepatitis. This in time is associated with fibrosis. Sometimes the amount of inflammation is less and a biopsy fails to show interface hepatitis. The presence of plasma cells or discrete lymphoid aggregates may suggest the possibi lity of a viral cause. Some storage disorders, for example Wilson's disease and copper accumulation, and alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency, show morphological evidence of a chronic active hepatitis. Idiosyncratic drug hepatotoxicity 33. Idiosyncrat ic drug hepatotoxici ty (IDH) occurs in1/500 to 1/50,000 individua ls exposed to a particular drug (the prevalence of idiopath ic hepatitis in the community is estimated to be 1/100,000) (Kap lowitz, 2005). IDH has9 This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final view s of the Committee and should not be cited. been associated with a variety of pharmaceutical drug s as well as food supplements, notably kava kava. IDH is generally too rare to be detected in clinical trials, though elevated ALT leve ls may be an indicator. As a general rule, an ALT level greater than three times the upper level o f normal is considered to be a sensitive indicator o f liver toxici ty (the marker is not completely specific since muscle inju ry may elevate ALT levels) . While this is nearly universally described for idiosyncratic liver toxicants, it is not always predictive o f overt idiosyncratic toxicity. 34. Two types of IDH occur. Allergic IDH occurs with a short laten t period and involves the adaptive immune system. Symptoms may include , fever, rash or eosinophilia. Non-allergic IDH has none of the above feature s. There is a long latency period , where there may have been months of normal liver function test results prior to the occurrence of IDH. Turmeric and hepatotoxicity Animal studies Subacute toxicity Rats 35. Liju et al. (2013) investigated the acute and sub-chronic toxici ty of turmeric essential oil (TEO ) from Curcuma longa L . Acute administration of TEO was done as a sing le oral dose o f up to 5 g/kg bw, and a 13-wee k sub- chronic toxici ty study was done a t dose s of 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 g/kg bw/day in Wistar rats. There were no mortalities , adverse clinical sign s or changes in body weight , wate r and food consumption during the acute and sub-chronic studies. Indicato rs of hepa tic function such aminotransferase (AST) , ALT and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were unchanged in treated animals compared to untreated animals. O ral administration of TEO for 13 weeks did not alter total cholesterol, triglyceride s, ma rkers of renal function, serum electrolyte parameters and histopathology of tissues. Mice 36. Dietary turmeric powder (0.2 %, 1.0 %, 5.0 % , equivalen t to 400, 2000, 10000 mg/kg bw/day) or ethanolic turmeric extra ct (ETE, 0.05 %, 0.25 %, equivalen t to 100, 5 00 mg/kg bw/day) for 14 da ys, at doses reported to be cancer preventive in model systems , were found to be hepatotoxic in mice. The diferuloylmethane contents o f the turmeric powder and ETE were not reported . Exposure of mice to dietary turmeric or ETE d id no t have any significant effect on body weight/ liver weigh t or liver to body weigh t ratios. Animals exposed to 0.2 % turmeric showed coagulative necrosis in liver. Liver s from mice receiving 1.0 % and 5.0 % turmeric showed extreme degenerative change s with necrosis. Coagulative necrotic foci surrounded by a zone of regeneration were also evident. Similar changes were also seen in animals treated with 0.05 % and 0.25 % ETE. Necrotic changes in liver, the10 This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final view s of the Committee and should not be cited. principal effect, was seen in 6/6 animals from 5.0 % turmeri c, 3/6 from 1.0 % turmeric and 3/6 animals from 0.2 % turmeric. Similarly, 3/6 anima ls from 0.05 % as well as 0.25 % ETE a lso showed these alteration s. Liver from mice receiving control die t showed normal ultrastructu re. In the liver o f the animals receiving 5.0 % or 1.0 % turmeric diet or 0.25 % or 0.05 % ETE, some o f the parenchymal cells had round nuclei consisting of clumped or densely marginated chromatin s pleomorphic vacuolated mitochondr ia filled with dense bodies, surrounded by rough or smooth endoplasmic reticulum and free ribosomes, and an increased number of glycogen particles and Golgi complexes with vesicles. (Kandarkar et al. 1998). Sub-chronic toxicity Mice 37. Sub-chronic oral toxicity of turmeric and ETE was studied in female Swiss mice and Wistar rats fed turmeric powder (0, 1 and 5 %) and ethanolic turmeric extract (0, 0.05 and 0.25 %) t hrough the diet for 14 and/or 90 days. The curcuminoid content of the ETE was approximately 98%. The administration of a high dose of turmeric (5 %) for longer duration (90 days) showed a significant reduction in body weight gain, alterations in absolute and/ or relative liver weights, and hepatotoxicity i.e. focal necrosis or focal necrosis with regeneration both in mice and rats. In mice, lower doses of turmeric (i.e. 0.2 or 1 % for 14 days) also showed hepatotoxicity and they were found to be more vulner able to turmeric -induced hepatotoxicity than rats. (Deshpande et al. 1998). 38. In a 13 week study, groups of 10 male and 10 female B6C3F 1 mice were fed diets containing 0, 1000, 5000, 10000, 25000, or 50000 ppm turmeric oleoresin , which were estimated to del iver average daily doses of 150, 750, 1700, 3850, or 7700 mg /kg bw to males and 200, 1000, 1800, 4700 or 9300 mg/kg bw to females (NTP 1993). The major component of the oleoresin was identified as diferuloylmethane (79 to 85 %). The percent composition was monitored periodically at the study laboratory with free -acid titration and high -performance liquid chromatography methods, and no change in composition was observed. There were no deaths attributed to turmeric oleoresin and the final mean body weight gai ns and final mean body weights of all exposed groups of male and female mice were similar to those of the controls. Feed consumption by exposed male and female mice was similar to that by the controls. Absolute and relative liver weights of male mice that received 5000 ppm and male and female mice that received 10000, 25000 and 50000 ppm were significantly greater than those of the controls. Clinical findings in mice included stained fur, and discoloured faeces and urine. According to NTP, t here were no bio logically significant differences in hematologic, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis parameters, and there were no chemical related histopathologic lesions . EFSA (2010) concluded that the no - effect level with respect to gross and microscopic pathological ch anges was 7700 and 9280 mg/kg bw/day in males and females, respectively, which were the highest doses tested.This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 11 Rats 39. In a 28 day study, diferuloylmethane (purity > 98 %) was administered to Sprague Dawley rats through the diet at dose levels of 26.1, 84.8, 224,8, 459.7 and 1117.8 mg/kg bw/day. Clinical chemistry did not reveal major signs of liver damage associated with administration of diferuloylmethane . cDNA microarray experiments were performed on hepatic RNA. Diferuloylmethane altered the expression of 12 genes. Three of these were related to peroxisomes (phytanoyl oxidation was observed. The authors concluded that these data suggest that diferuloylmethane is a wea k peroxisome proliferator in rats. (Stierum et al. 2008). 40. In a 13 week study, groups of 10 male and 10 female F344/N rats were fed diets containing 0, 1000, 5000, 10000, 25000, or 50000 ppm turmeric oleoresin (79 to 85 % diferuloylmethane) , estimated to d eliver average daily doses of 50, 250, 480, 1300, or 2600 mg/kg bw to males and 60, 300, 550, 1450, or 2800 mg/kg bw to females. All rats survived until the end of the study. The final mean body weight of males receiving 50000 ppm was 5 % lower than that o f the controls. Feed consumption by exposed male and female rats was similar to that of controls. The absolute and relative liver weights of female rats and the relative liver weights of male rats receiving 5000, 10000, 25000, and 50000 ppm were significan tly greater than those of the controls. According to NTP, these increases may have been due to mild hepatocellular swelling or hypertrophy. In the clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and other hematologic parameters, no differences were observed that were cons idered by the NTP to be biologically significant. Clinical findings included stained fur, and discoloured faeces and urine of exposed animals . Mild to moderate hyperplasia of the mucosal epithelium was observed in the cecum and colon of male and female rat s that received 50000 ppm. (NTP 1993). 41. A six month toxicity study of curcuminoids extracted from the powdered dried rhizome of Curcuma longa was performed in six groups of 15 Wistar rats of each sex. The extract was reported to contain 58 -67 % curcuminoi ds. The water control group received 5 ml of water/kg bw/day, while the tragacanth control group received 5 ml of 0.5 % tragacanth suspension/ kg bw/day orally. Three treatment groups were given the suspension of curcuminoids powder at doses of 10, 50 and 250 mg/kg bw/day. The fourth treatment group, or the recovery group, also received 250 mg/kg bw/day of curcuminoids for six months, but two weeks of no curcuminoids treatment elapsed before the time of sacrifice. It was found that the growth rate of male r ats receiving curcuminoids at 50 mg/kg bw/day was significantly higher than that of the tragacanth control group. Curcuminoids did not produce any significant dose - related changes of haematological parameters. In the group of male animals receiving 250 mg/ kg bw/day of curcuminoids, actual and relative liver weights and the level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were significantly higher than those of the two controls, but the ALP level was still within a normal range. There appeared to be a higher incidence of mild degree of liver fatty degeneration and adrenocortical fatty degeneration in this group of animals,12 This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final view s of the Committee and should not be cited. however the incidence was not significantly differen t from that of the two controls. The authors concluded that at higher doses , curcum in may affect the function and morphology o f the liver in a reversib le manner. The EFSA Panel concluded that due to the lack of knowledge on the diferuloylmethane content and nature o f the extract tested , the study cou ld not be used to assess the safety of diferuloylmethane. (Chavalittumrong et al. 2002). Chronic toxicity 2-year study in rats 42. Groups of 60 male and 60 female F344/N rats were fed diets containing 2000, 10000, or 50000 ppm turmeric oleoresin (79 to 85 % diferuloylmethane ) for 104 (males) or 103 (females) week s, which were estimated to deliver average daily doses of 80, 460, or 2000 mg/kg bw to males and 90, 440, or 2400 mg/kg bw to females. Nine or 10 rats from each exposure group were evaluated after 15 months. Survival of exposed male and female rats was sim ilar to that of the controls. The final mean body weights of all exposed male rats and female rats receiving 2000 and 10000 ppm were similar to those of the controls. The final mean body weights of male and female rats that received 50000 ppm were slightly lower ( up to 10 %) than those of the controls throughout much of the study. Feed consumption by exposed male and female rats was similar to that by controls throughout the study. The absolute and relative liver weights of female rats receiving 10000 or 50 000 ppm were significantly greater than those of controls at the 15 -month interim evaluation. There were no clinical findings related to toxicity. In male and female rats receiving 50000 ppm the haematocrit values, haemoglobin concentrations and erythrocyt e counts at the 15-month interim evaluation were significantly lower than those in the controls. In addition , platelet counts in male and female rats that received 50000 ppm and reticulocyte counts in male rats tha t received 50000 ppm were significantly higher than those in the controls. No biologically significant differences were observed in clinical chemistry parameters. (NTP 1993). 2-year study in mice 43. Group s of 60 ma le and 60 female B6C3F 1 mice were fed diets containing 2000 , 10000 , or 50000 ppm turmeric oleoresin (79 to 85 % diferuloylmethane) fo r 103 weeks, which were estimated to deliver average daily doses of 220, 520 , or 6000 mg/kg b w to males and 320, 1620, or 8400 mg/kg bw to females (NTP 1993). Nine o r ten mice from each exposure group were evaluated after 15 months. Survival o f exposed male and female mice was similar to that of the controls (male : 0 ppm, 43/50 ; 42/50). body weight of fema le mice receiving 50000 ppm was slightly lower (up to 12 %) than that of the controls from abou t week 25 . The final mean body weigh ts of male s tha t received 50000 ppm and females that received 10000 and 50000 ppm were significantly lower than those of controls . The final mean body weights o f othe r exposed groups o f male and female mice were similar to those o f the controls. Feed consumption by exposed male and fema le mice was similar to that by the controls throughou t the study. TheThis is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 13 absolute and relative liver weights of mal e and female mice receiving 10000 and 50000 ppm were significantly greater than those of the controls at the 15 - month interim evaluation. There were no clinical findings related to toxicity. No biologically significant differences were observed in hematolo gic parameters. The alkaline phosphatase values of male and female mice that received 10000 and 50000 ppm were significantly higher than those of controls at the 15-month interim evaluation. The incidences of hepatocellular adenoma in male and female mice receiving 10000 ppm (the mid dose group) , but not those in mice receiving 2000 or 50000 mice in the 10000 and 50000 ppm gr oups with multiple hepatocellular neoplasms compared with controls was of statistical significance. However, JECFA concluded that this effect was not dose -related and that curcumin is not a carcinogen (JECFA 199 6). In addition, the EFSA Panel noted that al l statistically significant effects noted by the NTP refer to benign neoplastic lesions (adenomas) (EFSA 2010) . The EFSA Panel noted that the effects observed were not dose -dependent, were in line with historical control values and were not consistent acro ss sexes and/or species. The Panel noted moreover that hepatocellular tumours occurring in untreated and treated B6C3F 1 mice are not relevant for humans. Therefore , the Panel agreed with JECFA that curcumin is not carcinogenic. Case studies in humans 44. In addition to the reported cases in Italy, several cases of liver toxicity associated with curcumin supplements intake have been reported in the literature. 45. In Australia, a 52 year old woman presented to her general practitioner with a one -week history o f nausea, pruritus, and painless jaundice with associated pale stools and dark urine. This occurred approximately one month following commencement of one tablet per day of Ancient Wisdom Modern Medicine High Potency Turmeric (375 mg curcuminoids and 4 mg black pepper per tablet), along with a flaxseed oil supplement and occasional diclofenac use for arthritic pain. ( N.B. this supplement leads to an intake of 204.6 % of the ADI of 3 mg/kg bw/day, see Table 5). She had no prior history of liver disease and ha d normal liver function tests (LFTs) three months before. Her medical history was notable only for oligoarticular osteoarthritis . 46. Upon admission, all oral medications and supplements were ceased. She was found to have a bilirubin of 162 mol/L with a hepatocellular profile on liver function tests (ALT U/L, U/L, U/L). With progressive jaundice over the subsequent days she was referred to the emergency department, at which point her bilirubin peaked a t 536 mol/L. 47. Due to lack of significant improvement by day four of admission, a liver biopsy was performed. Histology showed nonspecific inflammatory changes with generally preserved hepatic architecture and no fibrosis. She wasThis is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 14 discharged day 12 of adm ission (bilirubin 260 mol/L, ALT 1232 U/L) with the presumptive diagnosis of diclofenac induced liver injury. By two months after admission her liver function tests had normalised (bilirubin 21 mol/L, ALT 33 U/L) and she was discharged from the clinic. At this point she recommenced the turmeric supplement (1125 mg curcuminoids per day) as sole therapy for her arthritis. Three weeks later her nausea recurred and repeat liver function tests showed an acute hepatitis (ALT 2093 U/L, AST 1030 U/L, and biliru bin 60 mol/L). She was advised to cease the turmeric supplement, and two months later her liver function tests had again normalised. The turmeric supplements were sent for analysis by a validated liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method. Results were co mpared to a toxicology library containing approximately 1400 compounds, including medications, illicit drugs, and over -the-counter medicines. A further sample was analysed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for the presence of trace elements. The turmeric supplement tested negative for drugs, adulterants and toxic heavy metals. (Luber et al. 2019 ). 48. A 55 year old man was found to have an asymptomatic transaminitis at a routine check -up. His background history included idiopathic thrombocyto penic purpura, hypertension, gout, and osteoarthritis, with regular medications including long -term telmisartan, atenolol, and lercanidipine. He had no known liver history with normal liver function tests one year prior. His only new medication was commenc ement of a turmeric supplement five months prior to testing. He was referred to a hepatologist and underwent a screen for causes of acute hepatitis. Abdominal ultrasonography showed diffuse steatosis. A drug reaction was suspected, and the turmeric supple ment was ceased. Follow -ups occurred over the subsequent four months. Near normalisation of liver function tests occurred by one month (ALT 96 U/L, bilirubin 10 mol/L) with further improvement by four months after cessation (ALT 46 U/L, bilirubin 11 mol/L). The turmeric supplement was the presumed cause of the hepatitis. The turmeric supplement was not known, thus further analysis on it could not be performed and thus dose information is unknown . (Luber et al. 2019 ) 49. In the US, a 61 year old female with polycystic liver disease presented with fatigue, dark urine and polyarthralgias for one week. She denied alcohol use. Physical examination demonstrated right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness. Laboratory findings were notable for with a direct component of 1 mg/dL. Hepatic synthetic function was intact. Medications included naproxen and ergocalciferol (vitamin D) with n o changes four years prior to the onset of transaminitis. Viral infections were ruled out. Autoimmune work -up yielded positive antinuclear antibody (1:250) with normal anti -smooth muscle antibody and serum IgG levels. Abdominal Doppler was negative for por tal or hepatic vein thrombosis. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography did not show any biliary ductal pathology. It was discovered that the patient was taking turmeric supplements for 6 months. A liver biopsy demonstrated panlobular hepatitis with ea rly parenchymal collapse suggestive of a morphologicThis is a draft statement for discussion.

The p atient was thought to have drug-induced liver injury from turmeric pills that were discontinued and she was discharged with predn isone. Her LFTs normalized after 3 weeks, after which, her prednisone was tapered off. 50. Suhail et al. (2019) noted that the temporal association of liver injury in the patient, normalisation of LFTs upon withdrawal and improvement with steroids implicate t he turmeric supplement as the likely causative agent of liver injury. The Roussel -Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) scale, which attempts to codify causality of drug toxicity into objective criteria, was eight in our patient indicating a probable a dverse drug reaction. A negative serological workup and normalisation of LFTs following the discontinuation of steroids further solidify this conclusion. 51. In another case in the US reported by Lukefahr et al. (2018), a 71 year old woman was found to have a n asymptomatic transaminitis at routine check -up. Her medical history included hypothyroidism, Raynaud's syndrome, osteoarthritis, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, irritable bowel syndrome, and diverticulosis, with regular medications including amlodipine, met oprolol, and atenolol. A 'low cost' turmeric supplement (of unknown product identification) was taken according to label recommendations for a period of 8 months prior to transaminitis testing. The patient was referred to a gastroenterologist. Laboratory a nd biopsy findings led to a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis. Treatment was limited to withdrawing use of turmeric supplements. AST and ALT decreased significantly within 30 days of discontinuation and normalised by 13 months. In this case, the patient (n ot the clinicians) hypothesised that the turmeric may have been the cause of the elevated liver transaminases and elected to cease its use. 52. Subsequent reassessment of the liver biopsy by the authors revealed auto-fluorescent inclusions in the pigment -laden histiocytes, with an consistent with curcumin, or possibly lipofuscin. Histiocyte fluorescence, which was not noted in liver biopsy specimens from patients with unrelated disorders, was quenchable by treatment with Sudan Black B (SBB) , as has been reported for lipofuscin. However, because the authors also documented complete SBB quenching of curcumin autofluorescence in fixed cultured cells specifically loaded with curcuminoids, the authors could not ascertain with certainty whether the histiocyte inclusions here were composed of lipofuscin, a lysosomal degradation product and/or curcuminoids derived from the turmeric supplement that the patient was still consuming at the time of the biopsy .This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 16 Exposure Exposure from use in food 53. The relative proportions and total concentration of curcuminoids within turmeric rhizomes vary depending on the variety grown and the conditions of cultivation (Li et al. 2011) (Table 1). Table 1: Percentage composition of curcuminoids in turmeric powder s and oleoresin extracts (adapted from Li et al. 2011). Curcuminoid Composition in turmeric powders (mean) (% dry weight) Composition in turmeric oleoresin extracts (mean \u00b1 s.d.) for use as a colouring agent in food (E 100), where its purity is specified as \"not less than 90 % total colouring matters\" (i.e. diferuloylmeth ane, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin) (EC 2008). Moreover, JECFA (1992) stated that \"purified extracts of turmeric containing more than 90 % total colouring matter are subject to specifications for 'Curcumin' \"(JECFA 1992). EFSA (2010) noted that the specification should be updated to define the composition of the remaining 10 %, which may be accounted for by minor amounts of turmeric essential oil. Directive 94/36/EC states the maximum permitted levels (MPLs) for E100 in foodstuffs (which range from 20 to 500 mg/kg depending on the food item) and beverages (which range from 100 -200 mg/L) (EC 1994). 55. EFSA estimated dietary exposure to diferuloylmethane in children and adults using national consumption data with maximum permitted levels (MPLs) spec ified in Directive 94/36/EC (EC 1994) (tier 2 approach), and maximum reported use levels (tier 3 approach). Estimates of dietary exposure to diferuloylmethane obtained from these approaches are presented in Table 2. 56. For adults (> 18 years old), the EFSA Panel estimated the exposure based on the UK consumption survey as the UK population is considered to be one of the highest consumers of soft drinks in Europe and individual food consumption data (UK NDNS, 2000 -2001) are available (Tennant 2006, 2007). For children (1 -10 years old), the Panel estimated exposure based on dietary exposure assessments for children in Europe (EXPOCHI) project. The EXPOCHI project details individual food consumption data from eleven European countries (Belgium, France, the Nethe rlands, Spain, Italy, Finland, Sweden, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Greece and Germany). As the UK is not included in the EXPOCHI consortium, estimates for UK children (1.5 - 4.5 years old) were made by the Panel with the use of individual food consumption data (UK NDNS, 1992 -1993) (Tennant 2006, 2007).This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 17 Table 2: Estimates of dietary exposure to curcumin in the UK adult population and in children from the EXPOCHI study and UK. UK adult exposure (> 18 years old) to curcumin (mg/kg bw/day) Children (UK & EXPOCHI , 1- 10 years old) exposure to curcumin (mg/kg bw/day) Maximum permitted level (tier 2): Mean exposure 0.9 0.5-3.8 Exposure 97.5th %ile 3.3 1.2-7.2 Maximum reported use levels (tier 3): Mean exposure 0.8 (1.0 *) 0.5-3.4 (0.7 -3.6 *) Exposure 97.5th %ile 2.0 (2.6 *) 1.1-7.1 (1.6 -7.6 *) * Includes dietary exposure to diferuloylmethane from turmeric powder added to food as a spice and curry powder (see Table 3). 57. In tier 2, the main contributor to curcumin exposure from the UK adult diet was non -alcoholic flavoured drinks (46 %). The main contributors to the estimates of mean curcumin exposure for UK children (and children considered by the EXPOCHI consortium) were non -alcoholic beverages (13 - 55 %), fine bakery wares (e.g. biscuits, cakes, wafer) (12 -43 %), desserts, including flavoured milk products (12 -45 %), and sauces, seasonings, pickles, relishes, chutney and piccalilli (11 -42 %). 58. In tier 3, the main contributor to curcumin exposure from the UK adult diet was non -alcoholic flavoured drinks (50 %). The main contributors to the estimates of mean curcumin exposure for UK children (and children considered by the EXPOCHI consortium) were fine bakery wares (e.g. biscuits, cakes, wafer) (13 -47 %), desserts (including flavoured milk products) (13-52 %), non-alcoholic beverages (15 -57 %) and sauces and seasonings (11-45 %). 59. The exposure assessment in tier 3 does not take into account the use of turmeric as a spice in cooking. The addition of turmeric spice in cooking was estimated to contribute to the di etary exposure of diferuloylmethane by the EFSA panel (Table 3). Table 3: Estimates of dietary exposure to diferuloylmethane from ingestion of spice added to food and curry powder in adults in children. Adult (18 -64 years old) diferuloylmethane exposure (mg/kg bw/day) Children (5 -12 years old) diferuloylmethane exposure (mg/kg bw/day) Exposure from spice added to food * Mean 0.1 (n = 66) 0.1 (n = 7) 97.5th %ile 0.3 (n = 66) 0.2 (n = 7) Exposure from curry powder added to food * Mean 0.1 (n = 91 ) 0.1 (n = 21) 97.5th %ile 0.3 (n = 91) 0.3 (n = 21) 18 This is a draft statement for discussion.

The dietary intake of curry powder was also considere d, as turmeric powder is a widesprea d ingredient in it (approximately 30 % depending on the blend). 60. The above information is indicat ive o f the curren t exposu res to curcumin and/or turmeric as pa rt of the diet (food colour and as spice). However, consumption of raw and powdered turmeric in large quantit ies to promote wellbeing is becoming increasing ly popu lar. Based on information readily availab le on the internet5, it is proposed that to bene fit from turmeric's antioxidan t effects, one should consume between 500 to 1000 mg of curcumino ids per day . It is suggested tha t one teaspoon o f fresh or powdered turmeric contains 200 mg o f curcumin . Consumption s at the proposed levels, would lead to exposures to curcum in between 7.1 mg/kg bw/d and 14.3 mg/kg bw/d for a 70 kg adult, leading to exceedances up to 477% of the ADI. Using EFSA's default bodyweights, exposu res in infants, children and adolescents would range from 42 mg/kg bw/d (1400% of ADI) to 83 mg/kg bw/d (2767% todd lers aged mg/kg bw/d (273% of ADI) to 16mg/kg bw/d(533% of ADI) for adolescents aged 14-18 years old. Exposure through turmeric supplements 61. In addition to exposure to diferuloylmethane through a normal diet, turmeric supplements can also be taken. 62. Curcuminoids can be extracted from ground turmeric powder using organic solvents to create a turmeric oleoresin extract (Table 2). JECFA (1992) lists several solvents permitted for extraction : acetone, methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol. The European Commission, however, has a different list of permitted solvents: acetone, carbon dioxide, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, n -butanol, methanol, ethanol, and hexane (EC 2008). According to JECFA spe cifications, residual solvent concentrations in turmeric oleoresin intended for use in food are limited to 25 mg/kg for hexane, 30 mg/kg for acetone, dichloromethane, and 1,2 and 50 mg/kg for ethanol, methanol, and isopropanol (JECFA 1992). The extraction methodology used affects the curcuminoid content (37 -55 %) (Li et al. 2011), and the essential oil content (< 25%) (Braga et al. 2003) of the turmeric oleoresin (Table 4). 5 https://www.wellandgood.com/good -food/turmeric -anti-inflammatory -dosage/ This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 19 Table 4: Preparation and composition of turmeric products that are commercially available as dietary supplements (adapted from Li et al. 2011). Commercial product name Preparation Composition Turmeric powder Prepared from dried rhizomes of C. longa0.58-3.14 % diferuloylmethane (dry weight), and other curcuminoids Turmeric oleoresin extract Treat turmeric powder with organic solvents 37-55 % curcuminoids, < 25 % essential oil Turmeric oil extract Treat turmeric powder with steam distillation or supercritical CO 2 extraction Essential oil from leaves usually dominated by monoterpenes whilst oil from rhizomes mainly contains sesquiterpenes Curcumin turmeric oleoresin through crystallisation > 90 % curcuminoids, and minor amounts of essential oil 63. Whilst curcuminoids are responsible for the yellow -orange c olour of turmeric, it is the volatile sesquiterpenes present in the rhizome's essential oil that are responsible for its aroma and taste (Li et al. 2011). The major sesquiterpenes in turmeric oil extract are -, -, and Ar -turmerone (Li et al. 2011), which can together account for > 40 % of the essential oil present in turmeric rhizomes (Stanojevi et al. 2015). Turmerone possesses diverse pharmacological activities that include antioxidant and antimutagenic activities (Jayaprakasha et al. 2002). Turmeric o il extract can be prepared in various ways, for example through the treatment of turmeric powder with steam distillation, supercritical CO 2 extraction (Li et al. 2011), or by evaporating the organic solvent of a crude turmeric oleoresin extract (Funk et al . 2010) (Table 2). 64. Diferuloylmethane powder can be obtained through the purification of turmeric oleoresin by crystallisation (Li et al. 2011). However, there can be limited commercial availability of authentic samples of pure diferuloylmethane, since its separation from demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin can be difficult and time consuming. Thus, commercial \"pure\" diferuloylmethane is, in many cases, a mixture of at least these three curcuminoids (Li et al. 2011). For example, a sample of commerci al \"pure\" diferuloylmethane (labelled as 94 % purity) was, after HPLC analysis, found to be of about 70 % purity (Li et al. 2011). In addition, the composition of a sample of commercial \"curcumin\" was found to be approximately 71.5 % diferuloylmethane, 19. 4 % demethoxycurcumin, and 9.1 % bisdemethoxycurcumin (Pfeiffer et al. 2003). 65. Ground turmeric powder, turmeric oleoresin extract and diferuloylmethane powder are the compositions of turmeric that contain diferuloylmethane and which can be taken as supplem ents. A selection of these supplements (which can be readily purchased on the internet) are presented in Table 5, where the contribution of daily supplemental intake of diferuloylmethane to the ADI of 3 mg/kg bw/ day is calculated, with and without dietary diferuloylmethane. Of the supplements presented in Table 5, those containing ground turmeric powder do not exceed the ADI of 3 mg/kg bw/day for diferuloylmethane, either alone or with dietary intake of diferuloylmethane. Conversely, supplements comprising of turmeric oleoresin extract generally do lead to an exceedance of the ADI .This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 20 66. The FSA's Novel Foods Team consider turmeric food supplements comprising of turmeric oleoresin extract or pure curcumin powder to be novel. These products were not significantly used as a food or food ingredient before 15th of May 1997. Therefore, before these products may be placed on the market in the EU as a food supplement, a safety assessment under the Novel Food Regulation is required.

For turmeric powder, the calculation assumes 2.86 % is diferuloylmethane, e.g. (600 mg/day turmeric powder x 2.86 %) / 70 kg bw = 0.2 5 mg/kg bw/day. For turmeric oleoresin extract, calculation assumes 57.3 % of total curcuminoid content is diferuloylmethane (derived from Table 1). For Longvida\u00ae Optimised Curcumin, calculation assumes 25 % of the formulation is diferuloylmethane (Gota et al. 2010). Product formulation or composition expected to enhance bioavailability of diferuloylmethane. Assumes a mean contribution of 1.0 mg/kg bw/day diferuloylmethane from the diet for adults (see Table 3 ). Risk Characterisation 67. For raw and powdered turmeric /curcumin , consumption as part of the normal diet (from its use as an additive and spice) would lead to exposures that are generally within the ADI, apart from the high consumers group fo r children (Table 3). However , these exposures are conservative as the maximum reported levels were used for intake estimation. Generally, intake from the normal diet amounts to less than 7% of the ADI of 3 mg/kg bw/day (EFSA, 2010). 68. There is high uncerta inty regarding the risk for the intake of raw and powdered turmeric in high quantities for their purported health benefits . The literature review of human studies suggests oral diferuloylmethane in humans is well tolerated up to doses of 114 mg/kg bw/day, though minor symptoms of nausea or diarrhoea may occur. Long -term studies are lacking, however . 69. Additionally, c ontamination of raw turmeric with lead is a result of either turmeric grown on lead rich soil or intentional adulteration with lead chromate. Often lead chromate, a lead -based colour, is used to enhance the appearance of turmeric. As a result, raw or ground turmeric could potentially contain high levels of lead. 70. Lead in the body is distributed to the brain, liver, kidney and bones. It is stored in the teeth and bones, where it accumulates over time. Human exposure is usually assessed through the measurement of lead in blood. Lead in bone is released into blood during pregnancy and becomes a source of exposure to the developing fetus (WHO, 2017) . 71. The Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) identified developmental neurotoxicity in young children and cardiovascular effects and nephrotoxicity in adults as the critical effects for the risk assessment. The respective BMDLs derived from blood lead levels in \u00b5g/L (corresponding dietary intake values in \u00b5g/kg b w/d) were: developmental neurotoxicity BMDL01, systolic blood pressure BMDL01, 36 (1.50); effects on prevalence of chronic kidney disease BMDL10, 15 (0.63).This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 23 The Panel highlighted that by protecting children, who are far more sensitive, from the developmental effects of lead, the general population would also be protected from any adverse effects from lead. 72. The FSA recently received an enquiry where a family had been consuming raw turmeric (grown on lead -rich Indian soil) for over a year; following a blood test, the enquirer tested positive for lead. The enquirer mentioned that the family's young toddler had also been exposed to the contaminated turmeric. 73. It is impossible to be able to determine the risk to human health without analytical results from the contaminated batches of turmeric, that would allow for a quantitative risk assessment to be performed. 74. With re gard to supplements, exposure assessment for diet ary turmeric supplements indicates substantial exceedances of the ADI can occur for diferuloylmethane , which are generally for the supplements containing turmeric extracts . Furthermore , these supplements are generally modified to increase the bioavailabili ty of curcumin, which could potentially alter the toxicity profile of the chemical. As mentioned previously, information on the long term toxicity of curcumin is lacking, however safety margins are being eroded, meaning that the risk of adverse effects, pa rticularly, in vulnerable individuals is increased . 75. Based on the available information from both animal and human studies, it appears that there is a link to turmeric because the effects occurred upon challenge and were reversed after withdrawal. The symp toms are considered to be an idiosyncratic drug reaction. However, a role for a possible contaminant cannot be ruled out. The animal data is consistent with the human data. Conclusions 76. Turmeric is the common name for the rhizome (underground stem) of Curcuma longa L., a perennial herb cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. 77. Curcumin (E 100) is a dicinnamoylmethane dye authorised as a food additive in the EU . It has been evaluated by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additiv es (JECFA), the Scientific Committee on Food and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). An ADI of 3 mg/kg bw/d had been established based on a reproductive toxicity study by JECFA in 2004 and was re -confirmed in the evaluation by EFSA in 2010. 78. The con sumption of turmeric and/or curcumin either raw, powdered or in supplements has become increasingly popular due to the purported health benefits.This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the final views of the Committee and should not be cited. 24 79. Curcumin has low bioavailability, however in supplements synthetic forms of curcumin or chemical alterations are used to increase its bioavailability by up to 2000%, thus potentially altering its toxicity profile. 80. Consumption of turmeric/curcumin as part of the diet from its use as a food additive or as spice generally leads to exposures that are below the ADI . However, when consumed in high quantities for its purported health benefits, or via the intake of supplements, substantial exceedances of the ADI can occur . There is lack of information on the chronic toxicity of turmeric/curcumin thus the risk to health cannot be determined. Moreover , there is known contamination issues in turmeric, particularly with lead that are also associated with adverse health effects. However, due to the lack of analytical data the risk to health cannot be determined. 81. Regarding t he recent reports of hepatotoxicity, the Committee has reviewed all available data and have concluded that there is a link to turmeric because the effects occurred upon challenge and were reversed after withdrawal. The symptoms are consistent with an idios yncratic drug reaction. However, a role for a possible contaminant cannot be ruled out. The animal data is consistent with the human data. 82. The Committee agreed substantial exceedances of the ADI represent a potential health risk to humans, especially if o ther medicines are being taken concomitantly. 83. Given past reported contamination issues with turmeric supplements, the Committee concluded that there would be value in commissioning a chemical analysis of turmeric supplements and raw/powdered turmeric available on the UK market .
