About Bach Flower Essences Bach flower essences are a simple and completely safe method for all ages of addressing emotional and psychological disharmonies through the use of certain wild flowers. The remedies are simply prepared, and there are no side effects or worries of interactions with other medications or health contraindications. The flower remedies are named after their discoverer, Dr. Edward Bach who realized that sickness and disease were not primarily due to physical causes but to some deeper emotional disharmony. The principle to treat the client, not the disease, the basic idea behind the flower remedies. How do flower essences work? When we use a herbal remedy and even essential oils we are for the most part making use of the physical energy of the plant to rebalance the body in the form of active chemical constituents that have physiological effects on the body that can be measured, and even though they can be effective care must be taken for certain health conditions, age, or if medications are involved. Flower remedies make use of vibrational energy. Everything is energy, and contains a vital energy or life force. This vital energy is said to regulate a person's health and these systems are based on the concept that illness and disease result from the disruption in the flow of the vital life force. Reiki, crystals, and other forms of energy work all are based on the same principles. Flower essences can be taken alone or combined with other types of energy work and even herbal remedies. During a consultation here at the studio we would determine what would be best for your individual needs through by using a series of questions, discussion, and intuitive guidance. Bach Flower Essences are also available in the healing boutique here at the studio and can be special ordered. \"Let not the simplicity of this method deter you from its use, for you will find the further your researches advance, the greater you will realize the simplicity of all creation\" ~Dr. Edward Bach "}
