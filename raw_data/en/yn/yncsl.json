And truthfully, this is nothing new. As long as vaccines have existed there has been doctor and parent opposition to them. In my research on smallpox for example, I found reference to a British treatise written in 1878 by Mary Catherine Hume. It is titled: \"150 Reasons for disobeying the Vaccination Law by Persons Prosecuted Under It\". A copy of that treatise is the photo for this post. How true it is that \"Nothing is new under the sun!\" At the time of this treatise, parents were being fined and jailed for refusing to submit their children to the treatments. In her treatise she advocated civil disobedience in response to to the many homes and properties that were being confiscated. Though this seems extreme to us now, there are current cases of children being taken from their parents for not submitting to vaccinations. Much of the pro-vaccine rhetoric circulating currently is suggesting all manner of quarantine, ostracism, and scarlet letter designation for all parents who don't vaccinate their children. The debate rages on! Where do you stand on vaccines? Do you follow the schedule in full, do a delayed schedule or pass entirely on them for yourself and family? I'm writing a series of posts for the next few weeks unpacking all sorts of aspects that are not covered fully in the vaccine discussion. The part that we know and hear constantly in the current standard of use is a [ full schedule for children ](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch-0-6yrs.pdf)and then a separate schedule for [ teens ](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/who/teens/downloads/parent-version-schedule-7-18yrs.pdf)and [adults](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/adult/adult-schedule-easy-read.pdf) [. ](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/adult/adult-schedule-easy-read.pdf) The original narrative for vaccine use and promotion was produced and disseminated by the same entities that made the vaccines. Vaccines didn't start with doctors or even schools, they were created by pharmaceutical companies. Vaccines are produced by the major pharmaceutical companies like GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi Pasteur, Novartis, and Merck to name a few. Producing a vaccine requires about 12-15 years of research and costs are estimated between $500 million and $1 billion dollars. This financial landscape means that the vaccine industry is unlikely to invest in a product that will not both pay for itself and turn a profit. This also means that like any business, the bottom line is KEY. Money must be made, costs covered, profit is the most important aspect. As I will talk about in the many posts to come, this aspect suggests that public health and even vaccine safety MAY NOT be the only reason for the insistence on vaccines for everyone. I come out of the traditional naturopathic world and you will be hard pressed to find anyone in this world that supports vaccine use. I'm writing this series of posts to go into detail WHY that is the case. So much about our position has been skewed, misrepresented, misunderstood, or blatantly lied about. Often the people out front talking about not vaccinating their children are easy targets to discredit and perhaps not the best people to represent this stance. Many are very well-meaning and earnest in their concern but provide an easy target for malign - the current target is Jenny McCarthy! Jenny may not be a doctor or researcher, but she knows better than anyone HER CHILD, and her experience with him cannot be dismissed. Nor that of any parent who is raising a vaccine-damaged child. This post is my chance to educate, challenge, and share what I know that has led to me to the stance I have. As an assignment for school I had to make a tri-fold brochure for parents to read giving bullet points about vaccines. I like that approach because it sets the stage to expand on each one for further discussion. Here are the bullet points that I included in my brochure: 1) There have been no safety studies on vaccines. A safety study is a process used in the research world where one substance is measured against a non-toxic substance like water or something considered inert. Vaccines have NEVER been subjected to this sort of study. Isn't that surprising? Not in all their history has that happened. 2) Many of the ingredients in vaccines create problems down the road in the human body, either biologically or morally. Vaccines are cultured or made with various animal tissues from monkeys, cows, chickens (eggs), dogs, and sheep. The viral impurities found in those cells are transmitted through to the vaccines, recombine with human virus load and create the potential for disease. Are you surprised to know that MSG is in many vaccines? MSG is frowned upon in our food but is found in the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. How is it not okay in one context but fine in another? 3) Some vaccines use tissue from aborted fetal tissue to culture or produce the vaccine. It is far more complex to manufacture biological medications (for example, vaccines, antibodies) than it is to produce chemical medications (for example, penicillin or aspirin). Viruses cannot reproduce on their own. They require a living host in which to grow, such as chicken embryos, and cells from animals that are grown in culture. Vaccine manufacturers currently have few options for viral culture, and my understanding about this is that it is due to human safety concerns. Human diploid cells are the cells in question that originally came from aborted fetal tissue. Human diploid cells are batches of human cells that are grown in a laboratory. Two different strains of human diploid cell cultures made from fetuses have been used extensively for vaccine production for decades. One was developed in the United States in 1961 (called WI-38) and the other in the United Kingdom in 1966 (called MRC-5). The use of aborted fetal tissue represents a religious/moral dilemma for many people and at the very least could be considered a conflict of interest! 4) The amount of vaccines that children receive has tripled in less than 6 decades. In 1940 there were 4 doses on the children's schedule and as of 2015, the dosage is 49 by age 6. Valid questions are being brought to light regarding the rise of chronic illness during this time frame among children as well as neurological issues. 5) Did you know that the pharmaceutical industry carries no liability in regards to damages caused by vaccines? Each vaccine given in this country has a small amount of tax collected from it that is funneled to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The program is run by government agencies - NOT the industry that made the product. How many industries do you know that are able to foist their liability into a government run program? Here's the big questions to think through: Why does the government, through 3 agencies, manage, arbitrate, and deliver any and all regulation as it relates to the liability of a product they DO NOT PRODUCE? The Department of Health and Human Services determines what standards are set in regards to vaccine administration and damage. The Department of Justice and the Court of Federal Claims manage the legal aspect of court cases regarding their filing and administration.The Department of Treasury collects the excise taxes and manages the Fund's investments. In effect, consumers are effectively paying for both the cause and effect should a vaccine injury occur. There is an additional problem of the high bar and hoops parents have to jump through to prove a vaccine injury - the standard was set at an almost impossible level. However, MILLIONS of dollars have been awarded. Does this seem like it's on the up-and up to you? 6) The brain has it's own immune system that is put into a state of inflammation EVERY TIME a vaccine is administered. Here's a quote from Dr. Blaylock, a retired, premier neurosurgeon who has devoted his career to educating people about the dangers of vaccinations to the brain: \"What is less well known by doctors in practice, especially pediatricians, is that vaccines also activate the brain's special immune system. The central immune cells in the brain are called microglia. These normally sleeping immune cells become highly activated when a vaccination is given. After activation they can move around the brain secreting very toxic amounts of inflammatory chemicals and two forms of excitotoxins. This puts the brain in a chronically inflamed state. When the brain is inflamed, it results in a physical change, something we call sickness behavior. You may recall how you feel when you have the flu, with difficulty thinking, being very sleepy and restless. Headaches are also common with an inflamed brain. Many parents notice that their children have a high-pitched cry soon after their vaccination or vaccinations. This is called the encephalitic cry, meaning that it is caused by an inflamed, swollen brain. It explains the difficulty parents have in waking their children, the vomiting, passing out and irritability following vaccinations. These are all signs of an inflamed brain. The reason that pediatricians are telling parents that their children's reactions to these vaccines are normal is based on at least two factors. One, most pediatricians know absolutely nothing about a child's brain. The second reason is that they are trying to avoid a lawsuit.\" 7) Nutrition, sanitation, and antibiotics show the most clear parallels of disease eradication of all the diseases we currently vaccinate for. Let's also not forget the cycles of disease that have existed for centuries in humans. Though we've come to a place of wanting to eradicate disease entirely, disease cycles were well-known and commonly understood by earlier peoples. Older generations of people speak clearly about common childhood illnesses that everyone had that conferred life-long, true immunity. A very important point that never seems to be talked about is that some diseases, like scarlet fever, disappeared on their own and a vaccine was never developed for it. We give vaccines a whole lot more credit than clean, safe drinking water, proper sanitation removal, and excellent nutrition. These are the points that I used to assist me in taking a position on vaccination. I highly encourage everyone to do their own independent research using EVERY source they can find. Once you start, my suggestions are to keep an open mind, examine conflicts of interest, question, engage in respectful discourse, talk to many people on all sides of the issue, and then take your position. Thank you for taking the time to read this, I hope this gives you some insight and clarity on why many of us do not support vaccination! And let's remember, there's nothing new under "}
