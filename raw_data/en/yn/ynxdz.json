Diluent: A liquid used to mix with a lyophilized (powder) vaccine in order to reconstitute the lyophilized vaccine and provide the final vaccine for administration. Important clarification of the use of the word diluent in this module In this module diluent means: A liquid product which is pharmacologically inactive or another vaccine used to reconstitute (for dissolution) a lyophilized vaccine. District vaccine store: Store receiving vaccine from a primary or subnational vaccine store for storage and onward delivery to health facilities, also known as a lowest delivery-level store. Electronic freeze indicator: A small device that is placed with freeze-sensitive vaccines during transport. The device has a visual display that indicates whether vaccine has been exposed to freezing temperatures. Electronic shipping indicator: A single-use temperature monitoring device placed with international or in-country vaccine shipments by the vaccine manufacturer. The device records temperatures at regular time intervals and has pre- set visual alarms to reflect the heat and/or freeze sensitivity thresholds of the vaccine being shipped. Fixed gas/vapour pressure thermometer: A thermometer in which the variable saturated vapour pressure of a volatile liquid is used as a measure of the temperature and which thus has the advantage over some other types of thermometers of being free from errors due to bulb expansion. Integrated digital thermometer: A permanent temperature monitoring device that is built into cold rooms, freezer rooms, refrigerators and freezers. Temperature sensors monitor the temperature constantly, and the temperature is displayed digitally outside the room or refrigerator/freezer. Phase-change material: A substance (other than water) with a high heat of fusion that melts and solidifies at a certain temperature and is capable of storing and releasing large amounts of energy. Heat is absorbed or released when the material changes from solid to liquid and vice versa. The phase- change materials used for vaccine transport typically change state at around +5\u00b0C. Primary container: Vial, ampoule, prefilled device, plastic dispenser or tube containing vaccine or diluent. Primary vaccine store: A store that receives vaccine deliveries from the vaccine manufacturer, generally the national vaccine store. However, this may also be a state- or regional-level store in larger countries.Programmable electronic temperature and event logger system: A system that continuously logs temperatures in cold rooms, freezer rooms, refrigerators and freezers via multiple sensors. These systems can be configured to monitor events such as door openings as well as other performance characteristics such as relative humidity and energy consumption. The sensors are linked to a central computer or base station via wired or wireless connections. Typically the system is linked to local alarm sounders and/or alarm strobes and can be configured to send alerts to responsible staff via auto-dialer, email and SMS (short-message service)-enabled devices. Web-based systems are also available which allow for centralized or distributed remote monitoring. A characteristic of these systems is that they require site-specific configuration and installation. Similar systems are available for refrigerated vehicles. Service level: A health facility or health post that provides routine immunization services. Vaccine may or may not be permanently stored in such facilities. Shake test: A method to determine whether vaccines containing aluminium adjuvant have been damaged by freezing. To perform the test, the vaccine container is vigorously shaken along with a control (a vaccine vial from the same manufacturer and lot number that has been frozen overnight at 20 \u00b0C and then thawed), the contents are examined for physical changes and the extent of sedimentation is compared to the control vial. A vaccine with a sedimentation rate that is as fast as or faster than that of the control has been frozen. Standard operating procedure: Detailed, written and/or visual instructions designed to ensure that a specific task or function is carried out in a consistent and uniform manner. Storage temperature: The temperature range for vaccine storage as stated by the manufacturer on the primary container label and the package insert and within the regulatory filings for the product. Some manufacturers also provide a temperature range for vaccine transport. Subnational vaccine store: A store which receives vaccine from the primary vaccine store or from a higher-level subnational store. Supply chain: A system of organizations, people, activities, information and resources involved in moving a product from the supplier to end-user in a manner that ensures that the product arrives in good condition. Temperature excursion: An excursion event during which a vaccine is exposed to temperatures outside the range(s) prescribed for storage and/or transport. Temperature ranges for storage and transport may be the same or different; they are determined by the product manufacturer based on stability data. In situations in which cool water-packs are used for vaccine transport, an excursion up to a maximum of +20\u00b0C is acceptable. Temperature threshold indicator: A chemical indicator which irreversibly shows whether vaccine has been exposed to temperatures above or below a pre-set limit. Thirty-day electronic temperature logger: A device placed with vaccines, primarily for use in refrigerators. The device logs the temperature and displays alarm violations for the last 30 days (on a rolling basis). Alarm thresholds are pre-programmed by the device manufacturer in accordance with World Health Organization Performance, Quality and Safety specifications. The term 30-day temperature recorder (30 DTR) is often used interchangeably. User programmable temperature logger: An electronic device primarily used for temperature monitoring studies. The user is able to start and stop the device and set the frequency of temperature recordings and alarms. Vaccine arrival report: The vaccine arrival report provides a means of indicating inadequacies in the shipping process and problems relating to the condition of vaccines at the time of delivery. The report is a printed checklist sent with each vaccine shipment and used to record the status and condition of the vaccines on arrival. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) vaccine arrival report is used to record temperature conditions during transport, physical damage, accompanying paperwork and compliance with shipping instructions. The report is to be filled in by authorized consignees' staff and forwarded to UNICEF Supply Division within three days of vaccine arrival.Vaccine vial monitors:3 Chemical-indicator labels placed on vaccine vials, ampoules, tubes or other types of primary containers by the vaccine manufacturer. A vaccine vial monitor shows the cumulative heat exposure that an individual container of vaccine has received through a gradual and irreversible colour change. 3 Vaccine vial monitor [website].

Introduction This module describes the correct use of available temperature monitoring devices for routine monitoring of cold chain equipment performance, temperature mapping of cold chain equipment and implementation of studies to assess supply chain temperatures. To ensure good storage and distribution practices, effective, well-managed temperature monitoring and record-keeping procedures are crucial. These procedures help to ensure that: yvaccine quality is maintained throughout the vaccine supply chain; yvaccine is not wasted due to exposure to heat or freezing temperatures at fixed storage locations or during transport; ycold chain equipment performs according to recommended standards; and ywhen problems arise, they are rapidly detected and corrective action is taken. The temperatures to which vaccines are exposed must be monitored, recorded and reported throughout the vaccine supply chain, from the manufacturer's point of origin to the point of vaccination. This provides documented evidence of the temperatures to which products have been exposed during storage and transport; it also provides a means of detecting cold chain equipment failures and other operational problems so that they can be rectified. Responsible personnel need to know the correct storage conditions for all vaccines in their country's schedule. They must also know how to do the following: use the appropriate temperature monitoring devices, recognize and respond to temperature excursions, record temperatures, and take corrective action when problems occur. To achieve these outcomes, countries should develop suitable policies and standard operating procedures (SOPs) and provide adequate training, tools, supervision and resources to ensure that these policies and procedures are properly implemented. The availability of new technologies, especially the vaccine vial monitor (VVM), 30-day temperature recorder (30 DTR) and advances in information and communication systems, provide great opportunities for supply chain improvement. This module provides guidance on how to use these new technologies to implement comprehensive and systematic temperature monitoring at all levels in the supply chain. 1.1 Objectives of this module The objectives of this module are to: a. provide background information on the temperature sensitivities of vaccines and diluents and their recommended storage temperatures and on the common sources of heat and freeze exposure in supply chains; b. describe available temperature monitoring devices and their uses in routine temperature monitoring, temperature mapping of cold chain equipment and studies to assess supply chain temperatures; c. provide guidance on record-keeping and management of temperature data; d. highlight the importance and essential components of contingency plans for cold chain equipment breakdowns, power supply failures, transport emergencies or other situations that put vaccine at risk; e. explain when and why calibration of temperature monitoring devices is needed; and f. provide managers with suggestions on training, what to look for during supervisory visits and where to find information on the relevant policies, procedures and additional details on each topic. 1.2 Target audience This module is intended to be read by Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) managers and supporting partners and those responsible for: a. selecting and purchasing temperature monitoring devices; b. overseeing the validation and monitoring of vaccine stores, cold chain equipment and vaccine distribution routes; c. developing SOPs for the vaccine supply chain; d. developing the training curriculum and training materials for temperature monitoring activities. VMH-E2: How to monitor temperatures in the vaccine supply chain2 In order to maintain their quality, all vaccines must be protected from temperature extremes and other environmental hazards. 2.1 Sensitivity to temperature and light It is essential to administer potent vaccine in order to trigger an immune response that will protect the vaccinated patient. Vaccines are sensitive biological products that can be damaged to varying extents by exposure to freezing temperatures, to heat and to light; once vaccine potency is lost, it cannot be regained. All those who handle vaccines and diluents must know the temperature sensitivities of the products used in their programme and the products' recommended storage and distribution temperatures. In order to protect these products from damage, they must also understand how to prevent freeze, heat and light exposure. 2.1.1 Types of diluent4 Some vaccines are lyophilized and must be combined with a liquid component called a diluent or another vaccine (in liquid form) before injection, a process called reconstitution. Reconstitution must be done strictly in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions because it involves the use of a diluent (or another vaccine), and these diluent products are NOT interchangeable. There are some types of diluents\u2014for example, diluents containing an aluminium matrix\u2014that must be protected from freezing, and some diluents that are freeze- sensitive vaccines themselves. Oral vaccines such as rotavirus may require a diluent which cannot be safely injected. Vaccine handling and storage recommendations have evolved in the past decade, underlining the need for the recently updated WHO guidance note on the proper handling of vaccine diluents.4 Because of the variety of diluents available, it is essential that each vaccine be reconstituted only with its assigned diluent. Note: For the purposes of this document, where reference is made to \"diluent\" as a generic term, it refers to a liquid that is mixed with a lyophilized powder to reconstitute the lyophilized vaccine and provide the final vaccine for administration. In strict pharmaceutical terms a diluent is an inactive substance, such as water for injection or normal saline. In this document the diluent (liquid used for reconstitution) may also be another vaccine (active substance) used to reconstitute one vaccine to provide a combination vaccine.4 The most common diluent is a pharmacologically inactive aqueous solution or water for injection; this type of diluent is used to reconstitute a lyophilized vaccine such as bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine (BCG) or a measles-containing vaccine which is administered by injection. Additional pharmacologically inactive diluents include many of the solutions used to make up an oral vaccine such as cholera. Diluents for oral vaccines tend to be of significantly large volumes per dose and are not formulated for injection. When packed separately from the vaccine, these diluents typically do not need to be stored in the 4 WHO Guidance Note: Proper handling of vaccine diluents (2015 revision). Geneva: World Health Organization; 2015.cold chain to maintain their stability and shelf life. If the package insert gives specific lower and upper temperature limits, these must be observed. In the absence of specific instructions, these diluents should be treated the same as any other non-cold chain pharmaceutical, protected from freezing and stored and transported between +2\u00b0C and +25\u00b0C. Some diluents are pharmacologically active. These include liquid vaccines that are used to reconstitute a lyophilized component of a polyvalent vaccine (such as a liquid DTP-HepB vaccine that is used to reconstitute a lyophilized Hib vaccine) and diluents with active ingredients (such as the freeze-sensitive diluent for meningitis A vaccine that contains an aluminium phosphate adjuvant). When the diluent and vaccine are packed (bundled) together in the same secondary carton as the vaccine, they must be stored in the cold chain in accordance with the vaccine manufacturer's instructions. When they are not packed together, the storage instructions in the package insert must be observed. In general, whenever cold chain capacity permits, WHO recommends that both diluents and their corresponding vaccines should be stored and transported together in the cold chain; this practice makes stock management easier and reduces the risk that diluents will become separated from the vaccines to which they belong. 2.1.2 Heat sensitivity of vaccines All vaccines lose their potency over time, and heat accelerates this potency loss. Vaccine types vary in their sensitivity to heat. For any given vaccine type, the heat sensitivity also varies between the brands made by different manufacturers.5,6 Table 1 provides an overview of the heat sensitivity of different vaccines. Freeze-dried vaccines are shown in bold type. The right-hand column shows the relative heat sensitivity of each of six groups of vaccine divided by horizontal lines. Within each group, the vaccines are arranged in alphabetical order, NOT in order of sensitivity to heat. However, the vaccines in each group are more heat sensitive than those in the groups below them. Note that the heat stability information shown for freeze-dried vaccines applies only to unopened vials; most freeze-dried vaccines rapidly lose potency after reconstitution. In addition, opened vials of vaccines that do not contain a preservative are at risk of contamination; to minimize this risk, opened vials must be kept cold, at between +2\u00b0C and +8\u00b0C.7 5 Temperature sensitivity of vaccines 2006 ( http:/ /www.who.int/immunization/documents/WHO_ IVB_06.10/en/index.html , accessed 31 March 2015). 6 PATH, Working in Tandem, Ltd.

Protection of vaccines and diluentsVMH-E2: How to monitor temperatures in the vaccine supply chain3 Table 1.

Note: Freeze-dried vaccines Heat sensitivity of diluents Pharmacologically inactive diluents are often packed separately because they are more heat stable than the vaccines they accompany; these diluents can safely be stored and transported at room temperature until they reach the service level. In a few cases, pharmacologically inactive diluents are packed together (bundled) with the vaccine; these products should always be stored and transported together throughout the cold chain. Pharmacologically active diluents are usually heat sensitive and are packed in the same secondary carton as their accompanying vaccine; they must be stored and transported together throughout the cold chain. If they are not packed together, follow the manufacturer's instructions for storage and transport. All diluents must be kept between +2\u00b0C and +8\u00b0C during storage at the service level and after reconstitution at an immunization session. The same rule applies when vaccines and diluents are transported for outreach operations. Reconstituted vaccine must be kept at between +2\u00b0C and +8\u00b0C during immunization sessions.8,9 Application of the multi- dose vial policy (MDVP) in controlled temperature chain (CTC) settings10 will vary by vaccine. The product insert and the WHO website provide information on how to apply the MDVP for reconstituted vaccines in CTC settings. 2.1.4 Freeze sensitivity of vaccines Many vaccines can tolerate freezing, including freeze-dried vaccines (such as measles-containing vaccines) and oral polio vaccine (OPV).11,12 However, freezing can irreversibly damage vaccines that contain aluminium-salt adjuvants (aluminium phosphate or aluminium hydroxide).13,14 The adjuvant clumps together (agglomerates) when the vaccine has been frozen, and the immunological properties are adversely affected.15 Injection of a previously frozen vaccine may be associated with a reduced immune response or an increased incidence of local reactions.12 Aluminium adjuvants are the most common adjuvant type used in human vaccines and are included in many products, for example vaccines containing diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and hepatitis B antigens as well as the diluent for the meningitis A conjugate vaccine. Some vaccines that do not contain an aluminium adjuvant are also damaged by freezing, including some oral cholera, inactivated polio and influenza vaccines. Table 2 shows which vaccines are damaged by freezing and which are not. Freeze-dried vaccines are shown in bold type. Within each of the groups, the vaccines are arranged in alphabetical order, NOT in order of sensitivity to freezing. However, all the vaccines in the top group are more freeze sensitive than those in the second group. 8 WHO policy on the use of opened multi-dose vaccine vials (2014 revision). http:/ /www.who.int/immunization/documents/general/ WHO_IVB_14.07/en/ , accessed 31 March 2015). 9 The only exceptions to this rule are for vaccines that are licensed for CTC operations and for which the manufacturer's instructions specifically state that a higher temperature is acceptable after reconstitution. 10 More information about the controlled temperature chain is available at: http:/ / www.who.int/immunization/programmes_systems/supply_chain/resources/ tools/en/index6.html 11 Temperature sensitivity 2006 ( http:/ /www.who.int/immunization/documents/WHO_ IVB_06.10/en/index.html , accessed 31 March 2015). 12 PATH, Working in Tandem, Ltd.

Note: Freeze-dried vaccines are bold. * The diluent for meningitis A vaccine is damaged by freezing.2.1.5 Freeze sensitivity of diluents All diluents must be protected from freezing; they are often supplied in ampoules which are physically delicate and likely to crack if the contents are frozen. In addition, although many diluent formulations are water for injection or simple salt solutions, some are pharmacologically active; for example, the diluent for meningitis A conjugate vaccine contains an aluminium adjuvant. 2.1.6 Photosensitivity of vaccines Certain vaccines such as BCG, measles and rubella lose potency when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light. For this reason, some manufacturers supply these vaccines in vials made of dark glass. In general, it is good practice to protect all vaccine primary containers from sunlight and from UV-emitting artificial light sources such as fluorescent tubes and compact fluorescent bulbs. This is especially important at the periphery of the supply chain when vaccines are removed from their secondary cartons. 2.2 Recommended storage temperatures for vaccines and diluents With a few exceptions, vaccines should be stored at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C. To preserve its potency for as long as possible, OPV should be stored in freezers at -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C in primary and subnational stores. Freeze-dried vaccines packed separately from their diluent, such as BCG and measles-containing vaccines, can be stored in freezer rooms and vaccine freezers at national, subnational and district levels where this makes best use of available cold chain capacity. Freeze-dried vaccines that are packed (bundled) with their diluent must NEVER be frozen. If the package insert gives specific lower and upper temperature limits for storing separately packed diluents , these temperature limits must be observed. When there is limited space in the cold chain, these diluents may be stored outside the cold chain until they reach the service level; at this point it is essential to follow the vaccine manufacturer's instructions regarding cooling before and after reconstitution. In the absence of specific instructions, separately packed diluents should be treated the same way as any other non-cold chain pharmaceuticals: protected from freezing and stored and transported between +2\u00b0C and +25\u00b0C until they reach the service delivery level. However, where cold chain capacity permits, WHO recommends that both diluents and their corresponding vaccines be stored and transported together in the cold chain at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C. This practice makes stock management easier and reduces the risk that diluents will become separated from the vaccines to which they belong.16 As noted above, diluents should NEVER be frozen. Figure 1 summarizes the WHO-recommended storage temperatures and maximum storage periods for vaccines and diluents. 16 WHO Guidance Note: Proper handling of vaccine diluents (2015 revision).

If diluents are packaged with vaccine, the product should be stored at +2\u00baC to +8\u00baC.

A controlled temperature chain (CTC) is an approach used to distribute some of the more heat-stable vaccines to remote and difficult-to-access areas, allowing storage and transport at ambient temperatures for a limited period of time just before administration, when access to refrigeration and ice may be extremely limited. Effective temperature monitoring is an important component of a CTC approach. While in a CTC, vaccines are kept in cold boxes, shaded from direct sunlight, and monitored with vaccine vial monitors as well as peak threshold temperature indicators that help to measure cumulative and peak exposure to heat. WHO has issued programmatic guidance17 to guide CTC implementation with specific vaccines that are prequalified for use at temperatures of up to 40\u00b0C for a limited period of time as appropriate to the stability of the antigen. Application of the multi-dose vial policy (MDVP) in CTC settings may vary by vaccine. It is important to consult the product insert and the WHO website on how to apply the MDVP for each CTC vaccine. 17 Use of MenAfriVac (meningitis A vaccine) in a controlled temperature chain (CTC) during campaigns.

Table 3 shows common causes of heat and freeze exposure. Freeze exposure is a particular challenge; studies in developing and industrialized countries throughout the world have shown that accidental exposure to sub-zero temperatures is common and occurs during transportation between all levels of the cold chain.18 18 Matthias DM, Robertson J, Garrison MM, Newland S, Nelson C. Freezing temperatures in the vaccine cold chain: a systematic literature review. Vaccine. 2007;25(20):3980-6.VMH-E2: How to monitor temperatures in the vaccine supply chain6 Table 3. Some common causes of vaccine heat and freeze exposure Causes of heat exposure Causes of freeze exposure During storage yElectrical power failures causing breaks in the cold chain. yLack of fuel (gas or kerosene) for refrigerators used in areas with no electricity. yCold chain equipment breakdown. yStoring vaccines in nonmedical cold chain equipment like domestic refrigerators or freezers which are not designed for this purpose. yStoring freeze-sensitive vaccines close to cold room refrigeration units or in other cold spots such as the dividing wall between a freezer room and a cold room. yIncorrect thermostat adjustment in cold rooms and refrigerators with adjustable thermostats. yFailure to use the baskets supplied with ice-lined refrigerators/ allowing freeze-sensitive vaccines to be stored outside the manufacturer's designated safe storage zone. yStoring freeze-sensitive vaccines in domestic refrigerators in close proximity to the evaporator plate.

During immunization sessions yExposure of vaccines to high ambient temperatures during immunization sessions. yNot applicable. These risks can be mitigated by: yusing WHO-prequalified cold rooms, freezer rooms, refrigerators, freezers, cold boxes and vaccine carriers; ychoosing a power source (mains electricity, solar, gas or kerosene) that is appropriate to the location and the climatic conditions; yinstalling standby generators to provide backup power in larger vaccine stores; yinstalling voltage regulators to protect mains-powered equipment against voltage fluctuations; yusing WHO-prequalified temperature monitoring devices; yconducting routine monitoring, recording and analysis of cold chain temperatures collected from temperature monitoring devices; yimplementing effective procedures for preventive maintenance and repair of cold chain equipment; yusing SOPs to standardize day-to-day operations and training staff to follow the SOPs and equipment manufacturers' user manuals; ydeveloping and rehearsing contingency plans. Specific measures to prevent and detect vaccine freezing include: yarranging vaccines appropriately in the refrigerator; ycorrect use of cold boxes and vaccine carriers for vaccine transport\u2014see the companion VMH module: How to use passive containers and coolant packs for vaccine transport and outreach operations ; yusing WHO-prequalified temperature monitoring devices that signal freeze exposures; yconducting routine monitoring, recording and analysis of cold chain temperatures collected from temperature monitoring devices; yrecognizing damaged vaccines through the use of the shake test. WHO has published specifications for a new class of freeze-free cold boxes and vaccine carriers which can use unconditioned ice-packs.19 Products are under development and are expected to be available in the near future. 19 See specifications in: Category documentation [website]. accessed 31 March 2015). VMH-E2: How to monitor temperatures in the vaccine supply chain7 In order to maintain vaccine quality, it is essential to monitor the temperature of vaccines throughout the supply chain. Effective monitoring and record-keeping achieves the following objectives: a. verification that vaccine storage temperatures are within the acceptable ranges of +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C in cold rooms and vaccine refrigerators and -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C in freezer rooms and vaccine freezers; b. detection of out-of-range storage temperatures so that corrective action can be taken; c. detection of out-of-range transport temperatures so that corrective action can be taken. Well-maintained records can be used to assess the quality of the vaccine supply chain, monitor the performance of cold chain equipment over time and demonstrate compliance with good storage and distribution practices. In primary vaccine stores, continuous temperature monitoring is required; it is recommended in small subnational stores and health facilities. Regardless of the temperature monitoring device used, temperatures in fixed storage locations should continue to be recorded manually twice a day, seven days a week in large vaccine stores and at least five days a week in smaller subnational vaccine stores and health facilities. Recording temperatures twice daily manually ensures that there is a staff member tasked with monitoring cold chain equipment performance and who can act to resolve issues quickly.20 3.1 Temperature monitoring devices and their uses WHO recommends temperature monitoring devices based on the specific cold chain equipment application and the intended monitoring purpose. WHO's Performance, Quality and Safety (PQS) specifications and verification protocols set minimum technical and usability standards for these devices. Suitable products are then prequalified for purchase by countries and United Nations agencies. Temperature monitoring technology is evolving rapidly. The range of available devices extends beyond those that are currently prequalified, although the performance quality and durability of these devices is unknown. WHO continues to monitor the market and periodically updates performance specifications to reflect technological developments and changing user needs. Information on currently available WHO-prequalified temperature monitoring devices and performance specifications can be found on the WHO PQS website.21 Annex 1 gives detailed recommendations on the use of prequalified devices at all points in the supply chain. Annex 2 provides information on device procurement. 20 EVM model standard operating procedures: Consolidated version with user guide (version 3). Geneva: Organization; 2013 ( http:/ - prequalified devices and equipment , accessed 31 March 2015).The remainder of Chapter 3 describes the various types of devices used for routine monitoring and describes where and how they should be used. Some devices are only used in fixed storage locations, some are only used during transport and some are used for both storage and transport. Devices used primarily for temperature study purposes are described in Chapter 5. 3.2 Monitoring heat exposure using vaccine vial monitors Vaccine vial monitors (VVMs) are the only temperature monitoring devices that routinely accompany vaccines throughout the entire supply chain. A VVM is a chemical- indicator label which is applied to a vaccine vial, ampoule or other type of primary container by the vaccine manufacturer. As the container moves through the supply chain, the VVM records cumulative heat exposure through a gradual change in colour (see Figure 2). If the colour of the inner square is the same or darker than the colour of the outer circle, the vaccine should be discarded. Note that VVMs DO NOT record exposure to freezing temperatures. 3. Routine temperature monitoring VMH-E2: How to monitor temperatures in the vaccine supply chain8 Figure 2. Vaccine vial monitor colour change sequence and interpretation VVM start colour of the square is never snow-white, it always has a bluish-grey tinge. From then on, until the temperature and/or duration of heat reaches a level known to degrade the vaccine beyond acceptable limits, the inner square remains lighter than the outer circle.

There are currently four VVM types. In liaison with WHO, vaccine manufacturers use the type most appropriate to the stability profile of their vaccine. Table 4 shows the reaction rates of each VVM type at three different temperatures. VVMs are included on nearly all vaccines purchased through the United Nations Children's fund (UNICEF). WHO recommends that donors and countries that procure vaccines directly from manufacturers request VVMs in their procurement tenders.22,23 The main purpose of VVMs is to ensure that heat-damaged vaccines are not administered. VVM status is also used to decide 22 WHO-UNICEF policy statement on the use of vaccine vial monitors in immunization services (WHO/V&B/99.18). Geneva: World Health Organization; 1999 (http:/ /whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1999/WHO_V&B_99.18.pdf , accessed 31 March 2015). 23 WHO-UNICEF policy statement on the implementation of vaccine vial monitors: The role of vaccine vial monitors in improving access to immunization (WHO/IVB/07.04). Geneva: World Health Organization; 2007 ( http:/ /www.who.int/immunization/ documents/WHO_IVB_07.04/en/index.html , accessed 31 March 2015). which vaccines can safely be kept after a cold chain break occurs; this minimizes unnecessary vaccine wastage. In addition, VVM status helps determine the order in which vaccines should be used\u2014a batch of vaccine with VVMs that show significant heat exposure but have not yet reached their discard points should be distributed and used ahead of a batch that shows lower heat exposure, even if the expiry date is later. In order to ensure vaccine traceability in the supply chain, VVM status should be checked before dispatch and manually recorded on arrival vouchers at stores and health facilities. VVMs should also be checked by health workers before the vaccine is used.VMH-E2: How to monitor temperatures in the vaccine supply chain9 3.3 Monitoring international vaccine shipments The vaccine arrival process is a critical stage in the management of the supply chain; this is when ownership of the vaccine is transferred from the vaccine supplier to the ministry of health. Vaccines purchased through United Nations agencies will automatically be accompanied by the correct types of shipping indicator. If vaccines are purchased directly from the vaccine manufacturer, the procurement tender should specifically require the appropriate indicators. Further details and advice can be found in the WHO Guidelines on the international packaging and shipping of vaccines.24 Generally there will be 24 Guidelines on the international packaging and shipping of vaccines (WHO/IVB/05.23). Geneva: World Health Organization; 2005 ( http:/ /www.who.int/immunization/ documents/WHO_IVB_05.23/en/index.html , accessed 31 March 2015). one indicator per shipping carton supplied and activated by the vaccine manufacturer. Two different technologies are used as described below; both are single use. yCold chain monitor (CCM) cards (see Figure 3) are only used for international shipment of OPV packed with dry ice.25 They have no other function. Cumulative exposure to temperatures up to +34\u00b0C is indicated by blue staining along the length of the white indicator strip marked A, B, C. Exposure to a single event above +34\u00b0C is indicated by blue staining of the white dot in section D of the indicator. The shipping details are recorded on the card itself by the manufacturer at the point of dispatch and by the receiving store at the point of arrival. 25 CCM cards are used because electronic shipping indicators are damaged by exposure to dry ice temperatures unless they have a remote sensor (technology which exists but has yet to be prequalified). Figure 3. Cold chain monitor card yElectronic shipping indicators (see Figure 4) record the temperature at time intervals of 10 minutes or less for up to 20 days. They have digital displays and pre-set alarm thresholds to reflect the heat and/or freeze sensitivity of the vaccine being shipped. Some brands are able to download the temperature data to a computer. VMH-E2: How to monitor temperatures in the vaccine supply chain10 Figure 4. Electronic shipping indicators Q-Tag\u00ae VaxAlert Q-Tag\u00ae 2 plus LogTag\u00ae TIC20 Shipping indicators are mounted on a card with a data entry section on one side, which the manufacturer fills in at the point of dispatch, and an instruction and interpretation section on the reverse side for the recipient. The indicator and the card are coloured yellow or blue. Yellow indicators are for freeze-sensitive vaccines, and blue indicators are for heat-sensitive vaccines. In addition there are two vaccine-specific indicators, one for Prevnar 7 and 13 (yellow card) and another for RotaTeq \u00ae (blue card). These special indicators have product-specific alarm thresholds26 and must not be used with other vaccines. 26 For example, RotaTeq\u00ae is damaged by freezing at or below -25\u00b0C.When a shipment is received, the CCM cards are inspected for colour changes or the electronic devices are stopped and shipment temperature data is read directly from the display or downloaded onto a computer.27 The data will show the length of the journey and will indicate whether any pre-set alarms have been triggered. This enables recipient countries to determine whether shipments have been exposed to excessively high or low temperatures; it also helps the procurement agency to determine when, where and to what extent temperature limits have been exceeded. The results of this check are recorded on a standard vaccine arrival report as described in EVM-SOP-E1-02 Vaccine arrival procedures .28 27 Introduction of electronic temperature monitoring devices for international vaccine shipments and refrigerators [website]. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2013 ( http:/ / www.who.int/immunization_standards/vaccine_quality/10day_temp_device/en/ , accessed 31 March 2015). 28 Standard Operating Procedures are available at: http:/ /www.who.int/ immunization/programmes_systems/supply_chain/evm/en/index2.htmlVMH-E2: How to monitor temperatures in the vaccine supply chain11 3.4 Monitoring in primary and subnational stores Primary and subnational stores hold vaccine stocks that are valuable and in some cases worth millions of US dollars, making their loss catastrophic. Use of continuous temperature monitoring and recording devices is, therefore, essential. Primary and subnational stores are typically equipped with a mix of cold rooms, freezer rooms, vaccine refrigerators and/or vaccine freezers. The following continuous temperature monitoring and recording devices are used in primary and subnational settings: Chart recorders have traditionally been used as continuous temperature recording devices for cold rooms and freezer rooms. WHO no longer recommends the use of chart recorders because they are prone to mechanical failure. In addition, the charts and pens are often, in practice, not changed as required, and chart data cannot be stored and interrogated electronically. Programmable electronic temperature and event logger systems are the best option for primary and subnational stores. Temperature sensors should be placed in every cold room, freezer room, vaccine refrigerator or vaccine freezer in the store and directly linked to a central computer-based monitoring point via wired or wireless connections. Central data storage allows temperature records to be analysed electronically, and the system can be configured to produce periodic reports. This is much more efficient than a manual review process. Event logger systems can also be configured with sensors which monitor door openings as well as other performance characteristics such as relative humidity and voltage fluctuations. Such systems should also be equipped with local audible alarms and/or alarm strobes and configured to send alerts to responsible staff via auto-dialer, email and SMS- enabled devices when temperatures and other parameters are outside predefined limits. Internet or intranet connectivity options are also available; these allow for remote monitoring and alarm reporting from multiple sites on a national basis. Figure 5 illustrates a typical schematic for some of the options described above. Each sensor should record data at least six times per hour, and all records of data and alarm events should be stored for a minimum of three years and be easy to access. Figure 5. Schematic of a programmable electronic temperature and event logger system Optional web-enabled secured monitoring systemPC (on as required) PrimerAlarm'Active' base station with memory & battery backup. Always on.Auto-dialerLogger unit(with or without alarm)Remote sensor option Logger unit with internal sensor (with or without alarm)Cold/freezer room or refrigerator/freezerCold/freezer room or refrigerator/freezer A characteristic of all multi-sensor event logger systems is that they require site-specific configuration, installation and commissioning. In particular, temperature sensors should be located at points representing high and low temperature extremes; these points should be established by temperature mapping at the time of installation.29 29 See: Category documentation catdocumentation.aspx?id_cat=15 , accessed 30 March 2015).VMH-E2: How to monitor temperatures in the vaccine supply chain12 Note: Wireless sensors and audible alarms are generally battery powered. Base-station units typically have a rechargeable battery backup to cover mains power failures. All batteries must be replaced at regular intervals. In addition, some systems are recalibrated by replacing the temperature-sensor heads at predefined intervals. In order for programmable electronic temperature and event logger systems to continue to function reliably, it is essential that countries make arrangements to fund, procure and replace critical components as part of their routine preventive maintenance and recalibration programmes. All cold rooms and freezer rooms require a reliable backup device to monitor temperatures in case the event logger system fails. Integrated digital thermometers are often built into the refrigeration units, but these devices require a power source. The only fail-safe option is a fixed gas/vapour pressure-dial thermometer because it does not require a power supply (see Figure 6). In addition, 30-day electronic temperature recorders and electronic freeze indicators are sometimes used for backup. This is acceptable. However, these devices should NEVER be used to replace a programmable electronic temperature and event logger system of the type described above, and their routine use to locate hot and cold spots in a cold room is NOT a substitute for a properly conducted temperature mapping exercise.Figure 6. Fixed gas/vapour pressure-dial thermometer 3.5 Monitoring in small subnational and district stores and health facilities Small subnational and district stores typically have one or more vaccine refrigerators and, maybe, a vaccine freezer. Health facilities are often equipped with a single vaccine refrigerator. Table 5 sets out the temperature monitoring options in these settings in order of preference. Table 5. Temperature monitoring options in smaller stores and health facilities Option Vaccine refrigerator Vaccine freezer (if available) Option A: Best practice y30-day electronic temperature recorder (also referred to as 30 DTR) yStem thermometer backup yIntegrated digital thermometer yVaccine Option yIntegrated digital thermometer yVVMs yNot applicable Not recommended yStem thermometer or bimetallic dial thermometer alone yVVMs yNot applicable The characteristics, uses and limitations of each of these temperature monitoring devices are described below. 30-day electronic temperature recorders (30 DTRs): These stand-alone devices are placed with the vaccine load in a vaccine refrigerator; they log the refrigerator temperature at 10-minute intervals or less for 30 consecutive days on a rolling basis. They also record and display a 30-day history of any heat and freeze alarm violations that have occurred. Alarms are triggered if the temperature in the refrigerator drops to -0.5\u00b0C or below for 60 minutes or if it exceeds +8\u00b0C for a continuous period of 10 hours. As long as the temperature has remained within the recommended range, the device displays OK or a tick symbol (see Figure 7). On newer models, data can also be downloaded to a computer via a USB (universal serial bus) interface. 30 DTRs are not designed to be used in vaccine freezers. Current models have built-in batteries with a battery alarm feature; the device must be discarded and replaced when the battery expires. Note: 30 DTRs are battery powered. These devices contain a non-replaceable battery with a minimum operating life of 2 years from the date of activation. The device must be activated within 12 months of receipt in storage. It is essential that countries make arrangements to fund, procure and replace 30 DTRs as part of their routine preventive maintenance programme. VMH-E2: How to monitor temperatures in the vaccine supply chain13 Figure 7. 30-day electronic temperature recorders Fridge-tag2 with USB30LogTag\u00ae vaxtag31 30 DTRs should be placed in an accessible position where they can easily be read and are unlikely to be damaged. This will vary depending on the type of refrigerator. Try to observe the following rules: yIf the refrigerator is used to store vaccines that are not freeze sensitive, place the 30 DTR on top of the load in the warmest part of the refrigerator. yIf the refrigerator is used to store any freeze-sensitive vaccines, place the 30 DTR with the freeze-sensitive vaccines. The device should preferably be placed in the coldest part of the refrigerator that is being used to store these vaccines. This will be the bottom of a basket in chest refrigerators or nearest to the evaporator plate in front-opening models and absorption units. For example, if an ice-lined refrigerator at the subnational level is being used for bulk storage of a freeze- sensitive vaccine, the 30 DTR should be placed at the bottom of the lowest basket containing this vaccine. However, there are practical issues to consider. It is essential that the device is accessible for reading. Therefore, it may be necessary to place the 30 DTR on top of the load in the basket. Alternatively, attach a cord to the device, tie the cord to the basket and lower the 30 DTR into the space between the vaccine load and the side of the basket. The device can then be lifted out for reading without risk of it being lost. yWhere 30 DTRs are used, always use these devices for the twice-daily temperature readings 30 For more information on Fridge-tag2, see Berlinger's YouTube channel for setup and user guides (available in English, French and Russian): https:/ /www.youtube. com/channel/UCrB2 -oxAPaxvKb4SCSjBveg Note that electronic freeze indicators are NOT needed in refrigerators in which a 30 DTR is used Several types of 30 DTRs are prequalified by WHO. Purchasing decisions should take the following factors into consideration\u2014 some of these features are not yet available but may be offered in future: ybattery life;32 yavailability of a USB connection (allows reports to be generated if a computer is available); yneed for software or docking station to download data; ySMS functionality (allows for remote monitoring and alarm alerts); yease of use and training needed. Electronic freeze indicators: These are small digital devices that are placed with freeze-sensitive vaccines during transport or storage (see Figure 8). The devices have a visual indicator that shows whether the vaccine has been exposed to freezing temperatures. Once the alarm indicator is triggered, the device is no longer usable and should be discarded. Otherwise the device can be used until the built-in battery expires. 31 For more information on LogTag\u00ae vaxtag, see the setup guide on Youtube: https:/ / www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2PgEukFkFDs 32 Current models have non-replaceable batteries. The potential of models with replaceable batteries is under review by WHO.VMH-E2: How to monitor temperatures in the vaccine supply chain14 Figure 8. Electronic freeze indicators FreezeAlert Q-Tag\u00ae Quad Freeze-tag\u00ae Integrated digital thermometers: The current range of prequalified vaccine refrigerators and freezers are equipped with these devices (see Figure 9). An internal temperature sensor monitors the coldest point in the vaccine storage compartment, and an instantaneous temperature reading is displayed on the unit's control panel. Solar direct-drive refrigerators typically have a device powered by an integrated photovoltaic cell\u2014these do not work at night or in dim light and may have to be activated by a flashlight. Figure 9. Integrated digital thermometer Source: Dulas Solar Stem thermometers: These devices only provide an instantaneous temperature reading. For this reason, WHO no longer recommends them as the primary monitoring device in vaccine refrigerators. They remain useful as a backup device because they do not require a power source. In addition, stem thermometers should continue to be used as the primary temperature monitoring device in vaccine freezers which are not connected to a programmable electronic temperature and event logger system. WHO no longer recommends bimetallic dial thermometers for any purpose because they lose their calibration over time, especially if they are dropped. 3.6 Monitoring transport temperatures Poorly managed and monitored transport operations place vaccine at particular risk of damage from exposure to heat and freezing temperatures. If vaccines have VVMs, heat damage can be detected by monitoring VVM changes. However, if no temperature monitoring devices are used, it is impossible to detect freeze damage. Table 6 shows transport monitoring options in order of preference. For cold boxes and vaccine carriers, the best practice options depend on the type of vaccine being transported (freeze sensitive or not freeze sensitive) and also the type of coolant pack used in the container. The warm- water pack option only applies in very cold climates where freeze-sensitive vaccines have to be protected against exposure to sub-zero ambient temperatures.

Temperature monitoring options during transport operations using cold boxes and vaccine carriers OptionCold boxes and vaccine carriers Comments With freeze-sensitive vaccinesWithout freeze- sensitive vaccines Option A: Best yVaccine types yVVMs only yThe use of electronic freeze indicators depends on the type of coolant pack used and the type of vaccine being carried. These devices must be used whenever freeze-sensitive vaccine is transported with conditioned ice-packs or when warm- water packs are used to protect these vaccines from sub-zero ambient temperatures. They are not needed when freeze- sensitive vaccine is transported with cool-water packs, and they are not required if there are no freeze-sensitive vaccines in the load. Not recommendedConditioned ice-packs yVVMs only yNot applicable yIf freeze-sensitive vaccines are transported with conditioned ice-packs, there is always a risk of freeze damage occurring because ice-packs may not have been conditioned correctly. For this reason it is essential to include an electronic freeze indicator. Table 7 contains temperature monitoring options for transport by refrigerated vehicles. Table 7. Temperature monitoring options for transport by refrigerated vehicles Option Refrigerated vehicle Comments Option A: Best practice yDashboard-mounted electronic temperature recorder with integrated printer yVVMs yMobile programmable electronic temperature and event logger systems33 can be installed in refrigerated vehicles. These are equivalent to the event logger systems used for fixed storage locations and have similar functionality options, including multi-point temperature monitoring and a dashboard- mounted display and alarm system. The more sophisticated models can be integrated with Internet- or intranet-based vehicle tracking and remote monitoring, including SMS event alerts and local wireless area data retrieval. Option B yData logger or electronic temperature recorder yVVMs yOne or more user programmable temperature loggers can be packed with the load, and the temperature history can be downloaded at the end of the trip. This option can provide a continuous temperature and alarm record for traceability purposes but cannot alert the driver if a temperature excursion occurs. Option C yDashboard-mounted digital thermometer manually recorded hourly yFreeze indicator yVVMs yA dashboard-mounted digital thermometer does not provide a continuous temperature record for traceability purposes and the driver may not notice if a temperature excursion occurs. Moreover, the thermometer sensor only monitors temperatures at a single point in a compartment with a volume of many cubic metres. Traceability relies entirely on checking and recording the freeze indicator and VVM status at the point of delivery. Manually recording temperatures at regular intervals is a possibility; however, this can only be done in a safe and reliable manner if the driver is accompanied by a member of the EPI team. Not recommended yFreeze indicator alone yVVMs yThe driver has no knowledge of the load temperatures over the course of the journey, and traceability relies entirely on checking and recording the freeze indicator and VVM status at the point of delivery. 33 At the time of publication, WHO PQS does not have specifications for this category of equipment.VMH-E2: How to monitor temperatures in the vaccine supply chain16 Guidance on specifying and procuring refrigerated vehicles, including on-board temperature monitoring equipment, can be found in section E002 of the PDF version of the WHO PQS catalogue. Further guidance on temperature qualification of these vehicles can be found in the technical supplement: Qualification of temperature controlled road vehicles.34 Figure 10 shows a cab-mounted logger unit with an integrated thermal printer option. The printout provides a hard-copy arrival record for the receiving store and shows the vaccine's transport temperature history. Figure 10 .

Geneva: World Health Organization; 2014 ( http:/ /www.who.int/medicines/areas/quality_safety/quality_ assurance/en/ , accessed 31 March 2015).VMH-E2: How to monitor temperatures in the vaccine supply chain17 Accurate and comprehensive temperature records are a key component of good storage and distribution practices. However, records alone are of no value unless they are actively used for management and quality assurance purposes. Active use of records shows whether vaccines are systematically being exposed to damaging temperatures and enables equipment performance problems to be identified and addressed. Wherever possible, the process of recording temperature data should be automatic. The devices described in section 3 are mostly designed to achieve this. Once collected, the data must be stored in a systematic manner so that they can easily be accessed. Paper-based temperature charts and chart- recorder disks should be filed in date order and by appliance. Electronic records should be similarly filed either on a computer supplemented by regular backups or on a secure server. Collected data must be analysed and reviewed regularly in order to establish whether key performance indicators (KPIs) are being met. When a problem is identified, there must be specific and appropriate action to maintain or repair the equipment. 4.1 Temperature recording Table 8 describes the recommended manual temperature recording tasks and indicates when they should be done. It is important to carry out these tasks even when automatic recording devices are used. Although electronic records provide a complete temperature history, manual checking and recording remains the best way to demonstrate that cold chain equipment status is actively being observed and monitored. In case temperature excursions occur, it is important that staff have access to SOPs to help resolve simple issues or to request maintenance from a technician if needed. A record of maintenance activities must be kept. Table 8.

(2) Where there is more than one device in the refrigerator or freezer, expect each device to give slightly different readings. If two devices are available and serve the same purpose (e.g. an integrated digital thermometer and gas/vapour pressure-dial thermometer), use the same device consistently for temperature recording. In fixed storage locations, manual temperature record charts should be displayed on the door of each piece of cold chain equipment, labelled with the equipment's name or unique identification. Temperature graphs are preferable to tables because they clearly show trends away from the normal pattern of daily fluctuation. This helps staff to identify performance issues before alarms are generated. Examples of temperature recording forms are shown in Annex 3 . 4.2 Temperature data reporting and management Temperature data should be included in the existing monthly reporting procedure. At each supply chain level, supervisors should aggregate and analyse these data and generate a report that includes KPIs on supply chain and equipment performance; these KPIs can be used to guide decision-making. As they become more widely available, Internet, email and SMS data transmission technologies should simplify and enhance this process. Monthly reports for cold rooms, freezer rooms, refrigerators and freezers should include: ythe number of high and low alarm events per month for each piece of equipment. Where equipment is not fitted with an alarm device, record the number of temperature excursions outside the range +2 \u00b0C to +8\u00b0C for refrigerated storage and -15\u00b0C to -25\u00b0C for frozen storage; ya record of the number of doses and types of vaccine discarded due to heat exposure (as indicated by VVMs at or beyond the discard point), due to freeze damage (as indicated by shake-test failure) and due to breakage or expiry. Also record the storage location(s) where the vaccine losses occurred; ya list of actions taken to address alarm events and cold chain equipment failures during the current reporting period. Monthly reports for transport should include: ythe number of high and low alarm events per month and the distance travelled for each refrigerated vehicle equipped with electronic event loggers or user programmable temperature loggers; ythe number of freeze indicators triggered by low-temperature exposure for each refrigerated vehicle not equipped with logger devices; ythe number of freeze indicators triggered by low-temperature exposure in cold boxes and/or vaccine carriers; ya record of the number of doses and types of vaccine discarded due to heat exposure (as indicated by VVMs at or beyond the discard point), due to freeze damage (as indicated by shake- test failure) and due to breakage and expiry. Also record the arrival location(s) where the vaccine losses occurred; ya list of actions taken to address these failures during the reporting period. All reports should be reviewed and signed by senior supervisors or managers and kept for at least three years either on paper or electronically. Feedback should be given in a supportive way to help deal with problems and create incentives for ongoing reporting, maintenance, training and repair. In addition, the feedback on temperature monitoring should be linked to feedback on equipment performance and maintenance.VMH-E2: How to monitor temperatures in the vaccine supply chain19 WHO strongly encourages countries to carry out temperature monitoring, temperature mapping and route profiling studies because they identify problems and provide the basis for making evidence-based improvements in cold chain quality. 5.1 Devices used for study purposes User programmable temperature loggers (see Figure 11 for examples) are the principal tool for conducting cold chain temperature monitoring studies, for transport route profiling and for temperature mapping in cold rooms, freezer rooms and refrigerated vehicles. Currently prequalified models are affordable and user-friendly and can be used several times. The user can define alarm thresholds, set the frequency of temperature recordings and programme start and stop times. At the end of the study, data can be downloaded to a computer for analysis. Most models have built-in batteries (when the battery expires the device is discarded); others have replaceable batteries and can be reused. Figure 11 . User programmable temperature loggers Libero CB MonitorDeltaTrak FlashLink.USB certified data logger 5.2 Temperature mapping All cold rooms, freezer rooms and refrigerated vehicles should be temperature mapped during initial equipment installation (see section 5.2.1)36 and whenever future changes are made to the organization or layout of the storage space or to the cooling equipment. Temperatures can vary significantly from place to place, and mapping locates the hot spots and cold spots. Only when the temperature distribution in the space is known can users can be sure that vaccines are always kept in the right 36 See also: Qualification of temperature-controlled storage areas (technical supplement to WHO Technical Report Series, No. 961, 2011, Annex 9). Geneva: World Health Organization; 2014 ( http:/ /www.who.int/medicines/areas/quality_ safety/quality_assurance/en/ , accessed 31 March 2015).places based on their sensitivity to heat and freezing. Where appropriate, refrigerators may also need to be temperature mapped (see section 5.2.3). 5.2.1 Mapping cold rooms and freezer rooms A simple protocol for mapping cold rooms and freezer rooms is available in the relevant WHO PQS verification protocol.37 In addition, a forthcoming WHO technical supplement, Temperature mapping of storage areas , will provide guidance for mapping temperature-controlled stores, cold rooms and freezer rooms of 37 PQS quality assurance protocol: Cold rooms and freezer rooms\u2014guidance section (WHO/PQS/E001/CR-FR01-VP2.3). Geneva: World Health Organization; 2012. catdocumentation.aspx?id_cat=15 30 March 2015).5. Temperature monitoring and mapping studiesVMH-E2: How to monitor temperatures in the vaccine supply chain20 any size. WHO recommends that countries should not accept a new cold room or freezer room from an installer until it has been fully mapped as part of the commissioning procedure. Vaccines should not be stored in the room until the temperature mapping exercise has been completed and the results have been analysed to identify and address performance gaps. 5.2.2 Mapping refrigerated vehicles Another forthcoming WHO technical supplement, Qualification of temperature-controlled road vehicles, will provide guidance on the commissioning of refrigerated vehicles.38 It is just as important to locate and avoid hot and cold spots in these vehicles as it is in a cold room. Because they operate on the open road, refrigerated vehicles are exposed to the full range of annual ambient temperatures, and testing should reflect these extremes. 5.2.3 Mapping refrigerators WHO recommends that only prequalified refrigerators be purchased as they are designed specifically for vaccine storage. The temperature distribution in WHO-prequalified refrigerators is established during laboratory testing, and the manufacturers provide design features which help ensure that vaccine is stored in the safe temperature storage zone. WHO does not recommend the use of domestic refrigerators, but, if they are used, temperature mapping helps to identify the safest areas for vaccine storage. 38 Qualification of temperature-controlled road vehicles and Temperature mapping of storage areas are among the technical supplements to WHO Technical Report Series, No. 961, 2011, Annex 9. 5.3 Temperature monitoring studies Studies in both industrialized and developing countries have revealed that vaccines are commonly exposed to damaging temperatures, especially exposure to sub-zero temperatures.39 The simplest way to identify these risks is to conduct a systematic temperature monitoring study of the entire vaccine supply chain designed to identify and locate sources of damaging temperature exposure. Guidance on how to carry out a study of this kind is given in the WHO document Study protocol for temperature monitoring in the vaccine cold chain.40 Completion of such a study is a critical indicator in an EVM assessment; it should be repeated at least once every five years, preferably more frequently. Temperature monitoring studies can be used to establish a baseline against which to monitor improvements. They can also be used to validate data being reported through routine temperature monitoring. 5.4 Qualifying transport routes The temperature monitoring protocol described in section 5.3 can be modified to validate transport routes. Route qualification is strongly recommended on higher-risk routes where: yvaccines are routinely exposed to extreme ambient temperatures, either high, low or both; yjourney time exceeds the capacity of currently used cold boxes or vaccine carriers to maintain the recommended temperatures; ythe route has multiple drop-off points; yjourney time is likely to be lengthened by poor weather, poor road conditions or unforeseen events such as vehicle breakdown. When these risks exist, route qualification is recommended to ensure that vaccines are maintained at the correct temperature ranges during transport. The process typically involves monitoring worst-case routes in order to ensure that the chosen equipment and packaging arrangements are able to maintain acceptable transport temperatures even in such cases. Route qualification data can also be used to test alternative passive container packouts under laboratory-controlled conditions (see the companion VMH module, How to use passive containers and coolant packs for vaccine transport and outreach operations and the technical supplement to WHO Technical Report Series, No. 961, 2011, Annex 9, Transport route profiling qualification ). 39 Matthias DM, Robertson J, Garrison MM, Newland S, Nelson C.

Vaccine. 2007;25(20):3980-6. 40 Study protocol for temperature monitoring in the vaccine cold chain (WHO/IVB/ 05.01 accessed 31 March 2015).VMH-E2: How to monitor temperatures in the vaccine supply chain21 All staff responsible for vaccine management should know when and how to respond in the event of an emergency related to a cold chain equipment breakdown, a major power supply failure, a transport emergency or any other situation that puts vaccine at risk. Managers and storekeepers should develop facility- and equipment-specific contingency plans that clearly describe the steps and actions to take in response to common emergencies. This is essential at primary and subnational store levels where large quantities of vaccine are kept but is also advisable in lower-level stores and health facilities. Every facility that delivers or collects vaccine should also develop a transport contingency plan so that staff know what to do in the event of a transport emergency. Contingency plans should be in the form of a written checklist, easily accessible to all relevant staff. Contingency plans should be treated like fire drills\u2014it is good practice to rehearse the listed procedures at regular intervals so that store personnel know exactly what to do if a real event occurs. 6.1 Content of a contingency plan The detailed content of a contingency plan will be site and equipment specific. However, the following key elements are universal: ytrain all personnel to observe the basic emergency safe storage rule\u2014ensure that all affected vaccines are placed in a +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C environment as soon as possible; yidentify a range of emergency response options\u2014it is essential to identify alternative locations where vaccines can safely be stored or where ice can be obtained at short notice; yprepare and maintain at least two emergency response plans based on these options; ypost emergency contact details where they can be accessed at all times; yclearly describe initial and follow-up actions that can be implemented both inside and outside working hours; yreview the plan at least once a year to ensure that it is still valid. The following is a typical sequence of emergency actions at a fixed storage location: ylocate the source of the alarm or problem; yidentify the root cause of the alarm or problem. If possible, rectify immediately; yif the problem cannot be immediately rectified, safeguard the vaccine by following the basic safe storage rule; yonce the emergency situation has been stabilized, check to see if any vaccines have been damaged: xheat exposure: check the VVM status of the vaccines, especially the most heat-sensitive vaccines (e.g. OPV); xfreeze exposure: conduct the shake test with vaccines that are freeze sensitive. yif vaccine damage is suspected, label the vaccines as damaged or potentially damaged and quarantine them at the appropriate storage temperature (+2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C) so that they are not distributed until a final decision has been taken on disposal or use. If damage is confirmed, the vaccines can be taken out of the cold chain once approval to do so has been obtained; ydocument the emergency event. Complete the appropriate reports and inform the supervisor who will decide what follow- up action is to be taken (depends on volume of vaccine).6. Responding to emergenciesVMH-E2: How to monitor temperatures in the vaccine supply chain22 7. Recalibrating sensors and devices Some temperature monitoring devices and the control sensors for refrigeration units have to be recalibrated periodically in order to verify their accuracy over their full operating temperature range. Without regular calibration, the temperature readings and temperature control of these devices and sensors gradually lose accuracy; this can lead to a false sense of security, place vaccines at risk and create unnecessary alarms. Disposable devices, such as 30 DTRs, are covered by calibration certificates from the device manufacturer. These certificates are valid for a defined period of time, and the associated devices may be used throughout this period without additional calibration. The list below describes some of the circumstances in which a calibration check is required: yregulatory bodies require regular proof of calibration\u2014for example, at 12-month intervals; ythe device manufacturer specifies that a calibration procedure should be carried out at regular intervals; ythe device has been in use beyond the end date of the manufacturer's original calibration certificate; ya calibration certificate is not available because it has been lost; ythe device has been subjected to temperatures or physical abuse exceeding the limits stated on the manufacturer's data sheet limitations; ythe device's battery has been replaced; ythe device's measurements are suspect. WHO recommends that temperature monitoring devices and control sensors that are designed for recalibration be calibrated against a certified, traceable reference standard at least once a year unless otherwise justified. Note that some products include disposable plug-in sensors. This type of device is recalibrated by replacing the sensor with a new factory-calibrated and certified unit. A simple ice-water bath calibration procedure is described in the forthcoming WHO technical supplement, Calibration of temperature control and monitoring devices.41 41 Calibration of temperature control and monitoring devices. Technical supplement (to be made available soon) to WHO Technical Report Series, No. 961, 2011, Annex 9.VMH-E2: How to monitor temperatures in the vaccine supply chain23 8. Training and supervision 8.1 Training It is essential that temperature monitoring is not a purely mechanical exercise. Responsible staff must know how to react effectively to problems as soon as they arise. The new generation of temperature monitoring devices are powerful and sophisticated, but they are also becoming more complex. The WHO web page, Introduction of electronic temperature monitoring devices for international vaccine shipments and refrigerators, contains links to training materials and videos showing how to use these devices.42 Whenever a new device is introduced, it is essential to allow adequate time for initial training. Most staff, especially at the service level, will only need to know how to read a device and how to respond to alarms. However, it is important that at least one supervisor at every level in the supply chain, down to district level, understands how to initiate, programme and troubleshoot all the device types for which they are responsible. It is equally important to schedule regular refresher courses to take account of staff turnover and to make sure that knowledge stays up to date; such training can be done in conjunction with other scheduled training courses. 42 Introduction of electronic temperature monitoring devices for international vaccine shipments and refrigerators [website]. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2013 (http:/ /www.who.int/immunization_standards/vaccine_quality/10day_temp_ device/en/ 31 March 2015). 8.2 Supervision National- and subnational-level immunization programme managers can only ensure the reliability of vaccine supply chains if they are knowledgeable and actively involved in temperature monitoring. A detailed checklist for managers is provided in Annex 4. All supervision visits should include a review of temperature monitoring equipment and temperature records. The supervisor should make sure that devices are being used correctly, should provide supportive supervision to improve staff knowledge and should ensure that SOPs are followed and necessary actions taken. Prompt review of temperature records can help prevent vaccine wastage. In addition, regular data reviews can identify equipment failures or other problems. During each supervision visit, the supervisor should do the following: yconfirm that the right device is being used and that it is correctly positioned in the cold chain equipment; yconfirm that the device is working. If the battery light on an electronic device is flashing, either the battery or the device itself will need to be replaced within the next month; yverify that the manual temperature records are complete and have been filled in correctly. Confirm that the paper records match the device records and that they are being filed in chronological order and by appliance name or code; ycheck that the VVMs on the vaccines are not at the discard point; yverify that a contingency plan is available in case of equipment or transport emergencies. Asking the following questions will help to verify whether staff knowledge is adequate: yhow do staff respond when an alarm is triggered? Are they following the correct steps? ywhat do staff do in case of power, equipment or transport failure? Do they know the contingency plan? At the end of the visit, develop a follow-up plan to deal with identified issues, for example: low batteries, problems with equipment, lack of staff knowledge, etc. VMH-E2: How to monitor temperatures in the vaccine supply chain24 yChen D, Tyagi A, Carpenter J, Perkins S, Sylvester D, Guy M, et al.

All temperature monitoring devices should comply with WHO PQS specifications for temperature monitoring devices .44 A2.2 Procurement methods Two methods are routinely used to procure vaccines and cold chain equipment: pooled and self-procurement. Pooled procurement combines several buyers into a single entity that purchases on behalf of those buyers. UNICEF Supply Division (SD)45 and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)46 Revolving Fund are the two major pooled procurement agencies. UNICEF SD offers specific commercial and technical guidance and references for ordering temperature monitoring devices.47 This service is provided through the UNICEF Cold Chain Country Support Package .48 Information on the list of UNICEF SD- available temperature monitoring devices can also be accessed using the UNICEF web-based supply catalogue under the cold chain equipment section and thermometers/indicators subsection. The PAHO Revolving Fund is a cooperation mechanism for the joint procurement of vaccines, syringes and related supplies for countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Countries can also self-procure temperature monitoring devices. The procurement cycle in modern businesses usually includes the following steps: identification of need, supplier identification, supplier communication, tender notification, negotiation, supplier liaison and logistics management, supplier preparation, expediting, shipment, delivery and payment based on contract terms. Installation and training may also be included. A2.3 Inspection, performance feedback and complaint handling It is important to conduct an arrival inspection of procured temperature monitoring devices. There should be a visual inspection of a sample of the consignment to check compliance with purchasing specifications and to detect any gross abnormalities. This process reinforces quality assurance. 44 Immunization standards - E006: Temperature monitoring devices page. WHO website. Available at: http:/ /www.who.int/immunization_standards/vaccine_ quality/pqs_prequalified_devices_e06/en/index.html , accessed 1 December 2014. 45 logistics page. UNICEF website.

New York: UNICEF. Available http:/ /www.unicef.org/supply/index_74631.html . http:/ /www.unicef. org/supply/index_68367.html , accessed 1 December 2014.It is equally important to provide written feedback on any problems encountered with temperature monitoring devices; this helps ensure that problems are resolved and that products can be improved in the future. If temperature monitoring devices fail to perform according to their specifications, the customer should log a complaint with the procurement agency from which the product was purchased. The customer should inform WHO of any problem with prequalified products to ensure that prompt and adequate remedial action is taken. This can be done either by using the feedback form found on the PQS website49 or by sending a message to pqsinfo@who.int . The complaint should include a detailed description of the problem, information on where the problem occurred and information on when the problem occurred. In turn, the complaint handler should conduct a root cause analysis and take corrective action. Positive feedback on temperature monitoring devices is also important as the information is useful for understanding what features to keep in future products and for steering other purchasers towards the best available devices. A2.4 Distribution, replacement and disposal of single-use devices As they become more affordable, single-use electronic devices (such as 30-day temperature recorders, electronic freeze indicators and user programmable temperature loggers) are increasingly being used by countries. However, these devices have a limited lifespan\u2014typically two to four years; this means that replacement stock needs to be ordered regularly and units must be distributed for facility use and for training. In order to maximize battery life, the devices should be stored in a cool place, between +5\u00b0C and +25\u00b0C, and stocks must be managed in the same way as other products with an expiry date; they should be distributed on an earliest expiry first out (EEFO) basis. Plans also need to be in place for the safe disposal of used devices. Ideally they should be recycled in accordance with local regulations because they contain valuable materials, some of which may be toxic. Electronic devices marketed in the European Union will generally carry the symbol shown below which indicates that the product should not be sent to a landfill. 49 See: http:/ /apps.who.int/immunization_standards/vaccine_quality/pqs_ catalogue/feedbackform.aspx .

Duty staff did not know that HepB freezes at -0.5\u00b0C, so they ignored the sub-zero temperatures on 1st and 2nd June and only notified the storekeeper that there was a problem on 3rd June. The cold room has not yet been fitted with a temperature alarm, although this has been on order since April. No other problems were noted during the period. Recommendations: Duty staff should receive additional training in temperature monitoring. Until this has been done, the storekeeper should monitor temperatures each day. Temperature alarms should be fitted to cold rooms 1, 2 and 3 and to the three vaccine freezers before 21st June.

If more than one method was used during the period, enter all types used, e.g. T/30-day or Chart/Logger.Equipment type (Cold room, Freezer room, Refrigerator or Freezer)Make Model Unique IDVMH-E2: How to monitor temperatures in the vaccine supply chain31 Annex 4 - Checklist for managers and supervisors Below are the key checks to ensure vaccine effectiveness and minimize closed vial vaccine wastage. Any \"no\" answer represents a risk that should be addressed. Procurement yIs there a policy in place to purchase only World Health Organization-prequalified cold chain equipment? yIf vaccines are purchased directly from manufacturers, are requests for vaccine vial monitors on vaccines and electronic shipping indicators with shipments included in tenders? yAre recommended temperature monitoring devices being purchased in sufficient quantities for all cold chain storage and transport equipment, for training and for replacement? International shipping yAre temperature monitoring data read and recorded on standard vaccine arrival reports? Logistics and maintenance yIs temperature mapping successfully carried out for all newly purchased cold rooms and freezer rooms and when major components or storage arrangements change? yIs a temperature monitoring study carried out at least once every five years? yAre routes verified through temperature monitoring studies? yAre temperature monitoring devices properly maintained and calibrated at least once per year (if required)? yAre temperature monitoring devices with integrated batteries being distributed and activated in strict earliest expiry first out order so as to avoid premature expiry? yAre procedures in place for proper disposal and replacement of devices with integrated batteries following expiry, and are they being followed?Record-keeping and data management yAre temperature monitoring data read and recorded whenever vaccines are received? yAre temperatures read and recorded twice daily/seven times per week for every piece of cold chain equipment where vaccines are stored? yAre temperature records displayed outside every piece of cold chain equipment? yAre data on temperature excursions made available to the appropriate individuals so that issues can be investigated and resolved? yAre causes of vaccine wastage recorded and reviewed? yAre temperature monitoring data consolidated, retained (for three years) and reviewed at least monthly at district and national levels? Training and supervision yAre relevant standard operating procedures in place in all facilities and are staff trained in their use? yDo training sessions for health care workers and logisticians include information on: xThe heat sensitivities of vaccines and their correct storage temperatures? xThe risks of freezing, freeze prevention methods and how to recognize damaged vaccines through use of the shake test? xHow to use temperature monitoring devices? xHow to respond to temperature excursions or alarms? yAre training materials and sessions routinely updated to include information on new vaccines and new temperature monitoring devices? yAre supervisors providing feedback in a supportive way to help deal with problems and are there incentives for ongoing reporting, maintenance, training and repair? Emergencies and contingency plans yDoes each facility have contingency plans in place for handling vaccines in case of an emergency?EVM Setting a standard for the vaccine supply chain "}
