PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES The Rhode Island Medicaid Reform Act of 2008 (R.I.G.L \u00a742 -12.4) directed the state to apply for a global demonstration project under the authority of section 1115(a) of Title XI of the Social Security Act (the Act) to restructure the state's Medicaid program to establish a \"sustainable cost -effective, person- centered and opportunity driven program util izing competitive and value -based purchasing to maximize available service options\" and \"a results -oriented system of coordinated care.\" Toward this end, Rhode Island's Comprehensive demonstration establishes a new State- Federal compact that provides the State with substantially greater flexibility than is available under existing program guidelines. Rhode Island will use the additional flexibility afforded by the waiver to redesign the State's Medicaid program to provide cost -effective services that will ensure that beneficiaries receive the appropriate services in the least restrictive and most appropriate setting. Under this demonstration, Rhode Island operates its entire Medicaid program subject to the financial limitations of this section 1115 demo nstration project, with the exception of: 1) disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments; 2) administrative expenses; 3) phased- Part D contributions; and 4) payments to local education agencies (LEA) for services that are furnished only in a school -based setting, and for which there is no third party payer. With those four exceptions , all Medicaid funded services on the continuum of care - from preventive care in the home and community to care in high- intensity hospital settings to long -term and end -of life-care whether furnished under the approved state plan, or in accordance with waivers or Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 11 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 expenditure authorities granted under this demonstration or otherwise, are subject to the requirements of the demonstration. Rhode Island's previous section 1115 demonstration programs, RIte Care and RIte Share, were subsumed under this d emonstration, in addition to the state's previous section 1915(b) Dental Waiver and the state's previous section 1915(c) home and community -based services (HCBS) waivers. The Rhode Island Comprehensive demonstration includes the following distinct components: a. The Managed Care component provides Medicaid state plan benefits as well as supplemental benefits as identified in Attachment A to most recipients eligible under the Med icaid state plan, including the new adult group effective January 1, 2014. Benefits are provided through comprehensive mandatory managed care delivery systems. The amount, duration and scope of these services may vary and limitations must be set out in the state plan, these STCs, or in demonstration changes implemented using the processes described in section IV of these STCs. b. The Extended Family Planning component provides access to family planning and referrals to primary care services for women who se family income is at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level ( FPL), and who lose Medicaid eligibility under RIte Care at the conclusion of their 60- day postpartum period. Effective January 1, 2014, eligibility will be raised to 250 percent of the FPL. See Section IX for more detailed requirements. c. The RIte Share premium assistance component enrolls individuals who are eligible for Medicaid/CHIP, and who are employees or dependents of an employee of an employer that offers a \"qualified\" plan into the ESI coverage. d. Effective through December 31, 2013, the Rhody Health Partners component provides Medicaid state plan and demonstration benef its through a managed care delivery system to aged, blind, and disabled beneficiaries who have no other health insurance. Effective November 1, 2013, the Rhody Health Options and Connect Care Choice Community Partners component will expand to all qualified aged, blind, and disabled beneficiaries whether they have other health insurance or not. Effective January 1, 2014, the New Adult Group will be enrolled in Rhody Health Partners. The amount, duration, and scope of these services may vary and limitatio ns must be set out in the state plan, these STCs, or in demonstration changes implemented using the processes described in section IV of these STCs . e. The Connect Care Choice component provides Medicaid state plan benefits to aged, blind, and disabled benefi ciaries who have no other health insurance , through a primary care case management system. The amount, duration, and scope of these services may vary and limitations must be set out in the state plan, these STCs, or in demonstration changes implemented us ing the processes described in section IV of these STCs. f. The Home and Community -Based Service component provides services similar to those authorized under sections 1915(c) and 1915(i) of the Act to individuals who need home and community based services ei ther as an alternative to institutionalization or otherwise based on medical need. g. The RIte Smiles Program is a managed dental benefit program for Medicaid eligible children born after May 1, 2000. Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 12 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 h. Rhody Health Options is a managed care delivery system fo r Medicaid only and Medicare Medicaid eligibles that integrates acute and primary care and long term care services and supports. i. Connect Care Choice Community Partners is an optional delivery system for Adult, Blind and Disabled Medicaid and Medicare Medi caid eligibles that utilizes a community health team and a Coordinating Care Entity to integrate Medicaid benefits. In 2013, CMS renewed the Comprehensive demonstration through December 31, 2018. This renewal includes changes to support the state's implementation of the Affordable Care Act (including coverage of the new adult group for adults with incomes at or below 133 percent of the FPL), the expansion of the state's home and community based services (HCBS), and the conversion from an aggregate cap to a per member per month budget neutrality model. On October 20, 2016, CMS approved an amendment that provides for federal funding of designated state health programs (DSHPs) that promote healthcare workforce development to ensure access to trained healthcare professionals for eligible individuals. This DSHP funding will be phased down over the period of the demonstration, as the state develops alternative funding sources for these programs . The state submitted an amendment on May 17, 2016 that requested federal funding of DSHPs to ensure the continuation of workforce training and other vital health care programs while the state devotes increased state resources during the period of this demonstration to a \"Health System Transformation Project\" that will positively impact the Medicaid program. DSHP funding will be limited to the additional state funding attributable to the establishment of Accountable Care Entities through Medicaid managed care contracts, net of savings attributable to the operation of those entities and the costs associated with the Hospital and Nursing Hom e Incentive program . The Accountable Entities (AEs) will be responsible for improving the quality of care, and there will be Alternative Payment models established , between MCO health plans and AEs through the development of value -based contracts . The amou nt of DSHP funding will be phased down over the period of the demonstration as the implementation costs associated with AEs diminish and savings resulting from their operations reduce funding needs. III. GENERAL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS 1. Concurrent Operation. The state's title XIX state plan as approved; its title XXI state plan, as approved; and this Medicaid section 1115 demonstration entitled \"Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration ,\" will continue to operate concurrently for the demonstration period. 2.

Changes in Medicaid and C HIP Law, Regulation, and Policy. The state must, within the timeframes specified in law, regulation, or policy directive, come into compliance with any changes in Federal law, regulation, or policy affecting the Medicaid or CHIP programs that occur during this demonstration approval period, unless the provision being changed is expressly waived or identified as not applicable. 5. Impact on Demonstration of Changes in Federal Law, Regulation, and Policy Statements. a. To the extent that a change in Federal law, regulation, or policy requires either a reduction or an increase in Federal financial participation (FFP) for expenditures made under this demonstration, the state must adopt, subject to CMS approval, modified budget neutrality and allotment neutrality agreements for the demonstration as necessary to comply with the change. The modified agreements will be effective upon the implementation of the change. b. If mandated changes in the Federal law require state legislation, the changes must take effect on the day that the state legislation becomes effective, or on the last day such legislation was required to be in effect under the law. 6. State Plan Amendments. The state will not be required to submit title XIX or title XXI state plan amendments for programmatic changes affecting populations who would not be eligible under the state plan as of November 1, 2008 (state plan populations). Nor will the state be required to submit state plan amendments for programmatic changes that affect other populations and are d efined in STC 18 as Category I or Category II changes. The state will be required to submit either a state plan amendment or an amendment to the demonstration as applicable for Category III changes. Changes relating to disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments and coverage and payment of services furnished by local educational agencies (LEAs) require state plan amendments because these are excluded from the demonstration. Rhode Island will be re sponsible for submitting state plan amendments to bring into compliance provisions of the current state plan that are inconsistent with Federal law or policy . The state must obtain CMS approval of any changes to payment methodology within the State Plan or this Medicaid section 1115 demonstration prior to any changes the state would like to implement. 7.

TITLE XIX PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 18 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 Rhode Island has flexibility to make changes to its demonstration based on how the changes align with the categories defined below and the corresponding process in this Section paragraph 18, \"Process for Changes to the Demonstration.\" The categories of changes described below are for changes to the program as described in the STCs. Initiatives described in the STCs are approved upon approval of the demonstration. 18. Categories of Changes and General Requirements for Each Category. When making changes, the state must characterize the change in one of the three following categories below. CMS has 15 business days after receiving notification of the change (either informally for Category I or formally for Categories II and III) to notify the state of an incorrect characterization of a programmatic change. To the extent the state and CMS are unable to reach mutual agreement on the characterization of the pro grammatic change, the CMS characterization shall be binding and non- appealable as to the procedure to be followed. a. Category I Change. Is a change which is administrative in nature for which the state has current authority under the state plan or demonst ration, and which does not affect beneficiary eligibility, benefits, overall healthcare delivery systems, payment methodologies or cost sharing. The state must notify CMS of such changes either in writing or orally in the periodic review calls and update reports as specified in the General Reporting Section paragraphs 98 through 100. Implementation of these changes does not require approval by CMS. Examples of Category I changes include, but are not limited to: o Changes to the instruments used to determine the level of care. o Changes to the Ass essment and Coordination Organization Structure. o Changes to general operating procedures. o Changes to provider network methodologies (provider enrollment procedures, but not delivery system changes). o Changes to prior authorization procedures. o Adding any HCBS service that has a core definition in the Instructions/Technical Guidance under section1915(c) if the state intends to use the core definition. o Modifying an HCBS service definition to adopt the core definition. b. Category II Change. Is a change that co uld be made as a state plan amendment or through authority in sections 1915(b), 1915(c), 1915(i) or 1915(j) without any change in either the STCs, or the section 1115 waiver and expenditure authorities. These changes may affect benefit packages, overall healthcare delivery systems (including adding populations to managed care) , cost sharing levels, and post -eligibility contributions to the cost of care. Such changes do not, however, include changes that affect beneficiary eligibility (including changes to the level of spenddown eligibility). The state must comply with its existing state plan amendment public notice process prior to implementation. The state must also notify CMS in writing of Category II changes prior to implementation, and must furnish CMS with appropriate assurances and justification, that include, but are not limited to, the following: i. That the change is consistent with the protections to health and welfare as appropriate to title XIX of the Act, including justification; ii. That the change results in appropriate efficient and effective operation of the program, including justification and response to funding questions; Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 19 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 iii. That the changes would be permissible as a state Plan or section 1915 waiver amendment; and that the change is otherwise co nsistent with sections 1902, 1903, 1905, and 1906 of the Act , current Federal regulations, and CMS policy; and iv. Assessment of the cost of the change. CMS will not provide Federal matching funds for activities affected by unapproved but implemented Category II changes. Examples of Category II changes include, but are not limited to: o Changes to the ICF/ IDD, hospital, or nursing home level of care criteria that are applied prospectively (not to existing long term care or HCBS recipients); o Adding any HCBS ser vice for which the state intends to use a definition other than the core definition; the service definition must be included with the assurances; o Modifying any HCBS service definition, unless it is to adopt the core definition; o Adding an \"other\" HCBS servi ce that does not have a core definition; the service definition must be included with the assurances; o Removing any HCBS service that is at that time being used by any participants; o Change/modify or end RIte Share premium assistance options for otherwise eligible individuals; o Changes to payment methodologies for Medicaid covered services including, but not limited to, DRG payments to hospitals or acuity based payments to nursing homes; o Healthy Behaviors Incentives ; o Addition or elimination of optional state plan benefits; o Changes in the amount, duration, and scope of state plan benefits that do not affect the overall sufficiency of the benefit; o Benefit changes in accordance with the flexibility outlined in current Medicaid regulations, as amended on July 15, 2013 at 78 FR 42160 (and any subsequent amendments) ; o Cost-Sharing Changes up to the limits specified in Medicaid cost -sharing regulations published on July 15, 2013, unless otherwise define d in the STCs . c. Category III Change. Is a change requiring modifications to the current waiver or expenditure authorities including descriptive language within those authorities and the STCs, and any other change that is not clearly described within Categ ories I and II. In addition, a programmatic change may be categorized as a Category III change by the state to obtain reconsideration after unsuccessfully pursuing approval of the change under Category II. The state must comply with the section 1115 demonstration public notice process as described in paragraph 14 of these STCs. The state must notify CMS in writing of Category III changes, and submi t an amendment to the demonstration as described in paragraph 19, \"Process for Changes to the Demonstration.\" Category III changes shall not be implemented until after approval of the amendment by CMS. Examples of Category III changes: o All Eligibility Changes; o Changes in EPSDT; o Spend- down level changes; o Aggregate cost -sharing changes that are not consistent with Medicaid cost-sharing flexibility (wo uld exceed 5 percent of family income) in current Medicaid regulations ; Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 20 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 o Benefit changes that are not in accordance with current Medicaid regulations ; and o Post-eligibility treatment of income; and o Amendments requesting changes to the budget neutrality limits. 19. Process for Changes to the Demonstration. The state must submit the corresponding notification to CMS for any changes it makes to the demonstration as characterized in the Category I, II or III definitions section depending on the level of change. CM S will inform the state within 15 business days of any correction to the State's characterization of a change, which shall be binding and non -appealable as to the procedure for the change. The state must also have a public notice process as described belo w for Category II and III changes to the demonstration. a. Process for Category I Changes . The state must notify CMS of any change to the demonstration defined as a Category I change 30 calendar days before implementing the change. The state must also repor t these changes in the quarterly and annual reports for purposes of monitoring the demonstration. The state does not need CMS approval for changes to the demonstration that are Category I changes. If CMS determines at any time subsequent to state implemen tation of a Category I change that it is not consistent with state assurances, or is contrary to Federal statutes, regulations, or CMS policy, CMS reserves the right to request prompt state corrective action as a condition of continued operation of the dem onstration. If the state does not take appropriate action, CMS reserves the right to end the demonstration per Paragraph 10 of these STCs. b. Process for Category II Changes. The state will notify CMS of any change to the demonstration defined as a Category II change. This notification will include assurances that the change is consistent with Federal statutes, regulations, and CMS policy. No Federal funding shall be available for unapproved demonstration activities affected by a Category II change. The state must submit the notification and assurances 45 calendar days prior to the date set by the state for implementing the change. CMS will not provide f ederal matching funds for unapproved Category II changes. After receipt of the State's written notification, CMS will notify the state: i. Within 45 calendar days of receipt if the assurances supporting the change are approved; or ii. Within 45 calendar days of receipt if the assurances do not establish that the change is consistent with f ederal statutes, r egulations, and CMS policy. As part of the notification, CMS will describe the missing information, necessary corrective actions, and/or additional assurances the state must pursue to make the change consistent. iii. During days 46 and beyond, CMS will be available to work with the state. During this time period, the state can provide to CMS additional justification or assurance in order to clarify the appropriateness of the change. iv. During days 46 through 75, the state, upon taking appropriate action, must s ubmit a written statement to CMS indicating how the state has addressed CMS concerns on the assurances. Within 15 calendar days of the date of the additional submission, CMS will notify the state if the assurances are approved. v. By day 90, if the assuran ces have not been approved by CMS, the state may obtain reconsideration by pursuing the change again as a revised Category II change if the state has additional information, or as a Category III change. Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 21 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 vi. If CMS determines at any time subsequent to state i mplementation of an approved Category II change that the assurances are no longer valid, CMS shall request prompt state corrective action as a condition of continued operation of the demonstration. vii. After implementation, FFP is available for approved change s. c. Process for Category III Changes. The state must submit an amendment to the demonstration as defined in the paragraphs below. i. All amendment requests are subject to approval at the discretion of the Secretary in accordance with section 1115 of the Act. The state must not implement changes to these elements without prior approval from CMS. Amendments to the demonstration are not retroactive and FFP will not be available for changes to the demonstration that have not been approved through the amendm ent process set forth in paragraph (ii) below. The state will notify CMS of proposed demonstration changes at the monthly monitoring call, as well as in the written quarterly report, to determine if a formal amendment is necessary. ii. Requests to amend the demonstration must be submitted to CMS for approval no later than 120 days prior to the planned date of implementation of the change and may not be implemented until approved. Amendment requests must be reviewed by the Federal Review Team and must include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. An explanation of the public process used by the state consistent with the requirements of paragraph 14 t o reach a decision regarding the requested amendment; 2. A data analysis worksheet which identifies the specific \"with waiver\" impact of the proposed amendment on the current budget neutrality expenditure cap. Such analysis must include current \"with waiver \" and \"without waiver\" status on both a summary and detailed level through the current extension approval period using the most recent actual expenditures, as well as summary and detailed projections of the change in the \"with waiver\" expenditure total as a result of the proposed amendment which isolates (by Eligibility Group) the impact of the amendment; 3. An up- to-date CHIP Allotment Neutrality worksheet; 4. A detailed description of the amendment, including impact on beneficiaries, with sufficient supporting documentation including a conforming title XIX and/or title XXI state plan amendment if necessary; and 5.

Benefits are the full scope of benefits set forth in the approved state plan as of November 1, 2008, unless specified in this document. Benefits are delivered through managed care organizations or managed care delivery systems, with the exception of cer tain services paid by the state on a fee -for-service basis. Benefits that are available to RIte Care enrollees under this demonstration include all benefits listed in Attachment A and under the Medicaid State Plan . To the extent that the state complies with the provisions of section IV to make changes in the benefit package, the state has the flexibility to provide customized benefit packages to beneficiaries based on medical need. All changes in benefits (whether reductions or additions) provided through the approved alternative benefit plan SPA , for the new adult group described in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) of the Social Security Act must be submitted as an amendment to the state plan. b. Alternative Benefit Plan . Effective January 1, 2014, the New A dult Group will receive benefits provided through the state's approved alternative benefit plan (ABP) state plan amendment (SPA), which are effective, as of the effective date in the approved ABP SPA. Individuals in the New Adult Group may receive, as par t of their ABP under this demonstration, Expenditure Authority services such as Managed Care Demonstration Only Benefits specified in Attachment A of the STCs. c. Extended Family Planning Program. Family planning services and referrals to primary care services are provided to eligible recipients at or below 250 percent of the FPL who lose Medicaid eligibility at the conclusion of their 60 -day postpartum period. See Section X for more detailed requirements. d. Long -Term Care and HCBS. Long term care services are provided when medically necessary to certain individuals eligible under the Medicaid state plan. As indicated above, the New Adult Group will re ceive benefits provided through the state's approved ABP SPA. Benefit packages include long -term care and home and community -based services based on medical necessity and an individual's person- centered plan of care. The state agrees that the entity responsible for assisting the individual with development of the person- centered service plan may not be an LTSS service provider, unless that service provider is the only qualified and willing entity available to conduct the service planning. If a service provider is the only willing and qualified entity to conduct service planning, the state must establish firewalls between the service provision and planning functions to ensure conflict of interest protections. The state assures that conflict of interest prot ections will be in compliance with the characteristics set forth in 42 CFR 441.301(c)(1)(v)(vi). Benefit packages for all individuals who meet the highest, high, or preventive level of care criteria will include access to core and Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 35 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 preventive HCBS, as descr ibed in paragraph 33, subject to any waiting list as described in paragraph 34. The core and preventive service HCBS definitions are included in Attachment B of this document. The state will assure compliance with the characteristics of HCBS settings as described in 1 915(c) and 1915(i) regulations in accordance with implementation/effective dates in accordance with 42 CFR 441.301(c)(4). More detailed requirements are provided in this section. e. Limited Benefit Packages . Individuals in Budget Populations 10, 16, 18, 19, and 20 are eligible for limited benefits under the demonstration. Benefit packages may include, but are not limited to, limited pharmacy, physical health, or mental health services. 33. Long- Term Care and HCBS . Individuals eligible as aged, blind or disa bled (ABD) under the Medicaid state plan will receive benefits for institutional and home and community -based long term care services including an option for self -direction. Primary care for this population will be provided through mandatory care manageme nt programs, which include Connect Care Choice, and Rhody Health Partners. Based on a level of care determination, individuals eligible as ABD under the Medicaid state Plan can fall into the following groups: 1) highest, 2) high, and 3) preventive. a. Highe st level of care. Individuals who are determined based on medical need to require the institutional level of care will receive services through nursing homes, long term care hospitals or intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded (ICF/MR). Be neficiaries meeting this level of care will have the option to choose community -based care including core and preventive services as defined in Attachment B. b. High level of care. Individuals who are determined based on medical need to benefit from either the institutional level of care or a significant level of home and community -based services will have access to community based core and preventive services as defined in Attachment B. c. Preventive level of care. Individuals who do not presently need an ins titutional level of care will have access to services targeted at preventing admission, re- admissions or reducing lengths of stay in an institution. These beneficiaries will receive preventive services as defined in Attachment B. d. Long term care services un der this demonstration will include coverage of HCBS -like services that are equivalent to the services previously furnished under section 1915(c) HCBS waivers, including waiver numbers 0040.90.R5 (Aged and 0335.90.R1 Children- ICF/MR), 0466 (Children with Mental Illness), 0162.90.R3 (MR/DD). e. Primary and acute care services for Medicaid ABD eligib le individuals meeting the highest, high or preventive level of care may be provided through Primary Care Case Management or Rhody Health Partners or Connect Care Choice plans or other managed fee -for-service (FFS). Individuals who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid will receive primary and acute care services through Medicare FFS, a Medicare Advantage Plan , managed care delivery systems of Rhody Health Options or Connect Care Choice Community Partners or through the Program of All Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). This STC does not preclude the Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 36 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 state from entering into other contract arrangements with entities that can provide these services. 34. Waiting List for HCBS. Should a waiting list for long -term care services develop, the state m ust provide services for individuals classified in higher levels of care categories before providing services to individuals classified in lower categories. Specifically, participants receiving services must continue to receive services unless their condi tion improves and they move to a lower level of care category. Also, participants and applicants in the highest category are entitled to services and must not be put on a waiting list for institutional services. (If a community placement is not initially available, they may be put on a wait list for transition to the community.) Finally, applicants for the High group must receive services prior to applicants in the Preventive category. 35. Long- Term Care Enrollment. For those participants residing in an ins titution at the point of implementation of the demonstration, the state must apply pre -demonstration level of care criteria to those individuals unless the participant transitions to the community because he or she: (a) improves to a level where he or she would no longer meet the pre -demonstration institutional level or care, or (b) the individual chooses community care over institutional care. Once that participant is residing in the community, all future level of care redeterminations will be based on the new level of care criteria established for the purposes of this demonstration. 36. Program for All -inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). PACE is subsumed under this section 1115 demonstration program and will remain an option for qualifying demonstration eligibles, that is, those that meet the High or Highest level of care determinations. The state assures that demonstration eligibles who may be eligible for the PACE program are furnished sufficient information about the PACE program in order to make an i nformed decision about whether to elect this option for receipt of services. The state will comply with all Federal requirements governing its current PACE program, and any future expansion or new PACE program, in accordance with section 1934 of the Socia l Security Act and regulations at Part 460 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations. 37. Long- Term Care Insurance Partnership. The state must implement a Long -Term Care Insurance Partnership Program as described in the Rhode Island state plan. Under the Long -Term Care Insurance Partnership Program, an individual who is a beneficiary under a qualified long-term care insurance policy is given a resource disregard equal to the amount of insurance benefit payments made to or on behalf of the individual. The state does not seek adjustment or recovery from the individual's estate for the amount of assets or resources disregarded. Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 37 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 COST SHARING 38. Any premiums or copay requirements are specified in the Medicaid state plan. Demonstration populations may be charged premiums that do not exceed the premiums specified below. Premium Limits for Budget Populations 3, 6, and 8 Family Income Level children under 1* children 1 to 19th birthday* adults pregnant women extended family planning 150-185 percent FPL None Up to 5 percent of family income Up to 5 percent of family income None None 185-200 percent FPL None Up to 5 percent of family income Up to 5 percent of family income None None 200-250 percent FPL None Up to 5 percent of family income Up to 5 percent of family income None None *no cost sharing or premiums for children in foster care or adoption subsidy No cost -sharing for: pregnant women, children under age one (1), children in foster care or adoption subsidy, Chafee children, Alaskan Native/American Indian children and adults. o Cost-sharing for BBA working disabled adults defined in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XIII) will follow the Medicaid state plan o All unearned income over the Medically Needy Income Limit (MNIL) will be owed as a monthly premium; o Cost-sharing for Budget Population 10 is to be treated like post -eligibility treatment of income or spend- down requirements. o In order to prevent families from being burdened by two sets of premium payments, for households with incomes between 150 percent FPL and 250 percent FPL in which children are Medicaid eligible and enrolled in RIte C are, and parent/caretaker relatives are enrolled in commercial coverage, will no longer be required to pay the Medicaid pr emium, only the premium associated with the commercial coverage. Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 38 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 o DELIVERY SYSTEM 39. Assessment and Coordination Organization Process. Access to institutional and community - based supports and services will be through the Assessment and Coordination Organi zation (ACO) process. The purpose of the ACO is to streamline the intake and assessment processes and provide beneficiaries and their families with clear, concise, and accurate information about their care options. The ACO process will involve the benefi ciary and involved family members, and treating practitioners and providers to ensure comprehensive assessments and care planning. The ACO is described more fully in Attachment C. 40. Long- Term Care Services. Institutional and community -based long -term care services will be delivered through one of the following delivery systems: a. Managed Long Term Services and Supports. Beneficiaries will have access to long term care services and supports through their enrollment in Rhody Health Options or Connect Care Choi ce Community Partners b. Fee-for-service. Beneficiaries will be able to access long -term care services in the same way that services are accessed today, through a fee- for-service system. Under this system, a beneficiary can choose the Medicaid participating agency or provider who will deliver the service(s). In turn, for those services requiring authorization or that are \"out -of-plan,\" the agency/provider bills the Medicaid agency for services authorized by the ACO and/or the health plan or PCCM network. c. Self-direction . Beneficiaries (or, as they authorize, their families ) will also have the option to purchase HCBS waiver like services through a self -direction service delivery system. Under this option, beneficiaries will work with the ACO to develop a budg et amount for services needed. The beneficiary, with the support of a fiscal intermediary, will then be able to purchase services directly. This option is based on experience from Rhode Island's section 1915(c) Cash and Counseling Waiver ( RI Personal Choice), section 1915(c) Developmental Disabilities Waiver, and Personal Assistance Service and Supports program. Self -direction is fully described in the Self -direction Operations Section. 41. Primary and Acute Care Services. Primary and acute care services wi ll be delivered through the following systems: a. Managed Care Organizations: RIte Care, Rhody Health Partners, Rhody Health Options or Connect Care Choice Community Partners b. Primary Care Case Management Program : Connect Care Choice c. Pre-paid Dental Ambulatory Health Plans : RIte Smiles d. PACE : PACE Organization of Rhode Island e. Premium Assistance : Rite Share f. Fee-for-service Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 39 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 42. Contracts. On those occasions that contracts with public agencies are not competitively bid, those payments under contracts with public agencies shall not exceed the documented costs incurred in furnishing covered services to eligible individuals (or a reasonable estimate with an adjustment factor no greater than the annual change in the consumer price index). The state will contin ue to maintain a contract with a health care management consulting firm experienced in health plan management, which will be responsible for managing the operational and administrative aspects of the program under the State's direction. 43. Freedom of Choice. An enrollee's freedom of choice of providers through whom the enrollee may seek services shall be limited. This applies to all populations enrolled in the Comprehensive demonstration. No waiver of freedom of choice is authorized for family planning provi ders. 44. Selective Contracting. The state may pursue selective contracting in order to restrict the provider from (or through) whom an individual can obtain services. Emergency services and family planning services will not be covered by this provision. Providers with whom the state contracts will meet, accept, and comply with the reimbursement, quality, and utilization standards under the state plan, which standards shall otherwise be consistent with section 1923 of the Act. These standards are consist ent with access, quality, and efficient and economic provision of covered care and services. Restrictions on providers will not discriminate among classes of providers on grounds unrelated to their demonstrated effectiveness and efficiency in providing those services. If the state pursues selective contracting for nursing facilities, the state must submit, for CMS review and approval, a description of the process for selecting providers of nursing facility services and allocating nursing facility beds. Th e state must demonstrate that the process used to select providers of nursing facility services and to allocate Medicaid reimbursed nursing facility beds is consistent with access, quality, and efficient and economic provision of care and services for all participants needing nursing facility services including special regard to access to services for individuals with complex long -term care needs. 45. Process for the Review and Approval of Contracts. The following process applies to contracts between the stat e and managed care organizations, pre -paid ambulatory health plans; primary care case management providers, and contracts pursuant to the selective contracting process. All contracts listed above and modifications of existing contracts must be approved by CMS prior to the effective date of the contract or modification of an existing contract. The state will submit to CMS copies of the contracts or modifications and documentation supporting compliance with state and Federal statutes, regulations, special te rms and conditions, and waiver and expenditure authority 45 days prior to implementation VII. Health System Transformation Project The Health System Transformation Project will provide that Medicaid managed care entities must enter into arrangements with state -certified Accountable Entities (AE) as a condition of receiving a managed care contract . Such contracts, including the AE provision, will meet the requirements of 42 CFR 438. Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 40 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 46. Hospital and Nursing Facility Incentive Program - In response to the Medicaid Managed Care Rule and Regulation (42 CFR 438.6) providing authority to make incentive payments to provider, Rhode Island's Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS) developed and is implementing the Hospital and Nursi ng Home Incentive program, inclusive of data collection, performance measurement and scoring, dollar allocation for payment to providers, and funds distribution. These one -time payments for the Hospital and Nursing Facility Incentive Program, which are not to exceed $20.5 million in DY 8, will be made on or before December 31, 2017. a. EOHHS will develop and implement the program, inclusive of data collection, performance measure scoring, and dollar allocation as defined further below under Methodology. b. EOHHS will distribute paym ents to providers via the MCOs. c. Providers will be awarded incentive payments based on a set of measures that will demonstrate institutional providers' efforts towards value -based contracting arrangements, cost effectiveness, and alignment with key clinical interventions. EOHHS will distribute payments to providers via the MCOs who will distribute the payments to their contracted providers . d. The MCO s will make a payment to the applicable hospital or nursing facility based on demonstrated achievement of pre -determined performance benchmarks for established measures; if the hospital or nursing home facility does not achieve the benchmark, no payment wil l be made. The measures are listed in Attachment J. e. Each Health Plan will receive payment that corresponds to a specific provider performance report that details each specific hospital and nursing facility, the performance measure, baseline for each measu re, identified benchmark, performance score, and doll ars allocated for each measure. f. Health Plan will use this report to make the incentive payment to each applicable hospital and nursing facility on a scheduled basis as determined by EOHHS. The total amount to be paid for each provider will be equally distributed among each Health Plan for hospitals. g. Payments for each participating Hospital and Nursing Home Facility are contingent on the entity fully meeting project metrics defined in the approved Hospi tal and Nursing Home facility specific measures listed in Attachment J , 47. Accountable Entities -The following process applies to contracts between the state and managed care organizations (MCO) that require the contractor to subcontract with Accountable Entities (AE). a. There will be two \"types\" of qualified AEs depending on the capacity and focus of the participating entities: 1) Type 1 Accountable Entity: Total Population, All Services. Authority to contract for an attributed population, for all Medicaid services. A T ype 1 AE must be accountable for the total cost of care of a n attributed Medicaid population. 2) Type 2 Accountable Entity (Interim): Specialized Population, All Services. Authority to contract for a specialized population, for all Medicaid services. A Type 2 AE must Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 41 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 be responsible for the total cost of care for a specific, defined population (e.g., persons with Serious or Persistent Mental Illness or Serious Mental Illness) and all Medicaid covered services. For specialized AEs where TCOC methodologies may not be appropriate, other APM models will be implemented. b. Rhode Island will require in its managed care contracts, that managed care entities will subcontract with state -certified AEs to provide accountability for the costs of care furnished under the contract. . c. The state must develop AE Certification Standards that the state will use to certify the potential AEs within the state . The final certification standards will be submitted to CMS to review, by June 1, 2017 as Attachment K ; CMS has 60 days to review and submit suggestions to the state. T he state will notify the MCOs of the approved certified AEs. After an organization is certified as an AE and it elects to make a material modification, in its operations, the state must review and approve such modification, in the AE's operations, prior to the implementation of the AE . d. The certification standards will provide that AEs are integrated provider organizations that are accountable for the total cost of care an d healthcare quality and outcomes of an attributed population. For specialized AEs where TCOC methodologies may not be appropriate, other APM models will be implemented. The MCOs, pursuant to contract requirements with the state, will subcontract with AEs in compliance with the In -Plan Medicaid managed care benefit package. e. Prior to the MCOs contracting with AEs, EOHHS will develop Alternative Payment Methodology (APM) guidelines, which MCOs must follow in contracting with certified AEs. This methodology shall include quality benchmarks and outline the services that will be covered under the Type 1 and Type 2 Accountable Entities . The state must review and approve each MCO's APM methodologies and associated quality gates prior to implementation . The APM methodology document will be submitted to CMS for review by 10/1/ 2017 as Attachment L and may be updated annually . The MCO must utilize the APM methodology to calculate the shared savings for each AE. MCO members will be attributed to an AE pursuant to the E OHHS Attribution Guidance for the AE Program - Attachment M , which may be updated annually . f. Certified AEs who contract with MCOs in accordance with state specified APM guidance , will be eligible to participate in an AE Incentive Program. This APM guidanc e will include AE Incentive Program guidelines which MCOs must follow in contracting with certified AEs. The state must review and approve each MCOs AE Incentive Program as compliant with the standards . g. The MCO members' freedom to choose or change their providers shall not be affected by attribution to an AE. The state remains responsible for oversight of the MCOs and will augment oversight activities to ensure that the MCOs are assessing the performance of their AE subcontractors. The MCOs remain responsible to oversee the services that are delegated to the subcontracted AEs so that the MCO remains compliant with the terms of both the contract it has with the state and as stated in CFR \u00a7438.230 Subcontractual relationships and delegation.

The State must develop an Accountable Entity Roadmap for the Health System Transformation Project to be submitted to CMS for approval by June 1, 2017 CMS has 60 days to review and approve the roadmap document. The Accountable Entity Roadm ap will be a conceptualized living document that will be updated annually to ensure that best practices and lessons are learned throughout implementation that can be leveraged and incorporated into the State's overall vision of delivery system reform. This Roadmap is not a blueprint; but rather an attempt to demonstrate the State's ambition and to outline what the State and its stakeholders consider the payment refor ms required for a high quality and a financially sustainable Medicaid delivery system. Once approved by CMS, this document will be incorporated as Attachment N of these STCs, and once incorporated may be altered only with CMS approval, and only to the extent consistent with the approved waivers, expenditure authorities and STCs. (Changes to the protocol will apply prospectively, unless otherwise indicated in the protocols.) The State may not claim FFP for Health System Transformation Project until after CMS has approved the Roadmap . Payments for each participating AE are contingent on the AE fully meeting project metrics defined in the approved APM guidance document - Attachment L . In order to receive incentive funding relating to any metric, the AE must submit all required reporting, as outlined in the Accountable Entity Roadmap . In addition, the Roadmap must include the following elements : a. Specify that a menu of metrics and measures that will be used by the MCOs to assess the performance of the AEs through the activities of the AE subcontractors shall be defined in the APM guidance document . b. Include guidelines requiring AEs to develop individual AE Health System Transformation Project Plans, which shall include timelines and deadlines for the meeting of metrics associated with the projects and activities undertaken to ensure timely performance; c. Report to CMS any issues within the AEs that are impacting the AE 's ability to meet the measures/metrics , or any negative impacts to enrollee access, quality of care or beneficiary rights he state, w orking with the M COs shall monitor statewide AE performance, trends, and emerging issues within and among AE s on a monthly basis, and provide reports to CMS on a quarterly basis. d. Provide minimum standards for the process by which EOHHS seek public input in the development of the AE Certification Standards ; e. Specify a State review process and criteria to evaluate each AE's individual Health System Transformation Project P lan and develop its recommendation for approval or disapproval; f. Describe, and specify the role and function, of a standardized, AE -specific application to be submitted to the State on an annual basis for participation in the AE Incentive Program , as well as any data books or reports that AEs may be required to submit to report baseline information or substantiate progress; g. Specify that AEs must submit semi- annual reports to the MCO using a standardized Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 43 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 reporting form to document its progress in achieving quality and cost objectives, that would entitle the AE to qualify to receive Health System Transformation Project Payments ; h. Specify that each MCO must contract with Certified AEs in accordance with state defined APM guidance and state defined AE Incentive Program guidance. The APM guidance will include a Total Cost of Care (TCOC) methodology and quality benchmarks. For specialized AEs where TCOC methodologies may not be appropriate, other APM models will be specified. Describe the process for the state to review and approve each MCO's APM methodologies and associated quality gates to ensure compliance with the standards and for CMS review of the APM guidance as stated in STC 47(e) . i. Specify the role and function of the AE Incentive Program guidance to specify the methodology MCOs must use to determine the total annual amount of Health System Transformation Project incentive payments each participating AE may be eligible to receive during implementation . Such determinations described within the APM guidance document shall be associated with the specific activities and metrics selected of each AE , such that the amount of incentive payment is commensurate with the value and level of effort required; these elements are included in the AE incentive plans referenced in STC 47 (f). Each year, the state will submit an updated APM guidance document, including APM Program guidance and the AE Incentive Program Guidance. j. Specify a review process and timeline to evaluate AE progress on its Health System Transformation Project Plan metric s in which the MCO must certify that an AE has met its approved metrics as a condition for the release of associated Health System Transformation Project funds to the AE; k. Specify that AE's failure to fully meet a performance metric under its AE Health Sy stem Transformation Project Plan within the time frame specified will result in forfeiture of the associated incentive payment (i.e., no payment for partial fulfillment); l. Describe a process by which an AE that fails to meet a performance metric in a timely fashion (and thereby forfeits the associated Health System Transformation Project Payment) can reclaim the payment at a later point in time (not to exceed one year after the original performance deadline) by fully achieving the original metric in combination with timely performance on a subsequent related metric, m. Include a process that allows for potential AE Health System Transformation Project P lan modification (including possible reclamation, o r redistribution, pending State approval) and an identi fication of circumstances under which a plan modification may be considered, which shall stipulate that CMS may require that a plan be modified if it becomes evident that the previous targeting/estimation is no longer appropriate or that targets were great ly exceeded or underachieved; and n. Include a State process of developing an evaluation of Health System Transformation Project as a component of the draft evaluation design as required by STC 132. 49. Under the current managed care regulatory requirements f or state direction of MCO payments (42 CFR 438.6(c)), Rhode Island will need to ensure that the measurement period of any of the Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 44 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 performance based metrics and incentive payments within the Health Systems Transformation Project are developed and measured ov er the same term of the contract as the corresponding rate certification. With the exception of the Hospital and Nursing Home Incentive Program for DY 8, the calculation of the performance- based incentive payments will be based on the current year's performance. The state will also need to meet the prior approval requirements for directed expenditures (i.e. incentive payments in 438.6 (c)(2) for contracts with rating periods starting on or after July 1, 2017. CMS will not approve rate certifications or contracts that include directed expenditures that have not been approved prior to the start of the rating period. VIII. SELF -DIRECTION 50. Required Elements of Self -Direction. The state must meet the following requirements to operate its self -direction program for core and preventive services including through a High- Fidelity Wraparound process for children in residential treatment who are t ransitioning back to a home -based setting. 51. Voluntary Program. The program is voluntary for demonstration eligibles who are eligible for and receiving home and community based long -term care services and supports. 52. Paid Providers of Services. Except for le gally liable relatives, such as spouses and parents, any individual capable of providing the assigned tasks and freely chosen by a participant to be a paid provider of self -directed services and supports may be hired by the participant. Participants retai n the right to: 1) train their workers in the specific areas of services and supports needed; 2) have those services and supports furnished in a manner that comports with the participants' personal, cultural, and/or religious preferences; and 3) access other training provided by or through the state for their workers so that their workers can meet any additional qualifications required or desired by the participants. 53. Information Furnished to Participants. The following information must be provided to participants: principles and benefits of participant direction; participants' rights, roles and responsibilities; self -direction election other information; counseling/service advising a gency contact information; grievance and appeal process and forms; roles and responsibilities of the fiscal/employer agent and the counseling/advising agency; and participant -directed planning. Trained advisers from the service advisement agency will provide the information to participants. 54. Assessment. An assessment of an individual's needs, strengths, and preferences for services, as well as any risks that may pose a threat of harm to the individual, will be completed. The assessment includes informatio n about the individual's health condition, personal goals and preferences, functional limitations, age, school, employment, household and other factors that are relevant to the authorization and provision of services. The assessment information supports t he development of the person- centered service plan and individual budget. 55. Person -Centered Planning. The state must utilize a person -centered and directed planning process, intended to identify the strengths, capacities, preferences, needs, and desired out comes of the participant. An Individual Service and Spending Plan (ISSP) is developed with the assistance of the service advisor team and those individuals the participant chooses to include. The ISSP Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 45 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 includes the services and supports that the participa nt needs to live independently in the community. A back- up plan must be developed and incorporated into the ISSP to assure that the needed assistance will be provided in the event that the regular services and supports identified in the ISSP are temporari ly unavailable. The back -up plan may include other individual assistants or agency services. The state shall have a process that permits participants to request a change to the person- centered plan, if the participant's health circumstances necessitate a change, but in any event, the ISSP will be reviewed and updated at least annually. Entities or individuals that have responsibility for service plan development may not provide other direct demonstration services to the participant. 56. Employer Authority. Participants have the opportunity to exercise choice and control (i.e., hire, fire, supervise, manage) over individuals who furnish their long term care demonstration services authorized in the person- centered service plan. In this demonstration, the part icipant functions as the employer of record of workers who furnish direct services and supports to the participant. 57. Budget Authority. Participants also have the opportunity to exercise choice and control over a specified amount of funds in a participant -directed budget. Under the budget authority, the participant has decision- making authority and management responsibility for the participant - directed budget from which the participant authorizes the purchase of long term care demonstration services and supports that are authorized in the person- centered service plan. 58. Individual Budget. An individual budget is the amount of funds available to the participant to self-direct. It is developed using a person- centered planning process; based on actual service utilization and cost data and derived from reliable sources; developed using a consistent methodology to calculate the resources available to each participant that is open to public inspection; and reviewed according to a specified method and frequency. A change in the budget must also result in a change to the person -centered plan. 59. Information and Assistance in Support of Participant Direction. The state shall have a support system that provides participants with information, training, counseling, and as sistance, as needed or desired by each participant, to assist the participant to effectively direct and manage his or her self -directed services and budgets. Participants shall be informed about self -directed care, including feasible alternatives, before electing the self -direction option. Participants shall also have access to the support system throughout the time that they are self -directing their care. Support activities include, but are not limited to, advisement agency services and financial manage ment services. 60. Counseling/Advisement Agencies. The state shall provide each participant with a Service Advisor from a counseling/advisement agency that conducts participant screening, assessment and reassessment; participant orientation, training, prepara tion, and support of all participant functions; participant assistance in spending plan development and monitoring; and ongoing monitoring of participant satisfaction, health and safety.

FMS entities shall meet IRS requirements of being a fiscal/employer ag ent and state established certification standards to provide supports to participants. FMS shall be reimbursed as an administrative activity at the 50 percent administrative rate. 62. Services to be Self -Directed. Participants who elect the self -direction opportunity will have the option to self -direct all or some of the long- term care core and preventive services and supports under the demonstration. The services, goods, and supports that participants will self -direct are limited to the core and preventive services, listed in Attachment B. Services, goods, and supports that are not subject to employer and budget authority, i.e., participants do not have hiring authority and do not become the employer of record over these services, goods or items, will stil l be included in the calculations of participants' budgets. Participants' budget plans will reflect the plan for purchasing these needed services, goods and supports. 63. Individual Directed Goods and Services. Individual directed goods and services may be purchased from accumulated funds (\"savings\") as approved in the individual budget plan. Goods and services must relate to a need or goal identified in the person- centered service plan. Accumulated funds or savings may be carried over from month to month, and year to year, only if designated for a specific good or service. If the goods or services are not purchased at the time indicated in the budget plan, the state will recoup any unspent and un- earmarked funds at designated intervals and according to pro cedures established by the state. Goods and services that can be individually directed are defined in Attachment B Core and Preventive Services. 64. Participant Direction by Representative. The state provides for the direction of services by a representative. The representative may be a legal representative of the participant or a non -legal representative freely chosen by an adult participant. The representative shall not be paid and must p ass a screen indicating ability to perform the functions in the best interest of the participant and must pass a criminal background check. A participant who demonstrates the inability to self - direct his or her services and supports whether due to misuse of funds, consistent non- adherence to program rules or an ongoing health and safety risk, will be required to select a representative to assist him or her with the responsibilities of self -direction. If a participant refuses to select a representative, or if a participant loses a representative (if already required for participation) and cannot locate a replacement, he or she will be required to transfer to a non -self-directed traditional service delivery system. Service advisors will assist the participa nt in the transition to the traditionally delivered service system to ensure continuity of care. 65. Independent Advocacy. Each participant shall have access to an independent advocate or advocacy system in the state. This function is performed by individuals or entities that do not provide direct services, perform assessments, or have monitoring, oversight or fiscal responsibilities for the demonstration. 66. Service Plan Monitoring. The Service Advisor shall, at a minimum, make quarterly in- person visits to the participant and monthly telephone contact in the first year, then semi -annual in- person and quarterly phone contact thereafter or more when requested or indicated by concern. Additionally, the RN and Mobility Specialist assess for needs at least annually. The entire Service Advisor Team is available to the participant upon request and/or Advisor identification of a potential health/safety concern. Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 47 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 67. Expenditure Safeguards. The FMS reports monthly to the participant and the Service Advisor, and quarter ly to the state, on the budget disbursements and balances. If more than 20 percent underutilization of authorized services is discovered, the Service advisor will work with the participant in assessing the reason and crafting a solution, such as a new wor ker or a reassessment of needs. 68. Disenrollment. A participant may voluntarily disenroll from the self -directed option at any time and return to a traditional service delivery system. A participant may also be involuntarily disenrolled from the self -direct ed option for cause, such as a continuous demonstrated inability to self-direct his or her services and supports whether due to misuse of funds, consistent non- adherence to program rules or an ongoing health and safety risk. A participant who has demonstra ted an inability to self -direct his or her services and supports will be required to select a representative to assist the participant with the responsibilities of self -direction. If a participant voluntarily or involuntarily disenrolls from the self -directed service delivery option, the state must have safeguards in place to ensure continuity of services. 69. Fair Hearing. Participants may request a fair hearing when a reduction in services occurs or when a requested adjustment to the budget is denied or the amount of the budget is reduced. 70. Cash Option. At such time as the state elects, a participant may elect to receive the amount of the funds in his or her individual budget in a prospective cash disbursement. Prior to the election of the cash option, the state will notify CMS of this election according to the Process for Category II changes. Prior to implementation of the cash option, the state will secure a waiver of the income and asset requirements from the Social Security Administration. 71. Additional P opulations and Services. At such time as the state elects to add additional populations or services to the self -direction option, the state will notify CMS of this election according to the Process for Category II changes. If, however, the State's propos al to add populations or services exceeds or changes the expenditure authorities of section 1915(c), 1915(i) or 1915(j), the state will follow the Process for Category III changes. 72. Personal Needs Allowance. Effective January 1, 2014, the state will incre ase the monthly personal needs allowance by $400 for certain persons categorically eligible or eligible as medically needy for Medicaid -funded long -term services and supports. These individuals will have resided in a nursing facility for 90 consecutive da ys, excluding those days that may have been used for the sole intent and purpose of short term rehabilitation; are transitioning from a nursing facility to a community residence, and are assessed to be unable to afford to remain in the community unless the personal needs allowance is increased. This would not apply to individuals who are residing in a nursing facility and whose income is being used to maintain a current community residence. IX. EXTENDED FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAM 73. Eligibility Requirements. Fam ily planning and family planning -related services and supplies are provided to individuals that are redetermined eligible for the program on an annual basis.

Such expenditures include all expenditures that are described in paragraph 102. Payments for medical assistance for emergency services for non -qualified aliens are subject to the budget neutrality agreement. All expenditures that are subject to the budget neutrality agreement are considered demonstration expenditures and must be reported on Forms 64.9 Waiver and/or 64.9P Waiver. Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 63 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 104. Premium Collection Adjustment. The state must include demonstration premium collections as a manual adjustment (decrease) to the demonstration's actual expenditures on a quarterly basis on the budget neutrality monitoring spreadsheet. 105. Administrative Costs. Admin istrative costs will not be included in the budget neutrality agreement, but the state must separately track and report additional administrative costs that are directly attributable to the demonstration. All administrative costs must be identified on the Forms CMS -64.10 Waiver and/or 64.10P Waiver. 106. Claiming Period. All claims for expenditures subject to the budget neutrality agreement (including any cost settlements) must be made within 2 years after the calendar quarter in which the state made the expenditures. All claims for services during the demonstration period (including any cost settlements) must be made within 2 years after the conclusion or termination of the demonstration. During the latter 2- year period, the state must continue to identify separately net expenditures related to dates of service during the operation of the demonstration on the CMS -64 waiver forms in order to properly account for these expenditures in determining budget neutrality. 107. Reporting Member Months. The following descr ibes the reporting of member months for demonstration populations: a. For the purpose of monitoring the budget neutrality agreement and for other purposes, the state must provide to CMS, as part of the quarterly report required under paragraph 99, the actual number of eligible member months for all Budget Populations defined in paragraph 102. The state must submit a statement certifying the accuracy of this information accompanying the quarterly report. To permit full recognition of \"in -process\" eligibility, reported counts of member months may be subject to revisions after the end of each quarter. Member month counts may be revised retrospectively as needed. b. The term \"eligible member months\" refers to the number of months in which persons are eligible to receive services. For example, a person who is eligible for 3 months contributes three eligible member months to the total. Two individuals who are eligible for 2 months each contribute two eligib le member months to the total, for a total of four eligible member months. 108. Standard Medicaid Funding Process. The standard Medicaid funding process must be used during the demonstration. Rhode Island must estimate matchable demonstration expenditures (total computable and Federal share) subject to the budget neutrality agreement and separately report these expenditures by quarter for each Federal fiscal year on the Form CMS -37 for both the Medical Assistance Payments (MAP) and state and Local Administration Costs (ADM). CMS shall make Federal funds available based upon the State's estimate, as approved by CMS. Within 30 days after the end of each quarter, the state must submit the Form CMS -64 quarterly Medicaid expenditure report, showing Medicaid expenditures made in the quarter just ended. CMS shall reconcile expenditures reported on the Form CMS -64 with Federal funding previously made available to the state, and include the reconciling adjustment in the finalization of the grant award to the state. Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 64 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 109. Extent of Federal Financial Participation for the Demonstration. Subject to CMS approval of the source(s) of the non -Federal share of funding, CMS shall provide FFP at the applicable Federal matching rates for the demonstration as a whole as outlined below, subject to the limits described in section XVI : a. Net expenditures and prior period adjustments of the Medicaid program that are paid in accordance with the approved Medicaid state plan; and b. Net medical assistance expenditures made under section 1115 demonstration authority with dates of service during the demonstration period. 110. Extent of Federal Financial Participation for the Extended Family Planning Program. CMS shall provide Federal Financial Participation ( FFP) for CMS -approved services (including prescriptions) provided to women under the extended family planning program at the following rates and as described in Section X of these STCs. a. For procedures or services clearly provided or performed for the primary purpose of family planning (contraceptives and sterilizations) and which are provided in a family planning setting, FFP will be available at the 90 percent Federal matching rate. Procedure codes for office visits, laboratory tests, and certain other procedures must carry a diagnosis that specifically identifies them as a family planning service. b. Famil y planning- related services reimbursable at the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rate are defined as those services generally performed as part of, or as follow -up to, a family planning service for contraception. Such services are provided bec ause a \"family planning -related\" problem was identified/ diagnosed during a routine/periodic family planning visit. Services/surgery, which are generally provided in an ambulatory surgery center/facility, a special procedure room/suite, an emergency room, an urgent care center, or a hospital for family planning -related services, are not considered family planning -related services and are not covered under the demonstration. c. FFP will not be available for the costs of any services, items, or procedures that do not meet the requirements specified above, even if family planning clinics or providers provide them. For example, in the instance of testing for sexually transmitted infections as part of a family planning visit, FFP will be available at the 90 p ercent Federal matching rate. Subsequent treatment would be paid for at the applicable f ederal matching rate for the state. For testing or treatment not associated with a family planning visit, no FFP will be available. d. CMS will provide FFP at the appropriate 50 percent administrative match rate for general administration costs, such as, but not limited to, claims processing, eligibility assistance and determinations, outreach, program development, and program monitoring and reporting. 111. Sources of Non -Fede ral Share. Rhode Island certifies that the matching non- federal share of funds for the demonstration is state/local monies. Rhode Island further certifies that such funds shall not be used as the match for any other f ederal grant or contract, except as p ermitted by law. Premiums paid by enrollees and collected by the state shall not be used as a source of non -federal share for the demonstration. All sources of non- federal funding must be compliant with section 1903(w) of the Act and applicable regulations. In addition, all sources of the non- federal share of funding are subject to CMS approval. Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 65 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 a. CMS may review the sources of the non- federal share of funding for the demonstration at any time. Rhode Island agrees that all funding sources deemed unaccepta ble by CMS shall be addressed within the time frames set by CMS. b. Any amendments that impact the financial status of the program shall require Rhode Island to provide information to CMS regarding all sources of the non- Federal share of funding. Under all circumstances, health care providers must retain 100 percent of the reimbursement amounts claimed by the state as demonstration expenditures. Moreover, no pre -arranged agreements (contractual or otherwise) may exist between the health care providers and t he state government to return and/or redirect any portion of the Medicaid payments. This confirmation of Medicaid payment retention is made with the understanding that payments that are the normal operating expenses of conducting business (such as payment s related to taxes (including health care provider -related taxes), fees, and business relationships with governments that are unrelated to Medicaid and in which there is no connection to Medicaid payments) are not considered returning and/or redirecting a Medicaid payment . If the state pays the Managed Care Organizations at a rate which has not been approved by CMS, the state will agree to reconcile these payments to be in accordance with the final rates that are approved by CMS. 112. Monitoring the Demonstra tion. The state will provide CMS with information to effectively monitor the demonstration, upon request, in a reasonable time frame XV. GENERAL FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER TITLE XXI 113. Quarterly Expenditure Reports.

During the latter 2- year period, the st ate must continue to identify separately on the Form CMS -21 net expenditures related to dates of service during the operation of the section 1115 demonstration. 115. Standard CHIP Funding Process. The standard CHIP funding process will be used during the demonstration. Rhode Island must estimate matchable expenditures for CHIP Children and Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 66 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 Pregnant Women between 185 percent and 250 percent of the FPL on the quarterly Form CMS - 37.12 (Narrative) for both Medicaid Assistance Payments (MAP) and state and local Adm inistrative costs (ADM). CMS will make Federal funds available based upon the State's estimate, as approved by CMS. Within 30 days after the end of each quarter, the state must submit the Form CMS -64.21U Waiver and/or CMS -64.21UP Waiver. CMS will reconc ile expenditures reported on the Form CMS -64.21 waiver forms with Federal funding previously made available to the state, and include the reconciling adjustment in the finalization of the grant award to the state. 116. Limit on Title XXI Funding. Rhode Island will be subject to a limit on the amount of Federal title XXI funding that the state may receive on demonstration expenditures during the demonstration period. Federal title XXI funding available for demonstration expenditures is limited to the State's a vailable allotment, including any redistributed funds. Should the state expend its available allotment and redistribution, no further enhanced Federal matching funds will be available for the expenditures for demonstration Populations 6 and 7 until the ne xt allotment becomes available. Once all available title XXI funds are exhausted, the state will continue to provide coverage to Demonstration Population 6 and 7 and is authorized to claim Federal funding under title XIX funds (title XIX funds are not ava ilable for the separate program) until further title XXI Federal funds become available. The state must request a Category II change per the process outlined in STC 18 and notify CMS of its intent to exercise its authority to cover Population 7 using title XIX funds. When title XXI funds are exhausted Population 7 derives its eligibility through the costs not otherwise matchable authority under the demonstration and will be considered a title XIX expenditure. 117. Limit on Administrative Costs. Total expenditures for outreach and other reasonable costs to administer th e title XXI state plan and for the demonstration that are applied against the State's title XXI allotment may not exceed 10 percent of total expenditures. XVI. MONITORING BUDGET NEUTRALITY FOR THE DEMONSTRATION 118. Limit on Title XIX Funding. The state shall be subject to a limit on the amount of federal title XIX funding that the state may receive on selected Medicaid expenditures during the period of approval of the demonstration. For the first five years of the demonstration, the limit was s et at an aggregate amount of $12.075 billion (total computable), and beginning January 1, 2014, the limit is determined by using a per capita cost method. Budget neutrality expenditure limits are set on a yearly basis based on calculated member months with a cumulative budget neutrality expenditure limit for the length of the entire demonstration. The data supplied by the state to CMS to set the annual caps is subject to review and audit, and if found to be inaccurate, will result in a modified budget neutrality expenditure limit. CMS' assessment of the state's compliance with these annual limits will be done using the Schedule C report from the CMS -64. 119. Risk. Effective January 1, 2014, the state will be at risk for the per capita cost for demonstration populations as defined in STC 20, but not at risk for the number of participants in the demonstration population. By providing FFP without regard t o enrollment in the demonstration populations, CMS will not place the state at risk for changing economic conditions that impact enrollment levels. However, by placing the state at risk for the per capita costs of current eligibles, CMS assures that the d emonstration expenditures do not exceed the levels that would have been realized had there been no demonstration. Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 67 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 120. Calculation of the Budget Neutrality Limit. For the purpose of calculating the overall budget neutrality limit for the demonstration beginning January 1, 2014, separate annual budget limits will be calculated for each DY on a total computable basis, as described in STC 125.a. below. The annual limits will then be added together with the prior aggregate cap amount ($12.075 billion) to obtain a budget neutrality limit for the entire demonstration period. The Federal share of this limit will represent the maximum amount of FFP that the state may receive during the demonstration period for the types of demonstration expenditures described below. T he Federal share of this limit will be calculated by multiplying the total computable budget neutrality limit by Composite Federal Share 1, which is defined in STC 128 below. The demonstration expenditures subject to the budget neutrality limit are those r eported under the following Waiver Names (ABD Adults No TPL, ABD Adults TPL, RIte Care, CSHCN), plus any excess spending from the Supplemental Tests described in STCs 122 and 123. 121. Per Capita Budget Neutrality Limit and Aggregate Adjustment. For each DY, separate annual budget limits of demonstration service expenditures will be calculated. Each annual budget limit will have per capita and aggregate components. a. Per capita limits. The per capita component is determined as the sum of the products of the trended monthly per person cost times the actual number of eligible/member months, as reported to CMS by the state under the guidelines set forth in STC 107. The trend rates and per capita cost estimates for each MEG for each year of the demonstration are listed in the table below. MEG Trend Rate DY 6 (CY 2014) DY 7 (CY 2015) DY 8 (CY 2016) DY 9 (CY 2017) DY 10 (CY 2018) ABD Adults No . The difference between actual demonstration expenditures for DY 1 - 5 and the demonstration's aggregate cap for DY 1 -5 ($12.075 billion) will be added to the per capita limits to determine the cumulative budget neutrality limit for the demonstration. 122. Supplemental Budget Neutrality Test 1: Hypothetical Groups. Effective January 1, 2014, the budget neutrality test for this demonstration includes an allowance for hypothetical populations, which are optional populations that could have been added to the Medicaid program through the state plan, but instead will be covered in the demonstration only. The expected costs of hypothetical populations are reflected in the \"without -waiver\" budget neutrality expenditure limit. The state must not accrue budget neutrality \"savings\" from hypothetical populations. To accomplish these goals, a separate expenditure cap is establish ed for the hypothetical groups, to be known as Supplemental Budget Neutrality Test 1. a. The MEGs listed in the table below are for the Supplemental Budget Neutrality Test 1. MEG Trend Rate DY 6 (CY 2014) DY 7 (CY 2015) DY 8 (CY 2016) DY 9 (CY 2017) DY 10 (CY 2018) Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 68 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 2017 217-like Group $22 $23 b. The Supplemental Cap 1 is calculated by taking the PMPM cost projection for each group in the above table in each DY, times the number of eligible member months for that group and DY, and adding the products together across groups and DYs. The Federal sha re of Supplemental Cap 1 is obtained by multiplying the total computable Supplemental Cap 1 by Composite Federal Share 2. c. Supplemental Budget Neutrality Test 1 is a comparison between the Federal share of Supplemental Cap 1 and total FFP reported by the State for hypothetical groups under the MEG \"217- like group\" described in STC 102. d. If total FFP for hypothetical groups should exceed the Federal share of Supplemental Cap 1, the difference must be reported as a cost against the budget neutrality limit described in paragraph 102. 123. Monitoring of New Adult Group Spending and Opportunity to Adjust Projections . For each DY, a separate annual budget li mit for the new adult group will be calculated as the product of the trended monthly per person cost times the actual number of eligible/member months as reported to CMS by the state under the guidelines set forth in STC 107. The trend rates and per capita cost estimates for the new adult group are listed in the table below. MEG Trend Rate DY 6 - PMPM DY 7 - PMPM DY 8 - PMPM DY 9 - PMPM DY 10 - Group $855 $899 $945 a. If the state's experience of the take up rate for the new adult group and other factors that affect the costs of this population indicates that the new adult group PMPM limit described above may underestimate the actual costs of medical assistance for the new adult group, the state has the opportunity to submit an adjustment the PMPM limit, along with detailed expenditure data to justify this, for CMS review without submitting an amendment pursuant to STC 6. In order to ensure timely a djustments to the PMPM limit for a demonstration year , the revised projection must be submitted to CMS by no later than the end of the third quarter of the demonstration year for which the adjustment would take effect . b. The budget limit for the new adult group is calculated by taking the PMPM cost projection for the above group i n each DY, times the number of eligible member months for that group and DY, and adding the products together across DYs. The federal share of the budget neutrality cap is obtained by multiplying total computable budget neutrality cap by the f ederal share. c. The state will not be allowed to obtain budget neutrality \"savings\" from this population. Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 69 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 d. If total FFP reported by the state for the new adult group should exceed the federal share of FFP for the budget limit for the new adult group by more than 3 perc ent following each demonstration year, the state must submit a corrective action plan to CMS for approval. 124. Composite Federal Share Ratios. The Composite Federal Share is the ratio calculated by dividing the sum total of Federal financial participation (FFP) received by the state on actual demonstration expenditures during the approval period, as reported through the MBES/CBES and summarized o n Schedule C (with consideration of additional allowable demonstration offsets such as, but not limited to, premium collections) by total computable demonstration expenditures for the same period as reported on the same forms. There are three Composite Federal Share Ratios for this demonstration: Composite Federal Share 1, based on the expenditures reported under the MEGs listed in STC 121 (which are further defined by demonstration group in STC121); Composite Federal Share 2, based on t he expenditures reported under the \"217 -like group\" MEG, defined in STC 122; and Composite Federal Share 3, based on the expenditures reported under the \"New Adult Group\" MEG, defined in STC 123. Should the demonstration be terminated prior to the end of the extension approval period (see STC 10), the Composite Federal Share will be determined based on actual expenditures for the period in which the demonstration was active. For the purpose of interim monitoring of budget neutrality, a reasonable estimate of Composite Federal Share may be developed and used through the same process or through an alternative mutually agreed upon method. 125. Future Adjustments to the Budget Neutrality Expenditure Limit. CMS reserves the ri ght to adjust the budget neutrality expenditure limit to be consistent with enforcement of impermissible provider payments, health care related taxes, new Federal statutes, or policy interpretations implemented through letters, memoranda, or regulations wi th respect to the provision of services covered under the demonstration. 126. Enforcement of Budget Neutrality. CMS shall enforce budget neutrality over the life of the demonstration, rather than on an annual basis. However, if the state's expenditures exceed the calculated cumulative budget neutrality expenditure cap by the percentage identified below for any of the demonstration years, the state must submit a corrective action plan to CMS for approval. The state will subsequently implement the approved corr ective action plan. Demonstration Year Cumulative Target Definition Percentage DY 6 Cumulative budget neutrality limit plus: 2.0 percent DY 7 Cumulative budget neutrality limit plus: 1.5 percent DY 8 Cumulative budget neutrality limit plus: 1.0 percent DY 9 Cumulative budget neutrality limit plus: 0.5 percent DY 10 Cumulative budget neutrality limit plus: 0 percent 127. Exceeding Budget Neutrality. If the cumulative budget neutrality expenditure limit has been exceeded at the end of the demonstration period, the excess Federal funds must be returned to Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 70 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 CMS. If the demonstration is terminated prior to the end of the budget neutrality agreement, an evaluation of this provision will be based on the time elapsed through the termination date. XVII. EVALUATION OF THE DEMONSTRATION/ QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT 128. State Must Separately Evaluate Components of the Demonstration. As outlined in subparagr aphs (a) and (b), the outcomes from each evaluation component must be integrated into one programmatic summary that describes whether the state met the demonstration goal, with recommendations for future efforts regarding both components. The state must s ubmit to CMS for approval a draft evaluation design no later than 120 days after award of the demonstration. The state must submit to CMS for approval any changes to the evaluation design due to additional components in the demonstration no later than 90 days after amendment approval. CMS has 60 days to review the updated evaluation design. The evaluation must outline and address evaluation questions for both of the following components: a. Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration. At a minimum, the draft de sign must include a discussion of the goals, objectives, and evaluation questions specific to the entire demonstration. The draft design must discuss the outcome measures that will be used in evaluating the impact of the demonstration during the period of approval, particularly among the target population. The evaluation must address the adequacy and appropriateness of the benefit coverage, safety and outcome of the LTC reform and expansion groups, especially the extended Family Planning, HIV Services, El ders 65 and Over and Parents pursuing behavioral health services expansion groups. It must discuss the data sources and sampling methodology for assessing these outcomes. The draft evaluation design must include a detailed analysis plan that describes how the effects of the demonstration shall be isolated from other initiatives occurring in the state. The draft design must identify whether the state will conduct the evaluation, or select an outside contractor for the evaluation. b. Focused Evaluations. Th e separate components of the demonstration that must be evaluated include, but are not limited to, the following: i. LTC Reform, including the HCBS -like and PACE -like programs; ii. RIte Care; iii. Rite Share; iv.

The Accountable Entity Roadmap will be a conceptualized living document that will be updated annually to ensure that best prac tices and lessons are learned throughout implementation, that can be leveraged and incorporated into the State's overall vision of delivery system reform. The state must submit annually the Accountable Entity Blue Print document as outlined in STC #47. The Blueprint must contain elements of STC #47 a-n. 130. Interim Evaluation of the Marketplace Subsidy Program. The state must submit an interim evaluation of the Marketplace subsidy program to CMS by September 1, 2014 that meets the requirements of the CMS -approved evaluation design. The state must evaluate the number of individuals who participate in the program compared against the number of individuals who were enrolled in RI te Care and R Ite Share in December 31, 2013. The state must evaluate whether and how the change in the premium subsidy affected enrollment. 131. Interim Evaluation of the Accountable Entities Program . The state must submit an interim evaluation of the Accountable Entities program to CMS by December 1, 2018 that meets the requirements of the CMS -approved evaluation design. The state must evaluate the number of Certified Accountable Entities that participate in the program and the benchmarks used for the final evaluation of the effectiveness of the AEs . 132. Interim Evaluation Reports. In the event the state requests an extension of the demonstration beyond the current approval period under the authority of section 1115(a), (e), or (f) of the Act, the state must submit an interim evaluation report as part of the State's request for each subsequent r enewal. 133. Final Evaluation Design and Implementation. a. CMS must provide comments on the draft evaluation design within 60 days of receipt, and the state shall submit a final design within 60 days after receipt of CMS comments. b. The state must implement the evaluation design and submit its progress in each quarterly operational and annual report. c. The state must submit to CMS a draft of the evaluation report within 120 days after expiration of the demonstration. CMS must provide comments within 60 days after receipt of the report. The state must submit the final evaluation report within 60 days after receipt of CMS comments. 134. Cooperation with Federal Evaluators. Should CMS undertake an evaluation of the demonstration, the stat e must fully cooperate with Federal evaluators and their contractors' efforts to conduct an independent federally funded evaluation of the demonstration.

Meals on Wheels (Home Delivered Meals): The delivery of hot meals and shelf staples to the waiver recipient's residence. Meals are available to an individual who is unable to care for his/her nutritional needs because of a functional dependency/disability and who requires this assistance to live in the community. Meals provided under this service will not constitute a full daily nutritional requirement. Meals must provide a minimum of one -third of the cu rrent recommended dietary allowance. Provision of home delivered meals will result in less assistance being authorized for meal preparation for individual participants, if applicable. Personal Emergency Response (PERS): PERS is an electronic device that enables certain individuals at high risk of institutionalization to secure help in an emergency. The individual may also wear a portable \"help\" button to allow for mobility. The system is connected to the individual's phone and programmed to signal a re sponse center once a \"help\" button is activated. Trained professionals staff the response center, as specified by Center for Adult Health contract standards. This service includes coverage for installation and a monthly service fee. Providers are respons ible to insure the upkeep and maintenance of the devices/systems. LPN Services (Skilled Nursing): Licensed Practical Nurse services provided under the supervision of a Registered Nurse. Licensed Practical Nurse Services are available to participants who require interventions beyond the scope of Certified Nursing Assistant (C.N.A.) duties. LPN services are provided in accordance with the Nurse Practice Act under the supervision of a registered nurse. This service is aimed at individuals who have achieve d a measure of medical stability despite the need for chronic care nursing interventions. Individuals are assessed by a Registered Nurse (RN) in the EOHHS, Office of Community Programs. Community Transition Services : Community Transition Services are n on-recurring set -up expenses for individuals who are transitioning from an institutional or another provider -operated living arrangement to a living arrangement in a private residence where the individual is directly responsible for his or her own living e xpenses. Allowable expenses are those necessary to enable an individual to establish a basic household; these expenses do not constitute room and board and may include: security deposits that are required to obtain a lease on an apartment or home, essent ial household furnishings, and moving expense, set -up fees or deposits for utility or service access, services necessary for the individual's health and safety and activities to assess need, arrange for, and procure needed resources. Community Transition Services are furnished only to the extent that the services are reasonable and necessary as determined through the service plan development process, the services are clearly identified in the service plan, and the individual is unable to meet such expense or the services cannot be obtained from other sources. The services do not include ongoing shelter expenses, food, regular utility charges, household appliances or items intended for recreational purposes. Residential Supports : Assistance with acquisition, retention, or improvement in skills related to activities of daily living, such as personal grooming and cleanliness, bed making and household chores, eating and the preparation of food, and the social and adaptive skills necessary to enable the indivi dual to reside in his/her own home and a non -institutional setting. Payments for residential habilitation are not made for room and board, the cost of facility maintenance (where applicable), or upkeep and improvement. Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 76 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 Day Supports : Assistance with acquisition, retention, or improvement in self -help, socialization and adaptive skills. Day supports focus on enabling the individual to attain or maintain his/her maximum functioning level, and are coordinated with any other services identified in the per son's individual plan. Supported Employment : Includes activities needed to sustain paid work by individuals receiving waiver services, including supervision, transportation and training. When supported employment services are provided at a work site in which persons without disabilities are employed, payment will be made only for the adaptations, supervision, and training required by an individual receiving waiver services as a result of his/her disabilities, and will not include payment for the supervis ory activities rendered as a normal part of the business setting. Supported Living Arrangements : Personal care and services, homemaker, chore, attendant care, companion services, and medication oversight (to the extent permitted under state law) provided in a private home by a principal care provider who lives in the home. Supported Living Arrangements are furnished to adults who receive these services in conjunction with residing in the home. Separate payment will not be made for homemaker or chore ser vices furnished to an individual receiving Supported Living Arrangements, since these services are integral to and inherent in the provision of adult foster care services. Private Duty Nursing: Individual and continuous care (in contrast to part time or intermittent care) provided by licensed nurses within the scope of state law and as identified in the Individual Service Plan (ISP). These services are provided to an individual at home and require an assessment to be completed by a Registered Nurse (RN) from the Office of Community Programs . Supports for Consumer Direction (Supports Facilitation): Focuses on empowering participants to define and direct their own personal assistance needs and services; guides and supports, rather than directs and manages , the participant through the service planning and delivery process. The Facilitator counsels, facilitates, and assists in development of an ISP which includes both paid and unpaid services and supports designed to allow the participant to live in the home and participate in the community. A back- up plan is also developed to assure that the needed assistance will be provided in the event that regular services identified in the Individual Service Plan are temporarily unavailable. Participant Directed Goods and Services: Participant Directed Goods and Services are services, equipment, or supplies not otherwise provided through this waiver or through the Medicaid state plan that address an identified need, that are in the approved ISP (including improving and maintaining the individual's opportunities for full membership in the community), and that meet the following requirements: the item or service would decrease the need for other Medicaid services; AND/OR the item or service would promote inclusion in the community; AND/OR the item or service would increase the individual's ability to perform ADLs or IADLs; AND/OR the item or service would increase the person's safety in the home environment; AND alternative funding sources are not available. Individual Goods and Services are purchased from the individual's self -directed budget through the fiscal intermediary when approved as part of the ISP. Examples include a laundry service for a person unable to launder and fold clothes, or a microwave for a person unable to use a stove due to his/her disability. This will not include any good/service that would be restrictive to the individual or strictly experimental in nature. Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 77 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 Case Management: Services that assist participants in gaining access to needed waiver and other state plan services, as well as needed medical, social, educational, and other services, regardless of the funding source for the services to which access is gained. Case managers are responsible for ongoing monitoring of the provision of servic es included in the individual's plan of care. Case managers initiate and oversee the process of assessment and reassessment of the individual's level of care and review of plans of care on an annual basis and when there are significant changes in client circumstances. Senior Companion (Adult Companion Services): Non -medical care, supervision, and socialization provided to a functionally impaired adult. Companions may assist or supervise the participant with such tasks as meal preparation, laundry, and shopping. The provision of companion services does not entail hands -on nursing care. Providers may also perform light housekeeping tasks, which are incidental to the care and supervision of the participant. This service is provided in accordance with a therapeutic goal in the service plan of care. Assisted Living: Personal care and services, homemaker, chore, attendant care, companion services, medication oversight (to the extent permitted under state law), therapeutic social and recreational programmi ng, provided in a home -like environment in a licensed community care facility in conjunction with residing in the facility. This service includes 24- hour on -site response staff to meet scheduled or unpredictable needs in a way that promotes maximum dignit y and independence, and to provide supervision, safety and security. Other individuals or agencies may also furnish care directly, or under arrangement with the community care facility; but the care provided by these other entities supplements that provided by the community care facility and does not supplant it. Personalized care is furnished to an individual who resides in his/her own living units (which may include dually occupied units when both occupants consent to the arrangement) which may or may not include kitchenette and/or living rooms, and which contain bedrooms and toilet facilities. The consumer has a right to privacy. Living units may be locked at the discretion of the consumer, except when a physician or mental health professional has certified in writing that the consumer is sufficiently cognitively impaired as to be a danger to self or others if given the opportunity to lock the door. (This requirement does not apply where it conflicts with fire code.) Each living unit is separate and distinct from each other unit. The facility must have a central dining room, living room, or parlor, and common activity center(s) (which may also serve as living room or dining room). The consumer retains the right to assume risk, tempered only by the individual's ability to assume responsibility for that risk. Care must be furnished in a way which fosters the independence of each individual to facilitate aging in place. Routines of care provision and service delivery must be consumer -driven to the m aximum extent possible, and must treat each person with dignity and respect. Costs of room and board are excluded from payments for assisted living services. Personal Care Services: Personal Care Services provide direct support in the home or community to an individual in performing Activities of Daily Living (ADL) tasks that he/she is functionally unable to complete independently due to disability. Personal Care Services may be provided by : 1. A Certified Nursing Assistant which is employed under a Sta te licensed home care/home health agency and meets such standards of education and training as are established by the State for the provision of these activities. 2. A Personal Care Attendant via Employer Authority under the Self Direction option. Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 78 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 Respite: Respite can be defined as a service provided to a participant unable to care for himself/herself that is furnished on a short -term basis because of the absence or need for relief of those persons who normally provide care for the participant.

Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 80 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 ATTACHMENT C - Assessment and Coordination Organization Rhode Island Long- Term Services and Supports Assessment and Coordination Organization Summary: The Assessment and Coordination Organization is not an actual organization. It is, instead, the organization of several current disparate processes that individuals and fam ilies use when seeking long-term services and supports. Today, if an individual needs institutional or community -based long-term care services, information about those services and ways to access the services is available from many different sources. The se sources include: The Point, 211, community agencies, discharge planners, etc. Despite the well -meaning efforts of these entities, the complexity of Rhode Island's long-term care system does not always ensure the information is consistent, valid, or current. The first goal of the Assessment and Coordination Organization is to ensure that the information about Rhode Island's publicly funded long- term services and supports system provided by all sources is accurate and timely. In order to achieve this goal, the state will seek to enter into interagency agreements with each entity identified as a primary information source. Different agreements will be developed to reflect the unique relationship each primary information source has with the publicly -funded long -term services and supports system. For example, the State's Aging and Disability Resource Center, The Point , was created for the sole purpose of providing information, referrals, and general assistance for seniors, adults with disabilities, and their caregivers. The interagency agreement with The Point will reflect that role and will differ from the agreement that the state might enter with community agencies who view information and referral as secondary to their primary missions. Entities s uch as physician practices will be included in this primary information source group to the extent it is reasonable. For example, primary care practices that participate in the Connect Care Choice program will be given training on the existing programs so that they may better serve their Connect Care Choice members who have long -term services and supports needs. The interagency agreements will delineate the various ways the primary information source entity will receive information about the publicly f unded long -term care systems and other health care programs, including electronic transmissions, written information, trainings, and workshops. The agreements will indicate ways to access state agency representatives if more information is needed. The ag reements will also provide guidance on the second function of primary information source entities, appropriate referral of individuals to the next step. Appropriate referral is the second goal of the Assessment and Coordination Organization. The state will ensure those primary information sources can direct persons to the appropriate next step - whether that next step is assessment for long -term care services; counseling for enrollment into an acute care managed care program; or referral to a specific st ate agency for more information. In order to achieve this goal, the will develop a universal screening tool. This tool will be developed to capture information quickly that is necessary for the primary information source to determine the most appropria te placement and/or service referral. Depending on the results of the initial screen, an individual may be referred to the following areas: Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 81 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 Individuals determined to have a potential need for Medicaid funded long- term services and supports in a nursing facility or in the community will be referred to the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services ( EOHHS); Individuals determined to have a potential need for state -only funded long- term services and supports will be referred to the Rhode I sland Department of Elderly Affairs (RI -DEA); Individuals determined to have a potential need for services for the developmentally disabled or mentally retarded will be referred to the Rhode Island Department of Mental Health, Retardation, and Hospitals (RI -MHRH); Individuals determined to have a potential need for long -term hospital services will be referred to Eleanor Slater Hospital, a state hospital that treats patients with acute and long term medical illnesses, as well as patients with psychiatric d isorders; Individuals determined to have a potential need for behavioral health services for a child or for an adult will be referred to the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth, and Families (RI-DCYF) or the RI -MHRH, respectively; Individuals who ar e seeking information for services other than long -term care will be referred to the appropriate place. For example, information on acute care managed care options is currently provided by the EOHHS Enrollment Hotline. The assessment entities will be res ponsible for: Coordinating with the Medicaid eligibility staff; Conducting assessments; Determining levels of care; Developing service plans with the active involvement of individuals and their families; Developing funding levels associated with care plans; Conducting periodic reviews of service plans; Coordinating services with care management entities (Connect Care Choice; PACE; Rhody Health Partners); Assessments and related functions are currently conducted by the state agencies (or their contracted entities) listed above. The development of care plans is one of the most important functions conducted by these entities or their contractors. The Assessment and Coordination Organization will ensure that these care plans are developed with the active par ticipation of individuals and families. Full consumer participation will require information about the cost of services, utilization, and quality. One of the goals of the Waiver will be to provide the individual and his/her family with health reports tha t will indicate the amount that has been spent on the individual's services. This information will allow an individual to make more -informed choices about where his/her service plan dollars should be spent. These health reports will be generated through the CHOICES MMIS Module. The Assessment and Coordination Organization's third goal is to ensure improved and increased communication between these assessment entities. For example, if an individual assessed by RI -DHS for long- term community -based care is also found to have behavioral health needs, the individual's service plan will be developed in coordination with RI -MHRH. Communication between the assessment entities will occur through regular meetings and training sessions. RI-DHS, in close coordinat ion with the other EOHHS agencies, will provide the administrative functions of the Assessment and Coordination Organization. These functions include: ensuring that the primary information entities and the assessment entities coordinate functions and com municate amongst each other and with each other; establishing training sessions and workshops; regularly Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 82 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 tracking utilization; and monitoring outcomes to ensure that the Assessment and Coordination Organization's goals are met. On -going monitoring will en able the state to conduct interdisciplinary high-cost case reviews that could ultimately result in improvements to the system.

These STCs provide expenditure authority, which enables Rhode Island to operate its Section 1115 Medicaid Demonstration. Accordingly, Rhode Island established a Designated State Health Program ( DSHP) for health workforce training programs and related expenditures to support the program at the University of Rhode Island, Rhode Island College, and the Community College of Rhode Island. This expenditure authority will promote health care objectives that increase efficiency and quality of care through initiatives that transform service delivery networks. This Health Workforce Development (HWD) DSHP enables Rhode Island (\"RI\" or \"State\") to promote improved access and quality of care for Medicaid beneficiaries in the State by supporting the education and training of the health care workforce which results in employment and/or continuing education of employees in settings that provide care and services to Rhode Island Medicaid beneficiaries. Through these STCs, CMS also approved and Rhode Island established the following Designated State Health Programs (Program Groups or Program) for which FFP can be claimed: Wavemaker Fellowship Other DSHPs o Tuberculosis Clinic at Miriam Hospital o Center for Acute Infectious Disease Epidemiology o Rhode Island Child Audiology Center o Consumer Assistance Programs Office of the Child Advocate Commission on the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Through these DSHPs, additional CNOM (Costs Not Otherwise Matchable) activities have been identified for which Federal Financial Participation (FFP) may be claimed. Allowable DSHP claims for each Program are limited to the allowable DSHP costs incurred for the months of the time period defined by the STCs (STC 82). This document address es the Health Workforce Development DSHP. The other Program Groups are addressed in separate Protocols. (See Attachment Q for Wavemaker and Attachment P for all other DSHPs.) This document along with Attachments P and Q are attachments to those STCs and contain the protocol for determination of the expenditures eligible for FFP, the claiming and reporting methods and identify the records required to be maintained to support the STCs. As stated in STC 85, \"the annual limit the state may claim FFP for wo rkforce training programs is limited to total costs, in accordance with the OMB Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards\". The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) circular effective December 26, 201 3, \"Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 113 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards\", defined at 2 CFR 200.402, as amended from time to time (also called \"Super -circular\") provides guidance for determining the allowable costs under this protocol. All claimable DSHP expenditures will be paid from the IHEs general funds up to the amount of the State's annual appropriation to each IHE which meet CMS's conditions as eligible state share in claiming FFP. These expenditures will not include expenditures used to meet any federal maintenance of effort requirements nor to provide match for any other federal purpose or grant. Rhode Island Medicaid will enter into an Interagency Service Agreements (ISA) with each of the three State colleges/universities. Each Agreement will specify what can count as a DSHP expenditure, documentation requirements of the school, and an assurance that the school gives RI Medicaid authority to submit the claim based on their doc umented, eligible DSHP expenditures. In accordance with the ISA, each state college/university will provide verification that the DSHP eligible expenses are accurate and complete and are based on the instructions provided to each school in this claiming p rotocol. The IHE will submit expenditures on a quarterly basis (Exhibit B) and provide an \"Expenditure Verification\" (EV) form (Exhibit A) signed by the appropriate financial officer at the school, e.g., the Chief Financial Officer or Controller. This EV will be submitted to RI EOHHS for review and validation. These expenditure reports will be a part of the quarterly report to CMS. After review of the EV document and expenditures, EOHHS will submit the claim to CMS for the verified eligible expenditures. In order to provide CMS with timely assurance and support for the DSHP payments, the State will document through a quarterly repor t to CMS the expenditure detail supporting the request for DSHP payments. EOHHS will report expenditures under the Other/Misc. line for 64 and 37 report purposes, unless otherwise instructed by CMS. Federal funds will be claimed within two years followin g the calendar quarter in which the state makes expenditures for the HWD DSHP. IHE Expenditures Per STC # 85, \"the state may claim FFP for health workforce training programs and related supports at the University of Rhode Island, Rhode Island College and Community College of Rhode Island.\" Each IHE will determine the \"Allowable Costs\" for each \"Allowable (Educational) Program\" in each accounting quarter, within the terms defined under the STCs, commencing with date of approval of the STCs, October 20, 2016. Expenditures for DSHP allowable Health Workforce Development (\"HWD\") are defined in the STCs as those incurred by Rhode Island's three public Institutions of Higher Education including the University of Rhode Island, Rhode Island College and the Community College of Rhode Island to educate and train health professionals in fields to benefit Medicaid beneficiaries. The focus of the discussion following will be on the identification of allowable expenditures incurred by IHEs in training health care p rofessionals. Expenditures Claimable for FFP Expenditures incurred for health workforce training and development activities must be allowable, reasonable and allocable and support the goals of the Rhode Island HSTP initiative. Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 114 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 These expenditures, termed \"Allowable Costs\") are made on behalf of qualified individuals who graduate from an \"Allowable Program\" who work for \"qualified employers\", where, The healthcare workforce is comprised of \"qualified individuals (students) \" and defined as individuals who: Graduate from an allowable program offered by one of the state's public higher education institutions; Obtain employment in Rhode Island with one or more \"qualifying employers\" that provide services to Medicaid enrollees (such as hospitals, nursing homes , health centers, and other participating providers); or Individuals who are currently employed by a \"qualifying employer\" and who complete a continuing education program provided by the state schools designed to increase the ability of the individual to i mprove the quality, outcomes, and/or cost effectiveness of care and services to Medicaid enrollees; \"Allowable Programs\" are those Programs (degree, certificate, license academic offerings) that train students for a health care profession, are defined for each IHE; programs will vary by IHE depending upon the IHE's focus, course, degree and educational offerings and will be collectively determined through discussion and analysis between each IHE and EOHHS. \"Allowable Programs\" may include but are not limited to the following*: Department of Nursing Department of Pharmacy Health Care Administration Allied Health Programs Dental Health Programs Rehabilitative Health Programs *The IHEs quarterly expenditure reports will be a part of the quarterly report to CMS and will include the specific programs with the respective CIP Codes listed on each school's report. \"Qualified employers\" are defined as those employers that are Rhode Island Medicaid providers; \"Allowable Costs\" will include: The total costs of qualifying health training program at the three state schools, determined in accordance with the OMB Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards\" (aka \"Super Circular\"). Adjusted by the \"percentage of q ualifying students\" in each program in the previous year. \"Total Cost\", defined in the Super -circular, \"is the sum of the allowable direct and allocable indirect costs less any applicable credits...such as purchase discounts, rebates or allowances.\" \"Direct costs\" are those costs specifically identified with delivery of a particular objective, in this case, DSHP direct costs are those for delivery of healthcare educational training. DSHP direct costs would include salary and benefits for those who directly deliver the health training programs (e.g., the faculty) and for direct costs necessary to the educational process such as, educational materials, educational subscriptions, guest lecture fees, teaching lab supplies. \"Indirect costs\" include those costs that are necessary to the educational process and the granting of degrees and certificates but apply to the entire institution that provides the Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 115 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 education and training. For purposes of computing \"total costs\", each IHE will use the rates approved in their current Indirect Rate Agreement approved by the U. S. Department of Health And Human Services Division of Cost Allocation Services. The rates in these agreements were approved in accordance with the authority of the Office of Management and Budget Circul ar A-21 (which has been super -ceded by the Super -circular\"). The current indirect rate agreements can be found on each IHEs website. Identification of Allowable Programs Working in collaboration with the IHE, EOHHS will identify those educational program s that train individuals for a career in the health care professions. Each program will be associated with the CIP code for that instructional program as defined by the National Center for Education Statistics Classification of Instructional Programs ( CIP) which provides a taxonomic scheme that supports the accurate tracking, assessment, and reporting of fields of study and program completions activity. From this taxonomic listing of CIP codes, EOHHS together with the IHEs will identify courses of study t hat train individuals for a career in the health care professions. Identification of Allowable Costs Working in collaboration with EOHHS, the IHE will identify the expenditures associated with those programs of study that meet the requirements for credentials for each of the allowable health care degrees or certificates. The allowable costs will be guided by the standards defined in the OMB's then current Super -Circular with the IHE's federally -negotiated and approved indirect rate(s) including on- campus and off -campus rates, as appropriate, utilized to develop Total Costs as defined in #85 of the above referenced STCs. Determination of Allowable Costs Each IHE uses an integrated accounting system which classifies expenditures based upon academic departments. Though not all utilize the same system, they accumulate, process, and employ coding structures in similar formats for reporting and audit purposes. The charts of accounts structures have these primary coding structure elements: fund, organiz ation, account, and program. Transactions in the systems require these coding structures to store, process, and report out expenditures for all programs, including the programs to be claimed under this DSHP. Through their respective chart of accounts, each IHE records and classifies expenditures for each academic department in the respective accounting systems by functional area. The respective costs of each academic department aggregate to the total costs of the IHEs as presented in their respective Financial Statements. Additionally, to provide consistency across the IHEs in the determination of Allowable Costs, principles from the National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO) Accounting Principles Council will be utilized in guiding functional reporting of expenses and types of natural expense categories of expense reporting. NACUBO is a membership organization representing more than 2,100 colleges and universities across the country with the mission to advance business prac tices for higher education institutions. Among the functional reporting categories are: Instructional, Research, Public Service, Academic Support, Student Services Administration, Institutional Support, Operations and Maintenance of Plant, Scholarships a nd Fellowships, and Auxiliary Operations. Expenditures to be claimed under this Protocol can be classified as \"Instructional\" using the NACUBO principles and are included in the respective financial statements of each IHE. The IHE's Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 116 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 financial statement s are audited annually and, since each IHE is a component unit of the State of Rhode Island, are included in the State's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR). The IHE will complete the section titled \"To be Completed by IHE\" on \"Allowable Cost Rep orting\" template at Exhibit B of this Attachment for each calendar quarter and will include allowable costs incurred on or after the date of approval of the STCs, October 20, 2016, in accordance with the requirements of this Attachment S. Reporting of All owable Costs Using the IHE's accounting system, the IHE will identify the allowable costs, as described above by Allowable Program, incurred in a calendar quarter commencing with the date of CMS' approval of the STCs (October 20, 2016) and will complete and submit the template in Exhibit B to EOHHS no later than forty (40) days after the end of each calendar quarter. EOHHS reserves the right to submit DSHP qualifying and allowable expenditures received from an IHE for FFP claiming as long as the expenditur es were incurred no more than 2 years prior to the date of FFP claim, in accordance with the federal regulation at 45 CFR Part 95, Subpart A. Verification of Allowable Costs Along with the completed Allowable Cost template ( Exhibit B ), the IHE will provide an Expenditure Verification form (EV) ( Exhibit A) to this Claiming Protocol attesting that the reported expenditures are accurate, are those only for Allowable Programs, include only Allowable Costs and are not used as match or MOE (Maintenance of Effort ) for any federal program or grant. Substantiation of Allowable Costs For all expenses claimed under this project, the expenses must be auditable and comply with all IHE approval and processing procedures and be properly authorized, documented, and recor ded in the respective purchasing, payroll and accounting systems. The IHE will provide reports, procedure narratives and such other documentation as requested by EOHHS as needed for audit or such other compliance or documentation purposes as arise from ti me to time. All labor expenditures must be auditable and be supported by records produced by the IHE's human resource and payroll systems, e.g., payroll register. All salary and benefit expenditures included in Exhibit B will be subject to audit and the IHE will retain sufficient documentation for each expenditure to withstand audit. Workforce Calculation Methodology The amount of FFP to be claimed under this protocol is determined by: A. Each IHE determining the \"Allowable Costs\" for each \"Allowable (Educational) Program\" in each accounting quarter; and, B. Adjusted by the \"percentage of qualifying students\" in each program in the previous year as depicted in the following graphic: Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 117 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 As in the formula above in \"Expenditures Claimable for FFP\", the percent (%) to be applied to Allowable Costs by IHE will be calculated using the percent calculation, shown here and above, and described below. A. The percent (%) (\"Workforce Participation %) will be determined by matching the: 1. The Numerator = Graduates of an IHE employed by a Rhode Island Medicaid provider as determined from wage records by person by type of Rhode Island employer by health-related NAICS Code ( North A merican I ndustry Classification S ystem). The North American Industr y Classification System or NAICS (pronounced \"nakes\") is a numbering system (called \" NAICS code\") that employs a five or six -digit code at the most detailed industry level. EOHHS will review the NAICS classifications and identify those codes that are relevant to health care providers. Against, 2. The Denominator = Graduates1 from each IHE trained in a health profession, as determined by CIP Code ( Classification of I nstructional P rograms). 1Where \"graduate\" is an employed individual in Rhode Island who graduated from an \"allowable health care training program\", as defined by allowable CIP codes. B. The Workforce Participation % will be calculated utilizing the most recently available graduation and employment data. The lag time for availability of relevant graduation and employment data is approximately one year after the end of the academic year; for example, 2015 data is available in the Summer of 2016; therefore, as an approximation for the 2017 workforce %, the most recently available actual data (2015 for academic year 2017) will be utilized for application to the 2016- 2017 academic year costs. Thereafter, the participation % to be applied to the allowable costs will be based on the most recently available actual academic year data. Workforce Data Source Both the graduate level data and the employer data will be obtained by EOHHS from agencies which specialize in tracking of labor and employment statistics and include the Rhode Island Office of the Postsecondary Commissioner, the Rhode Island Departme nt of Labor and Training and the Providence Plan (http://provplan.org/). Rhode Island Comprehensive Demonstration Page 118 of 124 Demonstration Approval Period: December 23, 2013 through December 31, 2018 Amended April 13, 2017 Claiming Upon receipt of Exhibit A with the attachment Exhibit B from each IHE, EOHHS will review the submission and, as necessary, within 10 business days of receipt raise questions with the IHE for resolution within 10 business days. Once the IHE affirms the submitted costs, EOHHS will apply the Workforce percentage defined in \"Workforce Calculation Methodology\" above and calculate \"Total Claimable Expenditures\". EOHHS will then fo llow their existing procedures for claiming the FFP. Reporting EOHHS will include claimed DSHP expenditures on the CMS -64 schedule for each quarter. The IHEs quarterly expenditure reports will be a part of the quarterly report to CMS and will include the specific programs with the respective CIP Codes listed on each school's report. Changes to Previously Claimed Amounts EOHHS shall inform the IHE of any communication and provide the IHE with a copy of any letter or other communication from state or federal officials or staff relating to questions, audits, review, request for information, deferral, recoupment or disallowance of FFP for expenditures certified by the IHE. The IHE shall inform EOHHS of any communication and provide EOHHS with a copy of any letter or other communication from state or federal officials o r staff relating to questions, audits, review, request for information, deferral, recoupment or disallowance of FFP for expenditures certified by the IHE pursuant to this Agreement. The State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations Medicaid Agency (EOHHS) requires certain information to enable EOHHS to recognize costs incurred for services rendered for Designated State Health Program (DSHP) as allowable expenditures. The Expenditure Verification (EV) form provides EOHHS with verification of expenditures by Rhode Island's public Institutions of Higher Education which will allow EOHHS to draw federal matching funds. This mandatory form will be retained as part of the fiscal documentation for EOHHS. The completed and signed EV form must be submitted to the attention of the DSHP Project Director by FAX to (401) 462- 4652; by email to paul.loberti@ohhs.ri.gov or mailed to: Paul G.
