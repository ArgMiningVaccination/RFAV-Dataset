Nutraceuticals are biologically active phytochemicals that possess health benefits, encompassing prevention and treatment of disease. In simple terms, this means that the chemicals in your fruits and vegetables can influence your cells in a powerful way. The natural bioactive agents from plants are gaining wide attention for their anticancer activities. Curcumin for example, exerts anticancer effects through several mechanisms, which affects regulation of cell growth and apoptosis (cell death). For instance, curcumin can inhibit angiogenesis (new blood vessel growth), as well as inhibit proliferation and metastasis (cancer spread), decrease chronic inflammation and combat mutated cancer cells. I hear you; it's sounds pretty amazing! These may be delivered to you as a dietary supplement and/or as a functional food. Why I Recommend High-Quality Practitioner only Nutraceuticals Purchasing dietary supplements that you can trust can be a challenge. Many manufacturers of nutraceuticals focus far too much on marketing and fancy labels, rather than placing the majority of their resources where it matters most, namely the creation of a quality product. The simple truth is that not all supplements are created equal. "}
