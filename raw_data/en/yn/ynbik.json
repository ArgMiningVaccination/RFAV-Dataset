My life has changed for the better ever since I worked with her. I had recently been hospitalized for heart attack symptoms (I'm only 27 and a holistic health freak so that's not normal) but the doctors found nothing wrong with me at all. I knew something was wrong but had no idea. I continued to get doctor check ups and tests because I felt so sick, but still they found nothing. I continued to push through my sickly feeling and then months later I had the biggest loss of my life. I was struggling in every aspect and on top of that old addictions came back to me. I felt like I had no control. Tons of negative energy had been attacking me so when I met Stephanie and learned about her work I was eager to try a session. Although I was struggling financially I knew it was something I needed to invest in. I already started feeling better when I booked a session. During the session she found my heart had been very closed off and helped me open my heart and give my problems to God. The heart pain I went to the hospital for was a soul issue not a health issue. As she helped me open my heart tons of pressure was released and I felt so amazing! Things from the past came up that I had no idea I was still holding on to. I was able to forgive and let go not only during the session but everyday from there on out. This healing helped me with my addictions, financial struggles, pain and much more! I live in such a higher state of consciousness now and positive things come easily to me after my healing. I have learned so much and can't wait to keep growing spiritually! I will continue to receive these sessions from her whether I'm going through a bad time or just want to get closer to God and advance in all aspects. It has been the best healing experience of my life and I recommend everyone to reach out! Thank you so much Stephanie for helping me change my life!! - 9/6/2018 Stephanie is a gifted and intuitive healer. She brings a lot of unconditional love to the healing, and she is expert at guiding you to release negative emotions and let go of what doesn't serve you. Stephanie creates a safe space to let go, and everything she does is through the highest frequency with angels and God. Stephanie's positivity, warmth and genuine caring will leave you feeling lighter and free of any emotional blocks that may be holding you back. I highly recommend you receive a spiritual energy healing! - 8/30/2018First to Review Thank you for blessing my life and home.

I would highly recommend Highest healing energy to all. I have had 3 healings and every time it has been a beautiful experience. From group healing to individual it's been amazing. The Spirtual healings have helped me with so much by cutting off burdens, my past and more importantly myself. Thank you so much Stephanie for everything. I'm truly blessed and oh so grateful for everything. - 11/13/2018 The experience was amazing and I felt free from whatever er was in my house. I have a great energy and flow through out. I would definately use and recommend her again. - 9/9/2018 I want to thank Stephanie for an incredible healing session! We had so many break throughs. I came to her needing clarity and guidance to help me with finding my self confidence again . I'm sure many are skeptics, but everything is done through prayer and our GOD Almighty. She (Stephanie) was my ANGEL helping me get past a difficult time in my life. I encourage all feeling down, or going through anything personal you want to get through? Call her!! She takes her time with you and makes sure of whatever you doubt in life or want to see past, she's with you, till your free of all negative. Thank you Stephanie for being my Angel. Business owner information Stephanie M. 9/9/2018 Hi Darlene, this is so sweet! thank you for reaching out and requesting a healing session with me... it was so beautiful to witness your personal experience with God and everything that was allowed to be lifted from you that day! I am excited for all that is coming your way please keep me posted and I look forward to helping you evolve spiritually and keep all those negative energies away :) - 9/6/2018 I have been dealing with health issues for quite some time. I figured why not try healing it couldn't hurt to try. Within the first week i noticed changes! A lot of the reason why I'm dealing with health issues it's because of my diet. I never mentioned this, i only expressed that i was going through health issues. Well, i started experiencing nausea when ever i drank Coca Cola. And i am addicted to soda particularly that one. I was shocked that i, was being grossed out by the soda also at the fact that it didn't taste good to me anymore. I am now a believer. For anyone trying a healing for the first time i would say go in with an open mind and heart! She is truly amazing. Business owner information Stephanie M. 9/9/2018 Thank you for sharing this with us! Your healing experience is a true testament of how our bodies respond to these healings, the fact that you can't even drink sodas because your body is rejecting it, goes to show you that there are no limitations to what these beautiful Spiritual Shamanic Healings can do for anyone needing help health wise. Blessings always - 9/5/2018 I had an energy healing session with Stephanie a couple of months ago, wasn't sure what to expect but I wanted to give it a try because I've been experiencing negativity around me and nothing was going my way. When I met her she made me feel comfortable and listened to my concerns, she also explained the process. The session lasted a little over an hour I could feel everything that she was cleansing off of me idk it's hard to explain but it just made me feel lighter and like my natural self again. I've been doing good now and I truly feel so empowered to move forward with my plans I had been procrastinated on. I will continue to come see her for more healing sessions Business owner information Stephanie M. 9/9/2018 Hi Sheetal...so glad you received a healing session with me and I'm looking forward to helping you in the near future again :) Other Reiki Nearby [read more](/adredir?ad_business_id=equJkPm0TCpBU9t1MJ6aVA&campaign_id=oYVWHz7xgM6M-7AOIL5_PA&click_origin=read_more&placement=below_biz_review&placement_slot=1&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yelp.com%2Fbiz%2Fcalifornia-psychic-mediums-downey%23atb_alias%3AAboutThisBizSpecialties&request_id=a7c5f93350e24638&signature=a8953622bd9f967d8a59463724ddfe01b3c279631abff1a8f1e881e9e5178186&slot=0) in Reiki, Psychic Mediums, Astrologers [read more](/adredir?ad_business_id=VsLun8223BroSq15kWWIVA&campaign_id=gnV7WmmoyQYkq88CCp2iCQ&click_origin=read_more&placement=below_biz_review&placement_slot=1&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yelp.com%2Fbiz%2Fthe-healing-shoppe-crystal-boutique-upland%3Fhrid%3DeBXELoND5ge_BkC0E-IB6w&request_id=a7c5f93350e24638&signature=4f68fb60269305583596e4e489d10625837e27d902bf8dac0ed0a63e57312a9e&slot=1) in Hypnosis/hypnotherapy, Gemstones & Minerals, Reiki "}
