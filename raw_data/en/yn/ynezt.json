In fact, using scent in different ways can have a profound effect on your mind and body, thanks to a complex system of nerves in your brain called the limbic system. Our limbic system affects our emotions, memory, learning, appetite, and hormones. Breathing or smelling essential oils can help stimulate different bodily responses, such as breathing patterns, blood pressure, and heart rate. We know it's not always easy to carry bottles of essential oils around with you (or affordable), which is why we've infused our products to carry these scents with you on your skin, and experience the benefits while in your most intimate moments of cleansing and care. As a natural products producer, our customers care about what's in our products and the quality of ingredients coming into contact with their skin. At the same time, we wanted to continue to infuse our formulas with powerful sea kelp extract. Our kelp extract is raw, unprocessed and packed full of nutrients as it's infused into our products. Being untreated to maintain nutritional content, it carries a distinctive scent of dulse, salt water, umami. To mask the natural scent from the kelp, we chose scents that were subtle, natural and fit into categories of helping our bodies deal with daily stressors. The essential oils we use in our products are powerful and need to be diluted before use. This is why they are combined with carrier oils such as avocado oil, castor oil, coconut oil, and olive oil. This dilution increases the surface area where the essential oil can be absorbed and lowers the risk of experiencing any skin sensitivity issues. Soothing; Eucalyptus, Mint, Chamomile, Spearmint These scents are herbal, grounding, fresh and cooling. They smell great on skin, and activate when in hot water under a shower or bath. Energizing: Orange / Citrus, Seabuckthorn, Lemon Great in the morning, these scents are bright, punchy, and fresh. They energize the skin and invigorate the mind. They also layer quite well with more grounded, musky scents and provide a nice, subtle, long lasting skin scent. Calming: Lavender, Mint, Chamomile When anxiety hits, the mind needs to simplify and calm. Lavender and Mint are both known to relax the mind and provide peace. They have a very subtle on-skin scent, but during a bath or shower they come alive. 1. Think of how aroma can be incorporated into your life. For many of us, taking time for sniffing essentials can be tough, but we all cleanse ourselves! Skincare and cleansing can be a great opportunity to incorporate this form of therapy into your day to day. 2. You want to look for products that posses these natural scents, natural formulas, and avoid heavy synthetics. Many artificial scents can have the opposite effect on your body and mind, causing irritation and headaches. 3. Be conscious of your body and it's stressors. Use aroma as a powerful additive to your de-stressing practices like exercise, getting outside, yoga, meditation, etc. Trust in the science. Even if it feels strange.
