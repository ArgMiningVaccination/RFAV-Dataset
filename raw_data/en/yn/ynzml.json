In the city of Tegucigalpa, Honduras, he trained a team of Honduran surveyors to collect data on cultural and personal beliefs associated with health-seeking behaviors and spiritual or religious practices. While few complementary and alternative medicine studies include prayer as a potential treatment, Catalino's research accounted for prayer to God and Saints, in combination with herbal medicines. Among his findings, Catalino found an association between daily devotional time and the use of preventive health services. He hypothesizes that people who pray or engage in a daily spiritual practice are accustomed to a routine, and would be more likely to engage in routines associated with their health. These routines could include visiting a doctor regularly or taking medications on a daily basis. From his field experience and MSc-GH coursework, Catalino gained a new appreciation for the complexities associated with conducting global health research, as well as the value of pre-planning and flexibility while in the field. Catalino is continuing to work with project mentors Drs. Reyna Dur\u00f3n and Kenton Holden to bring his research results back to the Honduran community for consideration by local health personnel. Next fall, Catalino plans to attend medical school at Georgetown University. He hopes to return to Honduras or another international setting with the hopes of combining his interests in global health and medicine. "}
