Relax, receive & rejuvenate your mind, body, & spirit in this profound community healing session. The ancient technology of sound combined with the medicine of acupuncture will deepen and awaken the wisdom of your body's innate intelligence, allowing you to fully surrender into your natural healing process. Our time together begins with an opening circle and needles* and settles into a soothing sound bath. *Needles are optional and you'll have the choice to be treated with ear seeds or tuning forks instead if you wish. You will be given a general treatment for re-balancing the nervous system, metabolism, and inducing a deep state of relaxation. Astaria will share a vibrational sound bath to enhance the effect of the acupuncture and to facilitate a deeper state of consciousness in support of self healing and harmonization. You will be serenaded with beautyfull instruments and Astaria's multi-dimensional vocalizations, along with needles, acupressure, tuning fork applications and aromatherapy (according to your preference).

I felt myself return home.BRIAN Heidi Earthstar has been studying and practicing various Asian healing modalities since 2005 and became a licensed acupuncturist in 2017. She considers her style of acupuncture to be gentle and intuitive, using a few different lineages to help address both chronic issues and helping one's body return to a natural state of balance and harmony. As appropriate during a private session, she can also offer cupping, guasha (scraping), moxa and Shiatsu to help move and boost qi, and clear blockages as needed. She was previously working in Portland, OR, before moving to Costa Rica last year. Astaria offers sound as vibrational medicine for empowering self-healing, awakening truth, and connecting with the heart. Astaria is a harmonic energy artist, certified Sound Healing Practitioner, Reiki Master, Shamanic Medicine Practitioner, and trained Counsellor. She intuitively facilitates sound healing sessions for individuals, groups, and special events, utilizing a variety of instruments such as flutes, medicine drum, crystal alchemy bowls, tuning forks, chimes, and channeled multidimensional frequencies through her voice. Astaria was first introduced to Chinese Medicine in 2009 when she took on the role of managing an Acupuncture healing center. Receiving regular sessions greatly assisted on her journey at the time and helped set her on the path of discovering her own healing medicine. Astaria created the Acu-Sonic experience in 2015 as a way to collaborate with other healers and combine different modalities to offer something new. She has since worked alongside many acupuncturists, introducing this healing blend within various communities where she's travelled and lived.
