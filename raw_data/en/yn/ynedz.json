We have found one of the key causes of poor healing in patients are due to toxins that have built up in the tissues. These toxins impair the body's own inherent ability to repair and heal itself. When toxins are carefully removed, many chronic and seemly impossible to treat conditions seem to improve or respond quickly to treatment. At the center we screen patients for some of the major toxins and offer many different ways to detoxify the body: - Oral chelation - IV chelation - herbal enhancement of the bodies detoxification system - homeopathic stimulation of the bodies detoxification system - adjunctive trace mineral support - Intravenous chelation - Ionic foot-bath - Ozonated Sauna therapy - laser photophoresis - micro-current therapy - Massage therapy - Acupuncture Unfortunately, we live in an extremely toxic environment. We are exposed to toxins in the air, water, food, and from our own internal environment. The amount that we are exposed to is so mind boggling, the average person throws up their hands and decides to ignore the whole issue. Most us are equipped with sophisticated detoxification systems in our bodies that allow us to tolerate the toxins and eliminate most of them so that we can function at some reasonable level. When we are young, we have less accumulated toxins and our detox system can handle the toxins. As we age, our detox system begins to fail (partly because the toxins themselves also damage our detox pathways). Unfortunately, even the young are damaged by toxins especially those who suffer from autism, autistic spectrum disorders, ADD, depression or any variety of developmental/ neurological can be either caused or aggravated by toxins. Toxins can injure every aspect of our body: our immune system, our tissue repair system, our hormonal system, our digestive system, and our nervous system. Eventually, some time in our life, our detox system weakens and we begin to suffer from major illnesses. Of the many environmental toxins that we are exposed to we have found a few key toxins to be the underlying culprit behind many illnesses. By far, mercury is one of the worst and most pervasive toxin in humans and requires special mention and attention. The next is lead. Lead is abundant in this world and the sources are numerous. "}
