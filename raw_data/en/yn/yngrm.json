Traditional Chinese Medicine has been practiced on the Asian continent for the better part of five millennia, and over the last several decades has been getting popularity in the West. This traditional system of healing brings a unique and extremely effective methodology to treating imbalances within the body. Understanding TCM theory can give practitioners a deeper and more profound insight into new ways to treat clients. Likewise, aromatic medicine has been used since the dawn of time to treat various conditions, and connect us with our spiritual and energetic beings. The use of aromatic oils provides a direct link between our environment and our energetic bodies. Physiologically, aromatherapy offers a wide array of treatments that are often unmatched in modern medical world. By combining these two highly effective modalities the practitioner and layperson alike can hope to be able to utilize essential oils in new and exciting ways. The purpose of this class is to teach students how to integrate TCM theory and the use of essential oils into an existing aromatherapy practice, or even just for family and home use. Students can expect to learn the basics of TCM theory, how essential oils fit within this ancient healing system, and the qualities and energetics of various essential oils according to Traditional Chinese Medicine.
