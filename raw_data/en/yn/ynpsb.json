[Dr. Artemis partners with Xymogen](https://drartemis.com/nutritional-supplements/xymogen-epedigree-system/) for Secure online ordering with 100% product traceability from manufacturer to you. 1. QUALITY OF INGREDIENTS consistent with product label You don't know what you are getting if you get them from other places (pharmacy, vitamin stores, etc.). *There are not any strict standards on quality of ingredients for nutritional supplements and herbs and that leads to lack clinical effectiveness. The FDA is trying to improve standards with their updated Dietary Supplements Health and Education Act (DSHEA) ( [www.cfsan.fda.gov](http://www.cfsan.fda.gov)) through improving good manufacturing practices (GMP), however, there will never be a substitute for expert advice. If you are getting your nutritional supplements from a Naturopath's office your doctor is expertly trained in choosing quality supplements that can be effective if taken properly. *Most quality supplement companies sell only to Naturopathic physician's, therefore, you have access to the highest quality products from your Naturopath's office. You will save time and money by consulting an expert that can judge the quality of a supplement for you. 2. EFFICACY So, you read in a magazine that Echinacea is good for colds- Well, did you know there are many species of Echinacea and that not all of them are as potent as an immune system booster? This is information your Naturopathic Physician has had at least four year's training in as part of their medical school education. 3. SAFETY How do you know the Echinacea is safe for you? Herbs and supplements, while safer than pharmaceutical drugs in general, do have potential side-effects and interactions with other medication if not taken properly. Your Naturopathic physician is an expert in what herbs and supplements interact with medication and is available to you if you should experience any concerns. You can actually be doing more harm than good by taking a product over the counter. For example, fish oils as we all know are good for your heart may help lower cholesterol levels, and are anti-inflammatory. This is NOT true if you are taking a poor quality fish oil that has gone rancid and has not been tested for harmful heavy metals- rancid fish oils may actually increase your cholesterol by causing oxidant rather than preventing oxidation. Be safe rather than sorry- it is worth it financially and health wise in the end. 4. GENETICS and BIOCHEMICAL INDIVIDUALITY Our fingerprints are unique to each of us, in the same way, the way our body works is unique, therefore, it is important for a professional (ND) to assess your optimal individualized treatment plan. The right supplement for you can be expertly addressed by a Naturopathic Physician after careful observation, examination, and interview. 4. PENNY WISE and DOLLAR FOOLISH. \"My Naturopathic Physician's supplements are more expensive than the one I get from the drug store or buyers club\". Yes, sometimes quality means paying a price. Do you want to pay for your health now or later? If you penny pinch on supplements now by getting a poor quality product that is not likely to be effective and may actually cause harm, you are throwing your penny's away and may end up paying for it in hundreds of dollars in medical bills later. Research has shown that taking a multivitamin reduces your risk of hospitalizations and can save you and your insurance company millions. WHY IS A NATUROPATHIC PHYSICIAN THE EXPERT IN NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS? NDs have the education (4 years medical school), experience ( natural therapies), and credentialing ( state license) to make them experts in nutritional supplements. If you want to go to the expert in what pharmaceutical drug is right for you, go to your MD or DO, they have the education, experience, and credentialing to prescribe Drugs. MDs and DOs and DCs are generally not trained in nutrition, nor nutritional supplement, nor herbs and they certainly have not had the training a Naturopathic Physician has had in learning throughout their at least four years of medical school training about what natural supplement, herb, or natural modality is most effective for their patient. If you want to take a nutritional supplement of herb that is safe, effective, and individualized to your needs instead of a pharmaceutical drug for your problem- consult a Naturopath.
