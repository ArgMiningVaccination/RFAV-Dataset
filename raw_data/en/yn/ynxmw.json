As ever this report is a summary of the events, successes, and news of the department during the academic year. The department's year began with the sad news that Professor Mary Hesse passed away on the 2nd of October. Mary Hesse, along with Gerd Buchdal and Michael Hoskin, worked during the early years of the HPS Department's existence, and together they did immense work to turn the department in to the world -class institution that it remains to this day. During her academic car eer, Professor Hesse worked in m athematics at the University of Leeds before becoming a philosopher of science , first at University College London and then in Cambridge , and in her retirement from acadaemia she became an enthusiastic and accomplished historian of the local landscape and agriculture. The annual Garden Party on the 30 th of June 2017 served as a day of memory for Professor Hesse's wide - ranging contributions in all of her pursuits , featuring talks from her colleagues, students, and some of the people she inspired with her work . A programme of the event is available on page 5 . In September 2017 we said goodbye to Anna Jones, who ha d been the librarian of the Whipple Library since 2012. We speak for everyone when we say that Anna has been an enthusiastic, brilliant, friendly, and ever - approachable librarian during her time at the departm ent, and she leaves having overseen many positive changes to the library, as well as managing the rollout of many new University Library systems to the Whipple . We are certain that she will exce l equall y in the next step of her life, as a minister of the Church of England. Her replacement has big shoes to fill , and we look forward to meeting them. Anna's work in the department, along with Katharine Griffiths, Gabriella Zuccolin, Clare Matthews, and Sam Murison, were celebrated with a farewell lunch in the department on Wednesday 19 th July, which we are happy to s ay was attended by as many members of other Cambridge libraries as it was members of the HPS Department. Finally, the author adds a personal thankyou to Anna on behalf of every member of the department with poor library discipline for not having changed the library's 'no overdue fines' policy. We are pleased to report that Hasok Chang has been awarded a British Academy Wolfson Research Professorship, which will provide him with funding for three years in order to work on two books, 'How do es a batter y work?' and 'Realism for Realistic People '. During this time, his teaching committments in the department will be covered by one of the three new Teaching Associates in the coming year, Dr Matt Farr. Matt joins us from the University of Queensland. There are two other Teaching Associates joining the department in September, Dr Agnes Bolinska and Joseph Martin . Dr Bolinska joins us from the University of Wisconsin, and Dr Martin joins us from the 3 Consortium for History of Science, Technology and Medicine in Philadelphia. These new Teaching Associates are helping to cover teaching for the staff members who are on leave in the 2017 -18 academic year and beyond. We welcome them all to the depart ment and wish them all the best. The library and museum, as ever, are integral parts of the HPS Department. The Whipple Library's report is on page 38 , with the Museum's report to follow soon. Finally, on a less academic note, m embers of the admi nistrative, museum, and academic staff went for an afternoon out paintballing during the summer vacation for staff bonding as well as to let off some steam from the academic year. Everyone agreed that it was a great day out, and we hope to do more similar events in the future, so members of staff should keep an eye on their emails! September 2017 Thanks to Dawn Kingham for proof -reading this report.

We said a fond farewell to Anna Jones at the beginning of August 2017. She became Whipple Librarian in March 2012 and h as overseen so many positive changes here. Students and staff from HPS, as well as staff in the wider library community, will sorely miss her. We all wish her luck with her new adventure away from the world of libraries as she trains for ordination in the Church of England. We saw some changes to our team of evening and lunchtime invigilators. Tillmann Taape continued on the team from last year but sadly left in the early part of 2017. Stephen Courtney joined the team at the start of the academic year and also departed for pastures new at the start of July. We welcomed Katharine Griffiths to our team for a few hours each day, thanks to the Department's generosity. She took up the post of Departmental General Assistant in October 2016 and spent her allocated library time working on the front desk and on various other projects. These included the weeding exercise and cataloguing a special collections acquisition. Katharine left us at the start of August and is now enjoying her life in Italy. Toby Bryant, who to ok over Katharine's role as a General Assistant in the department and library, joined us in August . Clare Matthews left the library at the end of September to embark on a PhD, and James Livesey became our new library assistant shortly afterwards. A big thank you to them all. In the wider Cambridge library community, we welcomed Dr Jessica Gardner to the post of University Librarian & Director of Library Services from April 2017. She has been very keen to meet library staff across the University and Anna Jones took up the opportunity to do this. We hope she enjoys her new position at Cambridge and look forward to working with her. We not only said goodbye to staff but also to parts of our collection. A weeding exercise took place in which a number of duplicate copies in the history of philosophy and modern philosophy of science (sections F -H and IA -K in our classification scheme) were withdrawn. We also removed a few large reference works that are now available in electronic form. We have had our speci al collections enlarged with donations from Martin Rudwick and purchases from Jim Secord (see the collections section for more details). The Whipple launched its new website in January 2017. It uses Falcon, the University's Content Management System, and w as meticulously planned in the months previous to its launch by library staff. The website aims to provide a highly usable access point to everything that our library users 40 need, including links to Moodle, iDiscover, LibGuides, and information about our special collections. We hope that the website will continue to develop over time and if anyone has any comments, suggestions, or spots any mistakes, please let us know. Now , a quick look to the future. January 2018 will see the introduction of a new Library Management System (staff will be overheard discussing Alma rather than Voyager). This will have an impact on the first part of 2017- 18 as staff will need to attend further training a dditional to the sessions attended this year. This follows on from the launch of iDiscover in September 2016, which replaced LibrarySearch, as the new way of exploring the libraries catalogues. Collections Our collections have grown this year with around 704 new physical items and 71 new ebooks. On 22 March 2017 we received a large donation from Professor Martin Rudwick consisting of important items in the history of the geological sciences. Among these are Georges Cuvier's Recherches sur les ossem ens fossiles de quadrupedes, several editions of Charles Lyell's Principles of geology , and Martin Lister's monumental volume of copper -plate shells, the Historiae sive synopsis methodicae conchyliorum . These have greatly enriched our collect ions in earth sciences and a selection of items will feature in the Library's contribution to Open Cambridge in September. We also received various books from Professor Jim Secord over the past year. These have included Jane Loudon's The young naturalist , Thomas Squire's A popular grammar of the elements of astronomy, Richard Newton's Nature's mighty wonders, and Eliza Brightwen Inmates of my house and garden . All of these date from the 19 th century and therefore have become wonderful additions to our colle ctions in this area. We also purchased yet another Reverend J.G. Wood book, this time a 3rd edition of Common objects of the microscope , published in 1949 and re -written by W.J. Ferrier. In addition to books, the acquisition of a collection of pamphlets fr om the late 19th and early 20th centuries, once belonging to the Board of Education Library, has enhanced our holdings in the history of science education in Britain. We also brought Dawn a new cataloguing challenge in the form of around 100 ornithological postcards produced by the Brit ish Museum (Natural History) in the 1920s and 1930s (https://whipplelib.wordpress.com/2017/04/05/postcards -the-rda-challenge/ ) The new -look Whipple Libraria n: Anna Jones Library Assistants: Dawn Kingham & Invigilators: Stephen Courtney, Meira Gold, Aga Lanucha, Tillman Taape, Annie Thwaite Training & professional development All permanent members of staff have attended Falcon training to enabl e them to edit the website so it can be developed and kept up- to-date. They have also attended demonstrations of the incoming Library Management System, Alma, with the Librarian attending user testing sessions as well. As staff in the UL and Affiliated Lib raries are migrating over to Outlook for their email and calendar system, Whipple staff went to brief sessions which described the migration process and allowed those of us who had not used Outlook Exchange before to have a basic demonstration. The Librari es@Cambridge conference took place in January 2017. Clare and Anna attended this event, which asked \"Are you a Library Superhero?\", and benefitted from a variety of sessions, including on emergency planning, knowledge management, conservation, and how to c ope when things don't go quite as expected. Staff have also continued to keep their health and safety training current by attending Evacuation Chair and Stair Climber Refresher courses. We have taken part in online training too, which all University staff are encouraged to do at the start of each academic year, involving fire safety and diversity. Anna attended a number of training courses over the year, including \"Mapping your Workflow\" and \"Effective Teams\", run by the Library in Training Team. She also attended meetings about Open Access and Scholarly Communications. She continued to be involved in Journal Co- ordination, the 42 E-book group, attended meetings of the UL Events and Outreach Committee, co- organised sessions on Image Copyright and Planning Rese arch Trips (part of combined SHSS & SAH graduate training series), and prepared material on working with special collections (print & MS) for Graduate showcase (March 2017). Dawn has mainly concentrated on cataloguing this year, by attending the forum RDA: 3 Years Later, a lecture on BibFrame and the training course Specialist Cataloguing -Maps, Music and Kits. She also attended a Webinar in July about OpenAccess. Clare attended sessions of the Historic Libraries Forum Annual Conference on \"Impact: new audie nces for historic collections\" in November 2016. Katharine attended a course entitled Software skills for Librarians, which consisted of four sessions in April 2017. User Education Science in Print It was another successful year for Sci ence in Print, with a total of 13 participants. The Michaelmas term saw Roger Gaskell and Anna Jones running 4 sessions on book production in the hand press period, which included a trip to the University Library's Historical Printing and Rare Books Rooms. The Lent term saw sessions run by Drs. Sarah Bull and James Poskett on book production in the 19 th and 20th centuries. These sessions allow graduate students and post -docs in HPS and other subjects to gain some hands -on experience of examining and handling books. The experience also generated a blog post from Anna Gielas, where she has reviewed the sessions from Lent term (https://whipplelib.wordpress.com/2017/0 7/14/reflections -on-science -in-print-ii/). Induction tours These ran as normal at the start of the academic year. There were general tours and more focused ones aimed at specific student cohorts. All tours give incomers a chance to have a look round the library and an introduction to the services that we offer. We also provided introductions to the 43 library on a one -to-one basis when required. These usually took place when new student or academic visitors joined the Department. Outreach & Public Events Displays We have had a nice range of book displays in the special cases on Level one. These have been \"Writing Science: interpreters, educators, scholars\" (November 2016- April 2017), which exhibited material on a wide range of topics by women who were schol ars, educators and interpreters of scientific information from the mid -18th to the early -20th centuries, and \"...it is not difficult to define a Bird\" (April -June 2017), featuring the British Museum postcards and books relating to ornithology. Our final display of the year \"Staging the History of Science: an exhibit in three acts\" was prepared by Julia Ostmann and Alona Bach, two of the Department's MPhil students. The display explores theatrical representations of three significant themes in the history of s cience - Astronomy, Newtonianism and Radioactivity - by juxtaposing theatrical scripts and memorabilia alongside texts from the Whipple's special collections that expound the related scientific ideas. The display was launched at the beginning of June with a special evening event featuring staged readings from some of the plays. Online versions of our book displays can be seen on our website: http://www.whipplelib.hps.cam.ac .uk/special/exhibitions -and-displays In September 2016 our theme for Open Cambridge was space travel, and the Old Library saw a display of works dating from the 17th to the 20th century, covering globes and orreries, studies of the sun, moon and planets, and exploring ideas of life on Mars and interplanetary travel. For the Science Festival in March 2017, Clare also represented the Library with a display of some lesser known items in our collections at the \"Why is this here?\" event, and with a selection o f microscopy books for a family activity day, themed \"Customised and Invented\", both held in the Whipple Museum. 44 Above and previous page: p hotos from the 'Staging the History of Science' launch Schools sessions and visits Clare and Anna continued to work with the Museum Learning Co- ordinator, Rosanna Evans, to deliver a number of sessions of the now well -developed \"Medicine and Anatomy through time\" and \"Darwin, Evolution and the The Origin of Species \" workshops. Clare also hosted a session on \"Women in Astronomy\" for students visiting from Kutztown University, Pennsylvania, in January 2017. Anna welcomed the Graduate Trainees from Cambridge libraries on their annual visit to the Whipple in March, and in July, hosted a group for a \"Tea and Talk\" session in the Museum on Robert Whipple as a collector. Blog Our blog has continued to grow over the year. Although a little behind schedule, we completed the A-Z posts focusing on items from the special collections in December 2016, providing a nice starting point to delve into our collections. Other posts have discussed the cataloguing of the new acquisition of postcards produced by the British Museum, books displayed at the 1951 Festival of Britain and the collection of science educ ation pamphlets. Two posts were related to the work of Robert Fludd: our recent acquisition of his Philosophia Moysaica, and Fludd's influence on Robert Hooke. 45 INDIVIDUALS Annual Reports of M embers of the Department Anna Alexandrova This year I enjoyed giving a new lecture course called Philosophy of Economics. It was available to students across four tripos (HPS, Economics, Philosophy, and Human, Social, and Political Sciences). Along with Stephen John I continued to direct the Limits of Numerical Gran t at CRASSH. We also started a new project \"Values and the Science of Intelligence\" at the Leverhulme Centre For Future of Intelligence. The members of the European Philosophy of Science Association elected me as member of the Steering Committee; I have also been elected as Member of Council of the Royal Institute of Philosophy.

In professional service, I continued to focus on the cause of integrated history and philosophy of science. I have served as the Chair of the Executive Board of the I nternational Committee for Integrated HPS since the summer of 2015, and maintained a key role in the UK Integrated HPS Network. I have also been chairing the history -philosophy Joint Commission of the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science and Technology (IUHPST). In other service, I have continued on the governing Council of the Society for H istory of Alchemy and Chemistry, also agreeing to serve as D eputy Chairman of the S ociety from 2017. For most of this academic year I have also served as the Acting Chair of the Management Committee for the Lakatos Aw ard in the Philosophy of Science. During the Michaelmas Term I carried out a full load of lecturing and supervising, and throughout the academic year I continued to look after a large number of PhD students. I continued with organising the Coffee with Scie ntists seminar group in Michaelmas Term, before handing over to Marta Halina when I went on sabbatical. My collaborative agreement with the Department of Chemistry continue s, and was renewed for another 3 years in August 2016. I remain a Fellow of Clare Hall, and I also continued my service as the external DoS for HPS at St Catharine's College.

Helen Anne Curry This year I served as Part III Manager and Part IB Senior Examiner, and continued in my role s as Director of Studies in HPS for Churchill College (where I am a Fellow) and HPS representative on the NST Management Committee. I am particularly proud of having organized the first -ever seri es of HPS IA lectures in Lent, with several intrepid HPS teaching officers volunteering to be guinea pigs for this new teaching endeavor. My first book, Evolution Made to Order : Plant Breeding and Technological Innovation in Twentieth -century America , was published in November 2016, and I was delighted to have a book launch at the Whipple Museum in celebration. I was involved in co - organizing a two- part, international, interdisciplinary conference series on \"Biodiversity and Its Histories,\" which took place in March and April 2017, at CRAASH, University of Cambridge 58 (March), and the University of Columbia and New York Botanical Garden (April). With the support of a Seed Award from the Wellcome Trust and the invaluable input and assistance of postdoctoral researcher Sara Peres, I pushed forward with the research project \"Seeds for Survival: A Global History of Seed Banking.\" As part of our quest to assemble the materials and knowledge needed for launching a major research initative on this topic, we visited si x seed collections of varying age, scope, and aim: the Commonwealth Potato Collection (Dundee, UK), the genebank of the John Innes Center (Norwich, UK), the Heritage Seed Library of Garden Organic (Ryton, UK), the United States National Laboratory for Gene tic Resources Preservation (Denver, Colorado, USA), the seed bank at Navdanya Biodiversity Conservation Farm (Doon Valley, U ttarakhand , India), and the maize and wheat genebanks of the International Center for the Improvement of Maize and Wheat (El Bat\u00e1n, Mexico). We also hosted an international workshop on the history and sociology of genetic resources conservation at HPS in June 2017, which brought together established and junior scholars currently working in this area for two days of lively discussion and debate.

There is tea beforehand from 3pm in Seminar Room 1. Organised by Mary Brazelton and Marta Halina. 13 October Robbie Duschinsky and Sophie Reijman (Public Health and Primary Care, Cambridge) 'Patterning within the disturbance of coherence': the practical work of measuring and classifying infant disorganised attachment 'Disorganised attachment' (Main and Solomon 1990) is a classification made of infant -caregiver relationships in the Ainsworth Strange Situation, and is among the most influential assessments of infant mental health. It is made on the basis of observations of out -of-context, unexpected, or anomalous behaviours shown by an infant on reunion with their c aregiver after a brief separation. This classification has received a high degree of interest, from researchers, clinicians and social workers, as well as policy makers. Disorganised attachment has primarily been understood through the lens of the Hesse an d Main's concept of 'fright without solution', taken to mean that an infant experiences a conflict between a desire to approach and flee from a parent who frightens them. This talk draws from a wider project, funded by an Investigator Award from the Wellco me Trust, studying debates around disorganised infant attachment and their implications for clinicians and social workers. The specific focus of the paper will be on the practical work of measuring and classifying infant -caregiver attachment relationships, drawing on interviews, archival research, and participant observation. The paper will reflect particularly on the significance of sharp disparities found between conventional, circulating accounts of disorganised attachment and coders' practical theories of behaviour and relationship processes. 20 October Harry Collins (Cardiff University) Some sociological aspects of the detection of gravitational waves What is the sociologist, who has spent years demonstrating the interpretative flexibility of claims to have detected gravitational waves, to make of a detection that no -one will question? And where did the confidence in that detection come from - not quite where you think! 27 October Emma Tobin (UCL) Mechanisms and natural kinds In the classification literature, there has been much discussion of the no- overlap principle, which allows a categorical distinction between natural kinds from a realist perspective. However, cases 87 of crosscutting natural kinds in scientific practice provide a serious challenge t o the no -overlap principle (Khalidi, 1998, Dupre 1993, Tobin 2010). The HPC view of natural kinds has emerged in order to accommodate the fuzzy boundaries we associate with clusters of properties, by the introduction of a homeostatic regulating mechanism. Craver (2009) claims that there is a difficulty in deciding where a particular mechanism begins and another ends. The strategy of lumping and splitting is designed in order to accommodate the no overlap principle; namely if you find that a single cluster o f properties is regulated by more than one mechanism, then because there can be no overlap between mechanisms, then we must split the natural clusters. However, a closer analysis of dynamic mechanisms in scientific practice reveal that the overlap problem re-emerges with the strategy of lumping and splitting in that there is an assumption that once a mechanism is found to be responsible for a property cluster, that this is sufficient for delineating the boundaries of that cluster. Scientific practice reveal s that there might be multiple causal routes that could result in a similar functional output. Moreover, there might be different kinds of mechanisms, which produce the same property cluster and depending on which one we are using, the decision to lump or split may be different. The paper concludes with some observations about the implications for the classification of mechanisms and to the additional question as to whether mechanisms are themselves natural kinds. 10 November Giovanna Colombetti (University of Exeter) Embodied and situated moods There is a certain tendency, among affective neuroscientists, to present the brain as the physical basis, or 'core machinery', of moods (sometimes even to claim that moods are 'in the brain'). In my talk I will criticise this brain -centric view of moods. Empirical evidence shows that brain activity not only modulates, but is in turn continuously modulated by, physical activity taking place in other parts of the organism (such as the endocrine and the immun e system). It is therefore not clear why the core machinery of moods ought to be restricted to the brain. I propose, accordingly, that moods are best conceived as embodied rather than just 'embrained', i.e., their physical basis should be enlarged so as to comprise not just brain but also bodily activity. Second, I emphasise that moods are situated in the world. By this I do not just mean that moods are influenced by the world (an uncontroversial claim), but that they are complexly interrelated with it, in at least three different ways: i) they are shaped by cultural values and norms, ii) they are materially and intersubjectively 'scaffolded', and iii) they can even come to 'experientially incorporate' parts of the world, i.e., include the experience of part s of the world as parts of oneself. 17 November Richard Powell (University of Oxford) The hubris of youth? Oxford, Cambridge and the Arctic, c.1920 -1940 During the interwar period, the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge sent successive expeditions to t he Arctic, mainly focusing on Nordauslandet (North East Land in the Svalbard archipelago) and Greenland. These expeditions have been rather neglected by historians, save for some celebratory work by former protagonists. This paper investigates some of thei r legacies, both in terms of their scientific contribution and in their impacts on particular Inuit communities. It focuses specifically on psychological experiments conducted on the people of Illorsuit in the late 1930s. In investigating this, some of the se expeditionary activities complicate a number of historiographical assumptions about the nature of Greenlandic governance, the role of universities in the field sciences and the wider development of the disciplines of Arctic study. 88 This discussion also provides for heuristic reflection in recent attempts to de -colonise the curriculum at both universities. 24 November Twelfth Cambridge Wellcome Lecture in the History of Medicine Alexandra Minna Stern (University of Michigan) Eugenic sterilization in California: from demographic analysis to digital storytelling From 1909 to 1979, California sterilized more than 20,000 patients in state homes and hospitals. This lecture draws from new interdisciplinary research into the history of sterilization, presen ting both overarching demographic trends that illustrate the intersectional racial, gender, and diagnostic biases of compulsory reproductive surgery, and the experiences of people whose lives were irrevocably changed by this medical intervention. These new findings are drawn from a dataset that I and my team created after digitizing more than 50,000 microfilm documents that had been long forgotten in the file cabinets of state agencies in Sacramento, California. This lecture asks how an in -depth interdiscip linary study of patterns and experiences of sterilization confirms and challenges historical understandings of eugenics, and highlights the value of epidemiological and demographic methods in historical analysis. The presentation also provides an overview of the digital archive we are creating that will feature data visualization and digital storytelling. Twentieth Century Think Tank The Twentieth Century Think Tank offers broad coverage of 20th- and 21st -century topics in the history, philosophy and soci ology of science, technology and medicine. The regular programme of papers and discussions takes place on Thursdays over lunch. Think Tank meetings are held on Thursdays, 1 -2pm in Seminar Room 2 . All welcome! Organised by Richard Staley, Mary Brazelton, He len Curry and Susanne Schmidt. This term we explore a variety of perspectives on global studies and histories of science and technology, and Think Tank presentations will be complemented by readings on related topics in the Twentieth Century Reading Group , which meets on alternate Thursdays. 6 October Sloan Mahone (University of Oxford) Images as artefacts: film, photography and repatriation in Kenya This discussion focuses on the conceptual and methodological issues at play when working with images from the past. Utilising a photographic case study from East Africa, we consider historical context, provenance, and intent. A series of photographs taken or ob tained by Canadian psychiatrist Edward L. Margetts in Kenya in the 1950s allow for a broad discussion of what photographs mean; for the photographer, the viewer, and most poignantly, the 89 photographic subjects. We will work through a set of images of the an cient surgical practice of trepanning the skull which was still being performed controversially in the 1950s in one region of Kenya. The traditional practice, often extreme in its medical outcomes, was filmed, photographed and even immortalized in soap sto ne carvings. The wildly divergent uses and interpretations of one set of images prompts us to ask questions about the use, re -use and misuse of images over time. Suggested reading: Sloan Mahone, '\"Hat -on, Hat -off\": Trauma and Trepanation Kisii, western Kenya', Journal of Eastern African Studies , 2014. 20 October Matei Candea (Social Anthropology, Cambridge) Comparative uncertainties: comparing comparisons in anthropology and animal behaviour science Much has been made in recent years of the way in which anthropological confrontations with alterity can generate productive conceptual uncertainty. This methodological device can be thought of as a type of 'frontal' comparison in which a 'them' position is confronted to an 'us' position. This paper contr asts frontal comparison with lateral comparisons, in which different cases are laid side by side. Frontal and lateral comparisons produce different and complementary dynamics of conceptual uncertainty and productive doubt. This anthropological pair is in t urn compared with and read through two different ways of managing uncertainty in a different discipline: the study of animal behaviour. 27 October David Munns (John Jay College) A controlled environment: phytotrons, Cold War life science, and the making of the experimental plant My talk tells of the quest to gain scientific and technological mastery over the environment in the life sciences. Because living things are a product of their genes and their environments, alongside the famed discovery of genes there was the simultaneous discovery of the biological environment. To experiment on the biological environment plant scientists built wonders of twentieth century life science and environmental engineering: now forgotten laboratories called 'phytotrons'. To create phytotrons, biologists became technologists because to learn about plants and animals meant learning about the technological systems that replicated and monitored their development. In the Cold War they revealed the shape of the environment, the limits of growth and development, and the limits of control over complex systems. There is no better time to remember the science of the biological environment amid the challenge of climate change. When Los Angeles choked on smog in the 1940s, city officia ls turned to the new phytotron at Caltech for answers. Experiments proved the harmful effects of smog on plants and people which lead to the initial efforts to curb air pollution. Now, a half century later, the phytotron's successors called biotrons and ec otrons are discovering connections between life and a changing environment. I can only hint at the larger history of 'trons' that replicated the worldview of the Cold War era in both phytotrons, biotrons, climatrons, and ecotrons as well as in cyclotrons, and bevatrons. Indeed, from the algatron to the zootron, the history of science since 1945 is a world of trons. 17 November Shinjini Das (CRASSH, Cambridge) A science in translation: homoeopathy in colonial Bengal 90 Over the years, robust and d ivergent strands of South Asian scholarship have studied the relationship between science, medicine and colonialism. The translation of western medical texts into South Asian vernacular languages under the patronage of the colonial state has received consi derable attention. What has not been explored adequately, however, is the participation of Indians themselves in processes of scientific translation. As an instance of a western science that the colonial state attempted to censor, the popular practices of translation around homoeopathy provide a distinct narrative of western science's colonial reception. This paper traces the efforts of some late nineteenth -century Indian pharmaceutical -firms to translate homoeopathy for a vernacular Bengali audience. It ex plores the domestication and indigenisation of homoeopathy, with its roots in Germany, in Bengal, through such acts of scientific translation. The paper shows that at one level translation reified the power and superiority of western science and language (mostly English) as global and universal categories. Simultaneously, these Bengali translations contested the universal status of western science by reinterpreting homoeopathy as profane, local and indigenous to Bengal. 1 December Hanna Lucia Worliczek (Un iversity of Vienna) Imaging the cytoskeleton - re-defining a biological entity with fluorescent antibodies This paper traces a substantial visual end epistemic change in cell biology research in the early 1970s, initiated by the adoption of fluorescence m icroscopy, using antibodies for labelling proteins, from diagnostic research on viral and bacterial pathogens. With the first paper applying this method to cytoskeleton research, published 1974 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, a new kind of visual evidence got established in a field, which until then was dominated by electron microscopy as the most important imaging technique. As I will show, the application and establishment of fluorescence microscopy not only re -defined t he cytoskeleton as a biological entity of similar importance as other already well -described organelles like the nucleus, the Golgi apparatus or the endoplasmic reticulum. It furthermore facilitated a new iconography of the cell and a significant epistemic change: it was now possible to stain proteins specifically in fixed cells, allowing the visualization of the molecular architecture of various cell components in situ. Based on manuscripts, published articles and textbooks, editorial archives, papers of t he American Society for Cell Biology, as well as interviews with researchers, technology developers and editors, I aim to reconstruct and understand how a new kind of image could be established as central evidence for findings and hypotheses and how the associated visual knowledge shaped the field of cell biology. Coffee with Scientists The aim of this group is to explore and enhance the interface between HPS and science. Though many of us in HPS engage closely with science and scientists, we could benefit from more explicit discussions about the relationship between HPS and science itself, and from more opportunities for HPS -scholars and scientists to help each other's work. 91 During Michaelmas Term 2016 we will continue to meet on Fridays, 3.30-5.00p m in Seminar Room 2 . Further information and reading materials will be distributed through the email list of the group; please contact Hasok Chang (hc372) if you would like to be included on the list. 7 October Peter Woodford (Faculty of Divinity) and Arik Kershenbaum (Department of Zoology) A philosopher among the scientists: a dialogue on the evolution of cooperation and cognition 21 October David Teplow (Professor of Neurology and Director of Biopolymer Laboratory, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles) The black hole of philosophy of science: how the light of understanding is captured by natural kinds 18 November Elizabeth Murchison, Annabelle Bates, Andrea Strakova (Department of Veterinary Medicine), and David Feller (Research Operations Office) The history of canine transmissible cancers Cabinet of Natural History This research seminar is concerned with all aspects of the history of natural history and the field and environmental sciences.

Organised by Edwin Rose (edr24). 10 October Matthew Wale (University of Leicester) 'Why do entomologists want a weekly newspaper?': periodicals and the practice of nineteenth- century natural history 'Why do entomologists want a weekly newspaper?' was a question posed by the first issue of the Entomologist's Weekly Intelligencer in April 1856. Established and edited by the eminent entomologist Henry Tibbats Stainton, this was the first weekly periodical dedicated to the study of insects. Stainton pointed to the advantages of such a publication, citing speed and efficiency of communication, surpassing the slower and more laborious task of personal correspondence. To th is end, the bulk of the Intelligencer 's contents consisted of notes and observations received 92 from a host of insect collectors around the country, establishing an entomological community unprecedented in size and scope. The nineteenth century saw a rapid i ncrease in the number of periodicals dedicated to the varying branches of natural history, and this paper will seek to address the wider implications of this through detailed study of the Intelligencer . It will draw upon Stainton's extensive correspondence archive, in addition to the periodical itself, in order to demonstrate the complex relationship between the periodical and the practice of natural history, focusing on such activities as field work, collecting and correspondence. Particular attention will be given to the ways in which such periodicals allowed for much wider participation in the creation and circulation of scientific knowledge, with Stainton himself actively encouraging the pursuit of entomology amongst the working -classes. 17 October Jessica Ratcliff (Cornell University and Yale- NUS College) The natural history of the Napoleonic Wars: collecting at the East India Company c. 1798-1820 At the turn of the nineteenth century, at its headquarters in the City of London, the East India Company e stablished a new museum. By mid -century, the museum at India House had grown to contain one of Europe's most extensive collections of the natural history, arts and sciences of Asia. This talk uses the museum's early natural history collections to explore t he material relationship between scientific practice and imperial conflict. I will first describe some of the ways in which the Asian theatres of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars would shape the scope and scale of the East India Company's collections. I will then consider one particular case: the British invasion of Dutch Java (1811) the collecting activities of Thomas Horsfield and Stamford Raffles, and the uses to which those Javanese collections were put. Such cases raise the question of how and why the practices of war came to encompass natural history surveys during this period. I will conclude by offering a few tentative answers to that question. 24 October Annual Fungus Hunt 31 October Jordan Goodman (UCL) After Cook: Joseph Banks and his travelling natures, 1787-1810 The death of Captain James Cook in February 1779 deprived Britain of one of its finest navigators but the voyage continued. For Joseph Banks, the voyage of the Resolution and the Discovery , in which he had a part, was the beginning of a new relationship with the Admiralty and a new chapter in the history of botanical knowledge. Banks never went to sea again after 1773. For the rest of his life the sea was at the heart of what he loved to do most. From 1778, when he was elec ted President of the Royal Society, Banks intervened in all of the Admiralty voyages of exploration making them his kind of scientific project: he selected vital personnel, including gardeners, botanists and artists; he wrote out instructions for commander s; and most importantly, he changed the architecture of the ships by commandeering space, by turning them into 'floating gardens', moving plants from one part of the world to the other, and supplying King George III's Royal Gardens at Kew with exotic plant s unique in Europe. But it wasn't just Admiralty ships that saw the visible hand of Banks. In 1798, the East India Company agreed to let Banks use one of their ships to move plants between Kew and Calcutta, an unprecedented and successful project. With sim ilar techniques, Banks moved plants between Kew and Canton from 1803 and 1810. 93 This paper on the world of Banks and his travelling natures will draw on two Admiralty voyages and one East India Company voyage. 7 November David Harris Sacks (Reed College) Learning to know: the educations of Richard Hakluyt and Thomas Harriot Richard and (1560 -1621), ethnographer, mathematician, natural philosopher and polymath, were explorers and discovers in their era's newly -opened territories of study. Both were consumers of learning and producers of knowledge and both sought the truth insofar as human reason could grasp it. Both also contributed to the formation of what we know as modern science with its di stinctive ethos of debate and proof. This paper focuses on their educations and experiences, mainly in Oxford, as they began their careers of inquiry into the 'Book of Nature'. Along with considering the role played by humanist learning in shaping their st udies of the natural world, attention will be given to Oxford's conflicted religious and cultural climate relates and how it relates to their goals, which Hakluyt defined as 'the certain and full discovery of the world'. For Hakluyt the 'world' was the ear th as divinely created. For Harriot, who contributed to a diversity of fields, the 'world' was the universe, a new usage in the period, which took in the heavens as well as the earth. Both men shared an eirenical religious outlook, encouraged by their expe riences in Oxford as well as their teachers, and both came to understand their studies of nature to represent a realm of intellectual peace where doubts could be overcome, disagreements could be reconciled, and it would be possible to know the truth with c ertainty using the senses as well as reason. 14 November Anja -Silvia Goeing (Visiting Fellow, Harvard University) Conrad Gessner, the Zurich Lectorium, and the study of physics and medicine in the early modern world Conrad Gessner's approach towards the world and mankind was centred on his preoccupation with the human soul, an object of study that had challenged classical writers such as Aristotle and Galen, and which remained as important in post -Reformation debate . Writing commentaries on Aristotle's De Anima (On the Soul) was part of early -modern physics education at university and formed the preparatory step for studying medicine. I will use the case study of Gessner's commentary on De Anima to explore how Gessner's readers prioritised De Anima 's infor mation. Gessner's intention was to provide the students of philosophy and medicine with the most current and comprehensive thinking, whether in physics or in medicine. His readers' responses raise questions about evolving discussions in physics and medicin e, and Gessner's part in helping these develop. 21 November Lisa Skogh (Victoria & Albert Museum) The mine as a subterranean Kunstkammer Similar to how the princely gardens and its collections should be seen as an outdoor extension of the Kunstkammer, so could also the princely mines be interpreted. They all formed part of the over-all concept of an early modern elite setting where the mines were central in its association to the display of power, knowledge and rulership. This paper will present the conne ction between collecting and mining represented in the Kunstkammer from the perspective of the learned male ruler as well as his learned consort. Material wealth provided not only the possibility 94 to create a Kunstkammer it directly influenced how the miner al resources were reflected in the patronage, hence it played a crucial role as an economic platform. As such, the idea of the mines as a subterranean Kunstkammer opens up different areas of collecting and sources of knowledge not the least in reference to the early modern F\u00fcrstin as a patron and collector. 28 November Daniel Simpson (Royal Holloway, University of London) Ethnographic collecting and the despotism of Joseph Banks While Joseph Banks is generally thought to have been an effective scientific patron, things were not always so. In 1784, several disaffected members of the Royal Society printed a remarkably angry pamphlet which accused Banks, their president, of numerous acts of 'despotic' behaviour quite unwarranted in a man who, in their opinion , possessed only 'puny pretensions' to his position. While Banks might make 'a very good Clerk', they offered, 'the man who is to fill the place of President, should be something more'. In this talk, I explore such thinking on Banks' very particular brand of scientific patronage in terms of its impact upon the development of a subject which he did not much like. Although an avid collector of artificial curiosities on board the first expedition of Captain Cook, there is little evidence that Banks encouraged the subsequent development of object collecting as a subset of natural history, or as a means of colonial knowledge; in fact, he seems to have done much to frustrate the all -embracing mode of natural historical enquiry in which such study found legitimacy. By focusing in particular upon Banks' relationship and correspondence with colonial officials and scientific elites in late eighteenth -century Australia (the continent, perhaps, in which he was most invested), I argue that the nascent ethnographic studies favoured by imperial administrators as well as amateur explorers were gradually undermined by the enduring appeal of collecting according to the Banksian hierarchy. Our understanding of early Aboriginal Australia, I conclude, has never quite recovered. 95 History of Modern Medicine and Biology Organised by Mary Brazelton, Helen Anne Curry and Nick Hopwood. 11 October Claas Kirchhelle (University of Oxford) The Colindale typers: bacteriophage and the British Public Health Laboratory Service 8 November Ed J uler (Newcastle University) The life of forms: biology and modernist sculpture 29 November Susanne Schmidt (HPS, Cambridge) The anti -feminist construction of the 'midlife crisis' Early Medicine Organised by Lauren Kassell and D\u00e1niel October Anna Winterbottom (University of Sussex) The foreigner's disease: global perspectives on syphilis in early modernity 15 November Pierre -Etienne Stockland (Columbia University) From Petite Chimie to industrial chemistry: insecticides in France from the Ol d Regime to the Industrial Revolution (1750 -1830) 22 November D\u00e1niel Marg\u00f3csy (HPS, Cambridge) Reading Vesalius 700 times: the problem of generation and the reception history of De humani corporis fabrica Generation to Reproduction These seminars are funded by our Wellcome Trust strategic award in the history of medicine .

In the first NJ will give an overview of the formation of history of science as a discipline. Then HC and NJ will debate the problems of anachronism faced by historians of science. Subsequent meetings will address the historiography of the French historian of chemistry H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Metzger (Cristina Chimisso, Open University), the uses of case - studies in the history of science (HC), the roles of sympathy and antipathy in historical biographies (NJ), and approaches to the history of cross -cultural communication in the sciences (NJ). Those participating in these seminars are likely to find interesting the meetings of the History and Theory Reading Group . 24 October Nick Jardine: The formation of history of science This first session will start with a sketch the ways in which history of science became established as a disc ipline. There will then be an overview of some of the main approaches that have dominated the field over the past century: positivist narratives of scientific progress, social histories of the sciences, cultural histories, and global histories.

Should this be the historian's aim? Is history of science relevant to current philosophy and science? These are some of the questions that the historian of chemistry H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Metzger (Chatou, France, 1889 - Auschwitz, 1944) aimed to an swer.

This session will consider some of the theoretical frameworks that have been employed in such studies. It will be suggested that the term 'global' is potentially misleading , given that many of the most significant studies have focussed on local negotiations and exchanges. In conclusion, it will be argued that the focus on communication and exchange of knowledge rather than the establishment of consensus has led to historiogr aphical and philosophical confusion.

Scholarly Practice, Style and the Digital What has the arrival of digital and network technologies done to styles of scholarship? This question has been asked of scientific practice by historians of science - by Jon Agar, Bruno Strasser and others. But technological change affects historians just as much as it does scie ntists, and so we wish to extend the analysis to our own practice. Using the concept of research 'style', we will discuss texts that reflect on scholarly practice, that deal with the arrival and development of digital and networked technologies, and that c ombine the two. To give structure to the year's reading we will follow the life -cycle of a piece of scholarly work, looking at Research in Michaelmas, Production/Authorship in Lent, and Audience/Users in Easter.

There is tea beforehand from 3pm in Seminar Room 1. Organised by Mary Brazelton and Marta Halina. 26 Januar y James Sumner (University of Manchester) Garbage in, garbage out? A history of representations of computers in popular media A variety of recent scholarship has traced the development of popular science through print media sources, exploring how characterizations of scientific phenomena evolve through interactions between authors' agendas, audience responses, and changes in publishing culture. Studies so far have tended to focus on 19th- century cases, seeking the origins of the familiar boundaries of 'science in public'. Here I apply similar considerations to an inescapably 20th - century phenomenon: the electronic digital computer. The vision of computers as profoundly new and world- changing endured over a paradoxically long period, from the mid- 1940s to the 1980s, in newspapers, magazines and an ever -growing range of introductory books. Although some authors harnessed the blank -slate rhetoric to revolutionary social, economic or educational manifestos, the conceptual content of the literature overal l was interestingly conservative, returning repeatedly to a default stock of narratives, justifications and analogies. Some of these representations originated in wider, older discourses: fears that computers would destroy white -collar jobs were an obvious reincarnation of pre -digital tensions over mechanized deskilling. Others were consciously introduced to shape expectations: industry sources promoted awareness of the GIGO principle ('garbage in, garbage out') to affirm the technology as a neutral tool, d oing only and precisely what it was told. Still others seem to have persisted by default without much underpinning intent: the remorseless tendency to explain binary arithmetic, to all audiences and for all purposes, endured for half a century. Ultimately, I argue, 'computing' in the popular imagination was only to a limited degree a product of its time. 2 February Andy Clark (University of Edinburgh) Only predict? Conscious experience, and the scope and limits of predictive processing The 'predictive pro cessing' framework shows great promise as a means of both understanding and integrating many of the core information processing strategies underlying perception, thought and action. But this leaves many questions unanswered. What, if anything, does this deeply probabilistic framework have to say about the nature of daily human experience and (indeed) the nature and possibility of conscious experience more generally? Can a story that posits prediction error minimization as cognitive bedrock accommodate the u ndoubted attractions of novelty and exploration? Is it falsifiable? What is the true scope of this story - can it really be a theory of 'everything cognitive'? 108 9 February Tara Nummedal (Brown University) Emblematic alchemy: Michael Maier's Atalanta fugien s (1617/18) Written by the German physician, courtier and alchemist Michael Maier, Atalanta fugiens (1617/18) offers its readers an alchemical interpretation of the Classical myth of Atalanta as a series of fifty emblems, each containing an image, motto a nd epigram (in German and Latin), an accompanying fugue (or canon) for three voices, and a Latin discourse explicating the emblem's alchemical meaning. The parts of each emblem and the 214 -page quarto book as a whole are meant to work together, with the mu sic, image and text as an interlocking guide to alchemical theory and to the production of the philosophers' stone. In this talk, I will explore the role of sight and image in Maier's alchemical epistemology and situate his book in the visual culture of early modern European alchemy. 16 February Marion Vorms (Birkbeck, University of London) On reasonable doubt Jurors in criminal trials are instructed to bring a verdict of 'guilty' if and only if they estimate that guilt has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt (BARD). This standard of proof raises intriguing epistemological and psychological issues, in addition to judicial ones. In this talk, I will take the juror's situation as a model for everyday reasoner and decision -maker, and try to extend the notion of reasonable doubt as a norm of reasoning and decision- making under uncertainty more generally. One important, and hard question, is how to draw a clear boundary between reasonable, and unreasonable doubts. After proposing a basic decision- theoretic acc ount of 'reasonable doubt', I will challenge it on several grounds, which will lead me to clarify the picture of belief states and dynamics we need in order to account for this notion. 23 February Jonathan Birch (LSE) Animal sentience and human values The science of animal welfare provides an important context in which to consider the role ethical values should, or should not, play in setting appropriate burdens of proof. For example, if animals of a particular species can feel pain, but we fail to accept that they can feel pain when formulating animal welfare regulations, negative welfare consequences are likely to ensue. This has led a number of animal welfare scientists to argue that, with respect to contested invertebrate taxa such as cephalopods, deca pods and cyclostomes, the precautionary principle should be applied and the burden of proof should be set intentionally low. However, this proposal has met with resistance from the biomedical research community. I offer a philosophical perspective on this controversy, and I attempt to extract some wider lessons regarding the relationship between science and values. 2 March Seminar cancelled 9 March William Ashworth (University of Liverpool) The gifts of Athena revisited: protectionism, regulation and the British Industrial Revolution, 1700-1800 109 The British Industrial Revolution has long been seen as the spark for modern, global industrialisation and sustained economic growth. The emphasis of this paper is upon the British state and its fundamental role in the development of domestic manufactures, importantly, those at the heart of the country's precocious industrial trajectory over the course of the 18th century. This significantly dilutes the current popular view that it was a result of a unique rational culture and a set of favourable institutions. 16 March Deborah Coen (Columbia University) Climate in word and image: science and the Austrian idea One of the most urgent challenges of climate research today is that of conceptualizing interactions across scales of space and time. In her book in progress, Deborah Coen examines how this problem was addressed in the late Habsburg Monarchy, where scientis ts developed an unprecedented conceptual apparatus for tracking the transfer of energy from the molecular scale to the planetary. Her presentation will offer an overview of this project. The central argument is that these innovations arose in part as a sol ution to a problem of representation, a problem that engaged Habsburg scientists as servants of a supranational state. The problem was to represent local differences while producing a coherent overview; that is, to do justice to the vaunted diversity of th e Habsburg lands while reinforcing the impression of unity. This problem was worked out at the interface between physical and human geography, and it stimulated technical innovations across a range of media, from cartography, to landscape painting, to fict ion and poetry, to mathematical physics, while also shaping political discourse. In this way, Climate in Word and Image writes the history of climate science as a history of scaling: the process of mediating between different systems of measurement, formal and informal, designed to apply to different slices of the phenomenal world, in order to arrive at a common standard of proportionality. A focus on scaling emphasizes not only the cognitive work of commensuration, but also the corporeal, emotional and soc ial effort that goes into recalibrating our sense of the near in relation to the far. Twentieth Century Think Tank The Twentieth Century Think Tank offers broad coverage of 20th- and 21st -century topics in the history, philosophy and sociology of science , technology and medicine. The regular programme of papers and discussions takes place on Thursdays over lunch. Think Tank meetings are held on Thursdays, 1 -2pm in Seminar Room 2 . All welcome! Organised by Richard Staley, Mary Brazelton, Helen Curry and Susanne Schmidt. This term we will be exploring the interrelations between science and development, in conjunction with readings and discussion of this theme in the Twentieth Century Reading Group , which meets on alternate Thursdays. 110 2 February Simone Turchetti (University of Manchester) The greening alliance: environment, development and the North- Atlantic Treaty Organization Scholars focussing on 20th century international development programmes have revealed how they often aligned to a diplomacy agenda (especially during the Cold War) and modernist stances underscoring the merits of science and technology in treating under -development. But NATO, the foremost defence alliance in the Western world, has so far been virtually absent from these reflections. This paper considers how, from the late 1960s and following one of its major crises, development and environmental degradation took centre -stage in debates within the alliance. And it documents attempts to mobilize its member -states to either economic assistance or environmental protection schemes. Notably both types of intervention were tied to the promotion of novel scientific research, and especial ly international collaborative projects. The paper concludes that while eventually NATO opted for an environmental agenda, its 'greening' was actually a political restoration project rather than a true attempt to embrace environmentalism. 9 February Poorn ima Paidipaty (Faculty of History, Cambridge) 'The Grammar of the Semi -Exact Sciences': Norbert Wiener in India, 1955 -1956 From September 1955 until April 1956, the MIT mathematician and father of cybernetics, Norbert Wiener spent 7 months as a visiting p rofessor at the Indian Statistical Institute in Calcutta. According to his biographers Conway and Siegelman, his experiences in India had a profound influence on Wiener's later professional years. Yet little is known about this time period, which followed shortly on the success and acclaim of cybernetics, as a midcentury vision of techno- futurism. Between classroom lectures, Wiener spent much of his time working on a book manuscript, titled 'The Grammar of the Semi -Exact Sciences', on problems of nonlinear prediction. He promised his publisher that the book would serve as a splashy follow -up to his 1948 publication, Cybernetics . Though he never completed or published the book, the manuscript offers an important glimpse of Wiener's work on predictive analysis , especially when set in the context of India's rapid and uncertain postcolonial economic development. 2 March Nayanika Mathur (University of Sussex) Disappearing big cats and multiplying man- eaters in the Indian Anthropocene Species extinction as well as increasing levels of human -animal conflict are now widely considered two indicators of anthropic climate change. In this paper, I ethnographically locate and study these two trends in the Indian Himalaya in the context of leopards and tigers in an attem pt to elaborate how climate change is experienced in a specific region of India. In the Himalaya there has been a reduction in the number of leopards and tigers over time and, at the same time, there is an ongoing perceived spike in attacks on humans by th em. I describe how these two aspects are ascribed to climate change (or what could be understood to be climate change) by a range of actors. These include officials, conservationists, journalists, wildlife biologists, hunters, and villagers in the Upper Hi malaya. Climate change discourse has been discussed as 'elitist and exclusive' (Beck 2012) and the absence of a wider acknowledgement of its imminence has been ascribed to a 'failure of the imagination' (Ghosh 2016). Political - psychological studies have ar gued the sheer enormity of the calamity that awaits us leads to 111 active denialism (see Runciman 2014) while other works have shown the agents that have worked towards manufacturing scepticism or misinformation (e.g. Conway and Oreskes 2012). In lieu of such an approach that bemoans the absences of a deeper environmental and climactic consciousness, I work through an ethnographic engagement with disappearing big cats and multiplying man -eaters to argue that there are, in fact, wide ranging non -elite discussio ns of climate change and life in the Anthropocene in the everyday. What is needed is a finer attunement to stories and narratives that do not fit either the official, scientific discourses on climate change or the mainstream conservationist/developmental a ccounts that seek to protect big cats. 9 March Shen Yubin (Georgetown University) The Anthropocene seen by the Anopheles: fighting malarial mosquitoes with chemicals in modern China, 1910s -1960s What could the human malaria -vector Anopheles mosquito tell us about the Anthropocene in China? This paper intends to approach the Anthropocene in China by examining the origin, development and aftermath of malarial mosquito controls with chemical pesticides from the 1910s to 1960s. With the spread of germ theory and medical entomology from the West in the 1910s, mosquitoes were transformed from annoying but insignificant blood suckers to dangerous and must -be eliminated disease -carriers. Certain western chemical pesticides were also imported to supplement traditio nal Chinese measures and organic insecticides. In the Nanjing decade (1928-1937) and the wartime period (1937- 1945), several major chemical pesticides were experimented with in government -led campaigns against Anopheles mosquitoes and malaria as part of st ate medicine and national defense. But it was only after 1945, with the introduction of effective DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), that chemical pesticides began to dominate in mosquito controls. These chemicals were widely used in health campaigns i n PR China during the 1950s and 1960s. I will argue the massive usage of chemical pesticides is a useful indicator of the coming of the Anthropocene in China: it not only drastically reduced the distribution and population density of the Anopheles, but als o released toxic substances into the environment: for example, DDT residues can still be found in fishes in certain locations. In short, this paper supports the view that the Anthropocene in China began about 1950. Coffee with Scientists The aim of this group is to explore and enhance the interface between HPS and science. Though many of us in HPS engage closely with science and scientists, we could benefit from more explicit discussions about the relationship between HPS and science itself, and from more opportunities for HPS -scholars and scientists to help each other's work. We meet fortnightly on Fridays, 3.30-5.00pm in Seminar Room 2. Further information and reading materials will be distributed through the email list of the group; please contact Marta Halina (mh801) if you would like to be included on the list. 27 January Tom McLeish (Professor of Physics, Durham University) Extracting new science from 13th century treatises by Robert Grosseteste 112 10 February Simon Conway Morris (Professor of Palaeobiology, Department of Earth Sciences) Adrian Currie (Research Associate, CSER) Animal cognition 24 February Daniel De Haan (Postdoctoral Fellow in Theology, Philosophy of Religion, and Neuroscience, Faculty of Divinity) Philosophy and neuroscience 10 March Karoliina Pulkkinen (PhD Student, Department of History and Philosophy of Science) Beth Singler (Research Associate, Faraday Institute for Science and Religion) HPS and documentary filmmaking Cabinet of Natural History This research seminar is concerned with all aspects of the history of natural history and the field and environmental sciences. The regular programme of papers and discussions takes place over lunch on Mondays. In addition, the Cabinet organises a beginning -of-year fungus hunt and occasional expeditions to sites of historical and natural historical interest, and holds an end- of- year garden party. Seminars are held on Mondays at 1pm in Seminar Room 1 . You are welcome to bring your lunch with you. Organised by Edwin Rose (edr24). 23 January Katrina Maydom (HPS, Cambridge) Piety, diligence and learning: knowledge of American naturalia in Abraham Hill's commonplace books How was knowledge of American flora constructed in early modern England? Influenced by a commitment to benefit the commonwealth and better understand God's creation, Abraham Hill (1633-1721) drew on classical and contemporary writers and reported experienc e to develop his knowledge of materia medica new to England. As a merchant, founding Fellow of the Royal Society and a Commissioner of the Board of Trade and Plantations, Hill occupied a unique position to draw on extant and commissioned sources of informa tion about naturalia from the English colonies. By examining his ten volumes of little -studied commonplace books, we can gain significant insights into how he investigated nature and negotiated different authorities' knowledge claims to understand the properties of 'new world' plants. 30 January Sara Peres (HPS, Cambridge) Preparing for doomsday: vulnerability and the contemporary history of genebanking, 1970-2008 113 In January 2008, the first shipments of samples of agricultural seeds were deposited within the reinforced concrete walls of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, in the Arctic island of Spitsbergen. This iconic repository, sometimes dubbed the 'Doomsday Vault', has a particularly interesting function as a 'safety back -up' for other existing genebank c ollections. Its existence therefore shows that, despite the ideas of security implicit in the 'bank' metaphor, the loss of genebanks, and of material within them, are substantial concerns of plant conservationists and policy - makers. In this talk, I explor e the contemporary history of genebanking by investigating how actors conceptualized the susceptibility of genebanks to catastrophes great and small, from conflict to lack of funding, along with proposed solutions to these risks through 'safety duplication ', culminating in the establishment of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. Concerns with the appropriate way to ensure the security of genebanks and their materials figure prominently in international policy discussions about how to organize and fund conservat ion, and I argue that they are important in shaping the contemporary 'global system' . The contrast between the potential vulnerability of genebanks and their remit of securing diversity makes evident that maintaining collections for the long -term involves technical, infrastructural and social challenges, and that their continued existence cannot be taken for granted. Thus, this account shows the value in being attentive to the role of concerns about vulnerability in shaping the evolution of genebanking as actors seek to ensure their continued existence. 6 February Edwin Rose (HPS, Cambridge) The Endeavour journal and the natural historical working practices of Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, 1768-1771 This paper examines the Endeavour journal of Joseph B anks (1743- 1820) and how this manuscript diary, essentially a record of the day -to-day events which occurred during this voyage, is connected to Banks's and Daniel Solander's (1733 -82) natural historical work. Throughout this diary, Banks frequently mentio ns the new species he and Solander collected and consistently refers to the printed works in the Endeavour library, showing the interconnectedness between different aspects of their collection. These printed works included their interleaved copies of Carl Linnaeus's Species Plantarum (1763) and Systema Naturae (1758), which voyage progressed by Hermann Sp\u00f6ring (1733 -71), Solander's assistant. Banks and Solander's work during the Endeavour voyage sheds light on the emergence of professi onal fieldwork during the late eighteenth century and the gradual standardisation of natural historical working practices under the Linnaean system, which received an uneven reception by British naturalists at this time. 13 February Richard Bellis (University of Leeds) Pathology and preparations at the Great Windmill Street School Whilst William Hunter's vast collection of anatomical and pathological preparations has long been the subject of historical interest, how that collection was formed and u sed in the everyday work of the school has been understudied. The result is that historians have typically seen Hunter's series of lectures as being consistent in format and content across his career, and have drawn conclusions on his anatomical lectures b ased on this. However, a comparison of his early and late career lecture series reveals a substantial expansion in the content of the lectures. I argue 114 that this was the direct result of the continued collecting of preparations, with both the making of pre parations and the finished objects themselves acting as flexible tools for teaching and research at the school. Furthermore, as the overall collection grew, so did the opportunity to study pathology. The retaining of diseased parts from dissections and pos t-mortem examinations over the course of Hunter's career, alongside his assistants' collecting, allowed a range of morbid appearances to be seen and studied by them, as well as their students. This manifested itself in two ways: lectures on disease became a distinct part of Hunter's anatomical course, and Matthew Baillie's Morbid Anatomy (1793) utilised the collection to draw conclusions on changes in anatomical structure brought about by disease. I argue that the content of both the lectures and work by Ba illie, both distinct outputs of the school, was the result of the regular practice of the school: that of making preparations. 20 February Ben Bradley (Charles Sturt University, NSW) Natural history or psychology? Reading expressions and being read in Dar win's science of interdependence Charles Darwin claimed to have been the first to approach 'the highest psychical faculties of man ... exclusively from the side of natural history'. It was on grounds of his practice as a naturalist that Darwin distanced h is own studies of agency from those of contemporaries who overtly styled their work as 'psychology' (Spencer, Bain). What hung on this distinction? And what was it Darwin took from studying the economy of nature that he believed to illuminate mind and behaviour? Setting out from his crucial concept of 'social animals', I aim to show that natural history meant something more and other to Darwin than evolutionary ancestry, particularly when studying human agency: namely, the here -and-now of interdependence. M y case -study is of Darwin's methods for understanding the meanings of non- verbal expressions as residing in their recognition by others . His theory of blushing takes this form of recognition to a second level (I read you as reading me). This dynamic of hig her-order or 'meta' recognition proves to be the central principle in Darwin's explanations for the pangs of conscience and for erotic attraction. 27 February Boris Jardine (HPS, Cambridge) Natural history and the antiquarian The second half of the nineteenth century saw the rise of the 'New Museum Idea', a widespread increase in mass -audience museums containing both large research departments and extensive public galleries. The idea was given brick -and-mortar form in Cambridge on the 'New Museums Site' - the present home of HPS and former home of a suite of museums ranging across the sciences. In seeking to understand the development of these museums, and the revolution in university education to which they were tied, it is necessary to look at (at l east) three things: the nature of their collections, the professional identity of their curators, and the intellectual agenda that united them. In this talk I explore the role of antiquarianism and local history in the shaping of collections of natural spe cimens. Antiquarianism, I argue, acted at once as a filter through which ever -growing collections could be passed and interpreted, and a robust social identity that could justify and even mask the radical nature of the new museums. 6 March Charlie Jarvis (Natural History Museum) James Cuninghame - 'a learned and most industrious promoter of natural philosophy' 115 By any standards, James Cuninghame FRS (ca. 1665 -1709) led a remarkable life. A Scot trained in medicine in Leiden, he participated in four voyages bound for Asia, as a surgeon or trader, and discussed his discoveries with major figures of the time in natural philosophy in London, notably Hans Sloane, James Petiver, Leonard Plukenet and John Woodward. He narrowly escaped death in attacks on East Indi a Company (EIC) factories in Pulo Condore (Vietnam) and Banjarmassin (Borneo), and was imprisoned in France, the Canary Islands and Cochinchina, but he never failed to be an enthusiastic and conscientious collector, acquiring specimens of both natural and artificial objects (including hundreds of pressed plants, insects and shells, and watercolours of plants by native artists), as well as items of trade interest (tea samples, china clay, a scarlet dye, maps, a Chinese compass), wherever he touched land. Alt hough probably best known as one of the first people to bring extensive natural history collections from China (chiefly from Amoy (Xiamen) and Chusan (Zhoushan)) to Europe, Cuninghame also made collections in the Canary Islands, Ascension, St Helena, the C ape of Good Hope, Java, Malacca, Pulo Condore and Cochinchina, all of which are among the earliest that survive from many of these locations. New research is shedding light on the contexts in which Cuninghame travelled. His Amoy voyage, for example, is now known to have to have taken place on an interloping ship rather than one belonging to the EIC - remarkable in the context of trade with China at this time. 13 March James Poskett (HPS, Cambridge) Reading colonial photography: the publication and reception of A Phrenologist Amongst the Todas (1873) This talk follows phrenological photographs as they travelled back and forth across the imperial world. As a case study, I take the series of photographs featured in William Elliot Marshall's A Phrenologist Amo ngst the Todas (1873). The nineteen photographs in this book were originally taken in the Nilgiri Hills, in southern India. Together, the photographs and text document the phrenology of the Todas, a pastoral hill tribe living in the Nilgiris. Marshall's bo ok circulated widely. It was read by many of the most influential evolutionary and anthropological thinkers of the late nineteenth century including Charles Darwin, E.B. Tylor, Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages and W.H.R. Rivers. To date, historians have tr eated photography in India as relatively disconnected from the wider world. But as I argue in this talk, the history of photography in India needs to be understood, like the history of colonial photography more generally, as part of a global history of mat erial exchange. It was through circulation and reception that photography and phrenology became intertwined with evolutionary thought and colonial power.

Scholarly Practice, Style and the Dig ital What has the arrival of digital and network technologies done to styles of scholarship? This question has been asked of scientific practice by historians of science - by Jon Agar, Bruno Strasser and others. But technological change affects historians just as much as it does scientists, and so we wish to extend the analysis to our own practice. Using the concept of research 'style', we will discuss texts that reflect on scholarly practice, that deal with the arrival and development of digital and networ ked technologies, and that combine the two. To give structure to the year's reading we will follow the life -cycle of a piece of scholarly work, looking at Research in Michaelmas, Production/Authorship in Lent, and Audience/Users in Easter.

There is tea beforehand from 3pm in Seminar Room 1. Organised by Mary Brazelton and Marta Halina. 4 May Heather Douglas (University of Waterloo) The materials for trust -building in expertise The need for expertise is undisputed in today's complex society, but what expertise is, how to identify it, and how to build trust in it is hotly contested. Some philosophers presume that experts should be trusted and provide cursory means of assessment. Other philosophers argue that only experts can identify other experts, and thus we can do nothing but trust experts and hope for the best. Still other philos ophers rightly point out that experts have failed some groups of people (and been part of past injustices), so trust is something that must be earned. This debate takes place against a backdrop of an increasing rejection of expertise in Western democracies , and thus addressing these issues takes on some urgency. In this talk, I will argue that expertise consists of a fluency of judgement in a complex terrain. While such fluency cannot be transferred to non- experts quickly or easily (we cannot all become exp erts in everything), expertise can and should be assessed by non- experts. I will articulate plausible bases for assessment experts by non -experts, and argue that crucial trust -building materials are to be found among them. 11 May Twenty -Second Annual Hans Rausing Lecture Lissa Roberts (University of Twente) The history of failure: a chronicle of losers or key to success? McCrum Lecture Theatre, Bene't Street, at 4.30pm 18 May Henry Cowles (Yale University) Scientific habits circa 1900 In the decades around 1900, habits were scientific. Psychologists saw mental habits as the intersection of an evolutionary past and an experimental future, while neurologists thought that habit s ignaled the mind's bodily roots. This talk explores the consequences of this attention to habit in the emerging human sciences, including the idea that science itself was (or could be) habitual. The sciences of habit helped recast the scope of scientific t hinking and the reach of moral judgement, as issues of choice, willpower and belonging were naturalized in new ways. 25 May Lydia Patton (Virginia Tech) Frogs in space: physiological research into metric relationships and laws of nature A surprising amount of research into theories of space and time in the nineteenth century 124 involved experiments done on frogs' reactions to stimuli. William James and Hugo Munsterberg performed classic such experiments, but there was a much broader group involved. Those who cited the research and used it in their discussions of spatial relationships, and of the relationship between physiological and metric space, include Henri Poincar\u00e9 and Ernst Mach. Hermann von Helmholtz used experiments on frogs to establish a number of his most important results, including the claim that sensations are not propagated instantaneously but take time to propagate along a nerve. Helmholtz used other experiments on frogs to argue against the existence of a vital force, a key element of his proof of the conservation of force (energy), and a turning point in nineteenth- century physiology and medicine. Frogs mediated between the physiological and the metric: in theories of space and movement, and in theories of metabolism, energy and sensation. The formulation of well -known scientific laws during this time sprang from physiological as well as physical reasoning, and the domain of application of those laws extended to living bodies as well as to inert physical masses. Philosophers who argued that spatiotemporal relationships are fundamental to all sciences, like Cassirer and arguably Poincar\u00e9, were drawing on this history in part. The history of amphibious research forms part of the background to accounts of scientific law, like Wigner's and Mach' s, that draw on evolution, perception and consciousness, including Wigner's controversial argument that consciousness collapses the wave function. Twentieth Century Think Tank The Twentieth Century Think Tank offers broad coverage of 20th- and 21st -centu ry topics in the history, philosophy and sociology of science, technology and medicine. The regular programme of papers and discussions takes place on Thursdays over lunch. Think Tank meetings are held on Thursdays, 1 -2pm in Seminar Room 2 . All welcome! Organised by Richard Staley, Mary Brazelton, Helen Curry and Susanne Schmidt. 4 May Lena Springer (Needham Research Institute) Shifting formats, changing priorities in the modern Chinese materia medica genre: from Zhao Yuhuang's single items to drugs in acupuncture channels Materia medica are a written genre which has a long cultural history in Chinese. It has continuously integrated vernacular names for medicinal materials and drugs from orally transmitted practice. Furthermore, in the twentieth centur y, a fundamental shift occurred in modern science when 'old' and 'new' studies were combined in China to list single items of materia medica as an esteemed contribution to world science. Journal articles and early reference works serve as material in Lena Springer's talk to demonstrate how broad the range of options for selected content in the scientific entries was during the Republican period until the 1930s. A second change took place when the craze for particularly Chinese medicine drugs in the 1950s added another layer to the political claims and meanings attached to the materia medica entries: now scientists and historians regarded the well -tried Chinese drugs as a promising model for world revolution. As a model for ethnic development anywhere, the pr eviously disregarded Chinese theory, of acupuncture channels for instance, returned into the scientific literature. 125 11 May Ruth Wainman (University of Kent) Listening to scientists' stories: using the British Library's 'An Oral History of British Scienc e' archive The British Library's 'An Oral History of British Science' (OHBS) was created in 2009 to address the dearth of oral history archives dedicated to capturing the personal experiences of British scientists. This paper examines the implications of using an oral history archive to write about scientists' identities during my doctoral research and for historians of science more generally. The advantages of using life history interviews from the archive to explore scientists' narratives are situated wi thin the longer historiographical trajectories of the 'history from below' approach of oral history and the 'great men' foundations of history of science. In addition, this article reflects on the process of using a recent oral history archive that has not only allowed for an almost unprecedented access into the personal and working lives of recent scientists but also afforded a greater insight into the creation and aims of the OHBS itself. Coffee With Scientists The aim of this group is to explore and enhance the interface between HPS and science. Though many of us in HPS engage closely with science and scientists, we could benefit from more explicit discussions about the relationship between HPS and science itself, and from more opportunities for HPS -scholars and scientists to help each other's work. We meet fortnightly on Fridays, 3.30-5.00pm in Seminar Room 2. Further information and reading materials will be distributed through the email list of the group; please contact Marta Halina (mh801) if you wou ld like to be included on the list. 5 May Fumiya Iida (University Lecturer in Mechatronics, Machine Intelligence Laboratory, Cambridge) Biologically inspired robotics 19 May Alison Gopnik (Professor of Psychology, University of California, Berkeley) Life history and learning Cabinet of Natural History 1 May Jennifer M. Rampling (Princeton University) When a stone is not a stone: doing alchemy with plants and animals The pseudo- Aristotelian Secret of Secrets was a popular source of alchemical knowledge in medieval Europe, with its mysterious reference to 'a stone that is not a stone' - a substance which was simultaneously animal, vegetable and mineral. Over the centuries, alchemists picked over this trope as they sought to explain how substances from the different kingdoms of nature 126 were able to interact. For instance, ingredients that were apparently incompatible on philosophical grounds - such as gold, eggshells and spirit of wine - might in practice combine to create interesting effects, and to raise alchemical hopes. This talk will trace some attempts to solve theoretical and practical problems in multi -species alchemy, such as how to induce minerals to 'grow' like plants, or how to dissolve gold in vegetab le solvents. Above all, how could alchemists persuade patrons to invest in such techniques? 8 May Mark Wormald (Pembroke College, Cambridge) Poetic electrons: Ted Hughes and the mayfly In 1981, the artist Leonard Baskin wrote to the poet Ted Hughes with a list of fifteen projected poems about insects that would feature in their next collaboration. It began with 'The Mayfly'. A poem with that title appeared in London Magazine in 1983, but was never collected. The central poem in Flowers and Insects (1986) which Baskin illustrated, 'Saint's Island', incorporates several phrases and insights first used in 'The Mayfly'. And in 1993 Hughes published 'The Mayfly is Frail', in a revised text of his collection River (first published in 1983). This paper describes Hughes's education in the mayfly. Like its subject, it had a long and hidden larval stage, but took memorable flight in a fishing trip to Ireland in May 1982, which ended at Saint's Isla nd on Lough Ree. Two remarkable prose accounts of this trip are among Hughes' papers in the British Library. Between them they shape a visionary narrative, beginning with an Oxford tutorial in entomology from his son Nicholas, and detailing Hughes's attemp ts, in the company of a group of fanatical Irish fishermen, to catch lough trout on imitations of its dun, or Green Drake, and spinner, or Spent. The poetry that emerged from this experience is faithful to these circumstances but also transcends them, offe ring a powerful vision of ecological interconnection not just to lovers of poetry but to all those concerned for the health of our rivers and lakes. 15 May Christina Skott (History, Cambridge) Clas Fredrik Hornstedt, the 'last Linnaean' East Indies , 1783-4 In the early 1780s members of the circle of amateur naturalists in Batavia sometimes referred to as the 'East -Indies Enlightenment' sought to appoint a curator for the collections of the newly founded Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetens chappen . It was not far -fetched to turn to Sweden, as the society looked for a naturalist trained in Linnaean method and nomenclature. The man eventually sent out to Java was Clas Fredrik Hornstedt, a student of Carl Peter Thunberg, himself one of the most prominent students of Linnaeus. Hornstedt would spend little over a year in Java. Returning to Sweden in 1786 he brought with him vast collections, not only of animals, plants and minerals, but also materia medica , ethnographica and manuscripts, as well a s extensive journals and annotations. This paper uses Hornstedt's collecting endeavour in the East -Indies to make observations on the status of science in Sweden in the generation after the death of Linnaeus. It is argued that the Linnaean ambition to rec ord and list everything with boundless scientific detail here was extended to geography, history, literature, thus contributing to the empirical knowledge of eighteenth -century Java and its inhabitants. But Hornstedt has also been seen as the last travelli ng Linnaean, and the fate of his collections shows that this particular form of knowledge 127 gathering and collecting was increasingly becoming unfashionable in Sweden. 22 May Ken McNamara (Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge) Exploring John Woodward's scientific writing in his catalogues of fossils (1728, 1729) The 9,600 specimens that form the geological collection of Dr John Woodward (1667 -1728) were, in part, bequeathed to the University of Cambridge. Of the four cabinets that housed his collection, the two no t bequeathed were purchased by the University from Woodward's executors, thus keeping the collection intact. Woodward was meticulous in detailing the provenance of his specimens, whether collected by himself or donated by others. This he did in a number of hand- written catalogues which are housed today in the Sedgwick Museum's archives. These catalogues, subsequently published in two volumes after Woodward's death, are not merely lists of specimens. They contain many of Woodward's ideas on geology, mineralo gy and palaeontology. Although he is best remembered for his contentious An Essay toward a Natural History of the Earth:... published in 1695, the catalogues contain a wealth of observations and interpretations of the geological world by Woodward that were , in many cases, hundreds of years ahead of their time. Along with a discussion of his classification of rocks and minerals, and hierarchical classification of fossilised organic remains, I will examine a number of his insightful interpretations based on h is collection, especially in palaeoecology and taphonomy, showing that Woodward deserves to be credited with being one of the first scientific geologists. 30 May Cabinet Trip to the Natural History Museum, London We will be visiting a selection of histor ical collections in the Botany Department, Earth Sciences Department, Entomology Department and the Library and Archives. Due to the size of the rooms in the Museum, only a maximum of 20 participants can be accommodated. More details will follow shortly. 5 June James Delbourgo (Rutgers University) Ten things you always wanted to know about Hans Sloane, founder of the British Museum... but were afraid to ask In 1759 the British Museum opened its doors for the first time - the first free national public museum in the world. But how did it come into being? This talk is based on a new biography of its founder, Hans Sloane, which recounts the story behind the museum's creation. Born in Northern Ireland in 1660, Sloane amassed a fortune as a London society physi cian, becoming a member of the Whig establishment and president of the Royal Society and Royal College of Physicians. His wealth and contacts enabled him to assemble an encyclopedic collection of specimens and objects - the most famous cabinet of curiositi es of its time. For Sloane, collecting a world of objects meant collecting a world of people. His marriage to a Jamaican sugar heiress gave him access to both planters and African slaves, from whom he collected a variety of objects. He then established a n etwork of agents to supply artifacts from China, India, North America, the Caribbean and beyond: plants and animals, books and manuscripts, a 'shoe made of human skin', the head of an Arctic walrus, slaves' banjos, magical amulets, Buddhist shrines, copies of the Qur'n and more - nothing was off limits to Sloane's curiosity and fortune. The overlooked story of one of the Enlightenment's most controversial luminaries offers a fresh perspective on the entanglement of scientific discovery and imperialism in t he eighteenth century 128 and the heritage of today's global museums. 16 June Cabinet Garden Party, Finella, Queen's Road Sujit Sivasundaram (History, Cambridge) The oils of Empire and the banks of the Irrawaddy CamPoS 3 May Tushar Menon (University of Oxford) Affine balance: algebraic spacetime functionalism as a guide to identifying spacetime 10 May Catherine Kendig (Michigan State University) How can we homologize holobionts, and whose lineage matters? 17 May Alison Gopnik (University of California, Berkeley) The Theory Theory 2.0: Bayesian models, causal inference and cognitive development 24 May Lydia Patton (Virginia Tech) Listening to the chirps: how do the LIGO results test general relativity?
