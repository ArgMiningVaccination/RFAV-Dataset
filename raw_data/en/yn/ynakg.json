The Miller School plans to enroll 1,000 volunteers in South Florida in that clinical trial, expected to begin this summer. Prospective study volunteers will need to be 18 or older and can register to participate through an [online registry](https://www.coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org/). Using community outreach and mobile operations, Miller School clinical researchers plan to recruit young and older adults, including groups with existing co-morbidities. \"We are committed to engaging people who represent the range of residents impacted by COVID-19 in South Florida by gender, age, race, and ethnicity, as well as those who are particularly at risk because of medical conditions,\" said Dr. Doblecki-Lewis. \"This is how we will help ensure that any vaccine that is developed will be relevant for those who could benefit most from it.\" The Miller School of Medicine is a major research center for infectious diseases, particularly HIV and AIDS. The University's affiliation with the HIV Vaccine Trials Network made it a natural location to test COVID-19 vaccines. The new NIH-led COVID-19 Prevention Trials Network, which is spearheading the nation's vaccine efforts, was established by merging four existing NIAID-funded clinical trials networks: the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), based in Seattle; the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN), based in Durham, N.C.; the Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Consortium (IDCRC), based in Atlanta; and the AIDS Clinical Trials Group, based in Los Angeles.
