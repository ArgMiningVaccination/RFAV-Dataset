Our staff is working daily with the RI Department of Health (DOH), providing continuous information about participants in our program. We have been advocating for those we serve and while th e first tier of vaccinations is still underway, DOH Director Dr Alexander - Scott has stated that some tiers may overlap depending on vaccine volume. We believe that all at -risk individuals, providers, and staff should be vaccinated and we have strongly an d repeatedly advocated for that - however it is a challenge with a very limited supply of vaccine at this time. We expect that as more pharmaceutical firms get their vaccines approved, the timetable will become more generous. As soon as vaccinations dates become available, we will make information available. COVID Vaccination Dr. Philip Chan, one of the infectious diseases physicians and medical directors at the Rhode Island Department of Health , provide d an update on RI's vaccination progress thus far. This has been a challenging year filled with frustration and loss for so many of us, including me. I know first -hand how strenuous it's been on our frontline healthcare providers, who are working around the clock to keep Rhode Islanders safe and healthy. But as we look toward 2021, I am filled with optimism that our vaccination efforts will turn things around. We are currently using two COVID -19 vaccines in Rhode Island: one made by Pfizer and one made by M oderna. After weeks of scrutiny \u2014 extensive clinical trials with tens of thousands of participants followed by teams of FDA scientists examining the vaccine's effectiveness, safety, potential side effects, and manufacturing process and an independent revie w by Rhode Island's COVID -19 Vaccine Subcommittee \u2014 we've found that both vaccines are safe. Both are enormously effective (~95%). This is a huge step forward in the fight against COVID -19! Because we began planning for this months ago, our vaccination cam paign hit the ground running. Rhode Island currently has one of the best state -level immunization programs in the country. We've vaccinated nearly 13,000 people already and have 14,000 doses of the two vaccines coming into Rhode Island each week. We starte d off vaccinating high -risk workers in hospitals, and this week started vaccinating residents and staff in nursing homes. We're planning to administer initial doses of the vaccine at all nursing homes by mid -January. This week, we also started clinics for home health and hospice workers, EMS personnel, and first responders. The Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities & Hospitals 2 DD News 1/8/2021 WEB: -3014 Once we've protected our healthcare workers, we're going to move to additional populations who work or live in higher -risk settings. We have a major focus on equity. That means not on ly making sure that the communities and sectors hardest hit have access to vaccine first but also making sure that every person in every neighborhood in Rhode Island has access to a vaccine. Transportation issues or lack of health insurance will not be bar riers for anyone. The vaccine will be available to all Rhode Islanders regardless of insurance status, and no one will have to pay out of pocket. As the vaccine becomes more available in the coming weeks, we will continue to provide regular updates about who can get vaccinated and where. We plan to make vaccines as accessible as possible at local doctor's offices, pharmacies, community clinics, and more. But we are all going to need to be patient. Rhode Islanders will be vaccinated over the course of mont hs, not weeks. The pandemic has truly been a marathon, and while we've come so far already, we still have a little ways to go. Marathons are the toughest right before the end, but soon the finish line will be in sight. Between now and then, we need to sta y focused - wear masks, practice physical distancing - in addition to getting vaccinated when it's our turn. So thank you, everyone, for your patience and diligence during this time. We are getting through this together!

Because people with disabilities are especially proficient at living in a world not built for them, they are often experts at n egotiating technologies to seek their own flourishing. The events, organized by The Hastings Center and supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, feature a range of scholars, artists, writers, and thought leaders with disabilities engaging in conversations about how they use \u2014 and why they may refuse \u2014 technology in their work and lives. The events are free and open to the public, and they are accessible to people with disabilities. Event 1. Belong ing: On Disability, Technology, and Community Exploring how people with disabilities are using \u2014or resisting \u2014 technologies to promote their own flourishing. Event 2. Navigating: On Disability, Technology, and Experiencing the World The purpose of this series is to explore the theme that people can flourish in all sorts of bodies. To flourish, on our understanding means to exercise the capacities we were born with in pursuit of the goals we find meaningful. None of us needs a differe nt body to flourish, we need different, more supportive environments. Event 3. Disrupting Ableism with Artful Activism What will it take to bring about lasting justice for disabled people in the United States? When will every body \u2014and every voice \u2014be indispensable? Poets and activists Lateef McLeod and D.J. Savarese imagine a society led by people with disabilities and show how disabled communities are already building this world through creative forms of resist ance.
