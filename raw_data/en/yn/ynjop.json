These symbols act as tangible, material links to spiritual powers. Rootworkers and conjure doctors typically use the seals in their rituals to summon powerful energy. Magical seals are available in many different images. Each icon represents a specific desire, goal, or trait that corresponds with your needs. Seals incorporate sigils and symbols, including astrological information, the names of angels and demons, and Latin or Hebrew inscriptions into their artwork. These symbols can be used to make talismans which are worn or carried to avert harm, ward off misfortune, protect against danger, to bring good, insure fortunate events and attract love, luck, and favorable conditions. To incorporate a magical seal into your ritual, begin by addressing the spiritual power you are calling upon for help. Decide which seal best suits your needs. Some examples might be the \"Seal of the Golden Candlestick\", \"Seal of Jupiter\" or \"Seal of Aziabelis\". Once you have chosen your seal, draw a triangle on the paper, around the seal. In ceremonial magic, the triangle is used to constrain the spirit. In this spell, it is used to focus the spiritual power upon your petition, which you write on the sides of the triangle. The next part of the petition is announcing your request. Aziabelis is called upon to attract friendship. If you were petitioning this particular seal, on the sides of the triangle you might write something along the lines of: \"Aziabelis, help me to meet new people and make friends quickly.\" Anoint the paper with a magical oil that corresponds with your goal. Place the paper with the triangle and seal underneath the candle and light the candle. The spell is cast when the candle burns out. Once the spell is cast, the paper can be left on your altar or placed near what is supposed to affect. If the spell is for another person, give it to them to keep if at all possible. If your spell is for an ongoing condition or power, such as prosperity or astral projection, you should re-charge it monthly. To do this, simply burn a candle again.
