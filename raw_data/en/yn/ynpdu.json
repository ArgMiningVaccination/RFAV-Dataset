This resulted from heightened health awareness brought on by the COVID-19 epidemic. There is a dearth of appropriate health psychology perspectives in the existing study examining the effect of COVID-19 on consumers' use of crowdsourced logistics (CL) platforms. In order to provide unique and thorough insights into how consumer health concerns can affect consumers' subjective views and their decisions to use CL, this study combines the health belief model and the technology acceptance model. Design/methodology/approach Five hundred valid responses from an online survey that was created and administered in Singapore were analysed using structural equation modelling. Findings The findings show that all of the suggested constructs have a favourable influence on consumers' intentions to use CL. The suggested model also demonstrates high explanatory power, with perceived usefulness serving as the primary driver, followed by perceived ease of use and self-efficacy. Originality/value The study advances previous academic research on CL and offers guidance to CL companies and lawmakers for promoting sustainable and secured last-mile delivery.
