Ambassador Qin spoke with Kim Mont - gomery,DirectorofInternationalAffairs andScienceDiplomacyandExecutiveEd - itorof Science&Diplomacy,onChina's science diplomacy initiatives. Here is thefull text of the interview. Kim Montgomery :Since China and the United States established diplo - matic relations in 1979, the U.S.-China Agreement on Cooperation in Science and Technology, renewed every year since, has led to robust collaboration in science and technology. You arrived in Washington,DCasAmbassadoratapiv - otal time, given the tensions between the countries. What are China's priori - ties for the bilateral relationship and what role do you see for science, tech - nology,andinnovation? Ambassador Qin: Since the estab - lishment of diplomatic ties more than forty years ago, China- U.S. relations have made historic progress, despite sometwistsandturnsandthemanydif - ferences in our social systems, histories, cultures, and approaches to develop - ment. We are ready to work with the United States to respect each other, peacefully coexist, and pursue coopera - tion. Scientific and technological ex - changesandcooperationhaveplayedan important role in the development of China-U.S. relations and are still an im - portantpartofourbilateralrelationship. Evenbeforeweofficiallyestablisheddip - lomatic relations, U.S. President Carter's scienceadvisorvisitedChina.In 1979,af- diplomatic relations were estab - lished,Mr.DengXiaopingandPresidentCarter signed the China-U.S. Agreement onCooperationinScienceandTechnolo - gy, the first formal cooperation agree - ment between the two governments. Overthepastfortyyears,morethanthir - ty protocols and agreements in a wide range of areas including health, climate change,ecologicalprotection,andnucle - ar safety have been signed under the frameworkoftheAgreement. When China and the United States worktogethertoaddressglobalissuesas the ones I just mentioned, and jointly manage the uncertainties of emerging technologies,wecandelivergreaterben - efits to our two peoples and better pre - pare humanity for an uncertain future. Limitationsonthatcollaboration,includ - ing restrictions on Chinese scientists and students, are in the interest of nei - therside. Montgomery: You have more than thirty years of diplomatic experience, having served as Vice Minister of For - eign Affairs, Director-General of Proto - col,andmultiplepostsrelatedtoEurope - an affairs, among other positions. What rolehasscience,technology,andinnova - tionplayedinyourdiplomaticcareer? Ambassador Qin: Throughout my diplomatic career, exchanges and coop - eration in science and technology have beenanimportantpartofstate-to-state relations, in line with President Xi's vi - sion of building a community with a sharedfutureformankind. When I was posted in the UK, alongwithlearningwhythefirstIndus - trial Revolution took place there and how the country had produced re - nownedscientistsfromIsaacNewtonto Michael Faraday, I worked hard to pro - mote scientific and technological coop -eration between China and the UK. Un - der the framework of the UK-China Re - search and Innovation Partnership Fund (the UK's Newton Fund), China and the UK have jointly funded more than two hundredChineseandBritishresearchin - stitutionstocarryouthundredsofcoop - erativeprojects. Montgomery: One key aspect of sciencediplomacyistheuseofscientific knowledge and expertise to inform dip - lomatic objectives. China has a rich his - tory with centuries of integrating sci - ence into its foreign relations. How is science integrated into China's present- daydiplomaticactivities?Howisthatin - fluencedbyhistoricalendeavors? Ambassador Qin: With tion more than 5,000years old, China hasproducedworld-renownedscientific and technological achievements, includ - ingthefourgreatinventionsofgunpow - der, paper making, printing, and the compass. Traditional Chinese culture values harmony, with evidence easily found in the science of ancient China. For instance, Mozi, an eminent scholar oftheSpringandAutumnPeriod( 770- 476BC),denouncedunjustwarsandad - vocated for \"universal love,\" while also researching techniques for the defense of cities. With a tabletop simulation of those techniques, he was able to per - suadethekingofChu(astate)nottoat - tackSong(anotherstate). ThegoalofChina'sdiplomacytoday istoworktowardsworldpeaceandpro - mote global development. We value the role of science and technology in diplo - macy.Forexample,Chinaisreadytocar - ry out international space cooperation withothercountriesonthebasisofmutu - alrespect,openness,inclusiveness,equal -ity,andmutualbenefit.Wewillcontinue to intensify international cooperation in theexpansionofspacestationfunctions, space science and its applications, and thejointflightofChineseandforeignas - tronauts.WehaveinvitedallUnitedNa - tions member states to submit coopera - tive pilot projects to board the Chinese spacestationtoprovideanewmodelof international cooperation for future space explorations. So far, nine projects from seventeen countries have been se - lected, and we will soon announce the secondroundofopportunities. Montgomery: Fifty years ago, U.S. President Nixon's National Security Ad - visorHenryKissingermadeasecretvisit toBeijing,whichlaidthefoundationfor President Nixon's 1972visit to China. During that and subsequent trips, sci - ence was one of the areas noted for fu - ture cooperation. Earlier this year, you had the opportunity to meet with Dr. Kissinger. Did you discuss how science engagements can help improve relations between countries? Did he provide any insights on present and future U.S.- Chinarelations? Ambassador Qin: Dr.Kissingerisa senior statesman and strategic thinker. HeisalsoatrailblazerinChina-U.S.rela - tions,supportingtheirdevelopmentand making historic contributions. He is deeply respected by both the Chinese andtheAmericanpeople.

These ef - forts are instrumental in addressing global challenges such as climate change. Can you elaborate on China's diplomaticprioritiesinworkingwiththe UnitedStatesandtheinternationalcom - munity to find science-based solutions Confrontedwith the pandemic, China has shared infor - mation and experience and strength - ened international cooperation in the joint R&D for vaccines, treatments, and testing. China has provided more than 1.8billion doses of vaccines to more thanonehundredcountriesandinterna - tional organizations, and the total num - berofvaccinesweprovidefortheworld this year will reach two billion doses. China has partnered with thirty coun - tries in the Initiative for Belt and Road PartnershiponCOVID- 19VaccinesCoop - erationtopromotethefairinternational distribution of vaccines. We hope that China and the United States will strengthen their scientific and techno - logical cooperation to help the world overcomethepandemicassoonaspossi - ble. Climate change is a common chal - lenge to mankind, and all countries need to work together to address it. Asthe world's largest developing country, China has adopted a host of strategies andactionsonclimatedespiteeconomic and social difficulties. These efforts have paid off. President Xi Jinping re - cently announced that China is striving to reach peak CO 2emissions before 2030andcarbonneutralitybefore 2060. There is much room for China-U.S. cooperationregardingclimatechange.In both countries, fossil fuels account for more than80% of energy consumption. Both are also transitioning to renewable energy faster than any other countries in the world, and are looking for ad - vancements in clean energy technolo - gies. The U.S.-China Clean Energy Re - search Center (CERC), a typical example of bilateral research cooperation, has produced many mutually beneficial achievements in the past decade. The project has been suspended, but we hope to find a new model of coopera - tionregardingcleanenergy. Montgomery: In the past few de - cades, China has significantly increased its international scientific collabora - tions, including a focus on South-South collaborationwithS&TprogramsinAfri - ca, South Asia, and Latin America. How aretheseinternationalscientificengage - ments advancing China's diplomatic ob - jectives in general and in the Global Southspecifically? Ambassador Qin: South-Southco - operationisanessentialmeansforless- developed countries to help each other and develop together. China is always prepared to work with other developing countriesonscientificandtechnological exchanges. Iwouldliketohighlightthreemea - suresthatwehavecarriedout.First,we share with these countries mature and applicable technologies, putting them to local use to boost those countries' eco - nomicdevelopment.Second,wehavees - tablished joint laboratories with them, conducting joint research in agriculture, radio and television, clean energy, and more.Third,weholdtrainingclasseson applicabletechnologiesandcarryoutex - changes among young scientists.

OneexcitingexampleisChina'sco - operation with the Comoros, an island country in East Africa, to fight malaria. Moh\u00e9li, the Comoros' smallest island, had suffered from malaria for years. When the Comoros sought to cooperate withChinatofightthedisease,themed - ical professionals of our two countries agreed to use Artequick, a Chinese-de - veloped artemisinin-piperaquine tablet. Withinfiveyears( 2008-2013),theannu- al incidence of malaria in Moh\u00e9li dropped by95% and the death rate fell to zero. The research on using artemis - inin to fight malaria was initiated by a Chinese female scientist, Dr. Tu Youy - ou, in1969, who shared the 2015Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with twootherscientists. Montgomery: You served as the head of the information office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry. What advice wouldyougivetoscientistswhowantto communicate their research and find - ings more effectively to the diplomatic communityandthepublic? Ambassador Qin: We have much to learn from the popularization of sci - ence in the United States. For example, Science magazine, published by the AAAS,doesanoutstandingjob.Inaddi - tion to scientific research papers, each issueofthemagazineincludesshortsto - riesoncurrentaffairsregardingscientif - ic areas such as quantum mechanics, blackholes,andartificialintelligence. My impression is that when scien - tists communicate scientific information to the public, the difficulty of the con - cepts and complexity of the data create somebarriers.Forexample,itisdifficult for the public to understand the con - ceptsof1.5\u00b0Cand2\u00b0Cofglobalaverage temperature rise, as described in the Sixth Assessment Report of the IPCC. These abstract concepts should be illus -tratedthroughreal-lifescenarios.Forin - stance, scientists could explain that if the temperature rise exceeds 1.5\u00b0 C, some natural disasters which used to happen once in a century will likely oc - cur every year. This explanation will make the temperature rise easier to un - derstand and could help increase sup - portforaction. Montgomery: China is a vast and diversecountry.Whentravelismorefea - sible, what destination highlights would yourecommendpeopletoseewhenvis - itingChina,particularlyiftheyareinter - estedinscienceandtechnology? Ambassador Qin: China is a vast country, with immense geographic and culturaldiversityandtime-honoredhis - toricaltraditions. IfyouareinterestedintheChinese scientific achievements of the past, I would recommend the ancient observa - toryinBeijingandtheDujiangyanirriga - tion project in Chengdu, Sichuan Prov - ince. Dujiangyan was built in 272BC. I have been there myself, and have seen how it is able to control the river and use the floodwater for irrigation. It is amazingthatthe 2,000-year-oldproject isstillrunningtoday.Ifyouareinterest - ed in something modern, the \"Sky Eye\" (Five-Hundred-MeterApertureSpherical Radio Telescope, FAST, one of the larg - est in the world) in Guizhou, the Jiu - quan Satellite Launch Center in Inner Mongolia and the remote sensing satel - lite ground station in Hainan can give you a good idea of China's scientific achievementsincurrenttimes. Ofcourse,Iwouldalsorecommend metropolises such as Beijing, Shanghai, andShenzhen,whicharehometomany well-known universities, research insti - tutions,andhigh-techenterprises. As Chinese ambassador to the U.S., I warmly and sincerely welcome you and the American people to visit my country.

I appliedforthepositionandwassuccess - ful,movingtoChinainJanuary 2007. On the way over I started to get anxiousasIwasnotsurewhattoexpect when I arrived with just my passport andasuitcasefilledwithwinterclothes.

It was at that moment that IfellinlovewithChinaandfeltIshould havecomemuchearlierinmylife. During my first few years in China, from2007to2014, I worked as a con - struction engineer and project manager on the outskirts of Shanghai, Beijing, Yinchuan and Nanjing. Construction work takes place much faster here in China.Thelaborforceisincrediblylarge but there needs to be more checks and qualitycontrol. When the financial crisis began in 2014,IreturnedtoGermanyandworked in my old company office. There I no - ticed how different the construction work in Germany was. For example, Chineseprojectswerehandledby 20en- gineers, whereas in Germany we need 3 times more than that. So, it was not a surprise that I took the first good offer available to head back to China which I wasmissingsomuch.Fivemonthsafter returning to Germany, I got an offer from another German company in Bei - jingwithahigh-rankposition. I lived in Beijing from 2007until 2008and I loved the art scene there. I usually spent my Sunday afternoons, which was my only day off, walking around the hutongs (narrow alleyways in the old parts of the city), which was always a delight. I really love Chinese food, as the delicious tastes range from spicy to sweet and sour. Additionally, I love how nice and friendly the people are,evenifapersoncan'tcommunicate inGermanorEnglish,theyarewillingto listen,helpandbecomeyourfriends. At the end of 2016, I had to leave the construction company that I hadjoined in2014due to some internal is - sues.However,IdecidedtostayinShang - hai for an extra year developing an ice- machinetoproduceaspecialtypeofice.

Unfortunately, due to circumstanc - es beyond my control, I only started work on getting the correct business documents and licenses in 2018.
