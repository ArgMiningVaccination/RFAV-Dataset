Traditional Remedies for Holistic Well-being Herbal therapy is a very important part of Traditional Eastern medicine and what we do here at the White Crane Clinic. Herbs have been used for centuries to treat many different acute and chronic conditions. These herbs are used to help balance your body, strengthen your deficiencies, and help ward off illness and disease. Herbal medicine is used singularly or in conjunction with supplements and pharmaceuticals with the intention of treating the root cause and relieving the symptoms of the disease, pathogen or deficiency that is presenting. Similar to acupuncture, herbal medicine is used to treat anything you would see a primary care physician for. These include headaches, migraines, sinus issues, allergies, anxiety, depression, palpitations, sleep issues, digestive disorders, fertility issues, pain of any type, UTI, etc. Herbal medicine, often combined with supplements, include many different ingredients such as vitamins, minerals and enzymes in addition to the herbs. These combinations are essential to optimal health care in the body and can be prescribed through the physician's diagnosis including but not limited to, pulse, tongue and symptomology. Herbal medicine and supplements have less side effects than prescription medications and are used to help patients receive and absorb nutrients that their body needs. Because of this, herbal medicine is available and safe for children, pregnant women and patients currently taking pharmaceuticals as long as prescribed by a board-certified acupuncturist and herbalist.
