It has also been temporally associated with immunization, but has not been previously described following two different live attenuated vaccines. Case presentation: A case is presented of a 12 month old Caucasian boy with recurrent benign 6thnerve palsy following measles-mumps-rubella and varicella vaccines, given on separate occasions with complete recovery following each episode. No alternate underlying etiology was identified despite extensive investigations and review. Conclusions: The majority of benign 6th nerve palsies do not have a sinister cause and have an excellent prognosis, with recovery expected in most cases. The exact pathophysiology is unknown, although hypothesesincluding autoimmune mechanisms and direct viral invasion could explain the pathophysiology behindimmunization related nerve palsies. It is important to rule out other aetiologies with thorough history, physicalexamination and investigations. There is limited information in the literature regarding the safety of a repeat dose ofa live vaccine in this setting. Future immunizations should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Keywords: Pediatric, Immunization, 6 thnerve, Palsy, Vaccine Background The age and gender-adjusted incidence of sixth nerve palsy is 11.3 per 100,000, with 26% of cases with undeter- mined or benign aetiology [1]. Within the paediatric age group, acute benign sixth nerve palsy accounts for 9-14% of all sixth nerve palsies [2]. It is of presumed inflamma-tory etiology, and may and bacterial are rarer with pre- sumed similar etiology. Recurrence has been temporally associated with immunization [4], including both inacti- vated and live attenuated viral vaccines (Table 1). It hasnot previously been described following two different liveattenuated vaccines. A case of recurrent sixth nerve palsyfollowing different live attenuated vaccines is reported anddiscussed.Case presentation A previously healthy 12 month old boy presented to hos-pital with a right 6 thnerve palsy seven days after -Hepatitis B (ComvaxW,Merck). He had been well for the first four days post-immunization, butthen noted by his grandparents to have a \"squint \"and appear lethargic. He presented for medical attention onday seven post-vaccination because of persistent con-cerns about his unusual eye movements. Two months earlier he had received his second catch- up dose of 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine (MeningitecW,Wyeth Vaccines ). He had experienced no adverse events from any of his previ-ous vaccinations, which were up to date for his age on theroutine Australian National Immunization Program sched-ule [12]. He had a past history of emergency delivery at 36 weeks gestation by caesarean section for twin-twin transfusion following a twin pregnancy conceived by in- vitro fertilization. There were no significant neonatal pro- blems and he was developmentally age appropriate. * Correspondence: nigel.crawford@rch.org.au 2SAEFVIC, Murdoch Children 's Research Institute (MCRI), Melbourne, Australia 3Department of General Medicine, Royal Children's Hospital (RCH), Melbourne, Australia Full list of author information is available at the end of the article \u00a9 2012 Cheng et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

BMC Infectious Diseases 2012, 12:105 Page 2 of 5 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/12/105On admission he was afebrile, blood pressure 117/59, pulse rate 120/min, respiratory rate 30/min and oxygensaturation of 95%. There was no history of precedingviral illness or prodrome and no symptoms developedduring admission. Further evaluation by a pediatric neur- ologist and ophthalmologist confirmed an isolated right 6 thnerve palsy, with no evidence of facial asymmetry. There was mild plagiocephaly, with a head circumferenceof 46.5 cm (50 thcentile). No ptosis was evident, and fun- doscopic examination bilaterally was normal. Initial blood investigations included normal full blood examination (Hb 128 g/L; Platelets 284 x109/L; leuko- cytes 11.1 x function tests, creatinine kinase wasnormal (3 mm/hr). Neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography (MRA) of the brain demonstrated nointracranial abnormality. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exam-ination revealed no white cells, 89 red cells x10 6/L, protein of 0.19 g/L (0.20-0.40), glucose 2.8 mmol/L (2.8-4.0) and lactate of 1.2 mmol/L. A random blood glucose level was 6.0 mmol/l. There was no growth on CSF cultures. TheCSF opening pressure was 31 cm CSF, but this wasobtained at the third attempt at a lumbar puncture in ascreaming child, and the pressure was therefore likely arte-factually elevated. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies werenegative (0.2 nmol/L). The differential diagnoses with this presentation included a post viral 6 thnerve palsy, idiopathic cranial nerve palsy, myasthenia gravis and benign intracranial hypertension. He was initially trialed on Pyridostigmine(Mestinon WValeant) 5 mg three times daily. This was subsequently increased to 10 mg three times daily, butwith no change in clinical signs it was ceased. The 6 th nerve palsy persisted at one-week post vaccination, butcompletely resolved spontaneously over the next six weeks, with resolution confirmed on ophthalmology fol- low-up. The child then re-presented aged 20 months with a re- current episode of a right 6 thnerve palsy. On this occa- sion it commenced followed a different live virusvaccination -Varicella (Varivax WMerck ) given four weeks earlier. Again, there was no viral prodrome and he had otherwise been alert and well. He presented with identical symptoms of a squint and was brought to hos- pital for evaluation five weeks after immunization. Re-peat examination by an ophthalmologist and pediatric neurologist again confirmed an isolated 6 thnerve palsy with no evidence of papilledema. He was afebrile andhaemodynamically stable. The nerve palsy worsened overthe subsequent two days, then significantly improvedover the next 7 -10 days and had entirely resolved by 5 weeks, now a total of 9 weeks post immunisation. Onthis presentation, he did not have any neuro-imaging, CSF analysis or repeat blood investigations. Over the next 12 months the child tolerated numerous viral infections with no recurrence of the squint or any neurological symptoms. He had ongoing ophthalmology review with no abnormalities noted. A follow-up with pediatric neurology at two years of age confirmed a nor-mal examination, with all appropriate developmentalmilestones reached. Following detailed discussion with the family it was advised that further live attenuated vaccines not beadministered, even though the routine Australianimmunization schedule includes a MMR vaccine (2 nd dose) at 4 years of age [12]. The main reason for this ad-vice was that no previous recurrent cases had beenreported in the scientific literature and therefore thesafety of further live attenuated vaccines in this settingwas unknown. Discussion By definition, a benign 6thnerve palsy is not due to a sinister underlying cause, such as an underlying spaceoccupying lesion, and recovery is expected. The condi-tion has a female predominance and the left side is most commonly affected, in contrast to this case [13]. The condition is a known sequel of viral illnesses, infections and immunization [4]. The majority of palsiesdescribed as associated with immunization have involvedattenuated live vaccinations, including MMR and VZV (see Table 1) [13]. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of recurrent benign 6 thnerve palsy fol- lowing two different live attenuated vaccinations. Whilst an isolated 6thcranial nerve palsy may seem less likely to be due to an underlying sinister cause, up to athird of such palsies in children have a neoplastic origin[14]. Therefore, a thorough history and physical examin-ation is recommended, in combination with an MRI brainscan [15]. Fasting blood glucose, complete cell count,blood pressure evaluation, lumbar puncture and otherinvestigations may be warranted, but should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Further review by a neurologist and ophthalmologist is recommended to assess if add- itional symptoms or clinical signs arise over time. Despite a seemingly temporal association between benign 6 thnerve palsy and immunization in children, the patho- physiological mechanism and exac t site of cellular injury remains unclear. Hypotheses include damage from auto-immune mediation or direct viral invasion causing demye- lination, localized arteritis or genetic predisposition, which could increase susceptibility to such nerve palsies [5,16]. The hypothesis that it could relate to additives in the vaccine is unlikely. Neomycin is used as a preservative toprevent bacterial contamination in both the MMR andvaricella vaccines, but has only been shown to contributeCheng et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2012, 12:105 Page 3 of 5 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/12/105to local or systemic allergic anaphylactic reactions [17]. It is also an additive in many of the non-live vaccines the pa-tient received in childhood without incident and extensiveepidemiological studies have not found a link betweenneurological adverse events following immunization (AEFI) and additives or adjuvants in vaccines [18]. Autoimmune mechanisms post-vaccination may help explain recurrent mononeuritis AEFI. Mutsch et al. pro- posed an autoimmune cause from vaccine adjuvantsamongst other etiologies for Bell 's palsy associated with an inactivated intra-nasal influenza vaccine [19]. Clifford et al. reported three cases of orchitis post-measles mumps rubellavaccine, which were possibly auto-immune related given a short-time course to develop ment of inflammation [20]. The typical incubation period for wild type measles in- fection is approximately 10 days (range 7 -18 days); at- tenuation has been shown to increase the incubationperiod for some vaccines including measles [21]. This isalso reflected in varicella infections, where development ofantibodies post vaccination to vaccine strain virus appearlater compared to those in wild type infection (range 10- 21 days for wild type) [22]. Mumps and rubella have incu- bation periods of and 12-23 days respectively[12]. Our patient 's incubation period was 5 days after MMR vaccine and 28 days after varicella vaccine in histwo recurrent episodes, which therefore could possibly be the result of a vaccine strain infection invading and affect-ing the nerve root. In adults, nerve palsies can be secondary to an ische- mic mononeuropathy [23], but there was no evidence of this on MRI and is unlikely in the pediatric age group.They can also be triggered by inflammatory conditionssuch as systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), but againthere was no evidence of such an etiology in this case,with a normal ESR and no CSF pleocytosis. Although the Hib-Hepatitis B vaccine was also adminis- tered, the delayed onset (7 days) makes Hib or Hepatitis B causation of the patient 'ss y m p t o m sv e r yu n l i k e l ya n dl e s s biologically plausible. As it is an inactivated vaccine, onewould expect to see most reactions occur within 24 hourspost immunisation. There is limited information in the literature regarding the safety of a repeat dose of a live vaccine in this setting.As detailed above, a recurrent case of a nerve palsy hasbeen described post MMR [5,7]. A second and further dose is recommended to increase the likelihood of sero- conversion, but ultimately further immunizations shouldbe considered on an individual basis. If travel is plannedto a country endemic with measles, mumps or rubella,serological assessment could be undertaken to determineadequate sero-conversion. Within Australia however,where endemic measles is eliminated, and the rates ofmumps and rubella are 0.6 and 0.15 per 100,000 per year respectively [12], the risk of non-immunization is relativelylow. Whilst in this case it was felt appropriate to not administer any further live-attenuated vaccines, it wasrecommended to continue scheduled non-live vaccines,including diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (dTap). Conclusions In general, prognosis for benign recurrent 6thnerve palsy is excellent. The majority of pa tients recover full muscle func- tion and have resolution of all symptoms [14]. Benign 6th nerve palsy post-immunization is a rare occurrence thatgenerally resolves spontaneously but needs to be thoroughly investigated and followed-up to ensure best outcome. The exact pathophysiology is unknown but could be related to autoimmune mechanisms or local demyelination. Futureimmunizations should be considered on a case-by-casebasis.
