While this orthodontic treatment comes with several benefits - from shorter average treatment times to hassle-free oral hygiene - one of the biggest draws is the discreet appearance. But what happens if your aligners begin to yellow? Fortunately, that's where the cleaning crystals come in. For a step-by-step guide on how to use your Invisalign cleaning crystals, read on! How to Use Your Invisalign Cleaning Crystals Luckily, using the Invisalign cleaning crystals isn't a complicated process. Here's how to use them properly: - Step #1: Fill a clean cup with warm water and a packet of cleaning crystals. - Step #2: Remove your aligners and rinse them under lukewarm tap water. - Step #3: Carefully place your aligners in the cup. - Step #4: Gently shake the cup to dissolve the cleaning crystals. - Step #5: Let your aligners soak for 15 minutes or so, gently shaking the cup periodically. - Step #6: Remove your aligners, rinse them with tap water again, and place them back in your mouth. How Often Should You Use the Cleaning Crystals? In your Invisalign welcome kit, you'll receive a handful of cleaning crystals. Initially, this might not seem like enough; however, you shouldn't need to soak your aligners on a weekly basis. There are a few reasons for this. To begin, you'll be switching your aligners every 7 to 14 days. If you end up wearing them longer than that (like while you're waiting for your retainer to arrive), then you may want to use a packet of cleaning crystals to give them a deeper clean. Additionally, the best practices provided by your orthodontist should be enough to keep them stain-free. 5 Additional Ways to Keep Your Aligners Stain-Free As previously mentioned, cleaning crystals aren't the only way to ensure your aligners don't turn yellow. To keep them clean and clear, make sure to also: - Rinse them with clean water each time you take them out - Place them in their designated storage case when you aren't wearing them - Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and water to clean them after each meal - Never use harsh chemicals, like bleach - Never drink soda, coffee, wine, or any other dark-colored beverages with them in While your aligners will be clear upon arrival, it's ultimately up to you to keep them stain-free. Don't worry - that task will be easy with the above best practices and the packets of cleaning crystals!
