Following are some of our observations based on our clinical experience of treating a large number of patients (clinical observations): Avoid sour food Foods that are excessively sour should be avoided. The sourness of the food may potentially inhibit the production of melanin due to its acidic nature. Patients with vitiligo are suggested to refrain from eating citrus fruits, sour yogurt, sour pickles, and other sour foods. However, ripe fruits that are rich in vitamin C may be consumed. The author of this write-up is of the opinion is that since the process of melanin formation calls for physiological pH, in the process where tyrosinase converts tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and then to dopaquinone, intake of sour foods may work adversely, hence hampering the process of melanogenesis. Do Not Eat Non-vegetarian food Non-vegetarian foods should be better avoided, as much as possible, as they act as a foreign body to the pigment cells. At Life Force, we have observed that certain fish lead to sudden aggravation of vitiligo in some patients. Also, it has been observed that industrial chemicals (such as mercury) could enter our body through seafood, especially fish; so it should better be avoided in your vitiligo diet. Stay away from artificial food colors Artificial colors used in various food preparations may better be reduced or avoided as far as possible. There may not be enough scientific evidence to prove how these foods worsen leucoderma (vitiligo), but our clinical experience has shown that many patients report worsening of their [vitiligo](https://www.askdrshah.com/app/vitiligo/vitiligo.aspx) after consuming these items, and hence they are better avoided. Avoid using creams/fruits containing hydroquinone It is very important to take care that foods comprising hydroquinone, which is a prominent depigmenting agent present in various skin bleaching creams, should be avoided when you are combating vitiligo. Certain fruits, such as blueberries and pears, contain hydroquinone which minimizes melanin production. So, make sure you do not add fruits, such as blueberries and pears, to your vitiligo diet as they may make your white skin patches whiter and aggravate the condition. Have food high In Zinc Increase your intake of foods, which are rich in zinc, when you are suffering from vitiligo. An increase in the levels of zinc in your body can help cure vitiligo to a great extent. Also, you can add nuts, beans, and dairy foods to your regular diet to boost the levels of zinc in your body. Add Vitamin B-12 Rich Foods In Diet The consumption of vitamin B-12 rich foods is highly effective in reversing vitiligo. Various medical studies and researches reveal that deficiency of vitamin B-12 tends to cause a boost in homocysteine, which is a compound responsible for the destruction of skin pigmentation in various parts of your body. So, you need to include vitamin B-12 rich foods in your regular diet for vitiligo. Make sure you eat fortified breakfast cereals, yogurt, and other vitamins B-12 abundant foods. Eat Folate-Rich Foods Low folate levels in your body are known to be one of the prominent causes of vitiligo. Modifying your regular diet by adding some foods abundant in folate can help boost your intake of folate easily. Make sure you have cereals rich in folate in your regular breakfast. Also, adding nutritious foods, such as spinach, broccoli, black-eyed peas, and asparagus, to your daily diet can help boost your folate levels and help in reversing vitiligo significantly.
