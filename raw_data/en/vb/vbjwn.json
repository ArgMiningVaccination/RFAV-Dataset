Included in the procedures that were established for the development of this Budget was a provision for review of new programs and the presentation of recommendations by the Commonwealth Priorities Commission. The work of this distinguished Com- mission has been referred to throughout the Budget. The budgeting process has also been influenced by the major changes that are being made in preparation for the adoption of the Planning-Programming- Budgeting System. We have included a section in the Summary Volume in- dicating an outline which is indicative of the Program Structure and some classifications that are appropriate to the PPB System. The development of this Budget has also been influenced by the Con- stitutional changes and are being implemented at this time. These changes principally affect the financing of long term capital projects and the cost associated with this financing which appears as an operating expense in the Budget. We have presented the Budget in five volumes. Volume I is a Summary Volume which includes the Governor's Message. The Summary Volume also contains broad statements of appropriations and expenditures combining the General Fund and the Special Funds, Summaries of Revenues, and, as mentioned previously, some information which will be helpful in an under- standing of the Planning-Programming-Budgeting System. Volume II presents our General Fund Budget recommendations in detail and by the classifications that have been traditionally used in the presentation of this document. We have attempted to make the presentation as clear and informative as possible, including estimates of lapses and amounts that have been appropriated or provided in the previous fiscal year. The Budget recom- mendations will always appear in the extreme right hand column of the Schedules for your convenience. Volume III is a presentation of the budget recommendations for the Special Funds. The timing of the presentation of this document has been accelerated to coincide with the presentation of the General Fund budget. Our intention is to indicate that the financial planning of the Commonwealth must have as a foundation a coordinated systematic approach which takes into account the requirements of all of the activities of the Commonwealth regardless of the funding provisions that have been mandated by law. The responsibilities of government have increased, and the demands upon the taxpayers to finance these activities have also necessarily increased. It is imperative that we consider all financial needs at one time. Volume W contains the Five-Year Plan. This is the first time that any state has undertaken to present financial requirements for a period of five years. Governor Shafer in his message to the Legislature in January 1968 made a commitment to present a Five-Year Plan. This year he has kept that com- mitment and this is presented in this fourth volume. All departments of the Commonwealth were required to consider their programs, plans and re- quirements in this greatly expanded time frame. This made the task of developing the Budget much more complex, but we have a much better foundation as a result of the effort that was involved in making this forecast. In addition, this plan of the Governor was written into the constitutional changes thus assuring the continuance of this progressive step. In subse- quent years we will improve our forecasting methods and develop the neces- sary technical competence to help prudently plan the State's long-range fiscal requirements. We have included in this planning volume summary statements and comments on the assumptions and ground rules that have been used in the ilL Summary development of the four-year forecast of appropriations and revenues. There are also included certain statistics and highlights which we felt might be of interest in analyzing the significance of the trends. One of the benefits of adopting a five-year plan is the ability to obtain a clearer understanding of where the State stands in a fiscal sense, where it is going and what has transpired to change and revise the plans as a result of changing conditions. This document will improve our ability to do this through the establishment of the reference point and the revisions to the four-year forecast that occur with the submission of the Governor's Budget annually. Volume V presents the Capital Budget of the Commonwealth. It in- corporates many of the recommendations of the Capital Program of the State Planning Board. One of the principal reasons for the preparation of this document is to establish a guidepost which will indicate where we stand with respect to those projects previously authorized and in some state of design planning for construction. It is important that we do this because of the limitations on total Commonwealth debt which have been included in the constitutional changes proposed and adopted during 1968. Our over-all fiscal requirements should be considered while we plan and adopt new programs for capital expansion. Such programs almost always entail additional operat- ing expense commitments. The Planning-Programming-Budgeting System will correlate the effects of decisions to construct institutions of every type and also to maintain and staff these institutions. This fifth volume will be published by March 1. iv INTEREST IS SINKING FUND REQUIREMENTS .70 REFUNDS .60 G.S.A.

SHAFER January 28, 1969 Mr. Lieutenant Governor, Mr. Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the General Assembly, my fellow Pennsylvanians: A FINANCIAL PLAN This is a historic day. For you are receiving the most innovative, long-range financial plan ever presented to a legislative body in the United States. In no other budget will you find the new approaches we are taking to solve the fiscal crisis of our Commonwealth\u2014a crisis that is faced by every other state and local government across this Nation. Our plan contains the experimental work of the first Priorities Commission ever assembled\u2014a broad-based group of citizens who recognize the needs of our State and, at the same time, understand that first things must come first, as the revenue \"crunch\" becomes a critical reality to every citizen and taxpayer. It contains the work of an oustanding group of economists, who serve as my economic advisers, and who, for the first time,, are giving our Commonwealth data needed to make sounder financial decisions. It contains the work of labor and business leaders, educators, tax experts, and other citizens, all members of the bipartisan Tax Study and Revision Commission, which has completed one of the most penetrating, and enlightening studies of Pennsylvania's tax struc- ture ever undertaken. It contains the work of dedicated members of my Administra- tion, who are using the most modern business techniques to make the budget process more efficient and understandable. For the first time, you will be given sample presentations of data prodtked by the Planning-Programming-Budgeting System\u2014the most revolu- tionary management and fiscal planning tool of the century. Truth in Spending We have indeed created a budgetary revolution\u2014a revolution that has produced the first five-year budget in the history of our Com- monwealth and Nation. No longer will we look at programs and their cost from year-to- year, avoiding the realities of the future. We will now see before us the total picture for five years\u2014not just for general fund spending, but for all spending, including the special funds and capital programs. Even the standard format used to present the budget in past years has been ripped up and replaced with modern, readable docu- ments, that can be understood by anyone willing to take the time to study them\u2014something that is done by too few! These documents\u2014five in all\u2014will contain the general and special funds, the capital fund (which will be submitted at a later date), the four-year forecast of expenditures, and information that has never before been available in a budget, such as the total spending 1 It II 11 II II II Budget Message requests made by departments, lapses by program, details of revenue estimates, statistics on mandated, expanded and new programs, and facts about the number of State employes. This is without a doubt a major step in the \"truth-in-spending\" plan we began last year for the taxpayers of Pennsylvania\u2014a plan that requires that we show the people the future price tag of programs that are undertaken, together with the necessary revenues to pay for them. How many times have those of us in this Hall, who have partici- pated in the budget process, complained loudly that we vote for a program and, by the time we are ready to approve the next year's cost, it has soared millions of dollars that were not anticipated. End Unplanned Spending This financial plan will put an end to unplanned and uncon- trolled spending. Now we will have a better comprehension of where we are headed in the financial woods of government. Together, you and I face an anomaly almost daily. We hear citizens complain that they need better highways; better schools, colleges, universities and more financial assistance for their children; better mental hospitals and programs for those of their family afflicted by mental illness and retardation; better nursing homes for their aged parents; more welfare assistance for their children; more money for cleaning up the streams for purer water and better fishing; in- creased assistance to their local governments for better housing, recre- ation and transportation; expanded industrial development programs to give them better jobs. At the same time, when the subject of providing the tax revenues to pay the bill is discussed, these same citizens complain that the price is too high\u2014\"cut other appropriations but leave mine alone,\" they say. We are told that the education systems of Philadelphia, Pitts- burgh and other cities cannot survive without huge new injections of State assistance. Mayor Tate, Mayor Barr and leaders of other cities tell us the Commonwealth is failing to meet its obligations to their citizens. This is no small problem, ladies and gentlemen of the General Assembly. For many of those who advocate spending more, all too often, fail to support the measures that raise the money to pay the price. Progress and the Future It's easy, irresponsible politics to claim the money is available\u2014 to tell a constituent that the Governor has the money hidden away somewhere and doesn't want you to have it. It's an easy irresponsible politics that has got to end or the crisis of our cities will be the holo- caust of our cities\u2014a disaster that will reach into every Pennsyl- vanian's life, whether he -lives on Rittenhouse Square or in Frosty Valley. On the other hand, we are warned of an impending taxpayers' revolt that would shake any politician in his shoes if . additional reve- nues are sought. I have been advised to heed that warning by many whose politi- cal judgnieht I respect\u2014many of you sitting in' this . Hall tOday. 1 1 2 Budget Message And, very candidly, I gave serious thought to this politically easy path. But such thoughts were not long lived when I faced the reality of Pennsylvania's needs and her future health, growth and potential. I thought of a recent discussion with my economic advisers, who said young people and their talent for creating a better Pennsylvania are still leaving our State in too large a number because we have not convinced them yet that opportunity is here. I thought back to that time when young people started to leave after World War II and to the failure of Pennsylvania to respond strongly and creatively enough to her problems. The result was job- lessness and economic stagnation. I thought about the new progress we must make in our mental hospitals, our schools, in combatting crime, in providing decent salaries for teachers and State employees. I could reach only one conclusion. That I was elected Governor of Pennsylvania, not to make the easy political decisions, but to make the hard, leadership decisions that will keep Pennsylvania on a straight and balanced course into the next decade. Regardless of the political consequences, I must do what I believe is right after looking at all the facts. That is what I am attempting to do with this budget\u2014a budget of investment in people and their needs. WHERE THE MONEY GOES The only reason we have a budget is to mutually provide services to meet needs we cannot meet as individuals or families. In the new budget our major contributions are in two major areas: Education-56 percent or $1.4 billion. Health and Welfare-23 percent or $583 million. All other-21 percent or $513 million. Some 78 percent of the new budget is being returned to the taxpayers at the local level in the form of grants and subsidies and debt. Another 15 percent is used to operate our colleges, hospitals and to pay retirement and social security benefits for employes, as every employer should. Too many people fail to realize that only a small portion of their tax money goes toward operating and administering the services- 7.6 percent of the new budget. Cost Reduction and Efficiency I am proud that during my two years as Governor we have been able to reduce the total cost of operating State Government in compari- son to other Administrations. My Administration will continue its efforts to make State Govern- ment more efficient 'through modernization .and an aggressive cost reduction program. We have made some great strides. Computerization of public assistance checks; which originally met with partisan opposition, will savethe taxpayers $712;000 a year through centralization of services and -the elimination of larpositions. Our cost reduction teams are at %with turning uh new ways to II 11 11 11 ft 3 Budget Message improve efficiency and cut costs. Only recently I presented awards to nine State employes whose ideas will save the Commonwealth $5 million a year through such things as changing the method of pur- chasing furniture at State colleges ($880,000 savings) and reclaiming silver from X-ray baths and selling it (a savings of $15,000). I recommend that you join me in another important way to improve efficiency by approving the broad State Government re- organization and modernization plan I will submit to you this year. Although this may be politically hard to achieve, it will be worth it to the taxpayers. We estimate that consolidation of some depart- ments and agencies could reduce State employment by at least 4,000 persons once the plan goes into effect. I also urge you to give prompt approval to the new bill we are preparing for the merger of the Departments of Public Welfare and Health. This, it can be shown, will save an estimated $10 million a year. THE TAXPAYER The question is: Are the taxpayers getting their moneys' worth? Before you answer that too quickly, I would suggest you con- sider some pertinent facts that show Pennsylvania to be a relatively low tax state, especially among the industrial, heavily populated states. U. S. Census Bureau figures show that Pennsylvania is 29th among all the states in the amount of taxes paid for each resident. Internal Revenue Service figures show that a family of four earning $9,000 a year pays less in sales taxes than the other major states\u2014as a matter of fact Pennsylvania is 26th on the deduction list supplied by IRS. Other information shows that our state and local tax on a family of four earning $8,000 a year is lower than in any of the states surrounding us except West Virginia. It is my opinion that in Pennsylvania we are spending the tax dollar more effectively than in any of our sister states. Information in the report of the Tax Study and Revision . Com- mission and the Taxation Handbook, which are in the budget mate- rials you received today, explodes many of the erroneous statements that are being made by some critics, especially the belief that we have the biggest sales tax in the Nation. It is just not true. These are facts that you and the people of Pennsylvania need to know in making your decision about this year's budget problem. I propose this budget to accomplish two major objectives: \u2014To make certain the people are not underserved. \u2014To make certain they are not overtaxed. I believe we can accomplish that. PEOPLE SERVED Consider for a moment who it is that receives the services. Con- sider how many lives will be influenced by the proposals made here today. There are 2.3 million school children, their families and the 100,000 public school teachers who understand the importance of this budget to them. That's one-quarter of our population. And the families and teachers pay taxes. 1 4 It Budget Message Our commitment to the improvement of basic education is re- flected in the fact that for the first time the State will pick up half the bill for public education if you approve the one billion, fifty three million dollars ($1.053 billion) I recommend. You also will provide for a crash education program for the ghetto and rural poverty areas of our Commonwealth where children need special help if they are to learn enough to meet modern challenges. From the school children we turn to the 239,000 students, their families and the 29,000 professors in our Commonwealth System of Higher Education. Among the students are some of the 145,000 in both public and private colleges and universities who are receiving scholarship and loan assistance from us. Their families and professors pay taxes, and the students soon will, at a rate that will reflect higher income; be- cause we helped them get a higher education. They know the importance of the $352 million for higher educa- tion recommended in this budget. Crime and Mental Health Every taxpayer and citizen knows the need for making new and effective efforts to combat crime, prevent consumer fraud and provid- ing for a modern system of criminal justice in our courts and in our correctional institutions. The $30 million I am recommending in this area is absolutely essential if these programs are to be effective. I know there are few, if any in this Hall, who do not recognize with compassion the needs of those citizens afflicted with mental ill- ness or the injury of retardation. But we feel the pain far less than the families of the 42,000 patients in our mental hospitals and insti- tutions for the mentally retarded and the 41,000 who await the bene- fits of our new Community Mental Health and Mental Retardation Program. That is why I have recommended an increase of $33 million for our mental hospitals and $17 million for our community mental health and retardation centers, which will bring our total effort in this most needed service to $200 million. I need not remind you that some citizens have asked that much more be spent in this area immediately. Certainly, we should con- sider the priority of that request. From the mentally ill and retarded, we turn to those citizens who need medical and health care and have nowhere to turn but to the State. There are one million seeking this aid and I recommend we provide $70 million for this assistance\u2014a small increase over this year's expenditure. People in Need The $232 million recommended for our public assistance program will help 303,000 children, their parents or guardians and 85.000 aged, blind and disabled citizens maintain a minimum level of decency recommended in the Woodbury Report. There is not one taxpayer in this Commonwealth that doesn't have a vital stake in our programs to improve our health and the environment\u2014programs which total $53.4 million. This money will be spent to help us clean pollution from the water We drink, the air we breathe and the land on which we live, work and play. 5 It II 11 II II ii Budget Message Along with this expenditure, I recommend we provide $65 million to help our urban dwellers\u2014(who represent four out of every five Pennsylvanians)\u2014solve the problems they face in deteriorating neighborhoods, hard core unemployment, housing and code enforce- ment, urban planning and renewal. Economic Backbone Included in this are $13.1 million for the improvement of mass transportation and to develop the high speed Keystone Corridor This corridor will be the new backbone of Pennsylvania's economic growth\u2014a growth that is vital to all communities no matter what size, or where they are located in the Commonwealth. This corridor, linked to our rapidly expanding system of high- ways, will keep us in the key position as the hub state between the East Coast and the industrial Great Lakes Region. To assure the continuation of our record-breaking highway con- struction program, I am recommending, in the highway fund section of this budget, that we increase expenditures to one billion, six million dollars ($1.006 billion), including our proposed plan to eliminate safety hazards. You will find a more detailed list of all these proposals attached to the written copy of this message, which you will receive today. PRIORITIES COMMISSION You will note that recommendations of the Priorities Commission are included in these proposals\u2014recommendations that give high priority to solving our urban problems. It is important for us to note what the Commission said of its work. I quote: \"The priority ranking of developmental increments in no way constitutes an endorsement of existing total expenditure levels for given programs or of the existing program structure. Indeed, mem- bers of the Commission are in accord that their work to this point is preparatory to the more complete and time consuming analysis\u2014a detailed critical examination of all state expenditures in terms of their appropriateness, total expenditure level and efficiency.\" Unprecedented Experiment It is important that we recognize that the Commission is breaking new ground for budget making\u2014that it is part of an experiment that has never been tried before. For the first time, we in State Government have asked those citizen-leaders, who represent groups making demands on the tax dollars, to sit down together and decide what is most important. The Commission report states this objective well: \"Bringing together representatives of different groups repre- sented far more than an attempt to generate advance concensus on the budget. \"Rather, it represented an effort to generate an awareness in each participant that, though the organization, institution, or interest that he represented might be pursuing some worthwhile objective . . there were other organizations which were also pursuing worthwhile objectives and that they were entitled to make similar claims.. \"Participation in the Commission's deliberations brought home 1 6 II Budget Message forcibly to these individuals the realization that the Commonwealth could not meet all their demands, and that they consequently must begin to rethink their own objectives and restructure their opera- tions.\" Recognizing that the task of analyzing every existing program could not be done in a year, the Commission turned to the new demands and requests made of this budget. In recommending the $163 million for new and expanded pro- grams, the Commission said a reduction in this level will \"seriously impede the well-being of the citizens of Pennsylvania and the progress of the economy of the Commonwealth.\" I agree. I also agree that the Commission, made up of some of our most dedicated and intelligent citizens, should continue its work so that the job of setting priorities for all spending can be achieved. THE FISCAL RUBICON This brings us to Pennsylvania's fiscal Rubicon. And as we line up on the shore, deciding whether to cross, we must clearly understand the magnitude of the 'problem. This is ex- tremely important because there are several attitudes shaping up about this budget. All of us should realize that no matter what course we finally take\u2014cut back, stand pat, or go forward, it will be a tough one. For those of you who say cut back to live within the present revenue structure, you will have to cut $333 million in programs. For those of you who believe it is your responsibility to provide for the normal and mandated increases, you will be required to raise $333 million in new revenues. For those of you who believe that we, should take the forward course I am recommending to keep Pennsylvania growing, you will be required to raise $492 million in new revenues, Fiscal Facts Here are the figures supporting these statements: Expenditures for the present fiscal year will be approximately one billion, nine hundred and seventy-eight million dollars ($1.978 billion). This means we will have a surplus of approximately $29 million from this year to apply to the new budget. Revenues for 1969-70 from the present sources are estimated at $2 billion, leaving us with a total of two billion, twenty-nine million dollars ($2.029 billion) to work with. , o Normal increases for 1969-70 are $134 - million. These in- creases result from inflation and rising costs, increased numbers of people served by programs, such as school population, and salary increases. Mandated increases' in the neW budget are approximately $297 million. These are increases called for by law : They must be made until the law is repealed or changed. I have considered the new funds called for in Act 96, when revenues are available, to be a mandate. These mandates are clearly set forth in the general fund section and in the printed copy of this message. They include such things as the public school subsidy, public assistance, community colleges and community mental health services. II Ii . Budget Message MANDATED INCREASES (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Increase Expend. Decrease Budget Public School Subsidies: Present Law $ 708,589* $ 48,382 $ 756,971 Implementation of Act No. 96 160,591 160,591 35,895 Occupational 41,400 Additional 300 State Police Troopers 552 552 New Court Administration System 500 500 Meat and Poultry Inspection 461 382 843 Total $1,124,421 $ 296,977 $1,421.398 *Excludes the 1968-69 Teachers Pay Increase of $44,700 and $2,364 for Closed Schools. The requirement for the latter is eliminated by Act No. 96. These items are excluded in order to reflect the actual increase since they are non-recurring in 1969-70. The Revenue Gap Existing programs with the mandated and normal increases, bring the 1969-70 budget to a total of two billion, three hundred sixty two million ($2.362 billion), without one new program or expansion. With estimated revenues at two billion, twenty nine million ($2.029 billion) our revenue gap is $333 million. I not only recommend we close this gap as responsible leaders of Pennsylvania, but that we add $160 million for the programs that received the highest priority approval of the Priorities Commission- 60 percent of which are for the urban crisis. I have carefully considered these programs. I believe that each one is vitally important to helping us solve present crises and to preparing creative paths to the future. That means the blueprint for Pennsylvania's future that I am recommending to you totals two billion, five hundred twenty one million, eight hundred thirty six thousand dollars ($2,521,836,000). New revenues needed to balance this budget total four hundred ninety two million, five hundred ninety three thousand dollars ($492,593,000). EDUCATION AND WELFARE COSTS Before proposing how we pay the bill, I want to discuss a major concern I have about the rising cost of our education and welfare systems. Education costs alone are staggering in the forecasts. In less than ten years, the State's share of public basic and secondary education 8 Budget Message is expected to increase by 70 percent over what I propose we spend this year. This will happen even with an expected decline in the student population. Something must and can be done about this. Many new ap- proaches to teaching, facilities and other education functions are be- ing proposed from many different sources. We should be cautious that we organize to get the best result and not allow our concern to force us into piecemeal improvements. The sensible way to me is to get the best minds available\u2014minds that are independent from our education process to show us what is wrong with the system and how we can improve its efficiency and still provide quality education for our children. The Priorities Commission, recognizing this need, recommended $1.5 million for an independent reexamination of our basic and sec- ondary education system, similar to one recently completed in Texas. It will take between two and three years to get the job done right, but it would be time and money well spent to save millions of dollars. New Look at Welfare In welfare, we have established a system that is helping those who need help, but at the same time perpetuating the poverty cycle for others. We must find a new way to provide more incentives to break the poverty cycle and bring recipients into the mainstream, especially the children as they enter adulthood. As in education, many new approaches are being considered. To help us find a new path, I am asking the Priorities Commission to study our present system as its number one priority as it begins its new work of analyzing State Government program-by-program. This approach should not be construed as a negative attack on those we are helping today. There is no question that the welfare program is a popular target, because many citizens think it is nothing but a dole. The facts prove much differently. Of the 430,000 people we pro- pose to help this year some 303,000 will be children and 85,000 will be blind, aged or disabled. The consequences of not providing adequate assistance to these citizens would be barbaric. We must help them until a better solution is found. REVENUE SHARING AND BLOC GRANTS Besides our efforts to restore fiscal balance at the State level, we also must do more to impress on the Federal Government the need to return a fairer share of the tax dollar to the states. As a member of the National Governors' Conference Executive Committee and Vice Chairman of the Republican Governors' Associa- tion this year, I will do everything in my power to have the new Administration of President Nixon and the Congress support a legiti- mate program of revenue sharing. Part of our State revenue problem is that the Federal Govern- ment has preempted the major source of revenue in the United States. It now collects two-thirds of all the taxes. We cannot expect to have a balanced federalism if this inequity is not corrected. 9 11 II II II It It is Ii Budget Message In addition, I think it is imperative that the present system of Federal categorical aid is wasteful. It should be consolidated into a bloc grant system, which would permit the states and local govern- ment far more flexibility in using Federal funds for the needs of the particular state. Both the revenue sharing and bloc grant concepts have the en- dorsement of all the governors. With the support of the legislatures in the 50 states, we will form a powerful force to get some action. I will have more to say on this subject in the coming weeks. ACROSS THE RUBICON And now the time has come to cross the Rubicon. I recommend we cross it by following the course charted by the bipartisan Tax Study and Revision Commission, which has been working on our revenue problems for two years. The Commission has given us a tax pattern to develop, not specific taxes to enact. Democrats and Republicans alike on the Commission concluded that, to meet Pennsylvania's forseeable revenue needs, we must rely mainly on personal and corporate income taxes. At the same time, the members warned that we should not dis- turb the present ratio of 70 percent general taxes and 30 percent corporate taxes. This, the Commission noted, was the best ratio to keep a healthy economic growth climate\u2014a climate that over the past six years has produced more than 600,000 new jobs. I agree with the Commission's findings. I am personally con- vinced that Pennsylvania can no longer expect to grow with vigor and competitively with other states without a personal income tax. This is not politically easy to say, but it must be said. We have been trying to avoid the reality for too long. Taxation Handbook In the \"Taxation Handbook\" I mentioned to you earlier, you will find some recommended courses we can follow to raise revenues. They are in line with the tax pattern proposed by the Tax Commis- sion. ask you to study this information carefully before closing your minds to the needs of Pennsylvania in preference to the pain of increasing revenues. The Handbook contains several combinations of general tax proposals, which show the amount of revenue we could expect from a reduction in the sales tax and enactment of a personal income tax. These alternative general tax plans are accompanied with a plan to increase direct corporate taxes by $151 million - in line with the Commission's recommendation to keep the ratio at 70-30. I offer you this plan for your consideration as you begin work on the budget. Each one of you, I know, will exercise his or her responsi- bility to the people by closely examining what is proposed. Joint Responsibility -It is your responsibility to approve the appropriations and the revenue to pay the bill. 10 II Budget Message And with that statement I am not saying: \"It's your problem, solve it.\" On the contrary, I want each of you to know that I stand ready to work and cooperate with you. I am prepared to meet any reason- able request for an increase or decrease in this budget. Those of you with alternate proposals will have my fullest co- operation and the cooperation of everyone in my Administration. I only ask that we meet this problem together as reasonable men trying to solve our differences, holding partisanship to a minimum. I believe this to be a reasonable request and I think the people of the Commonwealth would agree, since we are working to solve a problem that vitally influences their lives. If you are not getting information you want from the executive\" branch, tell me first so I can do something about it. Crucial Legislative Year In order to assure this kind of exchange and cooperation, I pro- pose that we establish immediately a bipartisan Legislative-Executive Liaison Committee for the Budget, which will serve to keep the channels of communication and negotiation open at all times. A formal proposal for establishing this committee has been sent to your leadership. In addition, I feel very strongly that every member of the General Assembly should have the advantage of a budget briefing. I suggest you invite the Budget Secretary to brief you during your individual caucuses before the appropriation committees begin their hearings. We are headed without doubt for one of the most controversial and difficult legislative years in the Commonwealth's history. I am hopeful that you will begin work on the budget with dis- patch so that we can arrive at an agreement before the end of the fiscal year. 13 11 FORWARD TO THE 70's You now have more information about a budget than ever before given to members of the General Assembly. You have the report of the Priorities Commission, which must be read if you are to undertsand what these citizens are trying to achieve. You have the two-year report of the Tax Study and Revision Commission. You have the first five-year budget in the history of any state. You now have my personal thinking as Governor. Now, it is your turn as the elected leaders of the people. It is a turn that will measure the kind of leadership we have in Pennsylvania. And leadership during this time of turmoil is not easy. There is apathy and anger among the people\u2014the middle ground is getting narrower. 11 Recovery and Progress I ask you to keep one thing in mind as you deliberate: Pennsyl- vania has come a long way toward full recovery from the problems we faced at the beginning of this decade. We have had to move fast 11 Budget Message to catch up and provide opportunity for all citizens. We are getting there and if we stay on a balanced course we will share abundantly in the coming prosperity of the 1970's. Remember: History does not measure us for how long we serve, but for what good is done during the time we serve. Personally and quite candidly, I couldn't help but enjoy the temporary acclaim that would come from some by my not proposing new programs and new revenue measures. But I am more persuaded by the words John Gardner spoke as he left his post as Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare! He said: \"I believe that history will not deal kindly with a rich Nation that will not tax itself to cure its own miseries.\" I trust that you end your delberations with the same belief. Thank you.

GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE 1 APPENDIX 1 I Ii I I I I I 13 I Budget Message II PLAN N I NG\u2014PROGRAMM I NG\u2014B U DGETI NG SYSTEM Although the Priorities Commission will help solve an immediate need of determining Commonwealth priorities, an ongoing system must be installed in State Government to enable decision makers to allocate resources according to priorities on a continuing basis. The system selected is popularly known as the Planning-Programming- Budgeting System (PPBS). PPBS is a management system cur- rently being developed in Federal government agencies, the major industrial states of the nation, and some of the largest counties and cities in the United States. Each agency under the Governor's jurisdiction has been asked to designate a PPBS coordinator who will serve as the focal point within the agency on all matters pertaining to PPBS. In addition, in eleven of the major agencies, task forces have been appointed to work on PPBS tasks in program areas where those agencies have prime responsibility. The PPE project was begun in March of 1968 and is to be com- pleted by January, 1971. It is planned that the design and imple- mentation phase of the Project will be completed by January, 1910. The final year will allow, time during which the operational system will be evaluated and adjusted or revised as may be necessary. Pennsylvania is confronted with a problem which is shared by all governments. The demands for governmental services are greater than government's resources and ability to satisfy those demands. Indeed, these demands will probably continue to increase at a much faster rate than the available resources. Since governments do not have enough resources to satisfy all demands, they are forced to decide among alternative expenditure patterns. Government's prob- lem of making rational allocations of public resources is a most for- midable one. PPB will, for budgetary purposes, transcend organizational lines. All functions which contribute to specific objectives will be aggregated into similar categories. Next year the budget presenta- tion will be made on the basis of categories of activities. Appropria- tions will then be allotted to the various agencies which perform the specific activities. In addition, PPBS will enable the Commonwealth to determine more accurately the cost of all programs. First, since functions will be aggregated into programs which transcend organizational units, the cost of any given type of activity will be considered as a unit, and not as parts of different agency budgets. Second, PPBS will record more accurately costs which are to be incurred by a program. By assigning all costs to the appropriate program, the Capital Budget will be integrated with the operating budget, in order to obtain a realistic representation of total program costs. Often the physical plant, required to operate a program is not considered as a program cost. 15 Budget Message PLANNING\u2014PROGRAMMING\u2014BUDGETING SYSTEM 1969-70 BUDGET GENERAL AND SPECIAL FUNDS (Dollar Amounts n Thousands) Commonwealth Programs General Administration and Support $ 68,594 Protection of Persons and Property ....... ...... ..... 116,857 1,418,979 Social Development - 61,674 Economic Development ... 391,950 Transportation and Communication 514,921 Recreation and Cultural Enrichment 37,811 Sub-Total $2,978,110 Debt Service and Refunds _ 101,286 - 70,668 Total State Funds ............. ------- $3,150,064 1 16 Ii II 13 II II II II Budget Message Finally, PPBS will aid the Commonwealth to anticipate the fu- ture as well as the present program costs. This is extremely impor- tant since the first year cost of a program is often insignificant in comparison with the future year costs. PPBS requires that program administrators project annual program costs for four years beyond the budget year. This will enable the Governor and legislators to see clearly the future implications of a program before they commit Commonwealth resources to it. In addition to being an integral part of PPBS, the multi-year budget is now required by the Common- wealth Constitution. PPBS will assist the Commonwealth in measuring the outputs of its programs, these being the end products resulting from activities supported by Commonwealth resources. Currently, appropriations are made primarily in terms of inputs such as the amount of money to be spent, the number of employes to be hired, etc. Not enough emphasis is placed upon the output which will result from spending this money or hiring these employes. Consequently, the Common- wealth knows the amount of money that is spent and for what it is spent, but not always what benefits to society result from the ex- penditures. The PPBS process will focus on an attempt to measure the outputs of Commonwealth activities. Budget requests will specify the output levels that agencies expect to obtain. Under PPBS economic analysis of various Commonwealth pro- grams will be performed. This analysis will be of the cost-benefit genre which attempts to measure the benefits accrued to the public from any particular program in relation to the cost of the program. This analysis will take into consideration three primary factors: the total cost of program, the total benefits resulting from the program, and the effectiveness of the program in achieving its objectives. The information gained from this analysis will assist the decision makers by greatly increasing their knowledge about the various government programs, and their relative effectiveness Moreover, they will have a much better information base on which to make choices among program mixes and resource allocations. By utilizing modern auto- matic data processing techniques, Commonwealth managers will have an enormous amount of information which can be readily retrieved and the Legislature and the Governor will possess a much wider in- formation base in terms of total program costs, program outputs, and program benefits and effectiveness. Eight \"Commonwealth Programs\" within which all Comm'on- wealth activities have been tentatively aggregated have been devised. The first program, \"General Administration and Support,\" is a means-oriented category which includes all functions whose costs are not directly attributable to any single substantive Program. The other seven Programs are defined as: II. Protection of Persons and Property. To provide an environ- ment and social system in which the lives of individuals, and the property of individuals and organizations are protected from natural and man-made disasters, and from illegal and unfair action. III. Health\u2014Physical and Mental Well-being. To provide an en- vironment in which hazards to physical and mental health are 17 Budget Message minimized; to provide means for the prevention of physical and mental disabilities; and to support a system of health care which will assure the availability of health services to those in need of them. IV. Intellectual Development and Education. To provide a sys- tem of learning experiences and opportunities that will permit each individual to achieve his maximum potential intellectual development. V. Social Development. To provide a system of services for re- inforcing the capacity of individuals, children and families for effective adjustment to society and for minimizing socially aberrant behavior. VI. Economic Development\u2014Personal, Community, and Common- wealth. To provide a system in which the employment op- portunities of individuals, the economic growth and develop- ment of communities and the overall economic development of the Commonwealth will be maximized (including optimum use of natural resources to support economic development). VII. Transportation and Communication. To provide a system in which the movement of individuals goods and information will be maximized within the Commonwealth and interfaced with a national-international system of transportation and communication. VIII. Recreation and Cultural Enrichment. To provide a system of services and support functions to make available opportunities for individual and group recreation and cultural growth. (in- cluding the use of natural resources to support the recreational system). Under the PPB System, agencies will continue to formulate and submit agency budgets, but the agency will be required to justify its budget in terms of the extent to which it will contribute to the achievement of particular goals and objectives. This information will be furnished by the agencies prior to the submission of the actual budget requests in Program Memoranda. Approval of the Program Memoranda will sanction certain courses of action and levels of specific outputs. Following the approval of Program Memoranda, the agencies will submit a Program and Financial Plan (PEP). The PFP will translate the substantive programs encompassed by the approved Program Memoranda into objects of expenditure. The PEP will be evaluated in terms of the number and amount of line item objects which will be required to achieve the output specified in the Pro- gram Memoranda. The PEP will include not only, the expenditure levels for the preceding year and the budget request for the next year but also will show the expected costs of programs for the four successive years. PPB will require a much more sophisticated application of both analysis and planning than is presently employed in the Common- wealth. Program analysis will involve the systematic evaluation of 1 1 1 18 Budget Message programs in terms of their relative effectiveness. Special analytic studies will be conducted in problem areas. Through the use of systems analysis and other modern management methods, these studies will first define the parameters of specific problems and then determine the cause-effect relationships between sustantive programs and desired outputs. Planning, both short-term and long-term, is to be institutional- ized as a management tool. Long-term planning will define loose parameters of courses of actions and guide action towards general goals. Short-term plans, one to five years, will be employed to define more exactly these boundaries and to specify activities which may achieve, as nearly as possible, these goals. PPB will require two important changes in present staffing and personnel procedures. First, a somewhat larger number of persons trained in the management sciences will be needed in order to carry out PPB. These people must be familiar with the use of techniques such as .system analysis, PERT, and computer simulation. In order to fulfill these requirements, extensive training of present employes must be conducted and persons already trained in these skills must he sought. Second, the personnel function will be adapted so that the personnel necessary for the execution of program contained in the approved Program Memoranda will be provided and evaluated in terms of the number and type of employes which will be needed to achieve a particular kind and level of output. Then, if feasible, employes will be hired or trained so as to meet the time constraints of Program Memoranda. Emphasis will be placed upon utilizing per- sonnel already employed by the Commonwealth. This will require that personnel be shifted among agencies in order to meet the man- power needs of various programs as the magnitude of programs and the emphasis upon these programs are shifted.

This will bring the State's share in basic education to more than 50 percent\u2014the goal we have set. Here are the recommended programs: Increase minimum teachers' salary to $6,000 by providing the funds called for in Act 96. Appropriation\u2014$160 million. Increase school subsidies to local districts as mandated because of increase in pupil population, etc. Appropriation\u2014$48 million. . Improve substandard education in the ghettos and rural poverty areas through the following programs recommended by the Priorities Commission: \u2014A nursery and pre-school program for approximately 90,000 two and three-year-old children who live in culturally and economi- cally disadvantaged school districts\u2014$10 million recommended. \u2014Expand poverty education program to meet the special educa- tional needs of children from districts with large concentrations of poverty\u2014$10 million. \u2014Establish educational programs to help functionally illiterate citizens\u2014adult, college and high school age\u2014learn to read and write. Approximately 198,000 persons need this assistance\u2014$8 million. \u2014Provide a special program to give teachers special training AVERAGE ANNUAL COST PER PUBLIC SCHOOL PUPIL IN PENNSYLVANIA (Based on General Fund Expenditures of School Districts) 1959 - 1968 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 (Estimated) Source: Statistical Report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, Pennsylvania Department of Public Instruction.

In 1964-65 there were 258,131 students. We are estimating col- lege population at 376,700 for the purposes of the new budget. The total for higher education is $352 million. Here is the break- down: \u2014A total of $79 million for State-owned colleges and Indiana University\u2014a $22.8 million increase (37 percent) over 1968-69. Student population in these schools, that educate half of Pennsyl- vania's teachers, has increased by more than 10,000 in two years and it has nearly doubled in the past six years. \u2014A total of $154.2 million for the Universities of Pittsburgh, Temple and Penn State for the education of 87,292 undergraduate and graduate students in 1969-70. This is an increase of $29.6 million over 1968-69. \u2014A total of $63 million for State scholarship and loan assistance for approximately 163,000 students who need help\u2014an increase of approximately $12 million over 1968-69. \u2014A total of $32 million for non-state related colleges and uni- versities. The Administration proposes to phase out this assistance over the next five years in favor of a program to encourage private universities to develop effective graduate education programs that lead to doctoral degrees. \u2014A total of $15 million for a new program recommended by the Priorities Commission to increase our support for graduate edu- cation in an effort to increase the brainpower of Pennsylania. We are not producing the number of graduate degrees we should to at- tract and retain industry. \u2014A total of $18.6 million for Community Colleges where 33,500, students will be enrolled in 1969-70\u2014an increase of approximately $4 million over this year. This is for the 12 colleges now in operation and the start-up costs of five more. HUMAN SERVICES The greatest single need of people in the Commonwealth other than education is that of health and assistance to live in minimum decency. The recommendations are: \u2014Increase grants from 90 percent at present to 100 percent of the minimum standard of living for health and decency effective July 1, 1969.

Both of these improvements were recommended by the Priorities Commission. The needs of the mentally ill and mentally retarded continue to be a matter of concern and commitment.

This is included in the over-all increase of $31.8 million over the 1968-69 total of $144 million. \u2014$17 million provided for the establishment of community cen- ters for the mentally ill and mentally retarded. The advantages of non-institutionalized care and the development of comprehensive mental health services for early treatment and rehabilitation of the mentally disabled are evident in the continuing downward trend of patients residing in State mental hospitals. The development of com- prehensive mental health and mental retardation services at the community level is one of the major achievements of this Adminis- tration. 25 II II II II II II II II II II $50 45 COMPARISON OF PENNSYLVANIA CRIME RATE TO NATIONAL CRIME RATE population 600 700 800 900 1000 1100 1200 1300 1400 1500 1600 1700 1800 1900 2000 ..;;'cat 700.4 iiiii a UM 116 111. a INIO S MID SS S =SS MD a a I Budget Message The medical assistance program which has been in effect since January 1, 1966, provides all eligible persons under age 65 with physicians' services, in-patient and post-hospital care, clinic services and various other nursing care services. Similar services are pro- vided for persons over age 65 for whom such care is not already furnished under Medicare. Approximately one million persons will receive one or more medical services during 1969-70. \u2014$70 million has been provided for medical assistance, an in- crease of $2.2 million over the $67.9 million provided in 1968-69. By the provision of these funds Pennsylvania will be able to continue the Nation's first State-operated medical assistance program. \u2014$15.7 million is included to enable the counties -to provide needed services to an estimated 75 thousand children. Some 40 thousand require services in their own homes, 26.5 thousand receive foster family care and the balance institutional or other care arrange- ments. The State supports these county programs by bearing 35 per- cent of the cost. ENVIRONMENT Because of the critical importance of planning in the solution of the complex problems of our society an Advisory Council for Comprehensive Health Planning was formed late in 1968. This Council composed of 25 prominent Pennsylvanians was instructed to review policies and procedures for establishing and developing a comprehensive State health plan and State-wide planning mechanism. From their recommendations, the budget includes: \u2014$53.4 million for Health appropriations, an increase of $7.8 million over 1968-69 amounts available. \u2014$4.6 million of this increase reflects the Priorities Commission recommendation to be distributed as follows: $1.8 million Environ- mental Health; $1.8 million Housing Hygiene; $1.0 million Physical Health. The problems of our environment which have been aggravated by population growth, expanding industrialization and absence of adequate planning have made it mandatory that we act now. It was for this reason that legislation was enacted in 1968 making Penn- sylvania the first State in the Nation to establish an extensive air sampling network aimed at reducing pollution. A toughened enforce- ment of regulations limiting emission of atmospheric pollutants is a first step in this program and funds have been provided for this purpose. In cooperation with local governments the 10 million tons of solid waste. produced each year will become a manageable conserva- tion problem. Public health hazards, enviornmental pollution and its associated human misery and economic loss have long been neglected and we intend to budget sufficient funds to cope with this problem in cooperation with local agencies of government. One of the Commonwealth's most neglected environmental and social problems is substandard housing. Over 800,000 houses in Pennsylvania are in deteriorated or di- lapidated condition. Two-thirds of our population is not protected 27 II II II II II II II II 11 II Ii Budget Message by any housing code. Only 1 in 8 of our communities have housing codes. The State, in cooperation with local government, should begin now to intensify its program of assistance to upgrade housing quality. (a) Submission to the Legislature of a mandatory State-wide Housing Code. (b) Develop inspection staff to implement new housing stand- ards. There is a need to expand housing hygiene inspection programs by recruiting and training personnel, including residents of ghetto areas. This program would include creating housing quality survey teams whose objective would be to survey 10,000 homes. (c) Promote householder training project for large urban areas as an adjunct to code enforcement. A strong program of tenant edu- cation should be initiated. This program would provide instruction to tenants of marginal housing units to enable them to perform minor repair and maintenance projects to prevent further deterioration. \u2014$7 million for the Department of Mines and Mineral Industries in mining area restoration work to help assure Pennsylvania of clean streams and decent water. \u2014$9.1 million for the Department of Agriculture up from the $7 million of 1968-69 to insure an adequate supply of food and fiber for the expanded population of the future. PROTECTION OF PERSONS AND PROPERTY \u2014$843 thousand for the meat and poultry inspection law. This law and activity will provide a broad base upon which to build con- sumer confidence in the wholesomeness of meat and poultry processed in Pennsylvania. \u2014$517 thousand for the Consumer Protection Bureau of the De- partment of Justice. This is protection of the consumer against the fraud and deceit of a few unscrupulous persons who prey on the in- nocence of the elderly, poor and the uneducated. \u2014$29.3 million to carry out these responsibilities, an increase over 1968-69 of $4.7 million. \u2014$24.3 million of the $29.3 million budget for the operation of correctional institutions which involves about 2,200 of the total of 2,600 Justice Department employes. \u2014$601 thousand for criminal justice, including the permanent Pennsylvania Crime Commission. Under laws enacted in 1968, the Commission has full subpoena powers to investigate organized crime, to inquire into its causes and to find measures for their prevention. Un- der this Commission law enforcement and the administration of justice will be significantly aided. INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT The record of outstanding performance in the creation of new jobs and record low rates of unemployment coupled with a 6.3 percent increase in per capita income support, testify to the success of what we have had in industrial development. \u2014$51.6 million to continue and expand programs previously im- plemented. \u2014$21.4 million of the increase in funds is for the Pennsylvania Industrial Development Act, bringing this program to a level of $40.0 1 28 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 IIIIIIIIiIIIM1h111111 1111111 MIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII IFIMO (Estimated) Budget Message PENNSYLVANIA INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY (Based on Plant Construction for Manufacturing, Utilities, Transportation, and Distribution Terminals) 1963 through 1968 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 4,500 5,000 NUMBER OF NEW AND EXPANDED INDUSTRIAL PLANTS (Cumulative) Source: Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industrial Development, Research Division, million for 1969-70. \u2014$.9 million increase in Site Development funds. \u2014$3 million increase in Science and Engineering Foundation grants. \u2014$1.2 million for Pennsylvania's Bicentennial Commission. \u2014$.3 million for Keystone Corridor. All these amounts the Priorities Commission felt were extremely vital investments in Pennsylvania's economic future. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT The single most compelling problem we face continues to be the urban communities. Solutions are not quick or easy and the measure of progress in the long view will be the true measure of success. \u2014$68.5 million for programs designed for progress in this area. \u2014$13 million for improvements in housing and shelter require- ments. This program would provide loans to local nonprofit groups sponsoring projects for either the rehabilitation of existing structures to provide opportunities for home ownership or new construction of rental units where appropriate. \u2014$2 million for the Capital Reserve necessary for the operation of the Pennsylvania Housing Agency.

HIGHWAYS For the first time this year we have included in the Governor's Executive Budget the budget amounts for the Motor License Fund. This is a reflection of the decision to make this message a comprehen- sive review of all of our fiscal resources and requirements. \u2014$1.006 billion is the recommended amount, an increase of $173 million over the estimated expenditures of $833 million. This recommendation is indicative of our determination to con- tinue our aggressive highway building program which is second to no other state. The 27 percent increase in construction contracts awarded last year coupled with a leap of $133 million in the value of work begun last year (total $416 million) are indicators of the direc- tion that we are moving in this urgent undertaking. The single most important program which must be pressed is the local roads improvement plan which has as its goal the elimination of traffic hazards. The State Highway Department has identified al- most 1,300 locations where road hazards must be removed: This will involve new construction of more than 434 miles of highway. \u2014$12.3 million for capital outlays, doWn $1.3 million. The re- quest for the budget year reflects this step of the five-year building expansion plan, expected to be completed in 1972. Replacement of equipment both for wear and tear and technological change is in- cluded in the budget amount. 31 II II II II II LI II It II II II Budget Message \u2014$3.5 million increase has been projected for Debt Service re- quirements. These payments are made to the State Highway and Bridge Authority and in the budget year it is estimated that they will amount to slightly over $30 million. \u2014$6.4 million, a 20 percent increase, has been recommended in funds for planning, research and testing of materials, quality control, and need analysis. Studies are under way in 11 cities and regional planning of trans- portation continues to receive significant attention. \u2014$51.8 million for the engineering staff. An increase of 221 positions to a total of 2,843 persons has been planned in order to ac- commodate the design of a safe and efficient highway system. Costly consultant services for this function will be avoided and the request should provide a more flexible force. \u2014$580 million of construction work in the budget year will in- volve over 4,800 employes. \u2014$123 million of this amount will be State funds, $266 million Federal funds and $191 million State Highway and Bridge Authority. \u2014$125 million for Highway maintenance, an increase of almost $8 million, COMPARISON OF AVERAGE EARNINGS OF PRODUCTION WORKERS IN MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES IN PENNSYLVANIA TO NATIONAL AVERAGE 1958 to 1967 I I I . s .

These funds must also support increases in other high- way-related activities, particularly the traffic function of the State Police. Total yield from present revenue sources is projected to be $424,- 300,000 during the budget year. The principal sources of State funds for highway purposes are the Liquid Fuels Tax on gasoline and from passenger and commercial vehicle registration fees. The receipts from the gasoline tax are ex- pected to increase by approximately 4 percent reflecting increased usage of street and road systems for both business and pleasure driv- ing. The increasing number of vehicle operators, automobiles and trucks on the highways results in an expansion of license fee collec- tions by about 31/2 percent. Other Commonwealth revenues in the Motor License Fund show minor variations from 1968-69 to 1969-70 estimates. \u2014$314 million, up $30.6 million from 1968-69, will be received from Washington for our highway efforts. It is anticipated that the Federal Government will continue to assist us in our road-building projects in much the same proportions as it has in the past. Even after considering this expansion of State and Federal reve- nues, it is necessary to take two additional actions to finance the highway program for 1969-70. \u2014$191 million in bonds issued to help pay for the road improve-- ments to be made. This amount is an increase of $63.5 million over the amount of construction provided by the State Highway and Bridge Authority during 1968-69. \u2014$67.5 million must be borrowed to purchase highway rights-of- way. The second action which must be taken is to increase the amount of revenue coming from State sources in order to meet our needs. \u2014$62.8 million from recommended increases in revenue in the Motor License Fund in line with the recommendations of the State Highway Commission.

Planning-Programming- Budgeting System 1969-70 Budget by Commonwealth Programs As part of the Planning-Programming-Budgeting System (PPBS) now being developed for the Commonwealth, eight broad Commonwealth Pro- grams have been formulated as a general framework upon which to organize the PPB System. The Commonwealth Programs represent the broadest grouping of the activities of the entire Commonwealth. Through their use, the PPB System can relate the activities of the several departments and agencies to each other and to the overall policies established by the Legis- lature and the Governor. The Commonwealth Programs are described below. They represent an initial formulation and are in the process of being refined as the activities are developed into detailed program structures for the major operating de- partments. The table which follows distributes .the General and Special Funds budget for 1969-70 for each agency into the eight Commonwealth Programs. At the present time, no attempt was made to distribute individual accounting classifications into more than one Commonwealth Program. I. General Administration and Support To provide an effective administrative system through which the major goals and objectives of the Commonwealth can be achieved. It should be recognized that the above does not represent the desire to achieve a substantive end. Agencies falling within this area are those involved with providing better and more responsive services to the substantive areas. The work of the Treasury Department, Governor's Office of Administra- tion, Department of Revenue, Auditor General, Civil Service Commission and the Department of Property and Supplies are largely attributable to this program. In addition, there are various boards and commissions whose func- tions are attributable to this program. The Department of State also has several administrative functions which are included. II. Protection of Persons and Property To provide an environment and social system in which the lives of individuals, and the property of individuals and organizations are pro- tected from natural and man-made disasters, and from illegal and unfair action. The program area of Protection of Persons and Property deals with the Following broad substantive areas: consumer protection, certain regulatory activities, law enforcement and mitigation of the effects of disasters. Within these broad areas, the Pennsylvania State Police, the Department of Banking, the Department of Justice, the Public Utility Commission, the Department of Military Affairs, the State Council of Civil Defense, and the Insurance Department deal almost entirely with the Protection of Persons and Property. Other agencies such as the Department of Forest and Waters, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Mines and Mineral In- dustries, and the Department of State are more diversified and some of their activities are included in other Commonwealth programs. III. Health\u2014Physical and Mental To provide an environment in which hazards to physical and mental health are minimized; to provide means for.the prevention of physical and mental disabilities; and to support a system of health care which will assure the availability of health services to those in need of them. 89 II II II e II II 11 e II II P.P.B.S. The Department of Health and the Department of Public Welfare are the primary contributors to the Commonwealth system of health. Several other agencies participate in the provision of health services to the citizens of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Department of Agriculture inspects meat and poultry in order to assure quality, the Department of Revenue makes institutional collections, the Department of Property and Supplies manages government donated foods, and the Department of Military Affairs operates a Soldiers and Sailors home at Erie. In addition, the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin and the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission work to provide a safe water supply. IV Intellectual Development and Education To provide a system of learning experiences and opportunities that will permit each individual to achieve his maximum potential intellectual development. The major contributions to this category come from the Department of Public Instruction which provides financial and supportive services for the maintenance and improvement of the education offered in public and private schools in the Commonwealth. The State Tax Equalization Board assists the Department of Public Instruction in determining the distribution of financial aid to school districts, and the proposed Pennsylvania Educational Study will examine the administrative efficiency in the education system. The Pennsylvania Public Television Network develops cultural and educational programs for broadcast to the public over a network of educational television stations. In addition to these educational activities, the Department of Military Affairs offers financial aid to the children of disabled veterans who want to continue their education beyond high school and subsidizes instructional programs in the Civil Air Patrol. V. Social Development To provide a system of services for reinforcing the capacity of in- dividuals, children and families for effective adjustment to society and for minimizing socially aberrant behavior. Within this Commonwealth Category the Department of Public Welfare provides a broad range of services designed to promote and strengthen family life, to promote the rehabilitation of those persons with social disabilities as well as to protect those who, because of age, mental or physical condition can not act effectively for themselves. One hundred per cent of the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole in providing services for the social integration of the offender is charged to this category. In addition the Human Relations Commission within the Governor's Office acts to protect civil rights. VI. Economic Development To provide a system in which the employment opportunities of in- dividuals, the economic growth and development of communities and the overall economic development of the Commonwealth will be maxi- mized (including optimum use of natural resources to support economic development.) There are twenty-three separate agencies, departments, commissions, and boards which contribute to the economic development of the Common- wealth and its citizens. The departments which have the largest participation in economic development are Agriculture, Commerce, Community Affairs, and Labor and Industry. In addition numerous agencies act in the areas of development of natural resources, regulation of economic activity and sup- port of public assistance programs. VII. Transportation and Communication To provide a system for the fast, efficient, and safe movement of in- dividuals, cargo, and information within the Commonwealth which is interfaced with a national\u2014international system of transportation and communication. 90 III f.P.B.S. Transportation and Communication systems are developed to serve the needs of citizens, commerce, industry, and larger systems that serve the state. The Department of Highways is the major contributor with 100% of its expenditures allocated to this category. In addition to highway improvements the Commonwealth deals with rail transportation through the Department of Community Affairs and Department of Commerce, mass transit projects in the Department of Community Affairs, and port development through the Department of ForeSt and Waters and the Department of Commerce. Rail transport and mass transit lirojects are financed almost entirely through local transportation authorities in cooperation with federal and local agencies. VIII. Recreation and Cultural Enrichment To provide a system of services and support functions to make avail- able opportunities for individual and group recreation and cultural growth. In working towards this broad Commonwealth goal, the major partici- pating agencies are the Fish Commission, Game Commission, Historical and Museum Commission, State Horse Racing Commission, as well as the Brandy- wine Battlefield Park Commission. One hundred per cent of these commis- sions is charged to this Commonwealth category. In addition the Department of Public Instruction provides library services; the Department of Forest and Waters undertakes a variety of activities in the development and pro- vision of recreational opportunities, and the Department of Community Af- fairs provides financial assistance to local government for the development of recreational opportunities.

Appropriations to the Treasury Department are requested in the General, Motor License, Fish and Game Fund budgets to meet these re- quirements. Differences between the appropriations requested and the Sink- ing Fund Requirements are made up by interest earned on securities. Public Buildings Construction Bonds (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) Principal Interest Total October 1, 1969 $ 2,000 $ 110 $ 2,110 April I, 1970 97 97 Total $ 2,000 $ 207 $ 2,207 Korean Conflict -Veterans' Compensation Bonds August 1, 1969 $ 8,600 $ 1,116 $ 9,716 February 1, 1970 976 976 Total $ 8,600 $ 2,092 $10,692 Project 70 Land Acquisition Bonds July 15, 1969 $ 410 $ 410 January 15 1970 410 410 September 15, 1969 383 383 March 15, 1970 383 383 Total .. $ 1,586 $ 1,586 Capital Facilities Bonds July 15, 1969 $ 1,000 $ 3,067 $ 4,067 January 15, 1970 2,015 2,015 Total $ 1,000 $ 5,082 $ 6,082 Total Requirements $11,600 $ 8,967 $20,567 In addition to these requirements, authority rentals in the following amounts will be required for 1969-70: General State Authority Rentals General Fund $61,380,000 Special Funds 1,673,000 State Highway and Bridge Authority Rentals 30,000,000 In past years the Commonwealth has issued bonds in special instances when specific Constitutional amendments were approved by the Legislature and the public which were .exempt from the $1,000,000 Constitutional debt limit. Among these issues were Public Buildings Construction, Korean Conflict Veterans Compensation, Project 70, Land and Water Development and World War II Veterans' Bonus which was recently completely retired. A Vietnam Veterans' Bonus has been authorized in a similar manner and $28 million in bonds for this purpose will be issued before the close of the 1968-69 fiscal year. In accordance with a Constitutional Amendment submitted by the Con- stitutional Convention of 1967-68 and approved by public referendum in 1968, the Commonwealth's Constitutional debt limit for capital projects is now in- creased. Bonds may be issued for capital projects without public approval, however, the total outstanding issues cannot exceed one and three quarters times the average of the annual tax revenues of the five preceding years. It was under this authorization that $88.5 million in bonds were issued in October, 1968. As a result of this amendment, financing of future building and highway construction may be effected through General Obligation bonds rather than through the General State Authority and the State Highway and Bridge 95 e II Ii ci ci III F1 ci II II II II It ci II ci Public Debt Authority. Funds required for transportation assistance can be acquired in this method also. For projection purposes, it has been estimated that from $400 million to $500 million in bond issues will be required each year for the next four years. These funds will be used for capital construction, high- way construction, transportation assistance, original capital equipment and certain community college projects. Debt service requirements for these issues will climb to $120 million by 1973-74. Since these estimates of bond requirements were made before the Capital Budget was finalized, there may be some variation between the anticipated issues and the value of projects recommended. Bonds will only be issued as required by project expendi- tures. Authority Rentals will continue on all projects financed with authority- issued bonds. The amount of these rentals will depend upon the number of projects under lease agreement between the authorities and the Common- wealth. A projection of the Commonwealth's debt limit and outstanding debt which pertains to the limit is as follows: PROJECTION OF DEBT LIMIT (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) Average Tax Revenues Debt Outstanding Available Previous 5 Years* Limit Debt Debt June 30, 1968 $1,915,400 June *Revenue projections are based on a 7 per cent expected annual increase. This figure is based on the average rate of increase for the previous four years, during which new taxes were introduced. The estimate thus assumes a tax increase of approximately the same level previously levied, plus normal revenue increases. 96 VOLUME II GENERAL FUN TABLE OF CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND SUMMARIES General Fund Financial Statement 1 Summary by Department, State Funds Only 3 Summary by Character, State Funds Only 4 Summary of Subsidies, State Funds Only 5 6 Reconcilation of 1968-69 and 1969-70 Budgets 7 Mandated Programs 8 New Programs 9 Expanded Programs 14 Normal Increases 18 Complement Increase 1969-70, General Fund Budget .... 19 Facts Supporting a State Employe Pay Increase 21 APPROPRIATIONS Governor's Office 23 Lieutenant Governor 29 Auditor General 31 Treasury Department 34 Agriculture, Department of 38 Banking (Pennsylvania Securities Commission), Department of 49 Civil Defense, Council of 52 Civil Service Commission 55 Commerce, Department of 58 Community Affairs, Department of 68 Forests and Waters, Department of 78 Health, Department of 85 Historical and Museum Commission 99 Insurance Department 103 Justice, Department of 108 Labor and Industry, Department of 118 Military Affairs, Department of 125 Milk Marketing Board 132 Mines and Mineral Industries, Department of 134 Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole 142 Property and Supplies, Department of 146 Public Instruction, Department of 154 Public Utility Commission 188 Public Welfare, Department of 191 Revenue, Department of 219 State, Department of _ 224 State Police _ 231 Tax Equalization Board 238 Administrative Miscellaneous and Commissions 240 Legislature 247 Judiciary 252 Employe Pay Increase 258 REVENUES General Fund Revenues 259 Summary of General Funds Estimated Revenues 260 Schedule of Adjustments to Estimated Revenue, 1968-69 Fiscal year _ ... _ 261 General Fund Revenue Sources 262 General Fund Revenue Detail 279 II II ii ii ii ii ansinalIOSSINIMMOSSSIIISIOSOIN Stid. 1k e ts ii a General Fund FINANCIAL STATEMENT (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 SURPLUS, BEGINNING OF YEAR $ 68,444 7( Current Lapses \u201441,417 ESTIMATED EXPENDITURES \u20141,977,996 \u20142,521,836 ENDING SURPLUS ..... $ 28,943 ADDITIONAL REVENUE NEEDED $ 492,593 3 it II LI II 11 II II *Includes $10,000,000 for Basic Instruction subsidy; $560,000 for Education of Deaf, Blind and Cerebral Palsied subsidy; $175,000 for Educational Radio and Television subsidy; $380,000 for annuitants Medical and Hospital Insurance costs; $364,000 for Judiciary expenses; $150,000 for Milk Marketing Board Expenses, and $50,000 for Community Affairs subsidies.

There is little choice or discretion possible with this type of ex- penditure. Funds to implement the laws must be included in the Budget and have been determined by estimating the total number of people served or the demand expected or anticipated. Where legislation has indicated that such expenditures should be made and all that is required is a resolution of both Houses of the Legislature (for example, Act No. 96, the Basic Edu- cation Subsidy), we have treated this as mandated. New Programs This classification is set up to indicate .the total amounts for programs that are discretionary. Legislation does not exist for theirS implementation but it must be introduced. Some of these new programs have been recom- mended by the Priorities Commission. This designation is not all inclusive, since some new programs have been designated as Mandated. Expanded Programs This classification is intended to show that a program presently exists in law and in departments' operations, but the amount previously provided for the program or the percentage reimbursement for the group served by the program is going to be expanded and such .expansion will require increased funds. An increase in the allowances paid for Public Assistance would be an example of an expanded program. ,Normal Increases . . Normal increases result from inflationary pressures, increased numbers of people presently served (such as school population), increased demand for programs that are unchanged in any way, 'wage increases that are the result of increments attained by individuals that are moving through their grade or classification. There is little that can be done to control this type of an increase, but the magnitude of the increase must be known and understood in order to properly understand the total budget increase. It is also intended to embrace any other increases not covered under the Mandated, New or Expanded programs. 6 I.

The Commonwealth has failed to keep pace with the competing salaries of public jurisdictions and private employers, as well as the steeply rising cost-of-living. Since Pennsylvania's last general pay increase on January 1, 1967, six other industrial states and the Federal Government, have effected across- the-board pay increases. Of special significance is the 8 per cent general increase granted to Philadelphia city employes in January, 1968, and an additional 12 per cent scheduled to be effective in January or July of 1969. In recent years, the Commonwealth has had more difficulty recruiting and retraining employes in the Philadelphia area than in any other section of the state. Between January, 1967 and November, 1968, the national consumer price index rose by more than 7 per cent. If current trends continue, the average cost-of-living in the United States will have increased by nearly 10 per cent between January, 1967 and July, 1969. In terms of average salary of Commonwealth employes, Pennsylvania ranked 20th when compared to the other states in 1956; in 1967 we slipped to a ranking of 31st. Among the seven public jurisdictions mentioned above, Pennsylvania ranked 5th in average salary in 1956; in 1967, Pennsylvania ranked last. Pennsylvania salary ranges are now too low to effectively compete for new employes, but more serious, perhaps, is the possibility that our proven employes may leave state service because of their comparatively low salaries.

He maintains the Governor's Residence, entertains official guests and participates in the annual Governors' Conference. This program also maintains the office of the Special Representative of the Governor in Washington, D. C. The Governor guides the direction of agency programs to ensure com- pliance with existing legislation, definable needs and Administration goals and evaluates State government program services and spending. The Governor coordinates all State participation in Federal programs by developing more efficient administrative methods and policies; periodically reviewing and evaluating programs; issuing status reports; and proposing new Federal legislation to meet Pennsylvania's requirements.

The program directs the Governor's budget and supervises its execution by overseeing agency budgeting and spending in ac- cordance with Administration objectives and legislative mandates. It also guides the development and use of the State's capital structures arid co- ordinates all capital improvement planning. The objectives of the major administrative staff divisions are: To main- tain an accurate and complete record of the Commonwealth's finances through the application of modern accounting methods; to effect modern management methods and implement management improvement programs in the various agencies; and to apply sound policies and practices of personnel management throughout the State government. Among the program activities receiving primary emphasis are the following: Administration of the classification and compensation plans of the Commonwealth in conjunction with the Civil Service Commission; the review of all legislative bills for fiscal and program implications; direction of the Governor's Cost Reduction Program which is aimed at efficient and economical state government; and the coordination and review of all activities involved in planning EDP systems and in the selection and utilization of EDP equipment. The implementation of a Planning-Programming-Budgeting System for the Commonwealth will require an increase in funds within the Governor's Office during 1969-70. It will be necessary to increase staff capability and to undertake special projects to insure its success. When operational, the sys- tem will provide both the Governor and the Legislature with a more rational and informative basis for making program decisions and for allocating Com- monwealth funds where they can be most effective.

The Department's programs are financed from the General Fund and from augmentations received from the Federal Government, milk inspection fees and certain feed, fertilizer, lime and pesticide licenses, fees and fines. GENERAL GOVERNMENT Executive and Administrative (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Total $ 852 Complement 94 $ 424 $1,276 7 101 Through the offices of the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Public Informa- tion, Comptroller and Administrative Services, this program directs the de- velopment and implementation of agricultural programs; provides adminis- trative control over regional offices; performs staff and management services including fiscal, personnel, administrative, management methods and pro- curement; develops and carries out a department wide public information program; performs accounting and fiscal reporting services. Due to a lack of sufficient employment opportunities, educational facil- ities and medical, fire and law enforcement services, there has been a con- tinued movement of people from rural to urban areas. This migration has had a serious impact on the rural economy and particularly farming\u2014a bil- lion dollar industry in Pennsylvania. To combat these problems and re- vitalize the Commonwealth's rural areas a two-part Rural Development Program is proposed. A total of $100,000 is recommended for the first part, rural planning and development. This program would identify the needs of the rural com- munity, determine the resources available to meet the needs, plan and de- velop alternative courses of action, monitor and evaluate the implementation of programs, and prepare recommendations for program improvements to achieve maximum effectiveness. For the second part, an agricultural research program, $200,000 is recom- mended. The objectives of this program would be to improve the quality of agricultural products and increase per acre yields, to improve processing and packaging techniques, to improve methods for preserving and distribut- 1 40 Agriculture ing food products and to find additional and better ways for marketing Pennsylvania agricultural products. The Department is in the process of developing and installing a ;manage- ment information system which will expedite the issuance of licenses and the collection and dissemination of agricultural data used by the Department, its regional offices, farmers and other interested parties. The recommended budget includes $40,042 for the acquisition of electronic data processing equipment and four operators. Animal Industry (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 State Funds Complement .. Estimated Expend. $1,931 Increase Decrease $ 128 Budget $2,059 179 179 The objective of this program is the prevention, control and eradication bf transmissible diseases of domestic animals and poultry. To meet its responsibilities, the program maintains one central and five regional laboratories to diagnose poultry and livestock diseases; tests all cattle for tuberculosis; tests for brucellosis by administering quarterly milk ring tests; administers blood tests every three years to all herds not listed on milk ring tests projects; conducts a brucellosis vaccination program for bovine calves; arranges tests for miscellaneous diseases by veterinarians and Department pathologists. The program activities also include licensing and inspection of all slaughtering establishments and livestock auction markets; training and licensing of technicians to supplement veterinary services for the control of poultry disease; licensing and bi-monthly inspection of garbage feed plants; regulation of the reporting and quarantining of animals, and administration of the Animal Industry Program described under Grants and Subsidies. All disease control and eradication programs are conducted in coopera- tion with the U. S. Department of Agriculture. National goals have been established for the eradication of hog cholera by 1972 and brucellosis by 1975. If progress achieved to date in controlling these diseases is maintained, it should enable the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture to meet these national goals ahead of schedule. The Bureau of Animal Industry which administers this program also administers the Meat and Poultry Inspection Program described below. Present program resources are adequate for the existing program. The budget provides for continuation of the program at the current level.

To protect Pennsylvania consumers against adulterated, misbranded, harmful, or unwholesome food, the program responsibilities include analyz- ing food samples, inspection of food processing and handling establishments 41 Agriculture and, where warranted, institution of prosecution proceedings against violators. The program inspects and supervises the operation of dairy Plants and farm facilities used in the production of milk. It also inspects laboratories engaged in the bacteriological examination of milk and milk products. In order to maintain standards of quality and to prevent deception or fraud, the program collects, analyzes and publishes annual reports concern- ing feed, fertilizer, lime and pesticide products. A laboratory is maintained in Harrisburg. Samples are also analyzed at Penn State University, and by local chemists paid on a fee basis. Due to a constant increase in the number of food handling and process- ing establishments and the introduction of many new food additives, an addi- tional seven food inspectors costing $24,292 are recommended to permit additional, more frequent and more comprehensive food inspections and in- vestigations. Marketing Activities (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Increase Expend. Decrease Budget State Funds $ 679 $ 682 $1,361 Complement 67 8 75 The objectives of this program are to assist Pennsylvania farmers and processors in finding new markets for their agricultural products, to improve marketing practices, and to insure consumers that certain commodities com- ply with quality and grade standards. In cooperation with the U. S. Department of Agriculture, the program collects and disseminates statistical and other reports on prices, grades, and availability of poultry, eggs, fruits, vegetables, livestock and other farm and food products. They also assist farmers, processors and distributors in im- proving organized commodity marketing systems, marketing practices, and sales. Efforts to expand the demand for Pennsylvania eggs and chickens include establishment of a uniform egg grading program, licensing egg graders and inspection of liquid and frozen egg processing plants. Hatcheries and pack- ing plants are inspected for poultry disease and air sanitation. Retail outlets are inspected to determine the quality and freshness of eggs. At the new Egg Test Center near Penn State University, an annual Pennsylvania Random Sample Egg Laying Test involving some 4,600 chickens is conducted to study egg production in relation to feed consumption, and to measure economic factors used in judging the merits of different strains and breeds of chickens. The Bureau also establishes official grade standards for fresh fruits and vegetables so that product quality may be identified and market value established. Inspection and certification services are made available to fruit and vegetable processors, to shipping facilities, and to retail stores to prevent misgrading and to meet the requirements of intrastate, interstate and foreign commerce. To strengthen the effectiveness of individual commodity development programs, $500,000 is recommended for a broad advertising and promotional program to sell throughout the Nation the importance and excellence of Pennsylvania as a source of quality agricultural products. It is expected that the program activities would include advertising in key trade publica- tions, exhibits and demonstrations at national meetings of food industry associations, distribution of brochures and literature describing the quality and variety of Pennsylvania agricultural products, and an annual Food Marketing Seminar to bring together all elements of the marketing system\u2014 producers, processors, shippers, wholesalers, retailers; etc.\u2014for the purpose of 1 42 Budget $ 537 II (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Expend.

To help increase the sale of Pennsylvania products, $44,000 is budgeted for the establishment of an Information Exchange Center which would collect and classify information regarding availability, price, quantity, grade and quality of agricultural products. It would also seek potential sales out- lets within the State, throughout the United Sates and in foreign countries. Plant Industry (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Expend. State Funds $664 Federal Funds 13 Increase Decrease $ 81 Budget $745 13 Total $677 $ 81 $758 Complement 38 38 The objectives of the plant industry program are to conserve and protect plant life from insects and diseases and to protect the consumer by assuring him of quality nursery and seed products. To detect and control plant pests and diseases the program, in cooperation with the Federal Government, annually conducts aerial and ground inspec- tions to determine the locations and extent of various pests and diseases in- cluding the Gypsy Moth, the European Chafer, the Cereal Leaf Beetle and Oak Wilt disease. Based on the results of the surveys, appropriate control measures are applied to infested areas to control or eradicate the insect or disease involved. On occasion, plant pest control quarantines, orders or regulations are established and enforced. The program maintains a modern laboratory at its Harrisburg head- quarters. Tests are conducted on seeds submitted by farmers, seedmen or other individuals to determine purity, noxious weed content and length of germination periods. Inspectors collect samples of agricultural, vegetable, flower, tree and shrub seeds offered for sale in Pennsylvania which are analyzed to insure conformity with brand claims and legal requirements. The budget provides for continuance of this program at the current level. II II Soil and Water Conservation Complement 15 1 18 This program protects and manages soil and water resources of the Commonwealth. The State Soil and Water Conservation Commission provides both finan- cial assistance and technical advice to the State's county soil and water conservation commissions. Areas of concern include conservation of soil and water resources, con- trol and prevention of soil erosion, flood control, maintenance of reservoirs to safeguard and conserve local water supplies, community drainage projects and protection of dams. The State Commission approves county soil and water conservation project plans, apportions funds allocated from State or Federal sources and takes responsibility for expenditures by county districts. Certain expenses of the non-salaried district directors are borne by the State. III ID fill fill 43 Agriculture A county by county soil survey program is jointly supported by the following agencies and institutions: the U. S. Soil Conservation Service which performs field surveys and writes initial reports; the Agricultural Experiment Station at Penn State University which provides laboratory and field char- acterization testing services; Agricultural Extension Service, Penn State University, which provides information on results of the surveys to the public; the State Soil and Water Conservation Commission which provides coordination, financial support and technical assistance. A sedimentation and erosion control study is conducted with The United States Geologic Survey to (1) develop sediment and erosion control measures that are effective and practical in connection with highway construction and (2) determine the contribution of agriculture as compared to urban areas in polluting streams and other bodies of water with pesticides. The State Soil and Water Conservation Commission also administers the Local Soil and Water District Assistance program and the Support of Small Watershed Projects program described under GRANTS and SUB- SIDIES. Weather irregularities, particularly dry spells, occurring in the south- central portion of the Commonwealth led to the creation in July 1968 of a Weather Modification Board. The Board is responsible for licensing and regulating individuals who conduct weather modification activities. To carry out its responsibilities, $47,404 is recommended to engage Pennsylvania State University to establish a radar surveillance station in the southcentral counties to determine the extent of and, if possible, identify any individuals who may be involved in weather modification activities.

The program is new and still in the process of development as a result of the Pennsylvania Meat and Poultry Hygiene Act of 1968 which mandates ante- and post-mortem inspection in nearly all meat and poultry establish- ments in the State. The Federal Government supports 50 per cent of the expenses of this program. Of the amount budgeted, $180,600 is provided for 50 new positions in- cluding 38 meat inspectors, 10 veterinarians and two support positions. This staff increase is required to fully inspect, in accordance with the mandatory provisions of the Meat and Poultry Hygiene Act, the over 900 establishments which presently exist. Dog Law Enforcement (Dollar Amounts In Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Expend. State Funds $609 Increase Decrease $151 Budget $760 Complement 73 73 1 44 Agriculture The objective of the Dog Law Enforcement Program is to ensure proper control and care of dogs. The Bureau licenses and inspects kennels and regu- lates the sale and transportation of dogs. Inspectors check to determine that sufficient amounts of light, air, food, water and space are provided and that runs and crates are cleaned periodically. Research centers and humane society kennels are also inspected. Municipal and animal protection agencies are reimbursed for the care and humane disposition of stray, unlicensed dogs seized while running at large. The Bureau investigates the theft and poisoning of dogs, and claims for damages caused by dogs to livestock, poultry and property. The program also administers the Reimbursement for Kennel Construc- tion subsidy and a portion of the Animal Industry program described under Grants and Subsidies. Due to an increasing awareness on the part of those agencies legally qualified to seek reimbursement for humanely holding and disposing of stray dogs, an increase of $75,000 is recommended to meet an anticipated 37,500 additional claims.

GRANTS AND SUBSIDIES Animal Industry To reduce the economic loss of owners, indemnity payments are made as compensation for diseased or exposed animals which are destroyed to prevent the spread of disease. Payments are also made to the owners of poultry, game birds and live- stock destroyed by dogs if restitution cannot be obtained from the identified dog owners. A slight decrease is recommended due to the effectiveness of the animal disease control and eradication programs.

The Commission also must determine the eligibility for exemption from registration of securities proposed to be issued in the Commonwealth. In order to carry out the objectives of this program it is vitally important to register all salesmen and companies dealing in securities. The Commission believes that the total number of dealers and salesmen registered on an an- nual basis accurately reflects the overall activity and effectiveness of this program. A summary of the total dealers and salesmen registered by the Commission during the past five years and an estimate for the next five years follows: Year Ending June 30 Total Year Ending June 30 Total 1964 7,769 1969 9,950 1965 7,927 1970 10,500 1966 8,289 1967 8,660 1972 11,500 1968 9,476 1973 12,100 The present program facilities, including those recommended for 1969- 70, will be capable of supporting the projected increase in registrations and other securities activities for the next several years with only minor in- creases in appropriations. 50 II Banking III Source of Funds (Dollar Amounts In Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 III Estimated Expend.

This includes the coordination of State, county and local activities associated with warning, communications, shelter, radi- ological defense, fire police, rescue, medical, welfare and other emergency services essential to the maximum practical degree of safety for all Penn- sylvanians. The agency budget includes no funds for emergency operations or disaster relief activities necessitated by natural disasters or other emergencies of major proportions. Federal and/or Commonwealth funds may be made available for such emergencies through special appropriative action, or by other means legally prescribed. When this is done, the funds \"flow through\" the agency, both to other Commonwealth departments and agencies and/or to political subdivisions of the State. The over-all objective of the agency program is the development of a basic, statewide emergency organization, including State, county and local units, to protect life and property in natural disasters; and to counter the numerous and complex problems of enemy attack. 53 lB II II II II II II II II II II II Civil Defense Program activities fall into two general classifications. One embraces those concerned with the mobilization and utilization of State emergency resources, including the maintenance of a Main Operations Center and three Area Emergency Operations Centers, operation of statewide warning, com- munications and radiation monitoring networks, and stockpiling emergency supplies. The second is the coordination of county and local plans and pro- grams in the mobilization and utilization of resources in emergencies. Assuming there will be no major and lasting increase in international tension and no threat of imminent attack\u2014it is believed that continuance of the current, basic civil defense program, without major modification or ex- pansion, will effectively protect life and property in emergencies. The recommended amount will carry present program forward in addi- tion to providing for a warehouse re-roofing project at the Edward Martin Military Reservation and for Federally-mandated modifications to the State's Civil Defense Communications Network.

The Department focuses mainly on attracting new industries to the State and expanding existing industries, developing an environment conducive to economic growth, developing the climate for the growth of existing business and industry, and promoting the Commonwealth as a na- tional and international vacationland. The departmental organization embraces four major program areas cen- tering on the four focal activities mentioned above. In addition the Depart- ment has two supportive elements that service the major programs.. The bulk of departmental activities are financed from General Fund appropria- tions. The exception is the Economic Opportunity program which has for the past three years received a 75 per cent cost reimbursement under Section 302 of the Federal Appalachia Act. Support under this provision is limited to a three year period, therefore the recommended budget includes 100 per cent State financing of the activity. The Department also administers a portion of the transportation program financed through principal and inter- est payments.

Complement The Bureau of Industrial Development aids and fosters the growth and expansion of existing industries, and acquaints out-of-state industry with Pennsylvania's advantages. The program had concentrated on alleviating chronic, critical unemployment in generally depressed areas. Recently it has focused on creating jobs in urban ghetto areas and on providing a diversi- fied economic foundation. The program includes two major activities. The Plant Location Unit staff of national salesmen solicits industrial prospects outside Pennsylvania, hosts prospective employers on Pennsylvania community inspection trips, resp.?.nds to inquiries resulting from advertising, and maintains liaison with the various Pennsylvania organizations whose principal concern is industrial development. The staff of the Research Unit concentrates on the problems of industrial marketing, engineering economics, plant location economics and area and regional studies. The staff provides prospect industries with special engineer- ing and economic data on plant location factors. Industrial opportunity studies in specific product and industry fields are developed along with in- formation on labor supply and wage ratio, production materials, and local and corporate taxation. The Industrial Development Bureau administers the Industrial Devel- opment Assistance and Loans programs discussed under Grants and Subsidies. Since Federal support will be discontinued, the increase in State funds for this program is necessary to maintain the present activity level.

Foremost among these is the Federal-State Appalachian Regional De- velopment program. While the Department of Commerce does not have line responsibility for executing the Appalachian developmental activities, the Secretary of Commerce, as alternate to the Governor as Pennsylvania's mem- ber on the Appalachian Commission, must review, coordinate, and sponsor all action programs proposed by other departments and agencies. To facilitate this administrative responsibility, and in conformance with Federal requirements, the bureau, assisted by the State Planning Board and the seven regional development districts is responsible for preparing an investment plan for the economic development of the Appalachian region of Pennsylvania.

Travel Development (Dollar Amounts In Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 State Funds ............ ......... Estimated Expend. Increase Decrease $ 434 Budget $1,597 Tourism, the second largest industry in the Commonwealth, earned a gross income of $3 billion in 1967. The Travel Development program seeks to increase the volume of tourists by advertising media, promotion, and as- sisting regional groups in developing tourist business. Promotional advertising, as authorized by the Commerce Law, is aimed toward the out-of-state traveler. The Department of Commerce through this bureau conducts an extensive advertising and publicity campaign in many metropolitan newspapers and national magazines. Publications such as \"Discover the New Pennsylvania\" have brought in a huge flood of tourist inquiries. The travel promotion program also includes the production of films for television and showings at expositions, conventions, and motion picture theaters. The Department's tourist inquiry section answers an estimated 350,000 inquiries for travel information annually. The bureau distributes over 3 million pieces of literature annually, much of which is furnished by com- munity organizations and trade organizations in the vacation and travel fields. Most recently, the Bureau has assisted in the promotion and develop- ment of Pennsylvania's growing ski industry and will continue to provide a telegraphic ski reporting service. The second major phase of the Department's travel promotion is focused on community organizations and associations. The bureau offers the services of its professional staff members to address meetings and encourage local participation in travel promotion. The amount recommended for Travel Development will allow the Depart- ment to extend its media advertising to the southern and midwestern states, reprint the major travel films, and to continue expansion of the tourist in- formation booth program at 3 additional sites on interstate highways. 61 Commerce Business Services (Dollar Amounts In Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 State Funds _ Complement Estimated Expend. $265 Increase Decrease $180 Budget $445 13 13 The objective of the Business Services program is the continued growth of Pennsylvania's economy through protection and promotion of business and industry. The Business Services program provides information to regional clinics, forums and workshops, and maintains close liaison with the U. S. Depart- ments of Commerce, State, Defense, and local chambers of commerce. The Bureau offers information on long and short term financing avail- able to all business, especially new and expanding business. Fiscal problems relating to small business are analyzed. The Bureau has no funds for direct loans to business; its function is to recommend sources in this category. The Bureau is undertaking the promotion of \"Business Development Credit Corporations.\" These corporations will complement other lending devices promoted by private and government lending facilities by making funds available for business enterprises unable to acquire the necessary funds to expand business or start a new venture. A Division of Federal Procurements within the Bureau establishes and maintains sources of information pertaining to the $50 billion annual Fed- eral procurement market. Through seminars, solicitations and interviews, the manufacturers not presently engaged in this field are being guided and encouraged to participate. A Foreign Trade and Port Development Division of the Bureau of Busi- ness Services is encouraging and instructing many segments of the business community to enter foreign trade, furthering the Department's goal of finding more jobs for more people and increasing the utilization of the port facilities. A number of major programs dedicated to improving the economic health of Pennsylvania are staffed by the Bureau of Business Services. Among these are the Governor's Science Advisory Committee, the Pennsylvania Science and Engineering Foundation, the Interdepartmental Clearing Council, and the Atomic Energy Advisory Committee. The increase recommended will provide for a substantial increase in foreign trade advertising and promotion and funds for research requested by the Atomic Energy Advisory Committee.

The funds granted are used for professional industrial location staff, advertising and promotion programs, and continuous location factor research. The program is necessary to meet the continuing need for additional employment oppor- tunities and to diversify the local industrial base to prevent over-dependence on single or extractive industries. The amount recommended for Industrial Development Assistance will permit continuation of the grant program at the present level of $ .05 1/2 per capita. PENNSYLVANIA INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY: Through the Industrial Development Loan program, PIDA assists industries or research and development firms planning to locate new facilities or expand existing facilities in Pennsylvania. Loans are made through local industrial groups for up to 40 per cent of the cost of site acquisition and facility con- struction. The original intent of the PIDA program was to assist in the economic regeneration of areas of chronic unemployment by providing jobs to offset the decrease in mining and railroad employment. While this is still a predominent consideration, the program is now attempting to provide for a diversified and stable economic base that will prevent a recurrence of widespread unemployment experienced during the 1950's. As a result of recent amendments to the PIDA law, the Board is now placing emphasis on the need to locate industries in center cities to alleviate minority unemploy- ment in our urban areas. The increase for PIDA is necessary to maintain the present level of plant location activity using this as the sole source of financing industrial development. It was anticipated in the 1967-68 and 1968-69 budgets that PIDA financing could be reduced through utilization of revenue bond financing. However, the Federal Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968 removed the tax exempt status from the bonds thus eliminating the al- ternate financing method. The recommended amount also includes funds for loans for agriculture and agribusiness. 3 63 Commerce Source of Funds (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Expend.

The grants are available for up to 50 per cent of the cost of extending municipal sewer and water lines or access roads to industrial sites or parks, or for diverting stream channels around industrial areas. In addition to site preparation, up to 25 per cent of the appropriation may be granted to industrial groups to assist in purchasing land for industrial location in ghetto areas. The amount of the 1068-69 Silo Development appropriation was exceeded by local grant requests. An increase of $875,000 is recommended to enable the Department to meet the increasing demands for these grants. TECHNICAL SERVICES: Funds appropriated for technical services are granted in total to The Pennsylvania State University to conduct infor- mation dissemination projects designed to transmit the latest scientific and technological findings to Pennsylvania industries. The program enables in- dustry to keep abreast of the latest advances quickly and easily and allows these findings to be incorporated in existing production methods. The amount recommended for Technical Services will provide for con- tinuation of the program at the present level. LOCAL DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT GRANTS: This grant program supports regional efforts in studying the potential of the area and developing plans to improve or correct environmental deficiencies that inhibit economic growth. The developmental planning performed by the seven regions is used by the Department and the State Planning Board in preparing the over- all \"plan for investment\" in the Appalachian region of Pennsylvania. The Federal Appalachia Regional Development Act requires a com- prehensive development plan as a prerequisite for receiving Appalachia funds. The recommended amount will continue support of local planning efforts at the present level. STATE'S PARTICIPATION\u2014APPALACHIAN ADMINISTRATION: To enable the Comomnwealth to take advantage of the Federal funds available for improving environmental and human resources under the Appalachian program, the State must contribute a pro rata share of the cost of the Com- mission and the Office of States' Representative. The cost of the Commission is shared between the Federal Government and the 13 participating states, The states' share, plus the cost of the States' Representative, is prorated between the states on the basis of 1/3 equal, 1/3 portion of total land area, and 1/3 portion of total population. 64 Commerce The amount provided for the State's contribution to the Appalachia Regional Commission enables the Commonwealth to receive Federal program support as shown on the chart included in the General Government, Economic Development program.

There are now 58 officially designated fully qualified Tourist Promotion Agencies serving 65 counties. Each made application for tourist promotion matching funds during the 1968-69 fiscal year. Originally, applicants received up to five cents per-capita. This past fiscal year the applicants received 6.3 cents per-capita or $4 per rentable room. The major portion of the matching funds is used by local agencies for advertising and promotion. With the elimination of billboards, publicity media has been reduced to radio, television, newspapers, magazines and brochures. The amount recommended for Tourist Promotion Assistance will allow an increase of approximately 31/2 cents per capita in the grants. The increase will allow the local agencies to perform a more comprehensive advertising and promotion campaign to increase tourism in the area. AMERICAN BICENTENNIAL: This program provides money for the Pennsylvania Bicentennial Commission and the Philadelphia Bicentennial Corporation to conduct planning studies to prepare for the American Bi- centennial Celebration in Philadelphia in 1976.

Grants are provided to various educational and research institutions to develop expertise in the fields of pollution control, materials, biomedicine and related disciplines, atomic energy, computer technology, oceanography, and transportation. The grants may take various forms including fellow- ships, 'grubstakes' for new professors, Governor's Chairs, and incentives for curriculum development. The Governor's Science Advisory Committee has illustrated the need for this program as a means of attracting industry that would diversify the State's economic base and prevent the massive economic dislocations which have resulted from the extractive and single industry dependency of the past. The recommended appropriation for this program will allow the Depart- ment to finance a portion of the backlog of applications resulting from the widespread desire to participate in this program. DISTINGUISHED DAUGHTERS OF PENNSYLVANIA: The funds appropriated for this program are used to honor outstanding women of Pennsylvania through an annual luncheon hosted by the Governor. PORT DEVELOPMENT: The Port Development program is designed to stimulate Pennsylvania based industry to handle foreign trade by improv- ing and developing the port facilities of Erie and Philadelphia. Both ports have experienced a relative decline in shipping tonnage as a result of the failure to keep pace with modern cargo handling developments, particularly in the use of containers. The amounts recommended will help the respective ports offset the amortization costs of new facilities until such time as they become self-sus- taining. KEYSTONE CORRIDOR: This program examines the feasibility of developing a high-speed (150-300 mph) ground transportation system across Pennsylvania through an impact study. The U. S. Department of Trans- portation (Office of High-Speed Ground Transportation) has initiated the Northeast Corridor Project between New York City\u2014Philadelphia\u2014Wash- ington, D. C. to improve ground transportation. The Keystone Corridor, If developed, would connect with the Federal facility. The studies are funded by the Bureau of Business Services. They in- clude a demand analysis, an economic impact projection, a comparison of the corridor with present railroad facilities, and a route and configuration study. Upon completion of these studies, a decision may be made to acquire land for the Keystone Corridor. If so, land acquisition will be funded through the Pennsylvania Transportation Assistance Authority, perhaps in 1971-72. 66 Commerce ID Source of Funds (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Ill Ill Appropriations: Pennsylvaina Science and Engineering Estimated Expend. $1,400 Increase Decrease $ 475 Budget $1,875 Distinguished Daughters 2 2 Port of Erie 250 250 Port of Philadelphia 600 600 Keystone Corridor 250 250 Total $2,252 $ 725 $2,977 1 II II 67 Department of Community Affairs (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 General Government (1) Provided Estimated (4) Requested (5) Change (6) -(3) (6) Budget (2) Lapse (3) Expend.

The bureau structure includes Divisions of Train- ing, Technical Assistance, Information Services, Legal, and Municipal Statis- tics. The Training Division encourages and sponsors training for careers in local government and improves the skills of local government officials by sponsoring internship programs for undergraduate students during the summer months. It provides seminars and training programs for local gov- ernment employes and officials, and coordinates all training programs offered by other state agencies. The Technical Assistance and Information Divisions are aimed at im- proving the administrative systems and strengthening the institutional struc- tures so that local governments are able to respond effectively to local needs. The division offers the services of staff municipal consultants in the fields of finance, assessment and taxation, personnel, public works, intergovernmental cooperation, and general administration to assist local units in solving specific problems, A wide range of pamphlets are published and a central library is maintained. The Legal Division assists local governments in bond financing and ex- amines all proposed issues for conformance with general law and bonded in- tlebtedness limitations. The Division of Municipal Statistics receives and reviews budgets, tax reports, and financial statements for every unit of local government and pub- lishes annual reports on local fmances. The recommended increase for Community Services will provide for continuing the municipal training and technical assistance programs that were started in 1968 with Federal grant funds which will not repeat.

The Bureau of Planning is responsible under this program for sponsoring local planning studies and supervising their execution. The bureau has recently established a unit which will perform actual planning studies where private consultants are unable to undertake the study. In addition, the bureau administers the Planning Assistance program and the Planning Revolving Fund discussed under Grants and Subsidies. The recommended funds for the planning program will provide for an expansion of the plans preparation unit, which performs actual studies for small municipalities, and a regional planning division to perform studies for larger groups of political subdivisions.

Increase Decrease $22,986 Budget $58,336 HOUSING ASSISTANCE: The Housing Assistance program assists com- munities and local housing authorities in improving the quality and supply of housing occupied by low and middle income families presently forced to live in sub-standard units. The major components of the program are the sales program which provides single family units through new construction and/or rehabilitation of existing units which are structually sound but in need of extensive improve- ment to meet code standards and the rental program which provides ad- vance planning of multiple unit facilities to be constructed under FHA guar- anteed financing. Both programs are financed primarily with State funds on a forgivable loan basis to be repaid from the proceeds of the sale or from private financing after it is approved by FHA. The Housing program is flex- ible and complements and coordinates with local, Federal, or private, non- profit, housing programs. An indirect objective of the Housing program is to stimulate the housing construction industry to offer added employment and training for unemployed and underemployed Pennsylvanians in the building trades. The recommended appropriation will provide the first payment to a proposed Revolving Fund which would be created to facilitate the loan ar- rangement. When the fund has a working capital of approximately $50 mil- lion, additional State funds will be needed only to replace the unrecover- able portion of the loans. The money requested for this program will pro- vide an estimated 15,000 housing unit starts in 1969-70. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSING AGENCY: The objective of this agency is to enhance the ability of families of moderate income, including the elderly, to purchase homes through a loan program at reduced interest rates. The agency's authorization to issue and sell bonds becomes effective when the Governor by proclamation declares that sufficient monies are available to secure the bonds. The recommended appropriation will create a capital reserve fund for this purpose. The budgeted amount will enable the agency to provide $50 million. to finance program objectives. REDEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE: The Redevelopment Assistance pro- gram helps localities, with Federal Government aid, to eliminate and prevent. slums and blight, both residential and non-residential. The major activities: are: 1. Urban Renewal\u2014State funds are provided on a 50-50 matching basis to local redevelopment authorities for advance planning prior to application for Federal funds for a renewal project. State contributions for execution of a renewal project including acquisition of the area, relocation of residents, and demolition of the existing structures is on the basis of 1/6 State, 1/6 local, and 2/3 Federal. 2. Model Cities\u2014Funds are available within the Redevelopment Assist- ance appropriation for grants to cities which have applied for Federal Model Cities planning funds but have not been selected under the Federal program limitation. The model cities concept calls for a total concentration of local, State and Federal resources on the physical, social, and economic problems facing a major neighborhood area of the city. II II II 1 73 Community Affairs 3, Code Enforcement and Demolition\u2014This program is designed to pre- vent blight and deterioration of an area or correct it in its early stages in order to 'save' the area. This is accomplished by joint Federal-State-local grants or loans to low income families in owner-occupied units for repairs or improvements to bring the unit to code standards. If the owner is un- willing to cooperate, the property may be taken by the local unit for re- habilitation. Funds are also available for demolition of buildings which cannot be salvaged. Limited funds are available in the appropriation for demolition projects and for repairs to public housing units constructed by the State in the mid 1950s. The funds recommended for Redevelopment Assistance will permit con- tinuation of the program at the existing level of approximately $126.5 million including Federal, State, and local funds. COMMUNITY RECREATION ASSISTANCE: The Community Recrea- tion Assistance program is designed to provide various leisure time oppor- tunities that are accessible, safe, attractive, not too crowded, and enjoyable for citizens of all ages. The objective is met by a combination of grant programs, two of which are financed from special funds. The Project '70 Fund, created subsequent to constitutional authoriza- tion in 1964, provides grants to assist local government units in acquiring land for community open space and park areas. Funds are granted to local governments from the Land and Water Development Fund, created from a $500 million bond authorization approved by the voters as a constitutional amendment in 1967, for the development of park areas acquired under Project '70. The grant may be used for a variety of planned developments ranging from swimming pools and skating rinks to baseball fields, tot lots, picnic groves and nature areas. The third facet of the recreation program is financed from a Gen- eral Fund appropriation. The program is designed to meet the recreation objective through grants to local government for the support of full and part-time recreation staffs that plan and supervise activity programs. The proposed ReCreation Assistance program will provide funds to initiate approximately 10 community recreation programs. MASS TRANSPORTATION ASSISTANCE: The Commonwealth's Mass Transportation program is aimed at developing efficient and coordinated common carrier mass transportation systems in the urban areas of the Com- monwealth by providing financial assistance to local transportation organiza- tions and companies. This aid is provided thorugh capital grants either spon- sored by the Department through the Pennsylvania Transportation Assistance Authority (financed by general obligations bonds of the Commonwealth) or through operating grants from General Fund appropriations. The Penn Central and Reading Railroads and 31. bus companies operat- ing commuter services within the Commonwealth are presently operating 434 rail commuter cars which are 20 to 45 years old, 1,425 buses over 10 years old, and 545 trolley cars over 20 years old. All of this equipment must be replaced. Facilities (stations, transportation centers, parking, right of way, etc.) are inadequate and service is substandard and unacceptable. It is an- ticipated that improved passenger equipment and facilities will increase ridership and thus reduce the General Fund aid that is required to retain commuter lines that are socially desirable but economically unjustified. In addition to the purchase of service; General Fund monies -are used for demonstration projects, research, and advertising and promotion pro- grams. 1 74 The recommended appropriation will provide purchase of service grants to local authorities at the legal maximum of 2/3 of the operating deficit and will provide an increase for research and planning for new transportation authorities starting in smaller cities.

The program helps those who lack academic and vocational education and training. The funds are used either directly by the Bureau of Economic Oppor- tunity or through local agencies to recruit the unemployables, provide mini- mum academic and attitude training necessary, place the trainees in on-the- job training situations, pay excess training and transportation costs, and, most important, entice industry to make training and jobs available. It is anticipated that 7,500 persons will benefit directly from the program.

This is consistent with the goal of the general Communiy Services program to improve and modernize local government administrative structures and personnel. 1 75 Community Affairs Many local governments are too small to perform the necessary services alone. In certain instances it is more feasible for larger units to perform joint services. The recommended appropriation will provide matching \"seed\" grants of $5,000 to each of six regional groups to assist in organizational expenses. CHARTER COMMISSION GRANTS: The program objective of the Charter Commission grant appropriation is to stimulate local government to undertake studies of their existing governmental structures and adopt new and improved structures to meet the challenge of modern society. This is consistent with the goal of the general Community Services program\u2014the improvement and modernization of local government administrative struc- tures and personnel. As a result of the recent constitutional revision, all units of local government will have the opportunity of selecting an optional form of government. The amount budgeted for this program will provide matching grants to six cities to aid the commission in meeting expenses and in disseminating information on the proposal prior to public referendum. PARTNER CITIES: The objective of the Partner Cities program is to enhance the capability of the target city to solve its social, economic and en- vironmental problems. Services are specifically designed to help the com- munity leadership improve its organizational capacity to marshal human and dollar resources and deliver needed services. The recommended appropriation will provide two teams with experts in the fields of fiscal and personnel affairs, public safety, public works, physical development and human development. Each team will serve three cities during the 1969-70 year. In addition, funds are available for special purpose grants to the cities which cannot initially be financed from other sources.

Applications for 80 Pennsylvania communities have re- cently been returned from the Department of Housing and Urban Develop- ment due to the lack of Federal funds. The recommended amount will enable the Department to finance 15 to 20 planning studies in 1969-70. PLANNING REVOLVING FUND: The objective of the Planning Revolv- ing Fund is to provide payments to local government units to overcome the delay in final Federal close-out of Federal Urban Planning Studies and pay- ment of the Federal retention. Federal policy specifies that 10 per cent of each planning budget (constituting several local studies) shall not be paid to the agency preparing the comprehensive plan until a final audit has been made, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development certifies that each study has been completed as specified in the original budget. Since the amount requested would be repaid to the Commonwealth when the retention has been released, future funds will not be needed. This small fund will relieve the financial burden imposed on private con- sultants working for the Commonwealth.

The functions of this fund are now provided for in the Water Resources Pro- gram of General Government and in a separate appropriation for Flood Control Projects. The appropriation provides the State's share of the costs of building major flood control structures through Federal, State and local cooperation. The local jurisdiction acquires the land and the right-of-way and maintains the structures. The State generally pays 50 per cent of the cost of the land. The Federal contribution is for building the structure. The Chartiers Valley Project requires $1.7 million for 1969-70. The Great Lakes Basin Commission appropriation provides for paying Pennsylvania's share of the cost of operating the Great Lakes Basin Com- mission which is a coordinated effort by the Federal, State and local govern- ments and private enterprise to conserve, develop and utilize the water and related land resources of the Great Lakes Basin. The Great Lakes Basin Commission is engaged in the preparation of a Comprehensive Plan that coordinates other studies and planning efforts of Federal and State agencies relating to the water and land resources of the Basin. The budget provides for an increase to support this program. The Delaware River Master appropriation provides for Pennsylvania's share of the expenses of the Delaware River Master. The Master allocates the water supply of the Delaware River among Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey and the City of New York in accordance with the U. S. Supreme Court decree of June 7, 1954. This program will remain at the present level. The Annual Fixed Charges\u2014Flood Lands appropriation provides for pay- ments in lieu of taxes on land acquired for water resources and flood control.

Since its formation in 1906 the Bureau has filed a total of 12,615,448 original certificates of birth and 7,065,406 original certificates of death. There were 5,191 delayed birth certificates also filed for 1967 for individuals who were born in Pennsylvania prior to 1906. In 1967, some 530,000 requests for copies of vital records were received and processed. A total of $437,000 in fees was received and transmitted to the State Treasury. A contract was negotiated with a storage company for security storage of the microfilmed images of vital statistics records. Ap- proximately 3,712 rolls of film were stored in a master air conditioned vault constructed in solid limestone 220 feet underground. The 1969-70 budget will provide for the continuation of the present level of service plus a slight increase in the Division of Vital Statistics. This will provide the necessary increase in staff to implement the issuance of burial permits from any duly appointed Registrar regardless of where the death occurred in the Commonwealth.

It encourages the development of research, studies and demonstrations designed to improve methods for delivering health serv- ices to better understand the nature and causes of disease; and seeks to im- prove the collection, tabulation, analysis, and distribution of biostatistical data. During 1967, the Division of Biostatistics provided consultative services to program personnel within the Department. Specific projects included: a health attitude study of a lower socio-economic group in Wilkes-Barre; a survey in Erie County of attitudes and knowledge about refuse problems; a State-wide solid waste survey; a study of the effects of fluoridation in Lancaster County; and a rural health demonstration project in Columbia, Montour, Northumberland, Snyder and Union Counties. The Division of Planning made the necessary revisions to the biennial 1966-68 Department of Health Plan: provided a course of instruction on Com- prehensive Health Planning for health executives; and served on the Advisory Committee to the Department of Public Instruction's first educational tele- vision program on sex education. The Division of Research developed various research projects preparatory to submission for Federal grants. A study on characteristics and turnover of nursing personnel in Pennsylvania nursing homes was initiated. The 1969-70 budget will provide funds totaling $770,000 to support public health research conducted by universities and medical institutions and public health research conducted by the Bureau's staff.

Last year a utilization survey of health services was conducted in region I and venereal disease workshops for teachers were conducted in several school districts. Dental health education, especially in fluoridation, was a major effort, stressing cooperation between dentists, engineers and community agencies. A total of 918,386 pamphlets on health subjects were distributed and the film library's 920 health films were shown to over 787,000 people. The 1969-70 budget for this program will provide for a continuation of the present level of services. Special Federal Projects (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Increase Expend.

The program also maintains the central office advisory function support- ing the Department's Local Health Services program and provides consultative services, central direction and policy formulation in the various public health activities. Specialists advise the Secretary of Health and make medical and tech- nical decisions. Although a majority of the direct service work is performed by personnel of the seven regions of the Local Health Services program, special activities of Statewide application are under the direction of central office personnel in this program. This program also operates the Institute of Alcoholism, Narcotic Addic- tion and Compulsive Gambling at Philadelphia and administers the State Crippled Children's Hospital and the State tuberculosis hospitals. The 1969-70 budget provides for expanded services in food inspection, dental health, orthopedic services in Philadelphia and Allegheny Counties, maternal and child health, and provides for the implementation of recently passed legislation requiring the licensing of water and sewage treatment plant operators. In addition, expanded services are provided for vector control, drug control, and cancer control.

NURSING: Provides public health nursing services in those areas of the State not otherwise covered and promotes, encourages and assists in the improvement of public health nursing service in covered areas to the end that morbidity and mortality may be reduced. Last year public health nursing service was provided by 304 public health nurses. The number of counties in which these nurses provided care of the sick at home was reduced from 47 to 43. This was in part due to con- sultation and stimulation provided by the Division to county groups inter- ested in establishing local home health agencies, and also to encouragement given to voluntary nursing agencies to extend their geographic coverage to entire counties. A study of Department of Health nurses who received traineeships was completed to determine the effect of traineeships in encouraging nurses to complete degree requirements. Some 41.4 percent completed the require- ments. The study also showed that nurses who received financial assistance for educational purposes have remained in Health Department employment longer than nurses who did not receive financial aid. In regard to the Medicare program, eight initial certification survey visits were made to home health agencies, 35 agencies were re-surveyed, and nursing consultation was provided to 40 agencies. SANITATION: Attempts to minimize or eradicate the threat of an out- break of arthropod and rodent-borne disease in the Commonwealth; insure e III Ill III II 89 Health that all migrant labor camps comply with migrant labor sanitation regula- tions; eliminate health hazards from improperly located and constructed in- dividual and semi-public water supplies through inspection and issuance of permits. During 1967-68 special emphasis was placed on the implementation of the Sewage Facilities Act and the Federal Solid Waste Act. Sanitarians inspectea environmental conditions in geriatric and nursing homes and child care in- stitutions. These inspections resulted in improved sanitation in food service, laundry, refuse, water, sewage, and general housekeeping. In-service train- ing courses were given to food service and custodial personnel working in public schools. Approximately $2,219,000 was spent by school districts to improve en- vironmental conditions. Over 5,000 inspections were conducted at 2,491 public swimming pools. Ninety-two public pools were closed temporarily due to poor water clarity and unsatisfactory disinfection procedures. Enforcement action was initiated against 21 pool operators; 450 violations relating to water supplies, on-lot sewage disposal systems, and refuse disposal practices were corrected in mobile home parks; enforcement action was taken against 59 mobile home park operators who violated health regulations; and 1,700 inspec- tions were conducted at 397 migrant labor camps under a United States Public Health Service Migrant Labor Project grant. This inspection resulted in bringing 75 percent of the labor camps into compliance for the season. Sanitarians conducted 2,200 inspections at the 1,200 organized camps and camp grounds in the Commonwealth. There were 20,573 inspections made of public eating and drinking places, and 294 enforcement actions initiated. Mosquito control activities were initiated in four State parks and three additional counties. Three training courses on rat control were presented to housing inspectors in three counties and two State-wide vector control courses were given to hospital and institutional personnel. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH: Establishes effective occupational health activities in places of employment in the Commonwealth and investigates occupational disease cases with the help of industrial physicians and union personnel. The Division made 41 environmental surveys in 39 primary metal in- dustry plants to evaluate the effects of employee exposure to silica dust, metal dust and fumes and gases which resulted in 123 recommendations for im- provements. The Division aided the Department of Labor and Industry in the evaluation of claimants for occupational disease payments. A total of 22,056 medical records were reviewed and 14,218 cases suggested for transmittal to the Workmen's Compensation Board for payment. Dust hazards to rotary drill operators were studied and work was begun to install adequate dust control devices on all drilling equipment. A study of X-ray diffraction type apparatus in industries, research fa- cilities, and universities was completed. Recommendations for design and operating procedures were sent to each user. Health Services provided included 4,937 influenza immunizations, 468 tetanus for occupa- tional injury treatments. A total of 119 physical examinations .were given for state employes 55 years of age or over. A health unit was established in the new Highway and Safety Building, making seven such units in the capitol complex. ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY: Attempts to lower the accident potential, prevent or lessen the severity of injury, and assure a decent, safe and sanitary home for all residents of the Commonwealth. Three basic training classes were conducted for 125 local housing in- 90 1 1 Health spectors in interest in Barre, and nicipalities Erie, Scranton, and Pittsburgh. Housing seminars to stimulate code adoption and enforcement were held in Allentown, Wilkes- Erie. Approximately 230 people representing 55 different mu- attended. Homeand family safety classes graduated approximately 800 high school girls. During the year 1,411 ambUlance attendants completed training classes held in 30 communities, and 275 ambulance attendants received technical training at a three-day emergency medical care seminar in Pittsburgh. A burn seminar was held in Harrisburg Hospital for over 300 Central Penn- sylvania ambulance attendants. SANITARY ENGINEERING: Prevents pollution of waters and insures safe public water supplies and swimming facilities; improves the State's more than 2,300 miles of streams adversely affected by mine drainage; improves water pollution control technology by establishing a research and develop- ment grant program; and creates a State authority to construct water supply and waste treatment plants where needed to protect public health and pre- vent pollution. Federal and State grants for local water sewerage services were in- creased significantly. Pennsylvania municipalities received over $59 million hi grants and loans during 1967, an increase of 70 percent over the previous year. A comprehensive water quality study of Neshaminy Creek was com- pleted and municipalities and industries were given one year to develop a joint project to meet the water quality goals, using a least-cost approach. A pilot project to evaluate the benefits of citizens' pollution patrol was initiated. Training was given to interested residents in the lower West Branch Susquehanna River areas. Total new sewerage construction was valued at $64.1 million in 1967, an increase of $31.5 million over the previous year. Twenty-three contracts for new sewage treatment plants, at a cost of $21.3 million, and 23 contracts for plant replacements, additions or modifications, at a cost of $4.3 million, were awarded. Fifty-three interceptor and collecting sewer system contracts were awarded, costing $38.5 million. More application for construction grants under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, P. L. 660, were processed than in any previous year. The largest project certified, $3.9 million, was the Lancaster Area Sewer Authority. At the end of 1967, 86 percent of the industrial waste cases were in com- pliance or making satisfactory progress. During the year, 400 permits were issued for the operation of coal mines. Over 30 mine drainage treatment facilities were constructed. Field work was performed on the Clarion River Basin to collect samples of acid discharge, measure flows, and analyze samples of abandoned bituminous deep mine operations. The Federal Water Pollution Control Administration has finished the mine drainage pollution source inventory on the Susquehanna and Monongahela basins. As a result of these detailed studies, the estimated cost of mine drainage pollution abatement is now about $1 billion. AIR POLLUTION CONTROL: Provides enforcement of Commission regulations; establishes intensive control in 15 air basins; and completes registration of all pollution sources and provides for the establishment of a 30-station automatic air monitoring system. An air monitoring system was installed in August 1967 with pollution sensors located in Allentown, the first of a proposed 25-station surveillance network. More than 400 new complaints on air pollution were registered and in- vestigated, and 75 percent proved to be valid. Area air pollution surveys in- cluded the Wyoming-Lackawanna Valley, the Monongahela Valley, Lower Butler County, the Community of Latrobe, and the communities of Lock Haven and Williamsport. Thousands of air quality determinations were made during the course of the surveys. GD Ill III Ill 01 Health The pollen surveillance network was maintained during the 1967 pollen season. The number of requests on pollen-contaminated areas of the State were more than double those received in any previous year. COMMUNICABLE DISEASES: Prevents the spread of communicable diseases; studies their epidemiological patterns; and promotes, encourages and assists communities in developing effective preventive activities and 6ervices. During the year, 32 counties reported 112 cases of encephalitis. There were 1,514 cases of viral hepatitis reported, and the incidence of malaria contracted abroad and classified as imported malaria continued to increase. Of the 2,101 malaria cases in the United States last year, 157 were in Penn- sylvania, mostly contracted in Viet Nam. Three cases of poliomyelitis oc- curred in Pennsylvania during 1967. There were 856 isolations of salmonella organisms and five Typhoid cases. Five cases of tetanus were reported, all fatal. The Community Vaccination Program provided 55,135 measles im- munizations. In addition, 73,319 children completed polio, and 80,805 com- pleted DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus) immunizations. There were 16,194 reported cases of veneral disease in Pennsylvania during 1967. There were 16 rabies cases; 8 cases of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever; 3 cases of trichinosis; 4 cases of toxoplasmosis; 2 cases of cat scratch fever; 2 cases of psittacosis; and 7 cases of brucellosis. ALCOHOLISM: Minimizes the impact of alcoholism on society and upon individuals suffering from the disease through education, casefinding, treat- ment, rehabilitation and research. Four new clinics were begun in 1967, bringing the total number of out- patient clinics throughout the Commonwealth to 19. These clinics served 3,130 patients during the year and reported that they were able to close 1,221 cases. A total of 855 patients was referred to at the State Alcoholism Rehabilitation Unit at Danville and to private institutions. Nine 1-day con- ferences on Youth and Alcohol were conducted with more than 1,100 high school students from 477 schools in 65 counties attending. College programs for students and faculty were held at five institutions. DRUG CONTROL: Minimizes the abuse of drugs through inspection of drug-handling firms and through enforcement of State laws; provides services and facilities designed to rehabilitate addicts. Some $250,000 worth of drugs, which were either misbranded, contraband, or adulterated, were destroyed during the year. This merchandise was un- covered during the 638 technical inspections of manufacturers and whole- salers of drugs and cosmetics. Every pharmacy in Pennsylvania has been inspected for adherence to the Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act. Active registration includes approximately 30,000 retailers, 1,000 wholesalers, and nearly 200 manufacturers. Twelve new poison treatment - centers were established. DENTAL HEALTH: Encourages, promotes, and participates in the de- velopment of preventive community dental health services. The Dentofacial Deformity Treatment activity for children under age 16 was continued and showed an increase of approximately 25 percent over the 1966 activity. Treatment was provided by a panel of 131 orthodontists and a committee of six orthodontia clinical consultants. Fluoridation of water supplies for approximately 100,000 Pennsylvanians was initiated during the year. It is estimated that 50 percent of the State population served by public water supplies is now protected by fluoridation. Seventy-nine school dental hygienists participated in an educational conference entitled \"The Dental Hygienist in Community Health Planning.\" CHRONIC DISEASES: Encourages and assists in the development and expansion of local programs for improving health services for the chronically ill and aged through the use of multiphasic screening, diabetes control, and glaucoma detection. In the area of cardiovascular diseases there were two major advances. First, there was an intensified effort to reduce sudden death from myo-cardial 92 Health infractions by encouraging smaller community hospitals to institute intensive coronary care services. Three such faciliities were started. The second de- velopment was an increase in stroke rehabilitation. Clinic sessions were held at 11 locations and three new clinics were established. Diabetes screening was provided for 152,182 persons during 1967. Two hundred and seventeen projects were conducted in 49 counties and 560 new diabetics were discovered. Screening for anemia was initiated and 24 projects were conducted with 14,162 persons tested resulting in discovery of 472 borderline cases and 447 positive. A specialized arthritis center was established at the Albert Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia under the joint sponsorship of the Albert Einstein Hospital and the Department of Health. Glaucoma screening was conducted in 15 counties and 40 projects were held with 12,605 persons screened. Of these, 805 had positive results and were referred to their physicians; 71 were found to have glaucoma. The seizure clinic in Williamsport evaluated 46 patients in eleven clinic sessions during 1967. Co-sponsorship of the multiple sclerosis clinic and allied clinical re- search at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania was continued. Clinic visits totaled 338 with 95 multiple sclerosis patients participating. The Cancer Control Section supported tumor clinics and registry services at 91 hospitals. Four additional hospitals received grants in support of cancer control ac- tivities. Over 8,100 women took advantage of \"Pap\" tests for uterine cancer detection. Follow-up of 412,779 persons screened in chest X-ray surveys showed 73 with previously undetected primary cancer of the lungs. The medical reasons for traffic accidents received increased attention and 1,711 motor vehicle operator license applications were reviewed during the year to resolve questionable medical findings. MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH: Reduces fetal, infant, child, and maternal illness by mobilizing available resources of the Commonwealth. Clinics are conducted to provide immunization for children, education in pre- natal care for mothers, and testing activities for the detection of phenyl- ketonuria and other metabolic diseases. Orthopedic,- hearing and speech diagnostic services are also provided. Child Health Conference locations increased from 174 to 179 and a total of 38,607 children were served. Some 2,614 children were referred for follow- up investigations. The two public health laboratories performed 109,595 PKU screening tests during 1967. Of these, 65 were presumptive positive tests and 15 were confirmed as positive. The special project for neonatal surgery supported by Federal funds was continued at Children's Hospital, Philadelphia and as of July 1, 1966, it was expanded to include St. Christopher's Hospital, Phila- delphia. During the period July 1, 1966, to June 30, 1967, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia cared for 142 children, of which 96 were new patients; St. Christopher's cared for 15; and Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh cared for 56, of which 46 were new patients. During the fiscal year 1966-67, two addi- tional monthly orthopedic diagnostic clinics were established at East Strouds- burg, Monroe County, and at Johnstown, Cambria County. The Hearing Conservation Center at Lancaster was approved for providing otologic and audio-logic services, making a total of 13 centers. By July 1, 1967, all five well-child copferences in York County and one in Westmoreland County were engaged in audiometric screening of children. The Hearing Conservation activity provided more services to more children than ever before. The Chil- dren's Cardiac activity continued its operation of 17 State children's cardiac clinics. Examinations at these clinics for fiscal 1966-67 numbered 3,136. Three main cystic fibrosis centers and three satellite clinics furnished ID fill Ill II II II II II 93 Health diagnostic services and extensive medical treatment to children afflicted with cystic fibrosis. Through continuous medical observation and ever-im- proving methods of treatment, the life expectancy of the cystic fibrosis patient is increasing. Many are attending colleges and others are gainfully employed. The caseload increased from 392 in 1966 to 424 in 1967. CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASES: Provides services and encour- ages and assists in the provision of services designed to prevent the trans- mission of tuberculosis; provides high quality care and assists in rehabilitation. The principal functions are; supervision and hospitalization of active tuberculosis patients, casefinding, and diagnostic and clinic services. This Division also operated a State-wide chest X-ray program and supervised school tuberculin testing for all first and ninth grade students. Final data for 1967 showed 2,751 active new cases compared with 2,664 in 1966. This increase was attributed to intensified case-finding and improved reporting procedures rather than to an actual increase in tuberculosis. X-ray surveys were conducted in 61 counties, with special emphasis in high incidence communities. Some 440,328 chest X-rays were taken, an in- crease of about 10,000 over 1966. Of the total, 406,809 were for the general public, 27,302 for nursing and convalescent homes, and 6,217 for special groups. PHYSICAL THERAPY: Encourages the development of and provides physical therapy services to orthopedically handicapped children and chil- dren with cystic fibrosis. Direct patient services showed a slight increase during 1967. A total of 1,030 handicapped children, enrolled in State orthopedic clinics, were re- ferred for physical therapy. During the year, 198 cystic fibrosis children from State clinics were referred for physical therapy. Consultation to nursing home personnel was provided in areas where a local physical therapist was not available. A total of 70 reimbursable home health visits were made by the staff during the year. DIVISION OF LABORATORIES: Provides the Department of Health and the Commonwealth with the resources for investigation, diagnosis, and control of diseases and potential health hazard conditions. Services include general bacteriological study of water, virology, serology, parasitology, entomology, and mycology. A total of 32,601 clinical specimens were examined, a decrease from 33,435 in 1966. Tuberculosis bacteriology had a specimen increase of 2,622 samples over 1966. A total of 2,895 reference cultures were processed; 2,442 were done in 1966. Enteric bacteriology showed a six percent increase in pathogenic isolations, identifications, and confirmations, which was attributed to refinements in isolation and planting techniques. Routine water samples decreased by 13,718 to 51,229 in 1967. A change in technique meant handling of an additional 8 to 10 tubes per test, giving a more accurate test but a higher workload. Examinations of animal tissue for rabies virus infection increased from 202 in 1966 to 294 in 1967. All virus serology was adopted to the microtiter test in 1967. A total of 207 serum pools, representing 1,206 individuals, was examined for influenza bodies. A total of 6,335 serums was examined in 1967 for diabetes detection, and routine tests were done on 61,477 serums of newborn infants for detection of phenyl- ketonuria. Additional studies were conducted on St. Louis virus in cell culture. Special emphasis was given to preparing better influenza A and B antigens. An effort was made to grow rhinoviruses responsible for the common cold in humans, and to obtain antigens which could be used in a complement fixa- tion test. The 1969-70 budget for the Local Health Services Program will provide funds for additional positions to implement the expanded programs requested in advisory and Special Health program. 94II 11 II Ii 1 1 Health FEDERAL FUNDS: The Federal government assists the State through a variety of programs under the U. S. Department of Health, Education and . Welfare and the U. S. Department of the Interior. The various Federal pro- grams and the degree of contribution are as follows: Maternal and Child Health Services and Aid to Crippled Children, varying bases; General Health Services, matching; Veneral Disease Projects, matching; Tubercu- Control, matching; Heart Disease Control, matching; Cancer Control, matching; Water Pollution Control, based on per capita income; Chronically Ill and Aged, one to two Federal; Radiological Health, snatching; Home Health Services, one to nine Federal and Public Health Service, Block Grants.

The continuing need for tuberculosis beds was demonstrated by the admission in 1967 of 1,822 patients to Pennsylvania's state tuberculosis hos- pitals. Of these, 1,496, or 82 percent, were diagnosed as suffering either mod- erate or far advanced TB. Only 6.3 percent were found to have minimal disease and 11.6 percent were admitted for diagnostic study. Also during 1967 the state tuberculosis hospitals discharged a total of 2,020 patients. Both of the state tuberculosis hospitals are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals.

Health A careful study of the need for institutional facilities resulted in a de- cision to phase out the Dixon Hospital effective July 1, 1968. The Department of Public Welfare now has responsibility for Dixon Hospital and is using it as a restoration center. The number of tuberculosis patients requiring hospital care has declined to the point where the Marcy Hospital in Pittsburgh and the Landis Hospital in Philadelphia can handle the patient load. On the basis of this continuing decline, it is anticipated that there will be 750 avail- able beds at the Landis and Marcy Hospitals by the end of the 1968-69 fiscal period. A review of the distribution of patients admitted to State tuberculosis hospitals during 1967 shows that 58 percent were from the 17 eastern counties, 28 percent were from the western one-third or 19 counties and only 14 percent resided in the 31 central counties. The 1969-70 budget will provide for a continuation of the present level of services. The State Crippled Children's Hospital at Elizabethtown provides a com- prehensive center for diagnosis, restoration and rehabilitation of physically disabled children of the Commonwealth and seeks to reduce or eliminate physical handicaps. Many children suffer congenital or acquired conditions of the skeletal, neuromuscular systems and the soft tissues which will result in limiting or deforming handicaps without early and appropriate treatment. Birth statistics reveal that in 1966 there were 1,022 live births with reported congenital musculoskeletal defects and 263 with nervous system defects. Some 300 chil- dren are born each year suffering cerebral palsy. Accidents also contribute to serious disabilities. The State Hospital for Crippled Children provides both out-patient and in-patient diagnostic and treatment services to disabled children from infancy to age 21. Patients receive nursing care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, braces and prosthetic devices, psychological evalu- ation, social service casework, laboratory and X-ray study, and education in the accredited school. There are 208 beds in the hospital. In 1967 over 2,400 children were treated for a wide variety of orthopedic or neurological dis- abilities, cerebral palsy, and burns. New operative methods and approaches and the acquisition of skilled surgeons have resulted in a considerable in- crease in surgery. There were 298 operations in fiscal year 1959-60. In 1966-67 there were 677. An orthopedic clinic is held weekly for the diagnosis and treatment of out-patients, as well as follow-up care for discharged hospital patients. Specialty clinics are held at monthly or more frequent intervals for patients with amputations, cerebral palsy, hand dysfunction, rehabilitative urology problems, or neurological conditions. A renovated, modernized and greatly reorganized out-patient clinic area is in the capital budget for 1968-70. Nearly 4500 separate out-patient visits were logged in the fiscal year 1966-67.

This reimbursement for medical and nursing services amounts to $4.30 per child in average daily membership in public and private schools in the Commonwealth. The school districts are also re- imbursed 40 cents per child in average daily membership for dental services or $1.00 per child receiving dental hygiene services. It is also the goal of the Health Department to insure maximum protec- tion from enviornmental hazards. To accomplish this goal the department provides technical consultation and guidance to communities throughout the Commonwealth in water purity, sewage disposal and solid wastes. In order to eliminate public health hazards and water pollution resulting from inade- quate individual sewage disposal facilities the department administers the Pennsylvania Sewages Facilities Act. In addition funds are provided to mu- nicipalities for cost incurred in developing plans and programs regarding the storage and collection of solid wastes. In keeping with the goal of insuring every person, the maximum available protection from environmental hazards the 1969-70 budget contains $1.8 million for housing hygiene. These funds will support legislation which will be introduced to provide grants to local governments to establish and enforce a Housing Hygiene code. In the past, by separate legislative authority, funds were provided for research in cancer, heart disease, cerebral palsy, and diseases of the chron- ically ill and aged at several specified institutes and hospitals. It is recom- mended that $770,000 be authorized under General Government Operations, Planning, Evaluation and Research Program, for the administration and de- velopment of research programs in those institutions which have demon- strated significant contributions to the health sciences and which can develop new and improved research methods for solving complex health problems.

Local Health Services Toward meeting the goal of providing comprehensive health services to the citizens of the Commonwealth, the Department of Health encourages the establishment of local health departments through provision of State grants-in-aid to county or city departments of health. The Commonwealth participates in the establishment and maintenance of local health departments by providing grants-in-aid of 75 cents per capita. Currently, the counties of Allegheny, Bucks, Chester, Erie, and Philadelphia and the Allentown-Bethlehem hi-city health departments receive grants. The 1969-70 budget provides for the continuation of the present level of services. Source of Funds (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Increase Expend.

The ultimate goal is to complete liquidation proceedings of five or six companies a year, and for this reason the Division is being reorganized and restaffed. This should be completed by the end of fiscal 1968-69. The Division has developed data processing plans and procedures which will facilitate the processing of assessments, billings, financial records and dis- tributions. In the initial stages costs will appear high. As the programs are developed and installed, costs per unit of production will drop well below the present level and production will rise, allowing the Division to handle liquidations at a much faster rate than at present.

Company failures are analyzed and company records are searched for escheatable items and other matters. Efforts are made to rehabilitate companies found to be in a pre- carious financial position. Services provided by this program include the examination of 370 domestic insurance companies, holding companies and affiliates. Approx- imately half of these companies will be examined on an annual basis. The examination is to determine that the insurance companies are conducting their business in the best interest of the public, policyholders and creditors; to test for solvency, and to ascertain whether the companies are complying with the insurance laws, regulations and bulletins of the Department. The Division of Company Audits will be responsible for the annual audit of approximately 1,200 domestic, foreign and alien insurance companies, and the quarterly audit of approximately 250 insurance companies. The Di- vision of Company Admissions will review annually approximately 35 appli- cations for companies desiring to do business in the Commonwealth. The Bureau of Licenses will continue to process mergers, reinsurance agreements, insider trading, management contracts and proxy regulations. With the great surge of mergers, the number of companies which are going public, and the acquisition of insurance companies by conglomerates and holding companies, we estimate that a review of these will run approximately 100 a year. The Division of Agents and Brokers will list approximately 20,000 appli- cants annually for life, accident and health, property, casualty, title, surplus lines, public adjusters and brokers examinations. It also will renew 200,000 agent's licenses and 15,000 broker's licenses, plus approximately 50 public ad- juster's licenses, 100 surplus lines agent's licenses, 509 title agent's licenses, and 140 professional bondsmen. During the next five years, there will be an increase in the number of examinations to be performed by this Section. Additional examiners are needed in light of Act No. 205, signed by the Governor July 20, 1968. The new law requires that every domestic insurance company be examined dur- ing the first five years of its existence. Also, the Department, in accordance With Section 214 of the Insurance Department Act, is examining holding com- panies owning stock in insurance companies. 106 III Ga ID II Insurance Source of Funds Augmentation: Reimbursements from Companies (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Expend.

The Bureau of- Investigations and Civil Rights investigates violations of the law, particularly breach of trust by public employees and violations of civil rights:' The staff of Legal Services includes twenty-two deputy attorneys gen- eral in the Harrisburg Office, who are responsible for rendering legal serv- ices to administrative departments and agencies of State Government. In addition, a staff of attorneys is maintained throughout the Commonwealth and is generally assigned to larger counties where direct supervision from Harrisburg is impractical. Out of court activity constitutes the bulk of .the program's work. This includes drafting legislation, evaluating the constitutional, legal and other aspects of proposed legislation, as well as the preparation of legal opinions on existing statutes. The Crime Commission, established by Executive Order on March 27, 1967 as a part of the Legal Services Program, has been transferred to the new program of Criminal Justice. The budget provides nine additional positions at a cost of $55,000 for the Investigation and Civil Rights division of Legal Services. This staff will be used in the Governor's Branch Offices as field investigators and supporting clerical personnel. The field investigators will provide information on pos- sible problems that are developing, investigate complaints from the com- munity and attempt to establish close relations with local law enforcement officials.

Emphasis will also be placed on improv- ing local crime prevention programs and assisting local agencies in making applications for Federal funds. The program will include the Office of Criminal Justice, the Pennsyl- vania Crime Commission, and the Bureau of Criminal Justice Statistics. The major emphasis of the Office of Criminal Justice will be to give assistance to the 67 district attorneys of Pennsylvania. It will also develop recruitment and training programs for law enforcement officers. The Crime Commission's chief function will be to serve as a research and planning unit with regard to development and proposal of new legisla- tion dealing with crime and crime prevention. The Crime Commission presently reviews criminal justice legislation introduced in other public juris- dictions in an effort to seek the most innovative answers to the present crime situation. Initial major legislation will seek a new crime code, an all-em- bracing program in the area of juvenile crime, and a Police Salary, Training and Standards Act. In addition, the Crime Commission will collect compre- hensive criminal intelligence information with the emphasis on organized and professional crime. The Bureau of Criminal Justice Statistics will collect the data necessary for the effective operation of the Criminal Justice program. It will recom- mend the form and content of records which will be kept to insure the uni- form reporting of data to the Bureau and will process, tabulate, analyze and interpret the data collected.

The program operates eight correctional institutions. Philadelphia and Pittsburgh are maximum security institutions and handle the older or habitual offender. Huntingdon, Rockview, Graterford and Dallas are utilized as max- imum, medium and minimum security, as designated by the Commissioner of Corrections. Two specialized institutions are in operation\u2014Muncy for fe- male offenders, and Camp Hill for male juveniles. Diagnostic and classification centers are located at both Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. All convicted adult offenders are initially sent to one of these two centers where after diagnosis and evaluation, a program is recommended for each individual covering the educational, vocational and psychological treatment needed. A problem common to the vast majority of the inmate population is a lack of adequate education and skilled work experience. It is in these two areas that the process of rehabilitation focuses initially, and programs are pro- vided to upgrade the inmates capabilities, as far as possible, in these two areas. Correctional Industries, financed from the Manufacturing Fund, provides the basic manufacturing and farming work programs for the correctional institutions. There are 24 manufacturing centers, five food processing centers and six farms. An incentive or work recognition plan has been developed which entails basic job evaluations and progress increments for inmates as their skills increase. Vocational training is also provided in maintenance, construction and in the service fields. These assignments augment training received in the Cor- rectional Industries programs. From 1964 through 1967, the institutions issued 392 eighth grade certi- ficates', 191 tenth grade certificates, 419 eleventh grade certificates; 1,307 high school diplomas, 4,585 vocational certificates, 594 correspondence course cer- tificates and 423 other educational certificates. Medical, surgical and psychiatric care is provided by the institutions to correct physical defects that may hinder the ability of any inmate to par- ticipate fully in the institution's work and training programs. It also attempts to correct those defects which are disfiguring and may cause psychological maladjustments. The medical care program trains inmates as orderlies and as operating room, laboratory and x-ray technicians. The dental program in addition to providing for the dental care of inmates, provides similar training in dental technology at the Correctional Institution at Philadelphia. The State Correctional Institution at Camp Hill provides an intensive program for rehabilitation of the youthful offender between the ages of 15 and 21. Extensive opportunities are provided for both elementary and secondary education. Vocational training programs are provided and include auto- mobile repair, metal shop, printing, electrical repair, barbering, bricklaying, plumbing, welding, carpentry, furniture manufacture, coffee and tea prepara- tion, typewriter repair, office practices and the use of office equipment. Mobile forestry conservation camps are attached to the institutions at Camp Hill, Huntingdon, Rockview, and Graterford. These camps provide an alternative to institutional confinement and function to some degree as a pre- release program for those inmates whose progress in the institution shows that they are able to work in a less regimented environment. A total of $389,134 is budgeted to initiate a Regional Correctional Facil- ities program to provide treatment, care, maintenance, employment and re- habilitation for offenders now serving sentences of six months or more in county jails. Regional facilities will help to establish more integration and coordination of State and local service, and will permit the creation of more complete rehabilitation and training programs. Negotiations are underway '115 1 Justice for the purchase of the Westmoreland County Prison which will serve as the Southwest Regional Correctional Facility. Pre-release centers are to be established by Corrections as a method of providing a transition for its inmates between the institution and return to the community. They are to be centered in urban areas and will provide work-release and special treatment progams to aid the individual in the cru- cial period that usually follows upon release. Counseling and treatment are particularly effective in this situation because both the inmate and the cor- rectional staff must deal with realities actually encountered. The institution still has control over the inmate and is able to review the inmates reactions, deal with problems, and help the inmate in adjusting to a new environment. If the inmate shows inability to adjust, parole plans can be adjusted ac- cordingly. Three centers are now planned for Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Harris- burg. Each will house 15 inmates. The Bureau of Corrections has advanced its plans and hopes to open these three centers in 1968-69. The $215,000 will provide for a full years' operation in 1969-70. An additional mobile forestry camp will be added at a cost of $135,000 to provide an alternative to the usual close custody of institutionalization for those inmates with satisfactory records of progress. They allow more em- phasis on communal living and the advantages of small groups for treatment. The program is tied to the State's conservation agencies and work is done in State Forests, Parks, Fish, Game and Historical Commission lands and prop- erties. The program serves to help in the development of these State owned forests and parks and to improve timber resources in Pennsylvania, while providing a less restrictive environment for the rehabilitation of inmates. This proposed camp will be the seventh forestry camp maintained by correctional institutions and will be tied to either one of the institutions or to the proposed regional jail. This follows the plan of eventually establishing 10 forestry camps.

Act No. 147 of July 2, 1968 transferred the Juvenile Probation Grant Program from the Department of Public Welfare to the Juvenile Court Judges' Commission. During 1969-70 the Commission will implement a plan for the profession- alization of county juvenile probation services by bringing salary levels more in line with the State's probation services and with similar professional services in the county. The program will also support training to improve the quality of county juvenile probation services. Along with the salary raise will be implementation of a job classification system and job tenure. These changes will greatly help the counties in ef- fectively meeting their responsibilities in the area of juvenile probation. A total of $840,000 is budgeted to implement the salary increases and training programs and to continue earlier aid programs to the counties.

This grant assures compensation to certain individuals who are totally disabled due to an occupational disease as provided under the Occupational Disease Law. Through this grant, administered by the Workmen's Com- pensation program, the Commonwealth helps alleviate the economic hard- ships facing many citizens unable to work due to certain occupational diseases, principally silicosis and silica-related diseases. Under the Occupational Disease Act as amended, eligible claimants can receive regular payments up to $50 per week, not to exceed an aggregate sum of $12,750. Claimants who have exhausted regular benefits or were ex- cluded from regular benefits by certain statutory time limitations are paid $75 per month for life retroactive to the date of disability or the effective date of the enabling legislation (December, 1965), whichever occurs later. As of June 30, 1968, there were 21,429 persons receiving the monthly pension payment. During the 1968-69 fiscal year, approximately 4,300 per- sons will be added to the pension payroll thereby alleviating the backlog of claims in the processing system, and in 1969-70, processing of claims will be on a current basis.

Services provided by this program include physical restoration, counsel- ing, guidance, training, and ultimate placement in gainful activity. Also provided are medical treatment, prosthetic appliances, and initial equipment required for establishment of small businesses. The number of persons rehabilitated and placed in satisfactory employ- ment was 6,235 in fiscal year 1961. This effort has been improved each year, resulting in the rehabilitation of 14,091 persons in the 1967-68 fiscal year. This accomplishment represents the seventh consecutive year in which Penn- sylvania led all states in the nation in the number of handicapped persons prepared for and placed in gainful employment. The Federal government currently contributes to this program on a 75-25 per cent basis. During 1969-70, the Federal contribution will increase to 80 per cent, and the State share will decrease to 20 per cent. The proposed budget will enable the program to expand its services to the socially and culturally disadvantaged. This expanded program will be financed on a 90 per cent Federal and 10 per cent State basis during 1969-70. Source of Funds (Dollar Amounts In Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Increase Expend.

Through the program, the department plans and coordinates all mining restoration projects, prepares certain projects for submittal to the Appa- lachian Regional Commission, performs the engineering and survey work needed in project preparation, and prepares work and materials specifications prior to advertising for bids. In addition, this program maintains a small labor force and related equipment with which actual restoration on small or emergency projects is conducted. The recommended increase for Mining Area Restoration will allow re- placement of six bulldozers, two hi-lifts, a trailer, and a payloader. The Department's replacement schedule for heavy equipment has been delayed for the past three years due to lack of funds. Since repair costs are now in excess of the value of the equipment, it must be replaced. The increase also provides technical staff for the oil and gas well plugging program.

The total restoration program is financed from the General Fund, Fed- .eral augmentations for Appalachia projects, and the $500,000,000 Land and Water Development Fund. In addition to these sources, limited restoration is financed from forfeited performance bonds posted by strip mine operators. The Department's restoration activities include the following general -.types of projects: 1. Sealing and flushing abandoned coal mines to close openings and to fill voids in abandoned deep mines to prevent surface subsisdence; drainage control of flooded mines; and eliminating the public hazard of open mine shafts. 2 Strip mine restoration to backfill abandoned strip mines and to re- vegetate the restored area, prevent pollution from flooded pits, and generally to return the land to useful purposes. 3. CuIm bank fire control projects to extinguish, or control the spread of fires in culm or refuse banks to eliminate the hazard of escaping gasses, control air pollution, and return the land to . useful purposes. 138 1 Mines and Mineral Industries 4.

The State Library is the focal point of library services provided by the Commonwealth. It coordinates a Commonwealth-wide system of local, regional, and district libraries, determines the disbursement of State funds to libraries of the system, provides consultation to local libraries on ad- ministrative matters and sets standards based on State requirements. This program administers the Library Services Program described under Grants and Subsidies. There are a number of factors which will increase the need for addi- tional emphasis of the State's program of library services. There will be an increase in the population which uses library facilities. Also accelerated high school programs and the expansion of college enrollments will make increased demands upon the program. Other factors include increases in leisure time, and research programs by government and independent groups. 161 Public Instruction Source of Funds Federal Funds: Federal Funds for Administration of Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Edu- cation Act of 1965, Financial Assistance to Local Educational Agencies for the Education of Children of Low-Income Families\u2014Grants administered appear (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Expend.

This includes carrying forward the cost of the faculty pay increase granted in 1968-69. An amount of $4,775,024 has been included in the recommended appro- priation for new and expanded undergraduate programs, and it is distributed among the colleges and university on the basis of current full-time under- graduate enrollments. This is part of a program which will provide $10,000,000 in total to the State-owned Colleges and University, the State-related Uni- versities and to Drexel Institute of Technology, to improve undergraduate education in the Commonwealth. The use of these funds will be approved by the Superintendent of Public Instruction on a categorical grant basis. To qualify for the use of these funds, each institution will be required to sub- mit a plan to the Department of Public Instruction for its new and/or ex- panded undergraduate programs. The Superintendent of Public Instruction will approve programs which meet standards that will be established by the Department.

The Pennsylvania State Oral School for the Deaf at Scranton provides a program of instruction for approximately 150 deaf children from the nurs- sery school level through high school. A variety of programs are offered, including academic preparation, courses in physical education, home eco- nomics, arts and crafts, drafting, woodworking, metalcraft, printing, library science, ceramics and business practices. The recommended appropriation for the Oral School will provide for carrying forward programs at the cur- rent level, including an enrollment increase of approximately 10 children. Scotland School for Veterans' Children provides a home life and ele- mentary and secondary school education for approximately 540 sons and daughters of soldiers, sailors, and marines who served in World Wars I and II, and the Korean conflict. The objectives of this program are to de- velop the children into good citizens and. to provide them, with appropriate 170 Public Instruction academic and vocational training. The, budget recommendation provides for carrying forward present programs with an increasing emphasis on aca- demic instruction since greater numbers of the school's graduates have op- portunity to attend college, and an enrollment increase of 14 students.

BASIC INSTRUCTION The amount recommended for the basic instruction subsidy provides for the implementation of Act 96 which becomes effective following the declara- tion by the Senate and the House of Representatives by concurrent reso- lution that sufficient funds are available for the increased cost. The increase in the cost of the basic instruction subsidy as the result of Act 96 is estimated to be $130,000,000. The breakdown of the cost of the subsidy as amended by Act 96 is as follows: Basic Instruction $640,304,000 Density Factor 47,297,000 Sparsity Factor 7,210,000 Guarantee 2,995,000 Poverty Factor 32,749,000 Low Instruction Expense 905,000 Migratory Children 17,000 Total $731,477,000 The estimated payments are based on a formula, included in the law, which takes into account the districts' financial resources and allows higher payments to districts which are densely or sparsely populated or which are characterized by a high incidence of poverty. The payments are computed as follows: Base Subsidy Payment. This subsidy is designed to pay, on the average, 50% of a school district's basic instruction expenses. A sliding formula is used so that districts with the lowest real estate values per student receive the largest percentage of State aid. The amount paid to each district is deter- mined as follows: A X number of pupils X district aid ratio .= State share of district cost. where under the present law A = actual expense per pupil or $400 per pupil, whichever is less or under Act 96 A = actual expense per pupil or $550 per pupil, whichever is less and /district market valuation per WADM ) District Aid Ratio = 1 X .50 statewide market valuation per WADM The district market valuation is the value of taxable real property within a school district as determined by the State Tax Equalization Board. WADM stands for Weighted Average Daily Membership and represents the weighted resident pupils in average daily membership. Resident pupils are weighted .5 for a kindergarten pupil, 1 for an elementary pupil, and 1.36 for a high school pupil. Sparsity or Density Payment. This provides additional subsidy payments to districts with a population density of 10,000 or more people per square mile, or with a population density of 50 or less people per square mile. The sparsity and density factors have the following effect on a district's base subsidy payment: Provides reimbursement of expenditures in excess of $400 but not ex- ceeding an aid ratio of at least .375. Any district that qualifies for payments on account of sparsity may elect to receive an amount determined by multiplying $30 X the weighted average daily membership in lieu of reimbursement for expenditures in excess of $400. An additional payment for density factor is made to those districts with a WADM in excess of 50,000. That payment shall amount to the actual cost of instruction per WADM multiplied by 15% and by the WADM of the district. 1 172 Public Instruction Guarantee Payment. This allows school districts to receive the greater of their total subsidy calculated under the basic instruction subsidy Act 580 ap- proved February 1, 1966 or their total subsidy calculated under the previous legislation which was replaced by Act 580. It also provides that districts qualifying under sparsity or density may receive at least $30 per pupil in addition to their base subsidy. Poverty Payment. This provides subsidy payments to districts on account of poverty at the rate of $90 for each child in the district aged 5 through 17 from impoverished families. Under Act 96 this payment increases to $120. Low Instruction Expense. Act 96 further provides that payments be made to those districts which spend less than $400. This payment is determined by multiplying WADM X $400 less the sum of the base subsidy plus poverty plus 12.38 mills X the market value of the district. Children of Migrant Laborers. The school districts receive $1 per day of attendance by children of migrant laborers. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 1. State and Federal subsidies are paid to school districts for vocational curricula as follows: a. $35 per pupil in agriculture and industrial education b. $20 per pupil in home economics c. $50 per pupil in distributive education d. $75 or additional cost per pupil, whichever is less, for each pupil at- tending an area vocational technical school e. Grants for programs and equipment f. Reimbursement to districts for 80% of travel expenses of vocational education teachers and coordinators g. Reimbursements to districts for 80%) of salaries (not to exceed $4.00 per hour) of teachers and supervisors of vocational extension classes. 2. State and Federal funds are provided for salaries and expenses of vo- cational teacher education programs at State-owned and State-related col- leges and universities. 3. Federal funds are provided for construction of area vocational educa- tion facilities and for Federal Work Study programs. 4. Advance payments are made to county boards of school directors for current operations of area vocational-technical schools. MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT The purpose of the Manpower Development subsidy is to assist the school districts to meet matching requirements for Federal grants received for man- power development and training programs. The Federal government pro- vides 90% of the funds for such programs under the Federal Manpower De- velopment and Training Act of 1962. The objective of this act is to provide occupational training for unemployed and/or underemployed persons. Train- ing programs are limited to 104 weeks in duration and may be provided in any non-professional occupation in which a trainee may reasonably expect to find employment. Basic education training, if required, is also included in these programs. RENTALS AND SINKING FUND REQUIREMENTS The Rentals and Sinking Fund Requirements appropriation provides re- imbursement for a portion of school district capital expenses. These man- dated payments are made by the Commonwealth for rentals paid to building authorities for approved leases, sinking fund obligations, building site costs and construction costs. The State reimburses school districts for a share of their annual ap- proved rental charges if school buildings are financed and constructed by the State Public School Building Authority, a municipal or school district au- 173 Public Instruction thority, a profit or nonprofit corporation, a partnership, an association, or an individual. Sinking fund charges on a school district's general obligation indebtedness are also eligible for the State subsidy if the obligation was in- curred on account of buildings for which the general construction contract was awarded on or after March 22, 1956. The approved cost of acquiring and grading the land and the interest on such costs in addition to the reim- bursable cost of constructing the school building are included in this subsidy. For densely populated districts (districts having a population in excess of 10,000 per square mile) a minimum school building subsidy of 50% of the approved cost is guaranteed. By law, the reimbursement for technical institutes and area vocational technical schools cannot be less than 50% of the approved sinking funds charge or rental. The Rentals and Sinking Fund Requirements subsidies are presently calculated through a sliding formula which provides smaller percentage re- imbursements to richer districts (in terms of taxable real estate value): State's share =_ A x CARF where Ar-District's authority rental or sinking fund expenditures on approved site acquisition and building construction costs and CARF $4,500\u2014District Market Value per Teaching Unit x 004 \"'= $4,500 *Capital Accounts Reimbursement Fraction. A district teaching unit is equal to 30 elementary or 22 secondary pupils in average daily membership. Each pupil attending kindergarten sessions of 2.5 hours or more per day is weighted as one pupil. The $4,500 is an ar- bitrary amount per classroom unit set by law which is used as the basis for calculating the reimbursement fraction. There are limitations to reimbursable school construction which are based on specified amounts times pupil capacity. These are $1,600 per elementary pupil, $2,300 per secondary school pupil, and $3,000 for vocational and technical school and technical institute pupils. The 1969-70 recommended appropriation for Rentals and Sinking Fund Requirements includes $24,315,000 to implement the provision of Act 96, Session of 1968, which changes the formula for calculation of the subsidy payments. Act 96 raises the maximum per pupil capacity reimbursable cost by $700, changes the reimbursement factor from the capital account reim- bursement fraction to the aid ratio, and provides a grandfather clause. This section of Act 96 becomes effective upon concurrent resolution of the Senate and House of Representatives. PUPIL TRANSPORTATION The Transportation appropriation provides reimbursement for a portion of school district pupil transportation costs. Payments are currently made in the following manner: 1. Districts receive an amount for bussing costs which is computed by multiplying the approved costs (including the bussing of non-public students over established routes) times the district aid ratio. 2. Payments are made for depreciation on school buses owned by districts. 3. Payments are made in lieu of transportation costs for the board and lodging costs of special pupils. This payment is computed by mul- tiplying the authorized board and lodging costs times the district aid ratio. The 1969-70 recommended amount provided for transportation payments as authorized by present law plus $6,309,000 for increased transportation payments under Act 96. This provision of Act 96 requires payment of all reimbursable costs in excess of one-half mill times market value. SPECIAL EDUCATION The Special Education appropriation provides payments to school districts and county boards for the additional cost of educating exceptional children in special classes. Exceptional children are defined as children who differ from the \"average\" in physical, mental, emotional, or social characteristics including all children in detention homes. Reimbursements to the school 1 174 Public Instruction districts are calculated by multiplying the number of special class pupils times the instruction cost per special class pupil minus the instruction cost per regular class pupil. HOMEBOUND INSTRUCTION The Homebound Instruction appropriation provides payments to school districts on account of the instruction of homebound children. The amount to each district is determined by multiplying the mandated minimum hourly rate for instructing homebound children ($4.00) by the district's aid ratio. AID TO FINANCIALLY HANDICAPPED SCHOOL DISTRICTS The Aid to Financially Handicapped School Districts appropriation is to provide grants at the discretion of the Superintendent of Public Instruction to financially insolvent school districts. TUITION FOR ORPHANS AND CHILDREN PLACED IN PRIVATE HOMES The Tuition for Orphans and Children Placed in Private Homes appro- priation provides reimbursement to school districts for the education of non- resident orphans or foster children who are placed by the court in homes or institutions in the given district and attend school there. The amount per district is computed by multiplying the number of non-resident, institutional- ized, or orphaned children times the approved district tuition charge per pupil. PAYMENT IN LIEU OF TAXES The Payments in Lieu of Taxes appropriation provides payments to school districts in lieu of taxes to which they are deprived due to purchase by the Commonwealth of land for water conservation or flood control. The amount per district is computed by multiplying the current school tax rate on private property times the assessed value at the time of acquisition by the State. EDUCATION OF MIGRANT LABORERS' CHILDREN The Education of Migrant Laborer's Children appropriation provides re- imbursements to the school districts for the cost of conducting summer classes for children of migrant workers.

The recommended aid is $.25 per capita for local libraries, $.125 for the college and university district library centers, and $.25 for the district library centers other than the colleges and universities. This is the maximum aid provided in the Library Code of 1961. The categories of aid are as follows: State-Aid to Local Libraries. The Library Code authorizies aid to local libraries on a per capita basis for service population. The budget reccommen- dation includes $2,250,000 for aid to approximately 350 local libraries servic- ing over 8,900,000 people. State-Aid to County Libraries. The Library Code provides for aid to each county library up to $8,000. The budget recommendation includes $270,000 to provide aid to approximately 40 county libraries. State-Aid to District Library Centers. State aid is authorized for each of 30 district library centers at a rate of $.25 per capita for each person in each district outside of its local service area. The budget recommendation includes $1,925,155 which provides $.25 per capita aid for an eligible popula- tion of 7,700,620. State-Aid to Regional Library Resource Centers. State aid is authorized for each of four libraries designated as regional library resource centers in the maximum amount of $100,000 each. The budget recommendation in- cludes $400,000 which provides for a grant of $100,000 each to the regional library resource centers which are the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, the Free Library of Philadelphia, the Pennsylvania State University Library, and the Pennsylvania State Library. Equalization Aid. This provides additional aid to libraries located in areas with low real estate values. This aid is authorized to libraries in whose service areas the product of 1/2 mills times per capita market value is less than $1.25. The budget recommendation includes $370,000 which will provide equalization aid for 125 libraries. Under this program, Federal funds for the construction of new libraries and improvement of library services are distributed to State-owned and State-aided institutions. A total of $1,448,997 will be distributed in 1969-70. This program also provides State funds to the Free Library of Phila- delphia and to the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh to meet the costs of serving as regional libraries in the distribution of blind reading materials and talking books. It will be extended to include services to individuals who are unable to use books because of physical limitations other than blind- ness; $403,346 in State funds is recommended for this extension of services. This will be used in conjunction with $30,766 in Federal funds which will provide special devices such as ceiling projectors, page turners, and prism spectacles for those having physical limitations other than blindness.

Grants are made on the basis of medical, scholarship, and financial data submitted by the applicants. The funds are used to defray expenses of tuition, maintenance, instructional fees, books, readers' services, and transportation. Also under this program, funds are provided to nonsectarian institu- tions for the education of blind children under eight years of age. Payments are made up to a maximum of $3 per pupil per day. Funds are provided to pay a portion of the tuition maintenance costs of institutionalized residents of Pennsylvania who are deaf, blind, cerebral palsied, brain damaged, muscular dystrophied, or emotionally disturbed. These pupils are eligible if they attend approved schools within Pennsylvania or out-of-state. For children between 6 and 21 years of age, the Common- wealth pays 75% of the costs and the school district in which the child resides pays 25% of the costs. The Commonwealth pays all costs for children less than 6 and more than 21 years of age. In no case shall the Commonwealth's payment exceed 75% of $3,500 per individual per year. The maximum amount payable in the case of emotionally disturbed children is 75% of $1,500. 177 Public Instruction Source of Funds: (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Expend. 1 Increase Decrease 3 3,863 11,878 \u2014560 $3,298 Appropriations: Higher Education of Blind or Deaf Students $ 35 Education of Blind Students 3 Education of Deaf, Blind, and Cerebral Palsied 8,015 Education of Deaf, Blind and Cerebral Palsied\u2014Recommended Deficiency 560 Total $8,613 Supervision of Public Schools 1 (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 State Funds Estimated Expend. $3,715 Increase Decrease $692 Budget $4,407 This program provides for the payment of salaries and other expenses of employes of Officers of County Superintendents of Schools and County Boards of School Directors.

The option period closes December 1969. 178 1 Public Instruction This program also includes the State's portion of the annuity payable to school employes at the time of their retirement. The State guarantees sufficient interest on invested funds to provide the annunities as set up to the credit of the employes. The State also provides for a share of retirement costs for the faculty of the State Colleges and the State-owned universities. The State also provides a retirement allowance to former teachers, 62 years of age or older, who taught in the Commonwealth's public schools for at least 20 years prior to 1919 or for 14 years in the case of thOse retiring because of disability. Supplemental retirement benefits are provided to certain annuitants of the Public School Employes' Retirement System, guaranteeing a minimum of $65 for each year of accredited service, not to exceed $2,600 for 40 years of service. These benefits were made permanent by Act No. 34 which also provided for a cost of living increase for those annunitants who retired prior to 1965.

These scholarships were awarded on a competitive basis by county and senatorial district. This program was terminated by law effective August 31, 1967. However, students presently receiving scholarships will remain eligible until graduation. The budget recommendation provides for 183 scholarships of $200 each and 200 of $250 each. The Commonwealth's scholarship and loan program is administered through the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency. It provides scholarships to qualified students of the Commonwealth who need financial assistance to attend post secondary institutions of higher learning, and guaran- tees loans made for the purpose of assisting residents in meeting their ex- penses of higher education. Matching funds are provided to assist students in securing grants and loans from the Federal government. The $60,000,000 recommended appropriation will provide awards for the students now receiving scholarships and for the award of scholarships to 18,200 additional students in 1969-70. An appropriation for reserve for guaranteed loans will not be required in 1969-70 because sufficient funds are available in the Higher Education Assistance Fund for 1969-70 loan guarantees and because the Federal gov- ernment now has a reinsurance program which reduces the necessity for using State funds to guarantee loans. The recommended Student Aid Funds-Matching appropriation will enable approximately 60,000 students in Pennsylvania colleges and universities to obtain loans and grants from the Federal government in 1969-70.

The Commonwealth also pays one half of each college's approved capital expenses. The long range objective of this program is to establish 25 to 30 institu- tions which would serve more than 76,000 youth and adults by 1978. At the It It It II II 181 Public Instruction present time there are 12 community colleges with a total of 14 campuses in Pennsylvania. It is anticipated that after 1968 one to three community colleges will commence operation each year providing a steady but realistic growth pattern to a maximum of 25 to 30. Enrollment at the community colleges is expected to increase in the following manner: Part Time Full Time capital appropriations provide the State's share of projected 1969-70 costs at the 12 community colleges now in operation and \"start-up\" costs for 5 new community colleges which will be sufficiently completed to enroll students beginning in 1970-71.

This is accomplished through enforcement of the Public Utility Law and promulgation of regula- tions adopted by the Commission. Administrative and operational activities of the Commission are financed through an appropriation from the General Fund for both general govern- ment operations and grade crossing protection. However, the Commission recovers approximately 95 per cent of its administrative expenditures through general assessment on utilities. 1 GENERAL GOVERNMENT Executive and Administrative (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 State Funds Complement Estimated Expend. $1,388 143 Increase Decrease Budget $ 167 $1,555 143 The Executive program includes the office of the Commissioners, the Secretary, and the various administrative services including personnel, fiscal, procurement and public relations in addition to the Legal Bureau.

Program activities in- clude auditing approximately 800 non-transportation and 5,000 transportation utility annual financial reports to determine if rates charged are justified and reasonable, conducting some 40 field examinations of utility accounting facil- ities for conformance to utility accounting regulations, reviewing and process- ing approximately 19,000 tariff changes and 1,400 changes in transportation services, registering securities certificates and confirming insurance coverage. 189 Public Utility In addition, the bureau reviews utility accident reports and conducts field examinations of railroad crossings and railroad safety conditions as part of its Grade Crossing Protection program described under Grants and Sub- sidies. The appropriation for this program will enable its activities to be con- tinued at the current level. The new personnel will be trained -in positions requiring knowledge of a highly technical nature in an effort to: replenish the loss of these skills in recent years through loss of key employes.

This assures Commonwealth citizens of safe, adequate and continuous services within charges as permitted by law. . Enforcement is provided through the annual testing of approximately 500 metering instruments used by utilities, investigating approximately 4,000 property carrier motor vehicles, investigating 575 accident reports of non- transportation utilities, and by review of 2,500 informal and 360 formal com- plaints.

Services are provided directly through administration of program serv- ices and indirectly through programs of standard setting, regulation, super- vision, licensing, grants, subsidies, and purchase of services. The Public Welfare System is headed by a Secretary who is served by an Advisory Public Welfare Board. The Secretary is assisted by a Deputy Secretary for Public Welfare who provides program development, coordina- tion, planning, and auxiliary services and a Deputy Secretary for manage- ment who provides administrative and supporting services. Program planning, evaluation and leadership is provided through a Deputy for Mental Health and Retardation, a Commissioner for Family Services and a Commissioner for Medical Services and Facilities. The actual delivery of services is executed through regional offices. The State's share of funds required for the operation of the Department and the provision of welfare services comes from General Fund Appropria- tions. Federal funds are contributed to support 20 programs among which are Public Assistance, Medical Assistance, Mental Health, and Child Welfare Services. Other receipts include funds from counties, payments from patients or third parties, grants from private foundations, and miscellaneous reimbursements.

The Secretary through his Deputy for Public Welfare develops new programs, performs program research, co- ordinates program services and professional staff development and produces public educational materials to interpret the department's programs and ob- jectives to the general public, employees of the Department and consumers of service. Through the Deputy for Management, the Secretary assures the pro- vision of management support services to the entire Department. The serv- III 11 II II 193 Public Welfare ices include analytical staff assistance to agency management and coordina- tion of all resource planning efforts; maintenance of a data collection and management information system; maintenance of a fiscal program designed to maximize the effective, efficient and economic utilization of funds available to the Department; maintenance of personnel and manpOwer development activity and administrative services including data processing, procurement, finance, office services, and the coordination of institutional maintenance, construction and operational activities. This office is faced with the problem of supporting programs which are growing in size and complexity. Methods and practices which were previously satisfactory are becoming obsolete and are in need of restudy, simplification and improvement. In recognition of the. constant ' need for improvement, five specific objectives are currently being emphasized: 1. Perfection of the operation of regional offices. \u2014 2. Development of a planning, programming, budgeting capability:. ?3. .. Mechanizing those functions which by reason of volume and repetitive actions require an exorbitant amount of manpower and time to provide prompt service to the public and adequate data for manage- ment purposes. 4. Providing program support on a more efficient current basis. 5. Providing program development and special program services. All five Major objectives require additional staffing and equipment. There are field personnel throughout the State responsible to and coordinated by different central program offices. Studies have shown the need for regional coordinating offices. Personnel are needed to perform and co- ordinate the programs of the Department and to extend the services formerly provided to only a part of the departmental programs. In the case of mechan- ization, the equipment is available but personnel are needed to man additional shifts and contractual services are needed to design the systems and pro- gram the computer. In other areas, more modern and efficient equipment is needed in addition to a limited number of personnel. The 1969-70 recommended budget provides for the establishment of five additional regional offices, improved planning and program development ca- pability, and management improvements through computer applications.

In order to accomplish this objective, the office provides the following services: PUBLIC ASSISTANCE SERVICES: Administers the Public Assistance Services (see Grants and Subsidies\u2014Assistance Payments and County Ad- ministration). SERVICES FOR THE AGING: Promotes community programs and low- cost housing for the aging; establishes standards for foster care placement and supervises placement agencies; establishes standards and licenses day- care centers for adults; contracts with the John J. Kane Hospital for con- ducting institutes for training nursing home personnel; administers a program of grants to political subdivisions for programs for the elderly (see Grants and Subsidies\u2014Grants to Communities for Services for the Aging). 1 1 1 194 10 Public Welfare ID II II - The elderly population of 65 and over is expanding and will total 1,500,000 in 1970, an increase of 372,000 over 1960. Communities are requesting State help, and are increasingly supporting programs for the aged such as housing, hot meals, foster care, day care, and health services. In 1967-1968, consultation was provided to officials in 49 counties, in- kmlying 205 agencies and organizations. Training programs were arranged for program personnel participating in the programs receiving State' and Federal grants-in-aid from the Department. SERVICES FOR THE VISUALLY HANDICAPPED: Conducts a pro- gram of public education regarding eye health, eye safety, and prevention of blindness; rehabilitates industrially blinded and other visually handicapped persons by giving them vocational diagnosis, medical treatment, occupa- tional training and placement services (see Grants and Subsidies\u2014Subsidies for the Blind); provides home teaching services to the adult blind; estab- lishes the eligibility of potential recipients of State aid; maintains and supervises vending stand units operated by the blind; conducts research and establishes and improves workshops and rehabilitative facilities. Requests for services have grown from 15,000 in 1965-1966 to an esti- mated 23,000 in 1968-1969 and are expected to be 27,500 in 1969-1970. Eleven teachers provide 3,500 lessons in Braille, home management, communication and crafts. There are almost 200 snack bars operated by blind persons, with sales of $5,000,000 and average net earnings for the operators of $100 a week. There is a backlog of 1,000 cases needing rehabilitation services. SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH: Stimulates the develop- ment of Child Welfare Services in local communities and supervises all child welfare and youth activities carried on by the Department; supervises or licenses public and private institutions, agencies, and day-care centers for dependent, neglected and delinquent children and youth: administers a grant program to counties to defray part of the cost of Child Welfare Serv- ices; administers the subsidy payment of one-half the operating costs of two institutions for delinquent juveniles\u2014Glen Mills School and Sleighton Farm School; administers the grant program for juvenile crime prevention and im- proved police services (see Grants and Subsidies\u2014Family Services); admin- isters a day care program for children of migrant workers; carries out Penn- sylvania's responsibilities under the Interstate Compact on Juveniles and under the Importation Act; approves agencies for use of the relinquishment and abandonment provisions of the Adoption Law; administers a Neighbor- hood Youth Corps Program for economically disadvantaged youth; super- vises the administration of Youth Development Centers, a Youth Develop- ment Day Treatment Center, and Youth Forestry Camps (see General Gov- ernment\u2014Institutional). County child welfare agencies provide child welfare services to 106,000 children each year. The services authorized and utilized have expanded since a change in the County Code in 1961 that enabled counties to aid children at home and not just in foster homes or institutions, as previously prescribed. New Congressional mandates require child welfare services for all 216,000 children receiving public assistance, or e potential doubling of need and services. As agencies expand, office field staff is called on for increased help and consultative services. In summary, the Family Services Program must be strengthened to meet the increased demands for services and the growing complexity of the pro- grams. Coordination of local public service programs for children, increased emphasis on social services in Assistance programs, and growing awareness of the needs of the aging for social services impose greater demands on the staff services. Similarly, services for handicapped persons must be coordinated with other programs and must be extended. New programs must be conceived and put into effect on experimental and pilot basis. The Department has now combined at the State level, the various pro- grams for the aging, child welfare, public assistance, and the rehabilitation of the blind into one viable and coordinated office. The next step, which will require legislation, is to combine child welfare services at the local level. II II 195 Public Welfare The goal is not simply to insure a higher degree of coordination in the pro- /vision of rehabilitative social services but, rather, to use services to help people to achieve independent living and to realize their highest possible potential. The 1969-70 budget provides additional professional and technical staff to meet increased workloads in the various programs for the Aging, Child Welfare, Public Assistance Casework, and services to the Visually Handi- capped.

This program develops policies for the medical assistance program which pays medical costs for the indigent (see Grants and Subsidies) and reim- burses hospitals for longterm care for the indigent (see Grants and Subsidies); operates a system of inpatient and outpatient medical services through the operation of ten State-owned general hospitals and two restoration centers (see General Government\u2014Institutional); establishes standards, supervises or licenses all general hospitals and other related health care facilities in- cluding nursing homes; reviews plans for the construction of all hospital and medical facilities and supervises federally-aided construction. STANDARDS AND SUPERVISION: In order to insure high quality medical care the Medical Services and Facilities program continues to carry out the basic functions of supervision and consultation service for 295 gen- eral hospitals in Pennsylvania. As of June 30, 1968, the office was responsible for the inspection of these facilities with a capacity of 56,469 medical and surgical beds and 6,318 bassinets. In the general hospital field, 421 inspec- tion visits were made. In 1963, some 209 hospitals were accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals. Presently 221 hospitals are accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation. There are also 17 hospitals accredited by the American Osteopathic Association. Of the 57 hospitals which are not accredited there are 31 technically eligible for accreditation and 27 which are not eligible because of size or other factors. In 1968 there were 262 general hospitals certified for participation in the Federal Medicare Program. Pennsylvania's population in 1960 included 1,128,523 persons aged 65 or over. By 1970 we anticipate an aged population of approximately 1,500,000. The steady growth in the trend toward institutionalization for the aged calls for additional supervision of the 1,054 institutions caring for over 100,000 aged persons. There are also approximately 115 new institutions, now under construction or planned, to care for more than 11,000 additional aged persons in long-term nursing home facilities. The office now licenses 421 proprietary nursing homes and surveys and approves 268 nonprofit institutions including 59 county institutions. There are 18,848 beds in proprietary nursing homes, 20,093 beds in nonprofit facil- ities and 10,240 beds in county institutions. During 1968, 14 new nursing homes were added providing 738 beds and 35 existing facilities provided 680 additional beds. This is a total of 1,418 new beds. 196 Increase Decrease $ 474 \u201426 Budget $ 939 565 $1,504 $ 448 Total - $1,056 Complement 132 6 138 The goal of the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Program is to insure the availability and accessability of appropriate care and treatment for every person in Pennsylvania who suffers from a mental disability.

Construction of new facilities was curtailed because satisfactory financing could not be secured. Thirty-one additional nursing homes have been certified for participation in Medicare as extended care facilities. This brings the total number to 228 and the total number of beds under Medicare to 16,606. Training seminars are being offered so that the State's function will not only be that of a critic through its role of licensing or approval but also that of a teacher and consultant to help these facilities achieve a high level of patient care. To ensure the availability and accessibility of medical and related facilities the Office continues to carry responsibility for administration of the Federal Hill-Burton program for construction and modernization of hos- pitals and medical care facilities. It is also responsible for the construction phase of other Federal-aided programs including mental health and mental retardation. The Office reviews and approves proposed construction in all general and special hospitals and nursing homes. The Office also has responsibilities in the area of community consulta- tion and planning. Public and private agencies are finding this consultative service a central source of information relating to programming medical care services and facilities. In 1960-1961 the Pennsylvania State Plan of medical facilities included an inventory of nearly 900 existing medical facilities; the 1968 State Plan includes an inventory of 1,253 facilities with a capacity of 96,525 beds. It is estimated that within the next five years Pennsylvania will need to expand the ca- pacity of general hospitals by 2,400 beds. Presently 57 hospitals have construction programs which will modernize services and substandard patient care areas affecting 3,832 existing beds as well as adding 1,726 new beds. Letters of intent for construction, received from local hospital and medical facilities requesting participation in the allocation of Hill-Burton funds for the current fiscal year total $288,000,000. The 1969-70 budget provides additional professional and technical staff to meet increased activities in Hill-Burton construction, to provide consulta- tion to hospitals, and to strengthen the State Medical Assistance program.

At present, care is available from all sources, both public and private, for only 235,000 persons. The Office of Mental Health operates 20 State-owned institutions for the mentally 'ill (see General Government\u2014Institutional); promotes the devel- opment of Community Mental Health Programs through the implementation of the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1966 (see Grants and Subsidies\u2014Community Services for the Mentally 111/Mentally Retarded); licenses and inspects private mental facilities and approves applications for the opening of new facilities; administers the Interstate Compact on Mental Health; administers a Community Mental Health facility construction pro- gram from funds allocated to the Commonwealth under the Federal Mental Health Center Construction Act; and conducts Mental Health Education and Consultation. In order to insure high quality care, the Office licenses and inspects annually 56 private psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric wards of general hospitals. Over 25,000 people with mental disabilities were treated and dis- charged from 78 general hospitals within their communities last year. More than 18,200 patients were treated in 39 general hospitals with psychiatric units. Some 6,832 were treated in another 39 general hospitals which lack special psychiatric units but which accept psychiatric patients. The Interstate Compact on Mental Health permits the interstate trans- fer of patients without regard to residence laws for the 35 signatory states. The remaining states still operate under residence laws in the transfer of mental patients. Approximately 30 mentally ill patients were transfered out of the State and 30 were transfered into the State under the terms of the Compact. An equal number were transferred under residence laws. Over 700 patients were transferred to facilities of the Veterans Administration. A new activity, brought about by the Mental Health and Mental Re- tardation Act of 1966, provides for the transfer, without court approval, of any person detained in a State Correctional Institution believed to be mentally disabled to the extent that his commitment to a State Mental Hospital is necessary or desirable. Last year was the third year of the Mental Health Center Construction Grant program with seven applications approved in Pennsylvania for a total of $10.8 million. Of this figure $2.7 million were Federal funds and $8.1 million local funds. The Office maintains a film library of approximately 900 films. These are distributed throughout the Commonwealth for use in educational settings. In addition, over 1,000 church and civic groups borrowed films. Printed ma- terial covering mental health and related facilities and service was available to supplement the use of films. The 1969-70 recommended budget provides for continuation of the pro- gram at the present level with a slight increase to provide professional staff for the additional Regional Offices.

Some 5%, or approximately 18,000 per- sons, require institutional care. The Office of Mental Retardation provides institutional care through nine State-owned schools and hospitals (see General Government-Institu- tions) caring for over 12,000 mentally retarded patients; purchases institu- tional care for some 577 patients at Elwyn Institute (see Grants and Sub- sidies-Elwyn Institute), and sets standards, inspects and licenses private facilities (now totalling 43 agencies), which provide interim care for some 1,600 mentally retarded persons awaiting admission to State schools. The program also subsidizes some 32 sheltered workshops, which accom- modate some 1,700 mentally retarded persons by providing meaningful em- ployment and rehabilitation for these individuals. The Office purchases day care services for about 500 mentally retarded persons, enabling parents to work or have a respite from the constant care of the patient (see Grants and Subsidies-Community Services for the Mentally Ill and Mentally Retarded). State care for about 14,000 mentally retarded individuals is provided as follows: Inpatients in State Institutions 12,000 Interim Care 1,600 Elwyn Institute 577 14,177 Another 1,700 in Sheltered Workshops and 500 in Day Care Centers receive rehabilitative services and day treatment at State expense.

The average length of stay is 9 to 12 months. The trend in the rate of juvenile commitments continued upward until mid-1967 when the number of commitments declined due to the decision of the U. S. Supreme Court concerning the legal rights of juveniles. The estimated institutional population trend is indicated below. Children Admitted Institutional Capacity Average Occupancy 89% The budget for the 1969-70 fiscal year reflects an adjustment to the re- duced requirements for bed space. Two institutions, Cresson and South Philadelphia, will be closed. The Warrendale institution will be operated at reduced capacity as an annex to the New Castle Youth Development Center. 200 Public Welfare During the 3969-70 fiscal year it is recommended that non-institutional services be provided and expanded. These services will include foster home placement for individuals and foster homes for groups of six to twenty chil- dren. This will enable the Department to expand services to additional chil- dren while reducing the need to construct additional bed space. This is a ifirst step in the development of a program which offers services to meet children's needs through means other than institutionalization. An objective of the Department is to provide a wider range of treat- ment services to delinquent children so that an institution becomes merely one part of a continuum of service to children.

Of these, 461 have been discharged either to their homes and relatives or to other placement facilities. In addition, the Armstrong County Memorial General Hospital, in Kit- tanning, has been acquired and will be renovated as a restoration center. Also, the General State Authority has contracted for design of a center at Altoona with land to be provided by the local redevelopment authority on the ground of the Altoona General Hospital. The Kittanning facility will provide approximately 185 beds and Altoona another 150 beds.

During the same time the number of out-patients increased from 8,300 to 20,000. With the development of community mental health centers and county plans it is anticipated that there will be a further decrease in the admission rate. There is a continued emphasis on the need for increased services for children and extensive development of treatment programs for alcohol and drug addiction. At the present time only one hospital has a formalized narcotic addition program, and one residential treatment facility is exclusively for emotionally disturbed children. However, several other State mental hospitals provide care, treatment, education and rehabilitation for children who are mentally disabled through specialized treatment programs and units. A few of the hospitals have organized adolescent treatment program units, but all admit and treat patients under 18 years of age. It is anticipated that within the next five years there will be a great need for increased quantity and quality of psychiatric services for children and it is predicted that there will be a 300 per cent increase in the formalized programmed activity for children's services by 1970. The mentally retarded constitute approximately 10 per cent of the large general psychiatric patient group and there is increasing need to provide the essential programming for their care, treatment, and rehabilitation in the psychiatric facilities that have been historically focused solely on the care of the mentally ill. Most of the hospitals operate large out-patient clinics in their local areas for the treatment of the mentally disabled. Eight have established out-patient clinics in the metropolitan areas they serve, and two hospitals operate day- care services'. One provides part-time staff for three community clinics and another maintains an extension office to provide pre-admission and after-care services. Nine have adjusted their patient population to the unit system, six on the basis of geographical units; two have established units for special kinds 1 1 204 Public Welfare of program or diagnostic categories, and one hospital makes assignments to three units at admission on the basis of date of admission. The majority of the remaining hospitals will have a type of unit system developed by 1974. Sub-programming in the hospitals is by geriatric, general psychiatric serv- ices, children-adolescent, alcoholic-drug addiction, and medical-surgical. The 659 new positions recommended include 406 to upgrade patient services. These additional positions are necessary to replace patient labor as the more able patients are rehabilitated and released. They are also needed to improve the number of professional staff available to treat and care for patients. An additional 253 new positions are needed for the in- troduction of new treatment techniques in the hospitals. These treatment programs are most important if the instituions are to continue to improve patient treatment. The use of modern treatment methods has proved to more than pay for itself by more quickly returning patients to their com- munities.

Increase Decrease Budget $60,345 Of the estimated 360,000 mentally retarded persons throughout the State, 18,000 require institutional care. This supports a major objective to raise the capacity for residenial care to the minimum standard of 150 beds per 100,000 population which, with a State population of 12.0 million persons, requires 18,000 beds. Another objective is to raise the quality of care in the institu- tions at least to the minimum standards set by the American Association for Mental Deficiency, and a patient-to-staff ratio of about 1.3 to 1. The current average ratio is about 1.7 to 1. To meet the standard would require 2,000 additional staff. A long range objective is to upgrade the residential facil- ities to meet modern program concepts and to deploy staff and services to function as a community of services to the surrounding area. The nine institutions for the mentally retarded currently are caring for more than 12,000 patients. Referrals for services are made through local child welfare agencies, the courts, physicians, community mental health/ 205 Ill Ill Ill Ill In Ill Ill lIE Nil II El Public Welfare mental retardation centers, diagnostic and evaluation centers and parents and relatives. There are 4,700 patients awaiting admission to State schools. Of this number, nearly 1,600 are being cared for in 43 private licensed facilities under the Interim Care for the Mentally Retarded Program (see Grants and Subsidies\u2014Community Services for the Mentally Ill and Mentally Retarded). Another 577 patients are being cared for at State expense at Elwyn Institute (see Grants and Subsidies\u2014Elwyn Institute). On the basis of the need for 18,000 beds in residential facilities as noted under objectives, it is evident that only some 14,000 are being cared for at this time. In addition, the current 12,000 inpatients in State schools represent 129 per cent of existing bed capacity. Current approved staffing for the State schools totals 7,155 or some 2,000 below the recommended levels for adequate patient care. These factors, along with the need for additional medical personnel at many of the facilities, limit the quantity and quality of services. The 1,097 new positions recommended are a large step toward providing the above mentioned 2,000 additional staff needed to reach minimum stand- ards for adequate patient care. Of the new positions recommended, 243 are needed to effectively staff new facilities. An additional 453 are recommended to increase the number of positions available to improve patient care and rehabilitation and an additional 401 new positions are recommended for the introduction of new rehabilitation techniques. It is only through the use of modern rehabilitative techniques that the mentally retarded can be pre- pared for a productive role in the community.

This is done through provision of outpatient diagnostic screening and dispositional planning. Other services include screening of adult mentally retarded, specialized services for brain damaged children, individual and family counseling and consultation, demographic studies and necessary day-care services. There are currently three area Diagnostic and Evaluation Centers\u2014East- ern at Philadelphia, Central at Selinsgrove, and Western at Pittsburgh. In- patient residential facilities to which patients are referred include the nine State Schools and Hospitals for the mentally retarded and one State School and Hospital for emotionally disturbed children. In addition, units or wards in the 18 State mental hospitals are utilized for children's programs. A total of 1,318 evaluations were processed during the fiscal year 1967-68, with esti- mated evaluations of 1,500 for the fiscal year 1968-69 and 2,500 for the fiscal year 1969-70. With the emerging Community Mental Health/Mental Retardation serv- ices and the additional outpatient and diagnostic functions to be performed by the State institutions, the role of the Centers as they currently exist is questionable. The services performed must be continued and expanded to accomplish the objective, however, the functions of the three Centers are expected to be merged into an appropriate institutional program as a part of the total community services for Mental Health and Mental Retardation.

To meet this objective the center carries out special mental health studies on population trends and movements, facilities avail- able and prevention of mental illness. It develops activities in community education, specialized counseling, alternative planning, after-care and public relations. The Eastern Mental Health Center maintains a reception and classifica- tion center for adults which is operated on a 24-hour basis for the reception, screening, classification, evaluation, diagnosis, treatment, transfer, redistribu- tion, rehabilitation, and follow-up of patients in the Philadelphia area. Pa- tients move from this center to all areas of State hospitals and to other private psychiatric facilities. Through care, diagnosis and evaluation the center eleminates long-term hospitalization in many cases. It also purchases services at the Mercy-Douglass and the University of Pennsylvania Hospitals for the care and treatment given to persons referred to them by the Center. Estimated admissions for the fiscal year 1969-70 are 2,500 patients. This reflects a 17 per cent decrease from the 1967-68 admissions. It is anticipated that by 1970, there will be complete coverage for central Philadelphia in terms of Mental Health/Mental Retardation services. Philadelphia was the first city in the country to take advantage of a recent Federal funds for construction and staffing of community mental health centers. The new Federally supported services, combined with the develop- ment of services under the 1966 Mental Health/Mental Retardation Act, enhance the development of services at the community level. Thus, the original purpose of establishing Eastern Mental Health Center will be superceded and the existing staff may then be diverted to meet specialized needs. Programs in alcoholism and drug addiction, short term services, and after care will further develop. By 1970 there will be a South Eastern Pennsylvania Regional Coordinat- ing Service for state, county and community mental health programs The South Eastern Regional Coordination Service will provide leadership, con- sultation, education, continuity, and coordination for the development of new mental health programs.

This program is a family-centered and community-based program for social rehabilitation and financial aid for the preservation of family life. Sixty-seven County Boards of assistance, functioning as State agencies, ad- minister public assistance grants, determine eligibility for food stamps, pro- vide social services and encourage job training. A variety of services are provided to help families solve their problems and achieve stable family lives in which they and their children can thrive. Emphasis is placed on rehabilitating all persons who need help to return to or be prepared for employment. Unemployment and continued poverty in the face of rising and long- sustained prosperity are due to lack of job skills, inadequate education, un- stable or inadequate work experience and discrimination. The special employment and training efforts of the Department attack these causes by helping persons obtain basic education, vocational skills, employment orien- tation, self-reliance and jobs. These efforts are carried out with the active cooperation of the Departments of Labor and Industry, Public Instruction, Community Affairs, Health, and local public and voluntary agencies and Federal agencies including the Departments of Labor, and Health, Education, and Welfare and the Office of Economic Opportunity.

Increase Decrease Budget State Funds 95,800 $376,662 The Cash Grants program is designed to help all eligible persons obtain a decent and healthful standard of living through direct cash assistance. During 1969-1970, an estimated monthly average of 432,100 persons will re- ceive such assistance and another estimated 4,000 persons in public medical institutions will receive an allowance for personal items. This represents a monthly increase of 22,500 over 1968-1969. The increase principally results from the effects of increasing allowances on January 1, 1969, and from a judicial decision holding Pennsylvania's Residence Law unconstitutional. The current allowances for assistance fall short of meeting the full amount necessary to achieve a minimum standard of living, based on a standard established about ten years ago. Beginning January 1, 1969 allow- ances were increased to meet 90 per cent of that standard. Also, at that time, monthly allowances for persons in the qualifying nursing homes were increased to $240 and $280 plus $5 for personal items. The 1969-70 recommended budget includes $22,350,000 in State funds to increase grants from 90% to 100% of the minimum standards for health and decency. 208 Complement 5,680 593 6,273 This program provides staff to determine eligibility to receive cash grants, medical assistance and food stamps, and provides the social services necessary to strengthen family life and help persons realize their maximum potential for sell-sufficiency.

The total staff is distributed by activity, as follows: Eligibility Determination, 3,153; Social Services, 2,277; Professional Education and Inservice Training, 130; Custodial, 120. The cash grants increases will correspondingly increase the workload in county offices, necessitating additional staff. To handle the projected needs for 1969-70, 593 more positions will be required, 335 for eligibility determina- tion, and 258 for services.

To achieve this objective, grants are provided to communities to finance demonstration projects in homemaker services, day care services, and counseling and referral services for the aging; grants are given to counties to finance demonstration projects in homemaker services, day care services, activity centers, multi-purpose centers, counseling personnel, foster care for the aging, sheltered workshops and volunteer services; and grants are made to political subdivisions for demonstration projects offering protective serv- ices for the aging including casework, psychiatric, legal and related services. There has been a steady growth and interest in provision of services such as homemaker, foster care, clubs, centers and housing in local communities for the aging population. As of 1960, Pennsylvania had a population of 1,128,523 persons 65 years of age and over. By 1970, we anticipate an aging population of approximately 11/2 million. The percentage of older persons in Pennsylvania increased from 8.4 percent in 1950 to 10.4 percent in 1968. In addition, the number of very old people will increase substantially. Between 1950 and 1960, there was an increase of 50 percent of persons 85 years and pver. Various surveys conducted in connection with the White House Con- ference on Aging activities and recent local surveys and Federal data, has indicated that this population had serious problems in meetings its health, social services, recreational, housing and income needs. The movement to earlier retirement in industries and public services and the availability of social security benefits at 62 years is thrusting larger and larger numbers of older individuals with increased leisure time and social service needs upon the resources of the local communities. The experience with the program has been comparatively brief and has been operative only in a limited number of counties, but there is sufficient data, case histories, and warm letters of commendation to demonstrate that the program is effective and is accomplishing the purpose and objectives for which it was established. It will require several more years to demonstrate the full effect that these non-institutional programs will have on reducing the need for additional institutional beds, and to increase the participation by a number of counties, that have little or no social welfare services for their older citizens. The 1969-70 budget will continue the program at the present level. SUBSIDIES FOR THE BLIND (Dollar Amounts In Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Increase Expend.

This overall objective is pursued through: vocational rehabilitation of persons who are visually handicapped which will enable them to become engaged in a gainful occupation; remedial eye care to arrest, remove or prevent visual impairment; grants to vocational rehabilitation agencies for physical expansion of facilities, enlarged staff, and expanded programs to en- able agencies to serve more persons. The vocational rehabilitation activity provides rehabilitation services to approximately 2,500 persons resulting in rehabilitation of about 900 per- sons per year. However, there are 2,000 additional applicants who are po- 210 Public Welfare tentially eligible for vocational rehabilitation. No decrease in the number of persons awaiting service is expected because the incidence of visual loss And the number of persons in need of rehabilitation continues to increase. The remedial eye care activity serves approximately 15,000 persons per year. The mobile eye clinic and the prevention of blindness activity operated in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Association for the Blind serves approximately 10,000 persons per year and through utilization of trained volunteers, provides pre-school children with vision screening. The funds available for grants to vocational rehabilitation agencies has not met the demand for expansion as indicated by applications from facilities which are considered approvable in consideration of need. The vocational rehabilitation activity budget will provide for more than a 20 per cent increase in the number of persons rehabilitated and at the same time establish a means of providing services to the visually handi- capped in culturally deprived areas. A decrease in the number of persons awaiting service will also result with the prospect of improving the per- centage of persons rehabilitated in comparison to the number of applicants. The remedial eye care activity and the prevention of blindness activity will be expanded to cover services for persons now not reached. Early pro- vision of services will prevent loss of vision and allow those who are impaired to return to their homes as participating community members. The grants to rehabilitation agencies will be expanded to include ad- ditional services for persons who are visually limited and will enable them to enter a gainful occupation. The additional Federal funds anticipated for the 1969-70 fiscal year will provide for increased activities even though there is a slight decrease in state funds recommended.

This program includes day care services, foster family care, service to un- married parents and their children, adoption service, protective services, in- stitutional, and other group care. These services are provided or purchased by County Child Welfare Agencies, with payment by the State up to a max- imum of 50 percent of total expenditures. During 1968-69, it is estimated that a total of 70,100 children will receive services under the program. An estimated 36,000 will be handled in their own homes, 25,000 will receive foster family care, 7,900 will receive insti- tutional care, 850 will receive adoptive home service and 350 will receive a variety of services. The State presently pays the counties for approximately 35% of the total expenditures for this program. The 1969-70 budget will enable the counties to assist an estimated 75,000 children. About 39,500 children will receive services in their own homes, 26,500 will receive foster family care, 7,700 will receive institu- tional care, 900 will receive adoptive home services, and about 400 will re- ceive other services. The present rate of 35% sharing will be continued dur- ing 1969-70.

This objective is achieved through a program of guided group living, social work, psychology, psychiatry, education, religion and recreation. The Commonwealth and its counties are each obligated to pay one-half of the operating costs of the school. The number served by this institution was relatively stable until mid- 1967 when commitments declined due to the effects of the U. S. Supreme Court \"Gault\" Decision which required due process in Juvenile Courts.

GRANTS TO COMMUNITIES FOR JUVENILE DELINQUENCY PROGRAMS (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 1 Estimated Expend. $ 1,350 Increase Decrease $ \u2014600 State Funds Budget $ 750 1 212 Public Welfare The objective is to promote and maintain effective police handling of children to assure that they will receive knowledgeable police service protection, and to redirect juvenile gang activities toward socially acceptable conduct. To fulfill this objective, the State provides financial aid to local gov- ernments to be used for hiring additional police staff, increased salaries for the present staff, specialized training in the handling of children, and the develop- ment of guidelines and procedures for the most effective police service within current social and legal concepts. Another goal is the development of de- linquency prevention activities, such as gang control work in major cities. Of the 83 local governments of sufficient size to warrant the need for specially trained full-time law enforcement officers, 72 have developed police- juvenile units, every member of which has been provided Departmentally- required training. Correspondingly, during the last three years, the number 'of full-time officers has increased from 349 in 1966 to 420 in 1968.. With the expansion in the number of juvenile police officers in the past three years, the average number of children per juvenile officer has decreased from 4,366 in 1966 to 3,847 in 1968. The training program for law enforcement officers has provided 113 institutes for 5,273 students, totaling 126,348 training hours since 1961. It has covered 912 police departments from 52 counties. Major gang work activities are now in effect in Philadelphia and Pitts- burgh. With a measurable and marked increase in social unrest, particularly among young people in metropolitan areas, a marked increase in demand for trained, disciplined personnel of social awareness and knowledge is a prime national priority in the law enforcement area. Social demands for equity and justice have increased measurably and can be expected to continue to re- quire both skill and understanding on the part of authoritative services. The 1969-70 budget will continue Police Services and Crime Prevention at the current levels ($600,000 and $150,000, respectively). The recommended decrease of $600,000 is due to the transfer of subsidies for Juvenile Probation to the Juvenile Court Judges Commission in the Department of Justice. It is assumed that the problem of juvenile delinquency will continue in the future until the environmental, cultural and social conditions which pro- duces the majority of delinquents has been corrected.

In order to accomplish this it will be necessary to increase the kind and amount of services available, and to provide more adequate payments to providers of services. Persons eligible for medical care are all those receiving cash payments and those who would be eligible by reason of income but because of the lien or relative responsibility requirements or some other reason do not choose to receive a cash payment. In addition, there are the medically needy who have income and assets in excess of the limits to qualify for a cash grant but who are considered medically needy and whose medical care is also provided through Departmental payments to vendors of services. The program now provides all eligible persons under age 65 with phy- sicians' services wherever rendered, inpatient hospital care, post-hospital care, clinic services, nursing care in the home, post-hospital private nursing home care, and nursing care in public institutions. Similar services are pro- vided for persons over age 65 for whom such care is not already furnished under Medicare. The program also provides for all persons except the medically needy; dental treatment, ambulance service, and prescribed drugs and prosthetic devices. Needy school children are provided with necessary medical, dental, and surgical treatment. In order to meet the goal of providing comprehensive medical care by 1975; dental, ambulance and pharmaceutical services must be made available for medically needy persons. With the initiation of these services, the medi- cally needy will be able to receive medical care in the same amount, dura- tion, and scope as other eligible persons. According to the best estimates available, approximately one million persons will receive a medical service under this program during 1969-70. The 1969-70 budget will provide for the same level of service as during 1968-69. A small increase is included to cover the higher costs of medical service.

Presently, the following three institutions are subsidized through this program: (a) Children's Heart Hospital, Philadelphia (b) Home for Crippled Children, Pittsburgh (c) Lancaster Heart Association These three facilities furnish 35,618 free patient days of care per year. The subsidy program has a maximum rate of reimbursement of $12 per day for these free days. The funds requested in 1969-70 for this program represent a decrease over 1968-69 since funds are not being requested for Philadelphia Psychiatric Hospital. This institution is now eligibile to participate in the Community Services for Mental Health/Mental Retardation Program.

COMMUNITY SERVICES FOR THE MENTALLY ILL AND MENTALLY RETARDED (Dollar Amounts In Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Expend. Increase Decrease Budget State Specific objectives of this program are: 215 Public Welfare 1. By July 1, 1969, to establish 41 county administrative units to formu- late plans and programs for the delivery of care, treatment and re- habilitation services for the mentally disabled. 2. To enable these county administrative units to make available the services mandated in the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1966, by providing the necessary funding on a formula basis. 3. Through the county units make available the following services: a. Short-term inpatient hospital care. b. Part-time hospitalization, day-time or overnight. c. Outpatient care. d. Rehabilitation services, including vocational evaluation, work ad- justment training, job placement, indefinite employment in sheltered workshops, activities centers, and group living arrangements. e. Training services in day care centers and activities centers. f. Consultation and education to individual practitioners and profes- sional groups in the community. g. Interim care for those accepted for admission to a state school and hospital but for whom there is not available space. h. Appropriate services to meet emergency situations and the needs of those released from inpatient facilities. This program currently provides for the following services through direct grants or the purchase of care: Interim Care for the Mentally Retarded\u2014Purchases residential care through county governments from 43 licensed facilities for 1,600 mentally retarded persons who are currently on the waiting list for admittance to state schools. Planning Grants\u2014County Administration\u2014Provides grants to county units for the development of plans and programs for the provision of mental health/mental retardation services within their geographical area. Grants to Community Mental Health/Mental Retardation Clinics\u2014Provides grants to local mental health/mental retardation clinics to assist in and promote the development of these clinics to assure the availability of ade- quate care and treatment services within the local community. Sheltered Workshops for the Mentally Retarded\u2014Subsidizes some 32 local workshops who provide vocational and rehabilitative programs for some 1,700 Mentally Retarded persons. Day Care for Mentally Retarded\u2014Purchase day care services for the mentally retarded through local child welfare agencies to enable parents to be free to work or to have a respite from the rigors of constant care of the patient. Current plans to reach the objectives include the continuation and ex- pansion of the current programs except the Grants to Community Mental Health,/Mental Retardation Clinics and the Planning Grants. Instead of providing direct grants to clinics the State will purchase these services through the county administrative units. As county plans come into being, the Planning Grants will cease and the State will then pay 90 per cent of the county administration costs. Patients who can afford to do so are required to pay for the service they receive. Also, the Medical Assistance Program pays for these services for the medically indigent. In order to fulfill the mandate for services as set forth in the Mental Health Act of 1966 the counties have been encouraged to develop compre- hensive services. The increase in funds for this program are necessary to pay the costs of these rapidly expanding community services for the mentally ill and the mentally retarded. 1 1 1 216 Public Welfare III ELWYN INSTITUTE (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 e State Funds only Estimated Expend. $2,252 Increase Decrease $ 229 Budget $2,481 The primary objective of this program is to make available through State aid as many residential beds for the mentally retarded as is possible within available resources to supplement the State schools and hospitals. In achieving the objective of the Mental Retardation Program of pro- viding residential care to all mentally retarded persons who can achieve the greatest benefit from such care, this institution provides care, treatment, and training to supplement that given at the State schools and hospitals. Elwyn Institute is a private school and hospital which conducts an active education and training program to rehabilitate mentally retarded students for return to the community as self-supporting and useful citizens. The State subsidizes this facility for the care of wards who are otherwise eligible for admittance to a State school but for whom there are no beds available. The current program provides for the care of up to 577 State wards at an annual per capita cost of $3,900. The recommended increase in funds will provide for $4,300 per capita costs of maintaining State wards at Elwyn Institute. WESTERN PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE AND CLINIC (Dollar Amounts In Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 State Funds only Estimated Expend. $2,500 Increase Decrease Budget $2,500 II The objectives of this Institute are to alleviate the effects of mental ill- ness through study and research into the causes, treatment, prevention, and cure of the various types of nervous disorders and mental diseases and to increase the number of qualified psychiatrists needed as a result of the mounting number of persons requiring attention for mental disorders. Special training in mental illness for undergraduate and graduate students preparing to enter the practice of general medicine is provided. In meeting these objectives, the Institute conducts residency training programs in general psychiatry, child psychiatry, social and community psychiatry and forensic psychiatry; clinical workstudy programs on the graduate level in social work, psychology, special education, anthropology, child development and child care; an affiliate nursing education program for hospital schools of nursing; a continuing education program for physicians; and an allied personnel clinical work-study program for medical secretaries, medical record technicians, social work technicians, child care and child de- velopment workers and occupational therapy aides. To support this training and research the following clinical services are provided through a 186 bed hospital, psychoanalytic service, psychiatric outpatient clinic, psychiatric consultation services, psychosomatic outpatient service, children's service and the Arsenal Family and Children's Service Center.

The Bureau discharges its duties by placing revenue agents, resource investigators and a small clerical staff at each state-owned mental and medi- cal-surgical institution. It also designates the business managers of State Colleges and Correctional Institutions as Associate Revenue Agents for purposes of receiving and transmitting Commonwealth monies. The current census of patients and/or inmates admitted to State Schools, Mental and General Hospitals is estimated at 197,000. This figure is increas- ing at an annual rate of 7.5 per cent and this trend is expected to continue. The amount recommended will provide for ten additional clerical per- sonnel to process forms and documents required for Medicare payments to the State. County Collections (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 171 339 510 The program has four primary responsibilities. It prepares and distributes various licenses to issuing agents throughout the State and collects and transmits the license fees to the appropriate funds. The Bureau administers and enforces the laws regarding inheritance and estates taxes. It administers and enforces through the county recorders of deeds, the Realty Transfer Tax, and conducts investigations and tax base analyses involving review of affidavits of value. The fourth major responsibility of the Bureau is to process escheat cases and decedent estates in which the Commonwealth has an interest. The operation of this program involves an estimated processing for the current fiscal year of 46,000 Inheritance Tax cases, 261,000 real estate transfers and 825,000 dog licenses, plus the collection of an estimated $1,800,000 from escheatable property. The major increase is caused by the prospective transfer into this pro- gram's complement of 336 persons who are now being paid out of the non- budgeted inheritance tax collections. These employes currently hold jobs in local county inheritance tax offices. They appraise property in decedents estates and perform general enforcement and clerical activities. 221 10 379 1 Revenue Department The transfer of these positions will have no budgetary effect on the General Fund since the increased expenditures will be offset by increased Inheritance Tax deposits. This transfer is desirable to provide closer super- vision and control over the operation of this function.

Complement _ 193 193 This program administers and enforces the laws and regulations pur- suant to the collection of tax revenue covered by the Cigarette Tax Act, Un- fair Cigarette Sales Act, Malt Beverage Tax Act and the Spiritous and Vinous Tax Act. The program currently processes, on an annual basis 125,000 applications for cigarette licenses; reports from 325 cigarette stamp affixing agencies and 700 wholesale dealers; 32,400 reports from 4,800 magistrates; and 29,500 re- ports relating to malt beverage and spiritous and vinous collections. It is believed that this operation will not change substantially in the next five years. The objectives of this program are being met by evaluating applications and issuing licenses to sell cigarettes, the audit and recording of reports from all agents covered by the Malt Beverage and the Spiritous and Vinous Acts, and the receipt, verification, and deposit of monies due the Commonwealth from magistrate fines. The amount recommended will provide more adequate investigative tech- niques and equipment for the enforcement of the Cigarette Tax Act.

State Funds $8,017 Complement Increase Decrease $ 921 Budget $8,938 \u201411 1,071 This program administers and enforces the collection of the Selective Sales and Use Tax and the Hotel Occupancy Tax. Duties are to make field audits and investigations, issue licenses, process returns, and provide a tax education program for the public. In addition the program administers the provisions under the law for refunding overpayment of taxes for education paid to the Commonwealth. For the fiscal year 1967-68, this program conducted 83,729 investigations and 3,554 audits that are increasing annually at the rate of 1 per cent and .5 per cent respectively. It is anticipated that this rate will increase over the next five years. Motor Vehicle Sales and Use Tax returns are currently estimated at 2,250,000 annually and are increasing at about 4 per cent a year. The objectives of the program are being met by the issuance of licenses to all subject taxpayers, the audit of returns for accuracy and timeliness, and the creation of billings for delinquent taxes. The Field Operations Division conducts enforcement investigations and audits taxpayers records to deter- mine that all businesses subject to the taxes are properly licensed and that all licensees are properly collecting and transmitting tax revenues. The major activity to be expanded is the field audit division. An in- crease in the audit complement is included to reduce the number of quar- terly reports assigned to each auditor. In the calendar year 1967, the records indicate that the average productivity per auditor was $36,790 with an 1 222 Refunding Education Tax State Funds (Dollar Amounts In Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Increase Expend.

The 1969-70 budgeted amount which has been distributed totals $34,681,560. The $1,500,000 amount remaining is being appropriated to the Department of State since it cannot be directly assessed to the General Fund agencies. Department of State The Department of State compiles, publishes and certifies all election returns; issues all commissions to elected and appointed officials; records and punctuates all laws passed by the General Assembly; administers corporate and selected non-corporate business laws; supervises the State, State Police and Municipal retirement systems; administers the professional and occupa- tional licensing boards; regulates solicitation activities, boxing and wrestling matches and licenses auctioneers. The Department of State is administered by the Secretary of the Com- monwealth and includes the State Athletic Commission, State Employes Re- tirement Board, Municipal Employes Retirement Board and the 18 pro- fessional and occupational licensing boards. The expenses of the Department are financed through General Fund appropriations and augmentations in the form of license fees and assessments on municipal employes retirement members.

The Police receive a General Fund appropriation for criminal law en- forcement and a Motor License Fund transfer for traffic patrol activities. The hours worked by the troopers in the field are tabulated weekly and from the year-end totals a ratio of work activity is compiled and becomes the basis for the following year's appropriations. In 1969-70 the ratio will be 23 per cent General Fund and 77 per cent Motor License Fund. In addition the State Police receive augmentations from the Turnpike Commission for turnpike patrol, from the sale of patrol cars replaced by new vehicles, and an amount from the Motor License Fund for the operation and maintenance of traffic safety facilities.

The program maintains a private detective registry and library, administers and manages the crime laboratories and operates the data processing center. The number of fingerprints submitted in 1967 (116,193) reflected an increase of 6,4 per cent over 1966 (109,495). The first 6 months of 1968 (61,652) reflected a further increase of 13.8 per cent. Paralleling the normal increase, a concentrated effort is being made to fully implement the concept of the fingerprint law which authorizes the taking and furnishing of finger- prints to the State Police by local police agencies and correctional insti- tutions. A recent study conducted by the Department shows that of 1,150 local police departments in the State, only 333 are submitting fingerprint cards to the Department. With the possible influx of 817 additional police depart- ments submitting fingerprints in this budget period, an increase in work- load of 64,000 prints is estimated. The Firearms Section maintains a central statewide record of gun in- formation submitted by dealers, sheriffs, chiefs of police, county treasurers, state and local police departments. Crime laboratory services will have to be substantially expanded to meet increasing needs in the future. There is greater awareness of the merits of scientific investigation as well as an increased need due to the restrictions placed on other phases of criminal investigation. With the expansion in population and the even greater rate of increase in the crime rate, the de- mand for crime laboratory services will be increased accordingly. The amount budgeted will provide for additional technical personnel in the crime laboratories and in the Fingerprint and Firearms Sections. 11 111 Hg fiB ID ID ID Fire Protection (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 II Augmentations Total Complement ..

This responsibility involves all of the administrative aspects of successful network operation, including specialized training of personnel, preparation of opera- tion manuals and instructions, communication equipment specification writ- ing, equipment evaluation, and systems improvement. This Division is also in charge of the technical aspects of the State Police radar program. The participation in the National Crime Information computer system is a new concept for all law enforcement agencies. The State Police operate a headquarters and a general alarm (13 state) communication network with retransmission processes to a national crime index system. It entails a 24-hour work day and six pieces of communica- tions equipment with three computer applications; i.e., operator's records in Dept. of Revenue, State Police teletypewriter network for stolen car disc storage, and the FBI National Crime Information System. A consulting firm is presently conducting a statewide State Police and related law enforcement communications and total information system study. The effect of this will be an increased work load because of greater com- munication capabilities. An amount of $2,920,000 ($671,000 General Fund and $2,249,000 Motor License Fund) has been budgeted for the lease of a new radio communica- tions system to be installed during 1969-70. An estimated $50,000 in Federal monies will be received for this communications system. Due to the technital sophistication of the new system and since it is expected to be utilized for complete statewide radio coverage, an additional 51 technical personnel have been budgeted to staff the key positions in the system.

Recently enacted National Highway Safety Standards will force a rmajor expansion of this program in the 1969-70 fiscal year. Licenses will be restricted to type of vehicles and most licensees will have to be tested every four years for visual acuity and knowledge of rules of the road. The anticipated effect will be: The amount of tests will increase from approximately 250,000 persons to over 1.5 million persons per year. The amount of time to take a test will be increased as the present test is expanded. An approximate 6.67 per cent of the persons re-examined would be required to take a driving test. This would be determined by a person's physical condition or driving record. It would take 1.5 examinations to pass this test and this would increase the number of driving examinations that would have to be given. An increase of thirty driver license examiners is budgeted for 1969-70, at a cost of $95,000 from the Motor License Fund, to handle these expansions. 1 1 1 236 ill th lID III' State Police Source of Funds Federal Funds: (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Expend.

All employes would receive at least a 10 per cent increase on that date. A general salary increase is essential in order for the Commonwealth to remain competitive with business and industry, the Federal Government, and other public employers, as well as to keep pace with the steeply rising cost of living. In the two-year period since January 1, 1967, when the last general pay increase for State employes was granted, the national consumer price index has risen by about 8 per cent. If current trends continue, the cost of living will have increased approximately 10 per cent by July 1, 1969. In addition, Federal employes have received across-the-board pay raises amounting to 9.5 per cent since January 1, 1967, and the employes of five other industrial states have been granted general salary increases ranging from 10 per cent to 15 per cent during the same period. These states are Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, and Ohio. (Dollar Amounts In Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Increase Expend.

Our summary of General Fund revenue estimates for the 1968-69 and 1969-70 fiscal years follows. It presents estimates by major category and specific type of tax within each category. Charts and graphs, following the summary, depict historical data for each specific type of General Fund revenue. Amounts reported for fiscal 1959-60 through the 1967-68 fiscal year are actual collections for each fiscal year. No attempt was made to adjust collections for the thirteen month fiscal period which occurred in 1961-62, nor for changes to the tax rate or base which may have occurred over the years. Accompanying narratives describe the source of revenue and the basis for the estimated receipts for each type of tax. The General Fund is the major operating fund of the Commonwealth. It receives all tax receipts and other types of revenue not specified by law to be placed in special funds. Except for certain restricted receipts, the in- come of the General Fund is appropriated in specific amounts for the ordinary programs of government.

The rate is levied on the taxable income as returned to and ascertained by the Fed- eral government. When the entire business of any corporation is not trans- actd within this Commonwealth, the taxable income in Pennsylvania is de- termined by an allocation formula. The rate was increased from six to seven per cent for taxable years 1967 and 1968 and from seven to seven and one-half per cent for taxable years 1969 and thereafter. This tax was first enacted in 1935 as an emergency tax. It was con- tinued every two years at various rates and now is permanent. A 1951 act required a 50 per cent prepayment of the current and subsequent years corporate net income tax. An additional 30 per cent prepayment was enacted in 1961 increasing the prepayment requirement to 80 per cent. Both cal- endar year and fiscal reporting corporations are required to annually trans- mit tentative reports together with 80 per cent prepayments of the current year tax based on the last reported annual net income received or on income received or accrued during the first three months of the current year. These tentative reports and tax payments are due four months after the beginning of the current year. The remaining portion of the tax due is to be reported and paid within 105 days after the close of the calendar or fiscal year or within 30 days after the filing of Federal returns. For the 1968-69 fiscal year an estimated $308.5 million will be collected in Corporate Net Income Taxes. Our 1969-70 estimate predicts collections of aproximately $327.7 million from this tax source. These predictions are based on the assumption that national corporate profits will rise to $91 billion in 1968 which is an increase of 11.5 per cent over the $81.6 billion level for calendar 1967 and national corporate profits for 1969 will approxi- mate $97 billion, an increase of 6.6 per cent over 1968. For calendar 1970 we predict National Corporate Profits will reach the level of $105 billion which is approximately an 8 per cent increase over 1969. Direct comparison between the revised estimate data for fiscal 1968-69 and 1969-70 estimate with actual collections experience during fiscal 1967- 68, may be somewhat misleading in terms of the rate of growth. The fiscal 1967-68 collections reflect receipts from newly enacted tax increases, which will continue to have varying degrees of importance upon our revenue estimates through the 1969-70 fiscal year. 1 262 General Fund Revenue Sources 100 80 CAPITAL STOCK AND Millions 4104114n FRANCHISE TAX General Fund Capital Stock and Franchise Tax Actual 1959-60 1959 1960 1951 1962 1 63 1964 1965 1996 1967 1968 1 69 60 GI 62 03 64 65 66 97 8 69 0 FISCAL YEAR 1968-69 $76,300,000 1969-70 76,500,000 The Capital Stock and Franchise Taxes are levied at the rate of six mills on the actual value of capital stock (excepting capital used directly in manufacturing and processing) allocable to Pennsylvania corporations, joint-stock associations and limited partnerships. For foreign corporations, the proportional value of the firms capital stock, subject to tax, is deter- mined by its activity in Pennsylvania in relation to its activity everywhere by using a three-fraction formula. Effective January 1, 1968, domestic cor- porations are allowed the option to compute their tax by using the three- fraction Franchise Tax formula. An 80 percent prepayment requirement for both taxes was enacted in 1956. Both calendar year and fiscal year operating firms are required to annually transmit tentative reports together with 80 percent prepayments of the current year tax based upon either the amount of estimated taxes reported for the preceding taxable year or upon the amount of taxes last settled or resettled against the corporation for a preceding taxable year, whichever is greater. These tentative reports and tax payments are due four months after the beginning of the current taxable year. The remaining tax payment must be paid within 105 days following the close of the tax- able year. The rate for both taxes was increased from five to six mills effective January 1, 1967. Distilling companies are currently taxed at a ten-mill rate on the value of their capital stock employed within the State, but beginning in 1970 this rate will drop to six mills. Our estimate for the Capital Stock and Franchise Tax for fiscal 1968- 69 is $76.3 million and for the 1969-70 fiscal year our estimate is $76.5 million. Both of these figures reflect the upward influence in the tax rate but, in addition, they reflect a downward influence resulting from the so- called \"Rockwell Amendment.\" This amendment allows domestic corpo- rations the same tax computation options as those allowed to foreign cor- porations. Underlying these estimates is a growth rate of 4 per cent which reflects our experience over a period of time and is compatible with the 4 to 5 per- cent growth in capital expenditures which is projected for 1969. fil 11 11 II II 11 263 General Fund Revenue Sources UTILITIES GROSS RECEIPTS TAX Millions of Dollars 50 40 20 la 1959 1960 1961 1962 19 3 1964 1965 1966 1967 1 68 1 FISCAL YEAR General Fund Utilities Gross Receipts Tax The Utilities Gross Receipts Tax is levied on the gross receipts from business transacted within Pennsylvania by specified utilities owned, oper- ated or leased by corporations, associations or individuals. The tax rate is twenty mills for all utilities except motor transportation companies, which are taxed at the rate of eight mills. The tax rate on non-motor transpor- tation companies was increased from fourteen to twenty mills, effective July 1, 1967. A 1967 Act provided for an exemption for gross receipts of sales of gas by municipally owned or operated utilities from business done inside the limits of the municipality, effective July 1, 1968. An 80 per cent prepayment requirement for this tax was enacted in 1961. All companies, except municipally owned or operated public utilities and motor transportation companies, are required to annually transmit tenta- tive reports together with 80 percent payment of the current year tax based on the taxable gross receipts for the first three months of the current cal- endar year. The reports and prepayments must be submitted by April 30 of each year, while the remaining amount due must be paid by April 15 of the following year. The sharp increases in revenue collections depicted in the graph are the results of the enactment of the tax prepayment requirement in 1961 and the rate increase in 1967. Our estimate of the Utilities Gross Receipts Tax for fiscal 1968-69 is $46.0 million, while the estimate for fiscal 1969-70 is $47.4 million. After allowing for the revenue effects of statutory changes, the rate of growth projected for the 1969-70 fiscal year is approximately 3.5 per cent. This is in line with historical experience which has shown a similar average rate of growth between 1953 and 1968 on an adjusted basis.

On foreign companies, the tax is based on the amount of business transacted in Pennsylvania. Receipts from the tax on foreign fire insurance and foreign casualty companies are not deposited in the General Fund but are distributed for the benefit of local volunteer fire companies and local police retirement systems. The portion of the tax in excess of two per- cent due from retaliatory provisions with other states plus an amount for administration of the tax is, however, deposited in the General Fund as general revenue. Marine insurance companies, both domestic and foreign, pay a five per cent tax on underwriting profits attributable to Pennsylvania in lieu of the gross premiums tax. An 80 per cent prepayment requirement for life and limited life in- surance companies, both foreign and domestic, was enacted in 1961. Ten- tative tax reports with the 80 per cent prepayment of the tax based on the taxable gross premiums reported for the entire preceding calendar year or on the taxable gross premiums for the first three months of the current calendar year are due April 30 of the current calendar year. The remain- ing amount due is reportable and payable by April 15 of the next year. Enactment of the prepayment requirement is reflected by the sharp rise in tax collections for the 1960-61 fiscal year. Receipts from the Insurance Premium Tax are expected to amount to $31.5 million in fiscal 1968-69 and $33.1 million in fiscal 1969-70. The 1969- 70 estimate reflects a rate of growth of approximately 5.1 per cent over the previous fiscal year. Since 1956 the average annual rate of growth on an adjusted basis, has been about 4.4 per cent, while for the past five years it has averaged about 5.2 per cent. Our trend projections as related to eco- nomic growth are compatible with our historical experience. 265 General Fund Revenue Sources FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TAX II II Millions at 04114rs ID 1959 1960 -u -m 1961 19 2 1963 1964 1965 1966 990 1960 1 69 -u -0 -m \u20140 \u20140 \u201461 \u20140 \u20140 30 20 10 0 The Bank Shares Tax is levied at the rate of ten mills on the actual value of shares of State and National banks, title insurance and trust com- panies located within the Commonwealth. Actual value, as used in computing this tax, is ascertained' by adding the amount of capital stock paid in and the amount of surplus and undi- vided profits, and dividing the result by the number of shares. Each in- stitution functions on a self-assessing basis and may pay the tax from gen- eral funds or collect the amount from its shareholders. The date of ascer- tainment of the value of shares of capital stock is January 1. The rate was increased from eight to ten mills effective for the cal- endar year 1967. An excise tax of seven and one-hall per cent is levied on net earnings or income of mutual thrift institutions. This tax rate was increased from six per cent effective for the calendar year 1967. Taxes on bank shares and mutual thrift institutions are subject to an 80 per cent prepayment requirement enacted in 1961 and 1964 respectively. Tentative reports are, due and tax prepayment payable by April 15 of the current calendar year, with the remaining amount due payable by April 15 of the next year. Enactment of the tax prepayment requirements and the rate increase of 1967 are reflected by the sharp rise in revenue collections depicted in the charts above. Because of the many changes in the tax bases for the various financial institutions, estimation for this source of revenue does not lend itself to trend analysis. For fiscal 1968-69 we estimate that $25.1 million will be received from Financial Institutions Taxes. Our estimate for fiscal 1969-70 is also $25.1 million. In relatively recent years, the tax on Mutual Thrift Institutions was shifted from a tax on stock to a tax on income. Our experience, though brief, suggests that relatively little growth in revenues will be experienced from one year to another. After making adjustments needed to make es- timates for successive years comparable, we arrived at an anticipated growth rate of approximately 1.3 per cent between the 1968-69 and 1969-70 fiscal years. 11 11 266 ID General Fund Revenue Sources OTHER SELECTIVE BUSINESS TAXES II Millions ol Dollars 12 5 PEN11.\u00b01\u00b0....

Other tax sources for this category are listed under Legal References. Of the taxes in this category, one of the most productive sources of revenue is the Corporate Income Tax. It is levied on corporations which own property or carry on business activities in Pennsylvania and are not subject to the Corporate Net Income Tax. The tax rate was increased from six to seven per cent for the taxable years 1967 and 1968 and from seven to seven and one-half per cent for 1969. The tax is based on net income allocable to Pennsylvania and, like other business taxes, requires an 80 per cent pre- payment. Our fiscal 1968-69 estimate for Other Selected Business Taxes is $9.9 million. The estimate for the 1969-70 fiscal year is $10.5 million, which anticipates a 6.6 per cent growth rate.

Take-home food and ordinary clothing are ex- empted. The present tax rate of six per cent based on a bracket system became effective January 1, 1968, and at the same time, the fifty-cent restau- rant meal exemption was eliminated. The tax rate is scheduled to return to five per cent on July 1, 1969, but our estimates are based upon maintenance at the present level. Vendors who collect $600 or more in a calendar quarter are required to remit collections monthly within 45 days of the last day of the collection month, with the exception of May collections which are due 20 days after the end of May. Those collecting more than $75 annually but less than $600 in a calendar quarter report quarterly and transmit collections within 30 days of the end of the collection quarter, except that April and May collections are due within 20 days after the end of May. The remainder is due within 30 days of the end of the collection quarter. Vendors collecting less than $75 annually are required to remit on a semi-annual basis by February 20 and August 20. Sales tax on motor vehicles is collected directly by the Department of Revenue when application for a certificate of title is made. In fiscal year 1968-69 we estimate that revenue from the Education Sales and Use Tax will amount to $899.7 million while for fiscal year 1969-70 our estimate of receipts from this tax source is $945.6 million. The rate of growth underlying the 1969-70 estimate is approximately 5.1 per cent. This growth rate is influenced by the rate of growth in both personal income and personal consumption expenditures. Between 1968 and 1969 personal income is expected to rise about 5.7 per cent while personal consumption expendi- tures for the same period may show an increase of approximately 6 per cent. Some falloff can be expected in Sales Tax revenues as a result of the recent United States Supreme Court decision exempting National banks from state sales and use taxes.

It is levied on the ultimate consumer, but usually is collected by sale of stamps to dealers who affix these to each package. On October 16, 1967, the permanent tax rate was increased from seven to thirteen cents per package of 20 cigarettes. This is reflected by the sharp rise on the graph. At the same time, the one cent per package previously levied to finance the bonds issued for the Korean Veterans' bonus was deleted. Receipts from the Cigarette Tax should amount to approximately $172.9 million during fiscal 1968-69, after adjusting for last year's tax rate increase and reflecting current collection experience. Taking these factors into con- sideration, we estimate that fiscal 1969-70 receipts will total $178.5 million, an increase of approximately 3 per cent. This growth rate assumes a reassertion of the historical growth rate after the earlier period of adjustment to the new tax rates. In the two years just prior to the recent enactment of the increased Cigarette Tax, the annual rate of growth was approximately 3 per cent.

The tax rate is two-thirds cent per half pint, one-cent per pint and $2.48 per barrel. The tax is paid monthly by the various manufacturers directly to the Department of Revenue. The Malt Beverage Tax for fiscal 1967-68 amounted to $20.6 million which is less than the actual collections of approximately $21.6 million for fiscal 1966-67. For the most part, this drop in receipts was due to the fact that some taxes were paid through the use of credits accumulated when the tax col- lection process was changed from the crown to the reported sales method. The use of credits in part-payment for Malt Beverage Taxes due will con- tinue until November, 1969, after which time it is anticipated that all ac- cumulated credits will have been used up. After adjusting the data for the use of credits virtually no change in tax liability occurred between these periods. The estimated revenues from the Malt Beverage Tax during 1968-69 is $20.4 million. We estimate these revenues to increase 5.4 per cent to $21.5 million in the 1969-70 fiscal year. This rate of increase is due to the fact that for approximately seven months of the fiscal year no credits will be used to pay taxes due and thus the cash flow will be correspondingly in- creased.

We estimate the fiscal 1968-69 Liquor Tax receipts will amount to $58.3 million, while during the 1969-70 fiscal year these revenues will increase to $61.3 million. The annual average growth rate for this revenue source has been approximately 4.5 per cent during the past five years. This upward trend is expected to increase during the 1969-70 fiscal to 5.2 per cent over 1968-69 Liquor Tax receipts.

The tax is paid through the purchase of stamps which are affixed to the legal document presented for recording. The chart above showing past collections from this tax indicates its fluctuating nature, but also shows its general upward trend. Receipts from the Realty Transfer Tax are expected to produce $28.8 million in fiscal 1968-69, and $30.4 million in the 1969-70 fiscal year for an increase of approximately 5.6 per cent. During the past ten years the average annual rate of growth has been 3.7 per cent; however, the last five years show an average growth of 6.9 per cent annually. Therefore, our estimated growth for 1969-70 falls within the range of these two extremes.

The rate is six per cent of the value after a personal exemption if passing to direct or lineal heirs and fifteen per cent, without exemption, if passing to collateral heirs. A tax rate increase from two to six per cent became effective December 29, 1967, for estates and transfers of persons dying on or after that date. Charities and other listed organizations are exempt. Taxes are collected for the State by counties within one year after the death of a person whose property is being transferred. An Estate Tax is levied on estates situated in Pennsylvania and applies to residents and non-residents. The tax is the difference between the In- heritance Tax imposed by the State and the credit allowed under the Fed- eral Estate Tax. The nature of this tax is such that estimating future revenues is diffi- cult. Receipts are dependent not only upon the number and time of deaths and time of settlement but also upon economic conditions since the value of larger estates, which are comprised largely of investments, fluctuate with stock market conditions. During the 1968-69 fiscal year, our estimates indicate a total of $104.2 million in Inheritance Taxes. In addition, we anticipate an approximate 3.5 per cent growth rate between 1968 and 1969 which will provide approximately $107.6 million of revenues in fiscal 1969-70.

Repealed taxes are those which are no longer in effect but for which revenues may be received from outstanding liabilities. Receipts from Minor and Repealed Taxes vary little from year to year. In both fiscal 1968-69 and 1969-70 we anticipate receipts of approximately $600,000 from this source.

This amount is transferred to the General Fund from the State Stores Fund to be used for general appropriation purposes. Liquor Store Profits for the 1968-69 fiscal year are estimated at $63.3 million. The transfers for fiscal 1969-70 are expected to approximate $55.9 million. After adjusting for an additional non-recurring transfer of $9.0 million in fiscal 1968-69, the growth between the 1968-69 and 1969-70 fiscal years is approximately 3 per cent reflecting the rate of growth experienced in previous fiscal years. toi fit tit II Ii II 275 General Fund Revenue Sources INSTITUTIONAL REIMBURSEMENTS Millions at Dalian 40 General Fund Institutional Reimbursements Actual 43,974,066 $41,600,000 38,900,000 Institutional Reimbursements include all payments by patients or their families for care in State hospitals and institutions. Also included are pay- ments by the counties for persons committed to correctional institutions by the courts of those counties. The estimated decline in receipts of institutional reimbursements is the result of a change in accounting procedure under which receipts from general hospitals are to be treated as augmentations to the appropriation for such hospitals, beginning January 1, 1969. Institutional Reimbursements for the 1968-69 fiscal year are estimated at $41.6 million and $38.9 million for fiscal 1969-70. After adjusting the revenues for these augmentations, the net growth rate of Institutional Reimbursements between the 1968-69 and 1969-70 fiscal years will be approximately 7 per cent. 1 II 1 1 276 General Fund Revenue Sources LICENSES, FEES AND MISCELLANEOUS REVENUE Millions 01 Dollar, Min 40 Mann 11111116MTAMI MS=la C ,95191111111111111.1111 10 -60 Licenses and Fees includes collections by State departments which are not specifically required by law to be placed in special funds to support a specific purpose. Although amounts obtained from an individual class of license very often are sufficient only to cover regulatory costs, any addi- tional money is available for general purposes. Certain licenses and fees are required in a multitude of laws designed to protect the public from indiscrim- inate and unsafe practices. Those which bring the largest amounts of revenue into the General Fund are Dog Licenses, Public Utility Assessment Fees, In- surance Licenses and Fees, Vital Statistic Fees, Professional License Fees, and Cigarette License Fees. The Miscellaneous category includes all other income to be used for general appropriation purposes in the General Fund except monies which are given to the State by individual, or are provided by law to be used for a specific purpose only. Included in miscellaneous income are monies from such sources as escheats, sale of forest products, sale or rent of Common- wealth property, and interest on securities and deposits. Also included are transfers from other special funds. Revenue collections for the fiscal year 1967-68 included a non-recurring transfer from the Korean Conflict Veterans' Fund which contributed to the more than $10.0 million increase over the previous fiscal year. Collections from all these sources are estimated at $32.7 million for the 1968-69 fiscal year. During 1969-70, however, collections should total $35.0 million, representing an increase of 6.4 per cent over the previous fiscal year.

The largest portion is from corporation taxes, pen- alties and interest. Also included are fines and penalties other than those used to enforce tax regulations and those not required by law to be placed into a special fund for a specific purpose. Most of these fines and penalties collected by the various departments are an integral part of enforcement of the laws providing for licenses and fees. By far the largest segment of the amounts received are fines for violations of the Vehicle Code. Total collections for Fines, Penalties and Interest are estimated at $4.3 million for fiscal 1968-69 and $4.7 million in fiscal 1969-70. The rate of growth between the 1968-69 and 1969-70 fiscal years is projected at 9 per cent.

Administrative support is furnished by 24 Central Office Bureaus which coordinate the activities of 11 Engineering Districts and 66 county main- tenance organizations. Department program is evaluated by the State Highway Commission which makes recommendations for the program and its financing. The Commission is comprised of public officials and private citizens. The Sec- retary of Highways is an ex officio member and chairman of the Commis- sion. The respective chairmen of the Senate and House Highway Com- mittees, selected at the beginning of each Assembly, automatically become members of the Commission. The six other members are private citizens, otherwise holding no elective or public office, who are selected by the Gov- ernor with confirmation by two-thirds vote of the State Senate. By legis- lation, enacted in 1965, Philadelphia and Allegheny Counties are represented on the Commission. The administrative and operational activities of the Department are primarily financed by road-user taxes and fees paid into the State's Motor License Fund, and from federal-aid funds provided from road-user taxes and fees paid into the Federal Highway Trust Fund. Bond funds have also been used to finance projects in accordance with a long-range fiscal plan and the State Highway Commission's Six-Year Program. Some ad- ditional financing is received in the form of augmentations from the sale of Department owned vehicles. Program structure is reflected in this document as it now exists. Legis- lation has been proposed to create a Pennsylvania Department of Transporta- tion. In the event that this legislation is enacted there will be no appreciable changes in appropriations for this fiscal year except that appropriations made to all agencies involved will be transferred to the new Department. The construction program reflected in this budget is based on the revenues available from a proposed increase in license fees. These increased revenues to the Motor License Fund are projected to be $62.8 million for fiscal year 1969-70. General Administration (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 State Funds Estimated Expend. $15,729 1,409 Increase Decrease $ 2,315 Budget $18,044 Complement 33 1,442 Through this program the Secretary directs and coordinates the ac- tivities of the Department and supervises the day to day administration of affairs. Management activities are provided including; budgeting, plan- ning and programming, and control and maintenance of departmental expen- idtures. Also provided are the administrative personnel of the District offices including the District Engineer and other personnel who do not work 6 Motor License Fund Highways directly on engineering, right-of-way, construction, or maintenance projects. The program conducts a training program and an engineering intern program for employes; maintains a safety program to eliminate on-the-job accidents, and recommends the enactment of legislation pertinent to the functions and activities of the Department. The budgeted amount will continue these activities to support the con- struction program of the Department. Capital Outlay (Dollar Amounts In Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Expend. State Funds $ 13,599 Augmentation 200 $-1,343 _ . $--1,348 $ 12,451 Responsibilities of this program include: the acquisition of lands and construction and improvements of buildings to house Departmental per- sonnel and equipment; and the procurement of road and shop equipment, motor vehicles, office, engineering and laboratory equipment, and office furniture and fixtures. Equipment purchases for the Maintenance and Construction Programs must be in tune with replacement requirements as well as needs for the expanding work program, and must reflect an awareness of technological changes in processes and types of machinery available. The Department operates 20,000 units of equipment. Of the 2,200 units to be purchased in 1969-70, 78 per cent are replacements. It is anticipated that new equipment requirements in the future will grow due to replacement occasioned by normal wear, increasing need and rising equipment costs. Increases in the physical plant due to expanding space requirements . are evident in the budget for 1969-70. The five year building expansion plan is expected to require continued expenditures until 1972. Debt Service and Claims (Dollar Amounts In Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Expend. State Funds \u2014 $26,550 Increase Decrease $ 3,500 Budget $30,050 Bond debt service and other financial claims incurred by the Department are provided within this program. It makes the rental payments to the State Highway and Bridge Authority for highways and bridges constructed with borrowed funds used to expand the construction program beyond the level permitted by current revenues. Also provided are payments of claims to the public for damages done by Department personnel and equipment in the course of carrying out its activities. Additional yearly growth can be expected as the State Highway Com- mission's 6 year program progresses and increases in bond borrowings are required to meet project costs. As of September 1, 1968, $360 million in bonds had been issued. Future bond borrowings will be made as General Obligations of the Commonwealth and Debt Service requirements will be appropriated to the Treasury Department. State Highway and Bridge Authority rentals will continue for those projects currently under rental. 7.

Activities within this program in- clude preparing road inventories, traffic studies, highway classification, special studies, quality control of highway construction materials, and developing and testing of new materials. Transportation studies are underway in 11 cities where population ex- ceeds 50,000. Regional transportation planning organizations are at work in the two most populous areas of the state\u2014Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Con- sultant research and departmental force research has been expanded in the last year to provide answers that will improve bridge and road surfaces and extend the useful life of our roads while bringing to them an increased measure of safety. A total of 2,343 random samples were analyzed within the Department's materials laboratory during the 1967 calendar year. A total of 325 million gallons of bituminous material and 41/2 million barrels of cement were sampled and tested. Of the random samples tested in 1967, 16.0 per cent deviated from specification requirements. This is the highest per cent deviation for a single year in the history of the random sample program. The budget amount will cover efforts to reduce the percentage of deviations by increasing emphasis on the control of materials through improved inspection procedures, sampling techniques and inspection training. Engineering (Dollar Amounts In Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Increase Expend. Decrease Budget State 2,622 221 2,843 This program provides the design, redesign, and location of roadways, bridges, and structures, within the Commonwealth, to achieve a safe and ef- ficient Highway System. Activities of this program include the designing and contracting for design of highways and bridges, and testing and research services performed during the course of construction and maintenance. It also provides for payments to consultants for engineering and design services. Within this program future highway needs are studied in reference to safety, traffic volume, and location. The program is responsible for providing continued and improved controls to facilitate the safe and efficient flow of traffic on new and existing roadways. The Department's intent is to restructure the Engineering program to en- able it to provide more of the design and location work with Departmental personnel. This will increase the Engineering complement. However, this will provide a department force which in time will be highly trained and capable of performing a greater amount of complex engineering and design functions without the aid of costly Consultant Services. 8 II Motor License Fund Highways Right-of-Way (Dollar Amounts In Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Increase Expend. Decrease Budget State Funds $ $ 38,750 $114,071 Complement 675 66 741 This program provides for the acquisition of all necessary rights-of-way for construction, reconstruction, and relocation of highways and bridges deemed necessary to complement the Highway Construction program. Activities within this program include; informing the public of the Depart- ment's intentions, relocation services, property acquisition, payments to prop- erty owners, and all legal services needed for the acquisition of these prop- erties. At times property is acquired which contains capital equipment and machinery which is of no value to the construction project. The disposal of these items is a function of this program also. According to the Eminent Domain Code, property acquired is reimbursed on the basis of the difference between market value before and after acquisi- tion. The number of parcels of land acquired in the past three years are: 7,196 parcels in 1965-1966, 6,550 parcels in 1966-1967, 8,498 parcels in 1967-1968. The Commonwealth has relocation services available for all persons dis- placed by right-of-way acquisition. On federal aid projects where 25 or more families must be relocated, there is a Relocation Advisory Office maintained on the job site to give relocation assistance. These services include information on available housing, financing, and legal rights. Rising property costs, especially in the highly populated areas, are causing a continuous increase in right-of-way costs. Highway Construction (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Increase Expend. Decrease Budget State Funds This program provides for the construction, reconstruction, and improve- ment of roads and bridges on the state highway system, and inspection of these activities for adherence to established standards. The program covers all counties within the Commonwealth and includes Federal Interstate, Primary, Secondary, Urban, and Appalachia Roads, as well as roads in the 100 per cent state system. The subprograms of the Highway Constt uction Program are divided in this manner to classify the nature of the funding for each project. The following construction subprogram figures de- tail the above amounts and should not be included in the Department total.

Decrease State Funds $11,008 $ 657 Budget $11,665 Provides for all expenses relating to general construction activities not identifiable with specific construction projects. Although the number and miles of active contracts have been fairly stable the past thre years, the cost of the construction program has increased substantially. The number and amount of active construction contracts are estimated as follows: Date No. Miles (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) June 30, 1966 601 1412 $ 834,000 June 30, 1967 613 1411 978,000 June 30, 1968 626 1394 1,223,000 This is a result of the construction of more sophisticated and better roads, increased cost of construction, and an increase in labor costs necessary to perform these activities. Mileage contracts in lettings in the past three years have been as follows: Fiscal Year Miles 1965-66 695 1966-67 632 1967-68 586 Unpaid balances on the construction contracts on July 1, 1968, totaled $480 million.

Activities provided in this program include construction and reconstruc- tion of roads and bridges within the confines of institutional grounds, state parks, state forests, and military reservations. Construction and Maintenance of the emergency telephone system, and the maintenance of temporary detour routes which are not included as part of construction projects are also pro- vided under this program. This program provides gas and oil for motor vehicles to other Departments, Boards, and Commissions. It also constructs and maintains free bridges on the Delaware River in cooperative manage- ment with the states of New York and New Jersey. Funded within this program are Departmental activities and assistance to all Commonwealth Agencies, Municipalities, and non-profit organizations, to develop and implement projects under the provisions of the Federal High- way Safety Act. Highway Maintenance (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Increase Expend. Decrease Budget Complement .. 12,210 52 12,262 The program provides general routine maintenance of roads, bridges and structures on the 43,646 miles of the State Highway System to keep them in a safe and useable condition. Activities within this program include winter traffic services, pavement markings, cleaning and mowing, surface treatment, minor flood and storm damage repairs, painting traffic lines, erection and maintenance of traffic signs and the maintenance of roadside rests. Snow and ice service requires the use of 8,200 pieces of Department owned equipment and approximately 8,000 units of rented equipment. An average winter in Pennsylvania requires 560,000 tons of chemicals and 1I/2 million tons of anti-skid materials. The annual spring clean-up includes pavement sweeping and patching, washing road side signs, removing snow fence, and repainting yellow and white pavement markings. Snow plow damage to shoulders and signs are re- paired, eroded ditches are reshaped and grass is planted and fertilized. The usual collection of bottles and trash is disposed of. The annual maintenance program requires 90,000 pounds of grass seed, 927 tons of fertilizer, 18,715 gallons of weed spray, 23,630 pounds of soil sterilant, and 8,842 tons of calcium chloride. Road repair requires 175,000 tons of cold patch and 1,873,000 barrels of bituminous materials. Pavement markings re- quire 3 million pounds of glass beads and 1/2 million gallons of paint. The maintenance program also conducts a Motorists Assistance Program provided on 900 miles of expressways. More than 3,000 persons were aided by radio equipped units in 1967-68. Other departmental responsibilities in- clude inspection and maintenance of bridges and tunnels, and the upkeep of the 78 roadside rests and 1,200 picnic tables along the State Highway System. The amount budgeted for 1969-70 will continue maintenance activi- ties at approximately the same level.

Budget $17,253 9 1,096 12 Motor License Fund Highways This program provides the maintenance and operation of buildings and equipment necessary to carry out the Department's program in addition to manufacturing the traffic signs necessary for the safe and efficient control of traffic. Maintained are 20,000 units of equipment, including 900 automobiles, 370 survey corps busses, 270 pick-up trucks, 2,600 conventional and four-wheel drive trucks, 880 tractors, 975 rollers and 630 graders. In addition 500 engines are completely overhauled yearly in the Department's Equipment Division. Also maintained are 11 large district offices and 66 county offices, as well as testing laboratory buildings, the sign manufacturing facilities, the main head- quarters building in Harrisburg, and many smaller structures. Expansion of certain district and county offices is underway to provide the space necessary for the personnel and equipment needed to accomplish the six year program and to accommodate the upkeep requirements of the new facilities when completed. Traffic signals and pavement markings are involved in 80 per cent of the recommended improvements in high accident locations investigated by the Accident Review Teams. Based on these recommendations, the Department has established a policy of increased use of signs\u2014both replacement and new. A second production line was recently added in the Sign Shop to increase the output of signs required to meet demand. The number of units and usage of equipment is also increasing as addi- tional mileage is added to the system. The trend of service functions costs is upward. Procurement of Inventory (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 State Funds Estimated Expend. $5,813 Increase Decrease $ 934 Budget $6,747 This program provides the procurement of materials and supplies, neces- sary for other Highway Department programs to operate, which cannot be charged directly to the job or to a project or program at the time of purchase.

The subsidy is equal to 1.1 cents per gallon of gasoline sold within the Commonwealth. Payment of the funds to municipalities is closely regulated and controlled to determine that monies are expended for maintenance and construction of roads according to specifications. The distribution is made on a 60 per cent mileage and 40 per cent population formula. A 31/2 to 4 per cent annual growth can be expected in future years in accord with the past tax collection pattern and anticipated increase in fuel consumption. This rate of increment is not reflected in the past three years figures due to an amendment to the law which changed the payment schedule. All payments are now made annually in April, instead of twice a year, to the 2,561 boroughs, cities, townships and the town of Bloomsburg. This will afford local officials an opportunity to plan their local highway expenditures more efficiently. Source of Funds (Dollar Amounts In Thousands) 1968-69 1969-70 Estimated Increase Expend.

In addition, special and centralized departmental serv- ice functions are provided through Motor License Fund expenditures for the following: Fiscal Management, Internal Audits, Management Methods, Per- sonnel, and Office Services. The major increase is caused by the consolidation of the bad check audit section in the Internal Audits Division. This required transferring eighteen people onto this complement from other Bureaus within the Depart- ment. One additional personnel analyst is recommended.

It seeks to achieve this objective through effective coordination of its mandated responsibilities: through a careful qualification of motor vehicle operating and registration privileges; through a program of education and information designed to promote safe driving habits, and by withdrawing the operating privileges of those operators whose incompetence, carelessness or irresponsibility has led to accidents or is likely to do so. The activities of this program are: to administer the Driver Point Sys- tem; to license and supervise the Official Inspection Stations and to conduct the State vehicle inspection program; to examine applicants for operator licenses who are handicapped or on parole status; and to maintain a Public Education and Information Section designed to promote traffic safety through- out the Commonwealth. In addition, the Bureau must supply certain informa- tion in the form of certified copies of records of traffic accidents to other agencies both within and outside the State. The budget amount will provide funds for implementation or expansion of the following activities: improved qualification methods for inspection me- chanics, review of medical cases by the Medical Advisory Board, pilot design of an improved driver testing facility, and expansion of Driver Improvement Schools.

There are 123,000 permits issued annually to distributors which have been increasing at the rate of 5 per cent per year. The annual audits of distributors and motor carriers are approximately 3,010 per year. The amount budgeted will cover the cost of carrying present program forward at its present level.

The 20 I Motor License Fund Non-Highway Bureau maintains \"across the counter\" service in Harrisburg for immediate processing of all types of applications. Due to the increasing number of motor vehicles owned and operated in Pennsylvania, the Bureau's workload is increasing at the rate of 4 per cent per year, as shown below: 1967-68 1968-69 1969-70 Certificates 5,900,000 6,000,000 Name and address changes 200,000 250,000 280,000 renewals 5,000,000 5,100,000 5,200,000 Registration stickers 4,000,000 4,050,000 4,100,000 Commercial 875,000 Correspondence and rejected applications 2,000,000 2,050,000 2,100,000 The amount budgeted reflects a $1,000,000 decrease in salaries and em- ploye benefits that will occur when the Graphotype Division is abolished on June 30, 1969. The computerization of vehicle registrations will begin in the Spring of 1969 and the 241 positions in this Division will no longer be needed. Increases over the estimated expenditures of 1968-69 include: $200,000 in employe benefits caused by the addition of retirement and life insurance; $126,000 in postage costs; $75,000 in office rental and other supplies expenses; and $200,000 for the increased cost of carrying present complement forward.

The first phase was to develop an Operators' Licensing System. This phase in- cludes operator licenses, learner permits, change of name or address, and duplicate requests and stops against the file. The program was expanded and now includes the Traffic Safety Exam Program, Traffic Safety Point System, Traffic Safety Accident Reporting System, Revenue Personnel and Pennsyl- vania Internal Revenue Service File lists. Beginning in March, 1969, the motor vehicle registration renewals will be done by computer rather than by the Graphotype Division in the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. This will require an additional 89 data recording ma- chine operators and tabulating machine operators at a cost of $200,000. In order to convert the five million registration cards from Graphotype to computer operations it was necessary to enlist an outside firm. The 1969-70 cost of this conversion contract will be $1,168,000. Additional computer machine rentals due to this and the other increased workloads will require an amount of $1,500,000 over the 1968-69 Budget.

The Liquid Fuels Tax is an excise tax imposed upon all liquid fuels used or sold and delivered within the Commonwealth. The Tax, ultimately borne by the consumer, is imposed upon and collected by the distributor. After discounts, all monies collected are placed in the Motor License Fund, except that an amount equal to one-half cent per gallon is placed in the Liquid Fuel Tax Fund. Fuels sold and delivered to the U.S. Government and those under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution of the United States are exempt from payment of the tax. In addition to these exemptions, reimburse- ment is made for fuels used for certain agricultural purposes. The permanent rate of the Liquid Fuels Tax, presently, is seven cents per gallon. The Fuel Use Tax is a tax levied upon all dealer-users for the use of fuels within the Commonwealth other than fuels taxed under the Liquid Fuels Tax Act. All monies collected, less allowance discounts, are paid into the Motor License Fund and the Liquid Fuels Tax Fund in the same proportion as the Liquid Fuels Tax monies. Exempt under this tax are fuels under Com- merce Clause of the Constitution of the United States, fuels used and sold iby the Commonwealth and any of its political subdivisions, fuels sold and delivered to the U.S. Government, fuels (less than 50 gallons) brought into the Commonwealth in the fuel tanks of motor vehicles and fuels used for certain agricultural purposes. The permanent rate of the Fuel Use Tax, presently, is seven cents per gallon. The Motor Carriers Road Tax Act levies a tax on motor carriers operat- ing commercial motor vehicles with more than two axles and truck tractors. The tax rate is seven cents per gallon computed on the basis of the number of gallons of fuel used within the State. In addition, the act requires identi- fication markers for each vehicle, except vehicles registered in Pennsylvania to be issued annually upon payment of a $2.00 fee per vehicle. Interstate Bus Compact\u2014Fuels Tax is a tax imposed on fuel consumed by interstate buses under compacts entered into with other states to avoid multiple taxation of fuels. Taxes in each state are computed on the basis of the number of gallons of fuel used within the state. The present tax rate is seven cents per gallon. 27 Motor License Fund Revenues MOTOR LICENSES AND FEES Motor Licenses and Fees Actual Commonwealth receives revenue from the licensing, and collection of fees levied for the registering and titling of motor vehicles and for the issuance of learners permits and operators licenses. The major revenue producers are fees for the registration of vehicles, the issuance of operator licenses, certificates of title and transfer of registration.

The Game Commission is an administrative commission consisting of the Board of Commissioners, six regional offices, six game farms and the Howard Nursery. The Commission conducts seven major programs: Execu- tive and Administrative; Information and Education; Propagation; Research; Law Enforcement; Training, and Land Management. The administrative and operational activities of the Game Commission are financed from the Game Fund, Federal funds and miscellaneous sources.

The annual Farm Show affords the State's farmers an opportunity to competively display their highest quality agricultural products, to observe the most modern farm equipment, supplies and techniques and to attend meetings of agricultural organizations to dis- cuss mutual interests and problems. The Farm Show also provides an op- portunity for the general public to observe the scope, diversity and importance of agriculture as part of Pennsylvania's total economy. The program also manages and maintains the State Farm Show complex which consists of the main exhibition building, large and small arenas, a boiler plant, a parking lot and various smaller barns and buildings. In addition to the annual Farm Show, other major agricultural events held annually at the Farm Show complex include the Livestock Show, Open Dairy Show and Junior Dairy Show, all of which receive Commonwealth support which is described under the Department of Agriculture in the General Fund Budget presentation. Other major non-agricultural events in- clude the Shrine Circus, Mobile Home Show and Sportsman Show. The budget provides for continuation of this program at the present level.

The State Harness Racing Commission, a departmental administrative commission within the Department of Agriculture, consists of three members who are appointed by the Governor with the consent of the Senate. The State Harness Racing Commission maintains its headquarters in Harrisburg and has full-time personnel assigned to each track before, during and after each harness racing meet. The program activities include promulgation and enforcement of rules and regulations designed to protect the public and individuals involved in harness racing from undesirable persons and practices. To maintain honest and safe racing conditions, the Commission maintains its own security force, analyzes urine and saliva samples of horses, and licenses and supervises all drivers for qualifications and fitness to participate in the sport. The Commission also licenses all harness racing horse owners, racing association and concession employes, officers, officials and such other persons in an official capacity or employed at the track. The Commission also conducts hearings and may revoke or suspend a license and/or impose a fine for infractions of the law or official rules and regulations. The law permits the Commission to license five harness racing corpora- tions and grant annually up to 62 days of racing per corporation. There are presently four corporations granted 248 days of harness racing. They are: Liberty Bell Racing Association and William Penn Racing Association, conducting their meets at Liberty Bell Park in Northeast Philadelphia; the Washington Trotting Association, holding its meet at the Meadows, Washing- ton County; and Pocono Downs, Inc. located in Plains Township, Luzerne County. It is anticipated that a fifth corporation will be licensed in the near future. The Commission also administers the Pennsylvania Sire Stakes program which is financed from a restricted receipt. The budget provides for the expenses of supervising a fifth track.

He is keeping that commitment. This is the first five-year financial plan to be presented in the history of Pennsylvania. As a matter of fact, the first in the nation. This is a new ex- perience and a difficult one. The art of forecasting with any degree of ac- curacy will take some years to perfect. The five-year data should therefore be evaluated accordingly. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ALL ASSUMP- TIONS ARE READ BEFORE FORECAST EXPENDITURES ARE AP- PRAISED. The four years of forecast have been based upon the Operating Budget presented for fiscal 1969-70. Only the financial cost of those programs that have been recommended in this year's operating budget have been included in the forecast. This is not meant to imply that we have discontinued the consideration and development of any new programs but only reflects the adoption of a policy of not including such programs in the four-year forecast. An example of the kind of program that is presently under consideration but not included would be mandated kindergarten or pre-school instruction. A significant amount of evaluation and study is necessary before we could propose such a program for the Legislature's consideration. The benefits of this kind of planning are evident to almost everyone. We know how important it is to plan effectively in our own individual lives. When we are dealing with levels of expenditures of such a magnitude, there is no longer any room for doubt. We must plan if we hope to fulfill our re- sponsibilities to the citizens of the Commonwealth. Institutions that depend on the Commonwealth for support should find this forecast particularly useful. They will be able to know what the Ad- ministration proposes for the five years ahead and they will be able to adjust their plans accordingly. Misunderstandings and lack of communications will be minimized, and those people responsible for expansions of institution pro- grams will be better able to review their needs to see if they are in ac- cordance with the stated Commonwealth plan. This is absolutely essential when planning for activities which will also require the construction of facil- ities having a life of twenty, forty or even sixty years. The adoption of this planning device should draw the attention of our citizens to the issues that require their attention and an expression of their wishes. For example, the Master Plan for Higher Education in Pennsylvania requires some charting of the future of community based higher education facilities. The community colleges, branch campuses, and extensions of State universities all must plan for the orderly development of necessary facilities to meet the needs in the years ahead. We have obligations to see that this expansion is prudently planned. It must be recognized that the four-year forecast differs from the Operat- ing Budget in the degree of certainty upon which many of the assump- tions are based. Factors beyond our control, such as the economic health of the Nation and of the State, the forecast of personal income and economic growth, the level of job opportunities available and the effects of inflation are difficult to project. When the 1970 census is completed, we will have better basic information upon which to make our projections. In the interim years we cannot expect the degree of accuracy to be as satisfactory. We intend to update the four-year forecast every year when the annual budget is submitted. This will enable us to chart our progress in a more comprehensive manner. The observations of groups such as the Common- wealth Priorities Commission, the Governor's Tax Study and Revision Com- mission, the Economic Advisory Council and other significant advisory re- ports have been useful in the development of this document. ft 11 11 1 GENERAL AND SPECIAL FUNDS FIVE YEAR BUDGET SUMMARY STATE FUNDS ONLY (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) DEPARTMENT 1967-68 Actual 1968-69 Estimated 1969-70 Budget 1970-71 Estimated 1971-72 Estimated 1972-73 Estimated 1973-74 Estimated Office of the Governor ......... $ 4,202 $ 5,420 $ 7,211 $ 8,100 $ 8,500 $ 9,200 $ 9,700 Office of the Lieutenant Governor 70 85 108 100 100 100 100 Department of the Auditor General 4,444 4,462 5,230 5,500 5,700 6,000 2,109 2,373 2,629 2,500 2,600 2,700 2,700 Council of Civil Defense _..._ .... 248 325 420 400 400 400 400 State Civil Service Commission 140 170 200 200 200 300 300 Department of Commerce 25,468 26,386 51,648 6,300 6,500 6,700 7,000 948 1,037 1,031 1,072 1,066 a a laa 1111, NIP IIIIP a 11111 a 11111111 a a a a In a VIM a a a S sma sgo ow to eve so MI Ca CM ee eat MI 1967-68 Actual 1968-69 Estimated 1969-70 Budget 1970-71 Estimated 1971-72 Estimated 1972-73 Estimated 1973-74 Estimated Department of Mines & Mineral Ind. $ 5,211 $ 5,052 $ 6,988 $ 7,300 $ 7,700 Parole 2,708 3,120 4,142 4,700 384 432 480 500 500 500 600 Administrative Miscellaneous & Comm 2,722 1,963 746 Banking Department Fund ______ 1,925 2,161 2,569 2,400 2,500 2,700 2,800 Milk Marketing Fund 372 173 470 413 411 497 540 State Farm Products Show Fund _ 324 367 429 340 350 374 397 State Harness Fund ______ 6,935 6,791 REQUIRED The five-year financial statement reflects the asumption that this $492,593,- 000 revenue gap for 1969-70 will be financed for that fiscal year. It is further assumed that additional revenues will be enacted in accordance with the guidelines included in the Governor's Tax Study and Revision Com- mission's final report. This means that a personal income tax will become a source of revenue. Based on these assumptions the revenue gaps for the years 1970-71 ($66,800,000) thru 1973-74 ($272,800,000) can be financed thru relatively minor adjustments of business and consumer taxes. (Note from financial statement that annual growth in revenue sources, new and old, is already reflected in the calculations.) It must be recognized however that the five-year financial plan is based on programs included in the 1969-70 budget. Present indications are that there are new programs the State will have to finance and administer in the near future. Some examples are: Subsidizing cities for municipal overburden. Expanded financing of urban basic school systems. o Mandated kindergarten. Greatly expanded high school guidance counseling. o Quality assessment of basic education. Transportation\u2014ports, high-speed and mass transit (expansion beyond current levels). o Restructuring of local governments. o Expansion of State employe benefits to include unemployment compensa- sation etc. o Expansion of welfare programs particularly in the areas of mental health and Pennsycare. o Environmental pollution control. Sound estimates for these programs are not available. And it must be recognized that this list is not meant to be all-inclusive. The cost ranges somewhere between $100 and $400 million. It is expected that some financing of state government costs will come from federal tax sharing in the near future. Certainly some of the above programs will be fully or partially financed from federal funds. There will be a need, however, for additional State funds above and beyond those out- lined in the five-year financial plan to support whatever new programs are adopted.

I i I I I I I I i GENERAL FUND I EXPENDITURE PLAN I 1 I I i I I i I Governor's Office The activities of the Governor's Office are not interrelated and a pro- jection will therefore not show uniform growth. A normal expansion is anticipated in Executive and Administrative ac- tivities since this reflects the increasing need of the Governor for staff services. The initiation of a Planning Programming Budgeting System will require the Office of Administration to have a more specialized capability to provide the Governor and Legislature with sophisticated analyses of the effect of appropriations and new programs. An increase in technical personnel has therefore been projected for the next five years. The Human Relations Commission is the area of most rapid expansion. In line with the increased responsibility for determining full compliance with Federal and State Civil Rights Laws, the Commission is projecting a need for a much increased field staff of Human Relations Representatives. The activities of the State Planning Board reflect the expanded long range and in-depth planning now being done by all Commonwealth agencies. The initiation of the Planning Programming and Budgeting System requires the Planning Board to make more frequent analyses of such statewide data as population growth trends, shifting industrial areas, recreation areas, etc. It further requires them to develop and coordinate the efforts of local and regional planning agencies. The Council on the Arts is projecting an increase over the next five years primarily for grants-in-aid to foster the growth of local arts organiza-tions. The State has been able to offer only token aid to date while concen-trating on promoting local and regional arts festivals and collecting the necessary data for an evaluation of the state of the arts in Pennsylvania. It is expected that the Public Employes Relations Board will be created this year, and will expand to a staff of fifteen in the next five years. IMO GS VMS Gill a Sig S Siv a GS GOD IGD CIS GO C.

The number and length of audits varies in direct proportion to the amount and number of appropriations made by the Legislature, therefore any projection of future costs to the Department is a reflection of the activities of other Commonwealth agencies. Present resources should enable the Department to keep the workload current for 1969-70; however, in the succeeding four years an increase in complement and related expenses is projected. The expansion will occur principally in the department audit division of the Executive and Adminis-trative Program and also for Public Assistance Audits.

A. normal expansion is anticipated in Executive and Administrative activities since these include, among other things, the cheek-writing function. As \"expenditures of other agencies increase, additional demand is placed upon the level of service provided by this Department. The computerization of the check writing and disbursing functions for Public Assistance payments will allow expenditures for this program to de-cline slightly and then to level off. The computerization is now in process and by the end of 1969-70, district disbursing offices at Scranton, Philadel-phia and Pittsburgh will be closed and all checks mailed from Harrisburg. Most other areas of the Department will remain relatively stable with the exception of Interest and Sinking Fund Requirements. This activity will reflect rapid expansion as General Obligation bonds are issued to finance increased activity in the areas of capital construction, transportation as- sistance, Project 70, Land and Water Development and Vietnam Veterans' Bonus. It is anticipated that this method of financing, made possible as a result of the recent Constitutional Convention, will reach a level of $99,100,000 by 1973-74.

Within the next two to three years, the Meat and Poultry Hygiene Act of 1968 should be fully implemented.

Greater emphasis will be placed on improving the socioeconomic conditions of farm and rural communities. A new rural development program will be established to identify rural needs, determine resources available to meet these needs, develop alternative corrective measures, and implement approved new programs. Present market development programs will be expanded and new ones created to increase Pennsylvania's share of the do-mestic and foreign agricultural products market which has been rapidly increasing. To encourage effective soil and water conservation, additional financial assistance will be provided to local soil and water conservation districts.

This includes the coordination of State, county and local activities associated with warning, communications, shelter, radio- logical defense, fire police, rescue, medical, welfare and other emergency services essential to the maximum practical degree of safety for all Penn- sylvanians. The budget includes no funds for emergency operations or disaster relief activities of major proportions. The primary objective is development of a basic, statewide emergency organization capable of protecting life and property in natural disasters or in event of enemy attack. Assuming there will be no major and lasting increase in international tension and no threat of imminent attack, it is believed that continuance of the current basic civil defense program, without major modification or expansion, will effectively protect life and property in emergencies.

The Five Year Budget assumes only a normal growth in personnel needs with no substantial addition to the number of covered classes. The 1969-70 budget provides for the full annual cost of computerizing the Commission's testing and scheduling operations and for microfilming all civil service employe records. The figure for 1969-70 also provides for a new test evaluation unit to revise test material to eliminate material which improperly discriminates against the disadvantaged. The projected budget provides for a new unit in the Commission to provide assistance to local government in establishing merit systems. The budget also provides for opening walk-in testing offices in Erie (1970-71), Scranton (1971-72) and Williamsport (1973-74). a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a SS a a MIMI GM 10111 Sal MN 1111111 IIIIII lila SIM 12112 a MN Bea a ea STATE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1967-68 Actual 1968-69 Estimated 1969-70 Budget 1970-71 Estimated 1971-72 Estimated 1972-73 Estimated 1973-74 Estimated General Government $ 140 $ 170 $ 200 $ 200 $ 200 $ 300 $ 300 Total State Funds $ 140 $ 170 $ 200 $ 200 $ 200 $ 300 $ 300 Augmentations .......... 965 1,287 1,541 1,600 $1,800 $2,000 $2,100 $2,200 Complement General Government 159 171 190 208 225 230 238 Department of Commerce The Department of Commerce is charged with the responsibility to im- prove the economic growth of the Commonwealth by creating a higher level of employment through the development of a healthy business climate. The Department has set forth three specific goals to achieve during the period 1969-1974. These are maximizing personal income, assuring full employ-ment and providing a broad range of economic opportunity for all Penn- sylvanians. Increases in the General Fund budget for the next five years are re- quired to cover the expansion of the Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority financing program for new job-producing plant locations. In light of the Federal government's ruling eliminating the tax-free status of revenue bonds, PIDA becomes more important. Tourist Information centers to help bolster the three billion dollar travel industry are also included, as is enlarging of the travel advertising program. The Five Year Budget projection also provides for the following pro- grams: 1. Industrial Development Assistance will increase in 1970-71 based on the 1970 census and will continue to increase as the per capita rate is raised from $.05% to $.09. 2. Site Development will increase to provide for. additional water and sew-age facilities and access roads to serve industrial sites. 3. Tourist Promotion Assistance will increase as a result of the change to the 1970 census base. 4. The amounts recommended for the American Bicentennial Celebration will provide funds for various promotional programs to be undertaken by the Pennsylvania Bicentennial Commission and for capital planning and construction by the Philadelphia Bicentennial Corporation. The costs of the bicentennial to be financed through this appropriation are only those that do not relate to a regular program of the Commonwealth. 5. The Science and Engineering Foundation will be increased to meet the demand for grants among universities and research and development firms for exploring the new science and technology. SP A 1111.

DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE MAJOR PROGRAM DETAIL INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT LOANS (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) CO 1967-68 1968-69 Actual Estimated Industrial Development Loans ...... $18,600 $18,600 The Federal Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968 removed the tax-free status of industrial revenue bonds, thus practically eliminating them as a source of funds for industrial development. Therefore PIDA must be the financing vehicle for industrial location in Pennsylvania. The Depart- ment assumes that $100 million per year is the maxi- mum saturation level for new and expanding industry, 1969-70 1970-71 1971-72 $50,000 $55,000 $60,000 and this level should be reached by 1974-75. The above projection is based on the amount of new money needed each year to reach a $90 million level by 1973-74, and the calculations include the amount of interest and principal repayments that will be received and available for financing the program each year.

The Five Year Budget provides for the development of these programs to capacity. The Department of Community Affairs has developed three primary goals for their program activities. First is the correction of environmental problems of slums and inadequate housing, mass transportation, and recrea- tional facilities. The major new program in this area results from the findings of the Governor's Housing Task Force. The Department will become involved in the development and administration of a program of sales, rental, and ex- perimental housing throughout the Commonwealth. This program will be one of the largest in the Department in terms of dollars invested. It also will be one of the most important from the standpoint of its effect on people by the upgrading of the living environment and standards for the persons involved. The greatest growth program in this area will be Recreation Assistance which will increase as local governments develop facilities through the Land and Water Development Fund. The Redevelopment and Mass Transporta- tion programs have reached the maximum volume that local resources can absorb and therefore will remain relatively constant through the five year period. to The second goal of the Department is the development of the capability of the unemployed and underemployed to reach a better life situation through various training programs. The five-year budget reflects a continued effort to meet this goal. The third and probably most vital goal of the Department is to increase the capacity of local government institutions to solve their own problems. The report of the Governor's Priority Commission has indicated that much em- phasis should be given to education of local government officials and also to technical assistance to municipalities in all areas of services and facilities. It is probable that the Department will undertake programs of financial aid to communities to assist in meeting increased service demands, although this has not been reflected in the five-year forecast. Special programs of this type will be developed upon implementation of the new local government article of the Constitution. so a a nos a no a nu a one WI 11111111 111N1 a la ell a 111111 111111 11111 1.111a Me MI Mg ENS EOM DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY AFFAIRS (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1967-68 Actual 1968-69 Estimated 1969-70 Budget 1970-71 Estimated 1971-72 $ 1,177 $ 1,864 $ 3,044 $ 3,400 $ 3,800 $ 4,100 $ 4,400 Housing Assistance 13,000 13,000 15,000 15,000 15,000 Pennsylvania Housing Agency ._ _ 2,000 Redevelopment Assistance 14,350 26,450 30,000 32,000 34,000 34,000 34,000 Community Recreation Assistance 500 2,000 4,000 5,000 5,000 Mass Transportation Assistance 8,900 8,900 12,536 13,000 15,000 16,000 17,000 Employment Assistance 6,000 6,000 6,000 6,000 6,000 6,000 Community Action Grants 3,000 Regional Councils 25 30 200 400 600 800 Charter Commission Studies 25 30 200 200 300 400 Partner Cities 400 400 400 400 400 Planning Assistance 590 1,000 1,200 1,300 1,500 Planning Revolving Fund _ .... ... $84:500 Federal 480 462 500 600 600 600 Augmentations 198 160 100 100 100 100 Department Total $27,728 $43,942 F69,162 $71,800 $80,700 $83,400 $85,200 Complement General Government 173 222 295 333 356 366 379 - DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY AFFAIRS MAJOR PROGRAM DETAIL HOUSING ASSISTANCE (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) Housing Assistance 1967-68 1968-69 Actual Estimated 1969-70 1970-71 $15,000 $15,000 $15,000 The Housing Assistance Program will operate out of a PIDA type revolving fund. Forgivable loans will be made for: (1) Sales housing through which units will be purchased, rehabilitated and resold for at least the purchase price, but not more than purchase price plus rehabilitation costs. (2) Rental housing through which funds will be loaned to preplan multi- unit projects for financing under FHA loan guarantee. with loans being recovered upon final FHA approval after a period of 8 to 12 months. The revolving fund should reach a level of $50 mil- lion which should be phased-in over five years. Thereafter approximately $10 million annually will be needed to underwrite the unrecoverable cost which is estimated now to be roughly 20 per cent. a a a a IIIIIII Ma a a ela a a a IIMI Oa MB ea =MO alla MN EOM Ma MGM Mae DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY AFFAIRS MAJOR PROGRAM DETAIL REDEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1967-68 1968-69 1969-70 1970-71 1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 Actual $14,350 $26,450 $30,000 $32,000 $34,000 $34,000 $34,000 The level of redevelopment activity will remain erate increases have been provided to cover land ac- constant through the five year period, however mod- quisition and demolition costs which will increase.

Oa Sanaa el a a a a a a IIIIII a CO CO Forests and Waters During the next five years the Department of Forests and Waters ex- pects to expand the Commonwealth recreational program and increase revenue producing timber sales. Expansion of the recreational facilities will include addition of modern water and sewer systems, increased picnic and camping areas at the exist- ing State Parks, Pymatuning Reservoir and the Commission State Parks, and the development, construction, operation and maintenance of recrea- tional facilities at new State Parks. The timber marketing activity, for the sale of State owned timber, will increase expenditures $200,000 to $250,000 and produce one million dollars additional income for the General Fund. The Federal-State-local flood control project at Chartiers Creek will be continued with significant State support. The Federal Government will expend in excess of 15 million dollars on this project.

Emphasis will be placed upon the planning, budgeting and management information processes with the intent of improving the delivery of health services. A reduction of fifty percent in the incidence of tuberculosis is anticipated over the next ten years. In addition, greater emphasis will be placed on drug regimen resulting in the reduction of patient population for the department's two remaining TB hospitals. There is a decrease in funding for the School Health Examinations pro- gram because the latest student enrollment projections depict a decrease from 2,885,900 students in 1969 to 2,758,200 students in 1974. It is expected that increasing demands for water brought about by popu- lation growth, technological changes, and recreation will create an even greater need for improved management of the State's water resources. New industrial processes and the expanded use of fossil fuels for power generation will increase the degree and complexity of air pollution in the Commonwealth. Significant defects in housing are present in congested urban centers and in older communities. According to the 1960 census there are 800,000 sub-standard dwelling units existing in Pennsylvania. It is anticipated that increased attention will be given to eliminating these unhealthful conditions. 11111 a 1111111 OM Ile a IIIO 01 MO Mill a NM 0 MB OIN unsimenewas ea a gam OD es ms em ree 8117 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1967-68 Actual 1968-69 Estimated 1969-70 Budget 1970-71 Estimated 9,900 10,900 12,000 13,000 Sewage Facilities Planning Grants ... 343 500 100 100 100 100 Sewage Facilities Enforcement 25 160 IGO 200 200 100 100 Solid Waste Disposal Planning Grant 250 400 100 100 100 Housing Hygiene _ 1,800 2,500 2,500 3,000 3,600 Total Augmentations $55,702 Advisory Institutions 988 992 1,003 991 981 . 3,249 3,251 3,252 Ni Historical and Museum Commission The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission maintains and operates the State museums and historical properties through which Penn- sylvania's historical heritage is conserved and promoted.

A normal expansion of the Executive and Administrative activities of this Commission is anticipated. This activity includes the State Archives. As the County Records Committee and the Local Records Committee fully implement their programs to provide for retention and disposition of local and county records, increased costs will occur in this program. The museum activity will expand with the addition of the Anthracite Museum Complex and the Port of History Museum. Additional acquisitions and improvements to other State-owned museums and properties will con- tribute to increases in this program.

Insurance Department The major objectives of the program are to examine and supervise domestic insurance companies, settle complaints and regulate insurance rates and policies. Over the next five years it is anticipated that additional legislation will be enacted giving the Department broader responsibility to control the in- surance industry. Additional insurance company examiners will be needed to implement Act No. 205, signed by the Governor July, 1968, which requires that every domestic insurance company be examined during the first five years of its existence. In addition it is anticipated that at least 200 domestic insurance companies will be examined on an annual basis. The Bureau of Rates and Policies reviews for approval or disapproval all insurance policy contracts or certificates covering life, health, accident, per- sonal liability, and all forms of casualty insurance. The present complement of 37 meets present program objectives, but enactment of legislation regulat- ing automobile insurance policies and creating the Pennsylvania Fair Plan will require additional technical personnel over the next five years. In summary, all areas and divisions of the Department are expected to have moderate growth as the responsibilities of the Department to the in- surance public continue to increase.

These two programs expect to increase significantly their activities over the next five years. The Juvenile Court Judges Commission does not project any major in- creases for its operating program, but there will be an expansion of its grant program to improve county juvenile probation services. The Com-mission expects to support the addition of 120 new positions to county staffs over a five year period with funds provided by a Federal grant. State funds will be used to expand training programs for juvenile probation officers. The State correctional institutions will strive to improve their rehabili- tation and treatment programs. Plans have been developed to close the State Correctional Institution in Philadelphia during 1969-70, however the Eastern Diagnostic and Classification Center will remain in Philadelphia due to the proximity to institutions of higher learning from which treatment personnel are recruited. Plans for a new center and special treatment facility, either on the old site of the correctional institution or elsewhere in Philadel-phia, are being explored. The Bureau of Corrections has established two new programs, Regional Correctional Facilities and Pre-Release Centers, for 1969-70. The two pro-grams will be significant additions to the State's correctional system and will provide more coordination between State, local and community agencies. Additional mobile forestry camps are included in the Bureau's five year plan. Three more camps are anticipated, which will bring the total number of forestry camps to 10. These additional camps will be tied either to an ex-isting correctional institution or to one of the new regional correctional facilities. 11111110111111=11101111111111112111101INIMIN1111111141111aMMINIM a a OS IS a MO a MSS a EMI a a 1.11 1110 a 111111 1110 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (Dollar Amounts in 1967-68 1968-69 Estimated 1959-70 I3udget 1970-71 Estimated Government $ 2,496 $ 3,249 $ 4,077 $ 4,400 $ 4,800 $ 5,100 \u00a7 5,400 Juvenile Court Judges Commission 61 85 115 100 200 200 200 State Correctional Institutions - 19,486 21,268 24,320 23,700-1 25,900 28,000 30,000 Improvement of County Juvenile Probation Services 840 1,100 1,300 1,500 1,600+ $29,352 2,400 2,400 2,400 2,400 Augmentations 1 3 196 200 200 200 $24,630 $31,150 $34,800 $37,400 of State Correctional Institution at Philadelphia. t Program previously in Department of Welfare.

The Crime Commis- sion will continue to develope new legislation; collect criminal intelligence data; and provide coordination between Federal, State and local programs. Special units will be created in the Office of Criminal Justice to collect information and investigate organized crime and major frauds. The General Crimes Unit within the Office of Criminal Justice hopes to develope a reservoir of legal research material that will help prosecuting attorneys throughout the State and will provide advisory services on a 24 hour-a-day basis for both the district attorneys and major police depart- ments. A 24-hour advisory service will also be estab- lished to assist the State Police with legal consulta- tion and tactical field problems. Over the next five years, the Bureau of Criminal Justice hopes to develope a complete system of crim- inal justice statistics. This will provide the data neces- sary for an intelligent analysis of the problems and of the possible methods of reducing crime.

The Consumer Fraud Act, signed into law at the end of 1968 provides fines, imprisonment or both, for those found in violation of the Act and gives the Attorney General power to subpoena witnesses and records, if fraudulant ac-tivities are suspected. This will greatly expand the Bureau's ability to reduce instances of consumer fraud and misrepresentation. The Bureau of Consumer Protection also intends to expand the area of consumer education. An intern program has been developed by the Bureau and Pennsylvania State University, offering a semester of practical training within one of the Bureau's offices for future teachers of consumer related studies. Semi-nars, radio, television and speaking appearances will be increased. A movie is being prepared to explain the Bureau's activities to the consumer. There are also plans to develop special literature and possible course material for high school students. NJ Department of Labor and Industry The activities of the Department of Labor and Industry are directed to- ward sustaining personal economic well-being, maintaining a favorable labor management environment in the Commonwealth and insuring the main- tenance of safe and sanitary working conditions for employes of business and industry. In addition, the Department strives to enforce health and safety standards for the protection of the general public. The activities of the present programs will remain relatively stable, and will require only a modest increase in personnel primarily in the areas of apprenticeship promotion, health and safety enforcement and mediation services. It is assumed that the Occupational Disease program will provide in- creased benefits to pension claiments beginning in 1970-71 with an increase in monthly benefits from $75 to $100, and payment of funeral benefits. The cost in this program should peak during 1971-72 and decrease slowly there- after as the number of persons on the payroll begins to decline. In an effort to assure a personal income to more Commonwealth citizens, the Department will expand its vocational rehabilitation services to persons deemed handicapped by reason of age, low education attainment, ethnic and cultural factors, prison or delinquency or other related conditions. In addi- tion, it is assumed that the Bureau of Employment Security will fully imple- ment the Work Incentive program which is aimed at providing job training and placement to persons receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children. alie a 111 a 11111 IIIMI a a MIIIM INII Mill a 1111 MEI MN a a IMO 111 a SI a IMP NMI Mil al Mil a a IRMO Mal al ENE a a DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND INDUSTRY (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1967-68 Actual 1968-69 Estimated 1969-70 Budget 1970-71 Estimated 1971-72 Estimated Estimated Estimated Government $ 5,562 $ 6,564 $ 7,638 $ 8,100 State Funds _ $52,205 S 57,945 $ Complement General Government 832 869 890 909 926 938 946 t Funds for the Second Injury Account have been included in the figures for this program.

Financing repairs of the armories at the level of one million dollars a year shohld continue so that the renovation program of these antiquated structures may be sustained to provide adequate facilities for training and housing the Pennsylvania National Guard. Natural disasters or civil disorders, which would require additional ex- penditures on the part of the National Guard, are not anticipated in this projection.

The first area of concern will be the strict enforcement of laws per- taining to deep mine safety, the initiation of new laws regarding dust control to prevent miners asthma, and additional regulation of the use of high voltage electricity in coal mines. The five year budget includes funds for expansion of the dust count program currently operated by the Department. Secondly, the Department will emphasize strict enforcement of con- servation laws concerned with the prevention of surface subsidence, the drilling and plugging of oil and gas wells to prevent stream pollution, treat-ment of mine refuse banks to prevent air and water pollution and bank slippage, and the reclamation of active strip mines. The budget projection assumes enactment of an \"all-surface mining\" law to be effective in 1970-71. The third area of concern is the restoration of abandoned coal mines to remove the hazards and to allow for the economic regeneration of the coal area. Finally, the Department will continue to emphasize the research pro- grams to perfect new safety and dust control devices and to develop new or more economical means of eliminating air and water pollution resulting from mining operations. se a a Mao silb a nil el5 a MI M=1\\ is se as so ea am es mis ESS les sir a es me a sem= DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND MINERAL INDUSTRIES (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1967-68 Actual 1968-69 Estimated 1969-70 Budget 1970-71 Estimated 200 200 200 Mining Area Restoration\u2014Projects 1,739 1,100 1,500 1,600 1,700 1,800 1,900 Coal Research 282 350 350 400 400 400 500 Transfer to Bituminous Coal Open Pit Mining Reclamation Fund _.. 425 416 504 700 700 800 800 Transfer to Anthracite Coal Open Pit Mining Reclamation Fund _ ..... _ 68 126 142 100 200 200 200 Transfer to Coal Lands Improvement Fund 200 200 200 200 Total State Funds $5,211 $5,603 296 315 326 332 336 336 Board of Probation and Parole The primary objective of the Board of Probation and Parole will con- tinue to be the improvement of parole and probation services within the Commonwealth. An increased need for both State and county services can be expected if the shift from institutional to community supervision con- tinues. A greater use of pre-sentence investigations and special investigations by the courts is also expected. To assure the continued progress in meeting the Board's objectives and to assure the effectiveness of the Commonwealth's parole and probation serv- ices over the next five years, the Board of Probation and Parole will continue to emphasize special training programs for its field staff and for county per- sonnel. The Board also hopes to eventually reduce the caseload of its field staff to 35 per agent, excluding investigations, as recommended by the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice. The increased interaction between State and county parole and proba- tion services is expected to continue, both in the area of joint training pro- grams and in the Board's grant program. There appears to be a trend in the courts to make more use of probation as an alternative to institutional confinement. This will place a greater burden on the counties since they must supervise the majority of probation cases. An increase in re- quests by the courts for pre-sentence investigations will also fall mainly to the counties. The Board of Probation and Parole, through its grant program to improve county probation services, will help the counties meet their in- creasing responsibilities by providing funds for additional professional per- sonnel. By 1973-74 the grant program will support a total of 254 positions. During this time pre-sentence investigations are expected to double, but the added positions will allow for a decrease in the caseload of the counties' pro- bation agents.

The five year budget projection takes into account (1) the need for increased subsidies to improve and maintain the basic educational system, (2) the assumption that elementary and secondary enrollment will level off in this periofl, and (3) that State tax resources will not be available for large increases in support for higher education. The major portion of the Department's budget is for support of the public school system. The five year projection for support of public schools is based on the assumption that recent changes in the subsidy law will be- come effective in the 1969-70 fiscal period and will require sizeable increases in 1969-70 and in succeeding periods. The projection also provides for the educational needs of the disadvantaged in our cities and represents a con- tinuing effort of State support over future years. There is one issue in education for which no allowances have been made in the five year budget. This is the matter of mandated kindergarten which, in the thinking of many educators, is one of the major issues in edu- cation which will have to be faced. The projections of departmental expenditures provide for minimal pro- gram expansion beyond 1969-70 and reflect the assumption that school en- rollments in public elementary and secondary schools will level off during this five-year period. a a a la a a Ile ale SIP SNP MR IND SI NIP dal UM IND MIN a MSS 111111a Sea MI INS The main issue in higher education is whether or not increasingly larger amounts of State resources can be granted in future years. The fiscal pro- jections include minimal increases for present programs at State Colleges and State-Related Universities and for future reduction of maintenance aid to State-Aided higher educational institutions, with an accompanying phase in of aid for graduate programs as suggested in the Master Plan for Higher Education. The cost of this graduate support as well as the cost of additional support for new and expanded graduate and undergraduate education as recommended by the Governor's Priorities Commission has been projected. The overall assumption which forms the basis of the five year estimate for higher education is that so-called \"free education\" at the collegiate level, similar to what we now have at the public elementary and secondary levels, will not exist during this period.

The percentage in-creases were varied in order to make the apportion-ment of State funds more equitable among the col-leges. Added to that were amounts for support of new and expanded undergraduate programs in pro-portion to the amounts recommended for that purpose for 1969-70. The total recommended amount for these undergraduate programs in 1969-70 is $4.775,000. The projections were made in accordance with the assumption that the State Colleges (Indiana Uni-versity of Pennsylvania excepted) will retain their status as colleges and will not attain university status. If in the future the amounts provided for these institutions are inadequate, upward adjustments may have to be made in fees charged to students.

To project the actual instruction expense per pupil in the future years, a factor was calculated based on experience which would reflect the increased per pupil cost of instruction due to teachers' salary incre-ments. In addition to this, an amount was added which reflects the additional cost as a result of the teachers' salary increases required by Act 96. It was assumed that the historical relationship between re-linbursable instruction cost and actual instruction expenses per weighted average daily membership would continue in the future. Future reimbursable instruction cost per WADM were therefore projected on this basis. In the 1973-74 fiscal year, however, the State's share of reimbursable instruction cost per WADM reaches $275. This being 50 per cent of the maximum payable reimbursable instruction cost it was assumed that the reimbursement to school dis-tricts would not increase beyond this point. The $275 reimbursable cost was then used in projecting the sub- sidy through the 1973-74 fiscal year. The Weighted Average Daily Membership was estimated based on Pennsylvania's present population and the school sys-tem's present WADM. In computing the density and sparsity factor reimbursements allowances were made for the increase in WADM, the increase in expendi-tures and the increase in the maximum allowable re-imbursable instruction costs. In addition, provision was made for the additional instruction expenses which will be experienced by Philadelphia and Pitts-burgh since those districts are not subject to a reim-bursable maximum. The projection for vocational ed-ucation was based on conservative requirements for mandated reimbursments to school districts for voca-tional education classes and reimbursement for the construction of vocational educational facilities. The estimates of the requirements for construction were based on present planning and also on the estimated need for such facilities in the future. 0111111110021111141111111041101111Thillrnallill OS MS 11111 ES MN SIM a ell ONO Oil NMI SIM IMO IMO EN IMO ONO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION MAJOR PROGRAM DETAIL RENTALS AND SINKING FUND REQUIREMENTS (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1967-68 1968-69 1969-70 1970-71 1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 CA Actual Estimated Budget Estimated Estimated Estimated Estimated Rentals and Sinking Fund Requirements $45,200 $50,000 $79,315 $ 64,000 $ 90,000 $ 98,000 $110,000 In computing the Commonwealth's reimbursement for construction of school buildings, it was assumed that the construction of new facilities will continue in the future at a declining rate. In addition, provisions for Act 96 were made which includes: a choice of reimbursement on either the aid ratio or capital ac- count reimbursement fraction basis; reimbursement for future construction at an expense per pupil ca-pacity level which is $700 higher than the maximum under the present law; and provision for at least 50 percent reimbursement for construction in densely populated school districts.

Funds were distributed for new and expanded under- graduate and graduate programs in the same propor- tion as recommended for these institutions in 1969-70. 11111 a a ENO a 411111 11101 a111111a NIP a a a a a 11111P a ma MIS NMI MIMI /MI Mal SIM NEI UM MS Oa ICI WM MEP OM OM a a MEI CS Public Utility Commission CO The Public Utility Commission is responsible for the enforcement of the Public Utility Law thereby providing protection to the citizens and the public utility corporations of the Commonwealth by ensuring that safe and adequate utility services be available at fair and reasonable rates.

The total direction of the Commonwealth's mental health/mental re- tardation services is in a state of change. Community services will develop and expand. This will have the effect of bringing more people in need of care into the system\u2014but these people will largely remain in the com- munity, served by local care facilities. Also, as these community services are developed, more of the patients in the institutions may be released to community care. Off-setting this decline is the cost of improved care for institutionalized patients and the continuing pressure for expanded residential care for the mentally retarded. The Medical Assistance (Pennsycare) Program must be expanded to provide for the basic health and mental health needs of the lower income citizens and to meet Federal requirements. It is also assumed that the State General Hospitals will approach total financial self-sufficiency by 1975. This is possible because of the income derived by these hospitals from the Federal \"Medicare\" program and the State Medical Assistance program. It is anticipated that there will be an annual increase in the monthly average number of persons receiving cash assistance payments through 1972-73. Thereafter, the higher assistance standards, intensified services, and work- training programs are expected to effect a decrease in public dependency. Co During the fiscal periods from 1969-1974, the objective is to develop a modern standard of allowances which recognizes changes in the essential items of living. It is further intended that this revised standard be main- tained through adjustments to the allowances to compensate for changes in the cost of living. The institutional program for delinquent youth should remain relatively stable with increased emphasis being placed upon the development of a wider range of non-institutional services. Legislation will be introduced to consolidate the County Child Welfare service with other Child Welfare services, such as aid to families with de- pendent children in Public Assistance. This change along with the re- structuring of the present Department of Health and Public Welfare into a Department of Human Service would produce additional Federal dollars to support the basic needs of the citizens of Pennsylvania as well as providing a better coordinated and viable system of human services. Finally, it is our intention to change the concept of institutions from single-function units to comprehensive human service treatment centers. There, a wide range of the mentally and socially disabled who need to be away from their homes will be cared for according to their individual treat- ment and rehabilitative needs, rather than according to the legal and soCial labels which are presently the basis of our institutional organization. The human service treatment centers will provide a wide range of services in- cluding: care and treatment of children and adults with mental health and mental retardation disabilities; rehabilitative services; and reeducation treat-ment of young people with behavior disorders. The goal will be to place persons in residential care according to their needs and to speed return to normal living where possible. 11111 IIIIII a 1111111 111111 1110 MIN INIM a a OM 1151111 Ina DEPARTMENT OF (Dollar Amounts 1967-68 1968-69 Actual Estimated PUBLIC in Thousands) WELFARE 1970-71 Estimated 1971-72 Estimated 1972-73 Estimated 1973-74 Estimated 1969-70 $ 7,710 $ 7,576 $ 9,835 $ 10,400 General Hospitals __________-- 14,648 11,174 3,516 2,400 2,000 1,700 1,600 Restoration Centers ___________ 292 274 756 800 900 . 1,000 1,100 Institutions for the Mentally Ill and ........... 128,342 142,097 _ 688 712 832 900 900 900 1,000 Eastern Mental Health Center ____ 1,416 1,111 1,198 1,200 1,200 1,300 Student Nurses 2,776 Community Services for the Mentally Ill and Mentally Retarded 11,733 12,987 2,481 2,700 3,000 3,300 3,600 Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic 2,500 2,500 2,500 2,900 3,300 3,600 4,200 Northeast Mental Health Clinic 50 150 Community Mental Health Facilities 956 991 Grants to Communities for Services to the Aging 275 300 300 800 1,300 1,800 2,300 Chronic Disease Hospitals _____ 537 ' 537 427 400 400 400 400 Beacon Lodge Camp 13 a a a 1111 a OW a MB a a elle a a 111111 111111 11115 sin 111111111.11.11111111111.11111150111,110111110111111111.111.

It is estimated that the present population of 30,000 will drop by 800 patients per year to a total of 25,000 in-patients by 1973-74. At the same time the out-patient population is expected to slowly decline from its present level of 20,000 as the counties are able to implement services under the Community Services for the Mentally Ill and Mentally Retarded program. The projection assumes a continued increase in the in-patient population of 12,000 in the institutions for the mentally retarded as facilities become available. This need is expected to continue and the present bed capacity will be increased to 18,000 within 10 years. This is based on the standard of 150 in-patient beds per 100,000 population. Due to the long term nature of care for the mentally retarded, the out-pa- . tient population is expected to continue at its present level in spite of the newly developing community programs. The number of employes at the institutions for the mentally ill and mentally retarded is expected to in- crease by 500 new employes yearly for the fiscal years 1970-71 thru 1973-74. Based on the above projected population trends this will provide an average ratio of 1.3 patients for each employe for the institutions for the mentally ill, and a ratio of 1.7 patients for each employe for the institutions for the mentally retarded. The increase in needed funds is based on the cost of the new positions, plus an increase in the quality of care, treatment and rehabilitation provided in the in- stitutions. a a a SIM MI a a MI a WO a SIM 1110 a a a a a gm IS MI MIN IIMI INIII 1/1111 INII INS a 111111 111. a Me 0111.

This projection assumes that there will be a 24 per cent increase in the average monthly caseload during the five year period as follows: Fiscal Year caseload for the base year of 1969-70 includes an estimated 436,100 persons who will participate under the present program plus an additional 25,000 persons who will be eligible when the grants are increased from 90 per cent to 100 per cent of the minimum standards for health and decency. The caseload increase projected for the next five years is based upon many factors which go beyond . the traditional relationship between the rise and fall of unemployment in Pennsylvania. Raw income data, nationally and in Pennsylvania, have always revealed a potentially eligible caseload that was not on the rolls. Several factors which could only be certified by considerable field study appear to be causing an increase in the number of persons re- ceiving public assistance: As people come for medical assistance and food PUBLIC ASSISTANCE (Cash Grants and County Administration) stamps, they discover that they are eligible for cash grants. The civil rights movement, the \"poverty\" pro- gram including the development of \"Welfare Rights\" groups, and the activity of the 0E0 legal service groups made more people aware of their potential eligibility. The nature of the population, including such factors as an increasing number of single-parent families. The Public Welfare Department, for many years, with variances among counties, applied the eligibility regulations in a manner which kept eligible people from the rolls. The emphasis is now shifted to sensitize staff to put premium on ensuring a person's right to assistance rather than keep it from him. It may be possible that the factors that have caused an increase in the caseload during the last few years represent the picking up of long-time eligibles who had never applied and that the situation will even out. If the potential eligibles have not yet been absorbed, the person load will continue to rise. Continuing emphasis will be placed on rehabilitative counseling, referral, and casework services to help the maximum number of beneficiaries to achieve financial and social inde- pendence. As a result of this emphasis, it is estimated that the caseload will reach a peak of 587,300 in 1972-73 and decline to 572,300 in 1111OMMIIIIIIIIIMM was 111113 111, MEMO a 11111141111111111 Medical Assistance DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WELFARE MAJOR PROGRAM DETAIL MEDICAL ASSISTANCE (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1967-68 1968-69 1969-70 1970-71 1971-72 1972-73 $ 77,600 $ 93,200 $ 98,800 XIX of the Federal Social Security Act re-quires that high quality medical care must be provided under a State program of medical assistance for all economically deprived persons by 1975. In order for the Commonwealth to provide high quality medical care it is anticipated that the follow-ing improvements must be added to the current medi-cal assistance program. 1970-71 Add dental care for the medically needy, ($1,769,000). Add corrective glasses, ($756,200). 1971-72 Increase fees for physicians services ($4,500,- 000). Increase fees for dental services ($750,000).

The projected costs are based upon continuing the program at the present level with a slight increase in the number of children served and for the increased cost of providing care. It is assumed that the demand for child welfare services will grow as the child popu- lation grows over the next five years. Not included in the projection is the Department's plan to merge and coordinate these Child Welfare Services with other Family Service programs for chil- dren, particularly the Public Assistance program of financial aid to families with dependent children. The program support for these services has been combined at the State Headquarters level. The next step is to combine and administer the actual delivery of these services at the local level. Legislation will be intro- duced before the end of the five year period to ac- complish this objective. Revenue Department The primary .objective of the Revenue Department is to collect all General Fund tax levies and various fees due the State. The effect of new or revised tax levies upon collection methods or costs has not been taken into consideration. An increase in the number of taxpayer accounts is anticipated based upon population increase and expanding business activity. An outside consulting firm currently is conducting a thorough systems analysis and review of the major tax collecting bureaus. Although this analysis may result in administrative changes in the methods and techniques of collecting and auditing taxes, conclusions have not been sufficiently final-ized to be projected in the five-year budget. An electronic data processing center will be created in 1970-71 to aid in the billing and record keeping functions. While the initial cost will be high, it is anticipated that there will be a savings in personnel and other auditing costs in the following years. The major advantage a computer will offer will be a complete audit of Sales and Use Tax returns. Institutional collections will continue to expand due to the increased demands for accounting information and data required for Medicare and Pennsycare reimbursements. The personnel and expenditures required to collect Inheritance taxes are included for the first time in the 1969-70 budget. There will be little increase in the next five years in this program. Funds have been provided in the Revenue Department's five year pro- jection to provide for the expense of establishing a State income tax collection unit should one become necessary.

The amount budgeted is based on the volume of petitions anticipated in favor of taxpayers resulting in part from several adverse court decisions. The major amount is due to the court decision that na- tional banks are not liable for the State Sales Tax and therefore the State will have to refund all such moneys collected. It is anticipated that an amount of $18 million will be required during 1969-70 and 1970-71.

State Police The activities of the State Police are currently undergoing rapid expan- sion to meet the rise in crime and traffic accident rates. Continued increases in the enlisted trooper complement of the State Police are projected for the next five years along with increased expendi- tures for substation construction and rentals, increased patrol fleet vehicles and maintenance expenses, expanded communications facilities and enlarged training facilities and programs Three new secondary crime laboratories are scheduled to be established over the next five years in order to meet the rising demand by state and local officials for laboratory analysis of criminal evidence. This program is eligible for Federal matching funds under the Omnibus Crime Bill. The State Police aircraft program was begun in 1968-69 with the pur- chase of 2 helicopters. It is anticipated that this number will expand to 8 in the next 3 years. This program is eligible for Federal matching funds under the National Highway Safety Act. A new statewide radio communications system, having an annual lease cost of $3.5 million, will be installed during 1969-70, and a computerized data information system will become operational in 1970-71. The State Police plan to recruit and train civilian communications specialists to operate the system during the next four years. The new program for eighteen and nineteen year old State Police Train- ees is expected to begin with a class of 150 during 1969-70. The Department's five year projection anticipates a class of this size to be trained each succeed- ing year. These youths are being offered this two-year course to prepare them for admission to the State Police Training Academy. tril glea CI= C=I Oa GM ail SI IS OM a 1101 aim a a mo WC MEI 1111111 Mil EMI IIEll a a la pa OM IS MUM a PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE 1967-68 Actual (Dollar Amounts 1968-69 Estimated In Thousands) 1970-71 Estimated 1971-72 Estimated 1972-73 Estimated 1973-74 Estimated 1969-70 $12,800 $14,400 $15,900 The State Tax Equalization Board provides administrative support to the Department of Public Instruction by certifying annually the aggregate market value of assessed taxable real property throughout the Common-wealth for use in determining the amount and allocation of Commonwealth subsidies to school districts, for use in determining State support of public libraries, and determining certain tax limitations.

All employes would receive at least a 10 per cent increase on that date. A general salary increase is essential in order for the Commonwealth to remain competitive with business and industry, the Federal Government, and other public employers, as well as to keep pace with the steeply rising cost of living. To remain competitive during the five-year period, it is estimated that additional five per cent increases will be necessary on July 1, 1972 and on July 1, 1973.

The five-year financial plan assumes that the increase in licenses and fees defined in the Special Fund Budget Volume III will be enacted in 1969. State Highway and Bridge Authority borrowing through general obli- gation bonds whenever possible) will continue to be used to finance con- struction. All other Special Funds remain in balance for the five-year period without adjustments in revenue sources. 1 1 1 120 Motor License Fund The Department of Highways is charged with the task of providing a system of highways for the fast efficient and safe movement of individuals and cargo within the Commonwealth. To perform this task the Department is concerned with present and future traffic needs. In the event of a Penn- sylvania Department of Transportation, the Department of Highways will work in conjunction with other modes to provide an integrated system of transportation. In this manner all transportation facilities will be coordinated in an effort to solve the ever-increasing traffic problems in the urban areas. Program increases for the five year period are basically in the production activities of Construction, Right-of-Way and Engineering. Administrative cost increases are projected as minimal. The construction program is now in the process of changing its focus. With the Interstate System expected to be completed in the early to mid 70's, there is now concern with the development of the primary, secondary, and specifically the urban systems. With the pressing need for urban develop- ment the highway system must be interfaced with a total transportation system. Improved services are to be provided through specific Right-of-way pro- grams. Appraisers are instructed in more equitable assessment procedures. Each person contacting property owners is specially trained to assure that they can explain the relocation services available and to provide adequate assistance to those who want it. The Department is upgrading its design and research functions. This will provide departmental personnel with the skills to perform more complex duties and eliminate the need for much of the costly consultant work. Although the percentage increase in road mileage is small, there will be a substantial increase in the maintenance program as new standards and better maintenance procedures are developed. There is an increased em- phasis on safety and economy in the areas of structure, condition of the roadways and materials. Sophisticated testing procedures are being ex- plored and implemented to provide increased proficiency to yield safer and better roads. The cost projections reflect the continuation of the Six-Year Program approved by the State Highway Commission. It assumes additional revenues provided by an increase in license fees or liquid fuels taxes. This will im- plement the Spot Improvement Program in compliance with the increased emphasis on safety. Programs financed by the Motor License Fund but located in depart- ments other than the Department of Highways, will, for the most part, reflect a normal extension of the trend of past years. Requirements for the Treasury Department will increase primarily as a result of debt service for additional bonds issued for highway construction. General State Authority rentals will continue a slight expansion in the De- partment of Property and Supplies for projects currently under construc- tion with authority funds. Subsidy payments to school districts, through the Department of Public Instruction, will increase sharply with an increase of students taking Driver Education courses. This is assumed in light of legis- lation proposed to require all new driver license applicants to have completed an approved driving course. Expansion within the Department of Revenue will be minimal and will reflect the implementation of computerized vehicle registration and increased efforts in highway safety. Continued expansion of the State Police traffic activities and the trooper complement will require additional funds each year. All of these program activities will complement our road-building effort to provide an improved and safer highway system for the motoring public. 121 MOTOR LICENSE FUND FINANCIAL STATEMENT 1967-68 Actual 1968-69 Estimated 1969-70 Budget 1970-71 Estimated 1971-72 $ 1,159 $ 200 $ 1,000 $ 900 $ 200 a a a MIN a aIle a MI IS 111111 111111 Milt OM MS MIN IS 11111 Ole MI SIM Oilli MI SS NW a S a S SIMa a a a 111115 111, MOTOR LICENSE FUND 1967-68 Actual Department of Highways (Dollar Amounts 1968-69 Estimated in Thousands) 1970-71 Estimated 1971-72 Estimated 1972-73 Estimated Estimated 433,500 $ 433,100 $ 429,200 - $709,493 $833,423 4,853 $ 11,917 $ 20,700 $ 31,400 $ 44,400 $ 56,800 Department of Property and Supplies _ 2,300 1,603 1,606 1,700 1,700 1,800 1,800 Department of Public Instruction _ 2,994 3,675 3,989 4,400 Game Fund The Game Commission activities will continue at the present level during this period.

Over the next five years it is anticipated that some expansion will be required to maintain adequate regulation of banks. While the number of unit banks decreases steadily each year, the number of branch banks in- creases rapidly and total assets have increased at the rate of approximately 1 billion dollars annually over the last five years. The staff required to regulate the Consumer Credit Agencies should re- main relatively stable for the next five years. However, should the Uniform Credit Code be enacted in the Commonwealth and supervisory responsibilities be placed in the Banking Department there would be a substantial increase in the work load and staff requirements. Taking into consideration the beginning balance for each fiscal year and the prospective lapses in the annual appropriations, it is anticipated that the estimated revenues will be adequate to finance the program.

However, such decline will be minimized since milk marketing is becoming more complex. For 1970-71 and 1971-72, provisions have been made for an extensive cost analysis of the receiving, processing and distribution of fluid milk. In the fiscal years following the completion of this cost analysis a reduction in the number of Board employes is anticipated. 41111 a a a S INS al a MS IIMB a a 1111, 11111, a 4111 Mal ISO a SS IMO a SS a MS a SS ail MD SS MS OS a CND CSI MILK MARKETING FUND FINANCIAL STATEMENT (Dollar Amounts in Thousands) 1967-68 Actual 1968-69 Estimated 1969-70 Budget 1970-71 Estimated 1971-72 1,229 Surplus $ 95 $ 34 S 20 S 70 S 120 $ 90 $ 16 MILK MARKETING FUND I-A (Dollar Amounts In Thousand ) Milk Marketing Board 1967-68 Actual 1968-69 Estimated 1969-70 Budget 1970-71 Estimated Estimated State Funds $370 $171 $ 398 $ 337 $ 331 $ 372 $ 366 Augmentations 450 750 550 687 719 680 689 $921 $ $1,052 $1,055 Other Departments Treasury Department ......... $ 2 $ 2 $ 2 $ 2 $ 2 $ 2 $ 2 General Salary Increases 70 74 78 123 172 FUND TOTAL $822 $923 $1,020 $1,100 $1,130 $1,177 $1,229 Complement Milk Marketing Board _ 91 89 90 89 86 84 na a le NM MO NW MI Slil Will a a =I MI a MIN Ma State Farm Products Show Fund Only normal increases to meet regular operating and maintenance ex-penses are expected during the next five years.

Normally, three-fourths of all monies derived from harness racing and not required for administrative expenses are transferred to the General Fund. Temporarily, however, until such time that the Horse Racing Fund surplus is sufficient to provide $10,000,000 or until the time the surplus from both the Horse Racing Fund and Harness Racing Fund is sufficient to pro- vide $10,000,000, three-fourths, or as much as may be required, will be trans- ferred to the Non-Public Elementary and Secondary Education Fund. It is anticipated that in 1969-70 the entire three-fourths of the Harness Racing Fund surplus will be transferred to the Non-Public Elementary and Secondary Education Fund and that beginning in 1970-71 the entire amount. will be transferred to the General Fund.

In keeping with this Administration's dedication to fiscal responsibility, the following schedules of actual and esti- mated revenues indicate the anticipated five-year revenue yield to the Commonwealth based upon the existing provisions of the revenue structure for the General Fund and Special Revenue Funds. Since many of the General Fund revenue sources are intimately related to trends and fluctuations in the national economy, those economic indicators exerting the greatest influence upon revenue flows were taken into consid- eration in developing these revenue projections for the next five years. Another factor of prime importance is the economic impact of the Vietnam War. It is generally assumed that the conflict will not be resolved in the immediate future. However, most experts agree that when an end to the hostilities does finally occur, there will be no immediate detrimental impact upon the economy. Instead, with the help of intelligent economic planning by the Washington administration, the return to a full peacetime economy will be a gradual, controlled process. Other considerations of these direct economic guideposts include the following assumptions: 1. Consumer prices will continue to rise, but at a relatively slower rate than experienced during the current year. If inflationary pressures are brought under control, an annual price level rise of less than 3 per cent and perhaps as low as 2 per cent can reasonably be expected. 2. National productivity in terms of the real output of goods and services is expected to increase at an annual rate of 4 to 41/2 per cent over the next five-year period. 3. For this same period, the growth of other national economic indicators such as Personal Income, Corporate Profits, etc. are expected to increase at related rates. 4. All pertinent indicators point toward a five percent annual rate of growth of total General Fund revenues over these years. 5. An amendment to the Constitution of Pennsylvania provides that gross receipts taxes paid to the Commonwealth by public utilities shall be in lieu of taxes on real property paid to local taxing authorities. Moreover, the Commonwealth is required to distribute gross receipts revenues to the local subdivisions in an equitably proportional ratio to the real prop- erty taxes they would have otherwise received. Accordingly, the net gross receipts revenues over the next five years have been adjusted downward to reflect this development. 6. By the 1970-71 fiscal year, the proceeds from the State Horse Racing program are expected to reach a level that exceeds the mandated require- ments for aid to non-public education. The Miscellaneous Revenue pro- jections have been adjusted to reflect the transfer of these excess revenues into the General Fund from the State Horse Racing Fund. 7. The Special Revenue Funds included in this five-year financial plan are not as greatly dependent upon trends in the national economy as is the General Fund. Therefore, except as noted above, the increase of revenues for these funds over the next five years is primarily based upon the normal rate of growth experienced in the past. 149 SI MS OMB ElNB la 0

which is the fifth of the Executive Budget series, outlines the 1969-70 Capital Budget as recommended by the Governor, and the fore- cast of capital requirements for the ensuing four years through 1973-74. This Five-Year Financial Plan is one of the principal goals of the Shafer Adminis- tration and represents one of the significant achievements of this Administra- tion. It is essential to consider all of the financial needs of the Commonwealth, whether those needs are in a category designated as \"operating\" needs, or whether they represent expenditures for assets which have a long life, com- monly referred to as \"capital\" expenditures. Ways must be found to finance both types of State expenditure, and prudent fiscal management dictates that consideration be given to the impact on the Operating Budget by projects in- cluded in the Capital Budget. If the cash requirements of the Capital Budget are met by the issuance of bonds, it follows that these bonds must be retired by appropriations from the Operating Budget. These commitments will have a significant financial impact over an extended period of time. We have ac- cordingly included in the Capital Budget a forecast of cash requirements for each of the four ensuing forecast years for expenditures as well as noting the requirements necessary to retire the bonds. This document also includes information required by amendments to Pennsylvania's Constitution which were adopted in 1968. These Constitu- tional changes were intended to establish a realtistic limit on the borrowing authority of the Commonwealth. The limit is set at 1.75 times the average yearly tax collections over a five-year period. This eliminates the necessity of resorting to the device of creating authorities to finance capital expendi- tures. Debt which is self-liquidating and debt approved by the voters in a referendum are excluded from the debt limit, as is debt incurred to suppress insurrection or rehabilitation of areas affected by disaster. The adoption of amendments to Article VIII of the Constitution, Section 7 (4) (d), provides that \"the State Treasurer shall set apart from the first revenues . . . a sum sufficient to pay such interest and installments of prin- cipal\" for the fulfillment of obligations on Commonwealth borrowings. This provision should enhance the marketability of Commonwealth General Obli- gation Bonds, and will no doubt be recognized as one of the most signficant changes to the Constitution. Any debt incurred for capital improvements must be amortized over a period of time which does not exceed the useful life of the improvement. The Pennsylvania State Planning Board recommends a Capital Program to the Governor for the ensuing year and for the four years of the forecast. The Bureau of the Budget participates in the hearings with the State Planning Board. The recommendations of the State Planning Board are considered by the Bureau of the Budget together with information that has been developed during the formulation of the Operating Budget. Also considered is the general economic and financial condition of the Commonwealth and the limits of borrowing available after considering the information furnished by the Auditor General. Recommendations are then made to the Governor for his consideration prior to the development of the Capital Budget and Four-Year Capital Plan. The Governor then selects the capital projects to be constructed after he has had the opportunity to review the entire fiscal condition of the Com- monwealth and to investigate the benefits and cost of the capital requirements as they are reflected in the Commonwealth's program plans. Included in the grand total of construction which is forecast in this docu- ment is construction for the Fish Commission, Game Commission and some projects for the Department of Highways that will be financed through cur- rent revenues. II II II II For 1969-70, project authoriations totaling $961.3 million have been in- cluded in the Capital Budget. Of this amount $927 million will be financed through bond funds and $34.3 million through current revenues. This volume consists of five sections: BUDGET MESSAGE\u2014The Governor's Executive Budget Message is in- cluded in this first section. STATEMENTS\u2014This section includes all statements that reflect the projected effect on the Commonwealth's debt, cash flow, authorizations for capital projects and schedules of cash requirements and expenditure fore- casts for agencies responsible for the completion of projects. 1969-70 PROJECTS\u2014This section includes information relative to the recommended 1969-70 projects financed from either bond funds or current revenues. For each project a base cost is indicated which reflects anticipated price increases up to the probable project bidding date. Not included in the base cost are architectural fees, contingency funds, administrative costs, and other small miscellaneous expenses which must be added to the base project cost to compute the total cost of a project. A separate column is included showing the total cost of these items for each project. 1979-74 PROJECTS\u2014This section contains a forecast of capital improve- ments to be initiated during each of the succeeding four years, 1970-71 through 1973-74. These estimates are based upon the Five-Year Capital Program submitted to the Governor by the State Planning Board, and the budget fore- casts of the various departments. The projected figures represent the best available estimate of project authorizations that will be needed to meet Penn- sylvania's future capital requirements. EXPENDITURES\u2014Since construction generally is not completed during the fiscal year in which a capital project is initiated, cash payments for the cost of construction usually will occur in succeeding fiscal years. This section provides an estimate of cash expenditures for capital projects during each of the next five years. This forecast contains estimated expenditure patterns not only for projects recommended for 1969-70 and the succeeding four years, 1970-71 through 1973-74, but also for projects previously authorized. Projects in this section are divided into five broad Commonwealth cate- gories . The categories are Education; Health and Welfare; Recreation, Natural and Historical Resources; Protection of Persons and Property\u2014Public Build- ings; and Transportation. In order to facilitate an easier understanding of exactly which operating departments are contained in each category, the following groupings are presented for identification: Education State Colleges and University State Schools State-Related Universities Community Colleges Recreation, Natural and Historic Resources Agriculture Fish Commission Forests and Waters Game Commission Historical and Museum Commission Health and Welfare Health Public Welfare Transportation Highways Commerce (TAA) Community Affairs (TAA) Protection of Persons and Property\u2014 Public Buildings Civil Defense Justice Labor and Industry Liquor Control Board Military Affairs Property and Supplies Revenue State Police iv Each year the Commonwealth must appropriate moneys to cover Gen- eral State Authority and State Highway and Bridge Authority rentals pro- vided under the Authority Act. During 1969-70 appropriations in the amount of $67.9 million for GSA and $30.0 million for SHBA have been requested to rent all projects completed or to be occupied through that year. The total estimated rental of the entire program, currently authorized will reach ap- proximately $68.1 million for GSA and $39.4 million for SHBA by 1972-73. This would then be the annual amount required until some of the earlier leases expire. We have made available in this document significant quantities of addi- tional information and material relative to the expenditures of the Common- wealth for capital purposes. This is in accordance with the Administration's policy of providing in these basic documents all of the information that we feel would be necessary and desirable by the Legislature in order to properly appraise the Governor's recommendations. It is hoped that by so doing de- lays that resulted from requests for additional information in the past will be avoided and the entire process of considering these important matters will be expedited. We are welcoming any suggestions on improvement of these docu- ments. A corollary goal was to make these documents understandable and clear to the average citizen in the Commonwealth in order that those persons having an interest might be able to be completely informed and that our fiscal responsibility would be conscientiously fulfilled. II II II II GLOSSARY OF TERMS Base Cost\u2014Amount initially estimated to be expended for construction of a project. This figure does not include the acquisition cost of land nor does it cover design, administration, contingency, or other miscellaneous costs. Bond Issues\u2014Issues of long term obligations in alphabetical series having maturities of as long as 30 years with varying interest rates over the life of the issue. These have the full faith and credit of the Commonwealth in accordance with Article VIII, Section 7 (4) (d) having a guarantee that revenues be set aside for their retirement. These constitute the major source of funds for the Capital Budget. Capital Project\u2014As defined in the \"Capital Facilities Debt Enabling Act of 1968\" \"Capital Project\" means and includes any building, structure, fa- cility, or physical public betterment or improvement; or any land or rights in land; or any furnishings, machinery, apparatus, or equipment for any public betterment or improvement; or any undertaking to con- struct, repair, renovate, improve, equip, furnish or acquire any of the foregoing, provided that the project is designated in a capital budget as a capital project, has an estimated useful life in excess of two years and an estimated financial cost in excess of seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000), and shall include projects to be financed by the incurring of debt. Contracting Agency\u2014Department or agency that is responsible for adminis- tering the construction of a capital project. Current Revenues\u2014Monies derived from current tax sources rather than bond issues. Current Revenue sources which finance a portion of the Capital Budget are the Motor License Fund receipts, the Fish Fund and Game Fund operating revenue. Expenditures\u2014Payments made in connection with project construction during a certain period of time. The term should not be confused with authoriza- tions. Authorization can be given for a capital project, but no actual expenditure of funds may be necessary until work begins on the project. Project Authorization\u2014Refers to the approval by the General Assembly of a defined project listed with its total estimated cost. 1 vi EXECUTIVE BUDGET MESSAGE GOVERNOR RAYMOND P. SHAFER Mr. Lieutenant Governor, Mr. Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Gen- eral Assembly: Today I am submitting for your approval Volume V of the Executive Budget-the Capital Budget and four-year forecast of expnditures for capital projects. This completes one of the most comprehensive and significant documents ever prepared by the Commonwealth. It is designed to help us look ahead and consider the financial implications of our blueprint for investment in Excellence for Pennsylvania. In this Volume V you will find capital projects specifically itemized by purpose and the proposed sources of financing each. For the first time we have brought together in one place capital projects and construction including Highways, Bridges, Commonwealth's share of construction cost of community colleges, transportation assistance and insti- tutional type investment requirements. We have also carefully calculated the new Constitutional Debt limitations in order to be assured that our suggested plan is well within these restraints. Included in the five-year plan You will find all of the following type facil- ities for the benefit of Pennsylvania and its citizens: \u2014Hospitals for the mentally ill and retarded. \u2014Facilities for children and youth who require physical and emotional attention and treatment. \u2014Educational classrooms, research learning centers, dormitory and dining hall facilities and necessary utilities so that our quest for more opportunities for intellectual development for the youth of Pennsylvania may be realized. \u2014Highways and Bridges and other Transportation requirements necessary to enable Pennsylvanians and visitors to safely and quickly reach their destina- tions. With modern roads and alternate means of transit, tourism and eco- nomic development will be encouraged and stimulated. \u2014Our magnificent State parks and natural beaches, marinas and swim- ming facilities are being improved, extended and preserved for our use and that of our children. \u2014Similarly, flood protection and our long range clean water needs are being prudently safeguarded through projects included in this Budget. ....With crime and safe streets everyone's concern, attention is given to correctional institutions necessary for the maintenance of a system of justice in our society and the rehabilitation of all that indicate hope. \u2014Regional offices to assist the agricultural community in all of the pro- grams designed to stimulate the production and marketing of Pennsylvania's outstanding food and dairy products. In fiscal 1969-70 it will be necessary to issue bonds amounting to $410 mil- lion. This will be needed to support estimated expenditures of $557.3 million of which $475.5 million will be drawn from bond sources. The total issues of new bond obligations over the five-year period 1970 through 1974 are estimated to amount to $2.828 billion. During the same period, $346 million of Commonwealth indebtedness will be retired. II II vii The grand total of new project authorizations requested and recommended in fiscal 1969-70 is $961.3 million. Almost $623 million (64%) of this total State funds is represented by projects of the Department of Highways. A sig- nificant adjustment downward is forecast in this category where estimates have been projected of $245 million in 1970-71 increasing to about $275 million by 1973-74. The year immediately ahead demands almost 30% of the five-year total of $3.2 billion in capital requests. We should perhaps discuss the fiscal re- straints which now prevail due to the Constitutional changes of 1968. While the outstanding debt is climbing from a July 1, 1968, estimate of $1.35 billion to a June 30, 1974, total of $4.15 billion, a tripling in five years, this amount is still well within the permissible debt ceiling as specified by the Constitution. We are just just under half (49.7%) of the debt limit by June 30, 1969, and will be just over three-fourths (78.3%) of this ceiling by June 30, 1974. This is due to the fact that our forecast of the average tax revenues, used as the base, is estimated to rise from about $2 billion in fiscal 1968-69 to $3 billion in 1973-74. Without a flexibility wherein the authorized debt can float with the level of tax revenues, the Commonwealth would have reached the debt ceiling in only five short years. However, caution and prudence must still be the hallmark of our fiscal policies since all debt incurred obligates future generations and also carries an interest cost. Cognizance must be taken of the necessity to retire such debt through the timely and prompt repayment of bondholders. The confidence of the financial community in the Commonwealth is strong now and this must be continued. Total debt service as shown in the forecast climbs from $117.8 million in 1969-70 to $266.0 million in 1973-74. Provision for these requirements is shown in the Operating Budget. Estimates appearing in Volume IV are somewhat lower than these latest estimates which have been adjusted to reflect recent trends in interest rates. In future years we intend to close the 90 day lag in the preparation and release of the Operating and Capital Budgets. This will be another step in the process of improving the financial management techniques. The Planning, Programming, Budgeting System includes the close coordination and evalua- tion of both the operating and capital needs of the Commonwealth. Long Term debt is not the only financing method planned in the Capital Budget. We will finance about $34.3 million of projects for the Fish and Game Commissions and the Department of Highways through current revenues. The General State Authority continues to be shown as the principal construction agency of the Commonwealth. General obligations issued for purposes of financing construction work for which this agency is responsible have been shown as their bond issues for clarity of presentation. It is intended to issue Commonwealth obligations in the future whenever possible rather than Authority Bonds. A continuance of the dramatic improvement in the ability of the General State Authority to plan, design and construct increased volumes of new fa- cilities is reflected in the Budget. Expenditures are estimated to increase from just over $200 million in fiscal 1969-70 to a level of $320 million by 1973-74. The Highway and Bridge Authority shows a similar pattern of continued improvement in all areas of highway construction management. Its expendi- ture pattern shows growth from $234 million (State funds only) in 1969-70 to almost $312 million by 1973-74. viii 1 I. 1 Increase in capacity to competently plan, design, construct and inspect capital projects is in the best interest of the people who will be served by these facilities and the over-all financial burden is reduced when delays are avoided. The financial cost climbs significantly when inefficient management delays the completion of major capital construction projects. We are, there- fore, well pleased with the achievements in improved performance of all Com- monwealth construction agencies in the last few years. The major areas to be benefitted by the requested 1969-70 Capital Budget are summarized as follows: Transportation $635,739,000 66.1 percent Education 219,717,000 22.9 percent Health and Welfare 44,709,000 4.7 percent Natural and Historic Resources 27,561,000 2.9 percent Law, Order, Safety 24,971,000 2.6 percent All Other 8,598,000 .8 percent II $961,295,000 100.0 percent Because of the nature of the transportation projects, direct comparisons of amounts suggested to be approved in this Budget would not be meaningful. The other classifications indicate that education will be receiving substantial amounts for an increase in facilities to strengthen programs that will attract new and expanded industries and that will retain the best of our youth in this State. The accompanying document will provide further information on specific amounts recommended for the State Colleges and University, and the State-Related Colleges. Most of the structures and improvements recom- mended in this Capital Budget plan will provide benefits for the people of Pennsylvania for decades to come. The decision to accept this Capital Budget and forecast is an important one and upon it will hinge the maintenance of the momentum that Pennsyl- vania has developed. We are committed to a continuance of this momentum and we believe that the people of Pennsylvania share in these expectations and commitments. There is an urgency for prompt action to adopt authorizing legislation for the 1969-70 fiscal year, particularly as it pertains to the Commonwealth's ability to issue bonds. Building and highway projects will be in process at the end of this fiscal year, and there will be cash requirements necessary to fund those projects shortly after June 30, 1969. It is important, therefore, that authorizing legislation be passed by June 30, 1969 to avoid any delay or work stoppages of projects. II II II II Ii ix S 4Iar1c1snh1 ft e ts 3 11 11 IP Computation of Debt Limit and Outstanding Debt The accompanying exhibits reflect a projection of the Commonwealth's Con- stitutional debt limit. The starting point for the projection is the average tax revenues for the years 1963-64 to 1967-68 and the debt limit and outstanding debt as of June 30, 1968. These are shown as certified by the Auditor General on November 12, 1968. Bonds and notes already issued since June 30, 1968 and those to be issued during the remainder of this fiscal year total $355,330,000. Bond and note retirements during 1969-70 equal $37,650,000. Revenue projections are based upon estimates shown in Volume IV, Five Year Budget. Projections have been made for all sources of funds included in the Auditor General's calculation for June 30, 1968. Deviations exist between this presentation and that shown on page 96 of Volume I. This presentation is based upon more recent information, and is to be considered more accurate. Future bond issues shown in the exhibits are in amounts required to support the projects requested in this Capital Budget for 1969-70 and those projects an- ticipated in future fiscal years. It is expected that all of these bonds will be issued as general obligations of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. If however circumstances require, they may be issued by the appropriate authority. Bond retirement projections include the established schedules for bonds already issued and estimated schedules of maturity for future issues. ci AUDITOR GENERAL'S CERTIFICATE Pursuant to ARTICLE VIII, Sections 7(a)(4) and 7(c) of the CONSTITUTION OF PENNSYLVANIA To The Governor and The General Assembly: 1, GRACE M.
