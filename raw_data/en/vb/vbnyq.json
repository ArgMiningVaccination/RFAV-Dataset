Up until today, 14 drugs have been withdrawn from the market due to this deleteriou s side-effect ( Table 1 ). In 1997, a pivotal case report 2 triggered public awareness rega rding the risks associated with drug-induced arrhythmia. In this publicatio n, a 59 year-old man, who was otherwise healthy presented to the emergency depart ment after complaining of dizziness and shortness of breath whilst playing handba ll. When the patient's electrocardiogram was recorded, episodes of 'torsades de po intes' (TdP) were found to underlie his symptoms. The patient had been taking the antihistamine, terfenadine, the previous day for nasal congestion due to hay fever. Du ring clinical evaluation, the possibilities that the arrhythmia were caused by liver di sease, ischemia, myocardial infarction or electrolyte imbalances were ru led out, and it was considered likely that terfenadine, a drug available without prescription an d taken without concomitant other drugs, was the likely trigger for the arrhythmia. In early 1998, terfenadine was withdrawn from the market due to its potential to lead to TdP-type arrhythmias. Terfenadine was not the first marketed drug to be withdrawn due to cardiovascular safety concerns (see Table 1 ), but its story has become extremely important for drug development. It illustrated that compounds with even small risks of very serious side-effects, such as drug-induced TdP, could up set the risk-benefit balance of any new chemical entity. Recent wo rk has discussed the possibilities that terfenadine-induced dysrhyth mias may be due to its ability to cause ventricular fibrillation rather than TdP 3. Safety pharmacology studies play a signif icant role in guidin g the pharmaceutical industry in preventing unsafe agents, such as terfenadine, to reach the patient population. In addition, this di scipline is involved in prov iding valuable insights into the mechanisms of potential adverse effect s of drug candidates. Although the term 'safety pharmacology' was used prior to the inception of the ICH S7A document in 2001, where the core battery studies of safety pharmacology are described, it was in this document that the term was define d. These guidelines provide a basis for the preclinical safety studies, in three major areas (cardiovascular, respiratory and the central nervous system), that need to be performed before a new chemical entity can be tested in human studies. 10 INTRODUCTION Table 1 Drug Year of Introduction Therapeutic Area Year of Withdrawal Prenylamine 1960s Antianginal 1988 Lidoflazine # 1979 Astemizole 1986 Antihistamine 1999 Grepafloxacin 1997 Antibiotic 1999 Cisapride 1988 Gastric prokinetic 2000 Droperidol 1960s Tranquillizer / Analgesic 2001 Levacetylmethadol 1997 Methadone substitution 2001 Dofetilide # 1999 Class-III antiarrhythmic for fibrillation 1960s Clobutinol 1960s Antitussive 2007 Dextropropoxyphene ** 1960s Opioid analgesic 2009 * Re-introduced later following re -evaluation of risk-benefit; ** In addition to QT-liability, safety in overdose was also an issue. # Withdrawn by the sponsor for commercial reasons, European market. Table 1: Drugs withdrawn from the major markets of the world as a result of their potential for QT prolongation and/or TdP (Courtesy of Dr Rashmi R Shah 4). Drug attrition rates remain high, and this is one of the major reasons why the costs of drug development are astronomical. Th e major reasons for drug attrition are illustrated in Figure 1 as was initially shown in a study of Kola and Landis 5. Whilst efficacy of compounds at drug targets has increased over the years, as have pharmacokinetic and bioavailability issues, attr ition due to safety is actually becoming more of an issue. Therefore, a large unmet need clearly exists for the improvement of these safety issues at the early ph ases of the drug discovery process. 11 CHAPTER 1 Figure 1: Reasons for drug attrition in 1991 and 2000. PK, Pharmacokinetics. Modified from Kola and Landis, 2004. Over the 10-year period safety, both non-clinical toxicology and clinical, remain a major cause of drug attritio n accounting for approximately 30% of all drug discontinuation (Adapted from Laverty et al.; 2011) 6. From the three major areas that are studied under the auspices of the ICH S7A guidelines, cardiovascular risk, and particul arly arrhythmogenic risk, remains one of the major reasons for halting of preclini cal programs as well as withdrawal of compounds from the market. Figure 2 illustrates the prevalence and occurrence of safety liabilities relating to the major organ systems at all stages of the drug development process. Interestingly, th e only stage of this process where cardiovascular events are not the major cause of attrition is during phase 1, where healthy subjects are exposed to the new chemical entity. One of the major reasons for this could be the fact that card iac side-effects are more likely to show up in diseased hearts that have undergone remo delling, e.g., due to pressure or volume overload. Patients showing these characteristics are more likely to show up later on in the drug development process, and ultimately may be the desired target population. This underscore s the importance of screening compounds for cardiac side-effects in disease mo dels (see section 1.3). Figure 3 shows the major adverse events in the cardiovascular field that have been reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1969. Although the incidence of arrhythmia may be relatively high due to increa sed scrutiny of drug-induced arrhythmias over the last decade, these data illustrate the importance of arrhythmia as an unwanted cardiovascular side-effect. In addition, according to the data of Shah (2006) 7, QT prolongation was the reason for about on e-third of all drug withdrawals between 1990 and 2006. Despite the fact that prolongation of the QT interval in itself is not a safety issue, it is currently the most widely used risk marker for TdP arrhythmias. 12 INTRODUCTION Figure 2: Prevalence of safety liabilities relating to the major organ systems. At nearly all stages of drug development, ca rdiovascular liability causes the highest risk of safety issues (From Redfern et al.; 2010) 8. In 2005, the ICH introduced an additional gu ideline, ICH S7B, spec ifically addressing the issues of non-clinical evaluation of human pharmaceuticals on ventricular repolarization. In this guid eline various recommendation s were made, including an in-vitro screen to evaluate the effects of the compound on the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (I Kr) besides an in-vivo QT study. Later that same year, the clinical counterpart to ICH S7B, ICH E14, was also introduced. This guideline advocates the use of a thorough QT study in a randomized, double-blinded manner in healthy volunteers for all new chemical entities. 13 CHAPTER 1 Figure 3: Cumulative cardiac adverse events (AEs) reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) since 1969. Cardiac arrhythmias remain the most reported adverse effect in the cardiovascular field (From Laverty et al.; 2011) 5. The limitations of these guidelines are widely recognized. Among these, QT prolongation per se does not ne cessarily lead to arrhythmias 9, 10 (see section 1.3). Moreover, arrhythmia initiation is not a static process and ma ny factors interact, some of which remain unknown to date. With regard to the I Kr channel, when a compound blocks this channel, the sa me compound may not cause TdP in vivo. Thus, it is very likely that efficacious compounds are discarded early in the drug- development process due to inhibitory effects on I Kr, whereas simultaneous actions on other ion channels or proteins may offset the I Kr effects, rendering the compounds safe for in-vivo use. Alternatively, there are examples of compounds that may cause arrhythmias without having major effects on I Kr (e.g., JNJ303 11), and compounds that can increase repolarization duration while having minimal effects on IKr (e.g., alfusozin 12). As attrition rates and cardiac side-effects re main relatively high, there is a pressing need for better understanding of the mech anisms involved in TdP. Once these mechanisms are uncovered, this will allow fo r better prediction (via more predictive (surrogate) markers) and prevention (via novel targets) of this arrhythmia. 1.2 The Ventricular Action Potential and Arrhythmogenesis To understand the mechanisms of arrhythmog enesis, it is important to comprehend the complexity of the normal electrical acti vity of the heart and single cardiac cells. Each normal heart beat is init iated by an electrical impuls e that originates in special pacemaker cells in the sinus node. From here, electrical activity spreads via the atria and conduction system, ultimately activating the ventricular myocytes. 14 INTRODUCTION Activation of these cells leads to an ac tion potential configuration as shown in Figure 4. Since the first recordings of action potent ials in canine Purkinje fibres in the 1950's by Draper and Weidmann 13, we have come to understand the ionic basis of the cardiac action potential in grea t detail. The ventricula r action potential is made up of complex interactions betwee n both inward and outward ion movements across the membrane of myocytes causing bo th depolarization an d repolarization. In p h a s e 0 t h e r e i s a n i n w a r d m o v e m e n t o f s o d i u m i o n s ( I Na), which leads to rapid depolarization of the cell. During phase 1 rapid repolarization occurs via the transient outward potassium current (I TO). In some species, calciu m-activated chloride current (ICl(Ca)) also contributes. Following this, there is a tightly controlled balance of both inward and outward currents that determines the duration of the plateau phase of the action potential (phase 2). During this time period, the outward currents are carried by a number of potassium channe ls, including the rapi d and slow delayed rectifier currents (I Kr and I Ks, respectively) and the so dium-potassium pump (I NaK). Inward current is mainly carried th rough the L-type calcium channel (I CaL) and (depending on the membrane potential and local sodium and calcium concentrations) on the sodium-calcium exchanger (I NaCa). It is the entry of calcium during this time frame that causes activation of the ryanodine receptors and release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Th is process of calcium-induced calcium release is essential for excitation-contr action coupling and enables each action potential to be transduced into a mechanical event, allowing blood to be pumped around the body 14. Following on from the plateau phase, inacti vation of the calcium channels combined with increases in the outward potassium cu rrent lead to termin al repolarization (phase 3). Finally, outward potassium an d pump currents are responsible for the maintenance of the resting membrane potential (phase 4). As it can be seen from Figure 4 , there are species differences in the morphology of these action potentials. For example, I Ks i s m u c h l a r g e r i n g u i n e a p i g s w h e n compared to canine or human cells and I Cl(Ca) does not seem to play a role in phase-1 repolarization in human or guinea-pig cell s. However, the general principles remain the same for the three species shown. This is not the case in rat and mouse, where the action potentials are of very short duration due to the fact that the major repolarizing current is I TO. For this reason, it is not recommended that these species are used for the asse ssment of compounds on action-potential properties in safety-pharmacology studies. 15 CHAPTER 1 Figure 4: Representation of the inward and outward currents that contribute to the ventricular action potential in 3 different sp ecies. In addition, the cytoplasmic calcium transient is shown. Current amplitudes are relative to one another and were generated using 3 different computer models of the cardiac action potential 15 - 17. Phases 0-4 are noted for each action potential. (Court esy of Jordi Heijman, PhD). In addition to the species differences that are noted in Figure 4, there are also regional differences in the expression of the various ion channels throughout the heart, and this can contribute to different action-potential characteristics. In dog 18, human 19 and guinea-pig 20, the action potential of epicardial myocytes is shorter in duration than that of endocardial cells. In addition, the spike-and-dome configuration is more prominent in the epicardium than the endocardium. There is also regional heterogeneity in calcium-handling proteins 21 and recent work has demonstrated transmural heterogeneity of excitation-contr action coupling and calcium handling in human hearts 22. Various studies 23, 24have also illustrated that cells from the mid-myocardium have a longer action-potential du ration than those from the endocardium and are more susceptible to prolongation, e.g., by blockade of I Kr 25. However, the functional and cl inical relevance of these 'M cells' is still under debate 26, 27. Finally, there are also large interventricular differences in ion currents that contribute to dispersion of repolarization 28. These regional electrical gradients caused by the differences in action-potential duration are responsible for the T wave on the electrocardiogram 29, 30. Under various pathological conditions, exaggerated dispersion of repolarization creates the substrate for reentrant arrhythmias 31. 16 INTRODUCTION In 1998, the term \"repolarization re serve\" was introduced by Roden 32. According to this concept, the inhibition or functional impairment of one transmembrane ion channel does not automatically result in ex cessive repolarization changes due to the fact that other currents that are normally redundant can compensate for the current that is reduced. This \"reserve\" can be augmented by various factors, including sympathetic tone, diet (e.g. grapefruit juice 33) and disease (e.g. diabetes 34; see recent review by Varro et al. 35). In certain circumstances, however, the \"reserve\" is not sufficient to compensate for the challenge that is imposed upon it. Clinically, among conditions in which the repolariza tion reserve can be challenged are the congenital long-QT syndromes (LQTS), with a prevalence of around 1 in 2500 live births 36. In long-QT patients the duration of repolarization, as measured on the ECG as the time interval between the beginning of the Q wave and the end of the T wave, is prolonged. The two most common LQT syndromes are caused by mutations in the KCNQ1 gene (encoding for the -subunit of the I Ks channel) or in hERG (encoding for the -subunit of the I Kr channel), although at the time of this writing there have been 13 LQT syndromes described 37 - 39. Symptomatic patients with these syndromes can present with syncope or cardiac arrest, often as the result of TdP arrhythmia, and it is thought that the me chanisms of arrhythmogenesis in these patients are also operative in patients with drug-induced TdP. Afterdepolarizations are among the mechanis ms that are thought to be involved in arrhythmogenesis in both drug-i nduced 5 ). These oscillations can lead to either triggered activity 40 and/or functional block which may encourage re-entry circuits. These phenomena can be detected from the single cell to the tissue and can even be observed in the intact heart when monophasic action potentials are recorded 41. They are defined as depolarizations of the cardiac action potential that can occur in phase 2, 3 or 4 of the action potential 42. Normally if they occur in phase 4 they are called delaye d afterdepolarizations (DADs) and if they occur earlier on the action potential then they are termed early afterdepolarizations (EADs). There is now a general consensus that DADs are a result of a transient inward current (I TI) activated by intracellular Ca2+ 43. This transient inward current is mainly due to activation of the electrogenic Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), with the Ca2+-activated Cl- current (I Cl(Ca)) contributing in some species 44, 45. The mechanisms underlying EADs are much less clear cut however, and remain a topic of debate. Early evidence suggested EADs were caused as a result of reactivation of I CaL due to the prolonged plateau phase of the action potential 46, 47. However, there is other experimental evidence that suggests that EA Ds may also be caused as a result of I TI activation by intracellular Ca2+, especially under conditions of Ca2+ overload 48 - 50. 17 CHAPTER 1 Figure 5: Representative examples of afterdepolar izations occurring in the single canine myocyte.

In this particular example, blockade of I Ks DQG\u0003 -adrenergic stimulation are the proarrhythmic treatment and it can be seen that an early aftercontraction initiates prior to the upstroke of the EAD. 1.3 Proarrhythmic Models and Markers As TdP arrhythmias themselves are fortunately rare, strong surrogate markers are of crucial importance for the pharmaceutical in dustry for proarrhythmic risk assessment of novel chemical entities. In addition, various proarrhythmia models, both in-vivo and in-vitro, have been developed. These models share the characteristic of a reduced repolarization reserve, by different inciting mechanisms, which primes them for arrhythmia. In clinical reality, many patients with Td P do not have a 'perfect' unremodeled heart, which illustrates the importance of checking for proarrhythmic activity in disease models. The dog with chronic complete atriov entricular block (CAVB) is one such in-vivo model. It has been used for over a century 51and since 1995 52has received much attention as a model of TdP. After ablation of the atrioventricular node, electrical conduction from the atria to the ventricles is interrupted, resulting in a slower idioventricular rhythm to determine the heart rate. Due to this, cardiac output is initially reduced and over a period of 2-5 weeks ventri cular hypertrophy occurs as a compensatory mechanism 53. At the cellular level, the delayed rectifier K+ current IKs is reduced 54, whereas sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release and I NaCa are enhanced 55. Taken together, these alterations predispose to TdP arrhythmias, making the CAVB dog a sensitive model fo r TdP detection. Another in-vivo model used to detect the proarrhythmic potent ial of new compounds is the methoxamine- 18 INTRODUCTION sensitized rabbit 56. This model was first described in the early 1990s 57. Even today the exact mechanisms of -adrenoreceptor sensitization fo r TdP in this model are still unclear, however altered Ca2+ handling is likely to play a role. Over recent years, various newer animal PRGHOV\u0003KDYH\u0003EHHQ\u0003GHVFULEHG\u0011\u0003 -adrenergic UHFHSWRU\u0003 $5 stimulation with isoproterenol (ISO) reproducibly produced TdP in anesthetized dogs with a reduced repolarization reserve caused by selective I Ks blockade 58, 59. Interestingly under these conditions, aftercontractions were observed on the left-ventricular-pressure (LVP) signal prior to TdP induction, suggesting that abnormal Ca2+ handling plays a pivotal arrhythmogenic role. A combination of I Kr and I Ks b l o c k a d e h a s a l s o b e e n s h o w n t o i n d u c e T d P i n c o n s c i o u s d o g s a n d anaesthetized rabbits 60. Finally, in guinea pigs, adrena line has been used to reveal the torsadogenic potential of a combination of E-4031 (I Kr blocker) and HMR1556 (I Ks blocker) 61. In addition to the in-vivo models mentioned ab ove, there are also a number of in-vitro models, as reviewed by Lawrence et al. 62. Perhaps the most widely studied in-vitro model is the perfused and paced Langendorff-mounted rabbit heart. Many drugs with clinical proarrhythmic proper ties can be detected in this model 9, 63, 64. As already noted above, the most commonly used surrogate marker for TdP liability is the QT interval of the ECG. Althou gh this biomarker has been adopted by regulatory agencies, in both preclinical and clinic al studies, the link between a prolonged QT interval and arrhythmia is not watertight by any means. Numerous studies have indicated a discordance betw een QT prolongation and TdP induction. For example, Carlsson et al. 65 showed that QT prolongation alone could not discriminate between methoxamine-sensitized rabbits that showed TdP and those that did not. In this particular study, the I Kr blocker almokalant was infused at different rates. In the animals subjec ted to a high rate of infusion of the compound, TdP was seen in 9 out of 10 ra bbits and this was accompanied by an increase in QT of 30%. Intere stingly in the rabbits receiv ing a lower rate infusion, an increase in QT time of 42% was seen, however TdP was only seen in 1 out of 8 animals. In the clinical se tting, in patients with acqu ired prolongation of the QT interval, Gilmour et al. (1997) 66 showed that QT-interva l prolongation alone was insufficient to account for the initiation of TdP, suggesting that other arrhythmogenic factors are more relevant. O v e r r e c e n t y e a r s , m o r e d i r e c t m a r k e r s o f T d P p r e d i c t i o n h a v e b e e n p r o p o s e d . Among them are: TRIaD, beat-to-beat vari ability of repolarization (BVR) and the electromechanical window (EMW). 19 CHAPTER 1 In a study of Hondeghem et al. of 2001 9, the investigators characterized 702 chemical entities in Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, and then measured various determinants, collectively known as TRIad. Triangulation ('T') of the action potential (taken as the repolarization time from APD30 to APD90), reve rse-use dependence ('R'), temporal instability of action po tential duration ('I'), and dispersion of repolarization (spatial and temporal, 'D') were all measured. In these experiments, the instability was quantified by means of a so-called \"instability index\". This index was computed as the difference between the upper and lower quartiles of APD60 during the last 60 beats during drug perfus ion. However, this parameter does not take into account the consecutiveness of the beat-to-beat repolarization instability. Hondeghem and his colleagues then went on to plot the instability index against APD prolongation. In this setting, a number of chemical entities induced considerable repolarization instability wh ile producing only minimal le ngthening of the APD. TdP- like polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhy thmias were often seen under these conditions. Vice versa, there were al so compounds that lengthened the APD considerably but left temp oral instability minimally altered. These compounds showed no or hardly any arrhythmogenic activity. In addition to TRIaD, more recently Hondeghem also LQFOXGHG\u0003FDOFXODWLRQV\u0003RI\u0003FDU GLDF\u0003ZDYHOHQJWK\u0003 \u0003DV\u0003DQ\u0003 additional risk marker 67. Cardiac wavelength is the product of the effective refractory period and the conduction velocity and ther efore takes into account additional factors that appear to influence arrhythmogen ic outcome but otherwise would not be considered for arrhythmia risk. These data further question the utility of QT times alone as a proarrhythmic marker. Beat-to-beat variability of repolarization (BVR) takes into account the consecutiveness of variability. As dispersi o n o f r e p o l a r i z a t i o n s e e m s t o p l a y a n important role in arrhythmogenesis, it is likely that the consecutiveness of repolarization duration is al so vital. For example, if the repolarization duration increases by the same increment throughout the heart then it is unlikely that arrhythmia will ensue, as there is only a mi nimal risk of functional conduction block. In 2004, Thomsen et al. 10 quantified BVR as short-term variability (STV). This parameter was quantified as being the mean orthogonal distance from the line of identity to the most distant points of the Poincar\u00e9 plot. These data can be derived by XVLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003PDWKHPDWLFDO\u0003IRUPXOD\u0003679\u0003 \u0003_' n+1 - D n|/[n beats \u00a5\u0015@\u000f\u0003ZKHUH\u0003'\u0003UHSUHVHQWV\u0003 the duration of repolarization. This marker has been most extensively studied in the CAVB dog where D is derived from en docardial monophasic-action-potential recordings. In this model, multiple comp ounds have been test ed and BVR has been assessed 53. Interestingly, whereas BVR increases by the ad ministration of many proarrhythmic agents, it can also be re duced when an anti-arrhythmic agent is applied 68, 69. Since its inception, the concept of BVR has been applied in multiple animal models 58, 70 and also to the clinical situation 71 - 74 and, in the majority of conditions, it does seem to be a more reliable marker of arrhythmogenic risk compared to QT prolongation alone. 20 INTRODUCTION Finally, the latest surrogate marker to be described for TdP risk is the EMW, which was recently characterized in dogs by van der Linde et al. 59. Under normal conditions, the QT interval is shorter than the duration of the LVP (QLVP end), providing a positive EMW. Interestingly, atrial pacing, atropine or body temperature changes had no major effects on the EMW, whereas changes in the QT duration were considerable. However, during I Ks blockade in dogs, $5\u0003stimulation with ISO led to a large negative EMW and this was very often accompanied by TdP. Prevention of TdP by atenolol or verapamil was associated with a (much) less- negative EMW. On the other hand mexiletine, a class-1B antiarrhythmic drug sometimes used to treat LQT3 patients, did not affect the EMW or prevent TdP induction. These initial data indicate that mismatches between the electrical and mechanical activity of the heart may be better indicators of arrhythmogenesis than electrical activity alone. 1.4 Aims and Outline of this Thesis Based on the above, a greater understandin g of the underlying mechanisms behind drug-induced TdP is required, not in the leas t to aid the pharmaceutical industry to develop safer compounds and to avoid that efficacious compounds are discarded on false assumptions. Hence, the main object ive of the work presented in this thesis was to study the mechanisms involved in TdP arrhythmogenesis, focusing on the cellular aspects that underlie BVR, one of the newer surrogate markers thought to have utility in predicting this arrhythm ia. Particular attention was paid to how BVR is altered under various proarrhythmic conditions and how this can contribute to arrhythmia formation. In Chapter 2, we describe a protocol for isolating canine cardiac myocytes and then assessing changes in AP duration in cani ne ventricular myocytes utilizing optical imaging techniques. This technique is then validated by using various test compounds. In addition, a protocol is de scribed that allows for the assessment of BVR in single canine myocytes. The protocols described in Chapter 2 were then applied in the studies underlying Chapters 3 and 4. In Chapter 3, isolated myocytes were used to investigate the impor WDQFH\u0003RI\u0003$5 stimulation in the rescue of excessive increases in BVR following I Kr blockade and augmented late I Na. In addition, the effects of I Ks inhibition on BVR were investigated in the presence and abseQFH\u0003RI\u0003$5 stimulation. These studies were im portant in defining the influence that alterations in the repolarization reserve could have on BVR and enable us to begin to delineate ionic mechanisms of BVR. In Chapter 4 additional cellular mechanisms of BVR are descri bed. Here, we investigated the relationship between spontaneous Ca 2+ releases and BVR using a combined experimental and FRPSXWDWLRQDO\u0003DSSURDFK\u0003XQGHU\u0003FRQGLWLRQV\u0003RI\u0003$5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ\u000f\u0003ZLW K\u0003DQG\u0003ZLWKRXW\u0003, Ks blockade. In addition a mechanism for this relationship is prop osed. This chapter 21 CHAPTER 1 delves further into the ionic mechanisms of BVR and provides important insights into mechanisms behind TdP arrhythmias as well as aiding in the development of anti- arrhythmic agents. Chapter 5 investigates interventric ular differences in the regulation of cyclic AMP leve ls by phosphodiasterases (PDE), and how this can have differential effects on the ion channels that are regulated under this pathway, which may ultimately affect dispersion of re polarization and have arrhythmogenic consequences. In Chapter 6 we move from the single ce ll to the whole animal. In this study, the effect of a novel comb ined ion-channel blocker, AZD1305, was assessed for proarrhythmic liability in the CA VB dog, where repola rization reserve is already challenged by the remodeling process making these animals much more susceptible to TdP arrhythmia. In addition, BVR was monitored throughout these studies to further establish this parameter as a superior surrogate marker for TdP induction. In the studies for Chapter 7, we investigated the uti lity of the EMW in the anesthetized guinea-pig model after challenging these animals with known torsadogenic reference compounds. Finally, in Chapter 8 the findings of all chapters are discussed in an integrated manner an d ideas for further research are outlined. 22 INTRODUCTION References (1) Kerr WJ BW.

Because changes in cardiac action potential (AP) are undesirable, the evaluation of the effects of test compounds on the AP is essential before advancing ne w compounds to clinical testing. However, an increase in repolarization duration al one is not always proarrhythmic, and newer surrogate markers have been suggested to better predict the occurrence of arrhythmia. Described in this chapter is a protocol for assessing changes in AP duration in canine ventricular myocytes utilizing optical imaging techniques. This protocol can be used at an early stage of drug discovery due to its relatively fast throughput. Additionally, a protocol is presented for assessing the occurrence of after-depolarizations, as well as a nove l parameter risk, beat-to- beat variability of repolariza tion. This protocol can be used at a later stage of the drug discovery process to asse ss proarrhythmic potential. 32 ACTION POTENTIAL RECORDINGS IN CANINE VENTRICULAR MYOCYTES 2.1 Introduction Regulatory guidance documents 1, 2 rely on prolongation of the QT interval as a biomarker for predicting the risk of compou nd-induced Torsades de Pointes (TdP). As changes in cardiac action potential (AP) are undesirable, the evaluation of the effects of test compounds on the AP is essential before advancing new chemical entities (NCEs) to human testing. Compound throughp ut in the single myocyte assay is much greater than with conventional APD models , and animal use is reduced. However, the technical difficulties associated with making sharp-electrode (SE) recordings in these cells limit the number of test compounds that can be assessed. Hence, cell lines expressing key cardiac ion channe ls (IC), and the advent of automated electrophysiology, have made it possible to \"molecularise\" the AP as a means of early QT risk assessment. Nevertheless, no mat ter how comprehensive the panel of ICs becomes, there is always the need to assess test compounds in an integrated system (e.g., myocyte, whole animal). Accordingl y, a new method employing a fast voltage- sensitive dye (e.g., di-4-ANEPPS) to reco rd APs in left ventricular midmyocardial myocytes (LVMMs) and which is technically less challenging has been developed in our laboratories. Because of these attributes, it provides an experimental AP duration (APD) assay with high throughput, making it possible to more quickly identify and discard at an earlier stage of the drug di scovery process NCEs that may potentially modify APD 3. A prolonged QT interval cannot reliably pred ict the pro-arrhythmic potential of a test compound 4, 5. As a result, rather than simply assessing the QT interval prolongation risk, efforts are being made to identify more reliable preclinical proarrhythmic markers that correlate with the incidence of TdP, such as beat-to-beat variability repolarization as short-term variability (STV(APD)) in LVMM cells 4, 6, 7. Because one of the limitations to optical measurements from LVMM cells using di-4-ANEPPS is the need to limit measurements to finite time periods to avoid phototoxic effects of the dye, measurement of the putative proarrhythmic markers STV(APD), early after-depolarizations (EADs) and delayed after- depolarizations (DADs), could only occur usin g SE methodology. Therefore, the latter methodology can be used to assess the proarrhythmic potential of a test compound in LVMM cells at a late phase of the drug discovery process.

T h e focus is measurement of changes in the AP parameters induced by superfusion with a test compound (Basic Protocol) using di -4-ANEPPS. In addition, a protocol is described for investigating the arrhythmogenic effects of a test compound on temporal STV(APD) and the occurrence of EADs and DADs using the SE technique $OWHUQDWH\u00033URWRFRO\u0003\u0014 \u0011\u0003$V\u0003 -adrenergic receptor ( $5 stimulation is an important contributor to arrhythmogenesis under conditions where repo larization is impaired by a reduction in the slow ac tivated potassium current (I Ks), as occurs in association 33 CHAPTER 2 with either inherited or ac quired long QT1 syndrome 7, 8, a second alternate protocol is included that makes possib le an investigation of the e ffects of a test compound in combination with isoproterenol (ISO) \u000f\u0003D\u0003$5 agonist.

Figure 2: Optical experimental setup and tissue ba th. Epifluorescence recordings are made from LVMM cells as previously described (Hardy et al., 2009). The setup includes a Faraday cage ( A.), HSE stimulator P ( B.), waste bottle ( J.), inverted ( K.), long-pass filter superfusion tubing ( N.), connection to iris (xenon arc lamp, O.), narrow bandpass filters ( P, ( thermistor ( U.), chamber ( V.), oil objective ( W.), inflow ( X.), electrodes ( Y.), and heater ( Z.). 38. Using protocol A in Table 1 , apply continuous electrical field stimulation at 1Hz (i.e., 60 pulses/min) for 4 msec duration using a constant-voltage isolated MyoPacer field stimulator through bath-mounted platinum wire electrodes (FHD microscope chamber; Figure 2 ). Increase the stimulator voltage amplitude (generally 4-6 V) unt il some LVMMs begin to contract in time with the stimulus. Select a heal thy rod-shaped cell that has visible striations ( Figure 1F ), is not in contact with an y other cells, and contracts in time with the stimulus. Move this LVMM to the center of the microscope field of view. Use a diaphragm placed before the PMTs to limit the view around the cell and ensure that ligh t emitted from neighboring cells does not interfere 40 ACTION POTENTIAL RECORDINGS IN CANINE VENTRICULAR MYOCYTES with recordings. Close the rig doors. Determine the stimulation voltage ( 10- 20% above the minimum threshold) that will evoke a contra ction in the cell. Stimulation is controlled via protocols written in Clampex, the data acquisition module of pClamp. Protocol A allows for continued stimulation of LVMMs without exposure to excitation light (t o avoid di-4-ANEPPS phototoxicity) and with the PMTs gated (to maintain greate r stability). This ensures that a valid optical AP signal is evoked. 39. Once a valid optical AP signal has been obtained, use protocol B ( Table 1 ) to acquire an optical AP signal for 5 sec ev ery 4 min. In protocol B, continuous stimulation of LVMMs is maintained at 1 Hz, but the cells are exposed to excitation light and the PMTs are not gated (to allow for quantitative detection of the two differe nt emitted wavelengths). 40. Just before initiating superfusion wi th the test compound, record APs during exposure to the 0.1% DMSO vehicle solution. Use this AP as the control. 41. Initiate superfusion with each concen tration of test compound by opening the appropriate valve of the CF-8vs valve assembly using the cFlow controller. 42. If the test compound has an effect on the AP (e.g., prolongation or shortening), apply 0.1% DMSO to test the reversibility of the effect. 43. If the test compound has no effect on the AP, apply the reference compound to test whether the LVMM cell is capable of responding to an active compound. 44. Upon completion of the experiment, switch off perfusion and heater, disconnect suction, stop stimulation, and push the lever of the microscope away and remove the filter. 45. Clean all equipment between expe riments. Flush the FHD microscope chamber with ethanol followed by wate r and then dry thoroughly. Lower the objective, remove the glass cover, cl ean under the chamber with a tissue, and clean the objective with a lens cleaning tissue. Place sufficient drops of oil on the objective, place a new glass cover in the FHD microscope chamber, and then raise the lens so that a clear image can be seen through the oil via the eyepieces on the microscope when viewing any part of the FHD microscope chamber upon which LVMM cells may be placed. 46. Perform additional experiments to obtain data from at least four additional cells. 41 CHAPTER 2 Table 1 \"Step 44 protocol\" \"Step 45 protocol\" Digidata 1322A input/output Stimulus 5 V 5 V Di gital OUT 3 Shutter control 0 V 5 V Di gital OUT 2 PMT gating 5 V (which \"Gates\" the PMT) 0 V Digital OUT 1 560 nm PMT detection Yes Yes Analogue IN14 620 nm PMT detection Yes Yes Analogue IN15 Math signal No IN14 /IN15 Not applicable Table 1: Protocols used in Clampex 10 soft ware for detection of emitted light.

Using pClamp software, measure AP parameters ( Figure 3A ) from on-line acquired data and save the relevant information for additional off-line analysis. 48. Perform off-line analysis using Clampf it (a module of pClamp) and a custom- made optical AP myocyte macro 3 to smooth the optical trace data as follows: a. Calculate a baseline by taking the mean of the first 10 msec (100 data points). b. Subtract this value from all data points. c. Collect every tenth data point from the baseline data and smooth using cubic splines. d. Normalize smoothed and baseline data with respect to the maximum value of the AP \"dome\" peak. 49. Quantify test compound effects relative to data collected in the presence of the first perfusion with 0.1% DMSO. Data for each experimental condition are the average of five APs at 1 Hz, collected every 4 min. 50.

Fill a glass microelectrode with 3 M KCl using a 3-ml syringe and a 22-G spindle needle.

Move the markers of the video edge detection to the end of the cell to facilitate recording of the contractions. 18. After a 5- to 10-min stabilization peri od, decrease the pacing frequency to 0.5 Hz. Allow another stabilization period of 5 min, then increase the pacing frequency to 2 Hz. This will make it possible to determine any rate dependence of the test compound . 19. Just before initiating superfusion wi th the test compound, record APs during exposure to the 0.1% DMSO vehicle solution, and continue until a stable recording is obtained at each cycle length. Use these APs as the controls. 20. Initiate superfusion with each concen tration of the test compound and record APs at each of the three pacing frequencies. 21. If there is an effect of the test compound on the AP, apply 0.1% DMSO to test the reversibility of the effect after examining all concentrations of the test compound. 22. If the test compound has no effect on the AP, apply a reference compound to test whether the LVMM is capable of responding to an active compound. If the study is designed to assess the pote ntial of the test compound to prolong the QT interval, use dofetilide as the reference compound. 48 ACTION POTENTIAL RECORDINGS IN CANINE VENTRICULAR MYOCYTES Figure 6: Effects of test compound s on APs recorded from a canine LVMM using the SE technique.

If EADs are observed with the test compound, BVR should be assessed before the first one is noted. 30. Count the number of EADs or DADs that are seen in a 30-beat segment, and then calculate the percentage of beats showing these abnormalities. The number of EADs and DADs under the various conditions provides an additional proarrhythmic marker, as EADs have been sh own to play a role in arrhythmogenesis (FFigure 7). 2.4 Arrhythmogenic Effects of a Test Compound on Beat-To-Beat Variability of Repolarization Under Conditions that Mimic Long QT1 LQ\u0003WKH\u00033UHVHQFH\u0003RI\u0003 -Adrenergic Stimulation Described below is a procedure for assessing the arrhythmogenic effects of a test compound on the beat-to-beat variability of APs in LVMMs and occurrence of EADs DQG\u0003'$'V\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003SUHVHQFH\u0003RI\u0003$5 stimulation using ISO.

Both of these directives rely on prolongation of the QT interval as a biomarker to predict the risk that a test agent may produce TdP 12. As the distribution of ion channel proteins and ionic currents that determine AP shape an d duration are similar in both canine and human ventricles 13, the beagle dog is a commonly used preclinical specie s for testing the effects of compounds on cardiac repolarization 14. Additionally, as repolarization of LVMMs usually determines the end of the T-wave 5, data derived from these cells are thought to be good predictors of possible effects on the human QT interval. This unit describes a di-4-ANEPPS dye-based method (Basic Protocol) for assessing the effects of test compounds on the AP in canine LVMM cells that can be used to more efficiently generate APD data 3. This makes it possible to discard at an earlier stage in the drug discovery process those test agents that may affect the QT. Because scientists have sought to study the AP at the molecu lar level by implementing medium-throughput electrophysiological techniques (e.g., IonWorks 15- 17), and because the di-4-ANEPPS-based method can generate APD data more easily, this PHWKRG\u0003FDQ\u0003KHOS\u0003HVWDEOLVK\u0003DQ\u0003LRQ\u0003FKDQQHO\u00ed$3'\u0003SURILOH\u0003HDUOLHU\u0003LQ \u0003WKH\u0003GUXJ\u0003GLVFRYHU\\\u0003 process than has been possible in the past. In addition to APD assessment, the direct effects of test compounds on cardiac contractility and calcium transients can be detected in canine LVMM cells. Although significant advances have been made in developing in vitro tools to identify the functional effects associated with test compounds, in vitro screens for test compounds that are directly cytotoxic to the heart have not been established. Therefore, canine LVMM cells can also be used to develop in vitro 'black box' assays to predict cardiotoxicity at an earlier stage of a d r u g d i s c o v e r y p r o g r a m .

Hence, when assessing the properties of a test agent that may block the I Ks current, it is critical to exam ine its effects in the presence and absence of sympathetic stim ulation. Although the comp ound throughput of these alternate protocols is less than with the optical recordings, they provide critical information that cannot be gathered from optical or ion channel screening. For a number of years QT prolongation has been employed as a surrogate for tachyarrhythmia, TdP. However, it is now appreciated that QT prolongation per se does not predict the occurrence of this type of arrhythmia 6, 19, 20. Hence, there is a need for other markers for drug-induced a rrhythmias. Beat-to-beat variability of repolarization (BVR) has been prop osed as one such marker for TdP 6. Although the mechanisms responsible for increasing BVR are unknown, it appears they are generated, at least in part, in the cardiac myocyte. Moreover, cellular BVR has been shown to discriminate compounds that are proarrhythmic from those that may safely prolong repolarization 7, 21. The alternate protocols presented here allow for assessment of the effects of test compounds on this parameter as an indicator to how they may influence the temporal variability of repolarization in vivo. 2.5.2 Critical Parameters Preparation of LVMMs Careful preparation of LVMMs is the most critical step when measuring APs in isolated myocytes. Although the placement of the heart in ice-cold oxygenated calcium-free Tyrode's solution helps preserve it from injury, irreversible damage can be caused by taking too long to cannulate the LAD coronary artery and mount the heart before beginning perfusion of warmed , oxygenated normal Tyrode's solution without CaCl 2 (Figure 1 ). Additionally, although calcium-free normal Tyrode's solution containing collagenase A and BSA is perfused for 20 min through a beagle dog heart of \"normal\" size (80-120 g) to ac curately digest the perfused area of the left ventricular wall, the time of digestion must be tailored to the size of the heart if it is abnormally large or small. If the size of the heart is not carefully assessed after its removal, the cardiac tissue is likely to be under- or over-digested, yielding cells of lower quality for testing. 54 ACTION POTENTIAL RECORDINGS IN CANINE VENTRICULAR MYOCYTES Pacing frequency A crucial parameter is the pacing frequency applied to the cardiac myocytes, as described in Alternate Protocols 1 and 2. Many compounds that cause ventricular arrhythmias show reverse rate dependence. That is, they have a greater effect at s l o w e r p a c i n g f r e q u e n c i e s . T o t e s t f o r this, compounds are examined at multiple pacing frequencies. Caution must be exercised at every stage of recording to ensure that a steady state is attained. Initial pa cing of the cell under control conditions should last at least 5 to 10 min to allow fo r stabilization with th e microelectrode in place. After changing the pacing rate, at least 5 min should be allowed to achieve steady state. Choice of test compound concentrations At a relatively early stage of drug discov ery, the concentration range employed for testing a compound should be based on its effects on five key ventricular ion channels expressed in cell lines: hNav1.5 (mimicking the hI Na current), hCav1.2 (mimicking the hI CaL current), Kv4.3-hKChIP2.2 (mimicking the hI To current), hKv7.1- hKCNE1 (mimicking Ks current), and hKv11.1 (mimicking the hI Kr current). These values are obtained in preliminar y functional assessments using either conventional or automated electrophysiology. There needs to be consensus on how to use these data to understand APD/QT ri sk, particularly when a compound modifies a range of mutually compen satory electrophysiological processes, hence the requirement for assessment of a novel comp ound in an integrated AP system. Thus, there would be considerable value in being able to make full use of the early ion channel potencies with optical AP data that can be used to prioritize compounds early in the drug discovery process (Lead Identification and Lead Optimization) and before substantial resources have been invested. The mi croelectrode AP study can be used to assess the proa rrhythmic potential of one to two lead compounds before they are selected for preclinical development. Other considerations are the solubility of the test compound in the normal Tyrode's solution containing 1.8 mM CaCl 2 and the necessity of having the lowest test co ncentration approximate the predicted free Cmax in humans. The concentrations must be spaced at either half or full log 10 intervals to provide a high resolution concentration-effect curve in the event that effects are noted ( Figure 4 and Table 2 ). Troubleshooting Table 3 details some common problems encoun tered while obtainin g optical and SE measurements of cardiac APs in isolated LV MM cells. Possible causes and remedies are also discussed. 55 CHAPTER 2 Table 2 Compound NN (animals) Pacing Parameter Baseline Nominal concentrations VENTRICULAR MYOCYTES Compound NN (animals) Pacing compounds on STV(APD90) and triangulation (Ratio of APD90/APD50) as a function of change in APD90 in canine LVMMs. Data are expressed as mean\u00b1SEM.

APD data obtained with these nine compounds were as expected, except (1) D-sota lol-induced increases in duration were smaller than those caused by other class III antiarrhythmics, and (2) increases in APD were not detected usin g low concentrations of terfenadine.To investigate whether a test compound has a proarrhythmic potential, the procedure described in Alternate Protocol 1 should be employed. APD data obtained with dofetilide, D-sotalol, cisapride, terfenadine, pinacidil, and diltiazem were 2 ). Additionally, LVMMs exhibited a proarrhythmic response to I Kr blockers and ATX-II ( Table 2 and Figure 6 ). Incidence of EADs was not related to 59 CHAPTER 2 differences in AP prolongation, but corres ponded to BVR, quantified as STV (APD) (Table 2 and Figure 6. 7, 21). Moreover, assessment of changes in the AP shape (e.g., triangulation 19), in addition to changes in APD and STV (APD), may also be helpful for assessing the arrythmoge nic risk of a test compound ( Table 2 ). Blockade of the I Ks current with HMR1556 caused very little change in APD when compared to baseline conditions ( Figure 6 ), but predisposed the myocyte to increased BVR GXULQJ\u0003$5 stimulation, especially at fast rates and during the window of DAD occurrence ( Figure 7 ). DADs were generated in all cells and EADs in most cells (Figure 7 7). In summary, LVMMs provide a suitab le preclinical model to frontload the effects of new drugs on optically meas ured APD and also yield information about putative indicators of proarrhythmia (BVR , EADs, and DADs) that add value to an i n t e g r a t e d Q T / T d P r i s k a s s e s s m e n t b e f o r e a c o m p o u n d e n t e r s p r e c l i n i c a l development. 2.5.4 Time Considerations For the Basic Protocol, 30 min are needed to prepare LVMM cells ( Figure 1 ), followed by 1 hr of stabilization at room temperature in normal Tyrode's solution containing 1.8 mM CaCl 2. The stabilization period can be used to prepare the optical experimental setup and test co mpound solutions. Thereafter, 30 min are needed to load the cells with di-4-ANEPPS. Performing one experiment evaluating the effects of a test compound at four asce nding concentrations on the AP of an isolated LVMM cell requires 30 min. To conduct a study, an additional 2-3 hr are required for data acquisition and to take recordings from fo ur additional LVMM cells, and 10 min are needed for additional off-li ne analysis (including stat istics). Cleaning between experiments takes 5 min, with the loading of new cells beginning 10 min prior to the completion of the experiment in progress. If the LVMM does not respond to field stimulation, or if the recorded AP is no t valid for initiation of the experimental protocol, a new cell can immediately be selected from the FHD microscope chamber system ( Figure 2 , bottom left) without the need fo r a new stabilizat ion period. Some 20 min are needed at the end of the experi mental day to thoroughly clean the FHD microscope chamber system and superfusion tubing ( Figure 2 , top right and bottom left). To perform one of the experiments de tailed in Alternate Protocols 1 and 2, 30- 60 min are required after the myocytes have been isolated and stabilized, although obtaining a healthy cell with acceptable AP characteristic s can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. Around 10 mi n are needed at the end of the day for thorough cleaning of the perfusion system an d bath. In general, cells can be used for recording for up to 36 hr after isolation. 60 ACTION POTENTIAL RECORDINGS IN CANINE VENTRICULAR MYOCYTES References (1) Anon (2005a).

Cellular BVR and its dynamics before proarrhythmic events are poorly understood . We investigated di fferential responses of BVR in single myocytes during I Ks blockade versus were record ed from isolated canine left-ventricular midmyocytes at various pacing rates. I Ks was blocked by HMR1556, I Kr by dofetilide. Late I Na was augmented by sea anemone toxin-II. significan tly increased by I Kr blockade and late-I Na especially at VORZ\u0003SDFLQJ\u0003UDWHV\u0011\u0003$5 these BVR ch anges. In contrast, I Ks blockade caused very little change in repolarization when compared to baseline conditions, but predisposed the myocyte to iQFUHDVHG\u0003%95\u0003GXULQJ\u0003$5 stimulation, especially at fast rates. BAPTA-AM and SEA0400 reduced this excessive BVR and elim inated afterdepolarizations. In cRQFOXVLRQ\u000f\u0003$5 stimulation exaggerates BVR during I Ks blockade, indicating a BVR- stabilizing role of -adrenergic-sensitive I Ks. Loss of I Ks p l u s o v e r r i d i n g o f C a2+- dependent membrane current s, including inward Na+-Ca2+-exchange current, conspire to proarrhythmic BVR under these conditions. 66 IKS RESTRICTS REPOLARIZATION VARIABILITY ADRENERGIC STIMULATION 3.1 Introduction Beat-to-beat variability of ventricular repolarization du ration (BVR) occurs as an apparently random alteration of the re polarization duration (measured from transmembrane or monophasic action pote ntials (APs), local activation-recovery intervals or QT intervals) in consecutive heart beats at stable rates. Proarrhythmic conditions caused by I Kr blockade 1 - 3, I Kr-plus-I Ks blockade 3 and late-I Na augmentation 4 are characterized by significant in creases of BVR. When increased, BVR is a better predictor of drug-induc ed torsades de pointes (TdP) than repolarization prolongation alone, at least in canine and rabbit models 1 - 3, and in selected human patients 5. In the case of selective I Ks inhibition in vivo, BVR rema ins unchanged despite mild prolongation 3, upon the additi RQ\u0003RI\u0003LQWHQVH\u0003 -adrenergic receptor $5 \u0003 VWLPXODWLRQ\u0003 pronounced repolarization as evident from amplified BVR, and this preced es the triggering of early afterdepolarizations (EADs), ventricular TdP I K,ATP activation, steady-state ventricular pacing) that prevent TdP are characterized by stabilizat ion of BVR when often the QT interval is still prolonged 7. Collectively, these data indicate th at a prominent rise of BVR heralds torsadogenic instability of the heart, wh ereas its decline is an expression of restabilization of electrical activity. Cellular studies have revealed that the me chanisms underlying BVR reside, at least partly, in the cardiac myocyte. Under base line conditions at fixed-rate pacing, isolated ventricular myocytes express tempor al (i.e., beat-to-beat) variability of the action-potential duration (APD) 1, 8. A direct relationship exists between rate- dependent APD and BVR, even during random changes in pacing rate 9. Pharmacological interventions to influence ion channels that operate during the AP plateau can markedly alter baseline BVR. I Kr blockade 1, 8, 10 not only increases the cellular APD, but also BVR, whilst promoting the generation of EADs. Similar effects were noted for late-I Na augmentation with sea anemone toxin-II (ATX-II) 11. Conversely, the blockade of late-I Na with tetrodotoxin 8 or ranolazine 11, 12 largely suppresses these proarrhythm ic EGTA reduces BVR in myocytes 8. In contrast, little is known about the contribution of the potassium current I Ks to BVR stability in cardiac myocytes. I Ks function is prominent during $5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ when it promotes AP shortening by increased pr otein-kinase-A-dependent activation, and during I Kr block when it limits AP prolongation by time-dependent activation 10, 13, 14, thus providing critical \"repolarization rese rve\" when other repola rizing currents are impaired 15, 16. BVR exaggerates significantly when I Ks is inhibited after AP preprolongation with the I Kr blocker almokalant 10. 67 CHAPTER 3 In this study we investigated the properties of BVR in single canine left-ventricular (LV) myocytes during superfusion with standard buffer containing physiological concentrations of ions (baseline) and th e differential responses of BVR during selective I Ks blockade versus I Kr blockade and late-I Na augmentation, in the absence or presence o I\u0003$5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ .

Animal handling was in acco rdance with the European Directive for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes (86/609/EU). 3.2.1 Cell-Isolation Procedure Twenty three adult female beagle ighing 12.8\u00b10.3 kg (r ange: 10.5-15.0 kg; 9-31 months were used for the my ocyte isolations. Anesthesia was induced with 45 mg/kg pentobarbital. Once full anesthesia was reached, the chest was opened via a left thoracotomy and the heart was excised and placed in an O 2-gassed Ca2+-free standard buffer solution at approxim ately 4\u00b0C. The cell-isolation procedure was the same as previously described 17. Briefly, the left anterior descending coronary artery was cannulated and pe rfused. After ~20 min of subsequent the epicardial surface layer was UHPRYHG\u0003IURP\u0003WKH\u0003/9\u0003ZHGJH\u0003XQWLO\u0003 D\u0003GHSWK\u0003RI\u0003\u0095\u0016\u0003PP\u0003ZDV\u0003UHDFKHG\u0011\u00036 RIWHQHG\u0003WLVVXH\u0003 samples were collected from the mi dmyocardial layer underneath while contamination with the endocardium was av oided. Samples were gently agitated, filtered and washed. LV midmyocytes were stored at room temperature in standard buffer solution and only quie scent rod-shaped cells with clear cross-striations were used for the experiments. 3.2.2 Cellular Recordings Transmembrane APs were recorded at 37\u00b0C bath temperature using high-resistance (30-\u0019\u0013\u00030\u009f ) glass microelectrodes filled with 3 M KCl. Intracellular pacing was done at various cycle lengths (CLs) and only cells that showed a spike-and-dome AP morphology were accepted for the experime nts. Myocyte contractions were recorded with a video edge motion detector (Crescent Electronics, Sandy, UT, USA). 68 IKS RESTRICTS REPOLARIZATION VARIABILITY DURING ADRENERGIC STIMULATION 3.2.3 Solutions and Agents The standard buffer solution used for th e experiments was composed of (in mM): NaCl 145, KCl 4.0, CaCl 2 1.8, MgCl2 1.0, glucose 11 and I Ks. At 500 nM it blocks the current completely 10, while exerting minimal, if any, effects on IKr and other ion currents 6, 18, 19. IKr was selectively blocked by 1 M dofetilide (Apin Chemicals, Abingdon, Un ited Kingdom). Late I Na was augmented by 20 nM ATX-II (Sigma, Zwijndrecht, The Ne Netherlands). The Na+-Ca2+ exchanger was inhibited by 300 nM or 1 M SEA0400. At these concentrations SEA0400 has little effect on I CaL, the cytosolic Ca2+ transient or contraction of canine ventricular myocytes, whereas it blocks Na+-Ca2+ exchange by 28-80% (reverse mode > forward mode) depending on cytosolic Ca2+ concentration 20, 21.

This agent was originally dissolved in distilled water containing 30 M ascorbic acid and then stored in the dark at 4\u00b0C until use. 3.2.4 Data coefficien t of variability (CV) of APD90 as the percentage of standard deviation/mean APD90 8. Quantitative data are expressed as mean \u00b1SEM. Intergroup comparisons were made with Student's t test for unpaired and pa ired data groups, after testing for the normality of distribution. Differences were considered statistically significant if P<0.05. 3.3 Results 3.3.1 Baseline Characteristics of BVR in Canine LV Myocytes Figure 1A shows a histogram of 300 consecutive APD90s in a representative contracting myocyte during pacing at a CL of 1000 ms. APD90 was normally distributed about a mean of 276 ms with a SEM of 0.5 ms. Similar results were obtained from 13 cells. A correlation coe fficient of 0.90 was calculated between the histogram and a normal Gaussian fit. This indicated that APD90 variability within the 69 CHAPTER 3 canine myocyte occurs randomly, which is co nsistent with previous data from guinea pig 8. In 33 cells, pacing rate was varied between CLs of 350 and 4000 ms. APD90 increased on slowing of the pacing rate, as expected 22. Single representative and pooled APD90 data are shown in Figure 1B. BVR averaged 5.9\u00b10.5 ms at CL 1000 ms ( Figure 1B. ). Significant increases were calculated at both the fastest and slowest pacing rates; at CL 350 ms BVR was 10.3\u00b12.3 ms and at CL 4000 ms 11.3\u00b11.3 ms (both P<0. 05 vs CL 1000 ms). Similar patterns were found for CV. At CL 1000 ms CV averaged 2.6\u00b10. 2%, increasing to 4.7\u00b10.8% and 4.4\u00b10.5% at the same extreme rates (both P<0.05 vs. CL 1000 ms; Figure 1B ). Thus, at (very) fast pacing, rate-dependent adaptation of APD90 (further decrease) was clearly discordant with that of both BVR and CV (increases). Beat-to-beat alternans of both APD90 and contraction amplitude explained this discordance, as demonstrated in Figure 1C , left panel. APD90 alternans occurred as a very ordered process (interchanging between two values), whereas BVR was apparent as a more random APD90 be havior, generally at slower rates ( Figure 1C , right panel; same cell). This is furt her exemplified in the Poincar\u00e9 plots of Figure 1D . These data suggest distinct mechanisms for BVR and APD90 alternans. Both BVR and the APD90 in its formulation whereas CV does not, we used BVR in the remaining analyses. 70 IKS RESTRICTS REPOLARIZATION VARIABILITY DURING ADRENERGIC STIMULATION Figure 1: Baseline characteristics of BV R in canine LV myocytes.

CL, cycle Influences of Hyper- and Hypokalemia on BVR Next, we examined the influences of hyper- and hypokalemia. Representative results are shown in Figure 2.

Now, APD90 prolonged (+26%) and BVR increased to 9.0\u00b10.8 ms (P<0.05). No EADs were observed. Resting membra ne potentials varied with the [K+@O changes, as expected (see Figure 2A ). 71 CHAPTER 3 Figure 2: Response of APD and BVR to changes in [K+@O. A.

Poincar\u00e9 plots of APD90 of each of these traces are shown. An increase in BVR is seen during a state of hypokalemia, and a decrease in a state of hyperkalemia. 3.3.3 BVR Instability and EAD Generation during I Kr Blockade or late-I Na Augmentation, and R HVFXH\u0003E\\\u0003$5\u00036WLPXODWLRQ I Kr blockade with dofetilide (1 M) and late-I augmentation with ATX-II (20 nM) increased APD90 and BVR at pacing CL s of 500, 1000 and 2000 ms, but most significantly at the slower rate. This is shown in Figure 3 . In the case of dofetilide and for CL 1000 ms, BVR changed from 5.6\u00b10.5 ms at baseline 16.1\u00b12.9 ms (P<0.05; 19 cells; APD90 +37% from 297\u00b1 15 ms), as calculated from APD90s before the first occurrence of EADs (if present; see below). Similarly, in the case of ATX-II, BVR increased from 4.4\u00b10.5 ms normally distributed during both dofetilide and ATX-II (data not shown). 72 IKS RESTRICTS REPOLARIZATION VARIABILITY DURING ADRENERGIC STIMULATION Figure 3 : Increases in repola rization instability caused by both I Kr blockade and I Na augmentation DQG\u0003UHVFXH\u0003E\\\u0003$5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ .

During these drug challenges, th H\u0003 DGGLWLRQ\u0003 RI\u0003 $ R stimulation (ISO; 100 nM) drastically reduced APD90 and BVR at all cycle lengths, even to values below baseline ( Figure 3 ). EADs were also abolished. Fo r dofetilide at CL 1000 ms, BVR decreased from 16.1\u00b12.9 3.5\u00b10.7 (P<0.05; APD90 - 102% ms). For at the same CL, BVR was from to 2.8\u00b10.3 ms (P<0.05; APD90 -40% to 180\u00b110 ms). In some cells, delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) appeared during $5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ and drug challenge, however these did not reach the threshold fo r triggering APs. 3.3.4 BVR Instability and EAD G HQHUDWLRQ\u0003E\\\u0003$ R Stimulation during I Ks Blockade I Ks blockade with HMR1556 (500 nM) did no t affect APD90 at pacing CLs of 500, 1000 and 2000 ms, in line with previous results 10, 23. For example, at CL 1000 ms APD90 was 249\u00b18 ms at baseline compared to 250\u00b18 ms under HMR1556. Likewise, BVR remained unaltered at CLs of 500 and 1000 ms. However at CL 2000 ms, it increased moderately but significantly ( Figure 4 , bar graph; n=16). APD90 histograms remained normally distributed during HMR1556. No EADs or DADs were observed during HMR1556 only. 73 CHAPTER 3 Figure 4: $R stimulation unmasks repolariza tion instability caused by I Ks blockade.

DADs were generated in all cells (n=10), and EADs in most of them. At pacing CL 100 0 ms, BVR increased to 5.7\u00b10.3 ms during HMR1556 plus ISO before the occurrence of DADs from a value of 4.2\u00b10.2 under HMR1556 alone. During the subsequent phase with DADs, BVR increased further to 14.8\u00b11.5 ms (P<0.05). APD90 also showed a significant increase at all CLs. For example at CL 1000 ms, APD 90 averaged 291\u00b115 ms (+17% versus baseline) during HMR1556 plus ISO in the phase with DADs. Obviously, EADs exaggerated BVR and APD90 even further ( Figure 5 ). BVR and APD90 changes, and the generation of DADs and EADs, were completely reversible upon washout of ISO. 3.3.5 Differential Magnitudes of BVR in Cells with or without EAD Generation, and Rate Dependence of EADs under Different Conditions During I Kr blockade and late-I Na augmentation, BVR increases (most pronounced at slow rates) were significantly larger in myocytes in which EADs ensued, even though BVR was calculated before the first EAD occurred, (n=8/19 for dofetilide and n=5/12 for ATX-II) versus those cells in which no EADs were seen (n=11/19 and n=7/12, respectively). This is shown in Figure 6A (for CL 2000 ms). In contrast, EADs generated during I Ks EORFNDGH\u0003SOXV\u0003$ R stimulation were clearly fast-rate dependent ( Figure 6B ). Under these conditions, BVR was not statistically different were always preceded by DADs and were always accompanied by early aftercontractions (Figure 7 and Figure 8 , middle panels). 74 IKS RESTRICTS REPOLARIZATION VARIABILITY DURING ADRENERGIC STIMULATION Figure 5: Time course of increased repo larization instability during I Ks EORFNDGH\u0003SOXV\u0003$ R stimulation.

Early aftercontractions usually took off before EAD upstrokes ( Figure 7 , middle panel) and, in fact, occurred often without concrete EADs. Collectively, these data indicated that EADs and DADs during I Ks EORFNDGH\u0003 SOXV\u0003 $ R stimulation are generated as the consequence of cellular Ca2+ overload and spontaneous Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulu m, and they suggested a mechanistic contribution of inward Na+-Ca2+ exchange 24, 25. 76 IKS RESTRICTS REPOLARIZATION VARIABILITY DURING ADRENERGIC STIMULATION Figure 7: excessive BVR during I Ks SOXV\u0003 $ R stimulation.

Data were obtained in 6 cells. As shown in Figure 7 , BAPTA-AM signif icantly reduced excessive BVR and eliminated all EADs (a n d D A D s ) . A t p a c i n g C L 1 0 0 0 m s , B V R changed from 12.9\u00b11.6 ms during HMR1556 plus ISO (before first EADs) to 4.2\u00b10.1 ms (P<0.05) during additional BAPTA-AM, even despite extra AP prolongation (APD90 +56%). The latter is likely caused by a reduction in I CaL inactivation 26 and an IKr-blocking side-effect of BAPTA-AM 27. BVR restabilization was maximal when all (after) contractile activity was inhibited by the Ca2+ buffer. 77 CHAPTER 3 Figure 8 : Na+-Ca2+ exchange inhibitor SEA0400 resc ues from excessive BVR during I Ks plus $5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ .

Figure 8 illustrates the effects of SEA0400 (300 nM) at CL 500 ms. BVR decreased significantly from 12.2\u00b11. 5 ms during HMR1556 plus $5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ to 2.4\u00b10.2 ms (P<0.05) during additional SEA0400. Effects were less pronounced at CLs 1000 and 2000 ms. All EADs were eliminated upon th e addition of SEA0400. BVR effects were quantitatively similar for 300 nM and 1 M SEA0400, as were reductions of APD90 and contraction amplitude. At CL 500 ms, APD90 decreased from 246\u00b116 ms during HMR1556 plus $5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ to 201\u00b113 ms (P<0.05) during additional SEA0400, whilst contraction amplitudes were decreased by 52\u00b15%. 3.4 Discussion The mechanisms underlying BVR at the single-cell level are poorly understood. In the present study, we used canine ventricular myocytes to investigate BVR responses at baseline and during variou s proarrhythmic challenges. Our data indicate that I Ks stabilizes BVR at slow pacing rates under ba seline conditions, despite the absence of changes in APD90. $5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ of I Ks rescues from excessive repolarization instability and EAD generation during I Kr block and late-I Na augmentation. Furthermore, our results support the notion that $5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ during drug- induced I Ks block promotes altered Ca2+ handling and enhanced activation of Ca2+- dependent membrane currents, including inward Na+-Ca2+ exchange, thus 78 IKS RESTRICTS REPOLARIZATION VARIABILITY DURING ADRENERGIC STIMULATION exaggerating BVR. Although single myocyte is not the sole contributor to in-vivo QT variability, our novel insights are cr ucial for the understanding of BVR at the whole organ level such as seen after I Ks blockade and $5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ 6. 3.4.1 Distinction between BVR and Repolarization Alternans At baseline, BVR is mainly de pendent on APD which in turn is reliant on cycle length. A t v e r y f a s t r a t e s , h o w e v e r , A P D 9 0 a n d B V R b e c o m e d i s c o r d a n t a s t h e r e s u l t o f beat-to-beat repolarization alternans ( Figure 1 ). The latter is an ordered process, characterized by interchanging between two APDs and concomitant contraction amplitudes. Although repolarization altern ans is considered arrhythmogenic, EADs are not normally seen under these condit ions, at least not in our experiments. Repolarization and contraction alternans arise from beat-to-beat alteration in cellular Ca 2+ cycling 28. BVR, on the other hand, is charac terized by an apparently random behavior of APD, generally at intermediate and slow rates. Even during pronounced BVR instability, e.g., by hypokalemia, I Kr blockade and late-I Na augmentation, contraction amplitudes remain relatively stable (contraction data not shown). Our data thus indicate that in the majority of cases BVR and APD90 show parallel c h a n g e s . H o w e v e r , i n s p e c i f i c c o n d i t i o n s t h e y c a n d e v i a t e , f o r e x a m p l e d u r i n g I Ks blockade plus $5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ , and during I Ks blockade plus $5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ and BAPTA-AM. This suggests that BVR is not necessarily dependent on APD90 at all times, which has major mechanistic implications. Cellular BVR likely results from the stoc hastic activities of transmembrane ion transporters, including ion channels, during the AP plateau phase. During this phase, around the 0 mV level, the memb rane resistance is very high 8, meaning that minute changes of the ion fluxes across the membrane can significantly affect the membrane potential which in turn will alter the re polarization duration 29. Interventions that reduce net outward current will cause a prolongation of this vulnerable phase, meaning that there is an extended period at which the voltage is around the 0 mV level. Stochastic behavior of the ion channels may then increase B V R . I t i s a l s o p o s s i b l e t h a t t h i s s t o c hastic behavior resu lts indirectly from subsarcolemmal Ca 2+ f l u c t u a t i o n s t h a t l e a d t o m o d i f i c a t i o n o f C a2+-dependent ion currents. Modeling data has shown that during ISO stochastic I CaL gating in mode 2 results in APD variability as well as EAD generation 30, and this could contribute to the BVR seen in this study. 3.4.2 Cellular BVR during $5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ In the present study, we have shown that BVR is drastically increased under conditions of I Kr blockade or late I Na augmentation in isolated canine LV midmyocytes. The addition of $5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ , however, causes a major reduction in BVR and eliminates EAD activity ( Figure 3 ). As I Ks LV\u0003WKH\u0003PDLQ\u0003$ -sensitive outward current in the canine ventricular AP, this current appears responsible for the 79 CHAPTER 3 restabilization of repo larization. If true, $5\u0003 VWLPXODWLRQ would provoke BVR instability during I Ks blockade, as I Ks could no longer compensate for the increased ICaL caused by $5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ , which leads to increased cellular Ca2+ load and APD90. This was indeed the case: BVR increased significantly, despite only moderate increases in APD90 ( Figure 4 ). In this phase, $5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ\u0003 also evoked DADs and EADs ( Figure 5 ). BVR increased after the firs t generation of DADs (even before EADs occurred; Figure 5 ), which supports the concept that dynamic subsarcolemmal Ca2+ fluxes during cellular Ca2+ overload and diastolic spontaneous Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulu m influence the subsequent (paced) APs and BVR via mechanisms yet to be eluc idated. Our finding that BVR and EAD generation by I Ks blockade and $5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ\u0003 were most pronounced at fast pacing rates (as opposed to I Kr blockade and late-I Na augmentation; Figure 6 ) fits with this concept. Additional support comes fr om the result that intracellular Ca2+ chelation with beat-to-be at repolarization instability ( Figure 7 ). Moreover, in preliminary experiments in which we used ryanodine (1 M) during I Ks blockade DQG\u0003$5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ (data not shown), blockade of sarcoplasmic-reticulum Ca2+ release reduced excessive BVR (while inhibiting the generation of afterdepolarizations), again supporting that calcium-dependent membrane currents contribute to BVR. Our results on afterdepolarization occurren ce are partially in agreement with data from the canine LV-wedge preparation 31. Burashnikov and Antzelevitch 31 reported that under combined I epi-, mid- and endocardium. Transmural dispersion of repolarization was accentuated. However, no EAD activity was seen. This apparent discrepancy with our observations in isolated myocytes could be explained by the difference in cell-to-cell electrotonic coupling. The latter, which acts in the LV wedge preparation but not in the isolated cell, has been shown to reduce BVR 8. 3.4.3 The Na +-Ca2+ Exchange EADs during I Ks Blockade plus $5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ Various groups have used the Na +-Ca2+-exchange inhibitor SEA0400 in attempts to prevent TdP under conditions of I Kr block 32, 33 and I Na augmentation 32 with mixed results. Milberg et al. 32 showed that the application of SEA0400 (1 M) in the presence of sotalol or veratridine resulted in a significant decrease of monophasic APD and an attenuation of EADs in paced La ngendorff-perfused rabbit hearts with complete atrioventricular block, supporting the hypothesis that the Na +-Ca2+ exchanger is an important mediator of EADs 25. However in the study of Farkas et al. 33 SEA0400 (1 M) did not suppress TdP nor decrease QT variability in unpaced Langendorff-pe rfused rabbit hearts with complete atrioventricular block. The major difference between these two studies was that in the study of Milberg 33 hearts were paced at constant cycle lengths, whereas in the alternate study 32 hearts were allowed to beat at th eir intrinsic ventricular rate. Upon 80 IKS RESTRICTS REPOLARIZATION VARIABILITY DURING ADRENERGIC STIMULATION administering SEA0400 in addition to dofeti lide, the rate instability increased, and this additional factor could have increased the susceptibility to TdP, at variance with the results of Milberg et al. 33. To the best of our knowledge this report is the first to describe the use of Na+-Ca2+- exchange inhibition in the presence of I Ks block combined with $5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ\u0003 (as such mimicking long-QT syndrome type 1 ( L Q T 1 ) ) . I n l i n e w i t h M i l b e r g 33, the application of SEA0400 resulted in a sign ificant decrease of transmembrane APD and an attenuation of EADs ( Figure 8 ). Moreover, from BVR, suggesting a repolarization-des tabilizing role of inward Na+-Ca2+-exchange under of IKs blockade combined with $5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ 24. 3.4.4 Clinical Perspectives In LQT1 patients, sympathetic stimulatio n and epinephrine challenges prolong the QT interval 34, increase beat-to-beat QT variability 35 and promote EAD generation 34. Our present cellular results may thus have important clinical implications, as they support the use of Ca2+ antagonists 36\u000f\u0003$R blockers 34, 36 and even I K,ATP openers 34 to restrain BVR and reduce the risk of TdP in these patients. Indeed, $5\u0003blockade, the cornerstone of pharmacological treatment in LQT1, Likewise, -adrenergic-receptor blockade with ph enylephrine can decrease transmural d i s p e r s i o n o f r e p o l a r i z a t i o n i n L Q T 1 p a t i e n t s , b u t c a u s e s i t t o i n c r e a s e i n L Q T 2 patients 37. Whether the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is a suitable target for antiarrhythmic treatment in LQT1 patients is currently under debate. 3.4.5 Conclusions The repolarizing potassium current I Ks stabilizes BVR in sing le canine LV myocytes. During conditions of I Kr blockade and late-I Na DXJPHQWDWLRQ\u000f\u0003$5\u0003VWL mulation of I Ks rescues from excessive BVR, AP prolongation and EAD generation. However, during I Ks blockade $5\u0003 VWLPXODWLRQ\u0003 provokes excessive BVR, while promoting the generation of DADs and EADs. The loss of I Ks plus overriding of Ca2+-dependent inward currents, including inward Na+-Ca2+-exchange current, likely conspire to cellular proarrhythmia under these conditions. 3.5 Acknowledgements The authors wish to thank Dr. Heinz G\u00f6 gelein, Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany for Andr\u00e1s University of Szeged, L.H.M.G.

Previous research has shown that BVR is increased d XULQJ\u0003LQWHQVH\u0003$5 stimulation leading to SCR. We aimed to determine ionic mechanisms controlling BVR unde r these conditions. Membrane potentials and cell shortening or Ca2+ transients were recorded from isolated canine left-ventricular myocytes in the presence of isoproterenol. Action-potential (AP) durations foll owing DADs were significantl y prolonged. Addition of I Ks blockade led to further AP prolongation af ter SCR and this strongly correlated with exaggerated inhi or using Mg2+ or flecainide, eliminated DADs and decreased BVR independent of effects on AP duration. Computational analyses and voltage-clamp experiments measuring I CaL with and without prior SCR indicated that I CaL was increased during Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release after SCR, and this contributes to AP prolongation. Prolon gation of QT, T peak-Tend intervals and left-ventricular monophasic AP duration of beats followin g aftercontractions occurred pr ior to torsades de pointes in an in-vivo dog model of dr ug-induced long -QT1 syndrome. SCR contributes to increased BVR by interspe rsed prolongation of AP duration, which is exacerbated during I Ks blockade. Attenuation of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release by SCR underlies AP prolongation via increased I CaL. These data provide novel insights into arrhythmogeni F\u0003PHFKDQLVPV\u0003GXULQJ\u0003$5\u0003 stimulation besides triggered activity and illustrate the importance of I Ks function in preventing excessive BVR. 88 SPONTANEOUS CALCIUM RELEASE AND REPOLIZATION 4.1 the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), larger Ca2+ transients (CaT), and enhanced contractile force 1. Under certain conditions Ca2+ load is increased beyond a certai n threshold, leading to spontaneous Ca2+ release (SCR) from the SR during diastole 2. In turn, this diastolic leak causes a transient inward current (I TI), causing delayed afterdepol arizations (DADs), mainly due to activation of the electrogenic exchanger (NCX), with the Ca2+-activated Cl- current (I Cl(Ca)) contributing in some species 3, 4. Previous work has shown that both DADs and early afterdep olarizations (EADs) may share a common mechanism, DW\u0003OHDVW\u0003GXULQJ\u0003$5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ\u0003DQG\u0003&D2+ overload, namely SCR-induced currents 5. Both types of afterdepolarizations ha ve been incriminated in the formation of ventricular tachycardia (VT), via trigge red activity (TA) and/or by increasing dispersion of repolarization 6. Beat-to-beat variability of repolarization duration (BVR ) occurs as an apparently random alteration in repolari zation duration, and can be observed at all levels, from the action potential (AP) of the single cardiac myocyte to the QT interval on the body surface 7 - 9. Exaggerated BVR has been reported to be a more reliable indicator of arrhythmogenic risk than re polarization prolongation pe r se, at least in several experimental VT models 10 - 12 and in selected human subjects 8, 13. Although BVR has been invest igated in multiple studies, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon at the single-cell le vel remain to be fully elucidated. Pharmacological interventions influencing ion channels that operate during the AP plateau can markedly alter BVR 7, 14. Despite the fact that inhibition of the slowly- activating dela yed-rectifier K+ current (I Ks) alone has minimal effects on both cellular AP duration (APD) and BVR 14, we have recently shown that during increased Ca2+ loading in myocytes subjected to blockade of I Ks LQ\u0003FRPELQDWLRQ\u0003ZLWK\u0003$5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ\u000f\u0003 BVR is significantly enhanced, even before the occurrence of EADs and TA 14.

Ph armacological interventions that inhibit SCR (either with reduced or preserved systolic contraction) prevent this SCR- associated AP prolongation and reduce BVR. 89 CHAPTER 4 4.2 Methods This investigation conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US Na tional Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996). Animal handling was in acco rdance with the European Directive for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes (86/609/EU). 4.2.1 Myocyte Isolation and Electrophysiology Canine left ventricular myocytes were isolated as previously described 15. Transmembrane APs were recorded at ~37\u00b0C using high-resistance microelectrodes filled with 3 mol/L KCl. Myocyte contractions were recorded with a video edge motion detector. 4.2.2 Calcium Measurement We used the perforated patch-clamp tech nique under current- or voltage-clamp control as previously described 16. Myocytes were stimulated to elicit APs (current clamp) or I CaL (voltage clamp). Change s in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+@i) were measured using Fluo-3 or Fura-2 AM 16. 4.2.3 Computational Analysis A recent model of the canine ventricular P\\RF\\WH\u0003HOHFWURSK\\VLRORJ\\\u0003LQFOXGLQJ\u0003$5\u0003 stimulation 17 was extended with a method to induce diastolic SR Ca2+ release in one of two identical Ca2+ domains in a controlled fashion ( Figures 1 and 2). Simulations were performed in single cells as well as a one-dimensional homogeneous strand or two-dimensional tissue of electrically-coupled cells to determine the effects of diastolic Ca2+ release in the presence of electrotonic coupling. 90 SPONTANEOUS CALCIUM RELEASE AND REPOLIZATION Figure 1: Schematic overview of the computational model of the canine ventricular myocyte. Adapted from Heijman et al. 17. The model was divided into two identical domains to simulate the local origin of SCR. Only components on the left side of the model are labeled for clarity, identical components are located on the right side. The domains are coupled via diffusion of Ca2+ (Idiff,cyt and I diff,nsr). All other abbreviations ar e as previously described 17. Similar simulations were performed in a one-dimensional homogeneous strand of electrically-coupled cells to dete rmine Ca2+release in the presence electrotonic coupling. 4.2.4 In-Vivo of Drug-Induced Long-QT1 Syndrome Torsades de Pointes (TdP) arrhythmias we re induced in an in-vivo dog model of long-QT1 (LQT1) syndrome, as previously described. 11 ECG, left ventricular pressure (LVP) and left ventricular monophasic acti on potentials (LV MAPs) were recorded throughout the experiments and analyzed offline. 91 CHAPTER 4 Figure 2: Validation of model properties.

DADs were detected with a semi-automated method using a custom software script. Wher e applicable, data were reported as mean\u00b1SEM of n experiments, and significance tested with either a t-test or one-way ANOVA. Differences were considered statis tically significant if P<0.05. 92 SPONTANEOUS CALCIUM RELEASE AND REPOLIZATION 4.3 Results 4.3.1 DADs Prolong Subsequent APs and Increase BVR Under baseline conditions, a small beat-t o-beat APD variability was observed ( Figure 3A; \u0011\u0003$5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ\u0003ZLWK\u0003LVRSURWHUHQRO\u0003 ,62 enhanced contraction ( Figure 3A; middle panel ) . I n t h e m a j o r i t y o f c e l l s , 1 0 0 nmol/L ISO caused DADs during pacing at 1000 ms CL. APs following a DAD were prolonged, leading to increased BVR due to interspersed occurrence of normal and prolonged APs ( Figure 3A; middle panel ). Pharmacological inhibition of I Ks by HMR1556 (500 nmol/L) in the presence of ISO further prolonged APD and increased BVR ( Figure 3A; right panel ). In separate experiments, Ca2+ transients were recorded together with APs after HMR1556 and ISO. HMR1556 alone did not increase the Ca2+-transient amplitude nor lead to any SCR events. The combination of HMR1556 and ISO, however, led to large increases in Ca2+ amplitude and SCR, as expected.18 APs following SCR were prolonged and had a reduced systolic Ca2+- transient amplitude compared to those where no diastolic release preceded the AP, indicating reduced SR Ca 2+ load at the start of the AP ( Figure 3B ), consistent with the reduced cell shortening fo llowing an aftercontraction ( Figure 3A ). APD prolongation following a DAD was signif icantly more pronounced in the presence of ISO + HMR1556 compared to ISO alone at all CLs (e.g., 41\u00b16 ms vs. 15\u00b14 ms at CL = 1000 ms, P<0.05, Figure 4A ) and this coincided with a significant increase in (17\u00b12 ms vs. 7\u00b11 ms; P<0.05, Figure 4B ). As such, HMR1556 was added in all s u b s e q u e n t e x p e r i m e n t s i n t h e p r e s e n c e o f I S O t o m a x i m i z e e f f e c t s o n A P D , essentially creating a cellular mode l of drug-induced LQT1 syndrome 14. DADs showed typical rate-dependent properti es, including increased amplitude and decreased AP-DAD coupling interval at shor ter pacing CL, consistent with previous results 19. IKs blockade did not alter rate-dependent DAD properties ( Figure 5 ). 93 CHAPTER 4 Figure 3: Occurrence of DADs in canine ventricular myocytes is associated with prolongation of subsequent APs and increased BVR. A. APD 90 for 75 consecutive beats at 2000-ms CL at baseline (left panel: I), during wash-in of ISO (middle panel: II) and in the presence of HMR1556 and ISO (right panel: III).

Beats without prior SCR are indicated in black, beats with prior SCR in grey. B. Membrane potential (top) and [Ca 2+@i for four consecutive beats. APD 90s are indicated below each AP. SCR is indicated with arrows . To determine whether DAD-like membrane-p otential changes alone (i.e., without underlying alteration s in intracellular Ca2+) influenced the subsequent AP, current was injected to induce smal l alterations in the resting membrane potential (25-mV amplitude, 150-ms duration; Figure 4C ; top panel ). There was no significant difference between APDs in the absence or presence of these diastolic pulses (Figure 4D ), independent of the timing of the pulse (not shown). In contrast, when these cells were stimulated with HMR1556 + ISO, DADs occurred and subsequent APD was significantly prolonged ( Figure 4C; bottom panel ), indicating that alterations in the subsequent APD were infl uenced by DAD-related events other than membrane-potential alterations per se. 94 SPONTANEOUS CALCIUM RELEASE AND REPOLIZATION Figure 4: A .

EADs occurred predominantly at 500-ms CL and exclusively in the presence of HMR1556 + ISO. Figure 6: Relationship between di astolic SCR and EADs. A.Top panel: Cell shortening (top trace) and membrane potential (bottom trace) fo r 5 consecutive APs followed by an AP with EAD (indicated with *) in a representative ce ll at 500-ms CL in the presence of HMR1556 + ISO.

A similar contraction pattern can be obse rved but APD prolongation is insufficient to promote EAD formation. C. Time differences between rise of aftercontraction and EAD, indicating that aftercontractions occur earlier than EADs. We observed early aftercontractions preceding EAD upstrokes by 21\u00b15 ms ( Figure 6 A, C and 5), consistent with the observations by Zhao et al. in rabbit ventricular myocytes challenged with ISO and the I CaL agonist Bay K 8644,20 suggesting a role of SCR for EAD formation under these specific conditions 5. 97 CHAPTER 4 We quantified the occurrence of DADs in the beats preceding an EAD and found that DADs were significantly more likely to o ccur in the 2 beats directly preceding an EAD (53% and 95% of APs) compared to av erage DAD occurrence for all beats (34%; Figure 6A bottom panel ). Figure 6B shows the responses during ISO alone. 4.3.3 Blockade of (Spontaneous) SR Ca 2+ Release Reduces BVR We sought to further investigate how el iminating SCR would affect APD and BVR. Blockade of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) wi th ryanodine eliminated DADs and led to a drastic reduction in BVR, despit e leading to an increased APD ( Figure 7A, B ). APD prolongation under these conditions was not associated with any arrhythmogenic events. A drastic reduction in systolic contraction was also seen, as expected, indicating that blockade of RyRs was achieved effectively. Tetracaine reduces the open probability (P o) of RyR leading to a decrease in the frequency of SCR in unstimulated rat ventricular myocytes 21 and the ISO-induced SCR in ed rat ventricular myocytes 22. Similar to ryanodine, tetracaine led to an elimination of DADs in our experiments, and a reduction in BVR at all CLs. Howe ver, unlike ryanodine, cell shortening remained largely unaltered, indicating that systolic Ca2+ release was largely intact (Figure 7C, D ). 98 SPONTANEOUS CALCIUM RELEASE AND REPOLIZATION Figure Inhibition of (diastolic) SCR abolishes DADs and reduces BVR.

Ryanodine and tetracaine abolish DADs and reduce BVR. To determine the effects of increasing the P o of RyRs, as opposed to decreasing it, we used low concentrations of caffeine (maximally 500 mol/L) 23.Under these conditions the percentage of APs show ing DADs was increased at all CLs. Interestingly, this led to a significant decrease in BVR compared to HMR1556 and ISO alone, since DADs occurred before every AP ( Figure 8 , right-most grey bars). 99 CHAPTER 4 Figure 8: Interventions that abolish or homogenize SCR lower BVR.

Interventions ar e grouped by type (RyR modula interven tions except caffeine result in a signif icant lowering of DAD incidence and a concomitant BVR without changing APD 90. *; P<0.05 versus HMR1556 + ISO. Several studies have shown that Ca2+/CaMKII is an important signaling molecule affecting Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) and that its inhibition can be antiarrhythmic 24. Curran et al. 25 demonstrated that SR Ca2+ leak durinJ\u0003$5\u0003 stimulation is mediated by CaMKII. In our experiments, inhibition of calmodulin using W7 reduced DAD incidence in all cells (f rom 44% to 8% at 1000 ms CL, P<0.05) and completely abolished them in 3/7 cells . The decrease in DAD occurrence was paralleled by a decrease in BVR. Average APD was unaltered by W7, and systolic contractions remained intact. Application of the CaMKII inhibitor KN93 led to similar results ( Figure 8 , black bars). 100 SPONTANEOUS CALCIUM RELEASE AND REPOLIZATION Mg2+ has been shown to suppress both EADs and DADs in different models 26, 27 and is used clinically as a first-line agent against TdP. 5 abolished DADs induced after HMR1556 and ISO in 4/7 cells. In the remaining 3 cells, DAD incidence was signif icantly reduced. A concomitant reduction in BVR was seen. AP Ds were not significantly altered, and although systolic contractions were slightly reduced comp ared to beats that did not show SCR events before Mg2+, they remained stable, suggesting that the SR content remained constant (not shown). Similar results (albeit with reduced APD) were obtained with the class-IC antiarrhythmic agent flecainide ( Figure 8 , striped bars), which has been shown to be effective in preventing catecholaminergic polymorphic VT due to its effects on RyR and Na+ channels 28. 4.3.4 Increases in [Ca2+]O Can Reinstate SCR Only When (Residual) RyR Function is Available We hypothesized that increases in [Ca2+@O after intervention s that reduced DAD occurrence would lead to recurrence of SCR, DADs and increase BVR. Therefore, we raised the [Ca2+@O from 1.8 mmol/L to 3.6 mmol/L af ter application of ryanodine, tetracaine, or W7. This led to a reinduction of DADs after tetracaine or W7, and a significant decrease of APD ( Figure 9A - C ). However, raising [Ca2+@O after ryanodine did not lead to DADs, nor did it alter BVR, indicating that RyR function is required for SCR and without this BVR cannot be altered. Interestingly, BVR was not significantly reincr eased after W7 and high [Ca2+@O, whereas after tetracaine and high [Ca2+@O it was, despite DADs being reinstated under both conditions ( Figure 9B, C ). In the presence of W7, APs following SCR were no longer prolonged ( Figure , inset ). These data suggest that calmodulin inhibition has a direct effect on the co upling between SCR and APD, possibly via I CaL. 101 CHAPTER 4 Figure 9: Effect of increased [Ca2+@o on APD 90 (top panels), DAD occurence (middle panels), and BVR (bottom panels) unde r baseline conditions, HMR1556 + ISO, HMR1556 + ISO + Intervention or HMR1556 + ISO + Intervention + 3.6 mmol/L [Ca2+@o.

After pacing to steady state, a partial release of SR Ca2+ was induced during diastole. After this release, APD was prolonged, consistent with experimental observations (Figure 10A ; 1000-ms CL in the presence of ISO). The prolonged APD was associated with a decreased CaT, an in crease in the sustained component of I CaL and increased I Ks. The increase in I Ks was due to the increased plateau potential resulting from the larger I CaL and counteracted the repolarization delay. As such, APD prolongation was significantly larger when I Ks was inhibited ( Figure 10B ). An increase in plateau V m was also observed in expe rimental recordings (maximum amplitude of plateau was 114\u00b11 mV with out prior DAD and 118\u00b11 mV following DADs at 1000 ms CL in the presence of HMR1556 + ISO, P<0.05). 102 SPONTANEOUS CALCIUM RELEASE AND REPOLIZATION Several currents underlying the ventricu lar AP are modified by intracellular Ca2+. To determine the relative contribution of each component, we used the model to selectively inhibit each curre nt for one final beat at steady state following either a normal diastole or SCR. Inhibition of the main currents (I NaCa and I Cl(Ca) 3, 29) only had a minor impact on the APD differences in the presence and absence of SCR (Figure 10C ). In contrast, inhibition of I CaL or RyR was able to significantly reduce the DAD-provoked APD prolongation. More specifically, when only Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) of I CaL was inhibited, APD after SCR was no longer prolonged compared to APD without prior SCR ( Figure 10C ). Further investigation showed any d i f f e r e n c e s i n A P D i n t h e s e c o n d i t i o n s w e r e d u e t o ' p r i m i n g ' o f C D I d u e t o a transition of L-type Ca 2+ channels to the Ca2+-dependent tier of the Markov model induced by the Ca2+ that was released during the SCR, prior to activation of inhibition. Combined, our data implicate reduced SR Ca 2+-release-dependent inactivation of I CaL as the mechanism underlying APD prolongation after SCR. This prediction was confirmed under voltage-clamp conditions in native canine ventricular myocytes when the extracellular solution was modified to isolate I CaL (Figure 11 ). 103 CHAPTER 4 Figure 10: Computational model of the canine ventricular myocyte implicates reduced SR Ca2+-dependent inactivation of I CaL to cause APD prolongation.

Prolongation and Dispersion, and Arrhythmogenesis in the Intact Canine Heart To evaluate whether the single-cell mechanisms described could affect arrhythmogenesis in-vivo, we employed a canine model of drug-induced LQT1 11. Application of a bolus of ISO during continuous HMR1556 infusion resulted in aftercontractions exclusively in the LVP signal prior to the development of ventricular premature beats and TdP ( Figure 12A ) . I n p a r a l l e l w i t h t h e o c c u r r e n c e o f aftercontractions, we observed pa radoxical QT prolongation during $5 heart-rate 105 CHAPTER 4 acceleration, resulting in a significant increase of the QT interval in the last sinus beats prior to the extrasystoles triggering TdP ( Figure 12B ). Similarly, LV MAP duration was significantly pr olonged in these beats and a significant increase in Tpeak-Tend interval was noted ( Figure 12B ), which could reflect an increased repolarization. Figure 12: Aftercontractions and repolarization pr olongation precede the occurrence of TdP in an in-vivo canine model of LQT1. 106 SPONTANEOUS CALCIUM RELEASE AND REPOLIZATION A.

D. Effect of diastolic Ca2+ release in 25% of the cells on average repo larization time (top) and spatia l dispersion of repolarization (bottom) in 1-dimensional strand simulations an d 2-dimensional tissue simulations with intact or disabled I CaL CDI. We focused on repolarization duration by comparing the beats preceding and following the first notable aftercontraction. QT, LV MAP and T peak-Tend durations were significantly increased in the beat after the first aftercontraction, whereas the RR intervals were unchanged ( Figure 12C ). Furthermore, the I CaL inhibitor verapamil (0.4 mg/kg) prevented TdP induction by IS O HMR1556 infusion in animals ( Figure 12A ), although some ventricular extrasystolic activity could still be observed ( Figure 13 ). Similar chronotropic response s were seen after ISO in the presence of verapamil but, in the absence of aftercontractions, QT, LV MAP and T peak-Tend prolongation were significantly smal ler when compared to HMR1556 and ISO alone ( Figure 12B ). These data illustrate the role of Ca2+-dependent regional repolarization prolongation for TdP induction in this model. To further test the hypothesis that SCR at the single-myocyte level can contribute to the QT and T peak-Tend interval prolongation seen in-vivo, we performed computer simulations of both a homogeneous one-di mensional strand and a two-dimensional tissue of Consistent with our hypothesis, diastolic SR Ca 2+ release increased repolariza tion duration and spatial di spersion of repolarization in both simulations ( Figures 12D, 14 and 15 ), and this effect was completely abolished by inhibition of I CaL CDI ( Figure 12D and 16 ). 107 CHAPTER 4 Figure 13: A.

Average repolarization time (activation time + APD 90; left panel) and spatial dispersion of repo larization (maximum re polarization time - minimum repolarization time; righ t panel) as a function of the number of cells with diastolic SR Ca2+ release (SCR). SCR caused a progressive increase in the average repolarization time. Dispersion of repolarization was influenced by the number of cells with SCR (with a maximum around 50%). A low spatial dispersion of repola rization was expected at 100%, when all cells exhibit SCR. However, spatial dispersion of repo larization also depends on the timing of the SCR. Since SCR was initiated at the same time in all cells, but the time of Ca2+-induced Ca2+- release differs due to action potential propagatio n along the strand, there is a longer time for SR refilling after the SCR in cell 128 than in ce ll 1. As such, the amount of APD prolongation differs throughout the strand resulting in an increased spatial dispersion even at 100%. Spatial dispersion of repolarization is a comple x, non-monotonic function that depends on the number of cells with SCR, their location in the strand, the timing of the SCR and the conduction velocity. 109 CHAPTER 4 Figure 15: Multicellular simulations in homogeneous two-dimensional tissue of 200x200 nodes in the presence of ISO and I Ks blockade.

The location of these ce lls is indicated with stars in panels B and C (left). APD90 of each AP is given below each beat in the corresponding color. Diastolic SR Ca 2+ release was induced from 1925 to 1950 ms (indicated by arrows) for a region of 100x100 cells (25% of the cells) around the center of the tissue (i.e., cells with x and y coordinates between 50 and 150, dashed box in panels B and C).

Average repolarization time was 291 ms and spatial dispersion of repolarization (maximum -minimum repolarization time) was 29 ms. The eight smaller panels on the right show voltage maps at differen t time instants. The voltage maps show a homogeneous diastolic interval followed by a planar wave propagating from left to right following pacing (conduction velocity of 49 cm/s). Repolarization occurs uniformly around 1290 ms. C. Similar to panel B for beat 3 which is preceded by diastolic Ca 2+ release in a subset of the cells. Average repolarization time is longer (305 ms) and shows increased spatial dispersion (45 ms), in line with one-dimensional simula tions and in-vivo experimental data. Voltage maps identify the DAD in the center of the tissue and the prolonged repolarization of this same ar ea during the following beat. 110 SPONTANEOUS CALCIUM RELEASE AND REPOLIZATION Figure 16: Multicellular simulations in homogene ous two-dimensional tissue of 200x200 nodes in the presence of ISO and I Ks blockade after inhibition of Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) of I CaL. Simulation protocol and figure layout are identical to Figure 15 , except for the inhibition of CDI for these 5 beats (after pacing to steady-state in the presence of ISO and I Ks blockade). Inhibiting CDI prolongs APD9 0, consistent with experimental data 30 and single-cell simulations ( Figure 10 ). Inhibition of CDI prevents APD prolongation following diastolic SR Ca2+ release despite similar DAD and systolic Ca2+ transient properties and prevents increased spatial dispersion of repolarization. No te that due to this APD prolongation different time-points were used for the voltage maps in panels B and C (indicated in purple). 111 CHAPTER 4 4.4 Discussion In this study, we elucidated the relationship between SCR, AP prolongation and BVR in canine LV myocytes and provide argument s for its arrhythmogenic significance in the in-vivo beating heart. Ou r data indicate that under conditions of ISO-induced Ca2+ loading, SCR can occur over a wide rang e of pacing CLs and that APD following SCR is significantly prolonged. Reduce d CICR-dependent inactivation of I CaL after SCR is involved in this AP prolongation. The increase in BVR was strongly dependent on the degree of APD prolongation after SCR. In anesthetized dogs subjected to similar conditions, we observed the occurrence of mo unting aftercontractions in parallel with QT, T peak-Tend and LV MAP prolongation just prior to TdP which could be prevented by inhibition of I CaL and Ca2+ l o a d w i t h v e r a p a m i l . S C R-related repolarization prolongation was reproduced in multicellular computer si mulations. Our data align ZLWK\u0003UHFHQW\u0003GDWD\u0003VKRZLQJ\u0003WKDW\u0003ORFDO\u0003$5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ\u0003V\\QFKURQL]H V\u00036&5\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003QRUPDO\u0003 rabbit heart, leading to Ca2+-mediated focal arrhythmia 31. In the setting of exaggerated spatio-temporal dispersion of repolarization such focal activity may trigger TdP, as actually observed in the canine model of drug-induced LQT1 V\\QGURPH\u0003DQG\u0003$5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ\u0003 VHH\u0003DOVR\u000311). Previous cellular studies 32 - 34 have shown that large CaTs result in abbreviation of APD, whereas a small CaT after SR Ca2+ depletion corresponds to prolonged APD. In agreement, we find substantial APD prolon gation after application of ryanodine due to reduced CDI of I CaL. Furthermore I CaL CDI is sensitive to (partial) SR Ca2+ unloading by SCR. These changes in CDI ar e sufficient to modulate APD on a beat- to-beat basis over a wide range of CLs. Interestingly, Spence r and Sham reported the opposite effect in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes perhaps due to species differences in the balance of NCX and I CaL 35. In the present study, we used Ca2+- sensitive fluorescent probes and cell shortening as Ca2+ indicators. Both measures reflect cytosolic Ca2+ levels, which are substantially different from the subsarcolemmal [Ca2+@\u0003LQIOXHQFLQJ\u0003&D2+-activated membrane currents. 4.4.1 The Importance of I Ks Blockade Burashnikov and Antzelevitch 36 demonstrated that I Ks block alone was insufficient to induce DADs or modulate repolarization heterogeneit y in canine transmural ventricular tissues 36. However, it amplified the effect s of adrenergic stimuli. At the myocyte level, we have previously shown that I Ks blockade (via KCNQ1 inhibition 37) has minimal effects on APD and BVR under baseline conditions. D XULQJ\u0003 $5\u0003 stimulation and I Ks blockade, BVR is signif icantly increased and this is at least partly dependent on [Ca2+@i 14. Here we extend this by dete rmining an important role for CDI of I CaL, at least in the presence of SC R. Under baseline conditions, I Kr is the main repolarizing current in canine ventri cular myocytes and inhibition of I Kr can cause 112 SPONTANEOUS CALCIUM RELEASE AND REPOLIZATION EADs due to APD prolongation and subsequent I CaL reactivation 14. During additional $5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ\u000f\u0003WKH\u0003EDODQFH\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003UHSRODUL]DWLRQ\u0003UHVHUYH\u0003LV\u0003D OWHUHG\u0003DQG\u0003WKH\u0003UROH\u0003RI\u0003 IKs becomes more prominent; enhanced I Ks prevents repolarization instability and EAD generation by other proarrhyt hmic mechanisms (e.g., I Kr inhibition or augmentation of late I Na). In contrast, inhibition of I Ks GXULQJ\u0003$5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ\u0003OHDGV\u0003WR\u0003$3'\u0003 prolongation, increased BVR and EADs indicating WKDW\u0003XQGHU\u0003RXU\u0003FRQGLWLRQV\u0003ZLWK\u0003$5\u0003 stimulation, I Ks is a major contributor to re polarization. Barandi et al. 38 have previously shown that the degree of APD prolongation induced by pharmacological block of repolarizing currents or augmenta tion of depolarizing currents, depends on baseline APD. Consistent with these re sults, we find a more pronounced APD prolongation after SCR at slow CL and in the presence of I Ks blockade. In our experiments, APD prolongation after SCR is particularly pronounced because the increase in I CaL also elevates the plateau potential which increases I Ks activation and offsets the prolongation induced by I CaL (Figure 10A , bottom panel). This compensating mechanism is absent when I Ks is inhibited. Thus, I Ks inhibition exacerbates the effect of SCR on APD prolongation. 4.4.2 The Role of SCR in Arrhythmogenesis It has long been established that SCR-induced triggered activity is a major arrhythmogenic mechanism during Ca 2+ overload and its occurrence is increased in various pathological conditions 6, 39. Here we observed that diastolic SCR prolongs the subsequent APD, suggesting that even SCR below the threshold for triggered activity has important electrophysiological effect s that may be proarrhythmic. Regional prolongation of APD after SCR in the intact heart may cause increased spatial dispersion of repolarization be tween regions with the highest Ca2+ load (generating SCR) and regions with lower Ca2+ loading. In agreement with this hypothesis, we observed increased QT duration and T peak-Tend intervals following the first aftercontraction upon a challeng e with a bolus of ISO during I Ks blockade in-vivo. Regional heterogeneit ies in ion-channel expression or intercellular conduction may further amplify this dispersion. Combined, these mechanisms can promote functional reentry. Stabilization of Ca 2+ handling may therefore not only reduce the incidence of arrhythmogenic triggers but also prevent their reentrant perpetuation. Although current pharmacological intervention s do not allow specific targeting of SCR or measurement of cellular Ca2+ handling in the in-vivo dog heart, we found that I CaL inhibition with verapamil could prevent aftercontractions and TdP in our model of LQT1, and this was associated with a reduction in the paradoxical increase in QT and T peak-Tend intervals following ISO. 113 CHAPTER 4 We have also shown that the combination of ISO and fast pacing can give rise to diastolic SCR which prolongs APD sufficiently such that the next SCR occurs before the end of repolarization, generating an EAD. The common dependence of DADs and EADs on SCR in the presence of ISO has previously been described 5, 19 and is in agreement with recent findings in rabbit ventricular myocytes 20. Our results provide novel mechanistic insights on the coupling between SCR, APD prolongation and EAD occurrence and illustrate that diastolic SC R is a central element in both triggered activity and repolarization instability. However, the ionic mechanisms of EAD generation, particularly the relative roles of I NCX and I CaL, are complex and cannot be fully determined based on our data. Moreover, the measurement of the lag between the start of the aftercontraction and the EAD upstroke does not take into account the delay between SCR and activation of contractio n or the SCR-induced slowing of repolarization in the prim ing phase before the EAD upst roke. This lag is likely due to differential Ca 2+ thresholds for the activation of contraction versus the activation of membrane currents. APD prolongation after SCR results from increased I CaL, which enhances Ca2+ loading via increased sarcolemmal Ca2+ influx. Enhanced loadin g along with reduced Ca2+ efflux serves to restore and fine-tune SR Ca2+ content to maintain CICR efficacy, as has previously been described in rat ventricular myocytes 32, 34. However, during increased Ca2+ load these mechanisms will readjust, promoting SCR, facilitating the occurrence of afterdepolarizatio ns. Consistent with this reasoning, we found that the probability of observing a DAD was not signif icantly altered by the presence of a DAD on the previous beat. This strongly implie s that, under our experimental conditions, the reduction in myocyte Ca2+ load during a DAD is overcome by the increased sarcolemmal Ca2+ influx during the following prol onged AP. Thus, APD prolongation after SCR contributes to the vicious cycle of Ca2+ loading and ultimately overload. These results are in agreement with the recent modeling study by Morotti et al. who established that I CaL predominantly inactivates due to CDI and that (strongly) reduced CDI can cause Ca2+ overload and DADs 40. Inhibition of SCR by ryanodine and tetracaine has previously been described 19, 22, and the results presented here agree with those data. We extend these observations by showing a concomitant decrease in BVR. Both ryanodine and tetracaine are useful for mechanistic studies but due to their delete rious effects in vivo cannot be used as therapeutic agents. In contrast, both ma gnesium and flecainide are commonly used antiarrhythmic agents. Here we show that both these agents can lead to a reduction in BVR and arrhythmogenic events, most likely due to stabilization of Ca 2+ handling i n t h e s i n g l e m y o c y t e . S i m i l a r l y , w e confirm the usefulness of modulating Calmodulin/CaMKII during increased Ca2+ loading as an antiarrhythmic strategy 24. CaMKII phosphorylation has been shown to induce a different gating mode (mode 2) of the I CaL channel, thereby reducing inactivation, favoring Ca2+ entry and 114 SPONTANEOUS CALCIUM RELEASE AND REPOLIZATION the occurrence of EADs and DADs 41. Interestingly, when CAMK II inhibition is applied a disconnect appears between SCR events and APD. Whether this is due to alterations in Ca2+-dependent inactivation, or due to effects on other CAMKII substrates, such as I NaL, is not clear and further investig ation is warranted. In this regard, the development of selective CaMKII modulators suitable for antiarrhythmic interventions in humans is awaited. 4.4.3 Conclusions We have shown that after SCR, inactivating I CaL is increased and APD and QT intervals are prolonged, most likely due to reduced CICR-dependent inactivation of this current. The degree of APD prolonga tion is exacerbated by inhibition of I Ks. This contributes to increased BVR and spatial dispersi on of repolarization during ISO-induced diastolic Ca2+ release and, aside from DAD- mediated triggered activity, may be an additional mechanism contributi ng to arrhythmogenesis. Pharmacological interventions that regularize SCR or SCR with or without preserved systolic contractions reduce BVR. Our data prov ide novel insights into arrhythmogenic mechanisms during increased Ca 2+ loading. 4.5 Acknowledgements The authors thank Drs.

Analyses were performed using these steady-state data. 122 SPONTANEOUS CALCIUM RELEASE AND REPOLIZATION Data Analysis Detection of EADs, DADs and determination of APD, BVR and DAD parameters was done in a semi-automated fashion using a custom Matlab (The Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) script. Briefly, Axon (Axon Instru ments, CA, USA) data files were loaded into Matlab. AP upstroke was detected base d on peaks in the numerically calculated dV/dt, and APD 90 was determined. Subsequently, the diastolic interval between APD 90 of one beat and the point of maximum dV/dt of the next beat was processed for all beats. The signal was low-pass filtered at 30 Hz to reduce noise. All peaks in the filtered signal were determ ined and resting membrane po tential was defined as the average value between the smallest (most negative) local maximum and local minimum. The amplitude of all other peaks was determined relati ve to this resting membrane potential. DADs were identified as a local maximum in the filtered signal of more than 2 mV in amplitude and manua lly confirmed by the investigators.

In-Vivo Dog Model of LQT1 TdP arrhythmias were induced in an in-vivo dog model of long QT 1 syndrome as previously described 9. Briefly, general anesthesia was induced in 10 beagle dogs by l (0.025 mg/kg i.v.), and continuous infusion of etomidate (1.5 mg/kg/hour). Dogs were ventilated with 30% oxygen in pressurized air to normocap nia. The body temperature was kept at 37\u00b0C with a heated water mattress. ECG stan dard lead II was continuously recorded and the QT interval (QT; ms) measured from the onset of the QRS to the final end of the T wave.

Both timing (start, duration) and amplitude of diastolic SR Ca2+ release could be controlled. In particular, the model was divi ded into two identical domains ( Figure 1 ) coupled by Ca2+ diffusion between cytosol and network SR to simulate the loca l origin of SCR. Diffusion time constants were based on the local control model by Restrepo et al. 12. and diffusion was significantl y slower in SR compared to cytosol, consistent with experimental observations 13. The late component of I Na (INaL) was increased in the model to simulate the midmyoca rdial origin of the myocytes used in our experiments, consistent with experimental data from Zygmunt et al. 14. Model APD rate dependence at baseline, in the presence of ISO and in the presence of ISO+HMR1556 (simulated as 100% inhibition of I Ks) was consistent with experimental data ( Figure 2A ). Parameters of the L-type Ca2+ current were adjusted based on the experiments in the presence of ryanodine to obtain quantitative agreement on the amount of APD prol ongation in the absence of SR Ca2+ release. To initiate SCR, steady-state RyR activation was set to a constant value in one of the two domains for the interval of diastolic SR Ca2+ release such that the desired reduction in local JSR Ca2+ was achieved. When steady-state RyR activation was set to 0.375 (SCR level= 0.375) from t = 925 ms until t = 950 ms (at CL = 1000 ms), the SCR-induced prolongation of APD was consistent with experimental observations (Figure 2B ). The model was paced to steady state (2000 seconds of pacing) in the presence of $5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ\u0003ZLWK\u0003RU\u0003ZLWKRXW\u0003, Ks inhibition, to mimic experimental conditions. The effect of diastolic SR Ca2+ release was examined by determining APD of a single beat at steady-state as a function of the timi ng and amplitude of the preceding diastolic Ca2+ release. In some simulations other currents / fluxes (I CaL, INaCa, ICl(Ca), Jrel) were blocked for the duration of this final beat. One-dimensional strand simulations were performed as previously described 15. Steady-state conditions of single-cell si mulation in the presence of ISO and I Ks blockade were used as initial conditions for the homogeneous strand of 128 cells. The strand was subsequently paced by direct stimulation of the first 3 cells (-80 pA/pF for 2.0 ms) for 100 seco nds to achieve steady-state conditions for the strand. The effect of diastolic SR Ca2+ release was determined by applying the methodology described above to k cells in the middle of the strand. SR Ca2+ release was initiated simultaneously in all k cells. The exact mechanisms by which SCR synchronizes across a sufficient number of myocytes to generate ventricular ectopic beats remain 124 SPONTANEOUS CALCIUM RELEASE AND REPOLIZATION incompletely understood. Recent research by Wasserstrom et al. has suggested that an intrinsic synchronization occurs due to a decrease in variability of SCR events with increasing Ca2+ load 16, 17. )XUWKHUPRUH\u000f\u00030\\OHV\u0003HW\u0003DO\u0011\u0003KDYH\u0003VKRZQ\u0003WKDW\u0003ORFDOL]HG\u0003$5 can produce spatiotemporal synchronization of SR Ca2+ overload and release, which can produce focal activity and arrhythmia in normal rabbit hearts 18. Although direct diffusion of Ca2+ between cells through gap junctions could further contribute to the synchronization of SCR 19, this was not implemented in the current model because the main goal of the present research was to determine the electrophysiological consequences of SCR, independen t of the synchronization method.

The tissue size was 2 x 2 cm and was simulated using 200 x 200 grid points, in line with previous studies 20, 21. Steady-state conditions of single-cell simulations in the presence of ISO and I Ks blockade were used as initial conditio ns and 5 beats were simulated following stimulation of the left-most column of 200 ce lls (-80 pA/pF for 2.0 ms), resulting in a planar wave activating the entire sheet. Conduction velocity was 49 cm/s. Diastolic SR Ca2+ release was initiated simultaneously in 25% of the 40.000 cells surrounding the center of the tissues (i.e., cells wi th x and y coordinates between 50 and 150).

Th e le ve ls of c A MP a n d th u s th e de gr e e of PKA a c tiva tion a r e f in e ly r e gu la te d by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDE s) that degrade the second messenger into 5'-AMP. Cardiac PDEs degrading cAMP belong to 5 families (PDE1-4 and PDE8) which can be distinguished by distinct enzymatic properties and pharmacology 3. In rodents, PDE3 and PDE4 are the major contributors to the total cAMP-hydrolytic activity 4, 5 and 3'(\u0017\u0003LV\u0003GRPLQDQW\u0003WR\u0003PRGXODWH\u0003 AR regulation of cAMP levels 6 - 9.

In larger mammals, PDE3 acti vity is dominant in microsomal fractions 18 - 20 and PDE3 inhibitors exert a potent positive inotropic effect 21. Selective inhibition of PDE3 with milrinone ha s been shown to improve cardiac contractility in patients with congestive heart failure 22. The role of PDE4 is less well defined but evidence is emergi ng that PDE4 may also play an important role in these species. In the canine heart, a larg e PDE4 activity is found in the cytoplasm 18 but PDE4 is also present in micros omal fractions, where it accounts for ~20% of the activity 19. Recent studies have indicated that PDE4 is expressed in human ventricle where, similar t R\u0003URGHQWV\u000f\u0003LW\u0003DVVRFLDWHV\u0003ZLWK\u0003$5V\u000f\u00035\\5\u0015\u0003 and phospholamban 5, 13. Moreover, PDE4 controls ECC and arrhythmias in human atrium 23. The right (RV) and left (LV) ventricles originate from different progenitor cells 24, 25 and differ in several importan t ways. Both ventricles have different mass (under normal conditions LV mass is ~6-fold RV mass), volume, morphologies and pressures 26, 27. Electrical heterogeneity has be en well characterized between ventricular epicardial, endocard ial and midmyocardial layers 28 - 31. Although less studied, different electrophysiological properties were also reported between the two ventricles. In rats and dog, the action potential (AP) is shorter in the RV than in the LV 32, 33. In dog, the notch in phase 1 of the AP is deeper in the RV than the LV 33, 34. These differences are related to larger repolarizing K+ currents, I TO and I Ks in dog RV 33, 34. In this species, a larger RV I Ks correlates with a higher expression of KCNQ1 and KCNE1, the principal and auxiliary subunit of the I Ks channel, respectively 35. 133 CHAPTER 5 Regional heterogeneity between the LV and the RV may also exist for ATP-activated K+ current, I KATP 36, 37. In contrast to these electrophysiological studies, a recent proteomic study reported no difference in the expression level of more than 600 proteins between the RV and the LV from pig and rabbit. Most of th ese were contractile/structural proteins, oxidative phosphorylation components, and enzymes from intermediary metabolism. No plasma membrane voltage-gated ion ch annels were analyzed, but a few major Ca2+ handling (SERCA2, RyR2) and signal transduction components (Ca2+\u0012&DOPRGXOLQ\u0003NLQDVH\u0003,,\u000f\u00033.$\u0003W\\SH\u0003,\u0003DQG\u0003,, \u0003VKRZHG\u0003QR\u0003YDULDWLRQ\u0003 LQ\u0003H[SUHVVLRQ\u0003 level 38. These studies raise the question of whether functional differences between the LV and the RV are limited to electrophysiological features or extend to other aspects of ventricular function. Surprisingly, only limi ted information is available concerning ECC and its neurohumoral regulation in RV ve rsus LV comparisons. However, previous reports in rat have shown that, despite similar interventricular expression levels, a higher proportion of the total SERCA2a pool is associated with phospholamban, resulting in lower Ca 2+ reuptake rate and prolonged Ca2+ transients in RV myocytes compared with LV myocytes 39. In mouse, opposite inotropic responses to 1-AR stimulation were reported, and attributed to different effects on myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity 40. In human, recent clinical studies in dicate that ventricular load increases more for the RV than the LV during exercise 41 and this may reflect, at least partly, the relative differences in ma ximal pulmonary-arterial versus aortic pressure rise. It is currently unclear whether interventricular differences exist in the sympathetic responsiveness of the human heart. In canine, stimulation of the cardiac symp athetic nerves induces greater changes in contractile force in the RV than in the LV 42. These changes are insensitive to 1-AR blockade by phentolamin H\u000f\u0003LPSOLFDWLQJ\u0003GLIIHUHQFHV\u0003LQ\u0003 AR response 43.

The cells were depolarized every 8 s from -50 to 0 mV during 400 ms. The use of -50 mV as ho lding potential allowed the inactivation of voltage-dependent Na + currents.

The loaded cells were field-stimulated (5 V, 4 ms) at a frequency of 0.3 Hz. Then, sarcomere length and Fura-2 ratio (measured at 512 nm upon excitation at 340 nm and 380 nm) were simultaneously recorded using an IonOptix System (IonOp tix, Milton, MA, USA). Cell contraction was assessed as the percentage of sarcomere shortening, which is the ratio of twitch amplitude (difference of end-diastolic and peak systolic sarcomere lengths) to end-diastolic sarcomere length. Ca 2+-transient amplitude was assessed by the percentage of variation of the Fura-2 ratio, by dividing the twitch amplitude (difference of end-diastolic and peak systolic ratios) to end-diastolic ratio. All parameters were calculated o ffline with dedicated software (IonWizard 6x, IonOptix). 5.2.7 FRET Measurements The same Ringer solution as described above for Ca 2+ transients and cell shortening measurements was used in these experime nts. Images were captured every 5 s using the 40x oil immersion objective of a Nikon TE 300 inverted microscope connected to a software-controlled (Met afluor, Molecular De vices, Sunnyvale, California, USA) cooled charge coupled ( CCD) camera (Sensicam PE; PCO, Kelheim, Germany). CFP was excited during 150-300 ms by a Xenon lamp (100 W, Nikon, Champigny-sur-Marne, France) using a 440/2 0BP filter and a 455LP dichroic mirror. Dual-emission imaging of CFP and YFP was using an Optosplit II emission splitter (Cairn Research, Faversham, UK) equipped with a 495LP dichroic mirror and BP filters 470/30 and 535/30, respectively. A region of interest including the entire cell was used for measurement of aver age CFP and YFP intensity. CFP and YFP intensities were background corrected and the YFP emission was corrected for CFP bleed through. The ratio of CFP over corrected YFP was used as an index of cAMP concentration. 137 CHAPTER 5 5.2.8 Reagents Cilostamide was from Tocris was from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany) . Unless specified, all other drugs were from Sigma (Saint Quentin, France).

For statistical evaluation the paired and unpaired Student's t-test were used, and a difference was considered statistically significant when P was <0.05. 5.3 Results 5.3.1 In Vivo Inotropic Response to Isoproterenol in RV and LV Pressure recordings were obtained simultaneously from the RV and LV at baseline and during infusion of ISO in anesthetiz ed beagle dogs. Representative examples relative to the ECG are shown in Figure 1A . At baseline, syst olic pressures and dP/dt max were significantly higher in the LV than in the RV ( Figure 1B ). For example, dP/dt max was Hg/s in the LV versus 534\u00b145 mm Hg/s in the RV (P<0.001). Upon ISO, dP/dt max increased ~3.4-fold in the LV compared to almost 5- fold in the RV (P<0.05 ; Figure 1B , left panel ). Accordingly, the relative increase in V\\VWROLF\u0003SUHVVXUH\u0003E\\\u0003 AR stimulation was significantl y higher in the RV than LV, reaching on average 66\u00b119 mm Hg (+61\u00b16%) and 172\u00b131 mm Hg (+20\u00b14%), respectively during ISO ( Figure 1B , right panel ). Complete recovery from the positive inotropic response ( Figure 1C ) occurred faster in the LV than the RV after the ISO bolus infusions ( Figure 1C , not show discernable interven tricular differences from baseline to ISO. 138 INTERVENTRICULAR DIFFERENCES IN BETA-ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR SIGNALING Figure 1: Differential r HVSRQVH\u0003WR\u0003$5 stimulation in the LV versus RV in anesthetized dogs A.

There was no significant difference in basal sarcomere length, ( Table 1 ). As shown by the individual traces of Figure 2A and 2B, a pulse application of ISO (100 nM, 15 s) increased the amplitud e of sarcomere shortening and Ca2+ transient in both LVMs and RVMs, but these effects were exacerbated in RVMs. Indeed, on average ISO increased sarcomere shortening by ~25-fold in RVMs versus ~10- versus 2-fold in LVMs (Figure 2C and 2D). 139 CHAPTER 5 Table 1 RVMs N LVMs n Contraction SL (m) 1.74\u00b10.01 20 18 (P<0.05) 13 Table 1: Basal parameters measured in RVMs and LV Ms. The effect of ISO lasted also longer in RVMs than in LVMs, as indicated by the time to half-maximal recovery (t 1/2off) of sarcomere shortening (79\u00b111 s in versus 54\u00b13 in and Ca2+ transient (82\u00b17 s in RVMs versus 49\u00b16 s in LVMs). These results indicate th at the differential in vivo positive inotropic effects by ISO have a cellular origin. 5.3.3 AR Regulation of Cytoplasmic cAMP Signals and PKA Activity in RV and LV Midmyocytes 6LQFH\u0003 AR stimulation of ECC involves cAMP mobilization, this second messenger was measured in intact LVMs and RVMs by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) using the cytoplasmic sensor Epac2-camps 47. Figure 3A shows pseudocolor images of a LVM and a RVM expressing Epac 2-camps. At 1 min after application of ISO (100 nM, 15 s), the CFP/YFP ratio increased to a greater extent in RVMs than in LVMs. As shown in Figure 3B , ISO led to a transient increase in the CFP/YFP ratio t h a t w a s o n a v e r a g e ~ 2 - f o l d h i g h e r i n R V M s v e r s u s L V M s ( P < 0 . 0 0 1 ) r e f l e c t i n g enhanced cytoplasmic cAMP accumulation in RVMs. Because PKA is the primary target of cAMP for short-te r m r e g u l a t i o n o f E C C , c y t o p l a s m i c P K A a c t i v i t y w a s monitored using the PKA FRET sensor AKAR3-NES 49. As shown in the illustrative pseudocolor image of Figure 3C and on the average time course of Figure 3D , although the maximal increase in YFP/CFP ratio was identical at 1 min, the signal decayed faster in LVMs than RVMs and be came significantly higher in RVMs than LVMs after 2 min. This indicates that cytoplasmic PKA activity was higher in RVMs than in /90V\u0003LQ\u0003UHVSRQVH\u0003WR\u0003 AR stimulation. 140 INTERVENTRICULAR DIFFERENCES IN BETA-ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR SIGNALING Figure 2: AR Regulation of ECC in LV and RV Midm yocytes (A, B) Raw traces of sarcomere shortening A. and Ca2+ transients B. recorded in Fura-2 loaded LVMs and RVMs paced at 0.3 Hz.

The lack of difference in the YFP/CFP ratio at the beginning of the stimulation was most likely due to saturation of the AKAR3-NES sensor at this concentration of ISO, as indicated by the lack of a sharp peak in RVMs and by previous experiments in rat ventricular myocytes showing that a ~ 40% change in YFP/CFP represents the maximal FRET change that can be obtained with this sensor (data not shown). 141 CHAPTER 5 Figure 3: RV Midmyocytes Display Enhanced cAMP Accumulation and PKA Activity in 5HVSRQVH\u0003WR\u0003 AR Stimulation.

To our surprise, comparison of LVMs and 590V\u0003UHYHDOHG\u0003QR\u0003GLIIHUHQFH\u0003LQ\u0003VXEVDUFROHPPDO\u0003F$03\u0003 >F$03@SP \u0003J HQHUDWHG\u0003E\\\u0003 AR stimulation with an ISO pulse. Indee d, neither the maximal cAMP elevation nor its decay kinetics was different between LVMs and RVMs ( Figure 4A ). We next wondered whether the same was true for the major sarcolemmal targets of the AR/cAMP/PKA pathway, I CaL and I Ks. As shown in Table 1 , there was no difference in basal I CaL density between RVMs and LVMs. A pulse stimulation with ISO 142 INTERVENTRICULAR DIFFERENCES IN BETA-ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR SIGNALING (100 nM, 15 s) resulted in a similar transient increase of I CaL between LVMs and RVMs, both in terms of amplitude and duration ( Figure 4B ) . I n c o n t r a s t t o I CaL, basal I Ks density was higher in RVMs than LVMs ( Table 1 ), which is consistent with earlier ILQGLQJV\u0003 \u0016\u0016 \u0011\u0003+RZHYHU\u000f\u0003SXOVH\u0003 AR stimulation increased I Ks to in LVMs and RVMs ( Figure 4C ).

W e n e x t investigated whether phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are involved in the differences in cytoplasmic cAMP accumulation observed between RVMs and LVMs upon AR stimulation. We first tested the impl ication of PDE3, beca use of its critical importance for the control of cardiac contractility in dog 21. Thus, myocytes expressing Epac2-camps were challenged with ISO (100 nM, 15 s) in the presence of the specific PDE3 inhibi tor cilostamide (Cil, 1 M), and the inhibitor was maintained during ISO washout. Figure 5A shows that Cil doubled the maximal amplitude of the ISO-induced cAMP transien t in LVMs, while having little effect in RVMs. Cil also profoundly impaired cAMP recovery in both LVMs and RVMs, as indicated by the ~3-fold increase in time to half maximal decay (t 1/2off) values ( Figure 5A ). We next tested the implication of PDE4, which represents the major soluble cAMP-PDE activity in dog ventricle 18 by using the specific PDE4 inhibitor Ro-201724 (Ro, 10 M). Figure 5B shows that Ro induced a 3-fold incr ease in the amplitude of the cAMP transient elicited by ISO in LVMs and a 2-fo ld increase in RVMs. PDE4 inhibition also significantly delayed cAMP re covery, as demonstrated by a ~2.5-fold increase in time-to-half-maximal decay (t 1/2off) PDE4 F$03\u0003 DFFXPXODWLRQ\u0003 XSRQ\u0003 AR stimulation in canine ventricular m i d m y o c y t e s .

As shown in Figure 6A , inhibition of PDE3 with 1 M Cil had no effect on the maximal cAMP elevation at the plasma membrane but dela yed cAMP recovery in LVMs and RVMs. Interestingly, the difference in average t 1/2off values between ISO and ISO+Cil reached statistical signif icance only in LVMs (t 1/2off was 107\u00b117 s for ISO, and 232\u00b150 s for ISO+Cil, P<0.05 whereas in RVMs, t 1/2off was 112\u00b117 s for ISO alone and 171\u00b139 s for ISO+Cil, p=0.36) suggesting a stronger 590V\u0003 WR\u0003 F$03\u0003 K\\GURO\\VLV\u0003 XSRQ\u0003 AR stimulation. In sharp contrast to what was observed in the cytoplasm, PDE4 inhibition with Ro at 10 M had no effect, neither on the amplitude nor on the recovery kinetics of the cAMP transient generated by ISO pulse stimulation at the plasma membrane ( Figure 6B ). We next investigated the respective contribution of PDE3 and PDE4 to the regulation I CaL and I Ks. 144 INTERVENTRICULAR DIFFERENCES IN BETA-ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR SIGNALING Figure 5: 5HJXODWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003 AR Cytoplasmic cAMP Signals by PDE3 and PDE4 in LVMs and RVMs A.

Thus, PDE3 and PDE4 shape distinct compartmentalized cAMP signals that underlie regionally-specific differences i Q\u0003WKH\u0003FDUGLDF\u0003YHQWULFOHV\u0003XSRQ\u0003 AR stimulation. Recent clinical studies indica te that during intense physical exercise, the afterload of the RV increases more than that of the LV 41, 52. Because the sympathetic system is strongly activated during exercise, these ob servations suggest that the RV could be more sensitive to sympathetic stimulation than the LV in humans. Earlier studies that compared the responsiveness of the LV versus RV to sympathetic nerve stimulation in dog are consistent with this notion: Norr is and Randall showed that stimulation of the left and right ansae subclavia has a stronger inotropic effect in the RV than in the LV 42. Similarly, Abe et al. 43 reported stronger effe cts of sympat hetic nerve stimulation on RV systolic pressure, which were not modified by 1-AR blockade. Thus, previous data suggested WKH\u0003H[LVWHQFH\u0003RI\u0003GLIIHUHQWLDO\u0003 AR stimulation in RV versus LV, but until now its clear demonstr ation has been lackin g and the potential mechanisms involved remain elusive. Our ex periments show that ISO infusion in vivo exerts a stronger relative increase in RV contractility compared to that of the LV (Figure 1 ). Importantly, myocytes isolated from the midmyocardial layer of the RV showed enhanced and pr olonged stimulation of Ca2+ transients and contraction by ISO compared to their LV counterparts ( Figure 2 ). These results demonstrate that the KLJK\u0003VHQVLWLYLW\\\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u000359\u0003WR\u0003 AR stimulation relies at least partly on an intrinsic property of RV myocytes, and ra ise the question of which mechanisms are involved. AR control of cardiac ECC op erates mainly through activation of cAMP and PKA.

Since I CaL was not involved in the enhanced inotropic effect of ISO in RV, other ECC proteins must be differentia lly regulated. Likely candidates are RyR2 and PLB, which control SR Ca2+ release and reuptake by SERCA2a, respectively. Although differential SERCA2a-PLB association was observed in RV versus LV in rat 39, we did not observe differences in the decay kinetics of Ca2+ transients in RV versus LV dog myocytes (data not sho wn). To our knowledge, RyR2 and PLB are differentially phosphorylated in resp onse to ISO stimulation in RV versus LV has not been investigated.

Because in dog PDE3 inhibitors have strong inotropic effects in contra st to PDE4 inhibitors 18, our results raise the question of the functional role of PDE4 in dog. When the respective role of these two PDEs was evaluated on the stimulation of I CaL (Figure 7 ) by ISO, inhibition of PDE3 but not PDE4 significan tly prolonged I CaL upregulation. This is consistent with a predominance of PDE3 in T-tubular membranes, whereas only a fraction of PDE4 is sarcolemmal and most of the activity is soluble 18, 19. However, when PDE3 was inhibited, PDE4 inhibition drastically prolonged I CaL UHFRYHU\\\u0003IURP\u0003 AR stimulation 149 CHAPTER 5 150 (Figure 7 ). Thus, PDE4 can regulate I CaL, but under normal conditions it is masked by the predomi nant PDE3. Therefore, the hierarchy between PDE3 and PDE4 appears to be opp osite in dog compared to rat 9. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that RV and LV d iffer in their sensitivity to AR stimulation both in vivo and in vitro, and reveals r egionally-specific differences in AR coupling to PDE3 and PDE4 and subcellular cAMP compartmentation in the heart. The fact that these results were obtained in a large mammal increases the likelihood that they represent the human situation. If this is the case, such enhanced sensitivity to AR stimulation may be an important factor for RV dysfunction not only in the context of sports medicine, but also in RV failure consequent to left -sided heart failure or pulmonary hypertension. 5.5 Acknowledgments We thank Florence Lefebvre for superb technical assistance, Dr. Viacheslav Nikolaev for providing the Epac2 -camps and pmEpac2 -camps, Dr. Jin Zhang for providing the AKAR3 sensor and Dr. Bertrand Crozatier for helpful discussions.

It blocks various cardiac ion currents at different potencies and has atrial- predominant electrophysiological effects. We investigated the electrophysiological and proarrhythmic effects of AZD1305 ve rsus dofetilide in with chronic complete atrioventricular block (AVB) and myocardial hypertrophic remodeling. In the present study AZD1305 was administered to anesthetized mongrel dogs before and >2 weeks after the induction of AVB and ventricular and atrial electrophysiological parameters were assessed. In all dogs, the selective I Kr blocker dofetilide was used to examine susceptibility to acquired torsades de pointes (TdP) in chronic AVB and for comparison. At normal sinus rhythm, AZD1305 increased QT and RR intervals from 290\u00b17 to 397\u00b115 and from 603\u00b122 to 778\u00b132 ms (+29%, P=0.002), respectively. In the same animals at chronic AVB, AZD1305 increased the QT interval from 535\u00b128 to 747\u00b136 P<0.05), ms (+38%, P<0.0001)). ioventricular rhythm. Whereas all (n=14) chronic-AVB animals exhibited TdP upon do fetilide, the arrhythmia in similar degrees of repolarization dela y as the selective I Kr blocker dofetilide, the combined ion- channel blocker AZD1305 indu ces less repolarization in stability and has a lower ventricular proarrhythmic potentia l in the remodeled dog heart. 158 AZD1305 IN THE REMODELED DOG HEART 6.1 Introduction Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in the Western world, with age-related prevalence re aching >10% in octogenarians 1. It has been predicted that over 5.6 million patients in North-Am erica will be diagnosed with AF by 2050 2. This arrhythmia is a frequent complication of uncorrected hypertension, myocardial ischemia or valvular disease. Moreover, fa milial AF or lone AF without apparent familial segregation is increasingly recognized. Currently, the pharmacological treatments aimed at maintaining sinus rhythm include class I, II and III antiarrhythmic agents. Termination of persis tent AF may require any of these options (with variable effect iveness) or electrical cardioversion. However, none of the aforementioned therapies are considered atrial-specific and cause effects on ventricular electrical activation and repolarization, and some carry an inherent risk of ve ntricular proarrhythmia. The proarrhythmic liability of anti-AF drug s could potentially be circumvented by designing compounds with composite actions on multiple ion channels. Vernakalant, a predominantly atrial-selective compound targeting I Kur, IKr, ITO and I Na 3 was recently approved in Europe for the rapid conversion of recent (seven days or less) onset AF to sinus rhythm. Cl inically, vernakalant has been shown to be effective in restoring sinus rhythm in patients with AF episodes lasting between 3 hours and 7 days 4 with a low proarrhythmic risk. This compound has been shown to be less efficacious in patients with congestive heart failure5. However to date, no results have been reported on patients with seve re heart failure in whom cardiac remodeling could predispose to altered drug efficacy or adverse side effects. Dronedarone is another new agent for the management of AF with composite acti ons at multiple ion channels. Although this compound may have an improved safety profile compared to amiodarone, it is less efficacious in reducing AF recurrence rates 6. AZD1305 ( Figure 1A ) is an investigational compound that has been under development for the management of persistent AF. Although AZD1305 predominantly blocks I Kr, it also has major inhibitory effects on I CaL and I Na (predominantly I NaLate) and minor effects on other K+ currents 7, 8. In the normal canine heart, this compound exerts atrial -predominant electrophysiological effects, both in vivo and in vitro 9. In the anesthetized methoxam ine-sensitized rabbit model of torsades de extrasystoles or TdP 7. Beat-to- b e a t v a r i a b i l i t y o f r e p o l a r i z a t i o n d u r a t i o n ( B V R o f t h e Q T i n t e r v a l ) a l s o r e m a i n e d unaltered. In contrast, the selective I Kr blocker dofetilide prolonged the QT interval, increased BVR and induced TdP in the majority of animals tested 7. AZD1305 has been shown to depress excitability and supp ress delayed-afterdep olarization-induced triggered activity in canine pulmonary-vein sleeve preparations 10. Recent clinical 159 CHAPTER 6 data suggest that this compound has electrophysiological effects that may translate in to a n tia r r h yth m ic e f f ic a c y in A F pa ti ents and may have a reduced proarrhythmic potential as compared to selective I Kr blockers 11, 12. In the present study, we inve stigated the electrophysiolog ical effects of AZD1305 in anesthetized dogs with remodeled hearts, wi th our hypothesis being that due to the composite ion-channel blockade by AZD1305, less ventricular proarrhythmia will be seen when compared to I Kr blockade alone, despite leading to equivalent r e p o l a r i z a t i o n p r o l o n g a t i o n . T o t h i s a i m , w e u s e d t h e d o g w i t h c h r o n i c c o m p l e t e atrioventricular block (AVB), a sensit ive model to examine the proarrhythmic potential of new chemical entities. After the induction of AVB, the heart undergoes electrical and structural remodeli ng, creating a substrate for TdP 13, 14. We analyzed ventricular and atrial repolarization pa rameters and compared the effects of AZD1305 with those of the selective I Kr blocker dofetilide ( Figure 1A ), which exerts torsadogenic actions in this animal model. 6.2 Materials and Methods 6.2.1 General Animal handling was in accordance with the Dutch Law on Animal Experimentation and the European Directive for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental and Other Sc ientific Purposes, Europe an Community Directive 86/609/CEE, and under the regulations of th e Committee for Experiments on Animals of Maastricht University, The Netherlands. Fourteen adult mongrel dogs (10 female and 4 male; body weight 20.1\u00b10.8 kg; Marshall BioResources, NY, USA) were includ ed in these experiments. After overnight fasting, animals were seda ted with 0.5 mg/kg methadone, 0.5 mg/kg acepromazine, and 0.5 mg atropine was induced with sodium pentobarbital 25 intained by isoflurane (0.5% to 1%). After intubation, the dogs were artificially ventilated with a mixture of oxygen and compressed air (2 : 1). Proper animal ca re was taken before, during, and after the experiments, including a thermal mattress to maintain body temperature, fluid administration to prevent volume deplet ion (0.9% NaCl), and administration of antibiotics and analgesics (buprenorphine 0.015 mg/kg intramuscularly). In all experiments, standard lead and pr ecordial ECG registrations were combined with endocardial monophasic action pote ntial (MAP) recordings and continuously stored. MAPs (Hugo Sachs Elektronik, Germany) were recorded from left ventricular (LV), right ventricular (RV) and right atrial (RA) endocardial site s. MAP signals were 160 AZD1305 IN THE REMODELED DOG HEART accepted on the basis of amplitude, morp hology and stability. MAP catheters were kept in the same position during drug infusions. 6.2.2 Experimental Design The experimental protocol is shown in Figure 1B . AZD1305 was dissolved in an equimolar amount of 0.1 mol/L tartaric acid and then diluted in 0.9% saline. AZD1305 was infused at a rate of 36 g/kg/min for a total of 30 min >1 week before creating AVB to investigate the effects of this compound in the normal unremodeled heart with sinus rhythm, and in acute and chronic AVB. AVB was induced by radiofrequency catheter ablation of th e His bundle as previously described 15. Dofetilide was dissolved in 0. 9% saline and intravenously administered at a dose of 12.5 g/kg/5 min to test for TdP inducibility 2-3 weeks after inducing AVB (chronic AVB) in all dogs. Three animals developed in tractable ventricular fibrillation during TdP. TdP, a bolus (870 g/kg) of the compound was administered after the first episode of TdP in 4 dogs ( Figure 1B ). In 4 animals 12.5 g/kg/5 min dofetilide was also infused >1 week before AVB was created so a comparis on of atrial effects of this compound could be made pre and post remode ling, and compared with AZD1305. In a total of 11 chronic-AVB dogs, AZD1305 (36 g / k g / m i n f o r 3 0 m i n ) w a s administered at 3\u00b11 weeks after the induct ion of AVB (chronic AVB) to examine its electropharmacological effects in the remo deled heart. In 4 of these experiments, after the AZD1305 infusion, a dofetilide challenge was reapplied to investigate preventive ( Figure 1B ). When TdP did not stop spontaneously within 10 to 20 seconds or when the arrhythmia deteriorated in to ventricular fibrillation , the dog was electrically cardioverted. If TdP recurred in a period longer than 10 minutes magnesium sulphate (100 mg/kg for 2 min) was used to restore a regular rhythm. After sacrifice, hearts were excised an d weighed (n=11 dogs with chronic AVB). Average heart weights were 217\u00b111 g. Heart-weight to body-weight ratios averaged 10.5\u00b10.2 g/kg, similar to previous studies on chronic AVB and significantly higher than unremodeled dog hearts 13, 14, 15. 161 CHAPTER 6 Figure 1: A. Chemical structures of the combined ion-channel blocker AZD1305 and the pure I Kr blocker dofetilide. B. Experimental protocol. 6.2.3 Plasma Analysis of AZD1305 Venous blood samples were obtained at ba seline and then at 5, 10, 15, 30, 35, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 150 min after start of AZD 1305 infusion. Samples were collected in K2-EDTA tubes, centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm at 4\u00b0C and the plasma stored at \u00ed\u001b\u0013\u00b0C. The plasma concentration of AZD1305 was determined by on-line solid-phase extraction followed by tandem mass spec trometric detection. The lower limit of TXDQWLILFDWLRQ\u0003ZDV\u0003\u0013\u0011\u0013\u0014\u0018\u0013\u0003PRO\u0012/\u0011 6.2.4 Data Analysis RR, QRS, QT, PP and PR intervals in ECG le ad II, LV and RV MAP duration (LV and RV MAPD) at 90% repolarization repolarization were measured computer program (IDEEQ, IDEE, Maastricht University). QT intervals were corrected for heart rate changes according to Van de Wate r et al. (QTcV=QT-0.087(RR-1000)) 16. Most data were averaged from 30 consec utive beats measured at -5 and 0 min (baseline) and at 5, 10, 15, 30, 35, 45 and 60 min after start of AZD1305 or dofetilide infusion. If extrasystolic activity was seen, parameters were measured before the first extrasystole. Beat-to-beat variability of re ters were compared using (repeated-measures) ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's test. Data are reported as mean\u00b1SEM. Countables, such as TdP episode numbers, were tested with a Mann-Whitney rank sum test and are reported as median (interquartile range). Differences were considered statistically significant if P<0.05. 6.3 Results 6.3.1 Concentration-Dependent Prolongation of Ventricular Repolarization by AZD1305 in the Normal Dog Heart In 14 normal anesthetized dogs, intravenou s administration of AZD1305 resulted in a maximal plasma concentration of 1.57\u00b10.05 mol/L at 30 min ( Figure 2 ). The QT and QTcV interval increased from 290\u00b17 ms and 324\u00b16 ms at baseline to 397\u00b115 ms and 417\u00b114 ms at 30 min AZD1305, respectively (+37% and +29%, P<0.0001), along with an increase in the RR interval ( Figure 2 and Table 1 ). Repolarization prolonged in a concentration-dependent ma nner, with MAPD90 increasing more in the LV than in the RV (+48% versus +39%; Figure 2 ). LV and RV BVR did not change significantly. P-wave duration and the QRS interval were slightly but significantly increased by AZD1305 ( Table 1 ). The compound did not induce ventricular or atrial arrhythmias in these normal hearts. After stopping infusion, AZD1305 plasma levels rapidly declined, reaching 0.57\u00b10.05 mol/L 30 min later. 163 CHAPTER 6 Figure 2: Rate-Dependent Repolarization Effect s of AZD1305 in the Normal, Acutely- Overloaded and Chronically-Remodeled Dog He art. Changes in QT interval, LV and RV MAPD90, and RR interval in relation to plasma concentration of AZD1305 (36 g/kg/min intravenously for 30 min) in the normal canine heart with sinus rhythm. In 6 dogs, steady-state pacing was applied at a cycle length (CL) of 500 ms in the normal heart (right-atrial pacing), an d at 500 ms and 1000 ms just after AVB induction and at chronic AVB (RV-apex pacing). Figure 3 illustrates the rate- dependent effects of AZD1305 (versus ba seline) on LV MAPD90. Effects during pacing are plotted next to those during si nus or idioventricular rhythm. At a pacing CL of 500 ms, AZD1305 led to a 20% increase of LV MAPD90 in the normal heart, 30% increase at acute AVB and 37% prol ongation at chronic AVB at 3 weeks. Reverse use-dependent prolongation of LV and RV MAPD90 was most accentuated in the remodeled heart at chronic AVB. 164 AZD1305 IN THE REMODELED DOG HEART Figure 3: Rate-dependent repolarization effects of AZD1305 at normal sinus rhythm, acute and chronic AVB.

Plasma concentrations at all time points were not significantly different compared to those seen in sinus rhythm. The QT and QTcV interval increased from 535\u00b128 ms and 444\u00b130 ms at baseline to 747\u00b136 ms and 634\u00b135 ms at 30 min AZD1305, respective ly (+40% and +43%, P<0.0001; Table 1). A slowing of the idio ventricular rate was noted ( Table 1 ). The was prolonged the unaltered (2.8 \u00b10.3 versus 3.7\u00b10.3 ms, P=0.20). Similar results were obtained for the RV repolarization variables.

Figure 7 illustrates how both LVMAPD90 and BVR were altered in two chronic AVB animals after either AZD1305 or dofetilide infusion. Dofetilide caused a progressive and parallel increase in LVMAPD90 and BVR promoting extrasystolic activity and TdP. In contrast, AZD1305 infusion did not increa se BVR despite significantly prolonging MAPD90 (see also Table 1 ). Whereas dofetilide caused TdP in all dogs, this occurred in only 4 out of 11 dogs after AZD1305 (P =0.0007 versus dofetilide). Furthermore, dofetilide-induced TdP episodes occurred mo re frequently, lasted longer and required electrical cardioversion more often. The cycle lengths of AZD1305- versus dofetilide- induced TdP were similar (311\u00b118 ms vers us 286\u00b17 ms, respectively, P=0.10). 169 CHAPTER 6 Figure 7: Panel (1), baseline.

Under these conditions, first extrasystolic activity was postponed, occurring at 13\u00b12.2 min after the start of dofetilide infusion (versus 3.8\u00b10.2 after dofetilide 002). prolonged baseline to 644\u00b140 ms during AZD1305 (P=0.002 versus baseline) to 684\u00b149 AZD1305 (P=0.02 versus AZD1305). In 2/4 animals, no TdP was seen at all, despit e previous TdP susceptibility to dofetilide alone. In the other two animals, dofetilid e after AZD1305 caused significantly fewer TdPs than during its solo administrati on: 1 (0-2) versus 7 (3-11) episodes, respectively an alternative regimen ( Figure 1B ), AZD1305 was administered as a fast infusion (870 g/kg) after the first dofetilide-induced TdP (n=4). Under these conditions, the number of TdP episodes was decreased (2 (1-3) versus 7 (3-11); P=0.05) compared to dofetilide alone. 6.3.4 Atrial Effects of AZD1305 in the Normal and Remodeled Dog Heart The atrial effects of AZD1305 are illustrated in Figure 9 .

After chronic AVB, baseline right-atrial MAPD50, MAPD90 and PP intervals were similar as during sinus rhythm and atri al repolarization and PP CL was still significantly prolon 9 ). For example, right-atrial MAPD90 was ms at baseline versus 270\u00b1 17 ms (P=0.03, +21%) at the end of AZD1305 infusion. Interestingly, even af ter remodeling dofetilide still led to significantly prolonged atrial repolarization ( Figure 10 ). 172 AZD1305 IN THE REMODELED DOG HEART Figure 9: Atrial effects of AZD1305 in the normal and remodeled canine heart.

Chemically, dofetilide is a methanesulphonamide derivative and thus a member of the same family of specific I Kr-blocking antiarrhythmic agents such as ibutilide and d-sotalol (Figure 1A ). AZD1305, on the other hand, is a disubstituted 9 oxabispidine compound structurally relate d to its congener AZD7009 ( Figure 1A ). Interestingly, the minor structural differences in AZD1305 vs AZD7009 introduce potent I CaL-activity to the I Kr and I Na-blocking characteristics described for both agents 7, 8, 17. Hence, with its combined ion channel-bl ocking profile, AZD1305 has been proposed as an antiarrhythmic agent against AF wi th a lower proarrhythmic potential than other antiarrhythmic drugs. AZ D1305 has been demonstrated to cause atrial-predominant effects in the health y dog heart and attenuates ventricular repolarization-related instability caused by su dden rate changes during selective IKr blockade 8. In fact, AZD1305 was devoid of proarrhythmia in anesthetized methoxamine-sensitized rabbit s, whereas other selective I Kr blockers proved very torsadogenic in this animal model 7, 18. In our experiments on anesthetized do gs with normal hearts, AZD1305 caused ventricular and atrial repolari zation prolongation, but no re polarization instability or proarrhythmias. In chronic-AVB dogs with remodeled hearts and a high susceptibility to acquired TdP, AZD1305 was much less proarrhythmic than dofetilide, despite causing ventricular repolarization prolongation . arose early duri ng the 30-min infusion phase, when the plasma concentrations were still ri sing. At 10 min, the AZD1305 plasma concentration av eraged 1.3\u00b10.3 mol/L (n=6 dogs with chronic AVB; Figure 4 ). In vitro findings indicate that AZD1305 has a higher potency against hERG (IC50 0.4 mol/L) in this concentrat ion range than against I CaL and hNav1.5 (IC50s of 1.2 and 1.5 mol/L, respectively) 7. Although these in vitro find ings can only be used with caution to predict potential e ffects in vivo, we speculate that the surge of ventricular extrasystoles and TdP during early AZD1305 in fusion was due to initial proarrhythmic IKr inhibition, followed by antiarrhythmic I CaL and I Na suppression upon mounting levels of the compound. Inhibition of either I Na or I CaL has previously been shown to be effective in suppressing I Kr-block-induced TdP in variou s experimental models. For example, I Na block by lidocaine attenuated the incidence of TdP by almokalant in rabbits without influencing the almo kalant-induced QT prolongation 19. Similar effects have been shown in the chronic-AVB dog aft er dofetilide-induced TdP, both with lidocaine and the novel I NaLate blocker ranolazine 20, although in the latter study multiple ventricular ectopic be ats were not completely abol ished. In the same animal model, Oros et al. 21 showed a robust antiarrhythmic effect of both flunarizine and verapamil against dofetilide-induced TdP. To our knowledge, AZD1305 is the first compound, with the exception of amiodaro ne and dronedarone, with effects on I Kr 175 CHAPTER 6 together with ancillary dual I Na and I CaL-blocking effects that ha s been investigated in this proarrhythmic model, and our results suggest that compounds with this profile could be devoid of proarrhythmic side effects if the ion-channel-blocking potencies are balanced (more so than for AZD1305), leaving I Kr block unattended. 6.4.1 Repolarization Lability and Proarrhythmia Liability Various research groups have investigated the value of BVR parameters to predict imminent arrhythmia under conditions of re polarization lability. In the chronic-AVB dog, increases of beat-to-beat variability of MAPD have been shown to predict drug-induced TdP 22, 23. Compounds increasing MAPD per se, but not BVR, are generally not torsadogenic in this experimental mo del. Beat-to-beat variability of the QT interval has also proven useful in he ralding arrhythmia in other TdP models 7, 24, 25. In the clinical setting, increased BVR of the QT interval characterized patients with drug-induced proarrhythmia, even in the absence of QTc prolongation 26. Likewise, this parameter identified latent repolarization disorders in patients with congenital long QT syndrome 27. BVR of the QT interval was also found to be increased in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure, probably reflecting acquired repolarization disturbances and an increa sed susceptibility to sudden arrhythmic death 28. In the present study, we have demonstrated that the combined inhibition of ICaL and I Na together with I Kr blockade does not significantl y increase BVR in dogs with chronic AVB despite causin g marked repolarization prolongation. These data r e i n f o r c e t h e n o t i o n t h a t B V R i s a r o b u s t p r e d i c t o r o f T d P , m o r e s o t h a n repolarization duration pe r se, at least under these experimental conditions. 6.4.2 Atrial Effects of AZD1305 in the Remodeled Heart AZD1305 has been shown to be an effective antiarrhythmic agent in various animal models of AF 9, 10. It causes an atrial-predominant blockade of I Na (particularly tonic inhibition) which is suggested to transl ate into high antiarrhythmic efficacy 9. Previously, the predecessor to AZD1305, AZD7009, was shown to restore sinus rhythm in up to 82% of patients with AF episodes lasting up to 30 days and with minimal proarrhythmic side effects 29, 30. AZD7009 was less effective in patients with AF durations exceeding 1 month. A recent clinical study showed that AZD1305 was effective in converting AF to SR, with a conversion rate of 50% within 90 min in the highest dose group, despite AF episode durations of up to 3 months 12. In the present study, AZD1305 led to signif icant increases in right-atrial MAPD50 and MAPD90 in both the normal and the AVB-remodeled dog heart ( Figure 9 ). The mechanisms and consequences of atrial remodeling during chronic AVB are still incompletely understood. In an early stud y in dogs, right-atrial pressures were increased during acute and chronic overload 31, thus promoting dilatation and hypertrophy. In goats, progressive atrial dilatation has been demonstrated in chronic 176 AZD1305 IN THE REMODELED DOG HEART AVB, along with atrial prolon gation of and local delays 32. Importantly, atria undergoing remodeling due to electrically- induced AF were less responsive to I Kr blockers given as solo administration 33. The additional blockade of I Kur, I TO and I KAch, which prolonged the early atrial repolarization, led to restoration of the antiarrhythmic class-III action of the I Kr blocker in this goat model 33. In other dog models, the myocardial substrate of AF in congestive heart failure appeared very di fferent from that of rapid-atrial-pacing related AF, 34 with contrasting efficacy of dofetilide 35. Collectively, these data illustrate the impact of th e type of remodeling on atrial drug responsiveness. 6.4.3 Conclusions Despite causing a similar degree of repola rization delay, the combined ion-channel blocker AZD1305 induces less ventricular repolarization in stability, reflected in LV BVR, and has a lower proarrhythmi c potential than the selective I Kr blocker dofetilide in the chronic AVB-remodele d dog heart. AZD1305 can st ill lead to TdP in the remodeled heart, although in a minority of animals, during an infusion phase when plasma levels of the compound are still incr easing. This is likely due to differential affinities of the drug for various ion channe ls, resulting in a window of preferential proarrhythmic I Kr block. Further development of sa fer combined ion-channel blockers as antiarrhythmics could take th is information into account. 6.5 Acknowledgements The authors wish to Roel L.H.M.G.

Ho wever, the use of this indirect marker often leads to misinterpretation of the re alistic TdP risk, as tested compounds may cause QT prolongation without effectively evoking TdP in man. A negative electro-mechanical (E-M) window has recently been proposed as an alte rnative risk marker for TdP in a canine LQT1 model. The cu rrent work studied the E-M window in anaesthetized guinea-pigs as a screening marker for TdP in man. The effects of various reference drugs and changes in bo dy temperature on the E-M window were assessed in instrumented guinea-pigs. The E-M window was defined as the delay between the duration of the electrical (QT interval) and mechanical (QLVP end) systole. the E-M window, whereas compounds with no TdP risk in man (salbutamol and diltiazem) failed to affect the E-M window. Interestingly, drugs with documented clinical QT prolongation, but with low risk for TdP (ami odarone, moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin) did not decrease window. Furthe rmore, the E-M window was minimally affected by changes in heart rate or body temperature. In conclusion a decreased E-M window was consistently observed wi th drugs documented to have high TdP risk, but not with drugs with low or no Td P risk. These results suggest that the E-M window in anaesthetized guinea-pigs is a risk marker for TdP in man. 184 ELECTRO -MECHANICAL WINDOW IN GUINEA PIGS 7.1 Introduction Delayed ventricular repo larization - whether by congenital defects such as the long QT syndrome (LQTS) 1 or by the effects of potassium channels blocking drugs such as terfenadine or dofetilide - is associat ed with a high incidence of Torsades de Pointes (TdP) and sudden cardiac death. The incidence of TdP with cardiac pro- arrhythmic drugs is 1-8 % while the incidenc e with non-cardiac dr ugs is considerably lower (approximately 1 in 100 000) 2. Because of its infrequent occurrence TdP is typically not seen in clinical trials. As such, QT interval prolongation has become a surrogate marker of TdP risk and is commo nly used as a preclinical and clinical biomarker for pro-arrhythmic activity of non-cardiovascular drugs 3. Currently QT prolongation is a major safety issue in drug development and a dedicated regulatory guideline (ICH S7B) de scribes strategies for identification of drug candidates affecting cardiac repolari zation. Since no single assay is sufficient to predict the risk of TdP in humans, the ICH S7B document recommends an integrated approach including at least an in vitro assessment of inhibition of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (I Kr) and an in vivo QT-assay. In line with the ICH S7B guideline, frontloading of cardiovascular safety data, i.e. screening for TdP liability ea rly on in drug development has become common practice. In this view, guinea-pigs have received a great deal of attention with regards to evaluation of effects of newly discovered drugs on the QT interval at the early stage. Indeed, the anesthetized guinea-pig model is a useful tool for \"first in line\" in vivo cardio vascular safety assessment due to the limited amounts of test compound required; the similarity of cardiac ionic currents between guinea-pigs and man 4, and the ease of manipulation of guinea-pigs. Over the last years many reference drugs have been evaluated in the anaesthetized guinea-pig model and the predictive value of this model for QT prolonga tion in humans is well documented 5, 6, 7. Although the current strategies based on identification of drug-induced QT prolongation in animal models (ICH S7B) and its clinical counterpart - the thorough QT study (ICH E14) - have been relatively successful in the attrition of unsafe drug candidates, this approach inhe rently generates a number of false positive results due to the lack of direct association between the surrogate marker (QT interval) and the final endpoint (TdP risk). Indeed, the magnitude of QTc prolongation does not correlate with the TdP risk in man; and several drugs prolong the QT interval without causing TdP in man 2, 8, 9. 185 CHAPTER 7 Over the last years a number of new risk markers and models for TdP risk evaluation have been proposed, illustrating the absolute need of the pharmaceutical industry to develop more accurate marker s for TdP risk in man. The cu rrent state-of-the-art of risk markers and pro-arrhythmia models are comprehensively described elsewhere 8, 10, 11. The electro-mechanical (E-M) wind ow has recently been proposed as one of these alternative risk markers for TdP in man. The current work aimed to evaluate the E- M window in anaesthetized guinea-pigs as a new risk marker for TdP. The E-M window is defined as the delay between the electrical (QT-interval) and mechanical (QLVP end) systole (E-M window = QLVP end interval - QT interval, Figure 1 ). Despite intensiv e studies on E-M coupling in man since the 1980's, the concept of disturbed E- M coupling as a risk marker for TdP was only recently introduced in safety pharmacology 12. In healthy individuals, the duration of the electrical systole (QT interval) is shorter than, but closely parallels the duration of mechanical systole (measured indirectly by the time between the Q wave and the second heart sound; QS2) throug hout the normal range of resting heart rates 13. Interestingly, changes in autonomic tone 14 or high circulating catecholamine levels 15 were reported to invert the normal QT/QS2 ratio. Furthermore, the QT/QS2 ratio was found to be a useful indicato r for several cardiovascular diseases 16, 17, 18. Moreover, patients with the Romano-Ward inherited long QT syndrome were found to have an altered QT/QS2 ratio 19. Recently, van der Linde et al. (2010) 12 showed that in a canine LQT1 dog model an inverted (negative) E-M window is a prerequisite for the initiation of TdP. A negative E-M window is a highly pro-arrhythmic condition, due to the fact that under these conditions there is a mismatch of electrical and mechanical activity. This provides a situ ation where arrhythmias can ensue, most likely because Ca 2+ can continue to enter the cardiac myocytes favoring the occurrence of Ca2+ overload, leading to both early and delayed afterdepolarizations as well as aftercontractions which may eventu ally lead induction of TdP by I Ks blockade in FRPELQDWLRQ\u0003ZLWK\u0003$5 stimulation 12. Based on these observations we hypothesized that a negative E-M window in the anaesthetized guinea-pig model might be a (LQT1) risk marker of TdP in man. Implementation of such a new risk marker for TdP in an early screening platform, like the anaesthetized guinea -pig model, would mean a si gnificant breakthrough in cardiovascular safety pharmacology. In an attempt to document the predictive value of the E-M window in anaesthetized guinea-pigs the effects of various pharmacological agents with different tors adogenic profiles (high, low and no TdP risk) were assessed. 186 ELECTRO -MECHANICAL WINDOW IN GUINEA PIGS Figure 1: The Wiggers diagram illustrates the sy nchronization of the electrical (electrocardiogram, ECG) and mechanical (left ventricular pressure, LVP) activity of the cardiac muscle in anaest hetized guinea-pigs. The electro-mechanical window (E-M window) is defined as the delay between the duration of the electrical (QT interval) and mechanical (QLVP end interval) systole. E-M window = QLVP end interval - QT interval. 7.2 Methods 7.2.1 Animal Use and Care The studies were approved by the Ethica l Committee of Vito (Mol, Belgium) and conformed to the Guide for the Care and Us e of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institute of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996). Female Dunkin Hartley guin ea-pigs (weight 380-540 g) we re purchased from Charles Rivers (L'Arbresle, France). Animals arrived at the animal facilities at least 1 week before the study and were housed in gr oups (up to 5 animals per cage; >3500 cm\u00b2 per cage) with access to food and water ad libitum. 7.2.2 Surgical Procedure Animals were anaesthetized by intraperitonea l administration of sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg). A tracheotomy was performed and the guinea-pigs were mechanically ventilated with room air (model '683' respir ator, Harvard Apparatus, Les Ulis, France) using a stroke volume of 10 ml/kg at a rate of 60 strokes/min. The tracheal tube was connected to a pressure transducer to monitor the pulmonary inflation pressure throughout the experiment. Animals were pl aced on an electrical heat pad at 37\u00b0C 187 CHAPTER 7 (small operating table, Harvard Apparatus) . Both jugular veins were cannulated for respectively intravenous drug administration (right ju gular vein) and continuous infusion of pentobarbital (6 mg/h) to main tain anaesthesia (left jugular vein). An open-lumen catheter was inserted in the left carotid artery for blood pressure measurement and collection of arterial bloo d samples. A tip catheter (SPR-249, Millar Instruments, Houston, Texas, USA) was positioned in the left ventricle for measurement of left ventricular pressure (accessed via the right carotid artery). Four needle electrodes were put subcutaneously to record the electrocardiogram (ECG). Pressure and ECG signals were relayed to a bio-amplifier (EMKA Technologies, Paris, France) with output to a data acquisition system (IOX, EMKA Technologies). Raw data were captured at sampling rates of 1000 Hz (ECG signals) or 500 Hz (blood pressure and left ventricular pressure). After being instrumented animals were allowed to stabilize for a period of at least 20 min. 7.2.3 Experimental Protocol The effect of various reference drugs on cardio-electrophysiological and cardio-hemodynamic parameters was assessed in anaesthetized guinea -pigs. Guinea-pigs received consecutively five increasing doses of the test compounds. All compounds were infused intravenously at a rate of 1 ml /kg over a 10-min infusion period with 5- min intervals between consecutive doses. An imals in the separate vehicle group were infused equal volumes of salin e. At the end of the vehicle experiments dofetilide was infused over a 1-min period as positive control. In addition, a separate set of experiments (n=3) were performed to assess the effect of temperature (range 38\u00b0C-34\u00b0C) on the cardiovascular parameters. After stabilization the heating pad was switched-off and temperature (measured via a rectal probe) and associated cardiovascul ar parameters were monitored during the cooling phase. 7.2.4 Data Analysis Analysis of raw data was performed using ECG-Auto software (v ersion 2.5.1, EMKA Technologies). ECG signals (lead II) were automatically analyzed based on shape-recognition linked to a user-defined library of ECG waveforms. The QTcB interval was calculated for every single be at by using the previous RR interval. The end of the ventricular relaxation (LVP end point) was defined by applying a threshold (-100 mmHg/s) on the first derivative of the relaxation part of the LVP signal. The RR interval, PQ interval, QRS interval , QT interval, QTcB interval, QLVP end interval and the E-M window were calculated beat by beat. The accuracy of the analysis was reviewed by manual over-reading. For each minute-interval, median values were calculated and used for reporting. 188 ELECTRO -MECHANICAL WINDOW IN GUINEA PIGS The QT interval, the QLVP end interval and the E-M window were reported in actual units (ms), whereas for QTcB the change s from baseline in percentage were calculated. The parameters 60 seconds prior to the first drug administration were defined as baseline values. (t = 0 min). The results from individual animals were pooled by treatment group and visualized in graphs as mean\u00b1. 7.2.5 Chemicals Clinical reference substances were purchase as dry powd er. Quinidine, haloperidol, domperidone, terfenadine were purchased from Si gma (Bornem, Belgium). The dry powder (taking into account a correction factor for the different molecular weights of various salt forms) was dissolved in a vehicle cons isting of physiological saline solution. Vehicles of terfenadine and domperidone 10 % hydroxypropyl- - cyclodextrin to increase solubility. Amiodaro ne was purchased in a clinically available formulation (Cordarone\u00ae 150 mg per 3 ml, Sanofi Aventis) and was diluted with saline. 7.2.6 Statistics Results were expressed as me an\u00b1SEM. Changes from baseline (in actual units) were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA test with Bonferroni post-hoc test. 7.3 to instrumented and anaesthetized Following drug administrati on the duration of the QT interval and the QLVP end interval was continuously monitored. In addition, the E-M window, defined as the delay between the electrical and mechanical systole (E-M window = QLVP end interval - QT interval) was calculated beat by beat ( Figure 1 ). 7.3.1 Drugs with Well-Documented TdP Risk Drugs associated with prolongation of the QT interval and with well-documented TdP all showed dose- dependent prolongation of th e QT and QTcB interval ( Figure 2 and Figure 3 ). The QLVP end interval was not prolonged to the same extent as the QT interval resulting in a dose-dependent decrease of the E-M window. Administration of quinidine, haloperidol and domperidone eventually lead to a negative E-M window ( Figure 3 ), whereas terfenadine and thioridazine decreased the E-M window, but failed to make 189 CHAPTER 7 this parameter negative ( Table 1 ). Interestingly, quinidine decreased the E-M window, but a slight restoration of the E-M window between consecutive doses was observed, which was not observ ed for the QTcB interval. Terfenadine caused marked bradycardia and hypotension at the highest dose (10 mg/kg) thereby generating less reliable results at this dose. 7.3.2 Negative Controls (No TdP Risk) Intravenous administration of vehicle (salin e, n=4) did not affect the E-M window or the QTcB interval ( Figure 2 and Figure 4 ). Administration of the positive control (dofetilide) caused a negative E-M window and prolongation of the QTcB interval, illustrating the validity of the assay. In ad dition, two clinical drugs with no TdP risk were tested: salbutamol (n=5) and diltiazem (n=4). Both drugs failed to affect the E-M window. Salbutamol caused a drastic in crease in heart rate (data not shown) thereby significantly decreasing the QT and QLVP end interval. The QTcB interval was shortened by salbutamol illustrating the limitations of Bazett's formula for heart rate correction, whereas the E-M window was hardly influenced by the strong changes in heart rate. Diltiazem caused a decrease of heart rate (data not shown) and eventually cardiovascular co llapse at 3 mg/kg and animals died at the highest dose 10 mg kg -1. However, the E-M window was not altered results ( Figure 2 and Figure 5 ). Both drugs caused a significant prolongation of the QTcB interval of respectively 12 % and 14 %. However, since the QLVP end interval prolonged to the same (moxifloxacin) or higher (amiodaron e) extent no negative E-M window was observed after administration of these comp ounds. Furthermore, do fetilide failed to evoke a negative E-M window following am iodarone administration. Ciprofloxacin (n=4) showed a tendency for QT prolongati on (5 % increase) at the highest dose, but the E-M window was not affected by ciprofloxacin administration. 7.3.4 Isoprenaline Isoprenaline (n=4) showed a shortening in the QT interval, as would be expected due to the chronotopic effects of this compound. At the same time a decrease of the QLVP end interval was observed, which was no t completely synchronized with the effects on QT. This led to a transient decrease in the E-M window at the highest concentrations ( Figure 2 and Figure 4 ). 190 ELECTRO -MECHANICAL WINDOW IN GUINEA PIGS Figure 2: Graphs show the effect of various pharmacological agents on the electro- mechanical coupling in anaesthetized guinea-p enadine, of the QT interval versus the QLVP endinterval, whereas drugs with low risk (amiodarone, with no TdP ri sk (vehicle, salbutamol and diltiazem) induced parallel changes of the QT interval and LVP end interval. Finally, isoprena line showed different kinetics of its effect on the QT and QLVP end interval leading to a tran sient decrease of the E-M window. Plots show mean\u00b1SEM. 191 CHAPTER 7 Figure 3: Graphs show the effects of drugs with documented TdP risk on the commonly used surrogate marker for TdP risk (QTcB, % ch ange from baseline; le ft panels) and panels co nsistently decreased the E-M window. Graphs show mean\u00b1SEM. 192 ELECTRO -MECHANICAL WINDOW IN GUINEA PIGS Figure 4: Plots show the effects of vehicle, of drugs with no TdP risk (diltiazem, salbutamol), of isoprenaline and of changes in body temperature (lowest graphs) on the commonly used surrogate marker for TdP risk (QTcB, % change from baseline; left panels) and on the E-M window (ms; right panels). The vehicle did not ca use QTcB prolongation or shortening of the E-M window. Salbutamol and diltiazem, resp ectively, increased and decreased heart rate (data not shown), but did not affect the E-M window. Isoprenaline transiently reduced the E-M window due to the different kinetics of its effect on the QT and QLVP end interval. Finally, cooling of anaesthetized animals from 38\u00b0C to 34\u00b0C prolonged the QTcB interval \u00ed\u0014\u0017\u0011\u0019\u0003PV\u0083&\u00ed\u0014), but had no major effect on the duration of the E-M window. Graphs show mean\u00b1SEM. 193 CHAPTER 7 Figure 5: Graphs show the effects of amiodarone and two antibiotics (moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin) on the commonly used surrogat e marker for TdP risk (QTcB, % change from baseline; left panels) and on the E-M window (ms; right panels). Amiodarone increased the QTcB interval, but did not decrease the E-M wind ow; in fact, it significantly increased the E-M window and prevented induction of a negative E-M window by dofetilide. Moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin hardly affected the E-M window despite prolongation of the QTcB interval. Graphs show mean\u00b1SEM. 7.3.5 Effect of Temperature The effect of temperature on the electro- mechanical coupling was investigated in a different set of experiments (n=3, Figure 4 ). Cooling of the animals from 38\u00b0C to 34\u00b0C caused increases of the QT interv QTcB interval (slope: -14.6 PV\u00b0C-1) and the QLVP end interval. The E-M window remained stable during cooling; and even slightly increased when cooling below 35.5\u00b0C. 194 ELECTRO -MECHANICAL WINDOW IN GUINEA PIGS Table 1 Change from baseline (ms) baseline dose 1 dose 2 dose 3 dose 4 dose 5 (actual units) 10 min 25 min 40 min 55 min 70 min r10.5 Table 1: Baseline values (actual un its) and change from base line for the E-M window and the QTcB interval after administration of various clinical reference drugs.

A one-way ANOVA with Bonferoni post-hoc test was performed on the baseline' values, * P<0.05, ** P<0.01, *** P<0.001. 7.3.6 Occurrence of Arrhythmias None of the reference drugs evoked episodes of TdP. Isolated ventricular premature contractions (VPCs) and an atrial premat ure contraction (APC) were observed in 8 and 1 out of 45 animals respectively. Most of these VPC's were observed during replacement of the catheters and were not observed in later experiments where the catheters were appropriately fixated. Right bundle branch block (r-BBB) was reported after administration of diltiazem (1 of 4), terfen adine (4 of 4), haloperidol (1 of 3), thioridazine (2 of 5) and amiodaro ne (1 of 4). Furtherm ore atrio-ventricular block (AVB) was observed after treatment with diltiazem (3 of 4 animals), terfenadine (1 of 4), haloperidol (1 of 3) and dofetilide (2 of 4). Finally, diltiazem caused complete cardiovascular collapse in all animals (starting from 3 mg/kg) eventually leading to death. 195 CHAPTER 7 7.4 Discussion 7.4.1 The Anaesthetized Guinea-Pig Model and the E-M Window Over the last years the anaesthetized guinea -pig model has received a great deal of attention as a useful tool for early in vivo cardiovascular safety screening. Guinea-pigs have a cardiac electrophysiology th at largely resembles human and the small size of the animals favors the use of this model for cardiovascular safety screening. Several anaesthesia regimens have been described for assessing QT prolongation in guinea-pigs 20, 21, 22 with the pentobarbital anaesthetized model being the most common and best documented 5 ,6, 7, 23. In addition to the ECG-derived information (QT interval, QRS interval and PQ interv al) the anaesthetized guinea-pig model provides information on hemo dynamics (heart rate, blood pressure, QA interval), cardiac performance (left ventricular pressu re) and on the induction of spontaneous arrhythmias making it a versatile cardiovascular screening model ( Figure 6 ). Recently, the E-M window has been proposed as a novel risk marker for TdP in a LQT1 dog model 12. The present work provides the first documented report of the E-M window as a general risk marker fo r TdP within an earl y screening model. Figure 6: Figure shows a schematic overview of the anaesthetized guinea-pig model as a versatile early cardiovascular safety screening tool. At present, both pre-clinical (ICH S7B) and clinical (ICH E14) studies use the QTc interv al as a surrogate marker for TdP risk in man. The E-M window provides a new risk marker for TdP risk in man that might eventually be implemented in clinical research. APC, atrial premature contraction; VPC, ventricular premature contraction; block (left or right). 196 ELECTRO -MECHANICAL WINDOW IN GUINEA PIGS 7.4.2 Drugs with High TdP Risk are Selectively Flagged Drugs with documented high TdP risk 24, 25 consistently decreased the E-M window. Quinidine, domperidone, haloperidol and do fetilide caused a negative E-M window that might form a substrate for the development of TdP. Due to a large repolarization rese rve in guinea-pigs 26, 27 IKr blockade by itself did not elicit TdP in the anaesthetized guinea-pig model. The results of terfenadine an d thioridazine are less cl ear. Despite a substantial decrease of the E-M window, terfenadine and thioridazine did not cause negative E-M windows on their own. This might sugg est that additional challenges on the repolarization reserve are requ ired to trigger TdP with these agents. Terfenadine, for example, has been shown to be a multi-io n channel blocker, a ffecting both inward and outward currents, including the L-type calcium current (I CaL) and the slowly activating delayed rectif ier potassium current (I Kr), which could be an explanation for the absence of a negative E-M window with this compound 28. Interestingly, terfenadine did not trigger TdP in a phenyl ephrine-sensitized ra bbit model, whereas halofantrine and clofilium did lead to TdP 29. In the anaesthetized guinea-pig model a 5 % increase in the QTcB interval can be accurately detected 30 and a 10 % prolongation of the QTcB interval should be classified as important QT prolonga tion. Similarly, based on our current experience we suggest that a shortening of the E-M window below 20 ms warrants further evaluation, whereas a negative E-M window points directly to high TdP risk in man. Drugs with no TdP risk (nor the ve hicle) had no effect on the E-M window demonstrating the selectivity of the new risk marker. 7.4.3 Amiodarone The multi-target agent amiodarone has extremely complex electropharmacological actions, with effects on multiple ion FKDQQHOV\u0003DV\u0003ZHOO\u0003DV\u0003$5V 31, and is an interesting agent in the context of QT prolongation and TdP, despite causing a modest prolongation of the QT interval , it is an effective antiarrhthymic drug with a relatively low potential for TdP. Amiodarone has been found safe in patients who had experienced TdP while taking other drugs 32, 33 and can be used to treat TdP 34, although it has various off target side e ffects which can limit chronic administration in a large cohort of patients. Furtherm ore, amiodarone showed relatively low potential for TdP in the canine chroni c AV-block model, after both chronic 35 and acute dosing 36 and also in the Screenit rabbit model 37. In line with these reports, acute dosing of amiodarone did not elicit a negative E-M window in our experiments. Moreover, amiodarone increased the E-M wi ndow in anaesthetized inversion of the E-M window by dofetilide. A similar protective effect of amiodarone has been described in a settin g of sotalol-induced arrhythmias in dogs 38. 197 CHAPTER 7 The mechanism of this protective effect might be the conservation of a positive E-M window, most likely due to the alterations in Ca2+ handling, although a reduction in heterogeneity of card iac repolarization has been attr ibuted as well Fluoroquinolones antibiotics are all asso ciated with some degree of QT prolongation 40, 41, but the different members of this therapeutic class have different torsadogenic profiles 42. Grepafloxacin (withdrawn from the market in 1999) and sparfloxacin have a high risk for induction of TdP in humans 43, whereas ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin have a low risk for TdP in man. In agreement with the use of moxifloxacin as a positive co ntrol in thorough QT studies 44; and consistent with published pre-clinical data moxiflox acin prolonged the QTcB interval 6, 45 the present study. Despite cons iderably prolonging the QTcB interval, moxifloxacin only caused a minor decrease in the E-M window in anae sthetized guinea-pig suggesting minimal risk for TdP at the maximal dose used in this study (10 mg/kg). In line with these results moxifloxacin (8 mg/kg) did not prod uce episodes of TdP in a canine chronic AV-block model 46. Whether higher doses of moxifl oxacin would further compromise the E-M window is not known, but pharmaco kinetics of moxifloxacin (400 mg, oral administration, once daily) are well-contr olled which could explain why only few cases of moxifloxacin-related TdP have been reported. For ciprofloxacin no effect on the E-M window was observed. This favorable safety outcome in the anaesthetized guinea-pig model is in line wi th the frequent use of ciprofloxacin in clinical practice as a safe antibiotic. Taken together, the E-M window appears to classify drugs with high and low TdP risk correctly and might be a valuable addition to the classical QTc interval screening. 7.4.5 Isoprenaline Isoprenaline transiently reduced the E-M window due to the different kinetics of its effect on the QT and QLVP end interval. The decrease of the E-M window by isoprenaline might explain the torsadogenic ac tivity of isoprenaline in the LQT1 dog model (with compromised I Ks) 12. However, in anaest hetized guinea-pigs combined administration and I Ks-blockers resulting in large nega tive E-M windows (less than -50 ms) - did not result LQ\u0003VSRQWDQHRXV\u0003RU\u0003$5 stimulation (isoprenaline 0.0125 mg/kg) induced TdP (unpublished data). As such, no di rect association between a negative E-M window and initiation of TdP could curr ently be demonstrated in guinea-pigs. However, in the canine LQT1 model the ne cessity of a negative E-M window for the onset of TdP has been demonstrated 12. 198 ELECTRO -MECHANICAL WINDOW IN GUINEA PIGS 7.4.6 Effect of Heart Rate and Body Temperature on the E-M Window The duration of the QT interval is depend ent on several factors including heart rate, autonomic influences 47 and body temperature 48. Different correction formulas have been applied in an attempt to discriminate between heart rate dependent and heart rate independent changes of the QT inte rval. In anaesthetized guinea-pigs the Bazett's formula is frequently applied to correct for heart rate 6, 20, and this correction has been shown to be the mo st effective in this model 22. The shortening of the QTcB interval with salbutamol in the present study, however, illustrates the limitations of Bazett's formula. Interestin gly, the E-M window hardly changed with salbutamol despite drastic increases in hear t rate. Similarly, sign ificant decreases in heart rate associated with diltiazem di d not affect the E-M window either. The effect of temperature on the duration of the QT interval has been studied in detail in anaesthetized dogs 48. A similar temperature dependency of the QT interval was observed in anaestheti zed anaesthetized dogs. However, the E-M window remained remarkably stable during cooling and even tended to increase slightly when cooling below 35.5\u00b0C. Taken together, the E-M window is, in contrast to the QTcB interval, a robust parameter that is minimally a ffected by changes in heart rate or body temperature. 7.4.7 Limitations of the study No bio-analysis of plasma samples was pe rformed, therefore results could not be presented as x-folds of therapeutic concentrations and subsequently no safety margins could be determined. In literature some data on plasma concentrations and QTcB prolongation of reference drugs in anaesthetized guinea-pigs and dogs have been published 6, 24, 45 that could be useful to put our results in perspective. The QTcB prolongations evoked by reference compounds observed in the current study are consistent with these previous reports. 7.4.8 Conclusions The present work studied for the first time the E-M window in anaesthetized guinea-pigs as a general risk marker for Td P in man. A decreased E-M window was consistently observed with drugs with high TdP risk, but not with drugs with low or no TdP risk. Furthermore, the E-M window was found to be a robust marker minimally affected by changes in heart rate or body temperature. These results suggest that the E-M window in anaestheti zed guinea-pigs is an alternative risk marker for TdP in man that complements the traditional QT interval screening. 199 CHAPTER 7 7.5 Acknowledgements The authors wish to thank Hanne Daems for her excellent technical assistance during the execution of the experiments.

Although (documented) episodes of TdP have a high impact for the individual patient, the estimated incidence is as low as 1 per 100,000 per year 1, 2. In 2005, the regulatory document ICH S7B was introduced with guidelines for a non-clinical testing strategy to assess the potential of a test substance to delay ventricular repolarization. These guidelines recommended the us e of an ion-channel screen to investigate the effects of the test substance on the rapid comp onent of the delayed- rectifier potassium channel (I Kr-channel), as well as an in-vivo QT study in animals such as monkey, swine, dog, rabbit, ferret or guinea pig. The data obtained in these studies should then be combined and used to make an in tegrated risk assessment of the possible proarrhythmic capability of a test co mpound. In addition, these guidelines encouraged interested part ies to develop proarrhythmic models and indices of proarrhythmic activity. Although the current preclinical strategy, to gether with its clinical counterpart ICH E14, has been relatively su ccessful in the attrition of unsafe drug candidates, cardiovascular safety remains one of the major reasons for the failure of compounds to reach the market. This is due to the fact that the mechanisms underlying TdP arrhythmia are not yet fully understood and the potential spectrum of side-effects of many drugs, including non-arrhythmic side-e ffects, is still incompletely explored. In addition, in the case of certain drugs po st-marketing problems have occurred. For example, the COX2 inhibitor Vioxx, a non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that was approved by the FDA in May 1999 for a number of indications (including relief of the signs and symptoms of oste oarthritis, management of acute pain in adults, and for the treatment of menstrual symptoms) was voluntarily withdrawn by the manufacturer in 2004 due to safety concerns of an increased risk of cardiovascular events (includi ng heart attack and stroke). The major aim of this thesis was to provide further insights into the mechanisms of TdP arrhythmia. Further unders tanding of such mechanisms should lead to improved methods to distinguish safe medications from those that may lead to TdP and sudden cardiac death, and to improved prediction and prevention of this arrhythmia in the patient. Over the years numerous discussions have taken place to advance the field of cardiac safety pharma cology, with specific focus on reducing TdP risk 3, 4. In this thesis, a number of these issues have been addressed, including the use of proarrhythmia models to identify novel surrogate markers of TdP (e.g., temporal aspects of repolarization prolongation), and the role of myocardial Ca2+ handling in TdP induction. 208 GENERAL DISCUSSION 8.2 and Models for TdP Beat-to-beat variability of repolarization (BVR) has been proposed as a more predictive marker of TdP arrhythmia than repolarization duration alone 5. BVR has previously been shown to be increase d in a number of in-vivo preclinical proarrhythmic models, including the chronic-AV-block (CAVB) dog 6 and the methoxamine-sen sitized rabbit 7. Additionally, increases in BVR have been observed in other experimental studies when anim als were exposed to compounds that are known to cause TdP 8, 9. Increases in BVR have also be en seen in specific patient groups with an augmen ted arrhythmia risk 10, 11. Interestingly, a recent study also showed an increase of BVR in professional football players 12. Although this study does not directly relate these increases to augmented arrhythmia propensity in this group, it is well known that strenuous exer cise training is accompanied by ventricular hypertrophy, and this may be a substrate fo r sudden cardiac death in a small subset of these athletes 13, who could be genetically predisposed. One of the major aims of this thesis was to understand the underlying mechanisms of BVR, as until now these have remained largely elusive. In Chapter 2 we show that isolated canine myocytes can be used to examine the cellular electrophysiological effects of proarrhyth mic compounds by using various techniques that are outlined in this chapter. We then use these techniques in Chapters 3 and 4 to delineate specific mechanisms of BVR, especi ally in the setting of intense -adrenergic UHFSWRU\u0003 $5 stimulation (see section 8.3 ). A recent interesting st udy from Nalos et al. 14 tested various I Kr blockers, with d i f f e r e n t c l i n i c a l p r o a r r h y t h m i c o u t c o m e s i n f i v e t e s t s y s t e m s , r e g a r d i n g c e l l u l a r markers of arrhythmia prediction. In contrast to other published reports 15, they c o n c l u d e t h a t i s o l a t e d m y o c y t e s l a c k t h e specificity to iden tify proarrhythmic compounds. Nalos et al. 14 show that in both remodele d ventricular myocytes from CAVB dogs and in unremodeled rabbit myoc ytes, moxifloxacin, a compound that has a relatively low proarrhythmic risk, can caus e early afterdepolarizations (EADs). As a number of studies have indicated differentia l responses, at least in Purkinje fibres, between dog and rabbit preparations 16, 17 further investigation of these differences at the single myocyte level is warranted. Un fortunately, moxifloxacin has not been previously tested in isolat ed unremodeled canine myoc ytes and it would be of interest to see if moxifloxacin would cause EADs in this test system. These findings illustrate the importance of selecting the in-vitro test model that will have the most reliable translational outcome. Despite the fact that the single canine myocyte may not be ideal for predicting arrhythmia in-vivo, this cell type can be used to provide major mechanistic insights, as has been carried out in this thesis, to aid in developing better arrhythmia prediction algorithms in vivo. 209 CHAPTER 8 The CAVB dog has been used as a model for proarrhythmic screening for a number of years, and as part of the work in this thesis we extend this by investigating the proarrhythmic capabilities of the co mbined ion-channel blocker AZD1305 ( Chapter 6). AZD1305 was in clinical development fo r the termination of persistent atrial fibrillation. Apart from blocking I Kr, this compound also inhibited I NaLate and I CaL and by having this profile it had shown pr omise in a number of preclinical assays 18, 19. For example in the methoxamine-sensitized rabbit model, AZD1305 was devoid of any proarrhythmic actions de spite causing large increase s in repolarization times 18. In our study we show that AZD1305 was mu ch less proarrhythmic than the pure I Kr blocker dofetilide, despite causing similar ventricular repolarization prolongation. When TdP did occur, the arrhythmia(s) aros e early during the 30-min infusion phase, when AZD1305 plasma concentrations were still rising. When no TdP arrhythmias were seen, BVR remained low, further illust rating the superiority of this parameter over QT prolongation alone. The road of clinical development of AZD1305 was unfortunately halted due to the fact that, as in the CAVB dog model, this compound led to TdP in a number of patien ts in a phase II clinical study 20. We believe that if a compound shows more balanced ion-channe l potencies than those of AZD1305 (i.e. similar inhibition of both inward and outward currents), the strategy of blocking these currents with a single agent coul d hold great therapeutic promise against cardiac arrhythmias without leading to Td P arrhythmia. These data highlight the importance of using sensitiv e proarrhythmic models such as the CAVB dog, before commencing costly clinical trials. As the heart is an electrically-driven muscular pump, the link between its electrical and mechanical activity is of vital impo rtance. An unsuspected abnormality in the ventricular contraction pattern of patients with prolonged repolarization due to congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) and an association with syncope and cardiac arrest was demonstrated over 20 years ago 21. However, only recently mechanical factors have been taken into consideration when disc ussing drug-induced arrhythmia 22. Previously, Gallacher et al. 8 elegantly demonstrated that in a canine model of long-QT1 (LQT1) synd rome, left-ventricular (LV) aftercontractions observed preceded of TdP. After that study, van der Linde et al. 23 showed that in anesthetized dogs under baseline conditions the difference between the end of the QT interval and the end of the mechanical activity of the heart (assessed on the LV- pressure signal) was positive, indicating th at the heart was still in systole when the electrical activity had ceased (a posi tive electro-mechanical (E-M) window). Interestingly, under cond itions Ks EORFNDGH\u0003DQG\u0003$5\u0003 stimulation, and prior to TdP arrhythmias in these animals, this relationship was reversed with completion of electrical activity taking substantially longer than the mechanical activity (negative E-M window). Furthermore, prevention of TdP with either the Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil, or the $5\u0003blocker atenolol, led to less negative E-M windows. In addition to these findings the disconnect between changes in the QT interval and the LV-pressure signal were illustrated when either heart rate or 210 GENERAL DISCUSSION temperature were altered. These data demonstrated, for the first time, the possibility of using the E-M window for the prediction of drug-induced TdP, and its advantages over looking at alterations in QT time alone. In Chapter 7 we extend the findings of van der Linde 23 to an anesthetized guinea- pig model. Using a number of clinical-reference compounds with varying degrees of torsadogenic potential, we show that ev en though TdP was no t induced in this model, the E-M window was able to discriminate compounds with known torsadogenic potential from compounds found to be safe, despite the fact that some of the latter agents alter repolarization times. Due to the cardiac electrophysiology of the guinea pig, with its strong 'repolarization reserve' due to slow deactivation of I Ks 24, 25, no TdP arrhythmias were actually seen in this study with one agent alone, and therefore a direct link between TdP and negative E-M windows could not be established. A more recent study 26, employing a strategy of a combined pharmacological assault, could however indu ce TdP arrhythmias in this model. This study illustrated that large negative E-M windows are a prerequisite for TdP induction in the anesthetized guinea pig. Taken together these findings are a first step in validation of this novel marker beyond the canine LQT1 model. Since the publication of van der Linde et al. 23, a number of groups have looked further into the E-M window, bo th in preclinical assays and also in its applicability to the clinical situation. Intere sting work in isolated heart preparations illustrated that IKs inhibition can lead to a reduction in th e E-M window in isolated minipig hearts 27. In addition, E-M windows remained more posi tive in mini-pig hearts than dog hearts, which may correlate with the resistance of the mini-pig heart to TdP arrhythmias. Finally, in dogs with chronic AV bloc k from our own laboratory, preliminary experiments show that the E-M window is drastically reduced when compared to sinus-rhythm animals and this is further exaggerates before the induction of TdP (Figure 1 ). Further investigation of thes e changes is clearly warranted. Figure 1: Changes in the E-M window after remodeling due to chronic AV block, and in the same animal just before dofetilide-ind uced aftercontractions and TdP are seen. 211 CHAPTER 8 Clinical data is also emerging that in patients with the congenital LQT syndrome, mean E-M windows were significantly more ne gative than in control patients (-60\u00b159 ms versus 4\u00b127 ms) 22. In addition, patients that were symptomatic had even more negative E-M windows when compared with asymptomatic LQT patients (-75\u00b168 ms versus -39\u00b136 ms). It appears therefore that negative E-M windows can set the stage for arrhythmia under certain conditions. Although it is likely that it is not the negative E-M window per se that is arrhythmogenic , it is likely that a negati ve window (meaning a situation with a long mechanical diastole during prolonged electrical systole) allows for arrhythmogenic aftercontractions to occur, which may provide a substrate for TdP, as demonstrated by Gallacher et al. 8. Although the exact mechanisms linking negative E-M windows to arrhythmia generation are still unclear, they possibly involve a 'window of opportun ity' for spontaneous SR Ca2+ release to occur in myocardium susceptible to Ca2+ overload, and/or the (re)activation of inward currents such as window I CaL, Na+-Ca2+ exchange (NCX) current or stretch- activated currents. In this context, it will be interesting to ultimately determine whether aftercontractions are the consequence of spontaneous or Ca 2+-induced Ca2+ release, and whether they activate inwa rd mechano-sensitive currents to prolong repolarization further. With regard to the latter, a number of stretch-activated ion channels operate in the cardiac myocyte including I Na 28. A recent study 29 interestingly showed that rano lazine, a drug with antiangi nal and antiarrhythmic (via (late) I Na) properties, also inhibits the mechanosensitivity of the Na+ channel. Whether this property plays a role in this ranolazine's electropharmacological profile remains to be seen. Other stretch-activated channels are also operative in the cardiac myocyte 22. Further understanding of the presumed mechano-electrical feedback in TdP generation is crucial to establish nove l antiarrhythmic strategies and for the development of safer medicinal compounds by pharmaceutical companies. 8.3 Cellular Determinants of BVR One of the major themes of this PhD thesis is the investigation of the mechanistic basis of BVR and how alterations in th is parameter may be arrhythmogenic, especially under conditions of sympathetic stimulation. BVR of the single myocyte most likely contributes to variability at the whole-heart level, although this is not the only governing factor 30, 31. Under normal conditions the sympathetic nervous system is involved in mediating the so-called 'fight or flight' response. Under conditions of physiological stress the activity of this system is increased, and amongst effects on other organ systems, leads to profound increases of the contractile and el ectrical function of the heart. The link between altered sympathetic tone and arrhyt hmogenesis has long been established. 212 GENERAL DISCUSSION For example, a study by Priori et al. 32 showed that electrical stimulation of the left stellate ganglion (part of the intrinsic sympathetic nervous system) led to the formation of delayed afterdepolarizations (DAD s) in the LV of anesthetized cats (see also Volders (2010) 33 ). As BVR is an important marker of arrhythmia. It is important to improve insights into how sympathetic stimulation affects this marker, which may increase our understanding of the antiarrhythmic actions of beta blockers 34, 35 and left cardiac sympathetic denervation 36, 37. In Chapter 3 our initial findings in single m y o c y t e s s h o w t h a t w h e n I Ks is intact, sympathetic stimulation can rescue increa sed BVR induced by interventions that undermine 'repolarization reserve'. It has been demonstrated that this reserve consists, at least partly, of $5-induced increases in I Ks 38 - 40. Challenges to I Ks may thus undermine the repolarization reserve. For instance, as shown in Figure 2 , the rescue of ATX-II-induced repolarization instability by isoproterenol (ISO) is undermined during I Ks blockade with HMR1556. Taken together, these data highlight the role of I Ks in repolarization reserve. Figure 2: Inhibition of I Ksby HMR1556 rev HUVHV\u0003WKH\u0003UHVFXH\u0003RI\u0003$5 stimulation on ATX-II- induced repolarization instability. 213 CHAPTER 8 Furthermore, in Chapter 3 we show that when I Ks is abolished pharmacologically and BVR increased VXEVWDQWLDOO\\\u0003XSRQ\u0003$5 stimulation, this was followed by the generation of both DADs and early afte rdepolarizations (EADs). Interestingly, the NCX current reduced the BVR increase that was observed under these conditions, indicating that Ca2+- dependent currents were responsible. These studies were expanded in Chapter 4 . In this chapter a combined experimental and computational approach was used to illustrate that increased BVR ca used by the combination of I Ks blockade and $5 stimulation was largely due to interspersed action-potential prolongation due to the generation of presystolic DADs. We then went on to show that this phenomenon was caused by differences in Ca 2+-dependent inactivation of the L-type Ca2+ current after presystolic spontaneous Ca2+ release. We showed that this interspersed action- potential prolongation was also seen in an in-vivo canine model of LQT1, albeit on monophasic action potentials , and this contributed to increased dispersion of repolarization, measured by T peak-Tend intervals, which may ulti mately play a role in arrhythmogenesis. As BVR appears to be a better proarrhythmic marker than repolarization duration alone it is also important to understand the relationships between action-potential duration (APD) and BVR, because it may be hypothesized that when APD increases, BVR is also augmented. Figure 3 illustrates the relation ships between these two parameters after diffe rent interventions. 214 GENERAL DISCUSSION Figure 3: Relationship of BVR and action potential duration (APD) under baseline conditions and after various interventions in single canine myocytes. Left panel, baseline conditions; Middle panel, after APD pr olongation by either I Kr blockade or late I Na augmentation. Finally, the right panel indicates that after various interventions that alter cellular Ca2+ handling this relationship can be subs tantially altered. The red 'cloud' in dicates cells that were exposed to IKs inhibLWLRQ\u0003WRJHWKHU\u0003ZLWK\u0003$5 stimulation (where BVR values are higher than would be expected for the given APD). The blue 'cloud' indi cates cells that were exposed to agents that reduce Ca2+ loading, for example BAPTA and ryanodine (after exposure to I Ks inhibition and $5 stimulation). Under these conditions BVR is lower than would be predicted from the APD values. As can be seen in Figure 3 , under baseline conditions the relationship between APD and BVR appears to be linear (R2=0.55), with BVR increasing at the same pace as APD. However when various interventions are applied to cause excessive prolongation of APD, for example during I Kr blockade, this relationship can be more reliably correlated with an exponential function (R2=0.72 for an exponential fit versus R2=0.67 for a linear fit). These data indica te that under 'normal' conditions, the major influence on BVR is indeed APD, however when APD prolongation becomes excessive, disproportionate increases in BVR can be seen. When interventions are applied that directly alter Ca2+ handling within the myocytes and cause spontaneous Ca2+ releases, for example after I Ks EORFN\u0003DQG\u0003$5 stimulation, this balance is altered, with high levels of BVR observed despite the fact that the average APD is relatively low. On the other hand, when Ca2+ releases are completely blocked, for example with ryanodine, the relationship is tipped in the other direction, wi th large APDs being seen with relatively low BVR. Interestingly, similar data have been accrued from cells isolated from dogs with CAVB. In these ce lls the exponential relationship that was seen between APD and BVR could be linearized by using high doses of caffeine to cause complete block of the ryanodine receptor (Antoons et al., personal communication). 215 CHAPTER 8 Taken together, these data indicate that Ca2+ handling within the myocytes has a significant influence on alterations in BVR, and also suggest that there are possibilities to prolong APD without increa sing BVR, should the correct balance be found. This has important implications fo r the proarrhythmic safety of medicinal compounds. Recent computer simulations of BVR (Hei jman et al., PhD thesis, Maastricht University, 2012) also support the notion that BVR is not only driven by APD and that stochastic gating strongly contributes to BVR. In that study an adapted computer model was developed to include such stocha stic channel gating. This was achieved by stimulating individual channels and cons idering the probability of state transition, or by including specific La ngevin terms in differential equations of 13 major ion channels and transporters. One of the majo r findings of this study was that APD prolongation strongly increased BVR, but this was not the only determinant of the exaggerated BVR seen under various conditions. The results described in this P h D t h e s i s a l s o g i v e i m p o rtant insights into other potential antiarrhythmic stra tegies. For example, an agent that can specifically prevent diastolic spontaneous Ca 2+ release without affecting systolic Ca2+ release may have great utility under conditions of increased Ca2+ loading. Such an agent would also preserve systolic functi on, conserving cardiac output. Altering Ca 2+ handling has been found to reduce arrhythmic events in various models, including the CAVB dog, with a numb er of these indicating that reduced BVR plays an important role. In the CAVB dog model, the susceptibility to triggered arrhythmias has been related to a diminished repolarization reserve and to SR Ca2+ overload, due to electrical and structural remodeling 41 - 44. Verduyn et al. 45 showed that both flunarizine and ryanodine could prevent I Kr-block-induced TdP. Furthermore, a recent study by Oros et al. 46 probed the antiarrhythmic mechanisms of flunarizine under these conditions and showed that this agent prevented dofetilide-induced TdP in thes e animals, which was also paralleled by BVR. This study w e n t o n t o s h o w t h a t f l u n a r i z i n e d e creased myocyte BVR and prevented the occurrence of EADs. In the same stud y, verapamil was also tested for its antiarrhythmic properties. Similarly to flun arizine, verapamil could prevent dofetilide- induced TdP, but interestingl y neither a decrease in QT times nor (monophasic) APD was seen with this agent, despite a reduction in BVR. These data further support the idea that under certain co nditions the relationship between BVR and APD can be dissociated. Perhaps supr isingly, Stams et al. 47 has reported that K201, an agent that has been shown to reduce the amount of Ca2+ leak from the SR 48, and that is under development for the prevention of atri al fibrillation, could neither suppress nor prevent dofetilide-induced TdP in the CAVB model. In fact, in the study of Stams et al. 47, high doses of this agent alone led to drug-induced TdP, and this was accompanied by an increase in BVR. 216 GENERAL DISCUSSION These findings may suggest that prevention of Ca2+ leak may not reduce BVR, however K201 not only inhibits Ca2+ leak but also inhibits mu ltiple other ion channels which may influence the potential antia rrhythmic properties of this agent. Furthermore this agent prevents Ca2+ leak via a very specific mechanism, (stabilization of the ryanodine receptor via inhibition of calstabin2) and perhaps this intervention alone is not enough to prevent spontaneous Ca2+ release. Further studies in other models of TdP, such as in the LQT1 dog, may give some important insights into the reasons why this agent does not seem to have antiarrhythmic properties, despite its apparent favorable profile. Interestingly, a number of studies have shown the applic ability of CAMKII inhibition for prevention of arrhythmogenic EADs 49, 50. Recently, Bourgonje et al. 51 showed an increase in CaMKII phosphorylation in the proarrhythmic CAVB-dog model and a reduction dofetilide-induced TdP after CAMK II inhibition with either W7 or KN-93. Work contained within this thesis provides further evidence that the strategy of CAMKII inhibition may be an alternative av enue for antiarrhythmic therapy, although clinically-safe specific inhibitors are not yet available to investigate this potential pharmacological breakthrough. Altering NCX activity has also been proposed as an attractive antiarrhythmic target. Inhibiting forward mode NCX is a modulator of EADs, especially under conditions of Ca 2+ overload. Our data support this notion and we have illustra ted the utility of the NCX inhibitor SEA0400 in preventing excess ive BVR in LQT1 stimulated myocytes (Chapter 3 ). Recent studies have substantia ted these data in different models. Bourgonje et al. 52 illustrated that SEA0400 is capabl e of reducing dofetilide-induced BVR (from 65 to 23 ms) despite prolonged APD in single myocytes isolated from CAVB dogs, as well as abolishing EADs. Si milarly, in-vivo this compound abolished dofetilide-induced TdP dose-dependently in these CAVB animals. Milberg et al. 53 have shown that SEA0400 reduced proarrhyth mia in a rabbit model of heart failure, although interestingly in this study, as opposed to the CAVB study, reductions in APD were observed. Currently, there is no definite answer as to how this strategy will fair in patients, and further research is warranted. However, these data are promising. In the studies contained in this thesis, in which cellular BVR was assessed, only LV myocytes were used. Interestingly, at the whole heart level, at least in the CAVB dog, only LV BVR appeared to be predictive of arrhythmia formation 30. In Chapter 5 of this thesis we show that there are sp ecific regional differe nces in the response WR\u0003$5 stimulation in the LV versus the right ventricle (RV). We demonstrate that there is an enhanced responsiveness of th H\u000359\u0003WR\u0003 AR stimulation which results from higher cAMP elevation in the cytoplasm due to a decreased degradation by PDE3 and P D E 4 i n t h e R V c o m p a r e d t o t h e L V . W e a l s o d e m o n s t r DWH\u0003WKDW\u0003HYHQ\u0003DIWHU\u0003$5 stimulation the pressures in the RV are sti ll much lower than those in the LV. It is well known that in-vivo the LV operates at much higher pressures than the RV. If we 217 CHAPTER 8 align this with other findings in th is thesis, namely that spontaneous Ca2+ releases are one of the mechanisms behind increased BVR, we could speculate that the increased total Ca 2+ loading in the LV contributes significantly to BVR in this ventricle. In the study of Gallacher et al. 8 EADs only appeared on the LV MAP recordings at the endocardial surface, and not on the LV epicardium or in the RV, which corroborates results from canine LV-wedge studies reported by Katra and Laurita 54 showing a predominant endocard ial origin of trig gered activity model of drug-induced LQT1 syndrome plus ISO. Previous studies have illustrated that both I Ks and I TO are larger in the RV when compared to the LV 55, and therefore this inferior 'repolarization reserve' in the LV may be a determinant of exaggerated BVR in the LV. Investigation of how alterations of no n-ionic targets, such as specific PDEs, change BVR and proarrhythmic outcomes is clearly needed. 8.4 Implications for Cardiac Safety Pharmacology and Future Directions Although it is well-known that inhibition of I Kr is not the only reason why drug- induced TdP can occur, the ICH S7B guideline only recommends screening compounds against this ion channel, together with an in-vivo QT assay. In the work presented in this thesis we have shown, in agreement with previous studies 30, 56 that safe prolongation of repolariza tion is possible and that that increases in repolarization times alone do not necessarily lead to th e occurrence of afterdepolarizations and proarrhythmia. In addition, we have fu rther validated the utility of BVR as a proarrhythmic marker in vivo and have given further insights into the mechanisms involved in BVR and arrhythmia g HQHUDWLRQ\u0003XQGHU\u0003FRQGLWLRQV\u0003RI\u0003$5\u0003 stimulation and the importance of I Ks in preventing excessive BVR. Previous work has clearly shown that under normal conditions I Ks has minimal effects on repolarization times under baseline conditions 38, 39, however its role becomes pr ominent during sympathetic stimulation or when repolarization is impaired by other factors (e.g., I Kr blockade 57). Recently, it has also been shown that this current has antiarrhythmic properties in a rabbit model of ischemia/reperfusion 58. Towart et al., 59 have also shown that a number of compounds that were thought to be safe from the I Kr screen and other in- vitro action potential assays, were actually highly proarrhythmic due to the fact that they had potent activity against I Ks, and for this reason it is proposed that screening against this ion channel should be carried out in the early stage of drug discovery. Therefore, it is clear that potential effects on I Ks should also be considered when assessing the propensity of new chemical entities to cause arrhythmia. Data contained within this thesis further illustr ate the need for such screening programs. These data also bring into question the reasoning that the proarrhythmic screening of new compounds occurs only under ba seline, normal healthy conditions. For example, APD assessment in-vit ro is nearly always carried out in tissue from healthy animals using physiological sa lt solutions, and in QT as sessments healthy animals are used. Contrary to this, the majority of pharmaceuticals are given to patients that are 218 GENERAL DISCUSSION not healthy, meaning that their response to the drug may be altered. In addition, a number of other factors will also influence the proarrhythmic potential of novel agents in the clinical situation, including genetic disposition (either with regards to drug metabolism or (silent) mutations in cardiac proteins) and drug-drug interactions. For example, pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs known to inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (among them CYP3A4 and CYP2D6) may enhance the torsadogenic potential of agents normal ly metabolized by these enzymes CYP3A4 activity itself can be inhibited by a wide variety of drugs including some macrolide antibiotics, ketoconazole and related antifungals, cimetidine, protease inhibitors, and amiodarone. In addition, other factors, including age, smoking, hepatic disease, genetic polymorphisms and even grapefruit juice may lead to CYP3A4 inhibition. It is therefore essential to examine the proa rrhythmic potential of chemical entities in disease models and also at supratherapeutic doses. In this thesis we demonstrate that the proarrhythmic potential of AZD1305 could be detected in a proarrhythmic model, despite appearing safe from variou s preclinical assays. This compound did indeed cause TdP arrhythmias in selected patients. In addition to the use of proarrhythmic models for screening, consid eration should also be given to testing compounds under altered physiological conditions, for example during sympathetic stimulation or conditions of altered electrolytes 60. Over recent years development of patient-specific human induced pluripoten t stem cells (iPSCs) and human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CM) have been introduced as new paradigm for modeling human disease and for individualizing drug testing 61, 62. However, a recent stud y from Jonsson et al. 63 has shown that the hESC-CM system has a number of weaknesses with regards to their electrophysiological phenotype, and consequently their potential as a safe ty pharmacology model. Therefore, much work remains to be done to fully understa nd the usefulness of stem-cell technology in cardiac safety pharmacology, and it will only be when these milestones have been reached before such systems will be widely adopted by the community. In addition, we present a novel marker of proarrhythmia, the E-M window, in a small animal model, which appears to be anothe r more reliable marker of TdP than QT prolongation alone. Intere stingly the detection of ad verse effects on cardiac contractility is also emerging in safety-pharmacology studies 64. Various publications have described in-vitro 65 and in-vivo models 66 - 68 for assessing ca rdiac contractile parameters for safety asse ssment and in a number of pharmaceutical companies telemetry studies recording LV pressures during drug ad ministration are routinely carried out. The integration of both elec trical and mechanical recordings in one model has some clear advantages, including reducing the number of animal experiments required for drug developmen t. Furthermore the integration of such parameters in a small animal model, may me an that these studies can be carried out at an earlier stage of drug discovery to en sure only the safest drug candidates are pursued. 219 CHAPTER 8 Finally, in Chapter 4 of this thesis, a combined experimental and computational approach is applied. Recently the use of computer modeling in safety pharmacology has received increasing attent ion, especially in the contex t of cardiac action potential modeling. A number of action potential mo dels are currently available and these models are amongst some of the most detailed models in systems biology 69. A recent example of such an approach in the safety pharmacology arena came from Davies et al. 70, who developed an in -silico canine AP model to provide an assessment of the effect of a compound on the myocyte APD using concentration- HIIHFW\u0003FXUYH\u0003GDWD\u0003IURP\u0003D\u0003SDQHO\u0003RI\u0003\u00bfYH\u0003FDUGLDF\u0003LRQ\u0003FKDQQHOV\u0011\u00038QL TXHO\\\u0003WKLV\u0003PRGHO\u0003ILWWHG\u0003 traces from 19 various in-vitro cellular experiments, with various ion-channel conductances, meaning that some variability was introduced into the model. In this model differential responses were seen in the 19 different 'cells' potentially explaining some of the observed variation in reaction to drugs. This work is a first step in developing and integr ating multiple models to re present variability that may occur in patient populations. A number of other approaches have also been applied to integrate computer modeling into cardiac safety studies 71 - 73. In this thesis computer modeling was used primarily to direct our experiments in the 'wet laboratory' and in addition it allows us to specifically analyze multiple parameters simultaneously (e.g., I Ks, ICaL and Ca2+ transients) which is not currently possible in an experimental set-up. In addition modeling allows for specific targeting of proteins or ion channels, which, due to compound spec ificity issues, is not always the case in an experimental set-up. Over the next decades computer modeling will play an increasing role in providing such important information. One of the major questions remaining is ho w much validation of a novel arrhythmia m a r k e r i s r e q u i r e d b e f o r e i t i s a d o p t e d b y r e g u l a t o r y a g e n c i e s , a n d u l t i m a t e l y pharmaceutical companies. For example, in -vivo BVR was proposed as a marker for proarrhythmia back in 2004. However, at least to our knowledge, it has not been commonly adopted as a routine screening strategy. Whether this will also be the case for other proarrhythmic markers such as the E-M window remains to be seen. Also, the question is raised whether guidelines, such as the ICH S7B, need to be updated in the light of recent data such as those contained in this thesis. There is still a need for intense clinical investig ation of the link between such markers and arrhythmogenesis, which may aid in decisi on-making. Recently a large multicentre clinical study has been co mmenced that will investigat e current shortcomings in sudden cardiac death risk stratification and answer several related research questions, including the utility of BVR. The initial patient recruitm ent is underway and was expected to be completed by July 2012, with follow-up expected to end in September 2014 74. The results of this trial and consequent actions are highly anticipated. 220 GENERAL DISCUSSION References (1) Wysowski DK, Bacsanyi J. Cisapride and fatal arrhythmia. N Engl Med . 1996;335:290-1.

Synchronous pump function is dr iven by electrical signals, called action potentials. Under normal conditions thes e signals are generated and regulated by pacemaker cells within the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is located within right atrium. These electrical signals then enter the base of the ventricle at the Bundle of His and then follow the left and right bundle branches along the interventricular septum. The bundle branches then divide into an extensive system of Purkinje fibers that conduct the impulses at high velocity throughout the ventricles. This results in rapid depolarization of ventricular myocytes th both ventricles. In mammalian ventricular myocytes the action potentia l consists of a prolonged plateau phase where calcium ions can enter the myocytes of the ventricle, this triggers calcium induced calcium release, a process essentia l for excitation-contraction coupling. The global electrical signal of the heart is re flected in the electrocardiogram, and various parameters can be extrapolated from this signal, including the QT time which is utilized as a measure of repolarization duration. The normal cardiac rhythm is very regula r, with minimal fluctuation allowing for continual blood flow, however it can be al tered to meet the oxygen demand by nervous impulses or by circulatory subs tances, including the adrenergic agonist adrenaline. Under certain co nditions however the rhythm of the heart can become irregular, too fast (tachycardia) or too slow (bradycardia), or the beats of the atria and ventricle become unsynchronized. Th ese arrhythmias can be caused by a multitude of both extrinsic and intrinsic factors, including genetic mutations (for example Long QT1 syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)), cardiomyopathies an also be drug-induced. Over recent years drug-induced arrhythmia s have received incr eased attention, in particular drug-induced Torsades de Pointe s (TdP). This arrhythmia is a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that can deteriorate into ventricular fibrillation and ultimately sudden cardiac death, and is normally seen in the context of a prolonged QT interval on the ECG. Although regulatory guidelines are in place to prevent compounds causing such arrhythmias getting to market, various pharmacological agents have been shown to cause this arrhythmia, and this has led to the withdrawal of a number of compounds. Currently prolon gation of the QT interval an d inhibition of one of the major ionic currents (I Kr) are used as surrogate marker s that a compound may cause TdP, however this strategy ca n still lead to both false ne gatives and false positives, a situation that is detrimental to drug development. 231 ENGLISH SUMMARY The major aim of this thesis was to furthe r understand mechanisms involved in the g e n e r a t i o n o f t h i s d e a d l y a r rhythmia, leading to improved prediction and prevention of this potentially deadly arrhythmia. Chapter 1 is a general introduction, in which a background to cellular cardiac electrophysiology is given, as is an overview of the problem of drug-induced TdP and the current strategies for dealing with this issue at the preclinical stage of drug development. It is in this chapter where the concepts of beat-to-beat variability of repolarization (BVR) and the electro-mechanical (E-M) window are introduced. Finally in this chapter the aims and goal s of the thesis are formulated. In Chapter 2 we describe in detail a number of protocols for assessing changes in action potential duration in canine ventricu lar myocytes utilizing both optical imaging and electrophysiological techniques. We also present a protocol for assessing the occurrence of after-depolarizations and BVR at the level of the single cell. Both of these protocols can be utilized in card iac safety pharmacology studies to predict the proarrhythmic potential of novel chemical entities and we illustrate how these protocols can reliably detect the electrophysi ological effects of a number of reference compounds. In Chapter 3 we use one of the techniques described in Chapter 2 to investigate how BVR can manifest itself at the single cell le vel. In this chapter is olated myocytes were XVHG\u0003WR\u0003LQYHVWLJDWH\u0003 WKH\u0003LPSRUWDQFH\u0003RI\u0003 -DGUHQHUJLF\u0003UHFHSWRU\u0003 $5 of excessive increases in BVR following I Kr blockade and augmented late I Na. We show that both increases in action potential durations either by I Kr blockade or augmentation of late I Na leads to increased BVR, and these increases can EH\u0003FRXQWHUDFWHG\u0003E\\\u0003$5\u0003VWLPXODW ion, most likely due to th e concomitant increase in IKs. In addition we illustrate that an incr eased BVR corresponds with an increased occurrence of afterdepolarizations, furt her illustrating the usefulness of this parameter in prediction of arrhythmia. In terestingly we also show that under conditions of I Ks EORFNDGH\u0003DQG\u0003$5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ\u000f\u0003VLPLODU\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003/47\u0014\u0003SKHQRW\\SH\u000f\u0003%9 5\u0003LV\u0003 exacerbated and this is also accompanied by the occurrence of afterdepolarizations. Both the increase in BVR and the afterdepol arizations can be abolished by chelation of intracellular calcium or by inhibition of the Sodium-Calcium exchanger current illustrating the possible utili ty of this strategy as a preventative antiarrhythmic treatment. In Chapter 4 we further develop the findings in Chapter 3 by investigating the specific mechanisms of BV R under conditions of I Ks EORFNDGH\u0003DQG\u0003$5\u0003VWLPXODWLRQ\u0011\u0003 Using a variety of techniques we show that under these conditions spontaneous calcium releases (SCR) drive the increase in BVR by causing interspersed action potential prolongation. We illustrate that this is due to alterations in the inactivation of the L-type calcium channe l after such calcium releases . A number of strategies, 232 ENGLISH SUMMARY including CAMKII inhibition and treatment with magnesium were able to significantly reduce BVR, and hence we propose a number of preventative strategies in this chapter. These findings were extended be yond the single cell by investigating this phenomenon in both a whole animal model of LQT1 and in multicellular computer models. The findings shown in the single ce ll, also have relevance in both of these models, illustrating the fact that these da ta have significant translational value. These data also illustrate the fact that de layed afterdepolarizations caused by SCRs can not only initiate arrhythmogenesis by causing triggered activity, but also contribute by increasing the temporal an d spatial dispersion of repolarization. Data included in Chapter 5 shows that there are specific regional differences in the response to $5\u0003 VWLPXODWLRQ\u0003 in the left versus the right ventricle (RV). We demonstrate that there is an enhanced responsiveness of the RV to $5\u0003stimulation caused by higher cAMP elevation in the cytoplasm due to a decreased degradation by PDE3 and PDE4 in the RV compared to the LV. These data further illustrate interventricular differences which may be utilized to specifically intervene under various arrhythmic conditions. Further st udies should concentrate on how this balance is altered under pathogenic cond itions, which may aid in development of safer agents for prevention of arrhythmia In Chapter 6 we move from the single cell to the whole animal .The chronic AV block dog model has been used for a number of years as a proarrhythmic model as in these animals structural and electrophysiol ogical remodeling render these animals highly susceptible for TdP. In this chapte r we use the novel multi ion channel blocker AZD1305 to further investigate the utility of BVR as a proarrhythmic marker in vivo. We show that AZD1305 has a lower proa rrhythmic potential than the pure I Kr blocker dofetilide in this model, despite both agents causing similar degrees of repolarization prolongation. Interestingly BVR of the left ventricular monophasic action potential was only increased after admini stration of dofetilide, furthe r indicating the superiority of this proarrhythmic marker in prediction of TdP arrhythmia. Although AZD1305 did cause TdP in a subset of animals, thes e data further illustrate that the approach of inhibition of multiple (i nward and outward) currents holds great promise as a safe antiarrhythmic strategy. Chapter 7 investigates the utility of the E-M window as a predictive marker of TdP occurrence in a guinea pig model. The E-M window has recently been proposed as a novel marker for the prediction of TdP in a dog model of LQT1, and takes into account the temporal difference between th en end of mechanical and electrical systole. We illustrate that when anaesthe tized guinea pigs are challenged with agents that are known torsadogens, the E-M window becomes negative, with the electrical activity lasting longer than th e mechanical activity. Interestingly when the electrical activity was 'safely' prolonged the E-M window did not become negative, 233 ENGLISH SUMMARY illustrating the fact that this surrogate marker is superior and is more robust than looking at repolarizati on duration alone. In the final chapter of this thesis, Chapter 8 , the main findings of this thesis are discussed together with both their possibl e significance for both drug development (prediction ) and novel antiarrhythmic strategies ( prevention ) of drug induced TdP. In conclusion the data provided within this thesis illustra tes the importance of factors other than repolarization duration prolongation and the influence of $5\u0003stimulation and calcium handling in the manifestation of drug-induced arrhythmias. Insights are given into possible nove l markers to improve the prediction of arrhythmia as well as possible antiarrhythmic mechanisms to prevent drug induced TdP. 234 NEDERLANDSE SAMENVATTING Samenvatting De functie van het hart is hoofdzakelijk continue bloed door het vatensysteem van bovenkant van van dan ook om het mechanistische begrip van TdP breiden, eden van na-depolarisaties en de mate van BVR op het niveau INa toename, tonen.

Without the support and co-ope ration of these people this PhD thesis would not have been produced and therefore I would like to thank everyone who has helped me over the last years. Below is my attempt to name a few of these people but this is by no means exhaustive! First and foremost I would like to thank my promotion team. Dr. Paul Volders , dear Paul, I am very grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to carry out my PhD thesis in your group, and for your continue d support and input during this trajectory. I still remember our email exchanges back in 2005 from my desk at Merck, where I mention looking forward to the next four ye ars of working in Maastricht for my PhD. It took a bit longer than that! Despite your busy clinical schedule, over the years we have had many scientific discussions (often on a Friday afternoon, lasting into the evening..) and late night email exchanges wh ich have led to the completion of this thesis. Your knowledge of th e literature continues to astound me and I hope that we can continue to collaborate in the future. Thanks for everything. Dr. Najah Abi-Gerges , dear Najah, my industrial co -promotor. We have had many telephone calls over the years and you were always very welcoming during my visits to Alderley Park. During these meetings we would have long discussions together with the rest of the Safety Pharmacology team, and I would return to Maastricht with recharged batteries and new ideas. Without your continued provision of myocytes it would not have been possible to complete a number of studies contained within this thesis. It was also reassuring to hear when I wasn't the only one having problems getting recordings from these cells. I wish you all the best for the future. I would like to thank Prof. Harry Crijns for acting as my promotor. During our progress meetings you were always extremely interested in the latest set of data and your enthusiasm on the subject was always infectious. A special word of thanks should also go here to Miriam Habex for secretarial assistance. I would also like to thank Prof. Uli Schotten , Prof. Anton Gorgels , Prof. Tim Hammond , Prof. Marc Vos , and Prof. Thomas Unger for critically reading this thesis as part of the thesis assessment committee and for agreeing to be part of the corona at the defence of this thesis. I am also indebted to my 'paranimfen' Monique de Jong and Roel Sp\u00e4tjens , not only for standing by me on the day of my defence but also for all the support they have given me over the years. 241 DANKWOORD Monique , your mantra of 'don't touch the green' is forever embedded in my brain. We have spent many, many hours in the operation room over the years and we have had many laughs! Positioning of MAP cathet ers was always an interesting experience and I'm sure when visitors came in during this process they thought that we were arguing, although this wasn't the case. Thanks for putting up with me on a Monday morning, making sure there was coffee on my arrival (especially on a Monday), and the late working nights. Thanks for our various discussions over numerous coffees and thank you for going through this thes is on numerous occasions to check the formatting issues! Roel, your ability to successfully isolate my ocytes time after time and your eye for making figures have been vital over the year s! Thanks for all the solution preparation and the hours spent trying to patch. In addition your help on non-scientific issues and form filling was always appreciated. I wish you and your ladies all the best for the future! A big thanks also to all members of the group over the years. Jordi , I remember you coming in to the team as a Bachelor student and since then y o u h a v e h a d a l a r g e i m p a c t o n t h e w o r k i n t h i s t h e s i s ( a n d v e r y s u c c e s s f u l l y defended your own!). I enjoyed our variou s discussions and your input on our joint projects. Without your software I think we would still be analyzing DADs... We really need to go for that beer soon! I wish you and Claire all the best in Essen/Heidelberg and beyond. Matthijs , good luck with the rest of your PhD research and combining this with your medical studies. I am really looking forward to seeing your results with the ECGI system. Rachel , all the best in your ongoin g investigations on the EM window. I am very interested in se eing what the results will show. Miren , I wish you all the best back in Spain. I will always remember your Tamagotchi from the Nantes 2012 meeting! Marketa , it has been a while since you were in Maastricht but all the best for the future, I hope we will catch up again at future meetings. Inge, another ex-postdoc, I hope all is going we ll with your studies and family. Dirk , it is already a long time since you completed your thesis , but thanks for letting me get some in- vivo experience during some of your experiments. Helma , thanks for your assistance trying to get good myocyte staining. I look forward to seeing the latest data. Sandrine , thanks for preparing solutions and all the best for the family. Viola , again it has been a while since you left Maastricht for your Peruvian adventure, but thanks for the solutions. Annerie , I wish you all the best for the future. Lucien , all the best and Michael , i hope the combinatorial approach of patch clamping and modelling is going well and look forward to seeing your first results. Theo , it has also been while since your retirement, but thank you for your assistance in the OR at the beginning of this thesis. Finally Pol, although officially a member of CTC (whilst you were in Maastricht), thank you for all the time you spent in the OR with us and for your assistance. All the best for the future. 242 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would also like to thank members of othe r departments who have assisted me over the years. Firstly to all the people who have shared an office with me . Veronica , Blanche , Esther , Anna and you for putting up with my 'organised mess' of a desk and for listening to my gripes. Also thanks to Arne , Bart and Ali for the coffee breaks. I would also like to thank Joyce Suyk and her CPV team for looking after the animals that were used in these studies. This thesis would not have been possible without the financial support from Astrazeneca. In addition to these financ ial aspects, I have also had numerous discussions with members of the safety pharmacology grou p in Alderley Park over the years. Both Drs. Jean-Pierre Valentin and Chris Pollard have provided interesting and im portant insights. I would also like to thank Dr. Michael Morton for carrying out some of the myocyte isolations and Dr. Will Redfern for providing Figure 2 in Chapter 1. Additionally I would like to thank Dr. Leif Carlsson, from AZ Sweden, for providing us with AZD1305 and fo r all the advice whilst carrying out the studies with this compound. O v e r r e c e n t y e a r s I h a v e a l s o b e e n c o l l a b o r a t i n g w i t h t h e g r o u p o f Dr. David Gallacher , in particular the anaestheti zed canine group headed by Henk van der Linde from Janssen Pharmaceuticals. Thank you for always being so welcoming on my visits to the Beerse site to gather that last bits of data for Chapter 4 of this thesis, and also for always provid ing data quickly and efficiently. I would also like to thank Bruno Van Deuren and Yves Somers for helping in carrying out these experiments and also in the labour intensive analysis. I would like to thank Dr. Pieter-Jan Guns for providing a very pleasant working environment during my time at Bio- Plus and for collaboration on the electromechanical window studies. I wish you all the best at the University of Antwerp and also for your (and Valerie's) i mminent arrival. I would also like to thank Dr. Rashmi Shah for providing the data contained in Table 1 of the introductory chapter of this thesis. There have also been a number of collaborations with other members of the academic world. The groups of Prof. David Eisner and Prof. Andy Trafford from the University of Manchester provided important data and expertise that have been included in Chapter 4. In particular I would like to thank Dr. Dave Greensmith and Liz Bode for carrying out these experiments and also for your hospitality during my trip to Manchester. Likewise I would like to thank the team of Prof. Rodolphe Fischmeister from INSERM for their collaborations leading to Ch apter 5. I would like to especially thank Drs. Gregoire Vandecasteele , J\u00e9r\u00f4me Leroy and Cristina Molina (thanks for the late night FRET and patching an d all the best back in Barcelona). We will get this 243 DANKWOORD article published in the short term. An additional thank you goes to Prof. Fischmeister for making the trip to Maastricht to be a member of the corona. Finally I would like to thank the people who have contributed to this thesis in other ways. First of all, although now it seems like a lifetime ago, i would like to thank my old supervisors from Terling's Park, Drs. Zahid Ali , Karen Maubach and Kathy Sutton , for introducing me to the world of electrophysiology, and also for the support on my departure from Merck. I would also like to thank all the people that I have met along the way during this process. Although you have now all left M aastricht you all helped me adjust to the move to Maastricht. Nick, Darryn , James , Apo, Eric, Nieves , Anna . Thanks for the nights in Take Five and Zondag and at the Quiz night, they made for a very pleasant distraction! I would also like to thank my friends, in particular Warren , Will, Alex, Ed, Fahd and Elena for their continued support during th is process and for their trips to continental Europe. Janice and Ian, I would also like to thank you for your support and hopefully after March 8 th you may finally understand some of the things I have been doing for the last years. Ik wil ook mijn in Antwerpen. It is a real shame you can't make it for the defence but you can put a bet on for me in Las Vegas! We will go for a celebratory beer soon! Mum , without your support I would not be stan ding here today. Not just throughout this process but throughout everything I have done. When I told you I was considering a move to the Netherlands to carry out a PhD you have been nothing but supportive and have remained positive all the way through this process, even when I was less so! Being over in the Netherlands has meant that sometimes it has not been that easy to get back to Leeds but I hope that now this is finally completed that Kim, Hannah and I will be able to get ov er to the UK more often so that we can spend more time together. Thanks for everything. 244 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Finally Kim, if someone had told me when I started this thesis that when I finished it I would have a Flemish 'wife', a daughter an d a house, I would have told them that they were crazy. However this is exactl y how it has ended up and I could not be happier with the result! You know by now th at I am not very good with words ('Dear Kim...' ), but without your endless support and love this thesis would never have come to fruition. There are many examples of this but one that sticks out it is whenever 'Dave' turned up at the house with myocytes at silly a.m. in the mornings. You never complained and then would even take me to work so that I could get on with experiments. You would then put up with me when I got back after a twenty something hour lab stint (not easy I think..). Now that my 'boekje' is finally finished, I cannot wait to start the next chapter of our lives together, now with our wonderful little girl, who makes me laugh every day (another reason to thank you!). Ik hou heel veel van jou. Dikke knuffel (still my favorite Dutch word). Hannah , seeing your smile in the morning make s it all worth it and your presence has put everything into perspective. You re ally are the best daughter we could ever dream of, especially as your character bl ooms more and more each day. You have already shown your appreciation of beat-t o-beat variability of repolarization by calming down when I read you a chapter of this thesis, so who knows what the future will bring -. I cannot wait to watch you grow up and I will try to be the best 'papa' I can be. 245 246 CURRICULUM VITAE Curriculum Vitae Daniel M.
