Between its high mutation rate and the fact that it attacks the immune system itself, HIV has a frustrating tendency to evade immune surveillance. But, as scientists have discovered a number of naturally occurring neutralizing antibodies and areas of the virus that tend to remain mutation free, hopes have been rising that this information could lead to an effective vaccine. But one major trial, called the STEP Study, was brought to an end early after [preliminary analyses](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2808%2961591-3/abstract) [suggested that](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2808%2961592-5/abstract) those who received the vaccine picked up HIV infections at rates higher than controls. That's clearly not how vaccines are supposed to work, but an answer to the obvious question\u2014why did the vaccine make things worse?\u2014could help researchers understand HIV biology better and perhaps craft an improved vaccine. The leading explanation for this puzzling behavior, however, took a severe blow thanks to two papers released today by Nature Medicine. The vaccine involved in the trial was produced by Merck, where scientists had engineered a relatively innocuous virus, Adenovirus 5, to carry genes derived from HIV. In the course of fighting off this innocuous infection, the reasoning went, individuals would also generate an immune response to HIV that would be sufficient to prevent the virus from establishing itself in the course of future exposures. In the wake of the study, an analysis correlated the elevated rates of HIV acquisition with the levels of antibodies directed against the adenovirus. That led researchers to develop a hypothesis for what they termed the \"counterprotective\" nature of the vaccine: its administration resulted in an immune response to the adenovirus that included activated helper T-cells. Since these T-cells are targeted by HIV, the vaccine effectively gave HIV more cells to infect, explaining the results of the preliminary trial. Unfortunately, the trial was designed such that there was no organized attempt to assay for Adeno-specific T-cells before and after the vaccine was administered. The two papers are the product of the fact that some of the clinical centers involved in the trial had performed relevant assays across the course of the vaccination protocol, and could shed some light on whether adeno-specific T-cells were involved. The answer, unfortunately, is probably not. There was no statistically significant correlation between the number of adeno-specific antibodies and adeno-specific T-cells, either before or after the vaccine was administered. Levels of the immune-regulatory proteins, called cytokines, produced by helper T-cells also showed no correlation with levels of adeno-specific antibodies. In short, antibodies against the adenovirus vaccine may represent something significant, but that something doesn't appear to be the T-cells targeted by HIV. So the biomedical community will have to go back and try to come up with other ideas about what might be going on with this vaccine. In the meantime, however, this still represents a serious setback; referring to the original STEP Trial results, the authors of one paper write that \"These findings largely paralyzed the HIV-1 vaccine field.\" Until we understand the biology behind them, it's very unlikely that anyone will be anxious to put any other vaccines into human subjects.
