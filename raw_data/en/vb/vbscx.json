I graduated from the University of Melbourne, with postgraduate degrees in veterinary acupuncture & veterinary Chinese herbal medicine. My process is to build meaningful relationships with clients through assisting them with their animal's health and longevity. I provide holistic treatment for your pets, using my knowledge of Western and Eastern veterinary medicine. See my services below, or [get in touch](#contact) for more information! Acupuncture dates back to 2500 BC. With endless scientific studies and research to verify the efficacy of acupuncture which works with the meridians of the human body, acupuncture works also with animals, as they too have meridians. The benefits of acupuncture include: releasing the muscle or tissue locally, decreasing obstruction and stagnation along the associated meridian, influencing corresponding organs and tonifying or sedating imbalances in the body. Chinese medicine is prescribed depending on the patient's constitution, with most animals tolerating Chinese herbs very well. They come in different preparations, so I work with the individual to find the right form to administer. Chinese herbs treat a variety of conditions and are a great preventative when used in conjunction with tongue and pulse diagnosis, to prevent the body from shifting into an unbalanced state where disease develops. Integrative medicine refers to the treatment that incorporates both Western and Eastern medical knowledge and techniques. No single treatment is a miracle cure. I work with my clients to combine therapies, daily routines and diet to gain the best possible outcome for their animal's health and wellbeing. A large part of integrative medicine is diet. Diet therapy is often sufficient to heal an existing health condition. I also offer up-to-date modern medicine with a focus on diagnostics, including the below services: Dr Crystal's is located at: 139 Surrey Road North "}
