See Transportation under What Medical Expenses Are Includible, later. Health coverage tax credit (HCTC). The HCTC was not extended. The credit is not available after 2021. If you are an eligible trade adjustment assistance (TAA) recipient, an alternative TAA recipient, a reemployment TAA recipient or a Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation payee, then you will no longer use Form 8885 before completing Schedule A, line 1. Reminders Photographs of missing children. The IRS is a proud partner with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children\u00ae (NCMEC). Photographs of missing children selected by the Center may appear in this publication on pages that would otherwise be blank. You can help bring these children home by looking at the photographs and calling 800-THE-LOST (800-843-5678) if you recognize a child. Introduction This publication explains the itemized deduction for medical and dental expenses that you claim on Schedule A (Form 1040). It discusses what expenses, and whose expenses, you can and can't include in figuring the deduction. It explains how to treat reimbursements and how to figure the deduction. It also tells you how to report the deduction on your tax return and what to do if you sell medical property or receive damages for a personal injury. Medical expenses include dental expenses, and in this publication the term \"medical expenses\" is often used to refer to medical and dental expenses. You can deduct on Schedule A (Form 1040) only the part of your medical and dental expenses that is more than 7.5% of your adjusted gross income (AGI). This publication also explains how to treat impairment-related work expenses and health insurance premiums if you are self-employed. Pub. 502 covers many common medical expenses but not every possible medical expense. If you can't find the expense you are looking for, refer to the definition of medical expenses under What Are Medical Expenses, later.

Useful Items You may want to see: Publication 969 Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans Forms (and Instructions) 1040 U.S. Individual Income Tax Return 1040-SR U.S. Tax Return for Seniors Schedule A (Form 1040) Itemized Deductions 8962 Premium Tax Credit (PTC) Publication 502 - Main Contents What Are Medical Expenses? Medical expenses are the costs of diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and for the purpose of affecting any part or function of the body. These expenses include payments for legal medical services rendered by physicians, surgeons, dentists, and other medical practitioners. They include the costs of equipment, supplies, and diagnostic devices needed for these purposes. Medical care expenses must be primarily to alleviate or prevent a physical or mental disability or illness. They don't include expenses that are merely beneficial to general health, such as vitamins or a vacation. Medical expenses include the premiums you pay for insurance that covers the expenses of medical care, and the amounts you pay for transportation to get medical care. Medical expenses also include amounts paid for qualified long-term care services and limited amounts paid for any qualified long-term care insurance contract. What Expenses Can You Include This Year? You can include only the medical and dental expenses you paid this year, but generally not payments for medical or dental care you will receive in a future year. (But see Decedent under Whose Medical Expenses Can You Include, later, for an exception.) This is not the rule for determining whether an expense can be reimbursed by a flexible spending arrangement (FSA). If you pay medical expenses by check, the day you mail or deliver the check is generally the date of payment. If you use a \"pay-by-phone\" or \"online\" account to pay your medical expenses, the date reported on the statement of the financial institution showing when payment was made is the date of payment. If you use a credit card, include medical expenses you charge to your credit card in the year the charge is made, not when you actually pay the amount charged. If you didn't claim a medical or dental expense that would have been deductible in an earlier year, you can file Form 1040-X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, to claim a refund for the year in which you overlooked the expense. Don't claim the expense on this year's return. Generally, a claim for refund must be filed within 3 years from the date the original return was filed or within 2 years from the time the tax was paid, whichever is later. You can't include medical expenses that were paid by insurance companies or other sources. This is true whether the payments were made directly to you, to the patient, or to the provider of the medical services. Separate returns. If you and your spouse live in a noncommunity property state and file separate returns, each of you can include only the medical expenses each actually paid. Any medical expenses paid out of a joint checking account in which you and your spouse have the same interest are considered to have been paid equally by each of you, unless you can show otherwise. Community property states. If you and your spouse live in a community property state and file separate returns or are registered domestic partners in Nevada, Washington, or California, any medical expenses paid out of community funds are divided equally. Generally, each of you should include half the expenses. If medical expenses are paid out of the separate funds of one individual, only the individual who paid the medical expenses can include them. If you live in a community property state and aren't filing a joint return, see Pub. 555, Community Property. How Much of the Expenses Can You Deduct? Generally, you can deduct on Schedule A (Form 1040) only the amount of your medical and dental expenses that is more than 7.5% of your AGI. Whose Medical Expenses Can You Include? You can generally include medical expenses you pay for yourself, as well as those you pay for someone who was your spouse or your dependent either when the services were provided or when you paid for them. There are different rules for decedents and for individuals who are the subject of multiple support agreements. See Support claimed under a multiple support agreement, later, under Qualifying Relative. Spouse You can include medical expenses you paid for your spouse. To include these expenses, you must have been married either at the time your spouse received the medical services or at the time you paid the medical expenses. Example 1. Taxpayer A received medical treatment before marrying Taxpayer B. B paid for the treatment after they married. B can include these expenses in figuring B's medical expense deduction even if B and A file separate returns. If A had paid the expenses, B couldn't include A's expenses on B's separate return. The amounts A paid during the year would be included on A's separate return. If they filed a joint return, the medical expenses both paid during the year would be used to figure their medical expense deduction. Example 2. This year, Taxpayer X paid medical expenses for Taxpayer Y, the spouse, who died last year. X married Taxpayer Z this year and they file a joint return. Because X was married to Y when Y received the medical services, X can include those expenses in figuring X's medical expense deduction for this year. Dependent You can include medical expenses you paid for your dependent. For you to include these expenses, the person must have been your dependent either at the time the medical services were provided or at the time you paid the expenses. A person generally qualifies as your dependent for purposes of the medical expense deduction if both of the following requirements are met. The person was a qualifying child (defined later) or a qualifying relative (defined later). The person was a U.S. citizen or national or a resident of the United States, Canada, or Mexico. If your qualifying child was adopted, see Exception for adopted child, later. You can include medical expenses you paid for an individual that would have been your dependent except that: The person received gross income of $4,400 or more in 2022; The person filed a joint return for 2022; or You, or your spouse if filing jointly, could be claimed as a dependent on someone else's 2022 return. Exception for adopted child. If you are a U.S. citizen or national and your adopted child lived with you as a member of your household for 2022, that child doesn't have to be a U.S. citizen or national, or a resident of the United States, Canada, or Mexico. Qualifying Child A qualifying child is a child who: Is your son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, half brother, half sister, or a descendant of any of them (for example, your grandchild, niece, or nephew); Was: Under age 19 at the end of 2022 and younger than you (or your spouse if filing jointly), Under age 24 at the end of 2022, a full-time student, and younger than you (or your spouse if filing jointly), or Any age and permanently and totally disabled; Lived with you for more than half of 2022; Didn't provide over half of their own support for 2022; and Didn't file a joint return, other than to claim a refund. Adopted child. A legally adopted child is treated as your own child. This child includes a child lawfully placed with you for legal adoption. You can include medical expenses that you paid for a child before adoption if the child qualified as your dependent when the medical services were provided or when the expenses were paid. If you pay back an adoption agency or other persons for medical expenses they paid under an agreement with you, you are treated as having paid those expenses provided you clearly substantiate that the payment is directly attributable to the medical care of the child. But if you pay the agency or other person for medical care that was provided and paid for before adoption negotiations began, you can't include them as medical expenses. .You may be able to take a credit for other expenses related to an adoption. See the Instructions for Form 8839, Qualified Adoption Expenses, for more information.. Child of divorced or separated parents. For purposes of the medical and dental expenses deduction, a child of divorced or separated parents can be treated as a dependent of both parents. Each parent can include the medical expenses they pay for the child, even if the other parent claims the child's dependency exemption, if: The child is in the custody of one or both parents for more than half the year; The child receives over half of the child's support during the year from the parents; and The child's parents: Are divorced or legally separated under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance, Are separated under a written separation agreement, or Live apart at all times during the last 6 months of the year. This doesn't apply if the child's exemption is being claimed under a multiple support agreement (discussed later). Qualifying Relative A qualifying relative is a person: Who is your: Son, daughter, stepchild, or foster child, or a descendant of any of them (for example, your grandchild), Brother, sister, half brother, half sister, or a son or daughter of any of them, Father, mother, or an ancestor or sibling of either of them (for example, your grandmother, grandfather, aunt, or uncle), Stepbrother, stepsister, stepfather, stepmother, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, or Any other person (other than your spouse) who lived with you all year as a member of your household if your relationship didn't violate local law, Who wasn't a qualifying child (see Qualifying Child, earlier) of any taxpayer for 2022, and For whom you provided over half of the support in 2022. But see Child of divorced or separated parents, earlier, Support claimed under a multiple support agreement next, and Kidnapped child under Qualifying Relative in Pub. 501, Dependents, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information. Support claimed under a multiple support agreement. If you are considered to have provided more than half of a qualifying relative's support under a multiple support agreement, you can include medical expenses you pay for that person. A multiple support agreement is used when two or more people provide more than half of a person's support, but no one alone provides more than half. Any medical expenses paid by others who joined you in the agreement can't be included as medical expenses by anyone. However, you can include the entire unreimbursed amount you paid for medical expenses. Example. You and your three siblings each provide one-fourth of your parent's total support. Under a multiple support agreement, you treat your parent as your dependent. You paid all of your parent's medical expenses. Your siblings repaid you for three-fourths of these expenses. In figuring your medical expense deduction, you can include only one-fourth of your parent's medical expenses. Your siblings can't include any part of the expenses. However, if you and your siblings share the nonmedical support items and you separately pay all of your parent's medical expenses, you can include the unreimbursed amount you paid for your parent's medical expenses in your medical expenses. Decedent Medical expenses paid before death by the decedent are included in figuring any deduction for medical and dental expenses on the decedent's final income tax return. This includes expenses for the decedent's spouse and dependents as well as for the decedent. The survivor or personal representative of a decedent can choose to treat certain expenses paid by the decedent's estate for the decedent's medical care as paid by the decedent at the time the medical services were provided. The expenses must be paid within the 1-year period beginning with the day after the date of death. If you are the survivor or personal representative making this choice, you must attach a statement to the decedent's Form 1040 or 1040-SR (or the decedent's amended return, Form 1040-X) saying that the expenses haven't been and won't be claimed on the estate tax return. . Qualified medical expenses paid before death by the decedent aren't deductible if paid with a tax-free distribution from any Archer MSA, Medicare Advantage MSA, or health savings account. . What if the decedent's return had been filed and the medical expenses weren't included? Form 1040-X can be filed for the year or years the expenses are treated as paid, unless the period for claiming a refund has passed. Generally, a claim for refund must be filed within 3 years of the date the original return was filed, or within 2 years from the time the tax was paid, whichever date is later. Example. Taxpayer J properly filed a 2021 income tax return. J died in 2022 with unpaid medical expenses of $1,500 from 2021 and $1,800 in 2022. If the expenses are paid within the 1-year period, J's survivor or personal representative can file an amended return for 2021 claiming a deduction based on the $1,500 medical expenses. The $1,800 of medical expenses from 2022 can be included on the decedent's final return for 2022. What if you pay medical expenses of a deceased spouse or dependent? If you paid medical expenses for your deceased spouse or dependent, include them as medical expenses on your Schedule A (Form 1040) in the year paid, whether they are paid before or after the decedent's death. The expenses can be included if the person was your spouse or dependent either at the time the medical services were provided or at the time you paid the expenses. What Medical Expenses Are Includible? Following is a list of items that you can include in figuring your medical expense deduction. The items are listed in alphabetical order. This list doesn't include all possible medical expenses. To determine if an expense not listed can be included in figuring your medical expense deduction, see What Are Medical Expenses, earlier. Abortion You can include in medical expenses the amount you pay for a legal abortion. Acupuncture You can include in medical expenses the amount you pay for acupuncture. Alcoholism You can include in medical expenses amounts you pay for an inpatient's treatment at a therapeutic center for alcohol addiction. This includes meals and lodging provided by the center during treatment. You can also include in medical expenses amounts you pay for transportation to and from alcohol recovery support organization (for example, Alcoholics Anonymous) meetings in your community if the attendance is pursuant to competent medical advice that membership in the alcohol recovery support organization is necessary for the treatment of a disease involving the excessive use of alcohol. Ambulance You can include in medical expenses amounts you pay for ambulance service. Annual Physical Examination See Physical Examination, later. Artificial Limb You can include in medical expenses the amount you pay for an artificial limb. Artificial Teeth You can include in medical expenses the amount you pay for artificial teeth. Bandages You can include in medical expenses the cost of medical supplies such as bandages.

Braille Books and Magazines You can include in medical expenses the part of the cost of Braille books and magazines for use by a visually impaired person that is more than the cost of regular printed editions. Breast Pumps and Supplies You can include in medical expenses the cost of breast pumps and supplies that assist lactation. This doesn't include the costs of excess bottles for food storage. Breast Reconstruction Surgery You can include in medical expenses the amounts you pay for breast reconstruction surgery, as well as breast prosthesis, following a mastectomy for cancer. See Cosmetic Surgery, later. Capital Expenses You can include in medical expenses amounts you pay for special equipment installed in a home, or for improvements, if their main purpose is medical care for you, your spouse, or your dependent. The cost of permanent improvements that increase the value of your property may be partly included as a medical expense. The cost of the improvement is reduced by the increase in the value of your property. The difference is a medical expense. If the value of your property isn't increased by the improvement, the entire cost is included as a medical expense. Certain improvements made to accommodate a home to your disabled condition, or that of your spouse or your dependents who live with you, don't usually increase the value of the home and the cost can be included in full as medical expenses. These improvements include, but aren't limited to, the following items. Constructing entrance or exit ramps for your home. Widening doorways at entrances or exits to your home. Widening or otherwise modifying hallways and interior doorways. Installing railings, support bars, or other modifications to bathrooms. Lowering or modifying kitchen cabinets and equipment. Moving or modifying electrical outlets and fixtures. Installing porch lifts and other forms of lifts (but elevators generally add value to the house). Modifying fire alarms, smoke detectors, and other warning systems. Modifying stairways. Adding handrails or grab bars anywhere (whether or not in bathrooms). Modifying hardware on doors. Modifying areas in front of entrance and exit doorways. Grading the ground to provide access to the residence. Only reasonable costs to accommodate a home to your disabled condition are considered medical care. Additional costs for personal motives, such as for architectural or aesthetic reasons, aren't medical expenses. Capital expense worksheet. Use Worksheet A to figure the amount of your capital expense to include in your medical expenses. Worksheet A. Capital Expense Worksheet Instructions: Use this worksheet to figure the amount, if any, of your medical expenses due to a home improvement. 1. Enter the amount you paid for the home improvement 1. _____ 2. Enter the value of your home immediately after the improvement 2. _____ 3. Enter the value of your home immediately before the improvement 3. _____ 4. Subtract line 3 from line 2. This is the increase in the value of your home due to the improvement 4. _____ If line 4 is more than or equal to line 1, you have no medical expenses due to the home improvement; stop here. If line 4 is less than line 1, go to line 5. 5. Subtract line 4 from line 1. These are your medical expenses due to the home improvement 5. _____ Operation and upkeep. Amounts you pay for operation and upkeep of a capital asset qualify as medical expenses as long as the main reason for them is medical care. This rule applies even if none or only part of the original cost of the capital asset qualified as a medical care expense. Improvements to property rented by a person with a disability. Amounts paid to buy and install special plumbing fixtures for a person with a disability, mainly for medical reasons, in a rented house are medical expenses. Example. Taxpayer B has arthritis and a heart condition. B can't climb stairs or get into a bathtub. On the doctor's advice, B installs a bathroom with a shower stall on the first floor of B's two-story rented house. The landlord didn't pay any of the cost of buying and installing the special plumbing and didn't lower the rent. B can include in medical expenses the entire amount B paid. Car You can include in medical expenses the cost of special hand controls and other special equipment installed in a car for the use of a person with a disability. Special design. You can include in medical expenses the difference between the cost of a regular car and a car specially designed to hold a wheelchair. Cost of operation. The includible costs of using a car for medical reasons are explained under Transportation, later. Chiropractor You can include in medical expenses fees you pay to a chiropractor for medical care. Christian Science Practitioner You can include in medical expenses fees you pay to Christian Science practitioners for medical care. Contact Lenses You can include in medical expenses amounts you pay for contact lenses needed for medical reasons. You can also include the cost of equipment and materials required for using contact lenses, such as saline solution and enzyme cleaner. See Eyeglasses and Eye Surgery, later. Crutches You can include in medical expenses the amount you pay to buy or rent crutches. Dental Treatment You can include in medical expenses the amounts you pay for the prevention and alleviation of dental disease. Preventive treatment includes the services of a dental hygienist or dentist for such procedures as teeth cleaning, the application of sealants, and fluoride treatments to prevent tooth decay. Treatment to alleviate dental disease includes services of a dentist for procedures such as X-rays, fillings, braces, extractions, dentures, and other dental ailments. But see Teeth Whitening under What Expenses Aren't Includible, later. Diagnostic Devices You can include in medical expenses the cost of devices used in diagnosing and treating illness and disease. Example. You have diabetes and use a blood sugar test kit to monitor your blood sugar level. You can include the cost of the blood sugar test kit in your medical expenses. Disabled Dependent Care Expenses Some disabled dependent care expenses may qualify as either: Medical expenses, or Work-related expenses for purposes of taking a credit for dependent care. See Pub. 503, Child and Dependent Care Expenses. You can choose to apply them either way as long as you don't use the same expenses to claim both a credit and a medical expense deduction. Drug Addiction You can include in medical expenses amounts you pay for an inpatient's treatment at a therapeutic center for drug addiction. This includes meals and lodging provided by the center during treatment. You can also include in medical expenses amounts you pay for transportation to and from drug treatment meetings in your community if the attendance is pursuant to competent medical advice that the membership is necessary for the treatment of a disease involving the excessive use of drugs. Drugs See Medicines, later. Eye Exam You can include in medical expenses the amount you pay for eye examinations. Eyeglasses You can include in medical expenses amounts you pay for eyeglasses and contact lenses needed for medical reasons. See Contact Lenses, earlier, for more information. Eye Surgery You can include in medical expenses the amount you pay for eye surgery to treat defective vision, such as laser eye surgery or radial keratotomy. Fertility Enhancement You can include in medical expenses the cost of the following procedures performed on yourself, your spouse, or your dependent to overcome an inability to have children. Procedures such as in vitro fertilization (including temporary storage of eggs or sperm). Surgery, including an operation to reverse prior surgery that prevented the person operated on from having children. Founder's Fee See Lifetime Care\u2014Advance Payments, later. Guide Dog or Other Service Animal You can include in medical expenses the costs of buying, training, and maintaining a guide dog or other service animal to assist a visually impaired or hearing disabled person, or a person with other physical disabilities. In general, this includes any costs, such as food, grooming, and veterinary care, incurred in maintaining the health and vitality of the service animal so that it may perform its duties. Health Institute You can include in medical expenses fees you pay for treatment at a health institute only if the treatment is prescribed by a physician and the physician issues a statement that the treatment is necessary to alleviate a physical or mental disability or illness of the individual receiving the treatment. Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) You can include in medical expenses amounts you pay to entitle you, your spouse, or a dependent to receive medical care from an HMO. These amounts are treated as medical insurance premiums. See Insurance Premiums, later. Hearing Aids You can include in medical expenses the cost of a hearing aid and batteries, repairs, and maintenance needed to operate it. Home Care See Nursing Services, later. Home Improvements See Capital Expenses, earlier. Hospital Services You can include in medical expenses amounts you pay for the cost of inpatient care at a hospital or similar institution if a principal reason for being there is to receive medical care. This includes amounts paid for meals and lodging. Also see Lodging, later. Insurance Premiums You can include in medical expenses insurance premiums you pay for policies that cover medical care. You can't include in medical expenses insurance premiums that were paid and for which you are claiming a credit or deduction. Medical care policies can provide payment for treatment that includes: Hospitalization, surgical services, X-rays; Prescription drugs and insulin; Dental care; Replacement of lost or damaged contact lenses; and Long-term care (subject to additional limitations). See Qualified Long-Term Care Insurance Contracts under Long-Term Care, later. If you have a policy that provides payments for other than medical care, you can include the premiums for the medical care part of the policy if the charge for the medical part is reasonable. The cost of the medical part must be separately stated in the insurance contract or given to you in a separate statement. Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance Plan Don't include in your medical and dental expenses any insurance premiums paid by an employer-sponsored health insurance plan unless the premiums are included on your Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement. Also, don't include any other medical and dental expenses paid by the plan unless the amount paid is included on your Form W-2. Example. You are a federal employee participating in the premium conversion plan of the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) program. Your share of the FEHB premium is paid by making a pre-tax reduction in your salary. Because you are an employee whose insurance premiums are paid with money that is never included in your gross income, you can't deduct the premiums paid with that money. Long-term care services. Contributions made by your employer to provide coverage for qualified long-term care services under a flexible spending or similar arrangement must be included in your income. This amount will be reported as wages on your Form W-2. Retired public safety officers. If you are a retired public safety officer, don't include as medical expenses any health or long-term care insurance premiums that you elected to have paid with tax-free distributions from a retirement plan. This applies only to distributions that would otherwise be included in income. Health reimbursement arrangement (HRA). If you have medical expenses that are reimbursed by a health reimbursement arrangement, you can't include those expenses in your medical expenses. Medicare Part A If you are covered under social security (or if you are a government employee who paid Medicare tax), you are enrolled in Medicare Part A. The payroll tax paid for Medicare Part A isn't a medical expense. If you aren't covered under social security (or weren't a government employee who paid Medicare tax), you can voluntarily enroll in Medicare Part A.

For 2022, the standard medical mileage rate allowed is 18 cents a mile from January 1, 2022, through June 30, 2022, and 22 cents a mile from July 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022.

In 2022, Taxpayer J drove 2,800 miles (1,500 miles before June 30, 2022, and 1,300 miles after July 1, 2022) for medical reasons. J spent $400 for gas, $30 for oil, and $100 for tolls and parking. J wants to figure the amount to include in medical expenses both ways to see which gives the greater deduction. J figures the actual expenses first. J adds the $400 for gas, the $30 for oil, and the $100 for tolls and parking for a total of $530. J then figures the standard mileage amount. J multiplies 1,500 miles by 18 cents a mile for a total of $270. J multiplies 1,300 miles by 22 cents a mile for a total of $286. J then adds the total $100 tolls and parking and mileage for a total of $656 (270 + 286 + 100).

If you are reimbursed more than your medical expenses, you may have to include the excess in income. You may want to use Figure 1 to help you decide if any of your reimbursement is taxable. Reimbursement Taxable? Figure 1. Is Your Excess Medical Reimbursement Taxable? Figure 1. Is Your Excess Medical Reimbursement Taxable? Summary: This flowchart is used to determine if any reimbursements you receive for your medical expenses is taxable. Start This is the starting of the flowchart.

Footnote: See Premiums paid by you and your employer. Continue To End End This is the ending of the flowchart. Please click here for the text description of the image. Premiums paid by you. If you pay either the entire premium for your medical insurance or all the costs of a plan similar to medical insurance and your insurance payments or other reimbursements are more than your total medical expenses for the year, you have excess reimbursement. Generally, you don't include the excess reimbursement in your gross income. However, gross income does include total payments in excess of $390 a day ($142,350 for 2022) for qualified long-term care services. Premiums paid by you and your employer. If both you and your employer contribute to your medical insurance plan and your employer's contributions aren't included in your gross income, you must include in your gross income the part of your excess reimbursement that is from your employer's contribution. If you aren't covered by more than one policy, you can figure the amount of the excess reimbursement you must include in gross income using Worksheet B. If you are covered under more than one policy, see More than one policy, later. Worksheet B. Excess Reimbursement Includible in Income When You Have Only One Policy Instructions: Use this worksheet to figure the amount of excess reimbursement you must include in income when both you and your employer contributed to your medical insurance and your employer's contributions aren't included in your gross income. 1. Enter the amount contributed to your medical insurance for the year by your employer 1. _____ 2. Enter the total annual cost of the policy 2. _____ 3. Divide line 1 by line 2 3. _____ 4. Enter the amount of excess reimbursement 4. _____ 5. Multiply line 3 by line 4. This is the amount of the excess reimburse- ment you must include as other income on Form 1040 or 1040-SR 5. _____ Premiums paid by your employer. If your employer or your former employer pays the total cost of your medical insurance plan and your employer's contributions aren't included in your income, you must report all of your excess reimbursement as other income. More than one policy. If you are covered under more than one policy, the cost of at least one of which is paid by both you and your employer, you must first divide the medical expenses among the policies to figure the excess reimbursement from each policy. Then divide the policy costs to figure the part of any excess reimbursement that is from your employer's contribution. Any excess reimbursement that is due to your employer's contributions is includible in your income. You can figure the part of the excess reimbursement that is from your employer's contribution by using Worksheet C. Use Worksheet C only if both you and your employer paid part of the cost of at least one policy. If you had more than one policy, but you didn't share in the cost of at least one policy, don't use Worksheet C. Worksheet C. Excess Reimbursement Includible in Income When You Have More Than One Policy Instructions: Use this worksheet to figure the amount of excess reimbursement you must include as income on your tax return when (a) you are reimbursed under two or more health insurance policies, (b) at least one of which is paid for by both you and your employer, and (c) your employer's contributions aren't included in your gross income. If you and your employer didn't share in the cost of at least one policy, don't use this worksheet. 1. Enter the reimbursement from your employer's policy 1. _____ 2. Enter the reimbursement from your own policy 2. _____ 3. Add lines 1 and 2 3. _____ 4. Divide line 1 by line 3 4. _____ 5. Enter the total medical expenses you paid during the year. If this amount is at least as much as the amount on line 3, stop here because there is no excess reimbursement 5. _____ 6. Multiply line 4 by line 5 6. _____ 7. Subtract line 6 from line 1 7. _____ 8. Enter employer's contribution to the annual cost of the employer's policy 8. _____ 9. Enter total annual cost of the employer's policy 9. _____ 10. Divide line 8 by line 9. This is the percentage of your total excess reimbursement you must report as other income 10. _____ 11. Multiply line 7 by line 10. This is the amount of your total excess reimbursement you must report as other income on Form 1040 or 1040-SR 11. _____ What if You Receive Insurance Reimbursement in a Later Year? If you are reimbursed in a later year for medical expenses you deducted in an earlier year, you must generally report the reimbursement as income up to the amount you previously deducted as medical expenses. However, don't report as income the amount of reimbursement you received up to the amount of your medical deductions that didn't reduce your tax for the earlier year. For more information about the recovery of an amount that you claimed as an itemized deduction in an earlier year, see Recoveries in Pub. 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income. What if You Are Reimbursed for Medical Expenses You Didn't Deduct? If you didn't deduct a medical expense in the year you paid it because your medical expenses weren't more than 7.5% of your AGI or because you didn't itemize deductions, don't include the reimbursement, up to the amount of the expense, in income. However, if the reimbursement is more than the expense, see What if Your Insurance Reimbursement Is More Than Your Medical Expenses, earlier. How Do You Figure and Report the Deduction on Your Tax Return? Once you have determined which medical expenses you can include, figure and report the deduction on your tax return. What Tax Form Do You Use? You report your medical expense deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040). See the Instructions for Schedule A (Form 1040) for more detailed information on figuring your medical and dental expense deduction. . Recordkeeping. You should keep records of your medical and dental expenses to support your deduction. Don't send these records with your paper return.. Sale of Medical Equipment or Property If you deduct the cost of medical equipment or property in one year and sell it in a later year, you may have a taxable gain. The taxable gain is the amount of the selling price that is more than the adjusted basis of the equipment or property. The adjusted basis is the portion of the cost of the equipment or property that you couldn't deduct because of the 7.5% or 10% AGI limit used to figure your medical deduction. Refer to your Schedule A for the year the cost was included to determine which limit applied to you. Use Worksheet D to figure the adjusted basis of the equipment or property. Worksheet D. Adjusted Basis of Medical Equipment or Property Sold Instructions: Use this worksheet if you deducted the cost of medical equipment or property in one year and sold the equipment or property in a later year. This worksheet will give you the adjusted basis of the equipment or property you sold. 1. Enter the cost of the equipment or property 1. _____ 2. Enter your total includible medical expenses for the year you included the cost in your medical expenses 2. _____ 3. Divide line 1 by line 2 3. _____ 4. Enter 7.5% or 10% of your AGI (whichever applies) for the year the cost was included in your medical expenses 4. _____ 5. Multiply line 3 by line 4. If your allowable itemized deductions for the year you purchased the equipment or property weren't more than your AGI for that year, stop here. This is the adjusted basis of the equipment or property. If your allowable itemized deductions for the year you purchased the equipment or property were more than your AGI for that year, complete lines 6 through 11 5. _____ 6. Subtract line 5 from line 1 6. _____ 7. Enter your total allowable itemized deductions for the year the cost was included in your medical expenses 7. _____ 8. Divide line 6 by line 7 8. _____ 9. Enter your AGI for the year the cost was included in your medical expenses 9. _____ 10. Subtract line 9 from line 7 10. _____ 11. Multiply line 8 by line 10 11. _____ 12. Add line 5 to line 11. If your allowable itemized deductions for the year you purchased the equipment or property were more than your AGI for that year, this is the adjusted basis of the equipment or property 12. _____ Next, use Worksheet E to figure the total gain or loss on the sale of the medical equipment or property. Worksheet E. Gain or Loss on the Sale of Medical Equipment or Property Instructions: Use the following worksheet to figure total gain or loss on the sale of medical equipment or property that you deducted in an earlier year. 1. Enter the amount that the medical equipment or property sold for 1. _____ 2. Enter your selling expenses 2. _____ 3. Subtract line 2 from line 1 3. _____ 4. Enter the adjusted basis of the equipment or property from Worksheet D, line 5, or line 12, if applicable 4. _____ 5. Subtract line 4 from line 3. This is the total gain or loss from the sale of the medical equipment or property 5. _____ If you have a loss, it isn't deductible. If you have a gain, it is includible in your income. The part of the gain that is a recovery of an amount you previously deducted is taxable as ordinary income. Enter it on Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Any part of the gain that is more than the recovery of an amount you previously deducted is taxable as a capital gain. Enter it on Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets, and Schedule D (Form 1040), Capital Gains and Losses. For more information about the recovery of an amount that you claimed as an itemized deduction in an earlier year, see Recoveries in Pub. 525. Damages for Personal Injuries If you receive an amount in settlement of a personal injury suit, part of that award may be for medical expenses that you deducted in an earlier year. If it is, you must include that part in your income in the year you receive it to the extent it reduced your taxable income in the earlier year. See What if You Receive Insurance Reimbursement in a Later Year, discussed earlier under How Do You Treat Reimbursements. Example. You sued this year for injuries you suffered in an accident last year. You sought $10,000 for your injuries and didn't itemize your damages. Last year, you paid $500 for medical expenses for your injuries. You deducted those expenses on last year's tax return. This year you settled your lawsuit for $2,000. Your settlement didn't itemize or allocate the damages. The $2,000 is first presumed to be for the medical expenses that you deducted. The $500 is includible in your income this year because you deducted the entire $500 as a medical expense deduction last year. Future medical expenses. If you receive an amount in settlement of a damage suit for personal injuries, part of that award may be for future medical expenses. If it is, you must reduce any future medical expenses for these injuries until the amount you received has been completely used. Example. You were injured in an accident. You sued and sought a judgment of $50,000 for your injuries. You settled the suit for $45,000. The settlement provided that $10,000 of the $45,000 was for future medical expenses for your injuries. You can't include the first $10,000 that you pay for medical expenses for those injuries. Workers' compensation. If you received workers' compensation and you deducted medical expenses related to that injury, you must include the workers' compensation in income up to the amount you deducted. If you received workers' compensation, but didn't deduct medical expenses related to that injury, don't include the workers' compensation in your income. Impairment-Related Work Expenses If you are a person with disabilities, you can take a business deduction for expenses that are necessary for you to be able to work. If you take a business deduction for these impairment-related work expenses, they aren't subject to the 7.5% limit that applies to medical expenses. You have a disability if you have: A physical or mental disability (for example, blindness or deafness) that functionally limits your being employed; or A physical or mental impairment (for example, a sight or hearing impairment) that substantially limits one or more of your major life activities, such as performing manual tasks, walking, speaking, breathing, learning, or working. Impairment-related expenses defined. Impairment-related expenses are those ordinary and necessary business expenses that are: Necessary for you to do your work satisfactorily; For goods and services not required or used, other than incidentally, in your personal activities; and Not specifically covered under other income tax laws. Where to report. If you are self-employed, deduct the business expenses on the appropriate form (Schedule C, E, or F) used to report your business income and expenses. If you are an employee, complete Form 2106, Employee Business Expenses. Enter on Schedule A (Form 1040) that part of the amount on Form 2106 that is related to your impairment. Example. You are blind. You must use a reader to do your work. You use the reader both during your regular working hours at your place of work and outside your regular working hours away from your place of work. The reader's services are only for your work. You can deduct your expenses for the reader as business expenses. Health Insurance Costs for Self-Employed Persons If you were self-employed and had a net profit for the year, you may be able to deduct, as an adjustment to income, amounts paid for medical and qualified long-term care insurance on behalf of yourself, your spouse, your dependents, and your children who were under age 27 at the end of 2022. For this purpose, you were self-employed if you were a general partner (or a limited partner receiving guaranteed payments) or you received wages from an S corporation in which you were more than a 2% shareholder. The insurance plan must be established under your trade or business and the deduction can't be more than your earned income from that trade or business. You can't deduct payments for medical insurance for any month in which you were eligible to participate in a health plan subsidized by your employer, your spouse's employer, or an employer of your dependent, or your child under age 27, at the end of 2022. You can't deduct payments for a qualified long-term care insurance contract for any month in which you were eligible to participate in a long-term care insurance plan subsidized by your employer or your spouse's employer. If you qualify to take the deduction, use the Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction Worksheet in the Instructions for Form 1040 to figure the amount you can deduct. But if any of the following applies, don't use that worksheet. You had more than one source of income subject to self-employment tax. You file Form 2555, Foreign Earned Income. You are using amounts paid for qualified long-term care insurance to figure the deduction. If you can't use the worksheet in the Instructions for Form 1040, use the worksheet in Pub. 535, Business Expenses, to figure your deduction. Use Pub. 974, Premium Tax Credit, instead of the worksheet in the 2022 Instructions for Form 1040 if the insurance plan established, or considered to be established, under your business was obtained through the Health Insurance Marketplace and you are claiming the premium tax credit. When figuring the amount you can deduct for insurance premiums, don't include amounts paid for health insurance coverage with retirement plan distributions that were tax free because you are a retired public safety officer. Where to report. You take this deduction on Form 1040 or 1040-SR. If you itemize your deductions and don't claim 100% of your self-employed health insurance costs on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, include any remaining premiums with all other medical expenses on Schedule A (Form 1040) subject to the 7.5% limit. Child under age 27. If the insurance policy covers your nondependent child who was under age 27 at the end of 2022, you can claim the premiums for that coverage on Form 1040 or 1040-SR. If you can't claim 100% of your self-employed health insurance costs on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, any excess amounts attributable to that child aren't eligible to be claimed on Schedule A (Form 1040). Generally, family health insurance premiums don't increase if coverage for an additional child is added. If this is the situation, no allocation would be necessary. If the premiums did increase (such as where coverage was expanded from single to family to add the nondependent child), you can allocate the amount on Form 1040 or 1040-SR to the nondependent child and any excess amounts not attributable to that child would be eligible to be claimed on Schedule A. Example 1. Taxpayer Z is self-employed in 2022 and has self-only coverage for health insurance. Z's premium for that coverage was $5,000 for the year. Z changes to family coverage only to add Z's 26-year-old nondependent child to the plan. Z's health insurance premium increases to $10,000 for the year. After completing the Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction Worksheet in the Instructions for Form 1040, Z can only deduct $4,000 on Form 1040 or 1040-SR. The $4,000 is allocable to the nondependent child. Z can only claim the $5,000 allocable to Z's coverage on Schedule A. The $1,000 excess premiums allocable to the nondependent child can't be claimed by Z. Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that Z had family coverage when Z added the 26-year-old nondependent child to the policy. There was no increase in the $10,000 premium. In this case, Z could claim $4,000 on Form 1040 or 1040-SR and $6,000 on Schedule A. More information. For more information, see Pub. 535.
