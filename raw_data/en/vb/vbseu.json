Due to the high global burden of cancer, these countries are also experiencing an expansion of western conventional cancer care. It is important to consider the prevalence of reported TCAM use among cancer pati ents in LI and LMI countries, and the proportion who report combini ng TCAM with conventional cancer care. The objective of this review is to 1.) summarize the available prevalence data on traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine by cancer patients in LI and LMI countries, and 2.) stratify the prevalence data by world region and country income level. Methods: A literature search for cancer, TCAM, and LI and LMI countries was conducted acro ss 5 databases. A total of 2,365 studies were reviewed and filtered into 1 of 5 sub categories depending on study topic and inclusion/exclusion criteria. After abstract and full -text review, the prevalence subcategory contained 23 studies that met inclusion criteria. Prevalence data was extracted and summarized. Results : The studies included data from 13 different countries, 2 (15.4%) low -income countries and 11 (85.6%) lower -middle income countries. The combin ed sample size across all 23 studies was 6,434, with a median of 55.0% reporting the use of TCAM for their cancer care . Of the studies that p rovided data on the concomitant use of TCAM and conventional cancer treatment (n=5,056 ), a median of 32.7% of participants reported combining the two systems of medicine. Conclusion : There is a significant paucity of data on the use of TCAM by cancer patients in LI and LMI countries. Of the data obtained, it is apparent that TCAM use among cancer patients in LI and LMI countries is common, and roughly 1/3 of patients report using TCAM with conventional medicine for cancer. There is a substantial need f or additional studies to provide further insight on the use of TCAM among cancer patients and support the safe and effective integration of TCAM and conventional cancer care for patients in LI and LMI countries.
