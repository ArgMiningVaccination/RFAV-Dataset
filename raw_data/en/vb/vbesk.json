[Science & Tech](/Science-Tech) - Related Topics: - [observation](/science/observation) natural experiment, observational study in which an event or a situation that allows for the random or seemingly random assignment of study subjects to different groups is exploited to answer a particular question. Natural experiments are often used to study situations in which controlled experimentation is not possible, such as when an exposure of interest cannot be practically or ethically assigned to research subjects. Situations that may create appropriate circumstances for a natural experiment include policy changes, [weather](https://www.britannica.com/science/weather) events, and natural disasters. Natural experiments are used most commonly in the fields of [epidemiology](https://www.britannica.com/science/epidemiology), [political science](https://www.britannica.com/topic/political-science), [psychology](https://www.britannica.com/science/psychology), and [social science](https://www.britannica.com/topic/social-science). Comparison with controlled study design Key features of experimental study design include manipulation and control. Manipulation, in this [context](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/context), means that the experimenter can control which research subjects receive which exposures. For instance, subjects randomized to the treatment arm of an experiment typically receive treatment with the drug or therapy that is the focus of the experiment, while those in the [control group](https://www.britannica.com/science/control-group) receive no treatment or a different treatment. Control is most readily accomplished through random assignment, which means that the procedures by which participants are assigned to a treatment and control condition ensure that each has equal probability of assignment to either group. Random assignment ensures that individual characteristics or experiences that might confound the treatment results are, on average, evenly distributed between the two groups. In this way, at least one variable can be manipulated, and units are randomly assigned to the different levels or categories of the manipulated variables. In epidemiology, the [gold standard](https://www.britannica.com/money/topic/gold-standard) in research design generally is considered to be the randomized control trial (RCT). RCTs, however, can answer only certain types of epidemiologic questions, and they are not useful in the investigation of questions for which random assignment is either impracticable or unethical. The bulk of epidemiologic research relies on observational data, which raises issues in drawing causal [inferences](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inferences) from the results. A core assumption for drawing causal [inference](https://www.britannica.com/science/inference-statistics) is that the average outcome of the group exposed to one treatment [regimen](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/regimen) represents the average outcome the other group would have had if they had been exposed to the same treatment regimen. If treatment is not randomly assigned, as in the case of observational studies, the assumption that the two groups are exchangeable (on both known and unknown confounders) cannot be assumed to be true. As an example, suppose that an investigator is interested in the effect of poor housing on health. Because it is neither practical nor [ethical](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethical) to randomize people to variable housing conditions, this subject is difficult to study using an experimental approach. However, if a housing policy change, such as a lottery for subsidized mortgages, was enacted that enabled some people to move to more desirable housing while leaving other similar people in their previous substandard housing, it might be possible to use that policy change to study the effect of housing change on health outcomes. In another example, a well-known natural experiment in [Helena](https://www.britannica.com/place/Helena-Montana), Montana, [smoking](https://www.britannica.com/topic/smoking-tobacco) was banned from all public places for a six-month period. Investigators later reported a 60-percent drop in [heart attacks](https://www.britannica.com/science/heart-attack) for the study area during the time the ban was in effect. Natural experiments as quasi experiments Because natural experiments do not randomize participants into exposure groups, the assumptions and [analytical](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/analytical) techniques customarily applied to experimental designs are not valid for them. Rather, natural experiments are quasi experiments and must be thought about and analyzed as such. The lack of random assignment means multiple threats to causal [inference](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inference), including [attrition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/attrition), history, testing, [regression](https://www.britannica.com/topic/regression-statistics), instrumentation, and maturation, may influence observed study outcomes. For this reason, natural experiments will never unequivocally determine causation in a given situation. Nevertheless, they are a useful method for researchers, and if used with care they can provide additional data that may help with a research question and that may not be obtainable in any other way. Instrumental variables The major limitation in inferring causation from natural experiments is the presence of unmeasured confounding. One class of methods designed to control confounding and [measurement](https://www.britannica.com/technology/measurement) error is based on instrumental variables (IV). While useful in a variety of applications, the validity and interpretation of IV estimates depend on strong assumptions, the plausibility of which must be considered with regard to the causal relation in question. In particular, IV analyses depend on the assumption that subjects were effectively randomized, even if the randomization was accidental (in the case of an administrative policy change or exposure to a natural disaster) and [adherence](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adherence) to random assignment was low. IV methods can be used to control for confounding in observational studies, to control for confounding due to noncompliance, and to correct for misclassification. IV analysis, however, can produce serious biases in effect estimates. It can also be difficult to identify the particular subpopulation to which the causal effect IV estimate applies. Moreover, IV analysis can add considerable imprecision to causal effect estimates. Small sample size poses an additional challenge in applying IV methods. "}
