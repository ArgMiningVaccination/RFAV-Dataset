Let's Separate Fact From Fiction Every year before influenza itself arrives to circulate, misinformation and misconceptions about the flu vaccine begin circulating. Some of these contain a grain of truth but end up distorted, like a whispered secret in the Telephone game. But if you're looking for an excuse not to get the flu vaccine, last year's numbers of its effectiveness would seem a convincing argument on their own. By all measures, last season's flu vaccine flopped, clocking in at about 23 percent effectiveness in preventing lab-confirmed influenza infections. But that's not the whole story, said Lisa Grohskopf, a medical officer in the influenza division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Twenty-three is better than zero, but the 23 percent was overall. If you were one of the people who got an influenza B strain, it was closer to 60 percent,\" she said. \"Even if it's not going to work against one virus very well, there are other viruses circulating.\" Each year's flu vaccine contains three (trivalent) or four (quadrivalent) strains of the flu, selected in February by the [World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/2015_16_north/en/) and then [endorsed](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2015/03/fda-panel-endorses-who-picks-2015-16-flu-vaccine) by the [Food and Drug Administration](http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/BloodVaccinesandOtherBiologics/VaccinesandRelatedBiologicalProductsAdvisoryCommittee/ucm436058.htm), as the ones experts expect will circulate in the coming flu season. They choose one H1N1 strain, one H3N2 strain and one B virus strain, either from the Yamagata lineage or the Victoria lineage. Quadrivalent vaccines contain a B strain from each lineage. \"Viruses in the Yamagata lineage or in the Victoria lineage are different enough that there's not a lot of cross-protection,\" Grohskopf said. \"So if, say, we have a vaccine that contains a Yamagata family virus one season and it ends up being a predominantly Victoria season, we might not get very good protection against B strains.\" But sometimes the experts' predictions are off the mark, and sometimes a strain they select mutates before the season arrives. Last year, the H3N2 strain they chose was a poor match, and that strain dominated the season, though B viruses became more common toward the end, Grohskopf said. Adjustments were made in the vaccine for the H3N2 virus this year. \"There's definitely reason to be hopeful that it's going to be better this year, but it's a little too early to tell,\" Grohskopf said. \"Flu seasons can be very variable in terms of how fast they take off, but right now activity is still fairly light.\" The [flu vaccine options](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/vaccines.htm) this year haven't changed much from last year, with two exceptions. The [recombinant flu vaccine](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/qa_flublok-vaccine.htm), made without the virus and without eggs, is now approved for all adults age 18 and older (instead of just those ages 18 to 49). And the intradermal vaccine, a low-dose vaccine that uses a shorter needle and injects only into the skin, is now available as a quadrivalent vaccine instead of just trivalent. The CDC does not recommend any one vaccine over another. \"We really just think it's important that people get vaccinated, and depending on where you are, you may not be able to get a particular product,\" Grohskopf said. \"We don't want to hunt for one thing and then not get vaccinated until it's too late and flu is already peaking for the season.\" Getting vaccinated against flu is particularly important for several at-risk groups and people in frequent, close contact with those at-risk groups, Grohskopf said. The populations at the highest risk of serious complications from the flu include pregnant women, people age 50 and older and children under age 5, particularly under age 2, she said. Anyone with a chronic medical condition, such as lung disease, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease or a neurological condition also has a higher risk of serious complications with an influenza infection. Those at risk of infecting more vulnerable people include parents of young children, day care workers, teachers, caretakers of elderly individuals and anyone working in health care. But the problem with limiting flu immunization to these groups, she said, is that the flu is a tricky bug \u2014 and unpredictable. \"While some people are definitely at higher risk for severe disease if they get the flu, sometimes even generally healthy, young people \u2014 older children, younger adults who are the most hardy folks if they don't have any other chronic illnesses \u2014 can get really sick, hospitalized and even die, and we can't really predict who those folks are going to be,\" Grohskopf said. \"The majority of people who get the flu are going to feel really crummy for a time and then recover without any problems.\" But even those folks lose work time and risk spreading the disease to family members and others, she said. Another monkey wrench this year is additional evidence, [reported at Stat](http://www.statnews.com/2015/11/11/flu-shots-reduce-effectiveness/), that getting a flu shot every year might reduce its effectiveness in warding off the flu. This [evidence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC24180/) isn't [entirely new](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24235265), and scientists still don't entirely understand it, but it also doesn't mean that skipping the flu shot this year is wise if you got it last year. In the meantime, for those who still haven't gotten the vaccine this year, make sure it's not because of one of the concerns below.
