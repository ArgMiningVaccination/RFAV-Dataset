STOCRIN belongs to a group of medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It works by interrupting the formation of new HIV particles in already infected cells. When HIV is attacked by STOCRIN, the virus is not able to reproduce normally. This helps reduce the amount of virus in the blood. Although STOCRIN helps reduce the amount of virus in the blood and thus increases the CD4 count, it has not yet been shown to improve survival or slow the progression of the disease. STOCRIN is used to help treat HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection. It is used in combination with other appropriate medicines used to treat the HIV virus. Examples include protease inhibitors such as indinavir (Crixivan*) and nelfinavir (Viracept*). They also include nucleoside such as zidovudine (AZT, Retrovir*) or lamivudine (3TC). You may continue to develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV disease while you are taking STOCRIN 2. What should I know before I use STOCRIN? Warnings Do not use STOCRIN if: - you have an allergy to STOCRIN or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet - the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering - the expiry date on the pack has passed. If you take this medicine after the expiry date has passed, it may not work. - you are breast feeding or plan to breast feed.

QTc Prolongation has been observed with the use of efavirenz. Your doctor may give you an alternative antiretroviral. Pregnancy Check with your doctor if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. If there is a need to take STOCRIN when you are pregnant, your doctor will discuss the possible risks and benefits to you and the unborn baby. Women taking STOCRIN should avoid pregnancy during treatment and for 12 weeks after they've stopped taking treatment. Use barrier contraception even if you are using other methods (eg. oral contraceptive pill or other hormonal contraceptives). If you become pregnant while taking STOCRIN or in the 12 weeks after you've stopped taking it, tell your doctor immediately. Breastfeeding Talk to your doctor if you are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed. It is possible that your baby can be infected with HIV through your breast milk.

The safety and effectiveness of STOCRIN in these children have not been adequately established. If you have not told your doctor about any of the above, tell them before you take any STOCRIN. During treatment, you may be at risk of developing certain side effects. It is important you understand these risks and how to monitor for them. See additional information under [Section 6.

These include: - terfenadine and astemizole, antihistamines used for allergic conditions, including hayfever - cisapride, used to treat stomach reflux - triazolam (e.g.Halcion), used to treat anxiety, depression or for sleeplessness - midazolam (e.g. Hypnovel), used as a sedative before surgical procedures - some medicines used to Australia) - bepridil (not available in Australia) - STOCRIN should not be taken together with ATRIPLA or other medicines that contain efavirenz. In addition, STOCRIN should not be taken with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal product sold as a dietary supplement, or products containing St. John's wort as it may decrease the effect of STOCRIN. Do not take STOCRIN with elbasvir/grazoprevir as it may decrease the effect of elbasvir/grazoprevir. STOCRIN should not be taken with voriconazole. Some medicines and STOCRIN may interfere with each other. amprenavir (e.g.Agenerase) and lopinavir/ritonavir - telaprevir, simeprevir, boceprevir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir medicines used to treat hepatitis C - clarithromycin (e.g. Klacid), an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections - rifampicin (e.g. Rifadin, Rimycin) and rifabutin (e.g. Mycobutin), antibiotics used to treat TB and infections caused by MAC - atovaquone/proguanil, (e.g. Malarone), or artemether/lumefantrine, medicines used to treat malaria - warfarin and acenocoumarol, medicines used to prevent blood clots - ethinyl oestradiol, used in some oral contraceptives - phenobarbitone, phenytoin and carbamazepine, medicines used to treat epilepsy and/or convulsions - methadone, a medicine used to treat opioid drug dependency - sertraline used to treat depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and panic disorder - bupropion, a medicine used to help you stop smoking - medicines affecting the immune system (e.g ciclosporin, tacrolimus or sirolimus). Your doctor might want to do some additional tests. - itraconazole - diltiazem or similar medicines (calcium channel blockers) - atorvastatin, pravastatin or simvastatin (lipid lowering medicines, also called statins) - medicines with known risk of Torsade de Pointes. QTc prolongation has been observed with the use of efavirenz. Your doctor may need to consider giving you different medicine. These medicines may be affected by STOCRIN, or may affect how well it works. You may need different amounts of your medicine, or you may need to take different medicines. STOCRIN is taken in combination with other medicines commonly used to help treat HIV-infection. These include the protease inhibitors such as indinavir (Crixivan*) and nelfinavir (Viracept*). They also include nucleoside as zidovudine or lamivudine (3TC). The optimal dose of indinavir, when given in combination with efavirenz, is not known. In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur when combination antiretroviral treatment is started. In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur. Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection or inflammation. Make sure your doctor and pharmacist know about all of the medicines you are taking, as they have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while taking STOCRIN. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure about what medicines, vitamins or supplements you are taking and if these affect STOCRIN. 4. How do I use STOCRIN? How much to take Take STOCRIN only when prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor will tell you how many tablets you need to take each day. - For adults and children weighing greater than or equal to 40 kg, the normal dose is 600 mg once a day. It is important that you are started and continue on this dose. - For children and teenagers 3 to 17 years old, the dose depends on body weight. Your child's doctor will decide the dose. Carefully follow all directions given to you by your doctor. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet. If you do not understand the instructions on the bottle or box, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help. How to take STOCRIN Swallow STOCRIN with a glass of water. Take STOCRIN on an empty stomach, preferably just before bedtime. If you take STOCRIN with food, this can increase the risk of side effects. When to take it Take STOCRIN at about the same time each day. Taking your tablets at the same time each day is important because keeping a constant level of STOCRIN in your body helps prevent resistance. Resistance means that the medicine may lose its effectiveness over time. Your doctor may ask you to take STOCRIN at bedtime to avoid or reduce certain side effects, such as dizziness and sleepiness. How long to take it STOCRIN helps control your HIV infection but does not cure it. Therefore, STOCRIN must be taken every day. Continue taking STOCRIN for as long as your doctor prescribes. Do not stop taking STOCRIN or change the dose without first checking with your doctor. Do not let yourself run out of medicine over weekends or on holidays. If you have a break in therapy or reduce your dose temporarily, the virus may develop resistance and therefore STOCRIN may no longer be effective. If, for any reason, your therapy with STOCRIN is interrupted or stopped, tell your doctor. If you forget to use STOCRIN If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking your tablet as you would normally. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to. If you are not sure whether to skip the dose, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed. If you have trouble remembering to take your tablets, ask your pharmacist for some hints. If you use too much STOCRIN If you think that you have used too much STOCRIN, you may need urgent medical attention. You should immediately: - phone the Poisons Information Centre (by calling 13 11 26), or - contact your doctor, or - go to the Emergency Department at your nearest hospital. You should do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. 5. What should I know while using STOCRIN? Things you should do - Report any changes in your condition to your doctor immediately. - This is to make sure that any infections which occur due to your low immunity (called opportunistic infections) are treated promptly. - Continue to use safe sexual practices. STOCRIN has not been shown to decrease the chance of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or blood contamination. If you are about to be started on any new medicine, tell your doctor and pharmacist that you are taking STOCRIN. Tell all the doctors, dentists and pharmacists who are treating you that you are taking STOCRIN. Things you should not do - Do not stop taking STOCRIN or change the dose without first checking with your doctor. Do not let yourself run out of medicine over weekends or on holidays. If you have a break in therapy or reduce your dose temporarily, the virus may develop resistance and therefore STOCRIN may no longer be effective. If, for any reason, your therapy with STOCRIN is interrupted or stopped, tell your doctor. Do not give STOCRIN to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you. Driving or using machines Be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how STOCRIN affects you. STOCRIN may cause dizziness, drowsiness or affect concentration in some people, especially during the first few days. Make sure you know how you react to STOCRIN before you drive a car or operate machinery. If you drink alcohol, dizziness or drowsiness may be worse. Looking after your medicine - Keep your tablets in the original bottle, until it is time to take them. Follow the instructions in the carton on how to take care of your medicine properly. Store it in a cool dry place away from moisture, heat or sunlight; for example, do not store it: - in the bathroom or near a sink, or - in the car or on window sills. Keep it where young children cannot reach it. When to discard your medicine If your doctor tells you to stop taking STOCRIN, or the tablets have passed their expiry date, ask your pharmacist what to do with any that are left over. Getting rid of any unwanted medicine If you no longer need to use this medicine or it is out of date, take it to any pharmacy for safe disposal. Do not use this medicine after the expiry date. 6. Are there any side effects? STOCRIN helps most people with HIV infection, but it may have unwanted side effects. All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical treatment if you get some of the side effects. Frequently it is difficult to tell whether side effects are the result of taking STOCRIN, effects of the HIV disease or side effects of other medicines you may be taking. For this reason, it is very important to inform your doctor of any change in your condition. Your doctor may want to change your dose or advise you to stop taking STOCRIN. See the information below and, if you need to, ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any further questions about side effects.
