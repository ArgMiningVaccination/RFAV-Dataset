Pregnancy and Tylenol increase risk of autism and AHDH in unborn Allegedly. There's a class suit going on, apparantly. Anyway, does it bother you that this wasn't previously made known? Will you be taking legal action? Lastly, WHAT (if anything) will pregnant persons take for pain relief, now? Sorry for sh!tty title. Multitasking is a b. but that goes to the legislation and the availability of over the counter medicines in a supermarket with 0 interaction with a trained pharmacologist which I personally think it is an aberration. this is the insert of tylenol equivalent in Spain. I dont have US one at hand I only have a few friends who have already been pregnant, but one of them took Tylenol almost daily due to frequent migraines. Speaking for myself, I took it quite a bit with my toddler because of my gallbladder. The legal theory would be that it is not enough for there to be a study. Customers need to be made well aware of the increased risk. Sort of how Alleve has warnings in re drinking while taking the medication. yep my understanding is that needs to be prolonged usage for it to have an effect in the correlation with increase of risk. they did not find correlation with casual usage of tylenol. I think this has been known for a while. (i just checked and there is a huge study in 2018). edit. phrasing \"What studies are saying In a 2018 study, researchers did a meta-analysis of seven studies involving 132,738 pairs of mothers and children. People were followed for periods ranging from three to 11 years, depending on the study, using questionnaires, interviews, and self-reports on medication use.The analysis revealed a 20% higher risk of autism and a 30% higher risk of ADHD for children who had prolonged exposure to acetaminophen during fetal development. acetaminophen during pregnancy \u2014 in one study, for fewer than eight days \u2014 didn't increase risks. Other studies since then have supported earlier findings that too much acetaminophen may increase one's risk for autism and ADHD. \"Acetaminophen is still the safest known drug to take during pregnancy for problems like fever and pain,\" says Dr. Zanotti. \"When you're pregnant, it's riskier to have an untreated fever than it is to take acetaminophen.\" Source: [https://health.clevelandclinic.org/pregnancy-does-acetaminophen-heighten-risks-for-autism-adhd/](//health.clevelandclinic.org/pregnancy-does-acetaminophen-heighten-risks-for-autism-adhd/) [clevelandclinic.org Opens a new window](//health.clevelandclinic.org/pregnancy-does-acetaminophen-heighten-risks-for-autism-adhd/) [Opens a new window](//health.clevelandclinic.org/pregnancy-does-acetaminophen-heighten-risks-for-autism-adhd/) - A federal judicial panel has created a new mass tort litigation for claims accusing Costco Wholesale Corp, Walmart Inc and other major retailers of failing to warn that using acetaminophen, a popular pain and fever-reduction medication, during pregnancy can cause autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation in St. Louis on Wednesday consolidated 18 lawsuits for pretrial proceedings before U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan. The panel sent an additional 48 cases to the newly created multidistrict litigation on Thursday, saying the same scientific and legal questions underlie all of the cases. The lawsuits target retailers that sell the over-the-counter drug, also sold by Johnson & Johnson under the brand name Tylenol. (...) Plaintiffs in the lawsuits claim that the retailers failed to warn pregnant users of acetaminophen products about the neurological risks to the fetus. In their motion to create an MDL, plaintiffs' lawyers said it was \"virtually certain that tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands\" of similar lawsuits would eventually be filed because of the popularity of acetaminophen and the growing prevalence of autism and ADHD.

[reuters.com Opens a new window](//www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/mass-tort-launched-claims-that-acetaminophen-caused-autism-adhd-2022-10-06) [Opens a new window](//www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/mass-tort-launched-claims-that-acetaminophen-caused-autism-adhd-2022-10-06) It's prob more of a legal tactic that the retailers are being sued before the manufacturers. Many of the retailers (Costco, CVS, etc) brands are based on wellness and they won't want the bad publicity that accompanies a judgement and damage awards, which creates better leverage when negotiating settlements. J&J has some corporate stuff going on (splitting divisions) and a newly created subsidiary filing chapter 11 so they will probably be sued eventually... after that all settles down. The smaller companies making paracetamol aren't as well known, don't have the vested interests in their brand and reputation, and their pockets aren't as deep. see? It is interesting! Thank you for the explanation :) They can still take Tylenol. Most women aren't taking Tylenol in the quantities that they were in these studies. The authors in the now well known and recognized paper even deliberately wrote that they don't want the results of the research showing a connection to be taken out of context. I'm not saying that there isn't a connection, but there are so many other factors at play that would raise the risk beyond that of Tylenol. This is definitely not a new finding, it's been known for a few years at least. I took Tylenol quite a bit during my pregnancy with my toddler due to gallstones. Yes this bothers me. I'm pregnant and have been taking tylenol for headaches. Had I known it increased risk of autism and ADHD I wouldn't have taken it. My headaches weren't THAT bad so I could've just pushed through And baby powder and dry shampoo causes cancer. And having a baby before 25 and after 29 increases the likelihood of bipolar disorder. I think people need to stop with \"forcing\" causes. I also believe mild Autism and ADHD are horribly over diagnosed. Half of the \"causes\" are teachers who don't care as much as you'd think. Where's the class action lawsuit on that? I have adhd, as does my child. I'm 100% aware it's not a behavioral problem. Both my kid and I have learned managing and coping skills. Without having a proper evaluation and management plan, both of our adhd can manifest as behavioral issues, especially for my kid when why were younger and undiagnosed. Their teachers never would have had the tools, or had been able to give my kid the support they needed, if I had not followed through with an evaluation. I had gone undiagnosed the vast majority of my life. Had my kids teacher not pushed for an evaluation, I never would have had them evaluated since I had little knowledge on adhd myself. Not to mention medication and adhd itself was highly scrutinized when we were getting our kid evaluated. It was because of the teacher pushing for an evaluation back when my kid was 5/6 that got them the proper resources they needed to succeed in school... and educate me. So to circle back to the statement you quoted me saying... yes teachers shouldn't have to put up be behavioral problems when parents, admin, and the overall community refuses to acknowledge it. Had I refused to have my kid evaluated, the teacher would basically have had to put up with a child whose core issues were medical, but the parent refused to acknowledge. That's asking an awful lot from someone whose job is to educate, not babysit. If an untreated child is being disruptive and preventing the other 20 students from learning then the teacher has very little options. I'm not a teacher! And I agree if an educator views adhd as a behavior problem then they should not be in the business of educating. If they are unaware of any diagnosis, and parents, admin, community are refusing to take steps to help the teacher get to the source of the unwanted behaviors we can't be blaming the teacher for treating unwanted behaviors like behavioral problems. I'm very much in agreement with what you're saying about the educational system. It's a complete disaster and very much outdated. Your zip code absolutely determines the type of education you will receive. Black and Brown students are at a huge disadvantage starting at the preschool level. We need an overhaul. ah, ok. We were just talking about this at our last professional development day. Teachers are concerned about this happening. It's a real issue. Oh, when I mentioned Title 1 schools I was referring to the way that testing (rates and performance) is held over the heads of teachers, parents, and students - lending to teachers teaching to the test and not to the students, further impairing students with different educational needs because it's a motivator for segregation and exclusion from the classroom. A systemic issue. I agree with what you're saying. Yes, there are major systemic problems. I guess I took what you were saying at the beginning about Title 1 funded schools to be about individual schools vs. systemic issues. That's why I talked about my Title 1 school. I admit it's hard for me to have conversations about the system because I don't believe in the system (it's so flawed), and because at the end of the day, my focus has to be on my school because there is to much need. I run around like a chicken with its head cut off most days, trying to meet as many needs as possible. \"I'm not sure why teachers are expected to put up with behavioral problems when parents, admin, community are refusing to acknowledge them.\" ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder, not a \"behavioral problem\". If that's how you feel you really need to not be a teacher. Like, please do anything else. Sorry I'm just seeing your response. My notifications on this app only work work every third full moon for about 14 seconds. Lol. I meant the example you brought up was unprompted. I don't like having these conversations when someone uses a highly specific individual action to discuss what is a systematic issue... because then it feels like I'm attacking you personally but I don't want to do that. I just wanna criticize the system. Teachers perceptions matter. Black male students with ADHD are more likely to be disciplined, suspended, physically and mechanically restrained than they'd white male counterparts. They fade the highest suspension rates and the number one reason for suspension is a \"violent\" (subjective) incident without injury (objective) ... which is a direct result of the racially biased ways in which teachers interpret their behavior. These types of exclusionary (suspensions) and violent (restraints) disciplines have long term negative impacts. Also black students with ADHD are more likely to be in segregated classrooms, while white students are more likely to be in inclusive classrooms for the majority of their day - another consequence of teacher bias and negative racially biased perceptions. At the end of the day, if an ill -equipped, inexperienced, racist teacher is suspending your kid when what they really need is support- it's an unfair system for the parents and the kids. What are the parents supposed to do? There are no good options. yes, I'm the only counselor in my school with over 500 students. It would be such a help to our community to have another counselor. Teachers know I do what I can and are thankful for it, but what I can do is not enough. Our classrooms are between 18 and 22 students, so not horrible, but 20-some kindergartens is really difficult to manage for many reasons. \"perhaps the wealthiest citizens should pay more taxes to support education/other things?\" Of course. Last I checked, the federal government collects the most taxes. I have no problem with the federal government giving more to fund schools. As for support, hiring more and lessening the load on current school staff. You're a counselor, right? I've been in schools that have 1-2 counselors for 600 students. That's not practical. Teachers trying to teach 30+ students, some who are below grade level, some who have special needs or ELL students, with no support? How is that practical? yes you did say that. I'm genuinely curious about your thoughts about how schools should be funded. Should they receive more federal funding? Where would you pull the funding from? Or is it a taxation issue, and perhaps the wealthiest citizens should pay more taxes to support education/other things? Or something else? There is money for lots of things. All that needs to happen is education needs to be priotized and properly funded. Evaluations aren't free either. Children who need evaluations should of course have them. Children who need some help shouldn't be denied help because they haven't gone through the long process of an evaluation. But yes, the system is problematic, which is what I said hours ago. but where would the money/resources come from? I've been speaking about the system as it is with so many problems I can't begin to speak to them all, not an ideal system that would somehow need all students' educational needs. My actual main issue with US public education is that it's supposed to be built on the ideals of the nation, and I don't see how it's sustainable or realistic to provide good and equitable education to all citizens. It's a wonderful idea but clearly isn't working, and I'm not sure it's really possible. Maybe people smarter than myself can figure it out, but for right now, I do my best each day to serve the best interests of my students within the current, broken system. \". I don't disagree that it would be ideal for all students who could benefit from resources to have access to them. But there are limited resources, and we have to triage and make sure the neediest students receive the resources.\" It sounds like you do agree that it's problematic. Schools aren't emergency rooms. They should provide a proper education for all students. what do you mean that's not what I wrote?? Schools do not have unlimited resources. I don't disagree that it would be ideal for all students who could benefit from resources to have access to them. But there are limited resources, and we have to triage and make sure the neediest students receive the resources. I can't personally speak to the racially inequality as my school is about 97% white, and it just doesn't look the same as the statistics. The inequality is real though and sucks. These are definitely systematic problems in all systems in our country, including education. That's not what you wrote. But actually a doctor doesn't always run a test before treating. That's a very poor analogy. A child who needs extra support should be given it. I'm not sure exactly what point you're trying to make. What @SorayaMontenegro is true and well documented. Black children, especially boys are often labeled as ED, or something else when that's not always the case. Sometimes they just need extra support. There's nothing dangerous about supporting any students' learning. And supporting other students should not take away from SWD who need an IEP and services. no. They \"might\" need services. Do we treat medical problems without running tests first? That would be poor practice and dangerous and a waste of resources for those that truly need them. totally problematic. The issue comes down to funding Our school generally starts the process by reaching out to parents with concerns. If the concerns require services we can't provide, or services that require more frequent visits then the budge allows for, then further evaluations need to be done that require parents to initiate them. We might be able to provide speech once every 6 days for 15min. If the child required more then that, we need the parents to consent to a more intense evaluation. That's the problem with our entire education system. \"Schools can't just give services to any student that might need extra support.\" Don't you think that is problematic? well, yes, students have to be evaluated by the school to possibly qualify for services. Parents don't have to have them evaluated by outside agencies. Of course students need to be evaluated by the school. Schools can't just give services to any student that might need extra support. we have so many students in need of services that they can't get until parents go through the evaluation process. OT, speech, accommodations... the list is long I'm not disagreeing with what you're saying. I'm disagreeing with PP placing the blame on teachers, when they lack support from admin, parents, and their community. I didn't read the middle of this conversation before replying to PP. My comment to you was mainly to point out services can not be given in most cases until an evaluation either ruled something in or out. Therefore the school (aka teacher) might be pushing the parents/student for an evaluation so they can actually receive services (speech, extra math, accommodations for seating, given extra time for lunch, be allowed a snack earlier then normal, have more time for a test, be allowed to have fidget toys on the desk..). I'm not sure why teachers are expected to put up with behavioral problems when parents, admin, community are refusing to acknowledge them. I'm not denying that minority students are at a disadvantage. Or that the system is inherently racist. The educational system in this country is a complete disaster in need of desperate reform in virtually every area Ohok. You \"doubt it\". Seems legit. you're right that sometimes evaluations need to be done. For example, I have been a case manager for the handful of students on 504 plans we have at my school, and those require a medical diagnosis. There are a number of reasons why kids in schools in lower income areas have higher rates of ADHD diagnoses and I doubt the teachers are the biggest factor in this. Adults with ADHD have higher rates of unemployment, lower incomes than non-ADHD counterparts, higher rates of job switching, are less likely to finish school etc. There is a genetic component to ADHD, so over time the cycle repeats itself across generations. I don't know why you find it so shocking that teachers are the ones who recommended testing in almost half of all cases. Teachers spend a lot of time with students in classrooms, which is where issues of time management and focus are most detectable. Primary care physicians hardly spend any time with the kids who come in for consults. And parents don't always know what to look out for when it comes to ADHD. A lot of parents also rely on teachers to let them know if there are concerns regarding their kids academic progress and behaviour in school. Parents spend time with their kids playing, relaxing and so on. ADHD can present differently in that context than it does in the classroom. I really don't know what the purpose of these little anecdotes are. This is a much bigger conversation about the role of educators in the diagnosis and management of learning and attention disorders, and how the educational system disadvantages minority students, especially in schools with a majority of low income students. But sometimes this and sometimes that. I don't care. You think parents are the problem and I disagree. The majority of teachers in the United States are racist and classist. That's a big old problem, that problem is compounded in low income school districts with minority student populations, and it is evident when you recognize that zip code, race, ethnicity, and family financial status all affect likelihood of diagnosis, and that black male students are significantly more likely to be identified by teachers as having behavioral disorders and then segregated from their peers as a result. But sure, it's all about PITA kids and the poor teachers who have to deal with them. \"@CounselorKate, I believe the students and the parents perspective is more accurate. It the parent and student feel that they are being forced or coerced by school personnel, then we have a problem. Even if the school personnel say, \"That's not what I meant.\"\" Sometimes in order for students to get the services they need, and the parents are demanding, parents have to have kids evaluated. Sometimes they need to rule out things before they can receive services in the classroom. \"But you must live where the schools have excellent funding because in my low income schools it was easier to get the difficult children just out in a different class. And the teacher doesn't have to do much if they put the onus on the parents with a simple, \"your child needs testing\" (testing that is flawed and not always conclusive to boot) when the teacher just needs an attitude adjustment.\" The schools being low income isn't the teachers doing. You're putting blame on teachers when the real issue is the parents, the people not voting for proper school funding, admin... If your kid is a PITA then as the parent it's your job to work with the school and teacher to get their behavior under control. It's not the teachers job to have to deal with problematic students. ETA- without any support from admin and parents and community I'm curious what you are referring to as unprompted. My email with the parent or my bringing it up to you? I would agree it's not about me or a single incident. These parents (both that perceive medication is being recommended and those who talk about indoctrination) have had experiences that led up to these conversations that have colored how they see things. That doesn't mean that today's schools are the problem. Parents carry negative experiences from 20+ years ago, and schools are not the same as they were then. I appreciate this discourse, and I hope you don't see it as fruitless. I am always willing to listen and reflect. I hope we both can get something out of this dialogue. \"In my example, it's not something I did.\" This can be really hard for people sometimes to understand, but it's actually not about you. And it's not about the single incident you described occurred yesterday, unprompted. I find it very difficult to have these conversations with teachers on here. It's like talking with cops wives about cops. Fruitless. it is a problem, but not necessarily a teacher problem. In my example, it's not something I did. We have some issues parents that assume that when we bring up attention concerns, we are going to recommend medication. They tell us things like they don't want to put their kid on drugs or that they don't like what they've seen meds do to other people. I understand reservations about having children diagnosed or medicated, but some assume we are going to push when we aren't. It's not unlike conservative parents who assume we are indoctrinating their children with liberal junk. Some parents will see schools in a negative light, no matter the positive interactions they have with staff. I did not state teachers diagnose. Those are clearly two statements separated by a period. Nearly half of cases (46%) began with a teacher recommendation. Only 11% are recommended by primary care physicians and a miniscule 3% by the professionals best suited to diagnose. That is either teachers over stepping or a mass groups are being denied access to the most appropriate testing. Despite needing the testing to have the most accurate diagnosis. *Parents are the anomaly as by proximity you would have the best advantage to know when something is off. Family knows. I believe the students and the parents perspective is more accurate. It the parent and student feel that they are being forced or coerced by school personnel, then we have a problem. Even if the school personnel say, \"That's not what I meant.\" but which perspective is more accurate? It's hard to know I'm sure. I'm the counselor at a K-6 school. I have over 500 students. I am involved in most conversations about attention and behavior concerns. Just this morning I was emailing with a parent about her child that is in an attention counseling group with me. I expressed that focusing is very challenging for her son, but he can do it with concerted effort. The parent could perceive this as me recommending medication, but obviously I didn't and really didn't intend for the parent to perceive such a thing. I find that teachers in Title 1 schools and the parents/students tend to have very different perceptions on this topic and others. I was with you until the teachers comment. As a teacher I can confidently say we do not act like doctors. We do not try and diagnose students as having ADHD or Autism and if a teacher does mention the student needs to be evaluated by a trained professional it's because that's in the best interest for the kid. The student probably needs additional support in class due to failing grades or social emotional issues. That being said I do have kids with accommodations currently that do not need them. So at their annual meeting I will speak with the committee and let them know my thoughts on it. We all have to agree before any accommodations can be removed Definitely the bigger issue is how teachers and other staff can treat students with diagnoses. It can be a label that comes with a stigma and doesn't give kids the opportunities to thrive that they deserve. I agree that the system allows for certain districts to utilize best practice while others just around the corner end up inadvertently penalizing students who have been diagnosed or labeled ASD/ADHD. And Betsy and Ron can both go suck one. RESULTS Teachers were most likely to be first to suggest the diagnosis of ADHD (46.4%; 95% CI, 44.1%-48.7%), followed by primary care physicians (11.3%; 95% CI, school personnel other than teachers (6.0%; 95% CI, 4.9%-7.2%), consultants such as child psychiatrists or psychologists (3.1%; 95% CI, 2.3%-3.9%) and other specified categories (3.0%; 95% CI, 2.4%-3.6%). CONCLUSIONS Teachers and other school personnel are often the first to suggest the diagnosis of ADHD in children in the greater Washington, DC, area. Regional variations in the prescribing of medication for ADHD may be caused at least in part by variations in the likelihood of a teacher suggesting the diagnosis of ADHD. [nih.gov Opens a new window](//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1466583/) [Opens a new window](//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1466583/) my school receives Title 1 funding, but we absolutely do not and cannot recommend students take medication or report parents for neglect if they don't administer medication for something like ADHD. IDEA prohibits the mandate, but unless a state enacts a law private schools can still mandate it and (I believe but would have to double check this) publicly funded charter schools can also mandate. It's really important for states to pass laws about this, but most haven't. There's also ways around it, in that a school doesn't have to make an express mandate but can essentially force students to be medicated through suspensions and other subjective type penalties and punishments. The issue is less the diagnosis (I don't agree that it's over diagnosed) but in how that diagnosis then contributes to the segregation, isolation, and expulsion of marginalized student populations from schools. Our educational system is just so piecemeal because it's the system is so localized that actions which would never happen in X district are sometimes commonplace in Y district. Cue Betsy Devos and DeSantis and other lunatics trying to obliterate the education system for funsies. I thought that IDEA classified ADHD medication as a controlled substance and therefore made it illegal to be mandated by a school or their personnel? I agree that things which shouldn't necessarily affect diagnosis, such as zip code, race, ethnicity, and financial status do have an effect on who gets diagnosed and that is not good. I appreciate the info. It has been my experience that qualifying a student as ADHD or ASD requires an exorbitant amount of effort when approached in a school environment. I recognize that may not be the case nationwide and also that a diagnosis can sometimes lack a positive impact or even have a negative impact. I don't agree with HiMama's overall take, however in schools that receive Title I funds there are higher rates of students who receive ADHD diagnoses and it is thought to be an indirect cause. State laws vary, but a majority of states do allow school personnel to recommend that a child take a psychotropic medication, require that a child take a psychotropic medication as a condition of enrollment, or use a parent's refusal to medicate the child as the sole basis for an accusation of neglect. Zip code, race, ethnicity, and family financial status all affect likelihood of diagnosis, with black male students in schools with higher rates of low income students receiving the highest rates of ADHD diagnoses, and Hispanic students receiving lower rates of diagnoses yet being more likely to be segregated into ELL schools or isolated in ELL classrooms in schools. While boiling the issues down to the teachers needed an attitude adjustment is overly simplistic, the schools do play a major role in the diagnosis and treatment of students with ADHD and their impact is not always positive. Most of the posters are agreeing that correlation doesn't equal causation and aren't currently blaming tylenol. Tylenol isn't being sued (yet), only some retailers. Right now I think a suit is premature and a cash grab, but further research needs to be done. I've never seen a child \"forced\" into a diagnosis, I've only ever seen parents struggle to find help or answers so they can know what to do in order to help their kid thrive. I have a family member who literally specializes in an area of law helping these families because their schools won't even follow the law and help with their necessary accommodations, this happens in both high and low income districts. There are adults (mainly women) getting diagnosed with ADHD and ASD even now when their parents were told \"nothing is wrong with them\" as children. As research has continued, criteria for diagnosis has changed so fewer children are slipping through the cracks by using masking behaviors. Like a previous poster said, it's difficult AF to get an appointment for testing in a lot of places unless you have $$$ to come out of pocket. If you had said rich people were getting their kids misdiagnosed to get them unnecessary accommodations I might have believed it, because it's more plausible, ime. What kind of school district I live in is irrelevant. I disagree that low income schools are pushing misdiagnosis to recieve additional funding. When a child receives extra funding it goes towards hiring appropriate staff in order to meet that students legally required accommodations. It's not just a cash grab free-for-all like you're asserting. This happens in low AND high income districts. \"But you must live where the schools have excellent funding because in my low income schools it was easier to get the difficult children just out in a different class.\" Can you also elaborate on this statement? Bc this makes even less sense than your first. Children are not diagnosed with ASD and ADHD bc their teacher needs an attitude adjustment. Also there's only 8 billion people on the planet so idk how we could have trillions of babies missing cash outs. \"Half of the 'causes' are teachers who don't care as much as you'd think.\" Can you elaborate on what you mean here? Bc it sounds like you're saying teachers just label or even diagnose kids with ASD or ADHD bc they're lazy and that's easier than teaching a difficult child. You are misinformed on how these diagnoses happen. They don't happen in school. If they do happen in school it is done by a licensed psychologist who works for the district. If a teacher were to have concerns about a particular student, and raise them with the special education team, it actually takes an insane amount of work, documenting, and trying lower tier interventions before the IEP qualifcation process would even start . So a teacher has to care an awful lot to raise concerns and take action before labeling a student as ASD ADHD. huh? Please, what examples do you have of \"children forced into their diagnosis and ultimately damned from it too\". Do you have any experience with what it takes for parents to get a diagnosis for any condition for their kids? It sounds like you are making some really big statements that just don't make a lot of sense. All it takes is one adult to push an idea. How many children are being put into special classes when they really needed an adult to stop and say hey perhaps it's not my child that is not working right but the environment. I have too often seen children who were forced into their diagnosis and ultimately damned from it too. But you must live where the schools have excellent funding because in my low income schools it was easier to get the difficult children just out in a different class. And the teacher doesn't have to do much if they put the onus on the parents with a simple, \"your child needs testing\" (testing that is flawed and not always conclusive to boot) when the teacher just needs an attitude adjustment. Even having just two out of ten diagnosed incorrectly is too much IMO. If Tylenol causes these problems how come the trillions of babies born since 1950, are not getting a cash out? Or is it just Tylenol today? Or did someone somewhere decide to play refer madness and do testing under circumstances otherwise not achieved by a majority of Tylenol takers. Keep in mind the amount used to cause concerns is far beyond what anyone at home would be taking for a headache. Hence my dramatic examples of similar circumstance. I pushed the extreme of what is maybe .02% of the cases but its enough that I too can make a big argument that can fear monger. What? Teachers don't diagnose ASD or ADHD. The most they could do is recommend an evaluation, and even then it has to be communicated to a parent through the school or district psychologist. And then an evaluation is conducted by a licensed physician, typically a child psychologist. Teachers don't diagnose ADHD or ASD. If they recommended testing and an independent child psychologist finds a that a child meets the criteria for either condition, then how would that be liable for a lawsuit? I think it's one of those things that I won't mentally deal with until there's more information. So far it looks like there's a correlation, and no causal risk has been established. The risks being published are relative and not absolute (huge difference) and the absolute risks are much lower (in the realm of 3-5%). Risks based on Doses, frequency of use, and duration of usage, haven't been established. And what was the alternative? Be in pain? Sometimes that would be okay, other times not. Remain with fever? Sometimes there would be an alternative and sometimes not. When my youngest was identified to have an adrenal tumor I asked the oncologist if IVF contributed. And he said he didn't think so, but if even if there was a possibility... what was the alternative? No IVF and no baby? Would I have chosen that route? He said something that at the time made me want to punch him dead in his face (but with time and distance I've gained perspective and no longer want to punch him in the face) which was that sometimes we just have to accept ambiguity for our own sake and keep moving. Right now, there's so much ambiguity in these studies. I do hope they are able to continue the research and clarify for future pregnant people, so they can make the best decisions for them and their pregnancy with their doctors. I always suffer though pregnant or not but I'm paranoid and hate taking medication because of it. I had my second baby with no pain relief and didn't take Tylenol after either. I was fine and everything was great but yeah I'm anti drugs for myself unless I'm absolutely dying of pain or sickness. My sister calls me crunchy granola \"I took Tylenol a handful of times during both pregnancies. My first is on the spectrum. Second is not. Ship has sailed and I don't really give a sh\u00edt.\" This is exactly my situation. My oldest son is autistic and I sincerely doubt a handful of Tylenol taken over 9 months caused his ASD. I am soooooo sick of people trying to find the smoking gun that causes autism and then panicking about it. I get the worst hormonal headaches when pregnant. My oldest is diagnosed ADHD and I suspect my second might have it too. Could Tylenol have had something to do with it? Possibly. But their dad and all of his siblings have ADHD. So I'm going to go out on a limb and say that genetics are more likely the cause. I hate that this will give me a reason to question whether things would have been different if I chose to suffer through the headaches instead. All of this. I took Tylenol a handful of times during both pregnancies. My first is on the spectrum. Second is not. Ship has sailed and I don't really give a sh\u00edt. I hate that this will inevitably make many mothers choose to suffer through pain or stress over taking it. Yeah this is how I feel too. It's not keeping me up at night but I wish the association had been more prominently made known. I know at least for me there would have been many days where I would have just dealt with the pain instead of taking the Tylenol. Thank you for sharing about your daughter dios la bendiga. agree. also i am not gonna go down the rathole of reading the studies but the correlation with multifactorial things is always difficult. is it the tylenol or the increase of e.g. cortisol in response to pain that people in chronic pain might have? what would had been the consequence of the alternative? eta. and I am super on favor to study any possible effect. but in this specific case the correlation with increased risk is at very specific usage. I kind of feel like it's the connection with vaccines, if everyone takes Tylenol when pregnant than it's likely that every child with Autism and ADHD was born to a mother who took Tylenol while pregnant. this. It's like saying we studied xx kids with autism And adhd ( Which combined effected such a high percentage of kids ) and their moms by large numbers all ate chocolate while pregnant sue hersheys !! And the results will Lead to women suffering without pain relief and without medication They sometimes need. The risk Of untreated fevers and antenatal Depression from Chronic pain - gallstones headaches etc. far outweigh the \"risk\" of adhd yeah I had a lot of pain at the end of my pregnancies both times in my hip it was the only thing I'd could take so i too it. good connection you make about tylenol and vaccines. yeah i think after my first born i decided screw it. this pregnancy has been super uncomfortable and anything to help with the symptoms, i will gladly take. give me the drugs! I did go down the rabbit hole and I did find a few studies that link increased cortisol with increase of risk for adhd (at least in models for study, rats). so literally damn if you do, damn if you don't. anything you do or eat or breath or don't do or dont eat or dont breath the only pain medication i took with my first was when i got my epidural. next they'll say epidurals cause autism or prenatal vitamins. or iron pills. idk i just think this is harmful to pregnant women. being pregnant is stressful enough YEP. i'm tired of this conversation. i didn't take any form of medication with my first and he still has autism. i was always too scared to take medicine. this pregnancy i've taken medication for HG and antibiotics. i think it's genetic or environmental factors, either way it is what it is This is my take on it too. Tylenol (acetaminophen) is the only approved pain reliever for pregnant women. Pregnancy brings on headaches and so many other aches and pains. Of course there is a huge percentage of women who take something to help relieve the pain. I hate that this study is going to cause women to suffer even more. They'll either choose not to take anything for the pain or they'll stress themselves out worrying about whether or not their child will be harmed from taking a few doses of Tylenol. Women seriously just cannot win. In 2018 when pregnant with my first, Tylenol was not on the permitted list from my OB. I understood Tylenol to be a no no then\u2014-but wasn't aware of the study. But legit question\u2014what is the difference between giving your infant Tylenol and giving your baby Tylenol, and taking it while pregnant? Brain developing at a different period? In most places you are told to talk to a doc before taking medication and specially if the usage is going to be more than a casual single dosage. if you are pregnant and 103 f, have gallstones or anything like that the answer is talk to a doctor. I don't care what other people do to be honest. It was on my list not to take it and I didn't. Can't say I have passionate feelings either way. I had back to back grueling pregnancies. I get it. Believe me. out of curiousoty had you say - got sick and spiked a 103 Temp how did hit on plan to treat it? Slipped and broke a bone? Had debilitating migraines? Gallstones and the list goes on. Pregnant women deserve medical Treatment and pain relief when needed and Tylenol remains the safest way to do That . They're not just incubators that makes sense. I was just worried because I did give my infant (when allowed I forget the age) Tylenol during teething. Its over all fetal development. Everything is being built and some drugs can alter structures and functions. There are charts that explain why taking certain drugs or medications during certain times affect development. It doesn't bother me but I also never took acetaminophen during pregnancy, and my kids have never taken it either. When I was pregnant I used CBD and essential oil rubs for pain relief. I've always used natural remedies and saved pharmaceuticals for basically life or death. That's just me. I've been fortunate to not have to resort to them with no other options.
