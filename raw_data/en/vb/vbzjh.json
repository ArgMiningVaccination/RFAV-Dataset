Talk with your child's doctor before starting any complementary therapies. Complementary therapies should not replace necessary conventional medicine. What are complementary therapies? Complementary therapies are treatments that are not part of the standard medical care usually prescribed by medical doctors. There are many types of complementary therapies, such as [acupuncture](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/acupuncture), chiropractic therapy and herbal supplements. They may also be known as 'integrative medicine'. Sometimes these therapies may be described as 'alternative'. Alternative therapies are used in place of conventional treatment from your doctor or healthcare provider, instead of alongside as is the case with complementary therapies. This can be harmful if there is no evidence for these therapies, if they replace or delay treatments that are evidence-based and advisable, or if they have side effects. Why do parents seek complementary therapies? Parents or caregivers may consider complementary therapies for their child for many reasons, including to prevent illnesses, improve symptoms, provide support or reduce side effects from medical treatment. Complementary therapies have been used in children with different health issues such as [asthma](/asthma-in-children) and [cancer](/dealing-with-childhood-paediatric-cancer), and to contribute to a child's comfort and wellbeing during [palliative care](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/palliative-care). Safety and regulation In Australia, most complementary medicines are not subject to the same high-level evaluation by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) as prescription medicines. Some types of complementary therapy practitioners, such as [Chinese medicine](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/chinese-traditional-medicine) practitioners and chiropractors, are registered with the [Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA)](https://www.ahpra.gov.au/). Registered health practitioners are required to meet quality and standards of care. But many complementary therapy practitioners are not listed with AHPRA. Is complementary therapy right for your child? Be clear about your expectations and check them against the therapy's possible risks and benefits. Importantly, ask your child's doctor how the therapy may affect your child, and if the doctor would be happy for your child to try it. You can also ask your doctor or nurse for recommendations of complementary health practitioners. Always tell your child's doctor if they are already taking any complementary medicines or are undergoing any complementary therapies. Some complementary therapies are [no longer claimable on private health](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/blog/private-health-insurance-whats-changing-on-April-1). This means you would have to pay the full fee for these treatments: - Alexander technique, Feldenkrais, kinesiology - Aromatherapy - Bowen therapy, reflexology, shiatsu - Buteyko - Western herbalism, [homeopathy](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/homeopathy), naturopathy - Iridology - Pilates, tai Chi, [yoga](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/health-benefits-of-yoga-and-pilates) What questions should I ask complementary health practitioners? - What are your qualifications? How long have you been practising? - How does this treatment work? Is there evidence this treatment is effective? - How can this treatment help my child? - What risks or side effects are involved? - How long should this treatment be used for? How will we know if it's working? - What's the cost of the treatment? Can I claim the cost on Medicare or from my health fund? What are types of complementary therapies? Acupuncture [Acupuncture](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/acupuncture) involves placing fine, sterile needles into certain areas of the body to 'improve energy flow'. Acupuncture is generally thought to be safe in children when performed by a trained acupuncturist. Acupuncture may be effective for some children with conditions such as headache and chronic pain. Chiropractic [Chiropractors](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/chiropractors-chiropractic-treatment) usually treat [musculoskeletal](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/bones-muscles-and-joints) conditions. However, the use of chiropractic treatment in young children, for issues such as [colic in babies](/burping-wind-and-colic-in-babies), is controversial. There is no current clinical guideline, or peer-reviewed publication, to guide chiropractors in the care of infants and young children (the use of spinal manipulation, in particular). The Chiropractic Board of Australia advises against using spinal manipulation to treat children under 2 years pending a review of evidence. Herbs Many complementary medicine practitioners use herbs. Some herbs may help while others may not be supported by research. As some herbs may interact with other medicines or even be harmful, it is always important to tell your doctor what you plan to give your child. Be aware that 'natural' doesn't always mean safe. Massage [Massage therapy](/baby-massage) in [neotnatal intensive care units (NICUs)](/neonatal-intensive-care-unit) has been shown to help [premature babies](/premature-baby) with their growth and development. Massage may also be used to help ease the symptoms of colic and pain in hospitalised children. Naturopathy Naturopathy is based on the belief of nature's healing power. Treatments aim to support the body to maintain and restore health through things like diet, herbal supplements or exercise. There isn't much evidence on the use of naturopathy in treating children with medical conditions. Art therapy and music therapy These therapies are 'mind-body techniques' \u2014 based on the belief that what we think or feel can affect our physical health. Some studies in people with cancer demonstrate that music therapy can help reduce pain and [anxiety](/childhood-anxieties-and-fears), while art therapy has been shown to manage symptoms of [fatigue](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/fatigue). Music therapy has also been known to relieve stress and anxiety, enhance communication, boost physical rehabilitation and development, and improve quality of life.
