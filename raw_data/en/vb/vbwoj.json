Remedy K!CK comes in three fruity flavours in time for summer - Blackberry, Lemon Lime and Mango Pineapple. Boasting of no sugar and 80 milligrams of caffeine per can, Remedy K!CK has the same effect as a cup of coffee or other conventional energy drinks. Remedy managing director Chris Gillard said the business dug deep into the needs of its consumers, who are concerned about the impact energy drinks have on their health. \"People are seeking a mental boost without the crash and are looking for something to help them focus at work or while out and about. They don't, however, want the sugar or artificial ingredients that are found in some other energy drinks.\" Remedy K!CK is made from ingredients using green coffee bean extract for its caffeine hit and has the base of Remedy's popular kombucha. The benefits of its kombucha brew include live cultures, antioxidants and organic acids. \"We've taken away the guilt of picking up an energy drink. Remedy K!CK is all natural, has no sugar and only contains nine calories per can,\" Gillard said. Remedy K!CK is the second new drink to be produced in Remedy's new state-of-the-art fermentary in Melbourne. It is the largest fermentary of its kind in the southern hemisphere and is the equivalent size of the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Remedy K!CK is available to purchase from 7-Eleven stores nationwide and will expand into independent supermarkets this year in November. Remedy K!CK can also be bought by the case online on their [website](http://remedydrinks.com). To read more about Australia's latest food and "}
