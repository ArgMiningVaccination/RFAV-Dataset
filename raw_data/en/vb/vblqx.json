These sessions are offered by distance, as energy is not bound by time or space. A free telephone consultation is required before booking a spiritual healing session to determine whether such a treatment is suitable for your needs. Please Note: Reiki (or Universal Life Force Energy) is the ancient Japanese art of healing, which involves the transfer of energy. The practice of reiki, which was developed by Mikao Usui in the 1920s, targets the energy field (\"qi\") around the body, aiming to improve the flow of energy. Reiki may activate the body's relaxation response, which can, in turn, assist in the body's natural healing processes. As a third-degree Reiki Master/Teacher, I have been trained in the practice of in-person and distance reiki, which allows the needed energy to cross any distance in time or space. The energy flow can be helpful to clear blockages which may be impeding you in the present. Distance Reiki works according to an ancient principle called the Hermetic Law of Similarity, which holds that we are all connected, as we are all made of energy and part of a larger whole. Some hospitals and clinics around the world have begun offering Reiki services as a cost-effective way to accelerate recovery after surgery, reduce pain and anxiety, and improve the negative side effects of medications and other medical procedures. Conventional science is still mostly playing catch-up in researching the effectiveness of reiki, but a limited emerging body of evidence is there. Please email us for a list of some of the evidence-based research that we've compiled over the years. Core shamanic healing is an ancient spiritual practice in which the healing practitioner accesses direct revelation by entering trance-like altered states of consciousness (aka shamanic journeys) on behalf of the client, and interacting with the spirit world to bring about healing. In essence, shamanic healers act as intermediaries, on behalf of their clients, between the human and the spirit worlds, and assist in healing their clients' traumas at the soul level, which in turn helps restore balance to the client's emotional and physical body. Shamanic healers can be found in every culture around the world. Core shamanic practices share near-universal features regardless of cultural perspective; the work is primarily carried out with sonic techniques such as repetitive drumming and rattling in a ceremonial setting. Shamanic healings may include: Power Animal Retrievals We all have animal spirits who are willing to guide and protect us throughout our lives. Each power animal carries its unique medicines to assist us and to share its wisdom and attributes with us. A power animal retrieval helps reconnect you with your helping and compassionate spirit animal protector. From a shamanic perspective, one of the primary causes of illness and dis-ease is thought to be a loss of soul power. This is why a power animal retrieval can be a great first step in restoring some of your lost power. Shamanic Extractions From a shamanic perspective, another cause of ill health and unhappiness is the belief in the existence of spiritual energies that have lodged within the body. This happens through years of soul loss brought on by things like negative self-talk or from being exposed to toxic relationships, environments and traumas. Soul Retrievals In shamanism, it is believed that each physical and emotional trauma that we experience causes us to lose touch with a part of our soul, which makes us grow weaker and become disconnected with our core self. A soul retrieval reintegrates our lost soul parts to bring about healing. The causes of soul loss are varied, and may include: Please note that soul retrieval sessions will not be performed until you have recovered from and have been 100% addiction-free for at least 12 months. Ancestral Lineage Healings From a shamanic worldview, it is thought that each of us carries the stories, traumas and pains of our ancestors, even though we may not be conscious of them. These ancient wounds influence how we think and act at a subconscious level, and these energetic imprints affect us in such ways that we may find ourselves recreating dysfunctional transgenerational patterns. Shamanic ancestral lineage healings help clear out any unhelpful ancestral patterns and karma that you may inadvertently be carrying with you, and which may be impacting your wellbeing in the present moment. Such healings involve removing any negative energies, healing the soul of a deceased relative, remembering an ancestor spirit, and helping deceased souls cross over. It is quite common for individuals with traumatic family histories to need ancestral healings for any personal healing to happen. Copyright \u00a9 2022 Mindful Solutions Clinic - All Rights Reserved.
