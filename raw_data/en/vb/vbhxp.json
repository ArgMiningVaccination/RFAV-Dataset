Now, ask yourself: how often are you mindful of your breathing? Healthy lungs are a vital part of our overall health and, according to traditional Chinese medicine, lung health may require a bit of mindfulness. [Acupuncturist](http://thechalkboardmag.com/?s=acupuncture) and Chinese Medicine expert, Mona Dan of [Vie Healing](http://www.viehealing.com), is explaining all about how to nourish these vital organs... The lung's energy and role\u2014as seen in Chinese medicine\u2014is that of making a boundary between the inner and outer world. The inner environment needs to be protected by a clear boundary which both defends and defines the person. Across this boundary, vital materials can be taken in and waste materials excreted. The lung's most vital and obvious role is to take in oxygen, but there is more to it. The Lungs In Chinese Medicine: Immunity + Elimination In Chinese medicine, the lungs are more than just a respiratory system\u2014they are deeply related to the large intestines and hold a strong role in breathing in and out, the necessity of living a healthy life. At the physical level, our boundary to the world begins with our skin\u2014the largest organ on our body\u2014which helps us breathe in and out through the pores. Beneath the skin, lung energy helps the circulation of blood, what we consider the body's defensive layer against outside pathogenic factors. The lung's paired organ is the large intestine, and its main function is to release and eliminate. Together the lung and colon are related to [immunity](http://thechalkboardmag.com/?s=immunity) through the strength of the protective external layer of our skin. Generally, outside pathogens most easily enter through the respiratory and digestive systems, and the lung and colon are responsible for maintaining the function of these systems so that they are not penetrated by outside pathogens. According to Chinese medicine, the body's defensive energy is directly dependent on the strength of the lung and colon. Abundant lung energy presents itself as strong physical energy. There is a sense of softness yet fullness in the chest. In the lung's most healthy state, immunity is strong, recovery from illness is quick and effective, skin is hydrated and the complexion is bright and fresh. Body posture is another physical expression of the state of the lungs, so a strong posture shows healthy lung energy. If lung health is weak, it will present as low energy and a poor immune system. Breathing may be shallow, and skin may appear unhealthy because energy and blood circulation may be weak. Also, emotions in the form of sadness and grief are expressions of lung energy. How To Nourish The Lungs With Chinese Herbs Because the lungs are so closely related to breath\u2014the first sign of energy to enter our bodies\u2014energy strengthening herbs are also for strengthening the lungs. Ginseng Root | Ginseng is considered especially nourishing to the lungs, skin and stomach. Ginseng is said to moisten and cool the lungs, making it particularly useful for those with a dry cough.

Asian ginseng is a yang tonic that tends to be hot in nature. Astragalus | Astragalus is one of the most commonly used Chinese herbs for strengthening and toning energy and the immune system.
