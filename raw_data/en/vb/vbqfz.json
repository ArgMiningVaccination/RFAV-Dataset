Because of these relationships, it is important to assess and support healthy relationships and include the primary caregiver(s) in the child's treatment plan. The following topics are unique to early childhood in their evaluation of relationships - from the intrauterine environment, to adoption considerations, and the concept of collaborative mental and physical healthcare, each link below explores an important aspect of a young child's relationship-centered world. Perinatal Mental Health Prenatal Exposure to Potential Toxins During pregnancy, the developing fetus is dependent on his or her mother for sustenance and a protective environment. Ideally, this environment is free from toxins that might impair healthy growth and development. Unfortunately, this is not always the case - the impact of certain exposures in utero is well documented and yet the exposures remain all too common. Fetal alcohol exposure remains the most common preventable cause of intellectual disability amongst children in the United States. According to recent data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention as many as 1 in 10 pregnant women report alcohol use in the past 30 days. Presentation of symptoms in affected children can vary considerably. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, the most extreme manifestation of exposure, includes characteristic facial abnormalities, growth deficits, and central nervous system abnormalities, but many children are affected without all three of these symptom clusters. DSM-5 includes proposed criteria for Neurobehavioral Disorder Associated with Prenatal Alcohol Exposure detailing neurocognitive, self-regulation, and adaptive functioning problems that could be associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Cigarettes are another well documented source of toxicity for the developing fetus, particularly impairing intrauterine growth, but also linked later on to neurobehavioral challenges for the child such as Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder. It has been challenging to fully understand the impact of illicit drugs, including marijuana, on the developing fetus because many women who use these substances during pregnancy are also more likely to have used alcohol or cigarettes, although it is generally assumed that there are potential risks with these substances as well. Withdrawal symptoms during the neonatal period, as is often seen after prenatal exposure to opioids, may require extended hospital stays for neonates. Environmental toxins such as lead are known to cause fetal neurotoxicity while other chemicals such as Bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates have more recently come under scrutiny because of their potential to disrupt the normal functions of estrogen for both mother and fetus. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has issued a Committee Opinion recommending that pregnant women limit their exposure to these chemicals. Prescription medications can also impact the developing fetus, including those prescribed to mothers diagnosed with mental health disorders. Thankfully, high quality research is ongoing to understand the impact of maternal psychiatric medication during pregnancy to more effectively guide decisions for mothers and the mental health clinicians treating them during pregnancy. Emerging evidence also points to the detrimental effects of excessive maternal stress and depression on the developing fetus. For instance, there is increasing evidence that maternal stress can increase maternal cortisol levels to the point that the fetus is also exposed to the excessive cortisol. This increased cortisol exposure in utero may alter the epigenetic profile of the infant for many years to come. Some toxic exposures, such as those related to maternal stress, are challenging to prevent because of the many factors involved while, in theory, exposure to alcohol, cigarettes, and illicit substances should be preventable through ongoing efforts to disseminate information to women of childbearing age. The concept of the 12-month pregnancy as advocated by the March of Dimes (link below) provides a solid framework for helping would-be mothers think about pregnancy planning and cessation of toxic substances prior to pregnancy. Of course, assisting women struggling with addiction to find treatment resources is another important prevention effort, either before or during pregnancy. For children impacted already because of past exposure, intervening as early as possible to provide supportive emotional and educational services is essential. Of course, the first step is to identify children, through screening for developmental delays using standardized measures (a link should be here to the page about screening and assessment tools for young children). Once identified, they should be connected to Early Intervention services before age three or to Committee for Preschool Special Education between ages 3-5 to assess need for services. This referral should be a standard part of the plan for these children. Studies have identified additional protective factors that can help reduce the effects of fetal alcohol exposure including a loving/nurturing/stable home environment and absence of violence.

Mental Health in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Parents and babies can suffer biological, psychological and emotional stress related to the NICU experience, which can have short and long term effects on the bonds among the family members, the parents' confidence as parents, and the baby's development of a secure attachment and adequate self-regulation skills. Mental health practitioners can play an important role in mitigating these risks, either as consultants or as an integrated part of the NICU team. It is estimated that at least 20-30% of NICU parents experience a diagnosable mental disorder, such as post-partum depression, post-partum anxiety or post-partum psychosis, during the first year following the baby's birth, with an even higher percentage experiencing subclinical symptoms. If a parent has pre-existing mental health, trauma or substance use issues, there is a risk of recurrence or exacerbation of symptoms. Even parents with no previous mental health issues may feel overwhelmed with worry about their infant's fragility and may hold back from fully investing in the baby emotionally. Commonly reported issues in the NICU setting include parental feelings of guilt, wondering whether the parent's actions may have been responsible for the baby's condition, feeling helpless or fearful of causing harm to the infant by doing something wrong, or feeling jealous or angry toward staff who they see as displacing them in caring for their newborn. Families might also be faced with unexpected economic, interpersonal or logistical stressors. In some cases, parents might avoid spending time with the baby or participating in the baby's care, or conversely might focus on minor issues and communicate distrust or frustration toward the medical personnel. To compound this stress, an infant in a NICU is most likely experiencing a serious medical condition and may be undergoing intrusive and painful procedures while having limited opportunity for the skin to skin contact with a consistent caregiver. All of these factors can disrupt the attachment process of the baby to his or her primary care giver, which puts the child at increased risk for social, emotional and behavioral problems in infancy, childhood and adolescence. An integrated mental health practitioner is well poised to screen NICU parents for early signs of post-partum depression, anxiety, or psychosis as well as any pre-existing mental health or substance use issues. He or she can help guide a family through these challenges by identifying and addressing common concerns, promoting healthy coping skills, enhancing the attachment relationship through support and education, with referrals to higher levels of care when appropriate. Mental health practitioners can also can have an important role in support and education of NICU staff, who have high demands placed not only on their skills of medical care, but in their complex interactions with families in crisis. Having a baby in the NICU can be an extremely challenging experience, but providing the needed screening and support services and maximizing the parents' involvement in the baby's care can reduce this stress and significantly improve the outcomes in terms of the parents' confidence in their parenting skills, the attachment among family members and the baby's long-term emotional, psychological and physical development.

Collaborative Mental Health Care for Young Children Over the past decade, national pediatric and family practice organizations have been devoting increasing attention to the idea of integrating mental health and primary care. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry similarly has advocated for increasing collaboration between mental health and medical providers in the primary care setting. To identify at-risk populations, pediatricians can incorporate universal screening tools for important social/behavioral issues (such as [these](https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/Mental-Health/Documents/MH_ScreeningChart.pdf) recommended by the AAP) in addition to monitoring developmental milestones and appropriate vaccination schedules. Those children deemed at risk for mental health conditions can be further assessed by a behavioral health clinician. Successful collaborative care models can include embedded or remotely available mental health clinicians or an embedded social worker/psychologist who has a panel that is overseen by a consulting psychiatrist. Oftentimes, interventions can be delivered by the mid-level provider, with more complex cases referred to a higher level of care. Integrated care strategies are a particularly robust delivery model for young children due to the frequency of their regularly scheduled well child visits with the primary care physician. This is also true of integrated strategies for perinatal patients who likewise see their obstetric provider prior to delivery and their child's pediatrician following delivery. This relationship fosters a trust that enables the PCP to promote education with regard to healthy parenting early in life as well as surveillance for common health conditions in postpartum women such as depression or trauma. In cases where problems are already complex, having a trusted member of the primary care team may provide a connection to care may facilitate compliance with the referral. Toxic stress or adverse early childhood exposures are another important focus of prevention in the primary care setting, and these issues overlap heavily with child and parent mental health in the preschool years. For much more information about this, the American Academy of Pediatrics Resilience Project website is an excellent source of information (see link below) and the National Child Trauma Stress Network (NCTSN) has a number of screening tools for trauma in childhood. If parents are able to limit the amount of toxic stress to their infants and toddlers as well as buffer unpreventable exposures through maintenance of a strong parent-child relationship, children have much better chances for maintaining mental health as they grow. Although there is much information available through the websites noted below, a recently published book may provide the most organized and comprehensive review of collaborative care practices for young children.

[Link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26484620) Adoption Adoption is the permanent, legal transfer of parental rights over a child from biological parents to adoptive parents. It can be a very successful and accepted process, with approximately 80% of adopted children staying with their adoptive families. It is, however, important to recognize the impact of adoption on adoptive and biological parents as well as the child. In some ways adoption is created through loss and consequently grief experienced by each member of the triad. Birthparents lose the child born to them, adoptive child loses their birthparents and adoptive parents lose the child that might have been born to them. Loss of a birthparent may lead to issues with identity in the adopted child and may complicate their relationship with their adoptive parents. It may also lead to a belief of the child that they were \"given up\" for adoption because they were not good enough for their birthparents. Alternately, the child may see his or her adoptive parents as people who \"took them away\" from their biological parents. Adopted children have been reported to have a range of developmental and behavioral difficulties. They can struggle with attachment difficulties, depression, withdrawal and oppositional behaviors. Adoptive parents may feel guilty, inadequate, or rejected when these complex issues arise. Mental health providers and pediatricians must be thoughtful in their work with adopted children and their families. It is important not to simplify the very complex challenges that these families are often struggling with, such as loss, grief, abandonment, separation, deprivation, neglect, instability in their lives. Management, diagnosis and treatment frequently call for individualized approaches. For example, children of adoption who struggle with behavioral issues are often labeled as having an \"attachment disorder\" or are given a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder. In many cases the use of such terms does not only stray from the standard diagnostic system, but also may lead to overlooking conditions that are more common and easily treatable such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or anxiety disorders. In some cases of adopted children, it is also important to consider any trauma which may have preceded their adoption and potentially precipitated their removal from their biologic homes. Such children can benefit grately from trauma-informed treatments such as Child Parent Psychotherapy (for young children) or Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (for older youth).
