We look forward to hearing from you and helping you on your journey to recovery from pain. What is an adjustment? Adjustments are part of the chiropractic treatment used to restore motion to joints that have lost their ability to move normally. For more than 100 years, chiropractors have been specialists in spinal adjustments. Today, about 95% of all spinal adjustments today are performed by chiropractors. What do adjustments actually do? - Increase joint motion - Reflexively relax muscles around the joint - Stretch shortened tissues and release joint adhesions - Relieve nerve compression and irritation - Reduce pain and muscle dysfunction - Stimulate the autonomic nervous system, which regulates organ function - Several chiropractic treatments over a short period have a cumulative effect of achieving long-lasting results and long-term pain relief What makes the popping sound? When a joint is adjusted, the two surfaces of the joint separate. This often produces a \"popping\" or \"cracking\" sound that we call a \"cavitation.\" This isn't bone rubbing on bone, as some think. Instead, it's actually just air. As space is created in the joint and pressure is released, gas enters this space, allowing for increased motion and greater freedom\u2014similar to opening a can of soda.
