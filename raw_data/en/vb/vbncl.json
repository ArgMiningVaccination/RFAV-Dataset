A COMBINATION OF MEDICAL CARE AND LIFESTYLE CHANGES REDUCES RISK AND GIVES WOMEN BETTER CONTROL OF BREAST HEALTH. woman's chances of getting breast cancer. Breast surgeon Deborah Lue, MD, with RWJ Physician Enterprise's Steeplechase Breast Specialists, is an advocate for healthy living who frequently lectures about wellness and cancer and champions the Seven Pillars of Prevention and Early Detection (see sidebar). Registered Dietitian Karen Connelly collaborates with Dr. Lue when the duo educates women about healthy living. Connelly provides medical nutrition therapy to inpatient breast cancer patients and also sees outpatients at the Steeplechase Cancer Center. \"Cancer has touched my own family,\" says Connelly, who is certified in oncology nutrition. \"Good nutrition can make a huge difference to quality of life. It can help prevent cancer from happening or recurring and can reduce side effects for people going through radiation or chemotherapy, keeping them stronger during treatment.\" ONE HEART. MANY HANDS The Sanofi US Breast Care Program includes a multidisciplinary team of medical oncologists, surgical oncologists, radiation oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, medical physicists, plastic surgeons, radiation therapists, certified oncology nurses, nutritionists, genetic counselors, nurse navigators and pharmacists. Support specialists from social work and psychology, pastoral care, rehabilitation and complementary therapies bring an added dimension. One of the few programs in New Jersey to achieve full recognition from the National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers, it is also recognized as a Breast Imaging Center of Excellence by the American College of Radiology. Together with the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, the Steeplechase Cancer Center offers patients the opportunity to take part in the latest clinical trials, including those for breast cancer. \"Our doctors and staff are focused on each patient as an individual,\" says Dr. Lue. \"We're dedicated to the best possible outcome and do everything in our power to make it happen. Because not one approach fits every woman, we tailor services to meet each person's needs\u2014from prevention education to regular screenings all the way through diagnosis, targeted treatment and into survivorship.\" Each year, an estimated 246,660 women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer. In New Jersey, the rates are slightly higher than the national average. Fortunately, survival rates continue to improve\u2014thanks to better detection and treatment methods, coupled with easy-to-follow lifestyle strategies. This powerful combination is in full swing every day at the Steeplechase Cancer Center at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset, where breast specialists work hand in hand with wellness experts. Through an integrated team approach, the Sanofi US Breast Care Program educates and empowers women, teaching lifestyle strategies that help prevent cancer and using the latest medical and surgical approaches to treat it if it does occur.

The new unit has a spacious opening so we can take all comers. It also has metal-correction software allowing us to better serve people who have orthopedic metal implants, which can cause imaging distortions in a typical MRI machine.\" Other new technology includes a Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) scan for localizing bone lesions and a Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT) scan for oncology patients. Healthy Together | 6 | Fall 2018 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset | RWJBH.ORG/SOMERSET | 7 Somerset_Radiology_Fall18_final.indd 6 9/30/18 1:14 PMMORE SPACE FOR PATIENTS The Radiology Department has moved completely to digital imaging over the years, eliminating the need for storing hard-copy films. This digital transformation has increased connectivity at RWJUH Somerset and freed up physical space. \"We reclaimed a large storage room and repurposed it for patient use as part of our department's renovation,\" explains Dr. Lazar. He says that the extensive makeover has fulfilled two goals: \"We've modernized our physical plant and created separate, unique imaging experiences for our inpatients and outpatients.\" The separated areas provide hospitalized patients the privacy they need, while at the same time creating the look and feel people have come to expect from freestanding imaging centers.NEW OUTPATIENT FOCUS The modern, airy space, decorated in a soothing blue shade with teak furnishings, roomy chairs and flat-screen TVs, offers greater handicap accessibility. \"The renovated outpatient area provides a more comfortable and relaxing experience for patients,\" says Paulette Duckrey, Radiology Department director. Additional spaces include locations where patients can comfortably change into gowns prior to exams, as well as new areas where they can consult privately with radiologists. Duckrey says the addition of a registration desk within the waiting area is another significant improvement. Previously, patients registered in the lobby and traveled down the hall to Radiology. \"It's one-stop shopping now with patient scheduling and imaging done in the same area,\" says Duckrey, noting that same-day appointment scheduling is readily available. SUB-SPECIALTY RADIOLOGISTS \"Our medical center is staffed by a large radiology group that focuses on sub- specialization,\" says Dr. Lazar. \"This means our patients' images are directed to radiologists with advanced training in the area of clinical concern. Patients are cared for here by many of the best radiologists and technologists in the state.\"\"WE'VE MODERNIZED OUR PHYSICAL PLANT AND CREATED A SEPARATE UNIQUE IMAGING EXPERIENCE FOR OUR INPATIENTS AND OUTPATIENTS.\" ERIC LAZAR, MD, CHAIR, RADIOLOGY DEPARTMENT Opposite page: The larger opening of the new GE Optima MRI improves patient comfort.

To see real health benefits, Dr. Micek-Galinat says dietary improvements must be part of an overall lifestyle change. She offers these steps to a happier, healthier life: Drink lots of water Get a good night's sleep Practice stress management Follow a healthy diet Don't forget to laugh Be physically active Build social connections COOKING UP HEALTHLAURA MICEK-GALINAT, MD, TEACHES NUTRITION AND GOOD COOKING HABITS TO HELP PATIENTS RESTORE AND MAINTAIN HEALTH. While garlic adds unbeatable flavor to a marinara sauce, it also packs a powerful health punch. This superfood, a trusted remedy through the ages, has been linked to a stronger immune system and a reduced risk of diseases. But, did you know that how you handle garlic impacts its nutritional power? \"Smash the bulb and set it aside for 10 minutes before peeling, dicing or cooking. It releases healthy compounds that have great anti-cancer properties,\" says Laura Micek-Galinat, MD, a board-certified family medicine physician who completed a fellowship in integrative medicine under Andrew Weil, MD. Dr. Micek-Galinat also is certified in culinary medicine, a new evidence- based field that blends the art of cooking with the science of medicine. She uses her unique training to empower patients, offering easy-to-use lifestyle tips that move medicine from the doctor's office into the kitchen. FOOD AS MEDICINE \"I've always been fascinated by the medicinal properties of food,\" says Dr. Micek-Galinat. \"The anti-inflammatory diet, which combines the healthiest parts of the Mediterranean and Asian diets, is rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats and fish. It also incorporates a variety of spices.\" Turmeric and black pepper, for example, offer proven health benefits separately. When mixed together, they're even stronger\u2014improving cognition, alleviating pain\u2014even working to prevent cancer. REAL FOODS ARE THE BEST FOODS The typical western diet\u2014high in saturated and trans fats, processed meat, sugar and salt\u2014promotes widespread inflammation in the body. \"Don't eat food out of a box,\" encourages Dr. Micek-Galinat. \"Eat real foods that your great-grandmother would've prepared.\" Dr. Micek-Galinat provides one-on-one consultations tailored to individual health needs and goals. To make an appointment for a culinary medicine and integrative health consultation, call 908-685-2900. LAURA MICEK-GALINAT, MD, family medicine physician and certified culinary medicine specialist Healthy Together | 8 | Fall 2018 Somerset_Culinary_Fall18_final.indd 8 9/30/18 1:04 PMThe state's largest integrated health system, RWJBarnabas Health, and Rutgers University, one of the nation's leading public research universities, have formed a groundbreaking partnership that will increase access to care and reduce healthcare disparities, while advancing health science discovery and innovation. RWJBarnabas Health will make a significant investment in recruiting and retaining the nation's finest doctors, researchers and medical students. That means more expert physicians to care for patients and more clinical trials to find better treatment options. Moreover, everyone on this dynamic new team has a mission to deliver excellence in every area of the patient experience. Altogether, the partnership means a transformation of the way healthcare is delivered in New Jersey. That's the big picture. What's the personal picture for you and your family? You'll be able to get compassionate, world-class care without having to travel far from home. In the following pages, we'll share more good news about what this partnership means for you.

LIBUTTI, MD, FACS If you've read or watched anything about medical care in recent years, it's clear that the field of medicine is always advancing. How do medical treatments improve? Through clinical research or clinical trials. Doctors, nurses and scientists gather information through personal interaction with patients, or through collection of blood, tissue or data, to find new and better ways to detect, diagnose, treat and prevent disease. When this research takes place in New Jersey, residents have the ability to participate in those clinical trials, and to be among the first patients to benefit from new treatments. Those opportunities will increase dramatically as a result of the RWJBarnabas Health/Rutgers partnership, which will double the Rutgers research portfolio\u2014already the largest in New Jersey\u2014and make it possible to hire about 100 new high-caliber principal investigators (lead researchers). EXPANDING CANCER CARE The Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey offers a prime example of how the partnership between Rutgers and RWJBarnabas Health will enhance both clinical research and patient care. Under the new partnership, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey\u2014the state's only National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center\u2014is now able to more easily provide patients with greater access to outstanding cancer services and clinical trials close to home. \"For many cancers, standard therapy may not be sufficient to have the greatest success for an individual patient,\" says Steven K. Libutti, MD, FACS, Senior Vice President of Oncology Services for RWJBarnabas Health and Director of the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey. \"We're constantly looking for the next generation of therapies that will be more effective, and the only way we make those discoveries is through the conduct of clinical research.\" Immunotherapy, in which a person's immune system can be used to fight cancer, is just one of many cutting-edge areas of study at Rutgers Cancer Institute. ACCESS EVERYWHERE Thanks to the new partnership, more cancer patients will have access to the most advanced care. Rutgers Cancer Institute will leverage telemedicine and video conferencing to bring experts at different sites together with patients. \"We're also expanding the number of patient navigators we have in our program,\" says Dr. Libutti. \"These navigators are essentially partnered with a patient from the moment of diagnosis throughout his or her care. They can make certain the patient goes to the closest facility that has the capability to address that patient's particular cancer problem with exceptional treatment.\" For New Jerseyans who have cancer, home is where the care is. \"The significance of this partnership is really our ability to bring cutting-edge therapies, state-of-the-art technologies and world- class physicians directly to patients in their own community,\" Dr. Libutti says. \"We strongly believe in the notion that cancer does not travel well. No patient in New Jersey has to travel out of state to get the most advanced and exceptional cancer care.\"KNOWLEDGE IS POWER HOW IN-STATE CLINICAL RESEARCH CONNECTS TO BETTER CARE FOR NEW JERSEY PATIENTS.

That's the guiding idea behind the Combined Medical Group, a joint physician practice that will be a key part of the partnership between RWJBarnabas Health and Rutgers. \"Having a shared purpose, a vision and a set of core values excites our employees and physicians and other healthcare professionals,\" says Andy Anderson, MD, MBA, Chief Executive Officer of the Combined Medical Group. \"They want to be part of something that's going to help define the future of healthcare.\" RWJBarnabas Health and Rutgers are engaged in a partnership, not a merger, so each remains a separate institution. The practitioners at RWJBarnabas Health and the faculty practice of Rutgers- employed health- care professionals (including physicians, dentists, psychologists, nurses, pharmacists and others) will collaborate and innovate as a team. The Combined Medical Group will include approximately 5,500 physicians, providers and staff. VISION INTO REALITY In order to integrate their efforts seamlessly, the group needs a common purpose. \"We're focused on three areas,\" explains Dr. Anderson, who comes to the partnership from a similar role at Aurora Health Care in Wisconsin. \"Those areas are: making sure we put patients first, valuing each member of the healthcare team and improving the health of the communities we serve.\" That three-part purpose has to touch every aspect of the patient's experience, Dr. Anderson believes. \"Healthcare is not only about hospitals. It's also about office practices, home-care services, access to medications and more,\" he says. \"We want to better connect all those pieces and parts to make it easier for patients.\" The effort will include a review of the electronic medical records system. \"In the future state of the health system, a patient will be able to look at their medication list or next appointment, get reminders or get lifestyle recommendations, all through a single portal,\" Dr. Anderson says. A FOCUS ON WELLNESS The vision also includes focusing more attention on helping patients stay well. For example, having staff and providers talk more with patients about lifestyle habits can give them better control over chronic diseases like diabetes. Though the goals of the Combined Medical Group are ambitious, they are also, in a way, simple. \"We want to be the health system where patients want to get care,\" Dr. Anderson says, \"and where people want to work.\"CARING WITH PURPOSE A NEW VISION FOR HEALTHCARE UNITES PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS.For a referral to a Combined Medical Group physician, visit rwjbh.org/medicalgroup or rutgershealth.org.

To learn more about neurological services, treatment and care at RWJBarnabas Health, visit rwjbh.org/neuro.Many critical conditions fall under the scope of a neurosurgical team: stroke, concussion, trauma to or infection in the brain or spine, and more. While Rutgers and RWJBarnabas Health already place among the top tier of neurosurgical care providers, their partnership is allowing the creation of a neurosciences institute of global renown. \"This is a unique opportunity to build a truly world-class center,\" says Anil Nanda, MD, MPH, the newly appointed Senior Vice President of Neurosurgical Services for RWJBarnabas Health. Dr. Nanda also will serve as Professor and Joint Chair of the Department of Neurosurgery at both Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and Rutgers-New Jersey Medical School. He comes to his role from Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center\u2014Shreveport, where he built an internationally known department of neurosurgery. FOCUSED ON QUALITY \"Our challenge here in New Jersey is to build on different cultures in the medical schools and in different hospitals and create a unified system,\" Dr. Nanda says. Among his top priorities are to look at safety; to identify whether all sites have the cutting-edge technology they need; and to do a sophisticated data analysis of outcomes. \"We've hired a biostatistician and an epidemiologist to help us create a neurological dashboard to look at safety and quality issues across the system,\" he explains. While good data and technical expertise are critical, they're only part of successful neurosurgical care, Dr. Nanda says. \"We want to do this in a compassionate setting, to treat patients like we would want our families treated,\" he says. Public health outreach on topics like concussions and stroke will be a priority, as will looking at ways to eliminate disparities in healthcare. \"We want to make sure patients get very good care, even if they live in communities that are economically challenged. That's very important to me personally,\" Dr. Nanda says. \"And I feel strongly that in the neurosurgical services line, a rising tide brings healthcare up for all people in New Jersey. That's why this is a magnificent partnership, with a strength in numbers that will allow us to provide excellent care to all.\"RUTGERS PARTNERSHIP A SPORTS SLAM DUNK RWJBarnabas Health and Rutgers University have partnered to develop an outstanding sports medicine program for Rutgers athletes, students and faculty, as well as for communities throughout New Jersey. The combined effort includes a new state-of-the-art athletic facility, the RWJBarnabas Health Athletic Performance Center, scheduled to be completed in July 2019.

Last April, Omar Shehabeldin, 14, was running for a school bus when he felt a \"pop\" in his knees and fell\u2014hard. Instead of going to a track meet as he'd planned, he was taken to the Emergency Department at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital New Brunswick. Both knees appeared to be broken. In fact, the tendon that connects the patella (kneecap) to the tibia (shin bone) had basically torn off in both legs. The tendons had to be surgically reattached with a type of hardware that looks like nails. What had happened to cause such drastic injuries to the athletic Omar, who as a high school freshman was already a standout on the football team? In fact, his family had long known he had Osgood-Schlatter disease, a not uncommon cause of knee pain in children. Bones, muscles and tendons change rapidly during growth spurts, and physical activity puts extra stress on them. \"It started when Omar was younger,\" says his mother Aliaa Gouda. \"When he got on the floor to pray with his father, he would complain that his knee hurt. The doctor told us that he would outgrow it, as most children do.\" Unfortunately, Omar was an exception. WORKING IT After surgery, Omar was sent to Children's Specialized Hospital in New Brunswick for rehabilitation. \"We stayed in close touch with the pediatric orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Stephen Adolfsen, who wanted to be sure the knee bones and patella had really fused before Omar began to bear weight on his legs,\" says Michele Fantasia, MD, a specialist in pediatric rehabilitation medicine at Children's Specialized Hospital. \"We worked with Omar on upper body and upper extremity training and core strengthening, all while he was in a special wheelchair that elevated his legs.\" In June, Omar was cleared to walk with braces. In therapy, he began to bend his knees, bit by bit. Omar was fortunate to have the considerable resources of Children's Specialized, which include recreational therapy activities, water therapy and a therapy dog named Burton. \"Our staff has experience in all developmental stages, and we are equipped with multiple therapeutic modalities,\" Dr. Fantasia says. Omar was discharged on June 21 and continues to go to the hospital for outpatient rehab. \"Everybody at that hospital works with so much heart. It is a great place,\" his mother Aliaa says. \"In fact, we're going to go back and volunteer to help people there.\" To learn more about Children's Specialized Hospital, call 888-244-5373. MICHELE FANTASIA, MD BACK ON TRACK\"Omar was very motivated and upbeat in physical therapy,\" Dr. Fantasia says.

What he or she may not feel is ready to accept help. \"That's where the magic of our Peer Recovery Program comes in,\" says Connie Greene, MA, CAS, CSW, CPS, Vice President of the RWJBarnabas Health Institute for Prevention and Recovery (IFPR). Peer Recovery Specialists\u2014 highly trained individuals who are in long-term recovery from their own substance use disorder\u2014are available 24/7 at participating RWJBarnabas Health Hospitals through the Peer Recovery Program (PRP). \"Recovery Specialists are the best people to assess where this patient is at and how to engage him or her, because they've been in that bed,\" Greene explains. \"That's a great relief for a person who may be isolated and may have exhausted relationships and resources.\" The goal of a Peer Recovery Specialist\u2014one that often takes some time to achieve\u2014is to get the person to agree to go to the next appropriate level of care, and to help him or her navigate the steps needed to maintain recovery. NEW TACTICS FOR AN EPIDEMIC In 2016 and 2017 alone, approximately 2,200 New Jerseyans died of overdoses. As part of the effort to reverse the tide, the IFPR staff has, with the help of state funding, gone from about 30 employees to about 160 over the past two and a half years. The Peer Recovery Program is one of the innovative tactics the IFPR is using in its fight. In the past, patients who were brought to an emergency room with an overdose were given NARCAN to reverse the overdose, then sent on their way. Since 2016, participating RWJBarnabas Health hospitals have integrated Peer Recovery Specialists into ER teams, where they follow up with the patient and provide continuing support.Now the Peer Recovery Program is functioning on medical floors as well. \"Federal statistics tell us that between 9 and 10 percent of the population has a substance use disorder,\" Greene says. \"So if you follow the data, up to 10 percent of the patients in our hospitals are affected.\" Formerly, when a patient who was in the hospital for a different reason presented signs of a substance use disorder, physicians were often at a loss about how to proceed. Now Peer Recovery Specialists can be called in to come to the bedside, offer an intervention and guide the patient to the care that's needed. \"It's a very, very difficult job, but there is also the joy of holding someone's hand as they move into recovery,\" Greene says. Of the 5,500 people the Peer Recovery Program has interacted with, 85 percent have accepted recovery support services. The blessings ripple out to family members as well. \"Every morning when I see the whites of my son's eyes and hear him say 'Hi, Mom,' I want to cry, and then call you to thank you,\" one mother wrote to the Recovery Specialist who worked with her son. \"May peace be with you on our journey as well\u2014one day at a time.\"For more information about the Institute for Prevention and Recovery, visit rwjbh.org/ preventionandrecovery.

Healthy Together | 14 | Fall 2018 System_Behavioral_Fall18_final.indd 14 10/1/18 4:08 PMTAME HYPERTENSION BEFORE KIDNEY DAMAGE OCCURS. The heart beats steadily, creating pressure that moves blood through the body to nourish tissues and organs. But when that pressure is too high\u2014a result of obesity, genetics or other factors\u2014the walls of blood vessels are damaged. They get weaker, narrower or harder. Over time, the force of high blood pressure, or hypertension, can impair the arteries' ability to deliver sufficient blood to the kidneys. In turn, kidneys can't fully perform their critical function of removing waste products and excess fluid from the body. \"There is a clear relationship between hyper- tension and renal failure that many To learn more about kidney transplant services at RWJBarnabas Health, visit www.rwjbh.org/kidneytransplant.

Isabel Roberti, MD, PhD, Director of the Children's Kidney Center at Saint Barnabas Medical Center. \"Now the recommendation is for blood pressure screenings to begin as early as age 3.\" A \"silent\" disease, hypertension can go undetected without regular screening. \"The earlier we catch hypertension, the better,\" says Dr. Roberti. \"Damage due to high blood pressure in children and teens is reversible, and action now can prevent their having kidney problems as adults.\" The good news is that, in both children and adults, hypertension is treatable with a multi-pronged approach including medication, diet changes and exercise.

David Solomon of Edison had always loved his three-mile walks with his dog, Rico, by his side. Along with the 60-year-old IT professional's commute to New York City, those treks were part of his daily routine. But in 2016, David was diagnosed with bone- on-bone arthritis in his hips. \"I started using a cane when I walked the dog,\" he says. His mobility grew worse. Climbing the stairs at Penn Station became increasingly difficult and donning socks and shoes required adaptive devices. Realizing that anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroid injections weren't enough, David began researching total hip replacement\u2014a surgical procedure in which the head of the femur (thighbone) and its socket are replaced. More than 340,000 people get a \"new hip\" in the United States each year, a number that's expected to grow to 500,000 by 2030, according to the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons. ANTERIOR APPROACH David learned that advancements in long-lasting materials and minimally invasive techniques have made hip replacement surgery a viable option for patients at increasingly younger ages. \"There's no reason to wait,\" says Stephen Kayiaros, MD, an orthopedic surgeon with the Joint Surgery Program at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset. \"Advancements in implant technology have improved longevity, and the anterior approach makes the recovery quick these days,\" he continues. \"People want to get back to work, sports and activities without a lot of downtime. My patients are on their feet within a day.\" Part of an elite group of orthopedic surgeons nationwide who are trained in anterior hip replacement surgery, Dr. Kayiaros performs more After having both hips replaced using the anterior approach, David Solomon is back taking long walks with his dog, Rico. For more information about Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset's Joint Surgery Program, visit rwjbh.org/somerset. For a referral to an orthopedic surgeon, call 888-MD-RWJUH. Healthy Together | 18 | Fall 2018 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset | RWJBH.ORG/SOMERSET | 19 Somerset_HIP_Fall18_final.indd 18 9/30/18 1:08 PMthan 250 of the procedures each year. \"The hip joint is deep and covered by layers of muscle,\" he explains. \"Traditional back (posterior) or side (lateral) approaches involve cutting muscles and detaching tendons and ligaments. The anterior approach allows me to go between muscles without cutting them\u2014through one small incision in the front (anterior) of the hip.\" Because the gluteal muscles that attach to the pelvis and femur are undisturbed, they don't require a healing process. At RWJUH Somerset, which has earned the Joint Commission's Gold Seal of Approval for total hip and total knee replacement surgery, the orthopedic operating suite is equipped with a HANA surgical table, a high-tech operating table used exclusively for anterior hip replacements. \"The table allows me to look at the hip and pelvis in an anatomic position,\" says Dr. Kayiaros, who uses X-ray guidance to ensure precise positioning. He completes the procedure in about an hour. TWO AT ONCE David was heartened when he discovered that Dr. Kayiaros was skilled in the anterior approach and that the procedure could be done close to home at RWJUH Somerset. Dr. Kayiaros scheduled David for a bilateral (double) hip replacement in April 2018. David felt ready for surgery following preadmission testing and a joint-education class at the Joint Surgery Program led by a registered nurse who serves as the hospital's joint-care coordinator. \"I received a binder filled with everything I needed to know for my hospital stay and return home,\" he says. David also toured the John and Mary Obzansky Pavilion, a 35-bed unit specializing in orthopedic surgery that features large, private patient rooms. Surgery went smoothly and David was up and pushing a walker accompanied by a physical therapist within hours. He was discharged the next day after meeting PT and nursing criteria. \"The goal was to walk 300 feet and I managed 600,\" says David. Home nursing and PT services were arranged for the first week. \"My PT arrived bright and early and we got right to work,\" he recalls. David met his personal goal and was back in his office by Memorial Day. \"I walk up steps easily now, without looking at my feet. I'm completely mobile and have no restrictions.\" Best of all, dog walks are longer, faster and enjoyable again.*Zawadsky MW, Paulus MC, Murray PJ, Johansen MA. \"Early Outcome Comparison Between the Direct Anterior Approach and the Mini-Incision Posterior Approach for Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty: 150 Consecutive Cases.\" J Arthroplasty. 2014 Jun;29(6):1256-60.

Jesiah Kinsey's gender transition has been a life-changing experience. It's also been a long and complicated journey for the Franklin Park resident who began hormone therapy in 2016. Because there were no health centers nearby in New Jersey that catered to the needs of transgender patients, Jesiah traveled by subway to a New York City center that did. He was excited when the PROUD Family Health center opened one year later at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset in Somerville, just 15 minutes from his home. \"I'm 30 years old and hadn't had a primary care doctor since my pediatrician,\" admits Jesiah. He made an appointment with Lalitha Hansch, MD, a board-certified family medicine physician and the medical director of PROUD Family Health. PRONOUNS MATTER \"I felt right at home the minute I walked through the door,\" says Jesiah, recalling a sense of relief when he saw the rainbow flag hanging above the front desk. \"The Healthy Together | 20 | Fall 2018 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset | RWJBH.ORG/SOMERSET | 21 Somerset_LGBTQIA_Fall18_Rev1.indd 20 10/2/18 3:13 PMwhole staff\u2014from the receptionists to the nurses and doctors\u2014were so welcoming.\" Jesiah bonded with Dr. Hansch and felt the same level of comfort and safety with her as he had with his former pediatrician. \"Dr. Hansch is the right doctor to manage my care. She's warm and attentive and cares for me as a regular person and not as a trans person. That's everyone's right: to be treated as the he or she that they are. Some doctors haven't been educated and they don't know how to approach patients like me.\" Whether the action is outright, such as a provider refusing treatment, or a subtler level of discomfort in a waiting room, health care disparities exist for LGBTQIA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex, asexual or allied) individuals. Existing protections such as the Affordable Care Act, which prohibits health care providers and insurance companies from engaging in discrimination, are often not enough. Jesiah, who is several years through his transition and can now \"pass\" as a male, remembers early days when he was often \"misgendered,\" or mistaken as a female in medical settings. THE PROUD DIFFERENCE RWJUH Somerset, which has been honored as a Leader in LGBT Healthcare Equality by The Human Rights Campaign, is dedicated to improving the lives of LGBTQIA patients and their families. In January 2017, PROUD Family Health opened within RWJUH Somerset's Family Practice. Services include primary and preventive medical care for children and adults, hormone therapy and monitoring, HIV care, health education, counseling, support groups and referrals for specialty services such as endocrinology or surgery. The PROUD medical team includes Dr. Hansch and family medicine physician Ian Martinez, MD, as well as nurse practitioner Melissa Rivers-Richardson, DNP, RN, FNP-BC. An OB/GYN physician and a psychiatrist also see patients at the practice. Structured as a mini multi-specialty center, PROUD has its own phlebotomist to draw blood samples, as well as X-ray and mammography machines on-site. CONVENIENT CARE The center's location on the RWJUH Somerset campus gives patients easy access to hospital services such as emergency, radiology, cardiology, oncology, rehabilitation and an on-site Walgreens pharmacy. \"Our center's staff as well as our inpatient residents in family medicine have all been medically trained in how to safely manage care for the LGBT population. Staff throughout the hospital have also received sensitivity training,\" says Dr. Hansch. During Pride Month in June, New Jersey Commissioner of Health Shereef Elnahal toured PROUD Family Health and said, \"I learned a lot from patients and staff about the importance of delivering unbiased, compassionate and clinically appropriate services to the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender communities. For far too long, LGBT health\u2014especially the unique health-care needs of our transgender residents\u2014has been an afterthought in the health care community.\" Tony Cava, president of RWJUH Somerset, has announced the center's plans to expand with a dedicated office suite and additional services to meet patient needs. \"We're excited to grow our program,\" he says, \"and continue to lead the way in LGBTQIA health care in New Jersey.\" LALITHA HANSCH, MD PROUD FAMILY HEALTH SERVICES Primary medical care for children and adults Hormone therapy and monitoring HIV care Referrals for specialty services Health education and counseling Monthly support group for family members of transgender individualsOn a tour of the PROUD Family Health Center, L to R: Michellene Davis, Executive VP and Chief External Affairs Officer, RWJBarnabas Health; Trina Parks, Senior VP and Corporate Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, RWJBarnabas Health; Salvatore Moffa, MD, Chief Medical Officer, RWJUH Somerset; Potenza, Director of Programs, Garden State Equality; Shereef Ehnahal, MD, MBA, New Jersey Commissioner of Cava, President, RWJUH Somerset; Somerville Mayor Ellen Brain; Assemblyman Andrew Zwicker; Jackie Cornell, Principal Deputy Commissioner of Public Health Services.
