Rest assured, that's not my recommendation here. Our bodies are wonderful and complex and are actually really well equipped to perform detoxification processes on their own. You don't need complicated routines, supplements, or rituals to detox your body. If all of your organs are in proper working order and not overwhelmed by your current toxin load. The problem is that we live in an ever-increasingly toxic environment. Environmental pollution is rampant. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals are a part of most of our beauty and skincare products. Often, our bodies simply can't keep up with all of the detoxing required without a little bit of a helping hand. Furthermore, when our bodies are trying to get rid of toxins, some of the same systems that would normally be attending to our immune systems get compromised. We can't enjoy the same level of immune response we typically would if the body wasn't busy focusing on other activities. This is why it's important to support our body's natural ability to detox regularly. Sweat Out Toxins One of the easiest and most effective ways to help get toxins out of the body quickly is through sweating. Ideally, you should try to sweat in some way every day. The easiest and cheapest way to do this is by exercising. We know that exercise is amazing for the body and mind. It should be an important part of your life. But more than just helping our heart and creating a slimmer physique, exercise can help you to reduce your toxic load because it makes you sweat. Researchers have long regarded [moderate exercise](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254618301005) as a means of supporting your immune system. If you have access to a sauna, this can be another amazing way to sweat out those toxins. Studies have actually shown even [one session in a sauna](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3916915/) can increase your white blood cell count. And regular sweat sessions in the sauna have been linked to a decrease in the likelihood of [catching a cold](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2248758/). Eliminate Waste It may not be sexy, but [healthy digestion](https://www.drshellysethi.com/2020/01/9-easy-ways-to-improve-your-digestion/) and regular elimination are the cornerstones of great health. Bottom line \u2014 you have to have regular bowel movements to get toxins out of your body and ultimately support your immune system. One of the best and easiest ways to do this? Focus on fiber. Adding more fiber to your diet has a myriad of health benefits. [Fiber](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19335713/) is great for your heart, blood pressure, can help reduce blood sugar levels, and it also helps move food through your digestive system. Prebiotic fiber can also pass through your digestive system into the large intestine and provide a meal that strengthens and fortifies your [gut microbiome](https://www.drshellysethi.com/blog/6-ways-to-improve-your-gut-microbiome). Since the majority of your immune system lives in your gut, this can give the immune response a huge boost. Some of the best sources of fiber to incorporate into your diet include: - Beans - Legumes - Oats - Popcorn - Chia Seeds - Nuts - Berries - Apples - Artichokes - Asparagus - Green bananas If you've never really eaten much fiber before, you're not alone. Most of the population in the US eat a paltry 5-10 grams of fiber a day...That's a fraction of the recommended 28 grams per day that actually falls way short of the more ideal of 50 grams per day. If you've tried to start adding fiber into your diet and finding the gas and bloating difficult to bear, just remember to start slow. Adding in a little more fiber at a time is better than trying too much and giving up altogether. Your body can and will adjust to the increased fiber intake, just power through, adding a little bit at a time, and you'll notice the gaseous side effects start to wane. Don't Sweat The Small Stuff Remember, your immune system is a complex symphony that requires many parts of your body to function at their best in order to provide you with the most efficient protection. It's important to remember to practice good self-care, get plenty of rest, and listen to your body at all times. Reducing your stress levels can do wonders for your immune system, too. Other ways to support detox pathways and increase immunity include: - Taking a high-quality probiotic or eating true probiotic foods - Adding appropriate supplementation to your routine - Get out into the sunshine to help your vitamin D levels - Eat plenty of veggies and fruit - Try natural anti-microbial foods like garlic, oregano, thyme, and Manuka honey - Eliminate alcohol to support your liver, the master detox organ - Drink plenty of water throughout the day - Skip the sugar and excess salt found in processed foods - Eat sulfur-rich foods like broccoli to help eliminate heavy metals - Switch out chemical-laden health and beauty products for more natural versions - Start a meditation practice - Eat an anti-inflammatory diet Detox For The Win Hopefully, I've given you some ideas to begin your detox journey here, and I hope that you're able to see measurable results in your life and the strength of your immune system as a result.
