Carol teaches great easy-to-use, everyday tools each month at her \"Chakra Workshops\". This is truly a hidden hot-spot in Marin. - 5/12/2019 Carol's Tuesday evening meditations are astounding! Her profound guided meditation will leave you amazed! Not only did I \"go places\", but I also saw the pure light of my heart space. Divine light...bright, bright, bright light...what a connection. With Carol's guidance, everything is possible..and what a gift to yourself to get here and experience this spiritual car wash. Believe me, you will not be disappointed. Do it for YOU. "}
