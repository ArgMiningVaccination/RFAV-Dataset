The nursys.com Web site contains data obtained directly from the licensure systems ofmultiple boards of nursing through frequent, securedupdates. Employers and the general public can now verify licenses and receive a detailed report within minutes, free of charge.This report will contain the name, jurisdiction(s), license type,license number(s), compact status (multistate/single state),license status, expiration date, discipline against license anddiscipline against privilege to practice (PTP) of the nursebeing verified. Currently, nursys.com is the only verificationtool available that provides status of a multistate licensee'sprivilege to practice in remote Nurse Licensure Compact(NLC) jurisdictions. Nurses (Official License Verification for a Fee) When a nurse applies for endorsement into a state, verifi- cation of existing or previously held licenses may be required.A nurse can use Nursys.com to request verification of licen-sure from a Nur syslicensure participating board. A list of licensure participating nursing boards can be found atNursys.com. In order to be eligible for a multistate license in the Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC), the nurse must legally reside in anNLC state. An active, unencumbered, multistate licenseallows the nurse to practice in all NLC jurisdictions. Ques-tions about NLC eligibility and legal residency can be direct-ed to the board of nursing in the nurse's state of residency.

This new form of licensure andregulation will better protect the public by: Allowing competent nurses to provide care both physical- ly and electronically wherever care is needed; Providing the public ready access to and a choice of qual- ified nurses; Protecting clients against incompetent nurses or unsafe nursing care through better communication between boardsof nursing, cooperative disciplinary investigations andprompt reporting of disciplinary action; Benefiting employers of nurses by having a more mobile workforce and a convenient centralized database for verifica-tion of licensure credentials. Understanding the Basics The nurse licensure compact allows a nurse who resides in a compact state to hold ONE license in the nurse'sprimary state of residence and practice in all other states in which the compact is in effect. Primary state of residence iswhere the nurse holds a driver's license, pays taxes and/orvotes. The compact requires the nurse to practice according to the laws and regulations of the state in which the nurseprovides care where the patient is located at the time thecare is provided. The practice laws and regulations for manystates are available online. A nurse who is under discipline may be in a monitoring agreement, which restricts practice across state lines. If you hold a license in a COMPACT state and RESIDE in that COMPACT state, your license is a multistate license whichauthorizes you to practice in any other compact state. If you hold a license in a COMPACT state, but do not RESIDE in that compact state (reside in a non-compact state),your license is a single state license and it authorizes you to practice only in that compact state. For example, if you holdan Iowa nursing license, but do not live in Iowa, the license isa single state license and does not grant you the privilege topractice in any other state. If you are licensed in both Iowa and another compact state and RESIDE in the other compact state, your Iowa nurs-ing license will be administratively placed on inactive statusimmediately. Only one active license can be held by a licens-ee among the compact states. The compact does not supersede federal law. There- fore if you are employed in military service or work for thefederal government, you may continue to hold a nursinglicense in any state you choose. If you are working as a nursein a nongovernmental capacity, you are required to contactthe state board of nursing in that state to determine if a nurs-ing license is required. If you move from one compact state to another com- pact state and practice nursing, you must obtain a license inyour new home state. However, you may continue to prac- tice under the former home state license and the multistatelicensure privilege in the new home state for a period not t o exceed 30 da ys. a. The 30-days shall begin with the date of hire/employment in the new primary state of resi-dence. b. If the licensee begins employment before changing primary state of residence, the 30-days begins uponthe date that the licensee establishes the new pri-mary state of residence. For updates on compact information or a list of com- pact states go to: www.ncsbn.or g/nlc .htm Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC) Fact Sheet What Nurse Employers Need to Know www.ncsbn.org/nlc Definitions Compact: An interstate agreement between two or more states established for the purpose of remedying a particu-lar problem of multistate concern (Black's Law Dictionary). Party or Compact State: Any state that has adopted the NLC. Home State: The party state that serves as the nurse's pri- mary state of residence. Primary State of Residence: The state in which a nurse declares a principal residence for legal purposes. Sourcesused to verify a nurse's primary residence may include dri-ver's license, federal income tax return, Military Form #2058or voter registration. Remote State: A party state other than the home state where the patient is located at the time nursing care is pro-vided or in the case of the practice of nursing not involvinga patient, a party state where the recipient of nursing prac-tice is located. Nursys\u00ae: A database with a free public access website (www.nursys.com) that contains the licensure and discipli-nary information of all licensed registered nurses (RNs) andlicensed practical/ vocational nurses (LPN/VNs), as con-tributed by party states. Background The NLC allows a nurse (RN and LPN/VN) to have one mul- tistate license in the nurse's primary state of residency (thehome state) and practice in other compact states (remotestates), while subject to each state's practice laws and disci-pline. Lawful practice requires that a nurse be licensed or have the privilege to practice in the state in which the patient islocated at the time care is directed or service is rendered.This pertains to practice by physical or electronic means. Nurses holding a multistate license are allowed to practice across state lines, except when practice is limited to thehome state due to a restriction on the license or some levelof disciplinary action. Advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) are not included in this compact. APRNs must apply for licensure ineach state in which they practice unless exempted whenemployed in a federal facility. To view a map of compact states, visit www.ncsbn.org/nlc. Employer Verification of a Nurse's Licensure Status Employers need to verify the licensure status of all nurses seeking employment. Many state boards of nursing havegone paperless and no longer issue a wallet size licensecard. NCSBN's online verification system, Nursys\u00ae(www.nursys.com), provides licensure data obtaineddirectly from the licensure systems of boards of nursingthrough frequent database updates. It is important to verify licenses online with Nursys or with the state board of nursing where the nurse is licensed. All NLC states provide licensure data to Nursys. Many, but not all non-NLC states provide licensure data to Nursys. Toview a map of Nursys licensure-participating boards ofnursing, visit https://www.nursys.com/NLV/LicenseVerifictionJurisdictions.aspx. For those states that submit licensure data to Nursys, employers can verify a nurse's license and receive a Licen-sure Quick Confirm report at no cost by visitingwww.nursys.com. The report will contain the nurse's name,jurisdiction, license type, license number, compact status(multistate/single state), license status , expiration date, dis- cipline against license and discipline against privilege topractice.For those states that do not submit licensure data to Nursys, employers can verify a nurse's license via a board ofnursing website, however, they will not have access to thelicensee's licensure, discipline or privilege to practice statusin other states. To verify temporary licenses, employers must contact the board of nursing that issued the temporary license. Licensure and Privileges A nurse licensed in a compact state must meet the licen- sure requirements in the primary state of residence (homestate). When practicing on a privilege in a remote state, thenurse is accountable for complying with the Nurse PracticeAct of that state. Compact states may issue a multistate or a single state license. Employers should verify licensure status online. A nurse with an active multistate license has the privilege to practice in any of the remote states. The NLC laws allow for the nurse to hold only one active license in his or her primary state of residence. Employersshould not require the nurse to apply for licensure in aremote state when the nurse has lawfully declared a pri-mary state of residence based on where he or she pays fed-eral income tax, votes and holds a drivers license. A nurse who holds a license issued by a state that is not a member of the NLC has a single-state license that is onlyvalid in that state.

The course is designed specifically for the supervision role in the long term care patient setting. A board approved nursing program or an approved provider of continuing education must provide the course. The area community colleges offer courses. It is the responsibility of the licensed practical nurse to maintain his or her certificate documenting completion of the course. A licensed practical nurse is entitled to supervise without the educational requirement outlined above if the licensed practical nurse was performing in a supervisory role on or before October 6, 1982. Verification is required. If licensees are unable to obtain the course within the first six months of employment, the LPN must write to the Board explaining the reason a waiver of the LPN Supervisory Course is being requested. Licensed practical nurses who are enrolled full-time in a registered nurse program are not exempt from the course. However, an LPN who is a full-time student in an RN program and who is scheduled to graduate within one year, may request a waiver by writing to the board office. The request for a waiver must state the number of credit hours to be taken each semester and include the student's expected date of graduation. Individuals who do not graduate from the RN program as scheduled or who are not successful on the RN-NCLEX\u00aemust take the next available course.SUMMARY IOWA BOARD OF NURSING MEETING SEPTEMBER 15 - 17, 2010 Board Members Present: Jane Hasek, RN, Professional Staff Present: Lorinda Inman, RN, Executive Director Christine Newell, RN, Nursing Standards Kathleen Weinberg, RN, Practice/Education Dana Peterson, Enforcement Sandra Colin, RN, Enforcement Doug Bartels, Enforcement Taunya Cunningham, RN, Enforcement Kathleen Beebout, RN, Enforcement William Hansen, Enforcement Diane Burkert, RN, Enforcement Eric Holsapple, Enforcement Lynn Linder, Operations Officer Enforcement: 1.
