Examples of therapies and support programs: Yoga Therapy - This gentle yoga class addresses specific physical and emotional needs left by cancer and its treatments, such as stress, pain, fatigue, insomnia, depression. We focus primarily on breath work and body awareness. No experience necessary, and movements can be modified to accommodate any personal limitations. Guided Meditation - Patients and families can learn helpful techniques to cope with fear, anxiety, and stress related to illness. Reiki - An ancient Japanese form of energy healing in which hands are placed just off the body or lightly touching the body to transmit energy to the patient and activate the natural healing processes of the body. Reiki promotes deep relaxation, emotional well-being, and reduction in pain and other symptoms. Massage Therapy - Let massage reduce stress, promote relaxation, and foster a sense of well-being to speed healing. For our patients' convenience, some integrative therapies are offered on-site at no cost.
