It's a book that calls for reading. It tells us how to help the children of Tennessee fulfill their dreams. This budget includes major education initiatives intended to prepare our children and our workforce for the realities of the 21st Century economy. Reading is imperative to our children's future and our state's. Despite full funding of the Basic Education Program for several years - and despite the gains this has earned us in K-12 Education - our children cannot read as well as they should - and must. This failing reflects itself not only in early-grade reading courses, but in every subject our children study, throughout their school years. If our children do not read well, they do not function well in English, math, science, and social studies. These are things they must master - and they must master them now - if they are to be prepared for the economic future they are anxious to reach. For my Administration and the General Assembly, the future is now. We have analyzed our revenue problem and our choices for the past two years - through two regular sessions and two extraordinary sessions of the 101st General Assembly. The revenue problem is still here, and it is time to make our choices. We must do this to ensure the long-term economic viability of the people of Tennessee. We must do this to ensure we have the stable and fair tax structure necessary to allow us to make the right choices about the fundamental needs of the people - a safe, healthy childhood; excellence in education; economic opportunity; public health; public safety; natural resources; responsible government. This budget includes first-year funding of the Reading Initiative. This is a program, to be implemented over five years, that will focus on the educational problems and opportunities that the literacy report commissioned by the General Assembly says we should confront. The Reading Initiative has six components: (1) Reading Coaches, (2) Early Childhood Education, (3) Catching Up, (4) Teaching Resources - Quality Teaching, (5) Teaching Resources - Digital Enhancement, and (6) Teaching Resources - Classroom Materials. Reading Coaches will make reading by the end of the third grade a priority and will build upon those reading skills. We will have a reading coach in every K-12 school. Reading coaches will work with other teachers, and every teacher will have the chance to teach reading as part of every subject. The Reading Coaches program is the cornerstone of the Reading Initiative. The Early Childhood Education proposal will jump-start Tennessee educational opportunities. This program will offer Early Childhood Education to every four-year-old child by the 2005-2006 school year. Currently, 36,850 of these children are not served by a pre-school program. The first phase of the program, in 2001-2002, will serve 7,370 additional children and will focus on the educationally at- risk. This program will expand the Family Resource Center program by 110 centers, which will allow at least one in every county. These centers will help identify children at risk of educational failure, increase family involvement in schools, and help with the transition into school. Catching Up is essential to school-child success. Beginning in 2001-2002, Gateway tests will be more difficult. This program will provide targeted Catch-up activities for seventh and eighth grade students at risk of failing the tests during their high school years. This program also will provide professional development in math and science for middle-grade teachers. Teaching Resources will be improved under the Reading Initiative. Quality Teaching will result from enhanced scholarships to attract new teachers into subject areas where shortages exist; a teacher mentoring program to increase the likelihood of new teachers remaining in the field; incentives for national board certification; an electronic clearinghouse to match teachers and schools in job searches; and Teaching as a Second Career, a program to encourage professionals to earn teaching certificates in their fields. Teaching Resources also will be improved with funds to provide Advanced Placement courses through the internet in school systems now unable to offer these courses because of lack of teachers or small numbers of students. An additional $100 per teacher for Classroom Materials is provided in this budget, and this will double the amount now available to teachers. Providing proper materials is one of the most cost-effective ways to improve student achievement. The plan is to raise the materials allotment to $500 over the next four years. For Excellence in Higher Education, this budget provides funds for the second year of the five-year plan to achieve excellence. The funding is based on recommendations of the Council on Excellence in Higher Education and a funding plan developed in consultation with the Tennessee Higher Education Commission, the University of Tennessee, and the State Board of Regents. This second year of the Higher Education Excellence Initiatives includes funds for Faculty Retention and Recruiting in high- demand disciplines. We need to get and keep more outstanding professors; we must pay them better to do so. Currently, we cannot compete with public universities in surrounding states. I am again recommending additional funds for special equipment and research initiatives in both university systems; for technology initiatives; for a significant operating increase for higher education institutions andprograms, allowing them to add faculty and improve academic quality; and for an increase in student assistance grants intended to serve an additional 6,021 needy students. This budget offers program improvement choices in other critical areas: a) K-12 Basic Education Program full funding for the fifth straight year b) Geier Settlement Agreement for Higher Education desegregation c) Long-Term Care Alternatives for the elderly and disabled d) TennCare actuarial funding, rate increases, and program enhancements e) Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities services f) Public Health - Tuberculosis screening and treatment g) Families First high-performance federal bonus for Tennessee's leadership in reform h) Child Welfare services, implementing the third year of the reform proposal i) Prison capacity expansion and security increases j) Better probation and parole supervision, and more community corrections k) Law enforcement and crime investigation l) State Parks maintenance and natural resource protection m) Industrial infrastructure In addition, the budget provides funds for a 3 percent salary increase, effective July 1, 2001 , for state employees, higher education employees, and K-12 teachers; for the salary survey adjustment for Troopers; and for classification-compensation adjustments for state employees. We hold our employees accountable for effective management of State Government and delivery of services. We should adequately pay them for that work. Details of these initiatives and other improvements are explained in the Budget Document. Look closely at the education initiatives. They and other basic needs require raising of additional tax revenues. This budget is balanced. It is accompanied by a revenue proposal that taxes those who are not taxed and expands the sales tax base. It reduces the state sales tax rate, currently at 6 percent, to 4 percent and lowers the local option maximum rate. The maximum combined sales tax in the state would be 6 percent or less, making Tennessee retailers competitive with surrounding states. This proposal makes the excise tax apply to all businesses. It no longer permits owners to deduct that compensation they pay themselves in excess of $72,000, closing a loophole in our tax system. It further reduces the Hall tax on dividends and interest from 6 percent to 4 percent. This proposal also phases out death taxes completely in Tennessee when coupled with President Bush's tax plan. Our proposal is just one method to raise the necessary revenue. There are other ways to reach our common goal. We invite other proposals to fashion a fair and elastic tax structure. We will work closely and carefully with the General Assembly to reform our broken tax structure. All Tennesseans operating profitable businesses should pay taxes to the state.Read the budget. It's not easy. But it is important for our children's future that you do so. Give them the gift of Reading that this budget offers; help them Catch Up ; give them Quality Teaching. Offer them Excellence in Higher Education. Their future - and our legacy - depends on this. We can afford to do this; we cannot afford not to make the choices. Begin with Reading! My staff and I look forward to working with the members of the 102nd General Assembly on these initiatives, the Appropriations Bill, and related legislation. Sincerely, Don Sundquist Governor of the State of TennesseeSTATE OF TENNESSEE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION STATE CAPITOL NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE 37243-0285 C. WARREN NEEL, Ph.D. COMMISSIONER February 20, 2001 The Honorable Don Sundquist State Capitol Nashville, Tennessee 37243 Dear Governor Sundquist: It is my pleasure to submit to you the 2001-2002 Budget Document. Prepared in accordance with your directions, this budget emphasizes the critical need to better educate the children of Tennessee. They need to be prepared for life in this information age and be able to make the choices leading to economic opportunity and fulfillment of dreams. You had other choices, but you and I are not willing to recommend them, for they would lead to failure in school, failure in our commitment to Tennessee's children, and failure in our responsibility for our state's economic well-being. Those other choices also would represent failure in leadership and in responsible government. Your choices, instead - despite difficult structural revenue problems - offer hope for the future and investments which will allow children the opportunity not only to dream, but to live out their lives as productive citizens of Tennessee. This budget will allow major improvements in Tennessee education. The Reading Initiative, funded at $96.7 million in the K-12 Education budget for the first year of a five-year plan, has implications far beyond the classroom. So does the $92.4 million provided for the Higher Education Excellence Initiative. These improvements are essential to the long-term economic health of the people of Tennessee. Despite years of significant K-12 Education funding increases through the Basic Education Program (BEP) formula, our children's educational achievements fall short, compared with our neighboring states. Although the BEP improvements have reduced class sizes and kept pace with annual inflation in school costs, the funding formula increases have not addressed some of our major educational necessities. The Reading Initiative will provide a Reading Coaches program, which will make reading by the end of the third grade a priority and will continue reading emphasis through the eighth grade. The cost is $20.2 million. This will pay dividends in all school subjects, for inability to read well has consequences in math, science, and other subjects - and in the workplace.A second part of the Reading Initiative is Early Childhood Education, which is crucial to success of our children in the early grades and throughout their school years. At a first-year cost of $42.4 million, the Administration proposes to make Early Childhood Education available to all four-year-old children by the 2005-2006 school year. Currently, 36,850 four-year-old children are not served by pre- school programs; the first year funding will serve 7,370 and be directed toward educationally at-risk children. From the $42.4 million, $36.1 million will be provided for the academic part of the program, and $5.5 million will be provided for an additional 110 Family Resource Centers, which will allow funding for at least one center in every county. Currently, 30 counties do not have a Family Resource Center. These centers will help identify children at risk of educational failure, increase parent involvement in schools, and help with the transition into school. The Reading Initiative has a Catching Up component, designed to get all students prepared to pass the Gateway tests in high school. Funding for this improvement is $16 million, including $10 million for targeted catch-up activities for seventh and eighth grade students and $6 million for intensive professional development in math and science for middle grade teachers. More and better Teaching Resources are needed as part of the Reading Initiative. Quality Teaching, Digital Enhancement, and Classroom Materials will result in better Teaching Resources. Quality Teaching requires that we address K-12 teacher recruitment and retention. At a total cost of $7.6 million, Quality Teaching will provide enhanced scholarships targeted to specific subject areas where teacher shortages exist ($2 million); a mentoring program for new teachers, designed to keep them once we get them in the classroom ($4.4 million); a Teaching as a Second Career program that will encourage professionals to earn teaching certificates in their fields ($800,000); and national board certification incentives ($322,500). Teachers and schools involved in job searches will be linked through an electronic clearinghouse at a small cost. Under the Reading Initiative, Teaching Resources element, the Digital Enhancement program will provide funds for Advanced Placement courses through the internet in school systems now unable to offer the courses at certain schools because of lack of teachers or small numbers of students. For infrastructure and on-line curricula to implement this program, a $5 million improvement is recommended. Teaching Resources also will be improved in the Reading Initiative through a Classroom Materials element. At a first-year cost of $5.6 million, an additional $100 per teacher will be provided, and this will double the amount now available to them for materials. The goal is to raise the Classroom Materials allotment to a total of $500 over four years. For Higher Education, the $92.4 million recommended improvement is the second-year installment of a five-year plan to achieve Excellence in Higher Education. Last year, the General Assembly appropriated part of the funds you recommended for the current fiscal year. This initiative would address many of the goals recommended to you in the 1999 report of the Council on Excellence in Higher Education. The council set out a clear path to achieve academic excellence and place our public universities among the best in America. The funding plan also was developed in consultation with the Tennessee Higher Education Commission, the University of Tennessee (UT), and the State Board of Regents.Second-year funding recommendations for Higher Education Excellence include a state appropriation of $10 million for Faculty Retention and Recruiting in high-demand disciplines, to be matched with $5 million from student tuition and fees, for a total of $15 million, to make Tennessee public colleges more competitive with those in other states in attracting outstanding faculty. An operating increase necessary to attain Higher Education Excellence is recommended at $43.9 million for institutions and programs of Higher Education. This will improve library holdings, increase the number of faculty, improve instructional and laboratory materials, support technology initiatives, upgrade campus equipment, improve building maintenance, increase graduate student stipends, and address inflation of basic fixed operating costs. In addition, the Excellence Initiative includes $15 million for the two university systems, in order to upgrade special instructional and research equipment. Included is $4 million for special needs at the East Tennessee State University Quillen College of Medicine, with the remaining $11 million to be split between the Board of Regents institutions ($6.6 million) and the University of Tennessee ($4.4 million). This will address critical instructional, laboratory, and research equipment needs, particularly in technology areas. Higher Education Excellence requires more funds for research initiatives of the two university systems. Of the $12.5 million recommended, $7.5 million is for UT, as the second-year installment of a multi- year plan to enable the university to double federal research and development grants to $150 million per year and put UT among the top 25 public research universities by 2008. The total also includes $5 million for research initiatives in the Board of Regents system. This improvement also will require campus matching funds and will allow research institutions to develop major research activities and attract federal research grants. The Higher Education Excellence Initiative also includes $2 million for technology initiatives, which will provide debt service on $9 million in general obligation notes to buy infrastructure associated with technology initiatives. Higher Education Excellence - and improvement in educational attainment - requires that more students be able to receive student assistance grants to enable them to attend college. To serve an additional 6,021 needy students, increase the maximum grant level, and offset tuition increases, an increase of $9 million is recommended for student assistance grants. This also includes funds to increase the maximum grant level to the Tennessee Teaching Scholars program. Aside from the Excellence Initiative, the Higher Education budget includes an improvement to fund first-year costs of the Geier Settlement Agreement in the Higher Education desegregation case. In addition, the capital outlay budget for the two university systems totals $156.3 million, including $34.5 million for capital maintenance necessary to maintain existing buildings and infrastructure on our college campuses. This is funded by a combination of bonds and cash appropriations. In Health and Social Services, improvements are necessary in order to maintain adequate funding for the TennCare program and the child welfare programs of the Department of Children's Services.In TennCare, an improvement of $459.3 million is recommended, including $160.4 million from state appropriations, in order to maintain actuarial soundness of the program and deliver essential services. This will provide funds necessary for increased enrollment; for capitation rate increases for managed care organizations (MCOs) and behavioral health organizations (BHOs); for pharmacy inflation; for payments to federally qualified health centers (FQHCs); for rate increases for elderly and disabled services; for expansion of the Medicaid-eligible population receiving home and community services, in order to provide an alternative to nursing homes for 1,200 more clients; for home and community services for the developmentally disabled; for Department of Children's Services improvements; and for improved oversight and management of the TennCare program. In addition, the Aging Commission's program of home and community services for non-Medicaid eligible elderly and disabled clients will be expanded with a state appropriation increase of $2.5 million and a new federal grant of $2.7 million. In the Department of Children's Services, a total improvement of $33.6 million is recommended, including $23.9 million from state appropriations. This amount provides $13.7 million, including $7.4 million from state appropriations, for child welfare services, in order to reduce foster care caseloads, provide equitable foster care board rates, and otherwise improve child welfare. This is the third year of improvements addressing the recommendations of the Child Welfare League report. Other improvements recommended in this budget from state appropriations, reflecting choices to maintain and improve essential services to the people of Tennessee, include: a) Basic Education Program full funding for the fifth straight year - $19.4 million b) English as a Second Language in K-12 Education - $5.2 million c) Mental Health services - $4.2 million d) Developmental Disabilities services - $9 million e) Public Health - Tuberculosis screening and treatment - $5 million f) Prisons - Capacity, security, operational, and health services - $14.2 million g) Probation and parole supervision, and more community corrections - $3.1 million h) State Parks maintenance - $3 million i) Tennessee Industrial Infrastructure Program (TIIP) - $3.6 million As a result of Families First reforms, the state has received $9.6 million in federal Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) high-performance bonus funds. This federally funded improvement recognizes the state for being ranked seventh in the nation in the percentage of welfare recipients entering jobs. In addition, the budget includes $102.3 million in state appropriations to fund a 3 percent salary increase, effective July 1, 2001, for state employees, K-12 teachers and other local education personnel, and Higher Education employees; and $20 million for classification-compensation salary issues for state employees. The salary survey adjustment for Troopers also is recommended. These and other recommended program improvements are explained in detail in the Budget Document. Major improvements are highlighted at the beginning of each program statement section and in the detailed improvement listings in each section.The budget includes a total of 842 recommended improvement positions, including 835 in the Executive Branch. Of the total, 412 are for improved child welfare and other Children's Services programs. The Administration proposes to abolish at least 835 Executive Branch positions in order to offset the number of Executive Branch improvement positions in the recommended budget. The Budget fulfills the statutory mandate to be balanced. The additional revenue necessary to fund this budget is $785 million. As a companion to the general appropriations bill, the Administration is filing tax legislation which would raise the necessary revenue, although other tax options also could satisfy the revenue requirement. The Revenue Fluctuation Reserve will be raised from $165.1 million at June 30, 2000, to $283.5 million at June 30, 2002, based on this budget. This reserve allows services to be maintained when revenue growth is slower than estimated in the budget, mainly during economic downturns. We should maintain this fund for that economic circumstance, if at all possible. During the current fiscal year, however, it is possible that the undercollection of tax revenue could require some use of this so-called rainy day fund. I submit the 2001-2002 budget for your recommendation to the General Assembly. I look forward to assisting you and the General Assembly in considering the Reading Initiative, Higher Education Excellence Initiatives, other budget proposals, and related legislation. Respectfully Submitted, C.

A-49Budget Overview PrefaceState of Tennessee The Budget Document Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 2001-2002 Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 9-4- 5106, requires that the financial plan of Tennessee's state government be presented inthree parts: 1. Financial Policy The state's financial policy, contrasting the relationships between expenditures andrevenues that are estimated for the ensuingfiscal year with the corresponding figures forthe latest completed fiscal year and the fiscalyear in progress; 2. Bonded Indebtedness The state's bonded indebtedness detailing redemption requirements until retirement, thenet and gross debt of the state, and conditionof the sinking fund; and 3. Appropriations Bill The General Appropriations Bill, whereby the General Assembly gives legalsanction to the financial plan it adopts. Uponpassage, this bill appropriates by agency andfund the expenditures for the ensuing fiscalyear. The revenues by which theseexpenditures are financed are also detailed inthis bill. Parts one and two are included in the Budget Document. The format of the BudgetDocument is reviewed annually for clarityand content. Part three, the AppropriationsBill, is a separate document. The first section of the Budget Document, entitled \"Budget Overview,\" is abrief summary of the total budget, includingthe budget process itself. The roles of the various branches of government in the budget process aredescribed in \"The Budget Process\" narrative,within the laws; the Judicial Branch interpretsand enforces these laws; while the Executive Branch, headed by the Governor, has theconstitutional duty to administer and executeduties and functions that have been enactedinto law by the General Assembly. The \"Budget Process\" explanation is followed by a subsection entitled \"Basis ofBudgeting and Accounting,\" which explainshow the Budget is presented and some of themysteries of accounting. Following this information is a series of charts and schedules. The total state budgetand the General Fund budget are representedby charts that detail each tax type andfunctional area for the 2001-2002 fiscal year.Tennessee's current tax structure has themajority of its tax revenue coming from thesales tax, the largest portion of which fundseducation. The overview schedules clarify and detail the expenditures, revenue sources, andpersonnel requirements of state government.There are several total budget schedulescomparing programs by funding source andshowing how those funds are derived. Alsoincluded are tables that list, by department,the improvements proposed for the next fiscalyear. There are two charts that provide thetotal fund balance available, indicating thetotal requirement for appropriation and theGeneral Fund revenues available to meet thatneed. These two charts are titled \"GeneralFund and Education Fund, Comparison ofAppropriation Requirements and StateRevenues\" for fiscal years 2000-2001 and2001-2002. These charts show how thebudget is balanced against General Fund andEducation Fund tax revenues during thecurrent and next fiscal years. Due to itsunique funding source, the Department ofTransportation is highlighted separately withits detailed funding requirements. All agencies and departments are included in the summary comparisonschedules by program and funding source.The Budget Document Other schedules provide detail on the supplemental appropriations required tomaintain programs in the current fiscal year,the constitutional spending limitationrequirement, and a summary of personnel andfunding for all state agencies and highereducation institutions. Following the \"Budget Overview\" schedules is theAdministration's \"Tennessee Characteristics\" \"Economic Overview\"narrative discusses the relative trends andimpacts of Tennessee's economy on staterevenues. The Budget Document alsoincludes an historical analysis of the effect onthe state budget of federal aid trends andfederally mandated costs. The section entitled \"State Tax Revenues\" lists the various sources ofrevenue, the collecting agencies, and thestatutory apportionment among the variousfunds (primarily the general fund, educationfund, and sinking fund). Also listed are thecity and county funds and the highway fund.A comparison of collections by fiscal year ispresented on the remaining pages of thatsection. Included in the \"Financial Statements\" section are the comparative balance sheets forthe general fund, education fund, andhighway fund as of June 30 for the two prioryears. This schedule is followed by theexpenditures and requirements of the debtservice fund for the previous, current, andsubsequent fiscal years. The status of thevarious authorized and unissued bonds isgiven in a schedule of bonds andappropriations made for capital purposes inlieu of bond issuance. The statement ofbonded indebtedness presents the retirementschedule for the state's bonded debt. The costof outstanding bonds is reflected as principaland interest. The proposed capital outlay for the ensuing fiscal year is included within the\"Capital Outlay Program\" section. Specific projects are shown for each departmentimpacted, with the statewide capitalmaintenance effort included among the itemsfor the Department of Finance andAdministration. Whether from current fundsof the general fund, the sale of generalobligation bonds, or from other sources, theproposed funding for each project isindicated. The major portion of the Budget Document is \"Program Statements byFunctional Area.\" For presentation in theBudget Document, departments and agencieswith related missions, programs, goals, andobjectives are grouped, resulting in sixfunctional areas. This enables legislators,policy-makers, and concerned citizens to havea better concept of the magnitude and costs ofthe general responsibilities in stategovernment. At the beginning of each functional presentation is an introduction to theassociated agencies, followed by a list of theimprovement items that are recommended forthat area of state government. Theimprovement list is followed by tables thatshow the total expenditures, funding sources,and personnel of each functional area. The activities and responsibilities of the departments and agencies are explainedthrough narrative descriptions of eachprogram. Following this narrative, fiscal andpersonnel data are provided for the lastcompleted year, the current year, and theprojected year. Projected year data includesthe level of funding and number of positionsfor base, improvement, and recommendedtotals. At the end of each functional area program statement is a table of performancemeasures and information, covering the threeyears for which funding is displayed. The final section of the document provides a glossary of terms and an index topermit easy reference to specific departmentsor programs.State of Tennessee The Budget Process Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 2001-2002 Preparation of the Governor's annual budget for the State of Tennessee is theresponsibility of the Commissioner ofFinance and Administration, who has thetitle of State Budget Director. Within the Department of Finance and Administration, the Division of Budget isresponsible for budget development.Preparation, deliberation, and execution ofthe budget is a continual process throughoutthe year. This process regularly involvesthe legislative and executive branches, withoccasional counsel from the judicial branch.The following chart indicates the partici-pants in the budgetary process and anapproximate time schedule. Function Participants Schedule Planning and Budget Division July Estimation Departments and Agencies August September Preparation of Budget Division Octoberthe Budget November December Legislative General Assembly January-MayDeliberation Budget Execution Budget Division June-July Legislative CommitteesDepartments and Agencies Planning and Estimation Immediately after a new fiscal year begins each July, the staff of the Division ofBudget begins making plans for the budgetthat will be considered by the GeneralAssembly for the subsequent fiscal year.These plans include designing and updatingthe forms and instructions used bydepartments and agencies in presenting theirbudget requests to the Division of Budget. These automated forms and instructions are distributed to the agenciesin August. The deadline for completion andtransmission of the budget requests is thefirst of October. During this preparationperiod, the staff of the Division of Budget continually meets with agencies' fiscal andprogram personnel to answer questions andprovide assistance in developing theirbudget requests. In addition to projecting expenditure levels, estimates of the major revenuesources, such as the sales, franchise, exciseand gasoline taxes, are prepared for both thecurrent and next fiscal years. The revenueestimates are prepared by the Commissionerof Finance and Administration afterreceiving advice from the State FundingBoard, as required by TCA section 9-4-5202. All revenue estimates, includingestimates for licenses and fees, are part ofthe budget's overall review by theCommissioner of Finance andAdministration, the Governor, and theirstaffs. Preparation of the Budget Chapter 33 of the Public Acts of 1937 granted the Governor the authority and dutyto develop and submit to the GeneralAssembly a recommended budget. The lawdirects the Commissioner of Finance andAdministration to prepare the budget inaccordance with the Governor's directives. After the receipt of agency budget requests, analysts with the Division ofBudget begin the process of balancingexpenditures against estimated revenues.Within this constraint, funds must beprovided for Administration initiatives ofhigh priority, activities mandated by state orfederal statute, and the day-to-day operationof state government. Instructions for the agency budget requests include the submission of twolevels of requests: (a) a base request whichaccommodates the continuation of currentservices, and (b) an improvement requestwhich includes funds to implementmandated requirements, compensate forrevenue reductions, initiate new programs,The Budget Process or enhance the base level due to increased costs of providing current services. Following analysis of the requests by the Division of Budget, detailed recom-mendations are made to the Commissionerof Finance and Administration. Meetingsare convened with commissioners anddirectors of the departments and agencies bythe Commissioner of Finance and Admin-istration. A consensus is sought with theagencies as to the appropriate funding levelfor the upcoming year. After these meetings are completed, the Budget Division staff makes any revisionsthat have been agreed upon and presents theestimates to the Commissioner of Financeand Administration for his and theGovernor's consideration. The Governorand the commissioner review therecommendations resulting from thesehearings and consider necessary alterationsto fit within the scope of theAdministration's initiatives. Afterrecommendations have been finalized, thestaff of the Division of Budget prepares theBudget Document for printing. Meanwhile,work begins on the Governor's BudgetMessage. Both must be presented to theGeneral Assembly prior to February 1, or byMarch 1 when a newly elected Governortakes office, unless the General Assemblyby joint resolution allows submission on alater date. At the time the Budget Document and Budget Message are presented, theappropriation process is initiated. TheAppropriations Bill, prepared by theDepartment of Finance and Administration,is introduced and referred to the Finance,Ways, and Means committees of bothhouses of the Legislature. The variousstanding committees of the houses mayreview those parts of the AppropriationsBill that fall within their purviews. Thedepartments often are invited to testifybefore these committees on issues relatingto their budgets. After these committees report their reviews, the Finance, Ways, and Meanscommittees begin hearings on the budget inits entirety. Again, the departments maytestify and the Commissioner of Finance and Administration is invited to discuss thebudget recommendations. Considerationsmade by the committees might include thefiscal impacts caused by other billsintroduced by the members of both housesor individual amendments to theAppropriations Bill. The Finance, Waysand Means committees of each house reportout the Appropriations Bill with anyamendments they recommend. The Appropriations Bill then is sent to Calendar committees of each house to bescheduled for floor action. The Senate andHouse of Representatives must pass thesame Appropriations Bill in the same formfor it to be enacted into law. Approval ofthe General Appropriations Bill usuallyoccurs during the last week of the legislativesession. In signing the bill into law, the Governor may line-item veto or reducespecific appropriations. But the veto maybe over-ridden by a majority of both housesof the General Assembly. Tennessee has a tradition of enacting a single General Appropriations Act eachyear. Budget Execution When passage of the Appropriations Bill is complete and it is enacted into law,the execution of the act begins. Twoimportant concepts are involved: (a) thepreparation of work programs and (b) thedevelopment of allotment controls. Invariably, there are changes from the Budget Document as presented by theGovernor to the General Assembly and theAppropriations Act that is adopted.Analysts of the Division of Budget andfiscal personnel in the departments andagencies have the responsibility ofreconciling the approved AppropriationsAct with the Budget Document. This mayinvolve increases or decreases to the agencyallotments. The Division of Budgetestablishes an annual allotment for eachagency and division using the reconciledAppropriations Act. This annual allotmentis provided to the Division of Accounts as aThe Budget Process means of spending control. The agencies and divisions spend against these allotmentsduring the fiscal year. Budget execution is a process that continues throughout the fiscal year. Inaddition to the daily review of numerousoperational and personnel transactionrequests, the budget analysts must ensurethat the legislative intentions of theAppropriations Act are being complied withand carried out by the various departmentsand agencies. Further legislative review and control is maintained through the Fiscal ReviewCommittee, other oversight committees, andthe Finance, Ways, and Means committees. In addition to the review of agency activities by these bodies, the Finance,Ways, and Means committees must beinformed of any new or expanded programsresulting from unanticipated departmentalrevenues. These revenues usually are newfederal grants, but also may be otherdepartmental revenues. When notice ofunexpected revenue is received by anagency, the Commissioner of Finance andAdministration may submit an expansionreport to the chairmen of the financecommittees for acknowledgement. Uponthe chairmen's acknowledgement of theexpansion report, the Commissioner ofFinance and Administration may allot theadditional departmental revenue toimplement the proposed or expandedprogram. This expansion procedure is not used to increase allotments funded fromstate tax revenue sources. Noappropriations from state tax sources maybe increased except pursuant toappropriations specifically made by law. A transfer of appropriations between allotments for purposes other than those forwhich they were appropriated may not occurwithout the approval of the Commissionerof Finance and Administration and acommittee composed of the Speakers of the House and the Senate and the Comptrollerof the Treasury. Throughout the fiscal year, the Budget Division staff reviews the status of thevarious allotments and advises thecommissioner of Finance and Admin-istration of any problems. At the end of thefiscal year, the Division of Budget has theresponsibility of executing revisions to theannual allotments as a function of theclosing process. Audit and Review Post-audit and review are also functions that continue throughout the fiscalyear. Post-audit is a responsibility of theComptroller, an officer elected by theGeneral Assembly. The Division of StateAudit, within the Comptroller's Office, hasthe duties of conducting, supervising, andmonitoring the audits of all statedepartments and agencies. Intermediatecare facilities receiving Medicaid funds alsoare within the purview of this division. Inaddition, program audits are performed todetermine whether agencies are functioningefficiently. The General Assembly also participates in a continuing review throughout the fiscalyear. The Fiscal Review Committee, abipartisan committee composed of membersfrom both houses, meets regularly when theGeneral Assembly is not in session.Following a set agenda, members of thiscommittee review audit reports anddepartmental personnel respond to inquiriesabout activities and programs under thedepartment's jurisdiction. In addition,legislative oversight committees conductextensive review in areas of special interest,such as correctional issues and children'sservices. Joint legislative committees andsub-committees occasionally are appointedfor in-depth study of specific areas.State of Tennessee Basis of Budgeting and Accounting Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 2001-2002 Budgeting Basis The annual budget of the State of Tennessee is prepared on the modified accrual basis of accounting with several exceptions, principally the effect of encumbrance and highway construction contractual obligations. Unencumbered appropriations lapse at the end of each fiscal year, with the encumbered appropriations being carried forward to the next year. Most revenue collection estimates are presented on a modified accrual basis, consistent with the basis of accounting explained below. The law requires the Governor to present his proposed budget to the General Assembly annually. The General Assembly enacts the budget through passage of a general appropriations act. This act appropriates funds at the program level. Before signing the Appropriations Act, the Governor may veto or reduce any specific appropriation, subject to legislative override. Once passed and signed, the budget, in the form of the appropriations act, becomes the state's financial plan for the coming year. Budgetary control is maintained at the program level by the individual departments and agencies, acting in conjunction with the Department of Finance and Administration. The latter has a Division of Budget and a Division of Accounts to execute budgetary controls. The Budget Document details the separation between payroll and operational funds by program. Any movement of funds between the payroll and operational funds requires approval and a revision to the budget by the Budget Division on behalf of the Commissioner of Finance and Administration and the Governor. Other budget revisions during the year, reflecting program changes or intradepartmental transfers of an administrative nature, require certain executive and legislative branch approval, pursuant to law. This is discussed in detail in the \"Budget Process\" subsection.With proper legal authority, the Division of Budget, acting on behalf of the Governor and Commissioner of Finance and Administration, may execute allotment (or budget) revisions. The line agencies may not make these revisions themselves. In Tennessee, as in other states, appropriation of funds is a legislative power, not an executive power. No expenditures may be made, and no allotments revised, except pursuant to appropriations made by law. For Budget Document purposes, all funds are classified as General Fund except for the Department of Transportation (Transportation, or Highway, Fund), Capital Outlay (Capital Projects Fund), Facilities Revolving Fund, Debt Service (or Sinking) Fund, and Cities and Counties - State Shared Taxes (Local Government Fund). The Education Trust Fund, for which state tax revenues are estimated separately, is included in the General Fund in the presentation of the Budget Overview, although a separate fund balance statement for this fund is included in the \"Financial Statements\" section of the Budget Document. The presentation of all the operating budgets within the General Fund in the Budget Document, except for Transportation, is done for ease of budget presentation and understanding. In the Budget, revenue estimates for Special Revenue, Internal Service, and Enterprise Fund programs, funded by dedicated revenues, are included in the state tax revenue and departmental revenue estimates in the General Fund, as are those programs' expenditures. Special Revenue Fund programs reflected in the General Fund in the Budget Document are: Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency Tennessee Regulatory AuthorityBasis of Budgeting and Accounting Criminal Injuries Compensation Agricultural Resources Conservation Fund Grain Indemnity Fund Certified Cotton Growers' Organization Fund Agricultural Regulatory Fund Local Parks Acquisition Fund State Lands Acquisition Fund Used Oil Collection Program Tennessee Dry Cleaners Environmental Response Fund Abandoned Lands Hazardous Waste Remedial Action Fund Underground Storage Tank Environmental Protection Fund Sex Offender Treatment Program Small and Minority-owned Telecommunications Program Job Skills Fund 911 Emergency Communications Fund Real Estate Education and Recovery Fund Auctioneer Education and Recovery Fund Motorcycle Rider Education Driver Education C.I.D. Anti-Theft Unit Internal Service Fund programs reflected in the General Fund in the Budget Document are: Capitol Print Shop Claims Award Fund TRICOR Office of Information Resources Division of Accounts Postal Services Motor Vehicle Management Printing Purchasing Records Management Central Stores Food Services Program Enterprise Fund programs reflected in the General Fund in the Budget Document are:Tennessee Housing Development Agency Property Utilization Child Care Facilities Loan Fund In the \"Budget Overview,\" Education Trust Fund programs are presented in the General Fund, although the tax apportionments for the Education Fund are separately estimated. This, again, is done for ease of presentation and understanding of the budget. It also is done because the taxes earmarked and apportioned to the Education Fund are less than the Education appropriations, requiring General Fund tax support for Education programs. The programs in the Education Trust Fund are: (1) Department of Education (K- 12); (2) Higher Education, including state appropriations for the University of Tennessee, the State University and Community College System (Board of Regents), and the Foreign Language Institute; and, all funding sources for programs of the Higher Education Commission and the Student Assistance Corporation. In the Budget Document, certain institutional revenues for the two university systems are estimated. These include unrestricted educational and general revenues, (E&G), and auxiliary enterprise funds. Examples of unrestricted E&G funds are student tuition and fees; unrestricted state, federal, local, and private gifts, grants, and contracts; local appropriations; and sales and services related to academic programs. Restricted funds are not reflected in the Budget Document. Although presenting the operating budgets in this consolidated fashion makes the budget easier to understand, the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) does deal with all of the SpecialBasis of Budgeting and Accounting Revenue and other funds as separate from the General Fund. The Division of Accounts provides that document to the General Assembly and the public. Accounting Basis (From Division of Accounts, Comprehensive Annual Financial Report) The financial statements of the State of Tennessee are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). These principles require that the financial statements present the primary government and its component units, or the entities for which the government is considered to be financially accountable. Component units are discretely presented in a separate column in the combined financial statements to emphasize legal separation from the primary government. The financial activities of the state are classified into three fund categories and two account groups. The fund categories include governmental funds, proprietary funds, and fiduciary funds. Account groups are presented for general fixed assets and general long-term debt obligations. The state's governmental fund types include: General Fund - used to account for all financial transactions not required to be accounted for in other funds; Special Revenue Fund - used to account for specific revenues earmarked to finance particular or restricted programs and activities; Debt Service Fund - used to account for the payment of principal and interest on general long-term debt; and, Capital Projects Fund - used to account for the acquisition or construction of all major governmental capital facilities. All of the governmental funds are accounted for on the modified accrual basisof accounting. Under this basis, revenues are recognized when they become susceptible to accrual; that is, when they become both measurable and available to finance expenditures of the current period. Principal revenue sources accounted for on the modified accrual basis include federal grants, departmental services, interest on investments, sales taxes, petroleum and vehicular-related taxes and fees, and gross receipts taxes. Licenses, fines, fees and permits are accounted for on the cash basis. Expenditures are recognized when the related fund liability is incurred, except: inventories generally are considered expenditures when consumed; prepayments usually are not recorded; and principal and interest on long-term debt are recorded when due. Encumbrance accounting is utilized for budgetary control purposes in governmental fund types. Encumbrances outstanding at year-end are reported as reservations of fund balance for subsequent year expenditure. The state's proprietary funds include: Enterprise Funds - used to account for the operations of self-sustaining state agencies providing goods or services to the general public on a user-charge basis; and, Internal Service Funds - used to account for the operations of self-sustaining state agencies providing goods or services to other state agencies on a cost reimbursement basis. The proprietary funds are accounted for on the accrual basis. Under this method, revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred. The fiduciary funds represent Trust and Agency Funds that are used to account for assets held by the state in a trust or agency capacity. These funds include: Expendable Trust Funds - used to account for the activities of trusts whoseBasis of Budgeting and Accounting principal and income may be used for the purposes of the trust; Nonexpendable Trust Funds - used to account for the activities of trusts whose income is used to fund the trust purpose but whose principal is to be maintained intact; Pension Trust Fund - used to account for the activities of the state- administered retirement system; Investment Trust Fund - used to account for the activities of the state- sponsored external investment pool; and, Agency Funds - used to account for amounts held in custody of others. Expendable Trust and Agency Funds are accounted for on the modified accrual basis of accounting. Nonexpendable, Pension Trust, and Investment Trust Funds are accounted for on the accrual basis. Discretely presented component units include: Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation (TSAC) Community Services Agencies Tennessee Certified Cotton Growers Organization Tennessee Housing Development Agency Tennessee Local Development Authority Tennessee Commodity Producer Indemnity Board Tennessee State Veterans Homes Board Child Care Facilities Loan Corporation Tennessee State School Bond Authority In addition to the aforementioned fund categories and account groups, the component units also include colleges and universities that are accounted for using a different accounting and reporting model. The college and university fund types (discrete component units) include: Current funds - used to account for resources that will be expended in thenear term for operating purposes of the institutions; Fiduciary funds - used to account for assets held by loan, endowment, life income and agency funds in which the universities act in a fiduciary capacity; and, Plant funds - used to account for institutional property acquisition, renewal, replacement, debt service and investment. College and university fund types are accounted for on the accrual basis of accounting with the following exceptions: depreciation expense related to plant fund assets is not recorded; and revenues and expenditures of an academic term encompassing more than one fiscal year are solely reported in the fiscal year in which the term is predominantly conducted. Accounting Change 7-1-2001 GASB 34 Beginning July 1, 2001, Tennessee will be reporting financial information in accordance with the new reporting model, a rule of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board known as GASB 34. Some of the changes include the deletion of the Nonexpendable and Expendable Trust Funds from the Fiduciary funds and the addition of Permanent funds as governmental funds and Private-purpose trust funds as Fiduciary funds. Permanent funds will be used to report resources that are legally restricted to the extent that only earnings, and not principal, may be used for purposes that support the reporting government's programs. Private-purpose trust funds will be used to report trust arrangements under which principal and income benefit individuals, private organizations, or other governments. In addition, the new reporting model will require that the college and university academic terms that encompass more than one fiscal year must be split and recorded on a full accrual accounting basis.Budget Overview Summary Statements and ChartsTotal State Budget Where Your State Tax Dollar Comes From Gasoline Taxes 9\u00a2Motor Vehicle 2\u00a2Sales Tax 53\u00a2 Insurance & Banking 4\u00a2 Franchise & Excise 11\u00a2 Gross Receipts & Privilege 4\u00a2 Income & Inheritance 3\u00a2All Other Taxes 5\u00a2Tobacco, Beer, & Alcoholic Beverages 1\u00a2Tax Reform 8\u00a2 Where Your State Tax Dollar Goes Business & Economic Development 1\u00a2 Cities & Counties 7\u00a2Resources & Regulation 3\u00a2Education 43\u00a2 Health & Social Services 27\u00a2 General Government 2\u00a2 Law, Safety & Correction 9\u00a2Transportation 8\u00a2 Fiscal Year 2001 - 2002General Fund Budget Where Your State Tax Dollar Comes From Tax Reform 10\u00a2 Franchise & Excise 12\u00a2Insurance & Banking 4\u00a2All Other Taxes 5\u00a2Tobacco, Beer & Alcoholic Beverages 2\u00a2Sales Tax 60\u00a2 Income & Inheritance 3\u00a2 Gross Receipts & Privilege 4\u00a2 Where Your State Tax Dollar Goes General Government 2\u00a2Health & Social Services 32\u00a2Business & Economic Development 2\u00a2Education 50\u00a2 Resources & Regulation 3\u00a2 Law, Safety & Correction 11\u00a2 Fiscal Year 2001 - 2002Total State Budget Comparison of Programs and Revenue Sources Fiscal Years 1999-2000, 2000-2001, and 2001-2002 Actual Estimated Recommended Act. vs. Est.

I'm confident that the (GeneralAssembly) will...work with us...to solve this problem.The challenge before us today is how much more westill need to accomplish to get our state where everyTennessean wants to be. ... We know... that our children can't read as well as they should. Wedon't want our legacy to be that we failed to solve our problems. We don't want our legacy to bethat we passed them on to the next generation because we didn't have the courage to make thedifficult choices. ...

We have to dream a dream for them. \u2014 Governor Don Sundquist Tennessee Initiatives Low and Fair Taxes In both the First and Second Regular Sessions and in the First and SecondExtraordinary Sessions of the 101st GeneralAssembly, Governor Sundquist proposedcomprehensive tax reform to help solve thestate's budget crisis. The reform proposed in the First Regular Session in 1999 involved repealing the sales taxon grocery food and the Franchise and Excisetaxes. These three taxes would have beenreplaced with the Fair Business Tax, whichwould have taxed companies at a 2 \u00bd percenttax rate. The rate would have applied to acompany's taxable base. Governor Sundquist'sbusiness tax reforms would have applied taxesto the services sector of the Tennessee economyfor the first time. In response to the Governor'sproposals, the General Assembly amended theexisting Franchise and Excise taxes to requirequarterly payment. Governor Sundquist called special legislative sessions in March 1999 and inNovember 1999 to consider tax reform.However, both the First and SecondExtraordinary Sessions adjourned withoutvoting on tax reform legislation. In the Second Regular Session the Governor proposed the Comprehensive TaxReform Law of 2000. This law, if enacted, would have repealed the sales tax on groceryfood, reduced the general sales tax rate, repealedthe Hall Income Tax, reformed business taxes,reformed death and gift taxes, simplified taxfiling, and closed loop holes. In place of thesetaxes a 3.75% flat tax was proposed based onadjusted gross income. This tax reform wouldhave made our tax system less regressive, and itwould have assured the long term financialstability of our state. Even with this tax reform,Tennessee would have been one of the lowesttax states in the nation. None of these reformswas implemented by the General Assembly. The state still faces a revenue problem. Tennessee's regressive tax structure does notprovide adequate revenues to fund the basicneeds of the people of Tennessee, nor to keepthe state on a sound financial footing to provideneeded services. Because of the uncertainty ofour financial condition, national bond ratingagencies have lowered Tennessee's bond rating.This will make it more costly for us to borrowthe money we need to improve and maintain ourstate buildings, parks, and universities. Wemust find a fair and equitable way to fund abudget which provides a safe, healthy childhoodfor all children; excellence in education; good jobs today, better jobs tomorrow; a safe, clean, and healthy place to live, raise families, work,and retire. It is more important now than ever that Tennessee's tax structure be reformed. Thestate's economy has changed significantly in thelast 50 years, and our 1940's tax structure must change with it. We must have a system of taxesthat will address a 21st Century economy andthe 21st Century needs of the people ofTennessee. A Safe, Healthy Childhood for all Children Governor's Community Prevention Initiative for Children In January 1996, the Governor announced a major initiative aimed at reducing four high-riskbehaviors of youth - teen substance use/abuse,teen pregnancy, teen violence, and school drop-out. The high-risk behaviors are beingaddressed through community basedcomprehensive prevention programs that userisk factors to identify the target population andpromote protective factors in children under theage of thirteen. The initiative was designed to: Give communities input in assessing needs of the target population, assessingavailable resources, and in proposingsolutions to the identified needs Assure that community intervention facilitates the development of protectivefactors for at-risk youth before high-riskbehaviors develop by targeting childrenunder the age of thirteen Maximize the coordination of state and federal funding which is allocated toaddress any of these issues affecting youth Provide for comprehensive and coordinated services within thecommunity. The premise of the Governor's Prevention Initiative (GPI) is simple. In order to prevent aproblem from happening, we need to identifythe factors which increase the risk of theproblem developing and then find ways toreduce the risks that enhance protective factorsin children up through the age of twelve. Theage of twelve is the last, best chance to intervene with prevention strategies. The GPIprograms focus on strengthening protectivefactors within the family, school, andcommunity, which promote resiliency inchildren. Funds are provided for the GPI through the Departments of Health, Children's Services,Education, and the Commission on Children andYouth. TennCare for Children In 1997, Governor Sundquist extended TennCare coverage to every uninsured child inTennessee who does not otherwise have accessto health insurance protection, makingTennessee the first state in the nation to makehealth care coverage universally available tochildren. Although \"uninsured\" has been defined to mean lacking access to insurance, in 1998 theState extended TennCare coverage to poorchildren with access to insurance if they werepart of households earning no more than twicethe poverty level. TennCare copayments forthose families between 101% and 200% povertywere reduced, and deductibles were eliminatedaltogether. (There are no cost sharingobligations for enrollees whose family income isbelow the poverty level.) The open enrollment period for children below 200% of the poverty level and forchildren without access to health care coveragewill continue indefinitely. Children's Services Governor Sundquist considers the reform and consolidation of children's services as one of themost important accomplishments of hisadministration. Programs that had been scattered among six departments of state government werereorganized within a single new Department ofChildren's Services. The department's goals are: Provide appropriate care for children in custody close to home and return them totheir families or provide for permanencyof care in a timely manner Provide community prevention and intervention services to keep our childrenand communities safe Increase community involvement, local decision-making and accountability forfunding and services Create an effective management and delivery system to ensure services areprovided in a timely and cost effectivemanner. Improvement of Health and Behavioral Health Services \u2014 The Department of Children's Services wants all children in custody to havetimely medical and dental screenings andappropriate medical treatment; this EPSDT(Early, Periodic, Screening, Diagnosis &Treatment) is part of the medical interventiongiven to all children entering custody. EPSDTscreenings are the \"gateway\" to preventive careand referrals for appropriate care and treatment.In each of the 12 regions, the department addeda Health Unit comprised of a Children'sServices TennCare representative, a nursepractitioner or nurse, and a part-timepsychologist. Review of Foster Care and Adoption Programs \u2014 The Department of Children's Services worked closely with the Child WelfareLeague of America (CWLA) in an extensiveproject to review the Tennessee Foster Care andAdoption Programs. CWLA helped thedepartment to assess the current status of thefoster care and adoption programs and todevelop strategies for change based upon thereview. Based on recommendations by theCWLA, the General Assembly passed, and the Governor signed, legislation to improve servicesto children in foster care. CWLA has developeda three-year plan to help the departmentimplement the results of the review. Theproposed budget includes additional funds forthe third step of this plan. The funds willfurther reduce foster care caseloads, meetincreases in demand for adoption assistance,enhance permanent custodial placement, andimprove management of children in statecustody. Increased Focus on Adoption \u2014 Critical to the department's mission, and a major goal, is thetimeliness of achieving a child's permanencythrough adoption. The department has a strongmandate to move children to permanency morequickly, whether that is return of the child to hisor her natural home or to an adoptive placement.In order to improve the current adoption system,the department is working closely withproviders, the courts, and child advocates toexpand recruitment of adoptive homes and toremove legal and administrative barriers thathave hampered adoptive placements. Thisstrategy will help to increase the number ofadoptive placements and to shorten the timechildren are in state custody. Between FY1998-1999 and FY 1999-2000 the number offinalized adoptions completed increased from394 to 483. More Concentration on Independent Living \u2014 The department provides independent livingservices to all foster care youth, ages 16 andabove. These services are designed to give youththe necessary skills to become productivecitizens. Youth are taught skills to assist themin employment, decision-making, problemsolving, housing, transportation, education,literacy, and knowledge of communityresources. Budget initiatives have providedadditional funds to improve independent livingservices. Improving Child Abuse Prevention and Detection \u2014 All newly employed Child Protective Services staff and selected lawenforcement Child Protective Investigative Team members have received training inadvanced investigation techniques. Thedepartment has strengthened its ability to assistlocal efforts through the stationing of ChildProtective Services staff in Child AdvocacyCenters in Sullivan, Hamilton, Montgomery,Knox, Davidson, Robertson, Lawrence,Madison, Tipton, Henderson, and Shelbycounties. The department has worked with theGeneral Assembly to pass legislationestablishing seven forensic child interviewerpositions located in Child Advocacy Centers ineach grand division of the state. The proposedbudget includes funds to develop a centralizedintake system for receiving and responding tochild abuse reports. Implementing the Non-Custodial Network Pilot Project \u2014 One goal of the Department of Children's Services is to \"provide communityprevention and intervention services to keep ourchildren and communities safe.\" To achievethis goal, DCS (FSS) network. Thecommunity-based FSS network provides thenecessary services to families and children toprevent or solve problems that would ultimatelyresult in the child being placed in the custody ofthe state. The FSS network allows clients accessto a full continuum of services without goingfrom agency to agency. The Family SupportServices network will be expanded statewide inFY 2001-2002. Continuing the Successful Family Crisis Intervention Program (FCIP) \u2014 The Family Crisis Intervention Program (FCIP) servesunruly children who have committed an offensethat would not be illegal for an adult; this childcould be a truant, a runaway, or be beyond thecontrol of the parent. By law, if the departmentis unsuccessful in helping the family resolvetheir issues with the child, this new programmay certify to the court that further interventionis warranted, including, but not limited to, commitment to state custody. The FCIP programrelies on crisis intervention techniques to helpfamilies resolve their issues with the child.Services are short term, typically 30 days orless. For the past two fiscal years, FCIP had astatewide success rate of 94% in preventing thebreakup of families and the placement ofchildren into state custody. TNKIDS Information Management System \u2014 Tennessee is implementing a new child welfareinformation management system calledTNKIDS. This system will, for the first timeprovide front line case managers, supervisorsand management with the information and toolsto retrieve data and information essential totracking, managing, and planning services for allchildren under our care. In order to assure theavailability of information needed by staff,TNKIDS has been developed with extensiveinput and involvement of all levels ofdepartmental staff. Eligibility determination,contracts, and fiscal modules are beingdeveloped and added to the system. Outcome-Based Contracting \u2014 The Department of Children's Services hasimproved contracting with service providers byfocusing on desired outcomes. All agenciesunder contract with the department now haveoutcome measures for tracking success,services, and the matching of contract agencyactivities with the goals of the Department ofChildren's Services. By reporting and trackingoutcome expectations, providers and thedepartment can evaluate programs, impact ofservices, and coordinate needs and goals. Juvenile Facilities \u2014 A violent offender program is being implemented at Taft YouthDevelopment Center. The proposed budgetincludes increased dorm security, maintenanceand educational positions at Wilder YouthDevelopment Center.Excellence in Education K-12 Education Reading is imperative to the success and future of Tennessee's children. Our state'sfuture depends on their success. This budgetmoves beyond maintenance of full funding ofthe Basic Education Program (BEP) formula, torecommend funding of a Reading Initiative.Better reading skills will have impact in thesuccess of our children in every school subject.This initiative is explained below, followingsome initial information about the BEP. Tennessee has come a long way toward improving its education system. In 1992, thestate made a significant commitment to improveK-12 public education. In Fiscal Year 1997-98,the State of Tennessee met its commitment toreach full funding on schedule during the sixthyear of the Basic Education Program, the state'sfunding mechanism for K-12 public education.More than a billion dollars in new state fundshave been provided since 1991-92. The BEP is part of the 1992 Education Improvement Act (EIA), which has radicallychanged the way elementary and secondaryeducation is funded, has raised academicstandards, reduced class sizes, and made localschool systems more accountable for results.For the first time, this act provided for aseparate state fund for education revenues, theEducation Trust Fund. The legislature alsoenacted a one-half cent sales tax increase inApril of 1992, the proceeds of which areearmarked solely for education. Reading Initiative \u2014 Recognizing the need to build on the educational success of Tennessee'schildren and ensure that every child has anopportunity to succeed in school, the Governorhas proposed the Reading Initiative. There aresix components of the Reading Initiative:Reading Coaches; Early Childhood Education;Catching Up; Teaching Resources - QualityTeaching; Teaching Resources - DigitalEnhancement; Teaching Resources - ClassroomMaterials. The Administration has developed a five-year plan for this initiative and is proposingfirst-year funding of $96.7 million. The Reading Coaches component will provide training programs for teachers andstudents. The training programs will makereading by the end of the third grade a priorityand build on those skills. This goal can beaccomplished by having a trained reading coachin every K-8 school. This coach will receiveintensive reading training from a partnershipbetween the Department of Education andhigher education institutions. The trainingrelationship will be maintained andcontinuously enhanced through the state'sinternet infrastructure. The coach will providethis training to every teacher in the school.Also, the coach will work to train volunteers toassist in accomplishing the department's goals.By making reading a priority, students can buildon and expand those skills in other subjectsduring their K-12 education. To help ensure that more Tennessee children arrive at school ready to learn at a pacewith their peers, the Governor has proposed tofund an Early Childhood Education program forfour-year-olds not currently served by HeadStart or other preschool programs. Thisprogram, along with the Reading Coaches, is anessential element for school success. Four-year-old children will attain the cognitive, social,emotional, and physical development skillsneeded to begin school. The program will beimplemented in phases, with educationally at-risk children enrolled in phase one. There arecurrently 36,850 four-year-olds not served by apre-school program. Phase one of this initiativewill serve 7,370. The goal of theAdministration is to provide early childhoodeducation to all four-year-olds by the 2005-2006school year. The Early Childhood EducationInitiative will provide youngsters theopportunity to develop the building blocksneeded for successful learning.The Catching Up component of the Reading Initiative is targeted toward helpingmiddle school students lay the groundworkneeded to pass the Gateway tests that arerequired for high school graduation. Studentachievement on the current high schoolcompetency test and on the seventh and eighthgrade Tennessee Comprehensive AssessmentProgram (TCAP) tests indicates that asubstantial number of students are at risk offailing the much more difficult Gateway tests setto begin in the 2001-2002 school year. Studentswith the greatest risk of failure will receivespecial attention to help them develop the skillsthey need to pass the graduation tests. The Teaching Quality component will provide scholarships for specific subject areaswhere a teacher shortage exists. This initiativealso includes a mentoring program to help trainnew teachers, a program to encourage teachersto obtain national certification, a professionaldevelopment partnership between local schoolsand higher education institutions that willpromote the professional development of bothprospective and existing K-12 teachers, and anelectronic service to match teachers with schoolsystems where they are needed. Thiscomponent of the Reading Initiative alsoincludes funding for the Teaching as a SecondCareer program, which is designed to encourageprofessionals to earn teaching certificates intheir fields. The Digital Enhancement component of the Reading Initiative will provide AdvancedPlacement courses through the internet in schoolsystems unable to offer the courses at particularschools due to lack of teachers or small numbersof students. This will narrow the gap ofacademic opportunities between large and smallschool systems. This initiative also calls for theexpansion and improvement of the internetinfrastructure currently in the schools and tofund the expansion of the internet pipeline asthe requirements of schools increase. The Classroom Materials component of the Reading Initiative will provide an additional$100 per teacher - which will double theamount they now have - for classroommaterials. Current educational research indicates that providing teachers the resourcesthey need to teach is one of the best and mostcost effective ways to improve studentachievement. Other K-12 Improvements \u2014 In addition to the Reading Initiative, funding is included in thebudget for the English as a Second Languageprogram and for the start-up cost for an autismcenter in East Tennessee. With the funding and implementation of these initiatives, as well as additional funds tocontinue full funding of the BEP, the Gatewaytests, and other education programs,Tennessee's K-12 students will have thefoundation they need to succeed academically. The Basic Education Program \u2014 The funding formula established by the EIA is called theBasic Education Program. The BEP providesfunds to local school systems based on theirstudent membership and costs of certaineducational components shared with thecommunity's relative ability to fund education.Educational components are broken down intotwo categories: classroom and non-classroom.Classroom components include items such asteachers, instructional equipment, supplies andmaterials, and textbooks. Non-classroomcomponents include such items astransportation, superintendents, construction,and maintenance and operations. Classroomcomponents are funded 75% by the state andnon-classroom components are funded 50% bythe state. Since 1991-92, $1.2 billion in new recurring funding will have been invested in theBEP as of 2001-2002. In addition, the state hasprovided $12.3 million in recurring funding forteacher salary equalization. According to theDepartment of Education's 1999-2000 21stCentury Report between average per studentgrew from $3,732 to $5,794 (see chart below),an increase of 55%. This growth is even moreimpressive when coupled with the fact thatstudent enrollment in Tennessee's schools has grown by 8.1% in that same time period. Making Diplomas Count \u2014 The Tennessee General Assembly and State Board of Educationhave approved an Administration proposal toraise the standards students must meet tograduate with a high school diploma. Beginningwith freshmen entering high school in 2001-2002, the Tennessee Competency Test, whichmeasures 8th grade achievement in languagearts and mathematics, will be replaced by highschool Gateway tests in Algebra I, English IIand Biology, which every student must pass tograduate. Additional funds to develop and field-test five more end-of-course tests are included inthe K-12 budget. These are Algebra II,Geometry, Physical Science, Chemistry, andAmerican History. This will completedevelopment and field testing of all ten requiredend-of-course tests. ConnecTEN \u2014 Initiated in 1995-96, ConnecTEN made Tennessee the first state inthe nation to connect all of its public schoolsand libraries to the museums, libraries anddatabases available on the World Wide Web.The state is now making internet resourcesavailable to every public school classroom.Tennessee has nearly 900,000 students on aconsolidated, standardized, and reliable networkwith approximately 150,000 computers online.The network currently is undergoing significantimprovements that include more bandwidth,better equipment, more robust e-mail andservers, and filtering of material inappropriatefor K-12 students. Just as we made a commitment to improve our K-12 program in 1992, we must also addressthe needs of our higher education system. It is essential that we maintain all the parts of oureducation system to make Tennessee a leader inthe 21st Century. Higher Education Tennessee must work harder to improve itshigher education system. We are competingagainst other states in the southeast and thenation that have recognized the importance of aquality higher education system. In regional andnational comparisons, our colleges anduniversities do not rank among the top tierschools. The quality of the faculty and thefacilities must be raised to higher levels, and acommitment must be made to increasingeducational attainment of the citizens ofTennessee. The state must work harder to encourage more people to earn a post-secondary degree.Only 16.9% of Tennesseans over the age of 25have a college degree, compared with thenational average of 24.4%. Our figure is lessthan all of our neighboring states exceptArkansas (16.2%). A college education isimportant to the individual, as well as to society,because of the difference in income realizedthrough education. According to 1998 Censusdata, a person with a bachelor's degree has anaverage annual income of $40,695 comparedwith $24,916 for a person with only a highschool diploma. The difference in income willresult in financial benefits to society throughincreased spending in the economy and throughincreased revenues to the state. Additionally, abetter educated workforce will help in recruitingindustry as companies require highly skilledworkers who can be used in today's high-techeconomy. In short, spending on highereducation can be viewed as an investment withsolid returns to the individual, the businesscommunity, and the state. Our higher education system must be improved to allow Tennessee to hold onto itsbest and brightest students. According to the1999 report of the Governor's Council onExcellence in Higher Education, hasOperating Expenditures per Student 01234567 1991-1992 1998-1999 1999-2000Fiscal YearThousands$3,732$5,485$5,794few high SAT scorers who apply to in-state universities. That report raised concerns thatTennessee's brightest students do not see thehigher education opportunity in our state thatthey desire. Were it not for our private collegesand universities, Tennessee would be a netexporter of college-bound students. We must provide more funding for our colleges and universities to attract qualityfaculty. The Southeastern Regional EducationalBoard (SREB) has reported that expendituresfor public higher education in Tennessee as apercentage of state and local governmentspending declined from 31.2% in 1986 to 30.8%in 1996. In addition, the SREB has reported thatinflation adjusted state expenditures per fulltime equivalent student have decreased 24.4%since 1987. (For more detail on highereducation attainment and comparisons, see pageB-88 of this Budget Document.) The decline in funding for Higher Education has made it more difficult to maintaina high standard for both the faculty and physicalfacilities at our state universities. As charged inthe Governor's Council report and confirmedthrough system-level tracking, many of ourfaculty are leaving Tennessee for higher payingjobs at universities in other states. Increasedfunding is also needed to maintain the physicalfacilities of our campuses. Better classrooms,libraries, equipment, laboratories, and otherfacilities will help us to attract the best studentsand faculty. In its 1999 report, the Governor's Council on Excellence in Higher Education presented ablueprint for making Tennessee's public highereducation system among the nation's very best.The report included five broadrecommendations to improve the state's highereducation system: Define and adopt a modern system-wide mission Establish goals and performance targets in keeping with the mission Authorize the Tennessee Higher EducationCommission to ensure that programs, institutions, and operating components arealigned with the goals Strategically increase funding and link allocated revenues to performance goals Enhance governing authority and reorganize the governing board appointment process. In addition to these observations, the Council challenged the state of Tennessee tobegin making the investment in higher educationand its future. Fiscal deficiencies were shownin the areas of per student appropriations,faculty salaries, student financial aid, andresearch funding. This budget includes fundingfor improvements that begins to address thebasic problems in our higher education systemand to implement many of the recommendationsof the Council. Higher Education Excellence Initiatives \u2014 Along with the Tennessee Higher Education Commission, the University of Tennessee, andthe State Board of Regents, this budget has beendeveloped to continue the Council onExcellence in Higher Education's five-year planto add $445 million for improvements toTennessee's system of higher education. Funding of $92.4 million is included in this budget for the second year of the HigherEducation Excellence Initiatives. This includesfunding of $10 million from state appropriationsto help make Tennessee's public collegesbecome more competitive in the hiring andretention of faculty in high demand disciplines.Funding for this initiative will be matched with$5 million from student tuition and fees, inorder to make a total of $15 million available forthis purpose. This will allow Tennessee'spublic colleges to compete for exceptionalfaculty now teaching in other states. Theinitiatives also call for providing operatingincreases for each of our public colleges. Thesefunds will be used to improve library holdings,improve instructional and laboratory budgets,support technology initiatives, improve campus equipment and building maintenance, increasegraduate student stipends, and address inflationof basic fixed operating costs. Another important part of the initiatives is to provide special instructional and researchequipment. Funding is included in the budget topurchase special equipment in both theUniversity of Tennessee and Board of Regentssystems. One of the objectives of the Excellence Initiatives is to make the University ofTennessee one of the top 25 public researchuniversities by 2008 and to enhance researchinitiatives at other major institutions. Thebudget includes the second $7.5 millioninstallment of a $30 million appropriation goalto enable UT to double federal research and development grants. Also, research funding isincluded for the research institutions in theBoard of Regents system. With the additionalfunds these institutions will be able to developmajor research activities and attract federalgrants that will help to elevate the researchfunction. The Governor's Council on Excellence in Higher Education also recommended fundingfor additional student financial aid. The budgetincludes improvement funding of $9 million forthe second straight year for the TennesseeStudent Assistance Corporation to providetuition assistance to an additional 6,021 needystudents and to raise maximum studentassistance award levels. Economic Opportunity Economic Development More than ever before, leading companies from around the world are discovering theadvantages of doing business in Tennessee.With our prime geographic location, skilledworkforce, outstanding transportation networkand pro-business environment, Tennessee hasearned a solid reputation as a premier businesslocation. From the automotive industry to telecommunications, to printing and publishing,to warehousing and distribution, our diversebusiness base speaks volumes as to the wealthof economic and lifestyle advantages andopportunities that, quite simply, help companiesbuild better products more efficiently inTennessee. Tennessee's bright business climate, along with quality of life and cultural diversity, offerscompanies more options than ever. Year afteryear, our state breaks records for capitalinvestment and job creation, which is whymulti-national companies continue to chooseTennessee communities time and time again fornew and expanded operations. In short, Tennessee is the right match forbusinesses looking for a consistent, predictable and aggressively pro-businessclimate where they can grow and beprofitable. In 2000, Tennessee had its best year yet for announced private capital investmentwith $7 billion in announced capitalinvestment by new and existing industries,and the potential creation of more than34,000 new jobs. Record capital investments have marked the Sundquist Administration. In six years,a total of $31 billion has been committedby new and existing industry. Over the period from 1994-1999, per capita income in Tennessee rose 23.6%.The state has made great strides in recentyears, rising from $178 below thesoutheast region in average per capitaincome to $129 below. Over the past 10years, Tennessee has climbed from 85.9%of the nation's average to 89.6%. More Tennesseans are working now thanat any time in history. Tennessee's unemployment rate has fallen below 6%for the last seven years. Since 1995, ourstate has seen a net gain of 144,700 jobs. Tennessee is ranked among the top ten states in the nation for number of jobslinked to foreign investment and rankedeleventh in the nation in manufacturingjobs. State Government is committed to enhancing community quality of life andincreasing Tennessee family income. TheAdministration places great importance onworkforce development initiatives, includingimproved training programs, coordinated jobplacement efforts and adult basic education.The Administration also places particularemphasis on beneficial partnerships with theprivate sector to stimulate continued economicopportunity in communities statewide. The Tennessee Department of Economic & Community Development \u2014 The philosophy of the Department of Economic and CommunityDevelopment is to invest in Tennessee's greatestresources: our communities and our peoplethrough assistance in community basedinfrastructure and training investments. Tennessee Business Services \u2014 Tennessee Business Services (TBS) provides the assistancecommunities and employers need to attract,maintain, and increase jobs in Tennessee. TBSworks with a network of organizations statewideto help assure the success of existing businessand to encourage their expansion. Businessdevelopment activities include: A statewide manufacturing resource network to help manufacturers solveproblems and become more competitivethrough the Manufacturing Means Jobsinitiative Offering engineering, technical and training assistance to manufacturersthrough the Tennessee Manufacturing Extension Partnership Small Business Services works to assure the success of small businesses statewidethrough its small business informationguide and assistance programs The department has recently partnered with the Tennessee Small BusinessDevelopment Center network to provideentrepreneurs and small business ownerswith easily accessible counselors in 14center locations statewide to assist them instarting and growing their smallbusinesses The Office of Minority Business Enterprise facilitates the resources neededin assisting minority businesses in growthand business development. Marketing & Recruiting \u2014 Enhancing Tennessee's image as a premier businesslocation is the primary focus of the marketingteam. International business promotion andrecruitment are emphasized, as well as strategicconferencing and testimonial advertising innational publications. Additional activitiesinclude: Providing prospects with a general or prospect-specific packet with informationon taxes, transportation systems, laborstatistics and environmental regulations Recommending available facilities or industrial sites to prospects Governor-led business recruitment missions to key international regions Tennessee's nationally-ranked Industrial Training Service (ITS) assists withrecruitment, screening and training of newemployees, and provides job-specifictraining and overall workforcedevelopment Tennessee Job Skills, a workforce incentive grant program, is designed toassist industries in elevating the skills oftheir existing workers and keep themcompetitive The Tennessee Industrial Infrastructure Program (TIIP) works with communitiesand regions to provide industrialinfrastructure support on issues like water,sewer and rail sidings. TIIP serves as anincentive in the process of encouragingprivate sector firms to locate or expandtheir financial investments in Tennessee In 1999, for every TIIP dollar invested by the State of Tennessee, $107 was investedby the private sector. Community Development \u2014 Community Development works with Tennesseecommunities to prepare and compete foreconomic development and improve communityquality of life. The Governor's Three-Star Program was created to help communities take fulladvantage of economic developmentopportunities, preserve existingemployment, create new jobs and increasefamily income. The Energy Division promotes economic growth by helping businesses andgovernment organizations improve energyefficiency. The Local Planning Assistance program provides technical assistance to help localgovernments strengthen their planning andcommunity development efforts. Tourist Development \u2014 The travel and tourism industry is an important factor in Tennessee'seconomy. Domestic and international travelersto Tennessee annually spend nearly $9.2billion. As a result of spending by travelers,tourism provides jobs for over 172,200Tennesseans, and tax revenues for state and local governments totaling over $779.2 million.Almost 38.7 million people visited Tennessee in1999, making Tennessee one of the nation'smost popular destinations. Because of the jobs and tax revenues produced by tourism, national and regionalcompetition for tourism continues to be high. Inorder to increase its share of tourist dollars,Tennessee must aggressively market andpromote the state's assets. Some of theDepartment of Tourist Development's marketingprograms include national broadcast and printadvertising campaigns, and direct salesprograms targeted at group tour companies,travel agents, and international tour operators.In addition, the department makes co-opadvertising projects available to the tourismindustry, develops rural and heritage tourismopportunities through promotion programs,promotes Tennessee to the media and nationaltravel press, and develops Tennesseepublications which are distributed to customers.The department also operates the state's thirteenwelcome centers, which provide literature,information and reservations to the millions oftravelers who visit Tennessee. Families First Effective September 1, 1996, Families First replaced the former Aid to Families withDependent Children (AFDC) program inTennessee. The new program emphasizespersonal responsibility, work requirements, timelimits for assistance, and education and jobtraining. Families First also provides itsparticipants child care, transportation, increasedcoordination with child support enforcement,and transitional benefits. Personal Responsibility \u2014 The foundation of Families First rests on the individualizedPersonal Responsibility Plan. This plan,developed between the participant and the casemanager, outlines the steps towards self-reliance: Failures to participate in work activities and reach the goals specified in the plancan reduce or eliminate benefits Teen parents must stay in school and live at home with parents or anotherresponsible adult Parents must ensure all eligible children attend school, infants and youth must beimmunized and children's health checksmust be current. Work Requirements \u2014 Work builds self-esteem and independence from welfare assistance.While working, participants will also gainexperience for greater responsibilities and careeradvancement: Non-exempt participants will be required to work and/or engage in work-relatedtraining or education 40 hours a week Those who are unable to find a job must engage in community service or jobreadiness classes. Education and Job Training \u2014 While many Families First participants currently have somecombination of education and work experience,many need job training classes to enhance theiremployability: Participants must be engaged 40 hours a week in a combination of education, job-related training, and work Participants testing below a 9th grade functional literacy level can enroll in 20hours a week of adult basic education andare exempted from additional work andtime limits until they reach the 9th gradelevel Participants may be required to attend life skills classes (e.g., parenting skills,budgeting, self-esteem). Support Services \u2014 Certain support services are provided to those individuals who work orparticipate in education, employment training,counseling, or treatment services. These services include: Transportation (including a First Wheels Vehicle interest free loan for qualifiedindividuals) Child Care Dental and Optical Assistance Uniforms and other clothes needed for work or training Other supportive services necessary for work or training. Time Limited Benefits \u2014 Limits on benefits have been established as a means ofencouraging participants to work efficientlytowards employment. Benefits for non-exempt participants are limited to 18 months at any one time andto five years over the course of a lifetime Exemptions to this requirement include disabled caregivers, caregivers ages 60and over, caregivers assisting disabledfamily members, families who do not havean adult included in the grant amount, andindividuals functioning under 9th gradelevel who attend basic education classes. Family Services Counseling \u2014 Individuals who are having difficulty participating in FamiliesFirst or who request help with personalproblems qualify for family services counselingassessments and counseling services while oncash assistance and for 12 months after leavingthe program. These services cover: Mental Health issues Drug and alcohol problems Learning disabilities Domestic violence issues Children's health and behavior issues Transitional Benefits \u2014 In order for families to sustain self-sufficiency, many benefits will beextended beyond the period of cash assistance.Availability of these benefits can be up to 18 months after full employment begins and caninclude: Child care Transitional Medicaid Food Stamps Family Services counseling First Wheels vehicle loans Child Support Enforcement \u2014 Many of the families enrolled in Families First would notneed assistance if child support payments weremade. Families First expects participants to: Identify the father of dependent children Help find the absent parent and establish paternity. In addition to these efforts, Tennessee has also passed the license revocation law,implemented the Tennessee Child SupportEnforcement Computer System (TCSES), andutilized the internet in location of delinquentparents. Child Care \u2014 Based on the recommendations of the 1996 Governor's Task Force on ChildCare, the Department of Human Services'initiatives in child care will continue to focus onthree central issues: quality, affordability, andavailability. Revisions to child care center and home- licensing standards will improve adult-to-child ratios and increase trainingrequirements Child Care Resource Centers will help providers better meet the needs of childrenwith disabilities, educate parents, andserve as a resource to providers andparents regarding appropriate develop-mental programs and practices A comprehensive statewide communityand consumer education campaign will enhance community understanding of theelements of quality care (such as training,adult/child ratios, curriculum) Expansion of training provided through the Tennessee Early Childhood TrainingAlliance (TECTA), a statewide service ofBoard of Regents institutions that supportsand enhances the quality of earlychildhood education personnel, willcontinue with the addition of a Mid-Cumberland site The basis for income eligibility for child care services will be raised, and the levelof reimbursement rates to providersincreased. Program Outcomes \u2014 The average monthly welfare case load for FY 1999-2000 was 57,153families, down by 32,494 cases (from 91,499 inAugust, 1996, to 59,005 in November, 2000).The June 1999 caseload reflected the followingactivities: Employed 14.9% Adult Education 7.7% Work preparation/ Job skill training 29.5% Exempt caretaker 19.7% Child only care 30.0% Family Service Counseling 3.4% Families First is also conducting several demonstration projects focusing on non-custodial fathers, savings accounts, and drugaddicted mothers. These programs reinforce theefforts made by Families First to develophealthier family relationships and decreasedependence on government assistance. While some families will continue to experience personal and financial setbacks which requireassistance, Families First helps ensure that theirneed is temporary and that families quicklyreturn to stability and self-reliance.Public Health TennCare Containing Health Care Costs Through Managed Care Organizations \u2014 TennCare is a program that provides health care coverage toalmost one-fourth of the citizens of the state, or1,380,000 people. It is operated under a federalSection 1115a waiver, which permits the state toenroll uninsured and uninsurable people in theprogram as well as persons who are qualified toreceive services through Medicaid. Programbeneficiaries receive the vast majority of theirhealth care through managed care organizationsunder contract with the state. There are someservices\u2014such as long-term care and Medicarecost-sharing\u2014that are provided by the stateoutside the managed care structure. About 800,000 enrollees are eligible for TennCare because they are eligible forMedicaid. Another 580,000 are eligible becausethey are uninsured or uninsurable. \"Uninsured\"means they do not have access to healthinsurance where they work, and \"uninsurable\"means they cannot buy health insurance becauseof a medical problem that they have. Mostuninsured and uninsurable beneficiaries haveincomes below the federal poverty level, butthose with higher incomes contribute to the costof their care on a sliding scale. TennCare is a $5.6 billion program. Nearly two-thirds of this cost, or 64.71%, is federallyfunded. The remaining 35.29% is theresponsibility of the state. Tennessee has beenresourceful in coming up with its share of totalprogram dollars including the use of drugrebates, premium payments by enrollees, andprogram related taxes. Only 32.64% of thedollars spent in the TennCare program actuallycomes from the state's General Fund. In otherwords, Tennessee is paying only about 33 centsout of its treasury for each $1.00 worth of healthcare it is buying for its neediest and sickestcitizens. These dollars go to purchase care fromproviders who, in the case of uninsured anduninsurable enrollees, would likely be providingthis care with little or no compensation if the TennCare program did not exist. Not all of the $5.6 billion TennCare budget goes to the managed care plans. Only $3.5billion is earmarked for managed care; thisamount is financed by pooling current federal,state, and local expenditures for indigent healthcare. The remainder of the budget is spent onlong-term care, services provided by theDepartment of Children's Services for childrenin custody or at risk of custody, Home andCommunity Based Waiver programs for personswho would otherwise require institutional care,Medicare cost-sharing for low-income Medicarebeneficiaries, and program administration. It is important to recognize the savings that TennCare has generated for the state. Over theeight years since the program began, TennCarehas saved an average of $312.5 million annuallyin state funds. This figure is calculated bycomparing projected Medicaid expenditureswithout TennCare to actual and estimatedTennCare expenditures for the period from FY1993-1994 to FY 200-2001, using the averageannual increase for Medicaid programsadministered by other states in the SouthernLegislative Conference and trending forward theestimated savings of state funds that were usedto maximize federal funding for TennCare. Even more impressive than the financial savings generated by the program are theimprovements in health outcomes that haveoccurred. As one of the highest priorityinitiatives of state government, TennCare hasdemonstrated an ability to bring about steadyimprovements in key health care outcomes:decrease in percentage of uninsuredTennesseans, decrease in infant mortality rates,increase in childhood immunization rates,increase in mammography rates, decrease ininappropriate use of the hospital emergencyroom, and decrease in hospitalizations forchildren with asthma. TennCare has created anenvironment whereby more services are beingdelivered in less expensive and moreappropriate outpatient settings, rather than costly hospital settings. During the current fiscal year (2000-2001), TennCare has developed a new business model,which is focusing on smaller, regionalizedmanaged care organizations (MCOs) andincreased accountability. Last year theGeneral Assembly made sure that the program isactuarially funded for the current year, andwithin that funding structure TennCare hasdeveloped a new risk-sharing model to offer toMCOs. In addition, administrativeimprovements and new performance measuresare being developed and implemented to assurethat the program achieves the desired results. One strategy that is being pursued aggressively during the current year is to attractnew MCOs to the program. New MCOs mustbe well-capitalized and experienced insurancecompanies. It is anticipated that these newcompanies will replace companies that areleaving the program and offer additional choiceto enrollees in remaining plans. Included in the budget is funding for rate increases for health care providers. These rateincreases include a four percent capitation rateincrease for Managed Care Organizations, aneight percent increase for Behavioral HealthOrganizations, an increase for pharmacyinflation, and payments to Federally QualifiedHealth Clinics participating in the TennCareprogram. The budget also includes funds forincreased enrollment. Additional funding is also recommended for the expansion of the long-term carealternative for the Medicaid population. Thisfunding will provide home and communitybased services for an additional 1,200 Medicaid-eligible clients. Funding is also included in therecommended budget to expand long-term carefor the elderly and disabled. These fundsinclude a three percent rate increase and anenrollment increase for the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE);increased funding for Levels I and II nursinghome facilities; and a five percent increase forthe Senior/Adapt program, which serves theelderly and disabled.The budget also includes funding to improve TennCare administration and oversight.Positions and funding will be added to improvemember services and appeals, informationsystems, managed care oversight, providerrelations, long-term care waiver administration,and legal services. TennCare Partners \u2014 In July 1996, mental health services were merged into a managedcare system called TennCare Partners. This newsystem utilizes two behavioral healthorganizations (BHOs) to manage mental healthservices similar to the TennCare MCOs. Theyserve all enrollees of the TennCare Program andthe Department of Mental Health and MentalRetardation's priority population. Theseservices include: Psychiatric and substance abuse inpatient treatment Outpatient mental health and substance abuse treatment Psychiatric pharmacy services Transportation to covered mental health services Other specialized mental health treatment such as case management and crisisservices. Department of Health \u2014 Public health officials have recently recognized the need to be moreaggressive in locating and treating cases oftuberculosis. The budget includes funding toidentify and treat latent cases of tuberculosis inorder to prevent an outbreak of activetuberculosis. Local health departments haveonly enough resources to treat persons withactive tuberculosis. The funding included in thebudget will provide for the testing of anadditional 42,000 people per year.Approximately 40% of the people tested willtest positive for tuberculosis. Local healthofficials will provide treatment and drug therapy to the people who test positive. This processwill allow health officials to contain anyoutbreaks of tuberculosis. The department will also be working to comply with federal nursing home inspectionstandards. Funding is included in the budget torequire unlicensed health facilities to ceaseoperations until they become licensed. Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities \u2014 The Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities iscurrently working on a major initiative, calledthe Creating Homes Initiative. Through thisinitiative the department will work to createsafe, affordable, appropriate, and qualityhousing for Tennesseans with mental illness.This initiative is built on partnership with keyTennessee community leaders representingconsumer, family member, mental health,community social service provider, landlord,realtor, faith-based, nonprofit, bank,government, foundation, mental health, andhousing agency sectors. Specifically thislandmark initiative proposes to do the followingin partnership with the previously mentionedkey leaders: Create 2005 new and improved permanent housing options for Tennesseans withmental illness by 2005. Aggressively and strategically seek out and collaborate with potential untapped fundingentities to leverage state dollars and funnelhousing funds to local communities. Achieve greater parity in the availability of safe, affordable, and appropriate housing forpeople with mental illness as compared to the population at large. Reduce the recidivism rate of persons in our criminal justice system diagnosed with amental illness who are there due to the lackof community housing and support systems. Reduce the rate of unnecessary hospital stays in hospital beds in regional mentalhealth institutes that are directly attributableto inadequate, available housing. Through this initiative, the Department's Office of Housing Planning and Development has beeninstrumental in generating and securing over $7million of additional funding for housingoptions for persons with mental illness,including the creation of approximately 500 newhousing options for persons with mental illnessin Tennessee. Commission on Aging \u2014 The Commission on Aging will be participating in a new federalprogram to enhance the home and communitybased services system for elderly and disabledpersons who do not qualify for services underMedicaid. This program will increase theservices available to the elderly and disabledwith the objective of preventing or delayingadditional persons from entering a nursinghome. Funding is included in the budget tomatch the federal grant that supports thisprogram. The funds will be used for a familycaregiver support services program that willprovide information and referral, respiteservices, personal care, and other home andcommunity based services to families andindividuals caring for aging or disabled persons Public Safety Crime Legislation \u2014 To address the growing crime problems, the Sundquist Administrationand the Legislature created a long-termlegislative package to address some of thecrucial concerns of Tennesseans regarding theincrease of crime in our neighborhoods. The first year of the crime package saw legislationranging from capital punishment to drug testingto \"Three Strikes, You're Out.\" A total ofnineteen bills were enacted under the crimepackage umbrella with a price tag of $16 million during the 1995 Legislative Session. Passage ofthe crime package resulted in the creation of thestate-funded Post-Conviction DefenderCommission. The Office of the Post-ConvictionDefender was created to oversee the appellatetrials of indigent persons convicted with a deathsentence. Legislation also required deathpenalty appeals to receive priority before thecourts to expedite and shorten the state appellateprocess to five years. Three Strikes \u2014 During the first year of the crime package, the length of time felons werespending in prison was foremost in the publiceye. Tennessee responded by passing the\"Three Strikes, You're Out\" law. This lawrequires two-time felons to serve their fullsentence upon conviction of a third felonycharge. Other felony sentences were alsolengthened and restrictions placed on minimumsentences for certain Class A felonies. Juvenile Justice Reform \u2014 In December 1997, Governor Sundquist appointed a commission toreview and recommend changes to current statelaws for juvenile offenders. The JuvenileJustice Reform Commission issued its report inDecember 1999. The report recommendedchanges to the juvenile code. TheCommission's report contained three majorrecommendations: Violent juvenile offenders age 15 and over should be treated as adults, andautomatically transferred to adult criminalcourt and, if convicted, sentenced to theDepartment of Corrections. A blended sentencing option should be available for juvenile court judges andcriminal court judges to provide for moreflexible sentencing as well asopportunities for rehabilitation througheducational, vocational, and othertreatment programs. Violent juvenileoffenders should be ineligible for blendedsentencing. Juveniles sentenced underblended sentencing should be housed in anappropriate institution, separate from adult inmates. Local Truancy Review Boards currently are mandated in those areas of the statethat do not already have an effectivetruancy prevention program. Truancycases should be diverted from the localjuvenile courts to the Truancy ReviewBoards for disposition in order to allowthe juvenile court judges to concentrate onmore serious crimes. The Commission also recommended that additional secure facilities be made available forthe growing female offender population, andthat both a central information system foradjudicated juveniles and an observation andassessment center be created. This budgetincludes funds to implement juvenile justicereforms. Probation and Parole \u2014 In 1998, the Governor signed legislation to combine the Board ofParoles and the probation function of theDepartment of Correction, creating a new Boardof Probation and Parole. This will result in amore efficient and effective organization for thesupervision of felony offenders who are notincarcerated but are under the supervision of thestate. During Fiscal Year 1996-97, increased supervision fees and mandatory drug testingwere imposed on felons who are released onparole or sentenced to probation. The FY 2001-2002 budget includes funding for 56 additional field officer, management, andsupport positions. This will allow the Board toreduce probation and parole officer caseloadsfrom an average of 1:100 to 1:89. Thesepositions will be funded half by appropriationsfrom general fund tax revenues and half bysupervision fees. Funding from general fundtaxes also is included to reduce caseloads in thecommunity correction program and increasealcohol and drug treatment services. It is alsorecommended that funding be provided for thediversion of more non-violent felons into thecommunity correction program. This willpermit better management of the future growth of the prison population. New Prisons \u2014 Longer sentences and \"Three Strikes\" legislation necessitated thedevelopment of a From FY 1995-1996 through FY1999-2000, 1,108 beds were added to the stateprison system by double-celling of inmates and2,280 new beds were constructed. During thissame period, 1,324 beds designated assubstandard, temporary, or operationally costlywere closed. The system's capacity was furtherincreased by the addition of 2,016 contract beds. Capital funding has been provided for construction of a new 1,700 bed prison facility.Capital funding was also provided for a 240 bedmaximum security units at Riverbend MaximumSecurity Institution, a 150 bed minimumsecurity addition at West Tennessee StatePenitentiary, and a 300 bed geriatric unit at theDeBerry Special Needs Facility. TheDepartment of Correction also intends to furtherincrease system capacity through additionaldouble-celling of 767 inmates. Of the bedsbeing added for double-celling, 170 are alreadyfunded and 597 beds are recommended forfunding in FY 2001-2002. Prison population models continue to indicate a need for on-going planning andconstruction of additional prison capacity. Toanswer this need, additional prison beds will beplanned for future construction years. In thisbudget, funds are recommended for preplanningthe next new prison. Completion of theseplanned projects along with the construction ofa previously funded prison should provide a net increase of 5,334 beds in system capacity by2005. Substance Abuse \u2014 Although DUI laws in Tennessee are some of the toughest in thenation, resulting in 28,000 convictions annually,DUI enforcement remains a high priority.During the 1995 legislative session, vehicularhomicide as a result of DUI was moved from aClass C felony carrying a sentence range of 3-15years to a Class B felony sentence of 8-30 years,based on mitigating factors, multiple offenses,and prior record. Additionally, in the 2000legislative session penalties were increased forpersons who refuse to take a blood alcohol testwhen requested by a law enforcement officer. Vehicular homicide was further defined in 1996 with a new category for aggravatedvehicular homicide where repeat DUI offendersconvicted of vehicular homicide receive a ClassA felony. Laws were passed to confiscate DUIoffenders' vehicles at the time of a second DUIarrest. Also during 1996, sentences for habitualdrug offenders were also made tougher. In 1998, penalties were increased for persons who receive a fourth conviction ofdriving while impaired, for persons involved intraffic accidents who were intoxicated, and forpersons convicted of driving a motor vehiclewith an alcohol concentration greater than0.20%. Natural Resources The Environment Tennessee continues to be a leader in innovative approaches to protecting theenvironment and conserving natural resources inthe southeast. Water Supply \u2014 In 2000, the Administration worked with the Tennessee General Assemblyto pass the Inter-Basin Transfer Water Act. Thisact will protect Tennessee's water for future generations. The Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation(TDEC) has appointed a Water Supply PolicyPanel to study water supply policy issues andmake recommendations to the legislature, if thepanel's findings indicate the need to do so. Thepanel has already met and plans to make anyneeded recommendations to the General Assembly in January 2002. Water Quality \u2014 Tennessee continues to implement a thirteen-year strategy to improvewater quality in the state's most impactedstreams. The state's watershed approach towater quality management began in 1996 andcontinues, with the state providing the mostdetailed water quality information available todate. This approach enables betterunderstanding and protection of the state's waterresources. In addition to identifying problems, the State of Tennessee is solving them by using theregulatory programs where they are mosteffective, partnering with other agencies, andassisting communities with the development oftheir wastewater infrastructure. Tennesseeawarded over $31 million in 2000 to upgradeand improve wastewater facilities. In 2000, the Commissioner of TDEC assembled a Water Quality Forum to discusswater quality improvement. The participantsincluded state and federal technicians anduniversity researchers. As a result of thismeeting, Tennessee is devoting additional timeand resources to the protection of small streams. Drinking Water \u2014 In the year 2000, the State of Tennessee approved a number of majorinitiatives to further improve drinking waterquality for citizens of this state. The state'sWater Quality Control Board strengthenedfiltration requirements; passed additional rulesregulating disinfection byproducts, lead andcopper control; and approved plans to enhancethe public notification rules. The state also undertook initiatives to increase the continuing education requirementsfor persons certified to operate drinking watertreatment facilities. TDEC's Division ofCommunity Assistance dispensed approximately$12 million in loans to upgrade and improvedrinking water treatment facilities in Tennessee. Air Quality \u2014 Tennessee is working with nine other states to implement the EnvironmentalProtection Agency's (EPA's) stringent ambientair quality standards for ozone, fine particulate matter, and regional haze. In compliance with the federal Title V program, Tennessee continues to issue new,more complex operating permits for majorstationary sources of air pollution. Also,Tennessee continues to work with the TennesseeValley Authority (TVA) toward early reductionof nitrogen oxides. Tennessee will host the third Governors' Summit on Mountain Air Quality in 2001. Thesummit brings the plight of the mountains to theattention of the highest levels in stategovernments. In 2000, Tennessee chaired theSouthern Appalachian Mountain Initiative. Thisinitiative, which is near completion, seeks toidentify the causes of air quality related impactsin the mountains and to reverse their adverseeffects on the mountains. Solid and Hazardous Waste \u2014 TDEC remediated over 300 contaminated sites in 2000,and responded to over 400 contacts from theTennessee Emergency Management Agency. Asa function of site remediation and permitting,TDEC has also established a risk basedevaluation program to further evaluate potentialenvironmental impacts of sites and facilities. In 2000, responsible parties spent $13.7 million on cleanup of contaminated Superfundsites. In addition, 56,000 cubic yards ofcontaminated soil were treated or hauled toappropriate disposal sites, and 768 milliongallons of contaminated water were pumped andtreated. Through regional planning, the numberof sanitary landfills was reduced by 30% since1999 and the waste volume reduced by 21%since 1989. EPA granted full authorization to Tennessee's Hazardous Waste Program andTennessee's Lead Base Paint AbatementProgram. Strong Enforcement for Polluters \u2014TDEC has worked to move swiftly against those who breakenvironmental laws. The department has cut thetime it takes to issue an enforcement order byover 70% since 1994. TDEC issued 776 enforcement orders, assessing over $7.7 millionin 2000, compared to 118 orders and $1.1million in 1994. The year 1999 saw 315 ordersissued, with penalties assessed at $4 million(excluding the $14 million DOE penalty). Improving Customer Service \u2014 Through its reengineering efforts, TDEC has simplified thepermitting process and provided greater accessto environmental information services. EightEnvironmental Assistance Centers (EACs)across the state can be accessed by a single toll-free hot line, 1-888-891-TDEC. The department is also implementing an environmental justice plan to provide a safer,cleaner environment to all Tennesseans.Tennessee has the opportunity to be the modelfor the nation with this innovative program. Conservation State Parks \u2014 Tennessee State Parks continue to set a standard for excellence. Fall Creek Fallswas once again named \"Southern Living\"readers' choice for top resort park in thesoutheast. Over 30 million people visit Tennessee State Parks each year. To accommodate thisdemand and to help the park system becomemore financially self-sufficient, the departmentis implementing a new central reservationsystem. The department is also installing a newcomputerized hospitality management system toprovide better control and use of the inns,cabins, golf courses, marinas, and restaurantsthroughout the seven resorts. In addition,Tennessee State Parks has reorganized toinclude a separate division to manage the entireretail operations of the resort parks. To support park maintenance, the department is instituting user fees at four stateparks. The department will extend the user feepolicy to more parks as it becomes feasible. The State Parks web site continues to draw a record crowd, with approximately threemillion visits in 2000, almost double the numberof visits to its web site in 1999. Recreation Education \u2014 In 2000, TDECcontinued to ensure effective grant management for state parks and local governments withapproximately 130 open grants. The Local Parkand Recreation Fund (LPRF) grants to localgovernment were restructured under a two-yearcycle, with grants of approximately $7 millionto be awarded in 2001. The federal RecreationTrails Program (RTP) awarded 25 grantstotaling $1.3 million. Three TennesseeRecreation Initiative Program (TRIP) grantsawarded a total $150,000. Of the $715,000received in federal Land, Water, andConservation Fund (LWCF) dollars, $644,372was awarded to the Cumberland Trail. The 2001LWCF apportionment of approximately $1.7million will be awarded to state and localprojects. The Governor's Council on Greenways and Trails is gearing up to present its plan to theGovernor and implement the state plan by hiringof a full-time coordinator. Parks and RecreationTechnical Advisory Service (PARTAS)assistance continued in 2000 on a limited basisto ensure effective development and to meet theimprovements that are planned for 2001. State Natural Areas \u2014 TDEC's Division of Natural Heritage continues to maintain recordson known locations of plant and animal speciesof state and federal concern, throughout thestate. In 2000, Tennessee acquired additional land to expand four existing State NaturalAreas. Two new State Natural Areas wereestablished, bringing the total number of StateNatural Areas to 60. These 60 State NaturalAreas, covering some 85,000 acres, serve toprotect the habitat of rare and endangeredspecies of plants and animals. They also provideopportunities for passive outdoor recreationsuch as nature photography and study andhiking. State Natural Areas are perpetuallyprotected from development. The division is also forging partnerships with large industrial forestland owners inTennessee to cooperatively protect importanthabitat for rare species on their lands. Geology and Archaeology \u2014 TDEC enteredinto a partnership agreement with the National Park Service to analyze environmental impactsto oil and gas wells at Big South Fork NationalRiver and Recreation Area. TDEC's Division ofGeology served more than 2,400 customers, soldnearly $66,000 in maps, and provided lecturesand field trips to more than 1,200 individuals.TDEC also produced up-to-date earthquakeamplification potential maps for Memphis,Tennessee, and Blytheville, Arkansas. TDEC's Division of Archaeology maintains records on 20,000 known archaeological sitesand all previous studies in the State ofTennessee. Using this information, division staffworks with federal, state, and local governmentand private developers to find innovative waysto protect and preserve archaeological sites. Responsible and Accountable Government The Sundquist Administration remains committed to creating a more effective, efficientand user-friendly state government. By workingwith each department to set goals, establishpriorities, and foster a climate of responsibilityand accountability, this vision is becoming areality in Tennessee. During the past year the state has made significant progress towards creating a moreuser-friendly government by allowing citizens toconduct business with the state anytime, via theinternet. This action, which improvedaccessibility to state services and providedconvenience for the customer, has also resultedin more efficient processes and long-term costsavings. Examples of services that are availablethrough the internet are: the renewal of drivers'licenses, reservations at state parks, andverification of TennCare eligibility. The state has also moved closer to the opening of its first One-Stop Shopping center.Projected to open in 2002, this pilot facility willallow our customers to conduct business withmultiple departments under one roof. Theagencies that may be housed in the One-StopShopping center are the Department of Health,Department of Labor and WorkforceDevelopment, Department of Correction, Boardof Probation and Parole, Department ofChildren's Services, Tennessee Bureau ofInvestigation, Department of Revenue, and theDepartment of Safety. Cost savings willcertainly result from the construction of thisfacility, but more importantly, customer servicewill be enhanced. Similar efforts, focusing onimproving customer service, reducing the costof doing business, and creating operational efficiencies through the use of technology andinnovation, will continue to be pursued. The importance of qualified and dedicated employees can never be overlooked by anorganization attempting to refine itself. It is forthis reason that the Administration has chosen tofocus on improving employee recruitment andretention. The ability to attract and retainexceptional employees will go a long waytoward meeting the demanding goals the statehas set for itself. This Administration is working to achieve these goals through the use of classification-compensation salary adjustments, employee payraises, and the Leadership DevelopmentInitiative, a supervisory training program. Inclassification-compensation studies, theDepartment of Personnel compares state salariesfor selected positions each fiscal year withsalaries for similar positions in the private sectorand surrounding state governments. For the lastseveral fiscal years, the budget has includedfunds to upgrade pay for positions with asignificant difference between state and privatesector salaries. General across-the-boardincreases in pay help salaries keep pace withinflation, while training programs help to ensurethat we have a well trained work force. Ensuring that government acts responsibly and is accountable for its actions and decisionsis a public demand. Because of this demand thestate will continue to cut expense and waste byvalidating essential services, focusing on cost-avoidance initiatives, and emphasizing frauddetection. Maximizing revenue due andavailable to the state also remains a strong focus of the Administration. In this 2001-2002 Budget Document, for the first time, the State is publishing detailedperformance measures and program informationas an integral part of the budget. Although thisprogram information has been used for decadesby budget staff in analyzing requests - and hasbeen provided annually to legislative staff - thisis the first time the information has beenintegrated into the Budget Document forconvenient review by all members of theGeneral Assembly. This first effort atpublishing the information as part of the budgetleaves some room for improvement. However, the information should help the GeneralAssembly analyze the work of the agencies, andthe budgetary pressures on them, as they provideservices and respond to the critical needs of thepeople. Tennessee's citizens expect nothing less than exceptional service, responsibility,accountability, efficiency, and effectivenessfrom State Government. The Administration isworking hard to meet - and exceed - theseexpectations.1990 2000 Total Population 4,877,203 5,689,283 1990 1999 Total Population 4,877,203 5,483,535 Percent of Population Under Age 5 7.0% 6.7% Percent of Population Age 5 to 17 18.1% 17.8% Percent of Population Age 18 to 24 10.9% 9.5% Percent of Population Age 25 to 64 51.4% 53.6% Percent of Population Age 65 and Older 12.6% 12.4% Median Age 33.5 36.2 Percent of Population by Race White 83.0% 82.1% 16.0% Hispanic Population 0.7% 1.2% Per Capita Income $21,800 $25,574 Tennessee's Rank in U.

The Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Tennessee prepared this summary of current economic conditions and expectations for short-term economic growth in Tennessee and the nation. For additional information, see the most recent edition of \"An Economic Report to the Governor of the State of Tennessee.\" Recent Economic Conditions - The Tennessee economy will enter its second decade of uninterrupted growth in 2001, the longest economic expansion of modern times. A good indication of the economy's strength is the unemployment rate, which despite increases at the end of the year was still projected to average only 3.7 percent in 2000. Many areas of Tennessee have experienced unemployment rates below this remarkably low level, especially in the middle Tennessee region. The state unemployment rate compares quite favorably with the 4.1 percent rate expected for the nation in 2000. Despite expectations for sustained growth, there are signs that the national and state economies are slowing, and the chances of an economic contraction have risen in recent months. Early 2000 brought with it continued concerns about the heated pace of economic growth and the potential for inflation to escalate due to a combination of strong consumer demand and tight labor markets. The Federal Reserve (Fed) responded by raising interest rates in 1999 and early 2000, with the last rate increase introduced in May. By summer, fuel prices were rising, taking a bite out of business profits and consumer discretionary income. As winter set in, higher interest rates and fuel prices, coupled with capacity constraints and a host of other factors, appeared to have caused an appreciable slowing in economic activity. At the December meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee - midway through the state's 2000-01 fiscal year - the Fed shifted its policy stance by stating that concerns about a slowing economy had supplanted concerns about rising inflation. The Fed subsequently surprised the markets with a halfpercentage point cut in the federal funds rate and a cut in the discount rate. While nominal gross domestic product was expected to grow 7.4 percent in 2000, growth in 2001 is now projected at a cooler 5.4 percent. The state and national economies enter 2001 at a critical juncture. With economic growth likely to taper off in the new year, the only question is: How much? Fortunately, conditions seem sufficiently strong to ward off recession, especially in light of the shift in Fed monetary policy. Further interest rate cuts can be expected in 2001 if economic conditions show signs of deterioration. The Tennessee state economy showed signs of slowing in the latter part of 2000, though rates of growth remained respectable. While year-over-year nonagricultural job growth advanced 1.6 percent in the first quarter of 2000 and 1.9 percent in the second quarter, growth slowed to 1.1 percent in the third quarter. Calendar year job growth is projected to be 1.5 percent for the state. Job growth for the nation was flat in the third quarter. Nonetheless, U.S. job growth should tally 2.1 percent for the year. Weakness is still apparent in the state's manufacturing sector, particularly nondurable goods manufacturing. The state unemployment rate moved above the 4.0 percent barrier in November. Nominal personal income in Tennessee should have grown 5.8 percent in 2000 versus 6.4 percent for the nation. Tennessee taxable sales have fallen off sharply since the first quarter of 2000, with growth of only 4.4 percent projected for 2000. Short-term Economic Outlook - While the economy is expected to cool off in 2001 and 2002, a substantial drop in economic activity is not expected. The Fed will monitor economic conditions carefully to see if further interest rate reductions are warranted. The Tennessee Leading Economic Index , as well as the leading index for the national economy, calls for sustained but subdued growth into the second quarter of 2001. The Quarterly Tennessee Econometric Model , which provides greater detail on the expected path of economic growth, points to a continuation of growth through 2002. Nonagricultural job growth in Tennessee and the nation should register 1.2percent in 2001, with slight improvement anticipated for 2002. The state unemployment rate will rise further and average 4.3 percent in 2001, compared to 4.4 percent for the nation. Nominal personal income in Tennessee will be up 5.5 percent in 2001, corresponding to the same rate of growth as the U.S. Tennessee per capita income in 2000 was $26,795, or 88.7 percent of the national average,down from 90.0 percent in 1997. Per capita income is expected to grow 4.3 percent in 2001. For fiscal year 2000-01, nominal personal income will be up 5.4 and nominal taxable sales will advance 4.1 percent. Personal income should grow 5.8 percent in 2001-02 and taxable sales should grow 4.4 percent.

If the state were still receiving 27 cents of every budgeted dollar as federal aid, an additional $883.6 million would be available in federal funds. In constant (2001-2002) dollars, federal aid has increased by 60.9 percent, or $1.045 billion, from 1979-80 to 2000-2001 for state programs other than Food Stamps, Medicaid, and TANF/AFDC grants. Figure 1 and Table 1 show the constant dollar (2001-2002) trend in federal aid in the state budget since 1979-80 for all programs, including transportation. Amounts for fiscalyears 1979-80 through 1999-2000 are based on actual federal aid collections; amounts for 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 are based on estimates included in the recommended state budget. Current dollars have been converted to real (co nstant) dollars using the gross domestic product implicit price deflator, as reported by the Un iversity of Tennessee Center for Business and Economic Research. The decline in federal aid in the early 1980s (Figure 1) reflects the elimination of federal revenue sharing for states, new federal restrictions on eligibility for the TANF/AFDC pr ogram, and the con- solidation of several federal grant programs into block grants at reduced levels. From 1988-89 to 2001-2002, all the programs other than TANF/AFDC and Food Stamps have had real growth. This r eflects congre ssional decisions in the late 1980s to relax the earlier federal deficit- control statutes, which had restrained the growth of dome stic discretionary programs during the 1980s. As shown in Figure 1, not until 1994-95 does \"all other\" federal aid, excluding Medicaid, TANF/AFDC grants, and Food Stamps return to the real-dollar level available to the state in 1979-80. Reflecting recent domestic initiatives, the growth rate for this federal aid category has begun to increase, in spite of federalbudget-balancing efforts. In 2001-2002, \"all other\" federal aid, excluding Food Stamps, Medicaid, and TANF/AFDC, shows a constant-dollar increase compared with the year before. This is mainly because of an increase for education and social services programs. Over the 22-year period, Medicaid, the major federal entitlement pr ogram in the state budget, has had real growth well above the rate of inflation, while TANF/AFDC payments and Food Stamps have declined slightly. Although total federal aid has increased in constant dollars by 140.6 percent from 1979-80 to 2001-2002, the 590.6 percent real growth in the Medicaid program is accompanied by real growth of only 60.9 percent in federal aid for all other state programs, excluding Food Stamps and TANF/AFDC. A constant dollar decline of 14.9 percent in federal aid for the TANF/AFDC grants program since 1979-80 is related to Tennessee's continued economic growth, increased child support collections, the impact of job training programs, and implementation of federal and state welfare reform. Over the 22- year period, as shown in T able 1, real growth for all federal aid to state programs has averaged 4.1 percent per year. This growth abovethe rate of inflation has been led by the 9.2 percent annual-average real growth in the Medicaid program. TANF/AFDC and Food Stamps have declined, and all other federal aid has had a moderate increase on an annual-average basis. Over the last 13 years of the period, from 1988-89 through 2001-2002, real growth in total federal aid has increased above the longer-term growth rates. Total federal aid to state programs has grown at a 13-year annual-average rate of 6.7 percent. Real growth in this period has averaged 9.7 percent per year for Med icaid and 0.7 percent per year in Food Stamps, while TANF/AFDC has declined 0.7 percent. All other federal aid has grown at a real-dollar rate of 5.6 percent per year. The high growth rates in the Medicaid program in the late 1980s and early 1990s had begun to moderate, possibly because of managed care and the economy. However, the growth rate for Medicaid appears to be rising again, perhaps as a result of the recent policy changes in the TennCare program. The federal Medicaid match rate also has declined in recent years, although it will increase for the second year on October 1, 2002. The increase in the federal match rate caused a decline in the state cost for federal mandates for FY 2002. Medicaid accounts for 78% of the state mandate cost. The longer-term federal fun ding for mandated Figure 2 Existing Federal Mandates State Cost Since FY 1987 Chart in Millions 97.6343.8 17.4 24.963.0126.2153.6181.7211.7244.2282.2322.2339.8 11.6321.9 319.8 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 2000 01 02 Fiscal YearTable 1 Comparison of Federal Aid in State Budget, Actual 1979-80 through Estimated 2001-2002 In Millions of Constant (2001-2002) Dollars Increase Annual Medicaid expansions is accompanied by significant state costs, which are identified in detail below. While federal aid as a percentage of discretionary program funding has declined in the state budget since 1979-80, federal legislation in the late 1980s and early 1990s has imposed increasingly costly mandates on state government. By fiscal year 2001-2002, when existing federal mandates will have been fully implemented, provisions imposed since 1986-87 will cost $319.8 million per year in recurring state appr opriations from General Fund tax sources. The cumulative state cost in 2000-2001 is $321.9 million and in 2001- 2002 is $319.8 million. Fi gure 2 illustrates the annual recurring state cost, from General Fund tax sources, of new federal mandates beginning in fiscal year 1986-87. New mandatory provisions of the Medicaid program account for 80 percent of the federally mandated costs. No new program mandates costing state funds have been enacted by Congress in the last year. Almost all of the growth in federally mandated costs beginning with fiscal year 1996-97 is caused by the continued decline in federal match rates under old laws. Costly major Medicaid mandates imposed since 1986-87 (Figure 3) are expanded ser vices under the 1988 catastrophic health care law; coverage of children aged 1 through 18 under 1989 and 1990 laws; payment of prem iums and deductibles for poor Medicare clients under a 1990 law; increase in the minimum wage for the nursing home program under a 1989 law; increases in the state Medicaid match rate as personal income increases; e xpansion of Medicaid eligibility under the 1988 federal welfare reform law; and drug purchasing reform under a 1990 law. Other Medicaid mandates include the 1988 nursing home reform initiative and the expansion of the child disability standard under the 1990 \"Zebley\" court ruling on supplemental security income regulations. Major federal mandates i mposed in other programs since fiscal year 1986-87 (Figure 4) include expansion of AFDCeligibility and support services u nder the 1988 federal welfare reform law; exemption from the sales tax of food stamps and supplemental foods for women, infants, and children; increases in the state match rate for the former AFDC pr ogram; intervention services for handicapped infants and toddlers in the K-12 education system; extensions of federal social security and Medicare payroll taxes under the 1990 federal budget act; national standards under the commercial drivers license law; and other items of lesser fiscal i mpact affecting several state agencies. For purposes of this analysis, the term \"federal mandates\" is limited to provisions of federal law or regulation which require state government implementation, without option to the state. This includes mandatory new pr ograms, changes in existing federal programs, and increases in state financial participation in jointly funded federal programs resulting from decreases in federal match rates.

A-99State of Tennessee State Tax Revenues Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 2001-2002 The revenues necessary to finance state government are collected from a variety ofsources. The primary source of funding for stateexpenditures is appropriation from generalrevenues. General revenues are proceeds fromtaxes, licenses, fees, fines, forfeitures, and otherimposts laid specifically by law. The revenue estimating process generally starts twelve months before a fiscal year begins.Revenue collections are tracked on a monthlybasis, and this information, along with specificlong-run forecasts of individual sectors of theeconomy, is used to form the basis for the nextfiscal year's estimated revenue collections. Preliminary estimates are supplied to the Department of Finance and Administration in mid-summer by the Department of Revenue and theUniversity of Tennessee Center for Business andEconomic Research. Tax estimates arerecalculated in October and November and refinedin December and January for inclusion in theGovernor's Budget Document. Sales tax estimates are based on estimated retail sales activity which is provided by theCenter for Business and Economic Research.Corporate excise tax estimates are made as late aspossible in the year to take advantage of the latestavailable corporate profit forecasts for the nationand the October state tax returns filed with theDepartment of Revenue, which provideinformation useful in projecting quarterlyestimated corporate tax payments through the nextyear. Estimates for selective excise taxes are commonly based on long-run consumption trendsfor the selectively-taxed items: cigarettes,gasoline, beer, and alcoholic beverages. Long-runtrend analysis is also used as a basis for projectingcorporate excise and franchise tax collections andTennessee Valley Authority in lieu of taxpayments. Motor vehicle fuel (primarily diesel fuel) taxes and motor vehicle registration fees areestimated conservatively, given their sensitivity to business cycles (especially the truck-relatedcomponents of both taxes). The revenue estimating process in Tennessee incorporates the \"Good Practices in RevenueEstimating\" endorsed by the National Associationof State Budget Officers and the Federation of TaxAdministrators. This requires the use of nationaland state economic forecasts, development of anofficial revenue estimate, monitoring and monthlyreporting on revenue collections, and revision ofestimates when appropriate. TCA 9-4-5104, 5105, 5106, and 5202 specify the manner in which tax revenue estimates areprepared and transmitted to the General Assemblyin the Budget Document. The Commissioner of Finance and Administration prepares revenue estimates basedon advice from economists, his own staff, theDepartment of Revenue, and the State FundingBoard. The Funding Board, which is composed ofthe Governor, the Commissioner of Finance andAdministration, the Comptroller, the StateTreasurer, and the Secretary of State, is assisted inpreparing its range of revenue growth estimates byeconomists from the state's universities, theexecutive director of the Fiscal ReviewCommittee, and staff of the Department of Financeand Administration and of the Treasurer's Office.Using the information provided by the economists,the executive director of the Fiscal ReviewCommittee, and staff, a range of revenue growthestimates is prepared and recommended by theFunding Board. The Funding Board's review and recommendations concern only the taxes collectedby the Department of Revenue. The growthestimates provide a basis for the tax revenueestimates that are used in preparing the budget.However, recommendation of revenue estimates inthe Budget is the responsibility of the Governorand Commissioner of Finance and Administration. The State Funding Board's most recent letternotifying the Governor and the chairmen of the Senate and House Finance, Ways and Meanscommittees of its revenue growth estimates isincluded in the following subsection entitled\"State Funding Board, Range of Tax RevenueEstimates.\" This letter states the economicassumptions affecting the Funding Board'srecommendations. A more detailed economicoverview is presented in the \"Budget Overview\"section of the Budget Document. The tax revenue estimates recommended in the Budget Document are shown in a followingsubsection entitled \"Comparison Statement ofState Revenues.\" These taxes include not only thetaxes collected by the Department of Revenue (themajor taxes), but also those collected anddeposited to the General Fund by some other lineagencies in conjunction with carrying out theirprograms. In the revenue estimate charts, the latterare shown by collecting agency and are subtotaledas \"other state revenue.\" Following the chart comparing taxes for the three fiscal years, three charts are included to showthe collections distributed by fund. The funds onthe distribution charts, for Budget Documentpresentation, are General Fund, Education (Trust)Fund, Highway (Transportation) Fund, SinkingFund (Debt Service Fund), and Cities and Counties(Local Government Fund). (For information aboutthe inclusion of certain Special Revenue Fundtaxes and fees in the General Fund estimates, seethe \"Budget Overview\" subsection entitled \"Basisof Budgeting and Accounting.\") Following the four tax revenue estimate charts is a chart detailing the revenues ofregulatory boards, with the collections andestimates listed by board. This is a supportingschedule to the \"Comparison Statement of StateRevenues\" charts, on which single lines forregulatory board fees appear. In addition to the general revenues detailed inthis section, other revenues are collected by departments, institutions, and agencies and areappropriated directly to them. These are calleddepartmental revenues. In the Budget Document,these departmental revenues are estimated byprogram and are shown as federal revenue, otherrevenue (or, sometimes, current services and otherrevenue), and tuition and fees. The term \"otherrevenue\" includes interdepartmental revenue,current services revenue, non-governmentalrevenue, and revenue from cities and counties.These various departmental revenues consist ofearnings and charges for goods and services;student tuition and fees in the higher educationsystem; and donations, contributions, and grants-in-aid from the federal government, politicalsubdivisions, foundations, corporations, andindividuals. In a few cases, the other departmentalrevenues also include reserves from revolvingfunds or from the unencumbered balance andcapital outlay (major maintenance) reserves, ininstances in which specific legal authority to carrysuch funds forward exists. The departmentalrevenues are reflected in each department's budgetas operating revenue. Information presented in the subsection entitled \"Revenue Sources and Basis ofApportionment\" outlines the general tax revenuesby collecting agency, along with Tennessee Code Annotated (TCA) citations on the rate and source of the revenue and the basis of apportionmentamong funds and agencies. The tax revenue estimates proposed in this Budget are provided in a following subsectionentitled \"Comparison Statement of StateRevenues, Actual and Estimated July 1, 1999 -June 30, 2002.\" Following that subsection is a subsection detailing so-called tax expenditures, which reportson major tax exemptions provided by law.State Funding Board Range of Tax Revenue EstimatesSTATE OF TENNESSEE COMPTROLLER OF THE TREASURY State Capital Nashville, Tennessee 37243-0260 (615) 741-2501 John G Morgan Comptroller December 11, 2000 MEMORANDUM TO: The Honorable Don Sundquist Governor The Honorable Douglas Henry, Chairman Senate Finance, Ways and Means Committee The Honorable Matt Kisber, Chairman House Finance, Ways and Means Committee FROM: John Morgan Comptroller of the Treasury Riley Darnell Secretary of State Steve Adams State Treasurer C. Warren Neel, Ph.D Commissioner of Finance & Administration SUBJECT: Revenue Estimates The State Funding Board met on December 5, 2000 to hear presentations about the State's near-term economic outlook and estimates of State tax revenue collections for the fiscal years 2000-01 and 2001-2002. Presenters included Mr. Jim Davenport of the Fiscal Review Committee, Dr. Albert DePrince of Middle Tennessee State University, Dr. John Gnuschke of the University of Memphis, and Dr. William Fox of the University of Tennessee. A spreadsheet that summarizes the State tax revenue estimates as presented is attached to this memorandum (Attachment 1 for FY 2000-01 and Attachment 2 for FY 2001-02). The Board met again on December 7, 2000 to finalize its deliberations on ranges for tax revenue growth rates. The consensus of presenters was that Tennessee's economy will continue to grow over the projection period at a slower rate than that experienced over the last several years. As has been the case for the last two years, presenters noted that high employment levels continue to exist, with the result that potential for higher business growth is being somewhat constrained by labor availability. Testimony also indicates that interest rate increases implemented by the Federal Reserve Board to address the rate of national economic growth have taken hold, with the impact being seen throughout the economy. Warning signs observed include falling levels of consumer confidence and a three month decline in the index of leading economic indicators. Presenters believe that the likelihood of a recession during the projection period is not significant.Memorandum Page 2 With regard to state tax revenues, presenters were in agreement that continued growth at the robust levels seen over the last several years is unlikely. This is particularly true for the sales tax where recent weakness has become evident. Attachment 3 is a graph prepared by Dr. Fox that illustrates this point by showing sales tax revenue growth since January, 1999 (three month moving average). This graph clearly shows that growth in sales tax revenues dropped sharply, beginning in April 2000. Reduction in growth rates for both vehicle sales and housing starts, which are primary drivers of sales tax growth, is also evident. This is shown in Attachment 4 which compares growth in sales tax revenues by category for the last three years and indicates that receipts resulting from automobile dealers, building materials, and furniture and home furnishings are lagging behind levels seen in the last two years. As in past years, presenters noted that, while not precisely measurable, sales of goods over the Internet continue to be considered a threat to sales tax growth. All presenters expressed a degree of caution as to franchise and excise tax estimates. With increasing interest rates, the profit outlook for corporations has dimmed somewhat. Since corporate profits form the basis for the excise tax, growth in this tax type will be negatively impacted. Lastly, it should be noted that major revisions in Tennessee's corporate tax law was effected in 1999, with the impact of those changes yet to be fully realized. Based upon the presentations made and discussions that followed, the Board has developed consensus revenue estimates for the current and next fiscal years. These estimates are expressed in ranges of growth rates in State tax revenue collections. The following table summarizes these estimates: FY 2000-01 FY 2001-02 4.10% General Fund Only 1.75% 2.25% 4.00% 4.50% The Board believes these are conservative and reasonable estimates. With regard to the FY 2000-01 estimate, it should be noted that the underlying growth rate (i.e. adjusting out tax policy changes) through November, 2000 is 2.47%. To achieve the low end of the growth range for FY 2000-01 will require revenue growth for the remainder of the year to equal 3.45%, while growth required to achieve the high end of the range requires growth of 4.18%. In summary, the growth rate ranges for FY 2000-01 assume improvement in revenue growth performance during the remainder of the year as compared with performance through November. For FY 2001-02, the estimate assumes a return to normal growth patterns seen during mature stages of an economic cycle. As in past years, the Board intends to revisit the estimates in late April or early May of the year 2001. At that time, updated information should be available on all tax collections, particularly those of our major tax types, the sales, franchise and excise tax. Each of you will be advised of any revisions made by the Board at that time. We will be happy to discuss these matters with you further at your convenience. Attachment cc. The Honorable John S.

This section of the Budget Document is intended to fulfill that statutory obligation. Under the law, the tax expenditure report is required to \"...identify all exemptions, to the extent that it is practical, and estimate the amount of revenue which would have been collected by the state in the fiscal year commencing on July 1 next succeeding such report had each exemption not existed.\" The report on vendor compensation is required to show the amount paid to vendors for the collection of the sales tax. No format or reporting period is specified. Both reports are to be made no later than February 1 of each year. Vendors compensation for collection of the sales tax was repealed, effective July 1, 2000, by Public Acts of 2000, chapter 983. Thus, no report is made on vendors compensation. Tax Exemptions It is not possible to estimate the amount of revenue lost for each of the tax exemptions found in the Tennessee code. For example, since 1947, the list of non-profit institutions that are exempt from the sales tax has grown dramatically. Such institutions are allowed tobuy tangible goods and certain services tax free. Retailers and sellers require proof of exemption and keep records of exempt sales; but tax returns filed with the Department of Revenue do not show detailed statistics on exempt sales by type of exempt entity. Such data is only available in the records of the thousands of individual retailers and vendors who sell directly to the public. Therefore, the tax exemptions listed in the present report consist only of those that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The fiscal impact of Tennessee's major tax exemptions is presented in tabular form in Tables 1-A and 1-B. Estimates of revenue loss are provided for FY 2001-2002. Table 1-A presents revenue foregone on services not currently taxed. These services represent activities that were not included in the original tax base. Table 1-B presents revenue foregone due to specific exemptions in the existing sales tax law. For each item in this table, the exemption is briefly described and the specific authorization of the Tennessee code is cited. It is difficult to estimate the true cost of tax exemptions for two reasons. First, each exemption is considered separately, without regard to how it overlaps with other provisions of the tax code. Summing tax exemptions may result in double-counting in cases where exemptions overlap. Secondly, the estimates of revenue loss provided in the tables do not generally take into account the impact of a change in a particular tax provision on taxpayer behavior which impacts other taxes (the estimates do not reflect secondary or feedback effects).Service/Product Area Exempted State Local* Administrative & Support Services $193,800,000 $72,700,000 Collection Agencies & Credit Bureaus 15,900,000 5,900,000 Employment Services 105,500,000 39,600,000 Investigation & Security Services 21,800,000 8,200,000 Mail, Document Reproduction, & Call Centers 11,600,000 4,400,000 Services to Buildings & Dwellings 39,000,000 14,600,000 Construction Services $694,800,000 $260,600,000 Building, Developing, & General Contracting 349,100,000 130,900,000 Heavy Construction 58,300,000 21,900,000 Special Trade Educational Services (for-profit) 9,800,000 3,700,000 Educational Services (non-profit) 1,500,000 600,000 Finance, Insurance, & Real Estate $154,900,000 $58,100,000 Investment.

It was created by the 45th General Assembly through passage of Public Chapter 126, Public Acts of 1887, codified as Title 9, Chapter 9, Section 101 of the Tennessee Code. By statute, the state's full faith and credit, as well as specific tax revenues, are pledged for the payment of principal and interest on state bonds. Additionally, the law covenants that such pledged revenues shall not be less than 150 percent of the amount necessary to service the state's outstanding debt and any debt proposed to be issued. Adequate safeguards are therefore embodied in law against the issuance of excessive debt, and the state's current and future debt service requirements are well below the established legal limits. Over the years, Tennessee has consistently maintained a relatively low debt burden. This has been accomplished through the use of sound, prudent, and conservative debt management practices adopted by the executive and legislative branches of government, with concurrence of the State Funding Board. Such practices include funding of the state's capital program with surplus cash, cancellation of bond authorizations in lieu of issuing debt, creating and maintaining an adequate \"Rainy Day Fund\" to offset unanticipated revenue shortfalls, and the adoption of state statutes to control the issuance of excessive debt. This consistent and conservative approach to the management of our debt has long earned the state favorable bond ratings from the nation's leading rating agencies. Fitch Investment Services rates the state of Tennessee bonds AAA, Standard and Poor's Corporation AA+, and Moody's Investors Service Aa-1. Such favorable ratings have consistently enabled the state to market its bonds at very low rates of interest as compared with many other states and local governments.The state sold $150 million in general obligation bonds in August of 2000. No bond sales were conducted in fiscal year 1999-2000. At least one additional general obligation bond sale is anticipated to occur prior to the close of this fiscal period. As of June 30, 2000, Tennessee's total general obligation bonded indebtedness was $858,273,000. This debt was issued entirely for institutional and building construction. The second session of the 101st General Assembly approved new authorizations in the amount of $204,390,000. Of this amount, institutional and building bonds accounted for $97.290 million, the Facilities Revolving Fund $19.4 million, and highway bonds $87.7 million. The practice of using the state's cash flow to finance road projects in lieu of issuing debt has been one of the key factors in Tennessee's ability to secure and retain very high bond ratings. Consistent with this long standing policy, the Funding Board, within the last 18 months has cancelled $171.5 million in highway bond authorizations and $34.8 million in institutional and building construction bonds. The increase in bond authorization coupled with the Funding Board's action on bond cancellation reduced the category of authorized but unissued bonds to $1,199,201,173, a reduction of $65,021,327 from a year ago. The FY 2001-2002 proposed budget recommends the authorization of an additional $80,000,000 in highway construction bonds, $147,700,000 in institutional and building bonds, and $56,630,000 in cash to finance capital projects. The proposed budget also includes $61.3 million in bond authorization for the Facilities Revolving Fund. Tennessee's commitment to prudent and conservative debt management should ensure continued excellent ratings from the rating agencies and allow the state to receive very competitive rates of interest on future issues.Debt Service Fund Comparative Balance Sheet June 30, 1999, and June 30, 2000 June 30, 1999 June 30, 2000 Cash and Cash Equivalents $207,000 $814,000 Receivables: Taxes 3,430,000 3,559,000 Unreserved: Service $1,335,000 $2,750,000 Total Fund Balance $1,335,000 $2,750,000 Total Liabilities and Fund Balance $19,637,000 $19,173,000Assets Liabilities and Fund BalanceDebt Service Fund Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Requirements July 1, 1999 -

A-127State of Tennessee Capital Budget Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 2001 - 2002 The Capital Budget process begins with the receipt of departmental and agency capital maintenance and project requests. The various agencies and departments annually submit their capital requests in priority order to the Depar t- ment of Finance and Administration, Division of Budget. Upon receipt of the capital budget requests, three phases of review are undertaken by the Division of Capital Projects and Real Property Management and the Division of Budget. The initial phase allows for an understanding of the need by the Capital Projects and Real Property Management and Budget review teams. Phase two is built upon the technical requirements of the capital request, involving on-site visits by the r e- view teams. The final phase involves financial review. The projects are analyzed for funding requirements and consistency with program goals and are reviewed within projected availability of funds in the budget for the requested fiscal year. If funds are deemed to be insufficient, individual projects may be deferred to be included in future budgets or rejected. The Administration intends for the needs of departmental programs to be the impetus for all capital outlay requirements. Facilities funded through the capital budget process should support program and service requirements. Therefore, funding of projects is analyzed on priority of fiscal support for individual existing and new programs. The goal is to find the best mix of new capital outlay and facility maintenance in order to sustain and implement programs and services. The management of facilities should be flex i- ble enough to adjust to changing programs through renovation of existing assets. Attempts are made to minimize operational costs and future capital expenditures through better design and more flexible layouts, as has been done in the state's new prisons. In the event that a capitalproject creates the need for additional operational funding, those funds are considered in the deve l- opment of the budget in the year when the new space is expected to be occupied. Improvements to real property funded by public or private funds must be approved by the State Building Commission. The State Building Commission is composed of seven ex-officio members: the Governor, the Secretary of State, the Comptroller of the Treasury, the Commi s- sioner of Finance and Administration, the Trea s- urer, and the Speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives. The State Building Commi s- sion, in addition to supervising improvements to real property, oversees leases by state agencies and the demolition of structures located on state property. The capital items presented in this document as recommendations to the General Assembly consist of projects meeting the requirements and policy guidelines of the State Building Commi s- sion. The capital project recommendations are itemized by department. Capital maintenance projects are defined as major, non-routine repairs, and replacements u n- related to new construction that cost $100,000 or more. Maintenance projects costing less than this amount are considered to be major maint e- nance items that are addressed within the d e- partments' operational budget major maintenance programs. Capital maintenance projects include items that appreciably extend the life of the faci l- ity, such as alterations to rectify code deficie n- cies, modifica tions to improve utility systems, repaving , roof repairs, exterior fencing and ligh t- ing, and repair projects that restore a facility to its former con dition and do not result in changes in facility use. Funding for these projects is i n- cluded in the amount allocated to the Department of Finance and Administration, and projects areCapital Budget selected for completion according to the review process ou tlined above. Capital projects are defined as those pr ovid- ing new facilities or materially extending the us e- ful life and improving or changing the function of an existing facility. These projects include facility renovation, new construction, new utility or ser v- ice systems, land with or without buildings, a p- purtenances, site improvements or permanent betterments, and initial equipment to furnish and operate a new or improved facility which require the assistance of a design professional or cost $100,000 or more. For fiscal year 2001-2002, the capital projects budget proposal recommends a total of $239,147,200 divided between capital outlays and capital maintenance requests. Capital Maintenance \u2014 Capital maintenance projects are recommended at a level of $78,387,000. State bond authorization is reco m- mended in the amount of $35,520,000 along with $32,137,000 in state appropriations. Federal and other sources equal the remainder of the total amount. These projects focus on maintaining current facilities, primarily through repair and renovation of roofing, mechanical, and electrical systems. Funding is also included to bring state facilities in line with federal standards for unde r- ground storage tanks, asbestos, and citizens with disabilities. The Tennessee Board of Regents and the University of Tennessee are also funded for modifications to assist in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

................................ Education Excellence B-93 Improvements (K-12 Program System ................................ Improvements ................................ ................................ .......... B-140State of Tennessee Education Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 2001 - 2002 B-81his functional area is responsible for the educational efforts of the state, from pre-school and K-12 through all levels of higher education. The Department of Education coordinates the educational programs of the local public school systems that operate Tennessee's kinder garten, elementary, secondary, and vocational schools. The department also operates the four special schools: Tennessee School for the Blind, Tennessee School for the Deaf, West Tennessee School for the Deaf, and Alvin C. York Agricultural Institute. With assistance from the Department of Education, the State Board of Education formulates the policies, standards, and guidelines governing K-12 public education. The department is responsible for implementing these policies, standards, and guidelines. Higher education is governed by two independent systems: the University of Tennessee System and the State University and Community College System, more commonly known as the Tennessee Board of Regents System. The University of Tennessee is a statewide system with three major campuses in Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Martin, and a number of specialized units. The Board of Regents System delivers higher education and vocational training through a network of independent state universities, community colleges, technical institutes, technical community colleges, and technology centers. The Tennessee Higher Education Commission (THEC) provides coordination, communication, policy analysis, and financial recommendations for both systems. The Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation administers student financial aid programs. Improvement Highlights The improvements for Education include recommendations for a K-12 ReadingInitiative and a Higher Education Excellence Initiative intended to address the critical education attainment problem in Tennessee. Information about Tennessee's educational attainment, compared with other states, is provided following Table 3 in a section entitled \"Higher Education Attainment and Comparisons.\" K-12 Education The K-12 Education budget includes improvements grouped into two categories: Reading Initiative and Other K-12 Improvements. Reading Initiative The K-12 Education budget includes $96.7 million for the Reading Initiative that is needed to promote the educational success of Tennessee's children and ensure that every child has the opportunity to succeed in school. The Reading Initiative has six components: Reading Coaches; Early Childhood Education; Catching Up; Teaching Resources - Quality Teaching; Teaching Resources - Digital Enhancement; and Teaching Resources - Classroom Materials. These improvements are summarized in the following pages on Table 1 and in more detail in the \"Improvements for 2001-2002\" section. The Reading Coaches initiative, which provides training programs for teachers and students, is recommended with a state appropriation of $20.2 million. This program will make reading by the end of the third grade a priority and build upon those skills. Also recommended is $16 million for Catching Up, a program to give students a fair chance of passing the Gateway graduation tests. Of this amount, $10 million is targeted for catch-up activities for seventh and eighth students whoTB-82are at risk of failing the Gateway tests, and $6 million is provided to enhance the professional development of middle school math and science teachers who were licensed under old standards. The Early Childhood Education initiative proposed in this budget is the first phase of a five-year plan to offer early childhood education to all four year olds in Tennessee by 2005-2006. Currently 36,850 four-year old children are not served by a pre- school program. In the first phase of this program (2001-2002), an additional 7,370 children will be enrolled in the program. Phase one will serve educationally at-risk children. The Early Childhood Education program is funded in this budget at a first-year cost of $42,350,000 from state appropriations. Fiscal year 2001-2002 funding for the first year of the academic portion of the Early Childhood Education program is $36.1 million. Another element of the Early Childhood Education program is to expand availability of Family Resource Centers. The centers will help identify children at risk of educational failure, increase parent and family involvement in their children's education, and help with the transition into school. The budget includes $5.5 million for 110 additional Family Resource Centers to serve this purpose. For oversight and materials for the Early Childhood Education program, a state appropriation of $300,000 is recommended. An additional $250,000 is provided for an early childhood education institute to provide additional certified teachers; and $200,000 for student entrance screening. Teaching quality is addressed with a $7.6 million improvement. Included in this initiative is $2 million for scholarships targeted to specific subject areas where shortages exist; $4,442,100 for a mentoring program that will help train new teachers; $800,000 for Teaching as a Second Career, a K-12 teacher certification initiative to encourage professionals to earn K-12 teaching certificates in their fields; and $322,500 to encourage teachers to obtain national board certification. Other Teaching Resource initiatives include $5 million for a digital internet serviceto provide Advanced Placement courses to school systems unable to offer these courses at particular schools due to lack of teachers or small numbers of students. An additional $5.6 million is recommended to provide an additional $100 per teacher for classroom materials. Other K-12 Improvements Aside from these Reading Initiatives, the budget includes $19.4 million to maintain full funding of the Basic Education Program (BEP). The final set of the ten Gateway tests is funded with $5.2 million. The tests to be funded for fiscal year 2001-2002 are Physical Science, Chemistry, American History, Algebra 2, and Geometry. An improvement of $5.2 million is included for the English as a Second Language program, because of an increasing number of English-Limited Learner (ELL) students. Other needed improvements include $205,000 for teacher training and experience salary adjustments at the Special Schools; $2,150,000 for the Tennessee Infants and Toddlers program; and $500,000 in state appropriations for an autism center in East Tennessee. A salary increase of 3% effective July 1, 2001, for BEP funded positions is funded in the Miscellaneous Appropriations, listed in the General Government section of the Budget Document. Higher Education The Higher Education budget includes improvements grouped into two categories: Higher Education Excellence Initiative and Other Higher Education Improvements. Higher Education Excellence Initiative In May 1999, the Governor's Council on Excellence in Higher Education issued recommendations for raising the overall standards of higher education in Tennessee.B-83This budget includes a second year of Excellence Initiatives which reflect many of the recommendations of the Council on Excellence, along with funding recommendations of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission (THEC), in consultation with the University of Tennessee and the State Board of Regents. The improvement funding in this budget for the Excellence Initiatives of the Council, THEC, and the two university systems would be the second year of a five-year plan to add $445 million for improvements to Higher Education programs. In fiscal year 2001-2002, this budget provides $92.4 million for the Higher Education Excellence Initiatives. The Excellence Initiatives and other Higher Education improvements are summarized in the following pages on Table 2 (summary) and Table 3 (by institution or program), and are described in more detail below and in the \"Improvements for Fiscal Year 2001-2002\" section following Table 3 and the section titled \"Higher Education Attainment and Comparisons.\" To help public colleges in Tennessee become more competitive, a $10 million state appropriation is recommended for the recruitment and retention of quality faculty in high-demand disciplines. These funds will be matched with $5 million from student tuition and fees, for a total of $15 million to help Tennessee public colleges compete with colleges in other states for outstanding faculty. An improvement of $43.9 million is provided for operating increases. These funds will increase the number of faculty, improve library holdings, improve instructional and laboratory budgets, support technology initiatives, upgrade campus equipment, improve building maintenance, increase graduate student stipends, and address inflation of basic fixed operating costs. An appropriation of $15 million is provided to replace special research and instructional equipment in both university systems. This will be focused on the most critical replacement needs. An amount of $4 million will be used at the East Tennessee College of Medicine; and of the remaining $11 million, the Board of Regents institutions willbe allocated $6.6 million, and the University of Tennessee, $4.4 million. A $12.5 million improvement is recommended to enhance the research initiatives of the major institutions, including $7.5 million for the University of Tennessee and $5 million for the Board of Regents System. The $7.5 million for UT is the second installment of a $30 million appropriation goal to enable UT to double federal research and development grants to $150 million per year and to put UT among the top 25 public research universities by 2008. The $5 million for the Board of Regents System also will require campus matching funds and will allow the research institutions to develop major research activities and attract federal grants in order to elevate the research function, as recommended by the Governor's Council on Excellence. In addition, the Governor's Council on Excellence in Higher Education recommended improvements in student financial aid. To this end, $9 million is included for the Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation (TSAC) to provide funds to serve an additional 6,021 needy students, to increase the maximum award level from $1,746 to $1,938, to offset a 5% tuition and fee increase, and increase the maximum award for the Tennessee Teaching Scholars program from $3,000 to $3,900. Other Higher Education Improvements Apart from the Excellence Initiatives, an appropriation of $10,765,000 is recommended as the first installment to support the Geier desegregation agreement. From the $10,765,000 Geier improvement, the general appropriations bill provides that a sum sufficient from that amount will be available for expenditure in fiscal year 2000-2001, in order to fulfill current-year commitments under the Agreed Order. The balance of the Geier appropriation will be available for expenditure in fiscal year 2001-2002. Also recommended in this budget is funding for an average 3% salary increase for higher education employees, effective July 1, 2001. These funds are included in the Higher Education System-Wide ImprovementsB-84sections of the improvement summary and program statements. Under the THEC higher education funding formula, the appropriate share of the salary increase is funded from state appropriations, and the balance from student tuition and fees. In the academic formula and other tuition-generating units, thesalary increase is funded by state appropriations and student tuition and fees. In other non-formula units, the salary increase is funded entirely with state appropriations. The improvements for Higher Education are outlined in tables 2 and 3 on the following pages.Reading Initiative Reading Coaches 20,173,100 $ Early Childhood Education 42,350,000 Catching Up 16,000,000 Teaching Resources: Quality Teaching 7,564,600 Digital Enhancement 5,000,000 Classroom Materials 5,600,000 Subtotal Reading Initiative 96,687,700 $ Other Improvements Basic Education Program (BEP) 19,422,800 $ Testing 5,229,500 English as a Second Language 5,243,000 Infants and Toddlers 2,150,000 Autism Center 500,000 Other Improvements 479,400 Subtotal Other Improvements 33,024,700 $ Total - K-12 Education 129,712,400$ State Appropriation 129,712,400 K-12 Education Improvement FY 2001-2002Table 1 B-85Excellence Initiatives Faculty Retention and Recruiting* 10,000,000 $ Operating Increase 43,914,000 Other: Student Assistance Awards 9,012,100 Special Equipment 15,000,000 Research Initiatives - University of Tennessee 7,500,000 Research Initiatives - Board of Regents System 5,000,000 Technology Initiative (Debt Service) 2,000,000 Subtotal Excellence Initiatives 92,426,100 $ State Appropriation 92,414,000 Other Revenue 12,100 Other Improvements Geier Settlement (Desegregation) 10,765,000 $ State Appropriation 10,765,000 Total - Higher Education Program Improvement ** 103,191,100$ State Appropriation 103,179,000 Other Revenue 12,100 *Faculty Retention and Recruiting - $10 million state appropriation, to be matched with $5 million from student tuition and fees, for a total of $15 million for faculty retention and recruiting in high-demand disciplines. **The Higher Education budget also includes an improvement to fund an average 3% salary increase for higher education employees.

Less than 18% of Tennesseans 25 and older hold a bachelor's degree, compared to the national average of 25.2% and the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) average of 21.7%. In order to reach the educational attainment level of its border states, Tennessee would have to increase its bachelor's degree holders by 33.9% (204,000 individuals). It should be noted that progress towards this benchmark will take time as Tennessee currently awards approximately 13,700 baccalaureate degrees and enrolls 26,000 first-time freshmen each year. Progress toward increasing educational attainment will involve a long-term commitment to access, retention, and institutional quality. 1990 1995 1999 United States 20.3% of Population 25 or Older with a Bachelor's Degree One important means of improving the educational attainment level of Tennessee's citizens is to encourage more high school graduates to attend college. Approximately 54% of Tennessee high school graduates attended a Tennessee higher education institution in 2000. According to the most recent data available from SREB, Tennessee is ranked 11th in the SREB with respect to this statistic.B-89Funding Considerations According to SREB figures, expenditures for public education in Tennessee as a percentage of state and local spending dropped from 31.2% in 1986 to 30.8% in 1996. In the SREB, the percentage decreased from 35.9% to 33.4%. When adjusting for inflation, state allocated general operating funds per full time equivalent (FTE) student have decreased 24.4% in Tennessee since 1987, while the SREB states experienced only a 4.1% decrease. The end result in Tennessee was a shift in percentage of operating expenses accounted for by state funds. State allocated funds represented 64.4% of higher education's overall operating expenses in Tennessee in 1987 but decreased to 57.8% in 1998. Annual Average State FY for Higher Education (Dollars in Millions) Sources: Tennessee: State Budget Documents, 1995-1996 and 2000-2001; Other States: Illinois State University, Grapevine Database, 2000 Throughout this period of less than adequate funding, Tennessee's students and their families realized a much greater burden through increases in required tuition and fees. From 1993-94 to 2000-01, tuition and fee revenue has increased in Tennessee by 73%, while state appropriations increased only 27%. Although undergraduate tuition and fees have been rising nationally in the last few years, Tennessee is well outpacing the fee increases of its regional peers. For example, tuition and fees at the University of Tennessee Knoxville have risen 43% since 1995-96 compared with an increase of 14.7% for peer schools. This trend is troubling because it creates a fiscal obstacle to college participation. Tuition and fees at Tennessee's four-year schools require 7.7% of the state's median household income, a figure that is above the SREB average. This demand on family income is especially burdensome to the citizens in Tennessee's poorest counties.B-90Median Income 1998 4 year 2 year 4 year 2 year SREB Survey (CPS) 1998 (States), and CPS 1995 (Counties)Relationship of Tuition and Fees to Median Income Average Fees % of Income As tuition and fees have increased, Tennessee has fallen farther behind its peers with respect to the level of financial aid offered to its citizens. The last several years have produced sizeable increases across the country in the availability of state level student aid. From 1992-93 to 1998-99, Tennessee experienced a 43% increase in total aid from state allocations. Nationally, states have appropriated 64% more aid dollars over that same period of time. Excluding Georgia because of the Hope scholarship, from the analysis, the SREB states have well outpaced Tennessee by increasing aid to need and merit programs by 135%. Tennessee distributes slightly under $4 per resident in financial aid compared with the national per-resident average of $11. Not only is Tennessee's current commitment to financial aid well off the pace of our neighboring states and the country at large, but the rate of increase in those same states will make it increasingly difficult to catch up.

Across all four- year institutions, professors in Tennessee were 10.5% below the SREB average in 1999-2000, compared with 0.5% above the average in 1991-92, while assistant professors were 8.1% below the SREB average in 1999-2000, compared to 1% above in 1991-92. In fiscal year 1991-92, the average faculty salary at public four-year institutions in Tennessee was 3.4% higher than the SREB average. In fiscal year 1999-B-912000, the average faculty salary at public four-year institutions in Tennessee had dropped to 6.2% below the SREB average. When adjusting for inflation (1991 constant dollars), faculty actually earn $11,000 less than they did in 1991. The following chart details the movement of faculty salaries (all ranks) from 1991-1992 6.2% belowFaculty Salary ComparisonB-92The following graph depicts the manner in which funds are divided among the departments within this group.

This goal is to be accomplished by having a trained reading coach in every K-8 school. This coach will receive intensive reading training from a partnership between the department and higher education institutions. The training relationship will be maintained and continuously enhanced through the state's internet infrastructure. The coach will provide this training to every teacher in the school. The coach also will work with the community to train volunteers to assist in accomplishing the department's reading goals. The bulk of the funding is for reading materials and supplies. In addition, the reading coach will receive a supplement to the teaching salary for assuming these additional duties. $20,173,100 $0 0 $20,173,100 $0 $20,173,100 $0 Sub-total Reading Initiative - Early Childhood Education To provide funding for the first phase of an early childhood education program serving Tennessee's four year old children. The first phase is directed toward educationally at-risk children. This program is an essential component for school success. Four year old children will attain the cognitive, social, emotional, and physical development skills needed to begin school. The first phase will serve an additional 7,370 four year old children. The goal of the Administration is to offer early childhood education to all four year olds by the 2005-2006 school year. Currently, 36,850 four year olds are not served by a pre-school program. This initiative includes $36.1 million in state appropriations to cover phase 1 of the academic initiative. Also included in the initiative is $5.5 million for an additional 110 Family Resource Centers, which will allow funding for a minimum of one center per county. These centers will help identify those children at greatest risk of educational failure, increase parent and family involvement in their children's education, and transition children and families into school. This initiative also includes $300,000 for materials and staff to monitor the programs, $250,000 for a teacher training and recertification institute, and $200,000 for student entrance screening. $42,350,000 $42,350,000 $0 Sub-total Reading Initiative - Catching Up To provide funding to give all students a fair chance to pass the Gateway graduation tests. Student achievement on the current high school competency test and on the seventh and eighth grade Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program (TCAP) tests indicates that a substantial number of students are at risk of failing the much more difficult Gateway tests set to begin in school year 2001- 2002. This will provide $10 million for targeted catch-up activities for seventh and eighth grade students at risk of failing the Gateway tests. In addition, this improvement includes $6 million for intensive professional development in math and science for middle grade teachers who were licensed under old standards. $16,000,000 $0 0 $16,000,000 $0 Sub-total B-94State Federal Other Positions TotalEducation Improvements for Fiscal Year 2001-2002 Reading Initiative - Teaching Resources - Quality Teaching To provide funding to address K-12 teacher recruitment and retention.

The Health and Social Services functional area is composed of the following commissions, departments, and agencies : Commission on Children and Youth Commission on Aging Health Facilities Commission Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges Department of Finance and Administration - TennCare Program Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Department of Finance and Administration - Mental Retardation Department of Health Department of Human Services Department of Children's Services. A major responsibility of this functional group is the administration of programs for children that have been placed in the state's custody. These programs range from the provision of a structured environment for our troubled youth to a safe home setting for foster care children. Services for children in state care are based on professional assessments of each child. This functional group is also charged with ensuring quality treatment and habilitation services to the mentally ill and mentally retarded citizens of Tennessee. This includes institutional and community programs for the mentally ill and the developmentally disabled. In addition to programs for special-needs citizens, general health care services are provided through local and regional health care facilities. These programs range from immunization of our school children to ensuring quality care for the elderly. Health care programs for the Medicaid eligible, uninsured, and uninsurable popula- tions are also the responsibility of thisfunctional group. These services are provided by TennCare, a comprehensive health care delivery system. TennCare offers a standard benefit package through a managed care approach resulting in more cost-effective coverage for a greater number of people. The TennCare Partners program provides mental health and substance abuse services for TennCare enrollees. Thes e agencies are also charged with helping disadvantaged Tennesseans achieve or maintain self-sufficiency. Other assistance programs include food coupons to qualified applicants, protective services to abused and neglected children, and legal services to establish, enforce, and administer child support obligations for citizens. Families First, a time-limited assistance program that emphasizes job skills development, is fully funded in this budget. Support services, such as day care and transportation, are also provided to recipients. This is a temporary assistance program with lifetime eligibility limitations. Improvement Highlights Commission on Children and Youth The budget includes an additional $120,000 for the Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) program, in order to recruit, train, and supervise volunteers to serve as advocates for children in state custody who are primarily abused, neglected or dependent. Commission on Aging The recommended budget includes $2.5 million of state appropriations and $2.7 million from new federal funds to enhance the home and community based services system for elderly and disabled persons who do not qualify for services under Medicaid. This will increase the package of services and will delay or prevent additional persons from entering a nursing home. The federal funds are for aTB-146family caregiver support services program that provides information and referral, respite services, personal care, and other home and community based services to families and individuals caring for aging and disabled persons. The required $531,600 in state matching funds is included in the $2.5 million state appropriation. TennCare Program Included in the recommended budget is an additional $459.3 million, including state matching funds of $160.4 million, to fund improvements to the TennCare program. The budget funds rate increases for providers costing $208 million, with $71.6 million from state appropriation. These rate increases include a four percent capitation rate increase for the Managed Care Organizations, an eight percent increase for Behavioral Health Organizations, a 16.5% pharmacy inflation increase, and payments to Federally Qualified Health Clinics participating in the TennCare program. The budget includes $79.5 million recurring funds, which includes $26.2 million state appropriations, to provide for increased enrollment.

Judicial power is vested in the various levels of courts which compose the state's court system. The court system can be grouped into the following functional areas: The Supreme Court Intermediate Appellate Courts Trial Courts Courts of limited jurisdiction Court services and support. The Supreme Court, the highest court in the state, is composed of five justices , each elected to an eight-year term. The workload of the court consists of cases appealed from lower courts. Cases may be further appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court only on grounds of federal constitutionality. Supreme Court decisions act to resolve controversies arising out of Tennessee law and to establish guidelines for the lower courts to use in future decisions. The Intermediate Appellate Courts are composed of the Court of Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals. The Court of Appeals hears appeals only in civil cases from the lower courts. The Court of Criminal Appeals has jurisdiction to hear most felony and misdemeanor appeals from general trial courts as well as post-conviction petitions. The state's trial courts include Chancery, Criminal, Circuit and Probate Courts. Chancery Courts are the traditional equity courts used when common law and/or statutory law proves in adequate for cases. Circuit Courts, which sometimes overlap with the Chancery Courts, have jurisdiction to hear civil and criminal cases. Criminal Courts have jurisdiction over criminal cases and hearing misdemeanor appeals from lower courts. Probate Courts primarily have jurisdiction over probate of wills and administration of estates.

Jurisdiction of General Sessions Courts vary from county to county based on state laws and private acts; they hear civil, criminal, and juvenile cases, except in counties where the legislature has established separate Juvenile Courts.

That tradition continues today as the department helps expand markets for farm and forest products through promotions and industry development activities. TDA provides an array of valuable consumer services from food safety and product quality assurance to pesticide regulation and environmental monitoring. Forestry services include landowner assistance, wildfire suppression and state forests management. Water quality programs encourage and promote wise stewardship of our natural resources. The department's mission is fulfilled within the four major areas: Administration and Grants Market Development Regulatory Services Forestry. Administration and Grants Administration coordinates various duties including policy and strategic planning, budgeting, personnel administration, legal, and information services. The division also monitors grant-based programs in the areas of soil conservation and water quality, pesticide pollution and abatement, commodity distribution assistance to eligible recipients, forestry incentives, and volunteer fire department assistance. Overseeing the distribution of donated surplus USDA food is also an important function in this area. The department cooperates with the National Agricultural Statistics Service to collect, analyze, and publish reliable data for producers and decision makers in agriculture. TDA administers programs to help reduce soil erosion on Tennessee farm and forestlands and to improve water quality. Through the Agricultural Resources Conservation Fund, cost-share grants are provided to farmers and other landowners that install best management practices to achieve these results. The Tennessee Grain Indemnity Fund protects grain producers against the financial failure of a commodity dealer or warehouseman. The program is funded from interest income and grain producers' self-imposed assessments. Funds deposited in the Certified Cotton Growers Organizational Fund are used for the Boll Weevil Eradication Program. The purpose of this program is to destroy, suppress, and eradicate boll weevils. Administration also provides staff support and data management services for the Tennessee Tobacco Farmers Certifying Board.
