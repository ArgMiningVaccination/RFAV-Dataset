This year, with the persistence of the novel Coronavirus, it's more important than ever to make sure that your immune system is at its peak. Colorado Recovery Infusion Center can help aid in your immunity to help your body's response to COVID-19, as well as illnesses that spread during this time of year. Creating the best healthy life you can requires a holistic approach. Whether you're stressed about the holidays, work, family, or the current state of the world, our registered nurses can help you find the right regimen for your body. Whether it's IV Infusions, Nutritional Supplements, or focusing on reducing stress and improving your diet, help is out there. Your body is amazing in its ability to fight bacteria and viruses. However, when your immune system is vulnerable, you're experiencing adrenal fatigue, poor nutrients, lack of sleep, or chronic stress, your body can have a harder time-fighting disease. There are many essential nutrients that our bodies just cannot make on their own. However, with a blend of specialized vitamins and nutrients, you can increase your immune system's resilience and effectiveness in fighting off viruses. IV Infusions IV infusions are the highest form of bioavailability. When vitamins and minerals are infused intravenously, the bioavailability is 100%. This means that your body is receiving all the benefits from the infusion. Preventing an illness is often easier than treating one. That's why our [Vitamin C Infusion](https://coloradoivtherapy.com/vitamin-c-iv/) and [Immune Booster Infusion](https://coloradoivtherapy.com/immune-booster/) are essential in both boosting and maintaining health and immunity. IV fluids, vitamins, and antioxidants cleanse your body and supercharge your immune system to fight off illness. Vitamin C Infusion Vitamin C infusions are very popular, safe, and best studied. Vitamin C, also known as L-ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin that is necessary for the biosynthesis of collagen, L-carnitine, and certain neurotransmitters. Collagen is an important element of connective tissue and is essential for wound healing. Overall, it has been proven that Vitamin C has the capacity to protect against damage caused by free radicals, boost the immune system's effect on wound healing and infections, and even prevent and delay the spread of certain types of cancer cells. It is necessary for all individuals to have sufficient levels of vitamin C in order to prevent illness. There is evidence that such infusions are beneficial in cancer patients, reducing the effects on tumor size and increasing the time to relapse. Patients with infections, shingles, and chronic fatigue also benefit greatly from these infusions. Vitamin C infusions are overall important for: - Enhancing the efficiency of the immune system - Reducing excessive inflammation - Relieving fatigue and exhaustion - Restoring tissue - Improving mood - Strengthening resistance to cancerous cells Immune Booster Infusion For anyone feeling a little run down, this infusion restores our body's vitamins and minerals so your body is better equipped to fight off illness, decrease the severity of illness and duration of illness. Deficiencies in various vitamins and minerals can make you more vulnerable to several illnesses. These can include: - Chronic inflammation - Respiratory illnesses - Viruses and infections - HIV and Hepatitis C - COVID-19 - Heart muscle disease - Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease Our Immune Booster Infusion is packed with Vitamin C, B5, B6, B12, Magnesium, Zinc, Lysine, Glutathione, and Selenium. These nutrients are vital components to aid your immune system. With IV infusions, your immune system gets a jumpstart of nutrients without losing any of them as they break down in your body. Nutritional Supplements Dietary supplements are wildly popular. It is estimated by [Harvard Medical School](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/supplements-a-scorecard) that roughly 114 million Americans take at least one supplement a day. However, while the public has a desire for good health, the supplement industry has a desire for high sales. It's important to know what to look for when taking nutritional supplements. As described in this study done by [Harvard Medical School](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/supplements-a-scorecard), the dietary Supplement Health and Education Act has sharply restricted the FDA's ability to regulate products that are marked as \"dietary supplements\". Since 1994, the FDA has had little ability to monitor manufacturers, allowing them to sell these products without submitting evidence of their purity, potency, safety, or efficacy. There is tons of misinformation when it comes to vitamin supplements. Many vitamin C supplements on the market, for example, are synthesized from genetically modified corn and processed with harmful chemicals. There are many studies that claim that these GMOs can lead to and aggravate cancer, proving high doses of synthetic vitamin C damaging. At Colorado Recovery Infusion Center, we source our vitamins from an industry leader in quality, professional-grade supplements, [XYMOGEN.](https://www.xymogen.com/) Their formulas are distributed only to licensed healthcare practitioners and are not sold to, or relabeled for, health-food retail stores. Vitamin D Nutritional Supplement Along with Vitamin C, Vitamin D is so important for our bodies. Vitamin D is produced in the skin and requires lots and lots of sunshine. However, as society has shifted to working in offices at desks, 70% of Americans lack sufficient amounts of Vitamin D. Vitamin D has many benefits for our bodies. Vitamin D is important for bone health, as it is necessary for your body to absorb calcium from the intestines. Vitamin D also reduces the risk of various neuromuscular problems, including falling, prostate cancer, and even malignancies and other autoimmune diseases. The mass majority of Americans are greatly deficient in Vitamin D levels, a vitamin that is very important to maintaining overall health. There is also growing evidence that [Vitamin D is beneficial in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19](https://www.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/HealthU/2020/11/03/should-you-take-vitamin-d-for-covid-prevention/). Studies show that COVID-19 patients who are deficient in vitamin D are more likely to experience serious illness and complications, and more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit. On the other hand, hospitalized COVID-19 patients who took oral vitamin D supplements as part of their treatment were significantly less likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit.
