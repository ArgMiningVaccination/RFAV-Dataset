Called your immune system, this area of your health is on everyone's mind around the world as the global population battles dangerous COVID-19. At [Alternative Disc Therapy](/about/), Dr. Warren Bleiweiss and our team have been educating our patients on the importance of a well-functioning immune system for a number of years and more so since the pandemic outbreak. Now more than ever, the health of your immune system is paramount. Your immune system Your immune system isn't one single organ, but a complex network of organs, cells, and tissues that work together to protect your body from outside invaders, which include: - Bacteria - Viruses - Fungi - Parasites - Toxins Your immune system is constantly adapting and changing as it encounters new invaders, creating protective antibodies along the way. Your immune system is also weakened by smoking, excess drinking, poor nutrition and bad diet, lack of sleep and exercise, stress, anxiety and grief, low in vitamins D and C, grief, lack of light exposure outside and yes too much screen time. Vitamins and your immune health Under ideal conditions, your body receives the vitamins and nutrients it needs to support all areas of your health, from your heart health to the health of your immune system. Unfortunately, the bulk of our diets these days often contain processed foods that are calorie-rich, but nutrient-poor, which can deprive our bodies of the tools it needs for optimal health. More specifically, your immune system relies on several key vitamins, including: - Vitamin C, which is a powerful antioxidant that strengthens your defenses - Vitamin B6, which supports favorable biochemical reactions in your immune system - Vitamin E, which is another antioxidant - Vitamin D, which helps fight inflammation This last vitamin \u2014 D \u2014 is making headlines for its role in COVID-19. One [study](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/advance-article/doi/10.1210/clinem/dgaa733/5934827) found that more than 80% of those who were infected by COVID-19 showed a deficiency in vitamin D. More studies have confirmed that, which has even prompted England [to offer free vitamin D supplements](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55108613) to 2.5 million people. To keep your immune system strong, it is extremely important to stay on a nutrient rich diet including enough fiber, take good quality supplements, and move the body. You don't even have to do a formal exercise each day but just move regularly. In addition, get adequate amount of sunlight exposure and limit exposure to blue light especially in evenings and that includes screen time. If you stay up watching a movie late at night once in a while, wear blue light blocking glasses which are widely available but don't make a habit of staying up late. Optimizing sleep is one of the most effective ways to improve your immune system. Boosting your immune health In addition to taking care of yourself at home to enhance your immune system, you can also benefit from many immune boosting treatments from medical clinics. Now let's take a look at some of the treatments we offer to help boost this all-important system. We offer a number of infusions treatments at our clinic to help your body protect itself. While vitamins are important for strengthening your immune system, we also believe in going a step further by helping your body clear out damaged cells and pathogens to make room for healthier cell growth, which we accomplish in several ways: IV ozone infusion or major ozone immunotherapy With this infusion, we draw some of your own blood, mix in an equal amount of oxygen ozone and then re-inject the mixture into your bloodstream where it goes to work to: - Kill pathogens like viruses and bacteria - Stimulate immunity - Improve circulation and oxygen delivery - Offset oxidative stress - Encourage cellular regeneration While there are many more benefits to oxygen ozone therapy, these give you a good idea about the power of this therapy. VSEL infusions This regenerative therapy is designed to strengthen your immune system by increasing the telomere length of the DNA in your immune cells. It uses your own body's regenerative mechanism to optimize your immune cells. This treatment also removes damages cells, oxygenating tissues and supercharge your antioxidant system. We are one of a small number of clinics in the country that offer this treatment due to the fact that it is highly technical. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) infusions NAD is a coenzyme that plays a critical role in your cellular health and it is involved in millions of metabolic processes. NAD+ levels decline with age. As we age and our levels are low, these infusions are important for promoting optimal cell function in every area, including your all-important immune system. Glutathione This antioxidant is a powerful detoxifying agent that removes toxin from your liver, kidneys, and adrenal glands. It's called a master detoxifier for a good reason. Glutathione helps clear toxins from your body so that your immune system can do its job properly and also slows the progression of many serious diseases. Glutathione has many important functions, including: - Building DNA, the building blocks of proteins and cells - Maintenance of mitochondrial function - Antiviral defense - Regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis - Supporting immune function - Breaking down free radicals - Assisting gallbladder and liver to deal with fats - Improving insulin sensitivity Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) This antioxidant protects your immune cells against damage. ALA serves vital functions at the cellular level, such as energy production. In addition, ALA may have positive benefits for individuals with type 2 diabetes. Studies suggest that ALA may enhance the body's ability to use its own insulin to lower blood sugar. As you can see, these immune-optimizing therapies cover all of your bases allowing you to ward off disease or slow down existing disease. All of our treatments are tailored to each individual patient's specific needs and no one-size-fits-all approach correspond to our philosophy.
