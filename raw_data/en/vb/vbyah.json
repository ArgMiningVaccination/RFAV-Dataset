HUMAN SERVICES Public Health Service Indian Health Service Rockville, MD 20857 I present the Indian Health Service (IHS) Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 Congressional Justification. The FY 2023 budget proposes the first-ever mandatory budget for the IHS. This is a historic step forward in securing stable and predictable funding to improve the overall health status of American Indians and Alaska Natives. 1n FY 2023, the budget includes a total of $9.3 billion in mandatory funding for the IHS, which is $2.5 billion above FY 2022 enacted. This mandatory budget proposal culminates in a total funding level of approximately $36. 7 billion in FY 2032. When compared with the FY 2022 enacted level of $6.8 billion, the FY 2032 proposed funding level represents an increase of close to +$30 billion or +442 percent. 1n addition, our FY 2023 budget submission maintains focus on the IHS mission to raise the physical, mental, social, and spiritual health of American Indians and Alaska Natives to the highest level and support for three main goals that are outlined in our strategic plan: Goal 1: To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people. Goal 2: To promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally perfonning organization. Goal 3 To strengthen UIS program management and operations. The Indian health system faces challenges related to access, quality, management, and operations. This budget, which is aligned with our strategic plan, aims to address these challenges and builds on the progress that we have already made to date. I am excited about what we will achieve together to improve the health and well-being of American Indians and Alaska Natives. The bold action in the FY 2023 President's Budget demonstrates the Administration's continued commitment to work to raise the physical, mental, social and spiritual health of American Indians and Alaska Natives to the highest level and strengthen the Nation-to-Nation relationship. a.. u.A__ Elizabeth A Fowler Acting Director April 25, 2022Organizational Chart i DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN

.............................16 INTRODUCTION AND MISSION Indian Health Service The Indian Health Service (IHS), an Agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the principal Federal Agency charged with the mission of raising the physical, mental, social, and spiritual health of American Indians and Alaska Natives to the highest level. The IHS provides comprehensive primary health care and disease prevention services to approximately 2.7 million American Indians and Alaska Natives through a network of over 600 hospitals, clinics, and health stations on or near Indian reservations. Facilities are predominantly located in rural primary care settings and are managed by IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian health programs. United States Government and Indian Nations The provision of federal health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives is based on a special relationship between Indian Tribes and the United States. The Indian Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, as well as numerous treaties and court decisions, have affirmed this special relationship and the plenary power of Congress to create statutes that benefit Indian people. Principal among these statutes is the Snyder Act of 1921, which provides the basic authority for health servic es provided by the Federal Government to American Indians and Alaska Natives. Indian Health Service and Its Partnership with Tribes In the 1970s, federal Indian policy was re-evaluated leading to adoption of a policy of Indian self- determination. This policy promotes Tribal administration of Federal Indian programs, including health care. Self-Determination does not lessen any federal obligation, but provides an opportunity for Tribes to assume the responsibility of providing health care for their members. IHS partners with Tribes on health care delivery in the context of regular Tribal consultation. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 (ISDEAA), as amended, and the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976 (IHCIA), as amended, provided new opportunities for the IHS and Tribes to deliver quality and accessible health care. The IHCIA includes specific authorizations such as improvements for urban Indian health programs, Indian health professions programs, and the authority to collect from Medicare and Medicaid and other third -party insurers for services rendered at IHS or Tribal facilities. Under the ISDEAA, many Tribes have assumed the administrative and programmatic roles previously carried out by the Federal Government. Tribes currently administer over half of IHS resources through ISDEAA contracts and compacts. The IHS directly administers the remaining resources and manages programs where Tribes have chosen not to contract or compact health programs. CJ - 1INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE FY 2023 Budget Submission to Congress Overview of Budget The fiscal year (FY) 2023 Indian Health Service (IHS) budget encom passes the overall goals of: 1)ensuring comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian/Alaska Native ( AI/AN ) people; 2) promoting excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an opti mally performing organization; and 3) strengthening IHS program management and operations in carrying out the agency mission to raise the physical, mental, social, and spiritual health of AI/ANs to the highest level. The budget conveys the President's comm itment to provide high -quality health care services for AI/ANs. The budget reflects the importance of providing health care, consistent with statutory authorities, to AI/ANs. This budget also fully supports the IHS Strategic Plan 2019 - 2023. In addition, the budget supports the HHS Secretary's priorities to advance health equity and address pressing public health issues such as HIV/Hepatitis C, the opioid epidemic , and maternal mortality. The IHS provides a wide range of clinical, public health, community , and facilities infrastructure services to approximately 2.7 million AI/ANs who are members of 574 federally recognized tribes in 37 states. Comprehensive primary health care and disease prevention services are provided through a network of over 600 hospi tals, clinics, and health stations on or near Indian reservations. These facilities are predominately primary care settings and are managed by IHS, tribal, and urban (I/T/U) Indian health programs. The IHS meets the annual statutory requirement to consult with and solicit the participation of Tribes and tribal organizations in the development of the budget for IHS. Likewise, IHS confers with urban Indian organizations. The consultation and confer input informs the IHS budget formulation process. The core of the agency's formulation process consists of the priorities and recommendations developed in consultation with Tribes through this independent annual budget process led by the National Tribal Budget Formulation Workgroup. IHS is strongly committed to th is process and it ensures that the IHS budget is relevant to the health needs and priorities of AI/ANs. The tribal priorities identified in the consultation process are also instrumental to inform senior officials of other U.S. Department of Health and Hum an Services (HHS) agencies of the health needs of the AI/AN population, so that they have the opportunity to reflect those priorities in the Department's budget requests. The tribal budget consultation process is a key component of the IHS strategic object ives to build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships (Objective 1.2); improve communication within the organization, with Tribes, Urban Indian Organizations, and other stakeholders, and with the general public (Objective 3.1); and secure and effectively manage the assets and resources (Objective 3.2); objectives that advance the IHS mission. Summary of Budget Submission In line with the long -standing recommendations of Tribal leaders, the FY 2023 President's Budget proposes the first -ever ful l mandatory budget for the IHS. The FY 2023 budget is a historic step forward towards the goal of securing stable and predictable funding to improve the overall health status of AI/ANs , and ensuring that the disproportionate impacts experienced by tribal c ommunities during the COVID -19 pandemic are never repeated. CJ - 2The bold action taken in the FY 2023 President's Budget demonstrates the Administration's continued commitment to honor the United States' treaty responsibility to tribal nations and strengthen th e nation - to-nation relationship. The budget significantly increases IHS's funding over 10 years, makes all funding mandatory, and exempts all proposed law funding from sequestration. The Indian health system is chronically underfunded compared to other hea lthcare systems in the U.S. Despite substantial growth in the IHS discretionary budget over the last decade, by 57 percent from FY 2012 to the current FY 2022 Enacted level , the growth has not been sufficient to address the well documented funding gaps in Indian Country. Growth beyond what can be accomplished through discretionary spending is necessary to address funding gaps and remediate health disparities. Mandatory spending is a more appropriate avenue to provide high -quality health care that is reli able and widely available to A I/ANs , addressing health disparities. Historical trauma and chronic underinvestment significantly contributed to the perpetuation of health disparities in Indian Country. A I/ANs born today have a life expectancy that is 5.5 ye ars fewer than the U.S. all -races population, with some tribes experiencing life expectancy as much as 12 years fewer than the general population. AI/ANs also experience disproportionate rates of mortality from most major health issues, including chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, diabetes, unintentional injuries, assault and homicide, and suicide. The COVID -19 pandemic compounded the impact of these disparities in tribal communities, with AI/ANs experiencing disproportionate rates of COVID -19 infection, hospitalization, and death. Underfunding of direct health care services in tribal communities, aging infrastructure, high vacancy rates, and other systemic issues significantly contributed to these stark inequities. The COVID -19 experience in Indian Count ry illustrates the urgent need for large -scale investments to improve the overall health status of AI/ANs , and ensure that the disproportionate impacts experienced during the pandemic are never repeated. Mandatory funding provides a long -term solution for adequate, stable, and predictable funding for the Indian health system. The challenges of an annual discretionary budget are well documented by the Government Accountability Office in their report GAO -18-652, Indian Health Service: Considerations Related t o Providing Advance Appropriation Authority. While providing advance appropriations for IHS would resolve some of the challenges presented by annual discretionary funding like the instability caused by continuing resolutions and lapses in appropriations, it would not address issues of adequacy or predictability in funding. Adequacy and predictability in funding would support enhanced recruitment and retention of health professionals and would enable health programs to more effectively complete longer - term planning activities over multiple years. These changes will have a direct positive impact on the availability and delivery of quality health care. Mandatory funding for the IHS provides the opportunity for significant funding increases that could not be achieved under discretionary funding caps. Further, this mandatory and legislative funding proposal would authorize and appropriate funding over 10 years, through FY 2032, ensuring predictability that would allow IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian health program s the opportunity for long -term and strategic planning. The budget also exempts IHS from proposed law sequestration, which is the legislatively mandated process of budget control consisting of automatic, across -the-board spending reductions to enforce budg et targets to limit federal spending. Exempting the IHS budget from sequestration ensures funding for direct health care services to A I/ANs is not reduced, consistent with the treatment of other critical programs such as veterans' benefits and nutrition as sistance programs. The budget also includes inflation factors to CJ - 3address the growing cost of providing direct health care services, including pay costs, medical and non - medical inflation, and population growth. While this is a historic first step, the IHS recognizes that we must continue to work in consul tation with Tribes and confer with Urban Indian Organizations , and with our partners in Congress, to ensure the budget is structured and implemented correctly with the resources identified over the next 10 years. FY 2023 President's Budget For the first year of the proposal, the budget includes $9. 3 billion in mandatory funding, which includes $9.1 billion in proposed law funding and $147 million in current law funding for the Special Diabetes Program for Indians. This is an increase of $2.5 billion above the FY 2022 Enacted level . Crosscutting changes from the FY 2022 Enacted level include : Current Services : +$207 million to offset the rising cost of providing direct health care services, including tribal and federal pay costs ($96 million), medical and non -medical inflation ($24 million), and population growth ($87 million). These resources will help the IHS to ma intain services at the FY 202 2 levels by shoring up base operating budgets of IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian health programs in the face of increasing costs. Staffing and Operating Costs for Newly -Constructed Health Care Facilities : +$102 million for staffing of eight newly -constructed health care facilities. These funds support the staffing packages for new or expanded facilities, which will expand the availability of direct health care services in areas where existing health care capacity is overextended. Indian Health Services account changes from the FY 2022 Enacted level include: Indian Health Care Improvement Fund : +$243 million to provide additional health services and address resource disparities across the Indian health system. The budget also proposes to realign funding for the Indian Health Care Improvement fund into the Hospitals and Health Clinics funding line, consistent with how this program was historically funded. This shift reduces administrative burden. Partially Sustai n American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) Investments : +$220 million to partially sustain the ARPA investments that were provided to expand access to mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services, and to expand the public health workforce in Indian Country. ARP A funds were provided on a one -time basis. The additional resources included in the budget prevent a sharp reduction in services as one -time ARP funds are exhausted. Hospitals and Health Clinics General Increase : +$215 million to expand access to direct health care services by providing an estimated 41 thousand inpatient admissions and almost 16 million outpatient visits at IHS and Tribal facilities . These resources will support efforts to reduce health disparities and improve the overall health status for AI/ANs by increasing the availability of health care services in Indian Country. Purchased and Referred Care : +$206 million to support additional contract health care services that are not available in IHS or Tribal health facilities, providing an estimated 7,333 additional inpatient admissions ; 182,319 additional outpatient visits ; and 8,006 additional patient travel CJ - 4trips. These funds would also support establishment of a statewide Purchased/Referred Care Designatio n Area (PRCDA) for the state of Arizona and will support the feasibility studies for the statewide PRCDA expansion in North and South Dakota , as directed in the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Electronic Health Record : +$140 million to improve the quality of health care in Indian Country and health status of AI/ANs by modernizing the IHS Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. These resources will support efforts to stabilize the aging IHS EHR while modernization is underway, and supp ort the initial build activities for the EHR environment, as well as initial site transition planning. Addressing Targeted Public Health Challenges : +$60 million to make targeted investments in IHS as part of HHS initiatives to address our Nation's most p ressing public health challenges, which disproportionately impact American Indian and Alaska Native communities. This includes HIV and Hepatitis C (+$47 million), improving maternal health (+$4 million), and addressing opioid use (+$9 million). Dental Health : +$48 million to expand access to dental health services in American Indian and Alaska Native communities by supporting an estimated 1 million dental visits in FY 2023 . Assessments : +$27 million to offset the increasing costs of central assessments charged to the IHS by HHS since FY 2014. To address the growing costs of shared services at HHS, the IHS has delayed hiring and investments in critical systems, working to shield direct h ealth care services to the maximum extent possible. However, the IHS is at a point where it can no longer sacrifice oversight and management of national health programs to absorb these rising costs. Urban Indian Health : +$27 million to increase funding fo r urban Indian health programs to provide additional culturally competent direct health care services for AI/ANs living in urban areas. This investment will provide an estimated 1.1 million health care, outreach, and referral services to urban Indian users in FY 2023. The budget also proposes to realign funding for former National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) programs from the Alcohol & Substance Abuse line into the Urban Health line. This shift reduces administrative burden. National Community Health Aide Program (CHAP) : +$20 million to support the expansion of CHAP to the lower 48 states. These additional resources would support the training, certifying, and hiring of health aides, as well as national program management activities. Indian Health Professions : +$20 million to offer additional IHS Scholarship and Loan Repayment awards, bolstering recruitment and retention efforts through these two high demand programs , and through other strategies . Emergency Medical Services : +$20 milli on to address critical needs for Emergency Medical Services in Indian Country, where stagnating funding creates difficulties in maintaining equipment, retaining staff, and other challenges. Direct Operations : +$18 million to support the efficient and effe ctive administration and oversight of national and Area -level functions like financial management, human resources, CJ - 5grants management, acquisitions, I ndian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act contracting and compacting administration, contract support costs and tribal lease payments administration, performance management, compliance, and other administrative supports and systems. Emergency Preparedness : +$10 million for emergency preparedness activities at IHS Headquarters and Area offices to establish a dedicated emergency preparedness workforce at IHS and support relevant training and capacity building efforts. Division of Telehealth : +$10 million to appropriately manage and oversee a comprehensive telehealth program at the IHS that would expand telehealth services, develop governance structures, provide training to users, and integrate with clinical services. Office of Quality : +$10 million to support activities that ensure high quality service provision and that CMS accreditation standar ds are met including a mock survey program, gap analyses for at - risk facilities, quality measures and reporting enhancements, training on medical quality issues, and expanded risk management activities. Office of Health Information Technology : +$9 million to support new FTE and existing salary costs. Funding for the Office of Information Technology has remained stagnant for the last 10 years, and pay costs and tribal shares have impacted the ability of this critical program to support its full salary cost and hire the staff necessary to ensure appropriate operations at the Agency. Cancer Initiative : +$8 million to develop a coordinated public health and clinical cancer prevention initiative to implement best practices and prevention strategies to address i ncidence of cancer and mortality among AI/ANs. Division of Graduate Medical Education : +$4 million to expand and support Graduate Medical Education programs to create a pipeline for future physicians to address longstanding vacancy issues at IHS. Nationa l Business Improvement Center : +$3 million to establish a new program to ensure proper monitoring and management of the revenue cycle and purchase of care, ensure compliance with internal controls to maximize revenue at the national level, and quickly iden tify threats to the revenue cycle and proactively assist Areas/facilities to mitigate adverse outcomes. Community Health Representatives Program Evaluation : +$3 million for a national evaluation of the Community Health Representatives program. Tribal M anagement Grants : +$2 million for an additional 15 -20 awards to Tribes to access their capacity to directly operate health care services currently provided by the IHS. Nurse Preceptorship : +$1 million to create a new program to provide training, developme nt, mentoring, and other on -the-job supports to improve placement rates of first year nurses in IHS and Tribal Health Programs. CJ - 6 New Tribes : +$1 million to support new federally recognized Tribes. Self-Governance : +$140,000 for a general program increase to expand Self -Governance programs. Immunization Alaska : +$2,600 for a general program increase to expand the Immunizations in Alaska program. Indian Health Facilities account changes from the FY 2022 Enacted level include: Health Care Facilities Construction : +$2 86 million to support the remaining projects on the 1993 IHS Health Care Facilities Construction Priority List , and to construc t additional staff quarters, small ambulatory facilities , and new demonstration projects to fund mid-sized ambul atory health care facilities projects . Maintenance and Improvement : +$172 million for major projects to reduce the Backlog of Essential Maintenance . Alteration, and Repair (BEMAR), as well as routine maintenance and repair to sustain the condition of federal and Tribal healthcare facilities, and environmental compliance projects to meet changing healthcare delivery needs. Equipment : +$71 million for maintenance and upgrades to existing medical equipment, and procurement of new medical equipment to rep lace units that are at the end of their useable lifecycle at IHS and Tribal healthcare facilities. Facilities and Environmental Health Support : +$67 million for Facilities and Environment Health Support, including 1) +$49 million for additional Infrastruc ture Investment and Jobs Act program support activities and 2) +$18 million for a new program to recruit and retain new public health engineers by partnering with colleges and universities to implement a scholarship program with service requirements in support of Sanitation Facilities Construction projects across Indian Country . FY 2023 Contract Support Costs and Section 105 (l) Lease Agreements : The budget includes a mandatory indefinite appropriation for Contract Support C osts and Section 105 (l) lease agreements with estimated funding level s of $1.1 billion for Contract Support Costs (+$262 million above the FY 2022 Enacted level) and $150 million for Section 105 (l) Lease Agreements (same as the FY 2022 Enacted level) . Special Diabetes Program for Indians: The budget includes $1 47 million for the Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI) , which reflects current law (P.L. 116 -260) and includes a mandatory sequester of 2 percent . FY 2024 - FY 2032 President's Budget This mandatory budget proposal culminates in a total funding level of ap proximately $36.7 billion in FY 2032. When compared with the FY 2022 Enacted level of $6. 8 billion, the FY 2032 proposed funding level represents an increase of nearly +$30 billion or +4 42 percent. In total, the 10-year budget includes over $248 billion for the IHS. Targeted investments include the following: CJ - 7 Inflation Factors : After the first year, IHS funding would automatically grow to keep pace with healthcare costs and population growth. Specifically, the bu dget grows by inflationary factors, such as Employment Cost Index (ECI), Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI -U), and CPI-U Medical, as assumed in the 2023 OMB economic assumptions during the 10 -year budget window. Funding also grows by the IH S service population growth factor (1.8 percent) during the 10 -year budget window. Including automatic inflationary increases in the budget ensures that funding for direct health care services is not eroded by the impacts of inflation, pay cost increases, and population growth. 2018 Indian Health Care Improvement Fund (IHCIF) Level of Need Funded Gap : Over five years, from FY 2024 to FY 2028, the budget addresses the funding gap for direct healthcare services documented in the FY 2018 level of need funded analysis. The level of need gap analysis calculated $11.2 billion as the point in time estimated funding shortfall identified for a baseline of health services in FY 2018. At that time, the overall funds needed were determined to be $16.203 billion. In FY 2018, the IHS received $4.9 billion in resources for direct health care services, which leaves a funding deficiency of $11.2 billion. Over five years, these funding increases would be distributed proportionally across the IHS funding lines that provide dir ect healthcare services, including: Hospitals and Health Clinics, Purchased/Referred Care, Dental Health, Mental Health, Alcohol and Substance Abuse, IHCIF, Public Health Nursing, Health Education, Community Health Representatives, and Urban Indian Health. This approach ensures a broad benefit of this increased funding for all Tribes, while also seeking to address funding disparities within the Indian health system. Electronic Health Records (EHR) Modernization : Provides +$6 billion over five years, from F Y 2024 to FY 2028, to replace IHS's EHR with a modernized system. The current IHS EHR is over 50 years old, and the GAO identifies it as one of the 10 most critical federal legacy systems in need of modernization. The IHS relies on its EHR for all aspects of patient care, including the patient record, prescriptions, care referrals, and billing public and private insurance for over $1 billion reimbursable health care services annually. The EHR holds an extremely high degree of mission criticality given the ability to provide much -anticipated clinical and administrative capabilities used in modern systems for the delivery of timely and impactful healthcare. Expected benefits from adopting and implementing a modernized system include, but are not limited to, improved patient safety, improved patient outcomes, better disease management, enhanced population health, improved clinical quality measures, opioid tracking, patient data exchange, third party revenue generation, ag ency performance reporting, etc. Additionally, the new system will obtain interoperability with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Defense, tribal and urban Indian health programs, academic affiliates, and community partners, many of wh om are on different health information technology (HIT) platforms. Medical Equipment : The budget includes +$454 million over five years, from FY 2024 to FY 2028, to ensure IHS can replace medical and laboratory equipment at the end of its six to eight -year life cycle . Many IHS hospital administrators reported that old or inadequate physical environments challenged their ability to provide quality care and maintain compliance with the Medicare Hospital Conditions of Participation. Further, the administrato rs reported that aging buildings and equipment is a major challenge impacting recruitment and retention of clinicians. Health Care Facilities Construction 1993 Priority List : Funds the remaining projects on the IHS 1993 Health Care Facilities Constructi on Priority List over five years , from FY to FY 2028, CJ Phoenix, AZ; Whit eriver Hospital, Whiteriver, AZ; Gallup Indian Medical Center, Gallup, NM ; Albuquerque West Health Center, Albuquerque, NM; Albuquerque C entral H ealth Center, Albuquerque, NM; and Sells Health Center, Sells, AZ. CJ - 9Overview of Agency Performance The FY 2023 budget request provides critical support in assuring the availability and expansion of health care services, assuring the quality of services, and in providing operational support for the Indian health care system. The IHS budget supports monitoring of clinical measures, including childhood and adult immunizations; breastfeeding rates ; critical health screenings; access to dental services and preventive procedures such as, dental sealants and topical fluorides; and several diabetes care measures. Included below is an overview of the IHS performance reporting process to monitor budget measures and performance management process to monitor agency progress. A brief summary of the COVID-19 impact on the health care system and performance reporting is also included below. Performance Reporting The IHS budget measures support the agency's strategic goals and objectives and are focused on monitoring population health (clinical measures) and strategies to assess program trends and managem ent (non- clinical measures). In the FY 2022 President's Budget, IHS previously reported \"interim\" clinical measure results. The FY 2023 IHS outcomes and outputs table includes a list of all budget measures and final clinical measure results for FY 2021 an d FY 2020. IHS reports valid and reliable aggregated clinical measures using a centralized reporting system to meet the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and GPRA Modernization Act (GPRAMA) requirements. IHS annually reports GPRA/GPRAMA clinical measure results. Tribes administer over 63.2 percent of IHS resources through ISDEAA contracts and compacts and may choose to participate in IHS GPRA/GPRAMA performance reporting. Many Tribal programs operate EHR systems that differ from the IHS EHR, Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS). Since 2002, IHS has reported electronic population level results for GPRA/GPRAMA clinical measures. Over time, as more Tribes assumed responsibility of providing health care for their members and adopted non-RPMS EHR systems, the agency's clinical performance measure results primarily reflected IHS programs. Prior to FY 2018, IHS clinical measure results reflected only RPMS data as non -RPMS data could not be verified or validated for budget- related performanc e reporting. Beginning in FY 2018, the IHS clinical results were reported from a new system, the Integrated Data Collection System Data Mart (IDCS DM). 1 The IDCS DM provides those Tribes using non -RPMS EHRs the opportunity to report data for GPRA/GPRAMA purposes; reporting is optional for Tribes. The IDCS DM calculates measure results using any data (RPMS, non- RPMS or Fiscal Intermediary) submitted to the IHS National Data Warehouse (NDW) and assures reporting of valid and reliable clinical measure results. The IHS clinical GPRA/GPRAMA measure results are reported from the IDCS DM and reflect aggregated Federal, Tribal, and urban (I/T/U) results. Tribal programs have the option to participate in IDCS DM reporting and aggregated results include partic ipating Tribal programs. 1 The IDCS DM uses all data exported to the NDW, including non -RPMS tribal and urban data. Budget measures previously reported from RPMS cannot be compared to IDCS DM results because: IDCS DM standardizes the use of user po pulation estimates as the denominator for clinical GPRA/GPRAMA measures, and the reporting year changes from July 1 -June 30 (GPRA/GPRAMA year) to October 1 -September 30 (to match the user population estimate report year). CJ - 10COVID -19 Impact During FYs 2020- 2021, the Indian health care system has experienced fewer in -person visits as many patients postponed prevention and health maintenance appointments to reduce coronavirus (COVID -19) exposure risk. Several sites also transitioned fr om in -person primary care to virtual care or reduced services to minimize the risk of COVID -19 transmission, and prioritize COVID- 19 testing and response. While patients with acute illnesses or the need for emergency care are still seen at IHS facilities, many patients may be unable or unwilling to have in -person visits during the COVID-19 pandemic due to limited services available or to reduce personal risk. The changes in health care delivery may impact clinical GPRA measures results. During FY 2021, t he IHS modified its delivery system and may have shifted priorities to address the COVID -19 response , examples include: focusing on COVID- 19 vaccine distribution and administration; ensuring access to COVID -19 testing; distribution of COVID - 19 resources to support Tribal communities; ongoing expansion or enhancement of telehealth services; and addressing infrastructure challenges to increase access to water. Performance Management IHS cascades performance goals and objectives and performance- related metrics agency -wide, and aligns them with the agency's strategic plan (see diagram below). Specific measures cascade from senior executive performance plans to those of subordinate managers and superviso rs. From there, they cascade into employee performance plans, which ensures that performance of all employees relates to key agency performance objectives. Agency leadership periodically reviews progress in meeting these agency performance objectives, holding regular discussions with senior executives to identify challenges to success and determine feasible solutions. Agency leadership then implements those solutions, making specific adjustments or taking corrective actions that eliminate or minimize obstacles preventing the achievement of desired results. The connection between performance objectives, performance measures, and employee accountability enables agency leadership to direct the efforts of the workforce more accurately, and to make more informed and effective decisions. The impact is greater success in meeting the full array of agency mission requirements.

T he budget narratives that follow this summary include detailed explanations of the request. CJ - 29 Hospitals and Health Clinics , supports essential personal health services and community based disease prevention and health promotion services. Health services includ e: inpatient care, routine and emergency ambulatory care ; and medical support services including laboratory, pharmacy, nutrition, diagnostic imaging, medical records, physical therapy, and other services . Specialized programs are conducted to address : diabetes; maternal and child health ; youth services; communicable diseases including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) /acquired immune deficiency syndrome , tuberculosis, and hepatitis; women's and men's health; geriatric health ; disease surveillance; and healthcare quality improvement. Electronic Health Record (EHR) , holds an extremely high degree of mission criticality given the ability to provide much -anticipated clinical and administrative capabilities used in modern systems for the delivery of timely and impactful healthcare. Expected benefits from adopting and implementing a modernized or new system include but are not limited to improved patient safety, improved patient outcomes, better disease management, enhanced population health, improved clinical quality measures, opioid tracking, patient data exchange, third party revenue generation, agency performance reporting, etc. By identifying and properly selecting the best match for proposed system capabilities, the system will support the IHS mission. Additionally, the IHS will obtain interoperability with the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense , tribal and urban Indian health programs, academic affiliates, and community partners, many of whom are on different Health Information Technology platforms. The IHS must consider an integrated EHR system solution that will allow for a meaningfu l integration to create a system that serves IHS/Tribal/Urban beneficiaries in the best possible way. Dental Health , supports preventive care , basic care, and emergency care, with approximately 90 percent of services covering basic and emergency care. Basic services are prioritized over more complex rehabilitative care such as root canals, crown s and bridges, dentures, and surgical extractions . The demand for dental treatment remains high due to a high dental caries rate in American Indian and Alaska Native ( AI/AN) children; however, a continuing emphasis on community oral health promotion and disease prevention is essential to impact long-term improvement of the oral health of AI/AN people. Men tal Health , supports a community- oriented clinical and preventive mental health service program that provides outpatient mental health and related services, crisis triage, case management, prevention programming, and outreach services. Alcohol and Substance Abuse , supports an integrated behavioral health approach to collaboratively reduce the incidence of alcoholism and other drug dependencies in AI/AN communities. Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) , supports the purchase of essential health care services not available in IHS and Tribal healthcare facilities including inpatient and outpatient care, routine emergency ambulatory care, transportation, specialty care services (mammograms, colonoscopies, etc.), and medical support services (e.g., laboratory, pharmacy, nutrition, diagnostic imaging, physical therapy, etc.). The demand for PRC remains high as the cost of medical care increases. The PRC program continues to emphasize adherence to medical priorities, enrolling patients in alternate resources available to them (such as Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance), negotiating discounted rates with medical providers, and implementing improvements recommended by Tribes and oversight authorities. CJ - 30 The majority of clinical services funds are provided to 12 Area (regional) Of fices that distribute resources, monitor and evaluate activities, and provide administrative and technical support to approximately 2.6 million AI/ANs through a network of over 600 hospitals, clinics, and health stations on or near Indian reservations in service areas that are rural, isolated, and underserved. Performance Summary Table The following long- term performance measures are considered overarching because they are accomplished through a variety of programs and activities in the IHS Services budget.

Direct Federal , P.L. 93 -638 contracts and compacts, Tribal shares, interagency agreements, commercial contracts, and grants PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Hospitals and Health Clinics (H&HC) funds essential , personal health services for approximat ely 2.6 million American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). The Indian Health Service (IHS ) provides medical and surgical inpatient care , routine and emergency ambulatory care, and medical support services including laboratory, pharmacy, nutrition, diagnostic imaging, medical records, and physical therapy. The IHS direct health care services supports the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023 and integrates the Department's Strategic Goal to protec t the health of Americans (HHS Strategic Plan FY 2022-2026, Goal 2 Safeguard and Improve National and Global Health Conditions and Outcomes, O bjective 2.1.Improve capabilities to predict, prepare for, and respond to public health emergencies and threats in the nation and across the globe ; Objective 2.2.Protect individuals, families, and communities against communicable, and infectious disease through effective, innovative, readily available and equitable delivery of treatments, therapeutics, medical devices, and vaccines; & Objective 2.3. Enhance promotion of healthy lifestyle choices to reduce occurrence and disparities in preventable injury, illness, and death) . The IHS and tribes primari ly serve small, rural populations with primary medical care and community health services, relying on the private sector for much of the secondary and most of the tertiary medical care needs. Some IHS and tribal hospitals provide secondary medical service s such as ophthalmology, orthopedics, infectious disease, emergency medicine, radiology, general and gynecological surgery, and anesthesia. The IHS system of care is unique in that personal health care services are integrated with community health services. The program includes public/community health programs targeting health conditions disproportionately affecting AI/AN populations such as diabetes, maternal and child health, and communicable diseases including influenza, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( HIV/AIDS ), and viral hepatitis. The health status of AI/AN people has improved significantly in the past 60 years since IHS' s inception . However, CJ - 32AI/AN people born today have a life expectancy th at is 5.5 years l ess than the U.S. all races population, 73.0 years to 78.5 years, respectively .1 More than 60 percent of the H&HC budget is transferred under P.L. 93-638 contracts or compacts to tribal governments or tribal organizations that design and manage the delivery of individual and community health services through 22 hospitals, 31 9 health centers, 79 health stations , 146 Alaska village clinics , and 12 school health centers. The remainder of the H&HC budget is managed by direct federal programs that provide health care at the service unit and community level. The federal system consists of 24 hospitals (23 hospitals have emergency departments), 51 health centers, 25 health stations , and 12 school health centers. Collecting, analyzing, and interpreting health information is done through a network of tribally operated epidemiology centers in collaboration with a national IHS coordinating center leading to the identification of health conditions as well as promoting interventions. Information technology supports personal health services (including the Electronic Health Record and telemedicine) and public health initiatives (such as Baby Friendly Hospitals and Improving Patient Care ) that are primarily funded through the H&HC budget . The H&HC funds provide critical support for direct health care services, ensures comprehensive, culturally appropriate services, provides available and accessible personnel , promotes excellence and quality through implemented quality improvement strategies, and strengthens the IHS program management and operations to raise the health status of AI/AN populations to the highest level ( IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 1, To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people; Goal 2, To promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization; Goal 3, To strengthen IHS program management and operations ; HHS Strategic Plan FY 2022-2026 Goal 1, Protect and Strengthen Equitable Access to High Quality and Affordable Health Care, Objective 1.3.Expand equitable access to comprehensive, community- based, innovative, and culturally -competent health care services while recognizing social determinants of health & Objective 1.4. Drive the integration of behavioral health into the healthcare system to strengthen and expand access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment and recovery services for individuals and families ). PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The following are examples of specific activities funded through H&HC that improve the quality of services throughout the IHS healthcare system: Office of Quality - Established in FY 2019, the IHS Office of Quality (OQ) has made significant quality and patient safety improvements across the Agency. The OQ has three divisions: 1) Quality Assurance; 2) Patient Safety and Clinical Risk Management; and, 3) Innovation and Improvement that lead the work on oversight of policy and accreditation standards, implementation of quality improve ment strategies, and monitoring accountability of federally- operated facilities. A ccomplishments activities and accomplishments include the following: 1 Data comparing the AI/AN population to the U.S. general population are documented and updated annually by the IHS. CJ - 33 The o ngoing Agency response to novel coronavirus disease (COVID -19) has continued to impact the IHS , forcing the Agency to rapidly redesign service delivery methods, increase vaccination acceptance and leverag e local, tribal, state and federal resources and guidance to safely and efficiently meet the continuing challenges and health care needs of AI/AN people while maintaining its commitment to the mission of the IHS. The OQ led this redesign , provided staff to serve as the planning section for the IHS Incident Command Structure (ICS); developing and disseminat ing four Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for COVID -19 response, contact tracing, recovery , and vaccine administration; collected situation and resource status information, analyzed it, and synthesized it for use in developing the Agency's Action P lan. The planning section support ed ICS operations and the distribution of guidance documents. The OQ continues to provide The Joint Commission (TJC), Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC), and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS ) accreditation updates on a monthly basis to provide awareness of changing standards and assist facilities to maintain compliance with updated and new standards and accreditation requirements during the pandemic. The continued work of the OQ to address C OVID -19 meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, To promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization, the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 3 To Strengthen IHS program management and operations, and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Strategic Objective 2.1 Improve capabilities to predict, prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from emergencies, disasters, and threats across the nation and globe. Strategic Plan Implementation - The IHS Strate gic Plan FY 2019-2023 provides the framework on how the IHS will achieve its mission (to raise the physical, mental, social, and spiritual health of AI/AN to the highest level) through three Goals, eight objectives, and 70 strategies. To monitor implement ation of the framework, the Office created a site that allows for IHS Area and Headquarter (HQ) Office s reporting into a centralized location, the Strategic Plan Activity Repository (SPAR). Area and HQ O ffices select high bar activities to include in the SPAR. These activities are updated quarterly (or more frequently as appropriate) and tied to a strategy. The IHS Strategic Plan has focused IHS programs and activities on improving quality, safety, and sustained compliance across the IHS healthcare system. As of December 20 22, 342 total activities from Areas and HQ offices are currently tied to the IHS Strategic Plan, all 12 Areas and 12 HQ offices have contributed activities and updates. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 5, Advance Strategic Management to Build Trust, Transparency, and Accountability. Quality Assurance - The Division of Quality Assurance focused intently on ensuring quality of care in IHS facilities through external accreditation and certification support. The OQ provides survey readiness support by making available tools, resources, and consultation for all IHS Area Offices and faciliti es. The OQ supported and provided assistance to IHS facilities in all 12 IHS Areas to achieve and maintain TJC and AAAHC accreditation standards and CMS regulations for IHS Hospitals, Health Centers, Behavioral Health facilities, and Critical Assess Hospi tals (CAH). The IHS has also directed that all ambulatory care facilities attain Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) designation by the end of Calendar Year (CY) 2022. As of September 2021, 100 percent of all IHS hospitals and CAHs have achieved and maintained CMS conditions of participation, 21 of 24 hospitals and CAHs have TJC accreditation. All 29 eligible IHS health centers are accredited by TJC or the AAAHC, with 1 additional health center that is ineligible for accreditation because it does not provide the services required to obtain accreditation. 90 percent of the IHS health centers and 71 percent of IHS hospitals with ambulatory care services have attained PCMH designation. The remaining facilities without PCMH designation were affected CJ - 34by the inability of accreditation organizations to conduct surveys due to the COVID-19 public health emergency. In the first quarter of FY 2022, there were 16 successful surveys by TJC (including TJC Lab surveys), AAAHC, and CMS completed at facilities. This activ ity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 4, Strategic Objective 4.1 Improve the design, delivery, and outcomes of HHS progr ams by prioritizing science, evidence, and inclusion. In August 2020, the Labor and Delivery Service at Phoenix Indian Medical Center (PIMC) was temporarily closed due to safety concerns arising from facility infrastructure, equipment, and challenges with staffing. PIMC contracted for an intensive Joint Commission Resources Review in September 2020 as well as an internal review by the IHS Chief Clinical Consultant for Obstetrics on September 17 -18. Both reviews focused on facility deficiencies, equipment deficiencies, infection control, OB Triage, and interdisciplinary teamwork. To support addressing concerns identified in these reviews, IHS engaged a contractor to provide accreditation support and review care provided by the Obstetrics Department at PIMC. The contractor conducted a review of IHS operations at PIMC, provided a gap analysis, and then worked with IHS leadership and management to provide training and mentoring, providing training, sharing best practices and conducting a mock survey to test PIMC's readiness for an accreditation survey. In October 2021, TJC conducted an announced survey of PIMC, which resulted in reaccreditation. Without Accreditation Emergencies Funding, PIMC would have been forced to curtail some patient services to afford this level of support for their operations and could have lost tens of millions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska N ative communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 4, Strategic Objective 4. 2 Invest in the research enterprise and the scientific workforce to maintain leadership in the development of innovations that broaden our understanding of disease, healthcare, publ ic health, and human services resulting in more effective interventions, treatments, and programs. The IHS monitors the credentialing and privileging system and continuously optimizes its functions. In FY 2021, the OQ continues to improve the IHS credentialing and privileging process through the implementation of ASM Products credentialing and privileging software . All 11 eligible Areas use the software to facilitate the hiring and ongoing monitoring of qualified practitioners. The OQ provides technical assistance through training and support to Areas and facilities for ASM use and promotes the transition to 100 percent paperless. The OQ is also facilitating a quality improvement project for standardization. The system completes a monthly check on an average of 3,000 active medical staff provider credentials, flagging any negatively changed items and to date has processed nearly 2,459 initial appointment and reappointment applications. Phase I of the standardization project is at 96 percent implemen tation across all IHS areas. In FY 2021, standardization increased from 54 percent to 95 percent (over 40 percent increase), there were 858 initial applications, 2,791 reappointment applications, 141,445 total verifications, and MD- Staff reports gen erated. As of December 2021, the system continues to process user Logins, virtual Committee Reviews, MD -App Initial Applications, and MD-App - Reappointment Applications. The improved credentialing and privileging process meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goa l 3, Objective 3.3 Modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decisions and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 4, Strategic Objective 4. 1 Improve the design, delivery, and outcomes of HHS programs by prioritizing science, evid ence, and inclusion. Patient Safety and Clinical Risk Management - The IHS Safety Tracking & Response (I -STAR), a system for reporting adverse events, is fully implemented across the Agency. The IHS monitors CJ - 35the system and is continuously optimizing its functions. In FY 2021, events were reported in I- STAR from 172 facilities and 42 Tribal facilities. 20,668 events were entered with 7,637 medication good catch events entered. In FY 2021, the OQ began holding regular office hours and provided 37 Q&A sessions; modified I-STAR to allow for enhanced reporting and collection of data for sexual assault and worker COVID -19 vaccine ADRs; developed back -up forms for user use during I -STAR downtimes; developed an IHS Medication Safety Dashboard that includes 13 standard reports commonly used for reporting medication errors to Area Governing Boards; added three new facilities as I -STAR users; developed a new I -STAR profile to help Tribal I -STAR users to review and close events; developed and disseminated five I -STAR Updates to provide an overview of use and education tips to help users; developed and posted 13 new job aides to assist users; added 33 new drugs to the I -STAR formulary; and, migrated non- patient safety data from WebCident I -STAR. In FY 2022, through December 2021 , events were reported in I-STAR from 135 facilities and 32 Tribal facilities. These sites entered 5,172 events with 1,746 medication good catch events entered. A good catch event is an event or a potential safety hazard that is caught before it reaches a patient, worker, visitor, or facility. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 4, Strategic Object ive 4.1 Improve the design, delivery, and outcomes of HHS programs by prioritizing science, evidence, and inclusion. The Infection Prevention and Control program drafted the IHS Indian Health Manual Infection C ontrol and Prevention (Chapter 33), the purpose of the chapter is to establish infection control and prevention program policies, procedures, and responsibilities required for ensuring a comprehensive Infection Control and Prevention (ICP) program exists in all IHS health care facilities and Service Units. An ICP program is required to meet and maintain readiness with applicable healthcare accreditation standards. The IHS manages the ICP listserv with 312 I/T/U users that regularly distributes infection prevention and control resources, updates and provides expert technical assistance across the health system. In FY 2021, the IHS concluded an Infection Control Assessment and Response (ICAR) project that provided 43 COVID-19 infection control assessments at IHS and Tribal facilities in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). To date in FY 2022, the ICP program has completed one ICAR at a Nashville Area Youth Regional Treatment Center . ICAR sites report increased understanding of CDC infection prevention and control guidelines, increased accreditation readiness, and leadership commitment to implementing changes to improve infection control and prevention practices. Following the ICAR assessments, the IHS -CDC ICAR team provides a written report that identifies strength and recommendations/resources for improvement opportunities. Facilities are advised to track improvements and implementation of best practices through local Governing Board Quality Management Programs. ICARs have been designated as \"best practice\" by multiple accreditation surveyors and of noted value in mitigating risk in reference to Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) investigations. The ICP coordinated with the Organiza tion for Safety Asepsis and Prevention (OSAP) to secure tribal and Urban Indian Organization scholarships for the annual OSAP Dental Infection Control Bootcamp, which was held in January 2022. In total, 14 tribal scholarships were awarded and participants will be able to describe disease transmission and principles of infection prevention and control in a variety of oral health care settings; identify relevant infection control laws, regulations, guidelines, standards, and best practices; and, utilize tools to assist with quality assurance measures. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 4, Strategic Objective 4.1 Improve the design, delivery, and outcomes of HHS programs by prioritizing science, evidence, and inclusion. CJ - 36Innovation and Improvement - The Division of Innovation and Improvement has increased quality improvement capacity within the Agency. A survey was developed to assess the experience and satisfaction with the care provided. This Patient Experience of Care Survey was established to develop a standardized survey instrument for use at all IHS health care facilities. These anonymous surveys are administered and the results analyzed individually by each IHS healthcare facility to determine what improvements, if any, are required to improve the patient experience. In FY 2021, the survey was made available Agency wide and received renewed OMB approval through February 2025. By directly gathering the opinions and experiences of our patients, the s urvey directly supports improved quality of care provided by the IHS. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2 , Objective 2.2 Provide care to better mee t the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and HHS Strategic Plan Goal 4, Strategic Objective 4.1 Improve the design, delivery, and outcomes of HHS programs by prioritizing science, evidence, and inclusion. T he OQ continues implementation of the accelerated model for improvement (AmiTM) improvement science framework, and provides the Healthcare Improvement Professionals (HIP) training to support quality improvement initiatives throughout the IHS areas. There are 44 HIPs implementing various improvement projects and Ami TM. The OQ tracks improvement projects, which change throughout the year. As of December 2021, 32 quality improvement projects were actively being implemented across the Agency , with 13 projects completed, and three change packages are available for Agency dissemination. The projects focus on improving both administrative and clinical processes, all project information is housed on a server that allows for sharing across the Agency resulting in increased transparency of new best practices. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.1 Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Nativ e communities, and HHS Strategic Plan Goal 4, Strategic Objective 4.1 Improve the design, delivery, and outcomes of HHS programs by prioritizing science, evidence, and inclusion. The OQ manages the Innovations Projects, which started its 5th year on October 1, 2021. T he purpose of the project is to develop and implement quality improvement innovation initiatives to that support the Patient Centered Medical Home and result in measurable improvement in care and outcomes. These projects increase the capabil ity of IHS, Tribal and Urban Indian Health programs to provide comprehensive, patient- centered care that improves health outcomes for persons with complex needs and address social determinants of health. The funded 2021 Innovations Projects include: U te Mountain Ute Health Center: Outpatient clinic integration of a pharmacist provide increased access to and equitable distribution of quality health care , Lawton SU: PCMH Orientation Book , Whiteriver SU: Incorporation a Dedicated Behavioral Health Pharmacist into the PCMH , Western Oregon SU: Addressing social determinants of health to decrease obesity rates at Chemawa Indian Health Center, Yakama SU: Screen and treat obesity, adopting materials from a proven curriculum called MOVE! , Phoenix Area Off ice: Co - development of quality measures to assess the patient journey ), and American Indian Health & Services (UIO): Modernize Data Collection. Funded project teams will use the Ami model to guide and implement their projects. Three projects completed pa rticipation at the end of September 2021. The Oklahoma City Indian Clinic redesigned prenatal services to decrease morbidity and mortality of women ages of 15-44 from pregnancy related complications. This project increased the number of patients enrolled for prenatal care from 43 to 94. Ft. Hall Service Unit redesign ed collaborative management of patients with diabetes to decrease percent of high risk diabetic patients resulting in increased patient satisfaction and a decrease in average A1C from 9.5 to 8.9 and decreased cost of continuous glucose monitoring from $178 to $151. Wellpinit Service Unit collaborated with Bureau of Indian Affairs to redesign telehealth to CJ - 37increase the number of inmate patient telehealth visits. This resulted in increased telehealth visits, decreased staff burden, and permanent adoption of the model. Information for all three projects is available for use by other facilities to encourage system spread. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.1 Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities, and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 3 Strengthen Social Well -Being, Equity, and Economic Resili ence. Improving Patient Care (IPC) Program - The purpose of the IPC Program is to promote the development and application of the quality improvement processes and to promote the implementation of the PCMH model of care to improve the health and wellness of AI/AN people. The IPC program provides a model of collaborative learning to develop proficiency in quality improvement methodologies, data management and analysis are used to drive improvements. The IPC program supports the continued learning of IHS staff. As of December 2021, the IPC program provides 219 subscriptions to the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Open School to support I/T/U facility staff in their quality improvement efforts. In 2021, the IHS continued support of the web based collaborative learning environment, the Quality Portal, to disseminate quality improvement and PCMH information. The portal includes subscription and notification settings, integration of a calendar invitation, the ability for the IHS staff to create \"affinity groups\" to manage quality improvement work, and the ability to upload resources when replying to a request in the Community Exchange. In 2021, subject matter experts provided responses to 110 questions and 460 documents were added in the Resources Section. The customer experience continued to improve through functionality enhancements such as the workgroups to expand the Community Exchange. As of December 202 1, a total of 975 I/T/U members participate in this knowledge exchange. The IPC Program monitors areas for improvements though regular quality portal analytic reports . This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.1 Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better mee t the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities , and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 4, Strategic Objective 4.1 Improve the design, delivery, and outcomes of HHS programs by prioritizing science, evidence, and inclusion. T he IPC program supports I/T/U facilities in providing them with the tools and resources needed to determine when a change is an improvement and to monitor the spread and scale-up of change using PCMH measures. The IPC program continues to develop an ambulatory care measure set integrated in the health information system in collaboration with the IHS Office of Information Technology (OIT). There are currently 19 approved measures and in FY 2022, the majority of these measures were available in our populat ion health management tool (iCare) for facilities to view, monitor, and use to guide quality improvement measures. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.1 Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization, Obj ective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities , and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 4, Strategic Objective 4.1 Improve the design, delivery, and outcomes of HHS programs by prioritizing science, evidence, and inclusion. Establishment of the National Compliance Program : In J anuary 2020, the IHS initiated the development of a national compliance program (NCP). The NCP was established for many reasons, including to address the recommendations made by the HHS Office of Inspector General (https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-06-16-00390.asp. T he NCP was a significant step forward in strengthening IHS HQ oversight responsibilities. The NCP itsel f is broadly overseen by a senior official, the Deputy Director for Quality Health Care, through the IHS Chief Compliance Officer assigned full time to lead the NCP. Seven key components of the OIG framework for compliance programs for health care provide rs have guided the IHS NCP activities. These include: CJ - 381. Designated compliance professionals; 2. Written policies and procedures; 3. Effective communication; 4. Effective training; 5. Enforcement of standards; 6. Internal auditing and monitoring; and 7. Prompt, responsiv e corrective action plans. This activity meets the IHS Strat egic Plan Goal 3, Objective 3.2 Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 5, Strategic Objective 5.1 Promote effective enterprise governance to ensure programmatic goals are met equitably and transparently across all management practices. Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Audit under OMB Circular A123 In FY 2021, IHS re -competed a 5 year small business contract for OMB Circular A123 support services. A s of September 30, 2021, the result of testing of controls in FY2021 led to the reduction of the IHS' only material weakness from the prior year. IHS d eveloped an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Profile for FY 2022, to inform compliance activities throughout the year. This activity meets the IHS Strat egic Plan Goal 3, Objective 3.2 Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources, and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 5, Strategic Objective 5.1, Promote effective enterprise governance to ensu re programmatic goals are met equitably and transparently across all management practices and Strategic Objective 5.2, Sustain strong financial stewardship of HHS resources to foster prudent use of resources, accountability, and public trust. National HQ Oversight Reviews One of the first major activities initiated by the NCP was to reinstate HQ Oversight Reviews on a bi-annual basis in 2020 as a component of that overall effort. Subjects included in the content of the 2020 HQ Oversight Reviews were chose n with the following considerations: High -Risk Areas identified in IHS Enterprise Risk Management discussions in 2018 and 2019. Un-remediated findings from prior year internal audits High frequency of findings by both GAO and OIG. Review topics during 2020 and 2021 were based on assessing compliance with regulatory areas, agency -wide policies in the Indian Health Manual, CMS Conditions of Participation, and accreditation standards for IHS hospitals. Results from these reviews will continuously inform further work and priorities of the NCP. The HQ Oversight Review activity spanned 2 years, and a review of high risk subject areas of all 12 IHS Areas has been fully completed as of January 2022. The next 2-year cycle will be initiated in 2022, and the ERM program will inform the topics to be decided for review in the 2022- 2024 review cycle. This activity meets the IHS Strat egic Plan Goal 3, Objective 3.2 Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 5, Strategic Objective 5.1 Promote effective enterprise governance to ensure programmatic goals are met equitably and transparently across all management practices. Quality Assurance/Risk Management In FY 2020, IHS established the Quality Assurance Risk Management Committee (QARMC) to provide senior level oversight and management of complex, adverse patient safety events and administrative matters involving fraud, waste, abuse, and employee misconduct within IHS- CJ - 39operated hospitals and clinics; and perform Agency- wide clinical and administrative risk management to identify systematic changes needed to improve the quality of health care services and IHS- operated hospitals and clinics. The QARMC is a component of the overall ERM governance structure and is intended to ensure enterprise -wide accountability and effectiveness of those internal and external reporting systems, necessary management responses, and swift and effective corrective action . To date, IHS has closed over 100 cases that have bene tracked and monitored by Area Directors, and the QARMC. All IHS Area Directors have developed local processes to coordinate with the HQ QARMC and to ensure all reporting requirements within each IHS Area are understood and followed. Policies and procedures, and related staff training are under development to ensure clarity around new, streamlined reporting systems. Excellent collaboration between the IHS and OIG with joint training opportunities for compliance and overall improvements is making reporting more timely, efficient, and responsive. This activity meets the IHS Strat egic Plan Goal 3, Objective 3.2 Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 5, Strategic Objective 5.1 Promote effective enterprise governance to ensure programmatic goals are met equitably and transparently across all management practices. New IHS -OIG child/sexual abuse hotline In January 2021, IHS established a key partnership with OIG Office of Investigations/OIG Hotline Manger to develop and implement a first of its kind, new child abuse/sexual abuse hotline. The new Hotline uses a mnemonic for the phone number: 1 -855-S AFE -IHS. This required key collaborations with the OIG that was led by the NCP. This new special hotline was fully implemented in January, 2021. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 3, Objective 3.2 Secure and effectively manage the assets and resources and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 5, Strategic Objective 5.1, Promote effective enterprise governance to ensure programmatic goals are met equitably and transparently across all management practices and Strategic Objective 5.2, Sustain strong financial stewardship of HHS resources to foster prudent use of resources, accountability, and public trust. Nursing - Nursing represents the largest category of health care providers in the Indian h e alth system and has a major impact on patient safety and health care outcomes. Nurses are actively engaged in the transformation of the health care system by placing more emphasis on prevention, wellness, and coordination of care. C ollaborations have been established with Tribal health care systems with the goal of providing safe and quality care for Native communities. A collaborative agreement was formed between IHS and the Chickasaw Nation Medical Center, Ada, Oklahoma, to enhan ce clinical competencies for IHS Emergency Department, Perioperative Room, and Labor and Delivery Registered Nurses ( RNs). The agreement is designed to enhance IHS specialty nurse s' clinical competency through preceptored clinical rotations offered at the T ribally-managed Chickasaw Medical Center, which maintains higher patient volume. Factors that impact IHS' s capacity to assist RNs to maintain their level of clinical competency, beyond initial licensure, credentialing, and continuing education, are attributable to geographically isolated IHS hospitals that are further challenged with fluctuating patient volume. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native commu nities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goals 1, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality Healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. The Division of Nursing Services (DNS) implemented the Rural Obstetrical Nurse Residency Program (RONR). The purpose of RONR is to facilitate a structured professional nursing CJ - 40experience for new and inexperienced obstetrical nurses in an effort to alleviate critical shortages of practicing nurses within the Indian Health System. To sustain the RONR, DN S led a workgroup to develop and draft a RONR charter. The workgroup consisted of Area Nurse Consultants through the agency. This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alas ka Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goals 1, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality Healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. DNS made available 400 subscriptions to the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) web -based course. The web course was offered to Registered Nurses and Advanced Practice Nurses who care for patients in the emergency department, urgent care or other critical care settings, as well as nurses who provide additional coverage for these units . This activity meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 Provide care to better meet the needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities and the HHS Strategic Plan Goals 1, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high quality Healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition. HIV Program - A ccording to CDC's HIV Surveillance Report using data reported through December 2020, in 2019, 36,801 people received an HIV diagnosis in the United States and dependent areas. Of those, approximately less than 1 percent (210) new HIV diagnosis were Americ an Indian or Alaska Native. The overall HIV diagnosis trend shows 9 percent decrease from 2015. In the same CDC report, the rate of diagnoses of new HIV infection among AI/AN adults and adolescents increased by 18 percent. The HIV diagnosis rate is appro ximately 9 per 100,000 for AI/AN compared to 5 per 100,000 for Whites. From 2015-2019, the HIV diagnosis increased by 24 percent among AI/AN men with male- to-male (MSM) sexual contact as the HIV transmission. Among AI/AN women, the main transmission route was heterosexual contact, accounting for 60 percent of new diagnoses, followed by injection drug use at 40 percent of new diagnoses. 2 In this same CDC report, the death rate among AI/AN people living with HIV in 2019 was 19 percent lower than in 2015.3 While IHS cannot infer direct causation on a national scale, the largest HIV treatment programs like those at the Phoenix and Gallup Indian Medical Centers show outstanding HIV testing, linkage to care, and viral suppression outcomes among their HIV patien ts. These sites use intensive and specialized case management to initiate care, adherence, and support for co- morbidities and social barriers that are unique to their patients' social and cultural contexts. In IHS, HIV screening increases are plateauing at 50 percent to 60 percent of those who have used IHS clinics in the past three years, especially in large IHS hospitals. Some of IHS' primary care facilities reach screening rates over 90 percent , but not all IHS patients access primary care and th erefore go unscreened for HIV. It is important to remember that while HIV screening programs in emergency departments, urgent care, and other non -primary care settings is crucial, these programs are difficult to start and sustain.

Published May 2021. Accessed August 10, 2021. 3 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. HIV Surveillance Report, 2019; vol. 32. http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/library/reports/hiv- surveillance.html. Published May 2021. Accessed August 10, 2021. CJ - 41IHS data shows that from 2005-2014, there were 2,273 HIV diagnoses in IHS facilities.4 CDC data ranks AI/AN people fourth in the nation for the estimated rate of new HIV diagnoses when compared with all other races and ethnicities. Diagnosing HIV quickly and linking people to treatment immediately are crucial to achieving further reduction in new HIV infections. Although the United States is making significant progress in improving HIV outcomes, significant challenges remain. Gaps in the H IV care continuum are driving HIV transmission. By ensuring that everyone with HIV is aware of their status, receives the treatment they need, and achieves and maintains viral suppression \u2014key steps in the HIV care continuum \u2014we can preserve the health of people with HIV, improve the quality of their lives, and drive down new HIV infections 5. Primary care providers are the front line for detecting and preventing the spread of HIV. People with HIV who are aware of their status should be prescribed antiretroviral therapy (ART ) and, by achieving and maintaining an undetectable (<200 copies/mL) viral load, can remain healthy for many years.6 ART is now recommended for all people with HIV, regardless of CD4 count.7 Studies show that the sooner people start treatment after diagnosis, the more they benefit from ART. Early diagnosis followed by prompt ART initiation8: Reduces HIV -associated morbidity and mortality; Greatly decreases HIV transmission to others; and May reduce risk of serious non- AIDSrela ted diseases. A new analysis from CDC shows the vast majority - or about 80 percent - of new HIV infections in the U.S. in 2016 were transmitted from the nearly 40 percent of people with HIV who either did not know they had HIV, or who had been diagnosed but were not receiving HIV care 9. There is no reason to believe this statistic is different among American In dian and Alaska Native people. These data underscore the impact of undiagnosed and untreated HIV in the nation and also the critical need to expand HIV testing and treatment throughout Indian Country. While IHS has done excellent screening in primary care, annual increases in screening are experiencing diminishing returns, and we are looking at ways to better screen patients who do not have \u2014 or use \u2014 a primary care provider, such as those individuals using only emergency departments and urgent care clinics. 4 Reilley B, Haberling DL, Person M, Leston J, Iralu J, Haverkate R, Siddiqi AE.

JAMA 2016;316:171 CDC, from 2010 to 2017, the annual number of HIV diagnoses increased 39 percent among AI/AN overall, but t rends varied by age and gender. While HIV diagnoses for AI/AN women remained stable, CDC's most recent data shows a 54 percent increase for men. When looking at age grouping among AI/AN, CDC data shows a 67 percent increase in HIV diagnoses for thos e in the 25-34- year-old group. Most new diagnoses were among gay and bisexual men - a group that accounted for 77 percent of all AI/AN diagnoses. In the same report, the CDC also stated that when compared to other people overall with HIV, AI/AN people have lower viral sup pression rates. For every 100 AI/AN with HIV, 60 received some HIV care, 46 were retained in care, a nd 49 were virally suppressed.10 AI/AN living in the U.S. Southwest have more than 50 percent of all HIV diagnoses in the IHS system. Over 500 IHS patient s are currently in HIV treatment in the Southwest, with over 85 percent viral suppression. IHS programs supported by the Minority HIV/AIDS Fund in the Southwest include PIMC, GIMC, Chinle, and Northern Navajo Medical Center (Shiprock). Data from the Southwest show that viral suppression rates are above 85 percent and moving the needle positively on statewide AI/AN HIV statistics in those states. The HIV Program goal is to prevent new HIV infections and ensure access to quality health services for A I/ANs living with HIV (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023 Goal 1, To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people, Objective 1.1 Recruit, develop , and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce , 1.2 Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships , & 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services ; Goal 2, To promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization, Objective 2.1 Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization & 2.2 Provide care to better meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities ). IHS i ncreased overall prenatal HIV screening to 87 percent in FY 2016 - a 15 percent increase over FY 2006 data (HHS Strategic Plan FY 2022- 2026 Goal 1, Protect and Strengthen Equitable Access to High Quality and Affordable Health Care, Objective 1.3.Expand equitable access to comprehensive, community- based, innovative, and culturally - competent health care services while recognizing social determinants of health ). To improve AI/AN access to health care in remote areas, the IHS HIV Program provides technical support to IHS, tribal, and urban Indian health sites on screening and treatment, and the use of telehealth. In spring 2021, the IHS National HIV/HCV Program received $10.5 million from the HHS Minority HIV/AIDS Fund to expand partnerships between the IHS and Native communities to End the HIV epidemic in the U.S. National- level projects include the following: 1. National Continuum of Care ($750,000); 2. Project Red Talon ($1,248,483); 3. Enhancing Telehealth ($1,670,822); 4. Clinical Innovations ($1,771,770) a.

The TECs will provide resources to help Native communities address the four main pillars of the Ending the HIV Epidemi c plan: Diagnose, Treat, Protect, and Respond ( HHS Strategic Plan FY 2022- 2026 Goal 4, Restore Trust and Accelerate Advancements in Science and Research for All , Objective 4.2 Invest in the research enterprise and the scientific workforce to maintain leadership in the development of innovations that broaden our understanding of disease, healthcare, public health, and human services resulting in more effective interventions, treatments, and programs, Objective 4.3 Strengthen surveillance, epidemiology, and laboratory capacity to understand and equitably address diseases and conditions , & Objective 4.4 Improve data collection, use, and evaluation, to increase evidence -based knowledge that leads to better health outcomes, reduced health disparities, and improved social well -being, equity, and economic resilience ). Only current TEC grantees were eligible to apply for the competing supplemental funding under this announcement and had to demonstrate that they have complied with previous terms and conditions of the TEC program. There were two separate, but related no tices in the Federal Register. The first was for those Tribal Epi Centers that do not provide services in the 48 counties or 7 southern states of t he EHE Phase One Jurisdictions. These \"Group A \" applicants could apply for up to $100,000. The second announcement - for \"Group B\" applicants - was for those TECs whose constituency contains one or more of the 48 counties or seven southern states in the Phase One jurisdictions of the EHE.

ETHIC (Ending the HIV/HCV/STI Epidemics in Indian Country) strategic plan - a Congressional IHS set -aside ($1.5 million) In Feb ruary 2021, the IHS National HIV/HCV program submitted a propos al to Office of Infectious Disease and HIV/AIDS Polic y (OIDP ) for $1 .5 million as a Congressionally mandated Tribal set -aside within the Minority HIV/AIDS Fund. OIDP funded the propos al, which will allow AI/AN stakeholders to formulate their own response to HIV in their own communities by incorporating local leadership and knowledge with federal strategic plans and best practices. The planned outcome is an indigenized version of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (2022-2025). This proposed strategic planning project will address national-level strategy planning to Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. by using an environmental scan and community- based assessment framework, working across all Indian H ealth Service Areas and including Urban Indian Organizations. In addition, the FY 2021 final appropriation includes $5 million in Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. for the IHS HIV and Hepatitis C i nitiative , which is the same funding level and purpose as FY 2021. The IHS has conduct ed tribal consultation and urban confer to understand priorities of Tribal and Urban Indian Organization leaders. The IHS will use the EHE funds for tribes, tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations to address diagnoses , and prevention, activities or and treatment activities associated with HIV, HCV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Funds will also support clinical training, including funding for an ECHO model for ongoing case-based training and technical assistance, and will support national infrastructure and a national media campaign for HIV, HCV, and STI diagnosis, prevention, and treatment . In mid -January 2021, IHS released the HIV Primary Care Treatment Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents. The new guideline offers advice for the care of AI/AN persons with HIV and provides (1) guidance on HIV care specific to the AI/AN population, including tuberculosis prevention and diabetes screening; (2) recommendations for treatment utilizing drugs on the IHS Formulary; (3) specific advice on the care of transgender and gender non -binary persons in Indian Country; and (4) a single site resource that consolidates HIV, TB, STI, and primary care advice in one place for I/T/U care providers. The National HIV/HCV Program continues to collaborate with OIDP to ensure IHS pharmacies and patients have the best possible access to PrEP drugs under the Ready Set PrEP (RSP) program. OIDP and IHS have a draft RSP fact sheet for potential AI/AN PrEP users and a draft algorithm for IHS and tribal prescribers to help them navigate the RSP protocols. All of IHS' HIV projects and activities are supported by the Minority HIV/AIDS Fund, and that includes the $2.4 million in cooperative agreements to Tribal Epidemiology Centers. Following are some of their recent achievements: The Albuquerque Area Southwest Tribal Epidemiology Center developed an HIV/AIDS Resource Guide for the 27 tribal communities in New Mexico and southwestern Colorado. The guide contains data on HIV, Hepatitis C Virus, and other sexually transmitted infections in the geographic regions and highlights area resources in the communities that provide HIV testing and PrEP. CJ - 45 The Alaska Native Epidemiology Center executed the Global Network o f People Living with HIV Stigma Index survey in Alaska Native communities. The Urban Indian Health Institute's Trial Epi Center created a survey on HIV and PrEP knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs for staff at 41 urban Indian health organizations. The Okl ahoma Area Tribal Epidemiology Center (OKTEC), in coordination with Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board, launched a campaign to train providers and increase access to PrEP prescribers. The effort now counts more than 50 providers and represents 34 different tribes and tribal facilities. OKTEC and the Cherokee Nation are increasing HIV testing access through a text messaging system already in place and operational. This text messaging system will deliver HIV self -testing kits to doorsteps throughout Indian Country. OKTEC has a goal of a statewide reach by 2021; and a national reaching program by 2022. The Northwest Tribal Epi Center is using race- corrected HIV data from the Washington State Department of Health better to understand the HIV disease burden within NW tribal communities. Northwest Portland will use these data, along with virtual and in -person training on prevention, control, and outbreak investigation, to adopt HIV prevention and control methods on a local level that are de- stigmatizing and culturally appropriate. The IHS National HIV/HCV Program continually searches for ways to help the Area Offices and Service Units achieve their HIV and HCV goals. In the summer of 2020, the IHS National HIV/HCV Program created IHS Area-wide and Service Unit -specific report cards for nationally monitored HIV and HCV screening measures. In August, IHS, in partnership with the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board, released the fourth and final course in the learning module called \"PrEP Navig ator Training for Community and Public Health Staff.\" The learning module is available online. Go to www.ihs.gov and search \"PrEP Navigator.\" The Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board's Healthy Native Youth collaborative launched a Talking is Powe r campaign to help American Indian and Alaska Native parents and caring adults initiate difficult conversations about sexual health topics with their teens and young adults. Caring adults can text the word \"EMPOWER\" to 97779 to receive weekly text messages that include culturally appropriate tips and resources, covering sexual health, pregnancy, HIV/STDs, condoms, and consent. Northwest Portland recently began its second cohort of a six-month Trans & Gender- Affirming Care ECHO designed for IHS, tribal, and urban Indian health care providers. To assess the impact of COVID -19 on our HIV services, in May, August, and December IHS conducted a three-question survey of the clinical leads at our major anti- retroviral therapy programs - specifically those facil ities receiving Minority HIV/AIDS Fund support. In total, we interviewed seven sites. The overall impression is that the impact of COVID has been moderate on the overall health of our patients with HIV as well as the impact on ART. However, many provide rs signaled that the quality of care is suffering and the effects will be manifest in time. A lack of in -person visits means some clinical indicators will go undetected. COVID is causing these HIV medical teams to work in CJ - 46silos more than ever before, and at least one site has reported new HIV patients since COVID -19. Still, one facility noted that resources going towards COVID-19 had actually improved ART adherence, as a proportion of their HIV patient cohort were homeless, but emergency housing was made available as part of the COVID- 19 response to stabilize their housing situation. Hepatitis C V i rus (HCV) infections can result in illness varying in severity from mild (lasting a few weeks) , to serious (a lifelong illness ending in death by liver failure). The likelihood of liver damage is related to the duration and severity of untreated infection. In 2019, CDC reported 1,657 new diagnoses of chronic HCV infection among AI/AN, for a rate of 86.7 per 100,000 the highest of race/ethnicity, and more than double the next highest group (34 per 100,000 among Whites). In the same year, acute HCV infection among AI/AN at 3.6 per 100,000 was more than double the next highest group (1.4 per 100,000 among Whites). 11 The IHS National Patient Information Reporting System (NPIRS) data identifies 29,803 IHS patients from 2005-2015 with HCV, and estimates nearly 200 new cases each year; 53.4 percent were among persons born 1945-1965 12. The overall HCV burden was higher among males than females. This data does not include up to 50 percent of patients who remain undiagnosed. AI/AN people have the largest increase in liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer compared to any other race/ethnic groups. IHS data also identifies fewer than 1,000 HCV patients currently undergoing treatment. HCV death rates among AI/ANs are more than twice the national average compared to other ethnic groups. 13 The CDC and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that all persons born from 1945-1965 should be screened for H CV. The I HS has sustained a steady increase in HCV screening. The national recommendations since 2012 are to screen persons born 1945- 1965, or 'baby boomers.' More recently, the IHS screening recommendations were expanded to all persons 18 years and old er - called 'universal screening' - in large part because of data emphasizing the importance and effectiveness of early diagnosis, treatment, and cure. IHS tracks both the baby boomers and universal screening measures nationally. For boomers, IHS screening coverage increased from 11 percent in 2012 to 66 percent in 2019. These improvements in screening go hand- in-hand wi th changes at I/T/U facilities. Many have added clinical 'reminders' to ensure that patients who have never been tested are offered an HCV test. Just as important, if a patient tests positive, I/T/U facilities can treat in -house, rather than referring out. Drugs for HCV treatment are free to IHS patients and treatment for most patients is simple enough (a course of 1- 3 pills per day, for 8 to 12 weeks) that it can be done in primary care. This course of treatment has more than a 95 percent cure rate. IHS al igned program initiatives with the National Viral Hepatitis Action Plan (NVHAP) 2017- 2020, to eliminate new viral hepatitis infections, increase knowledge of hepatitis diagnoses, improve access to high quality health care and curative treatments, and eliminate stigma and discrimination (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023 Goal 1, To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people, Objective 1.1 Recruit, develop, and retain a 11 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2019 Viral Hepatitis Surveillance Report. https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/SurveillanceRpts.htm .

IHS clinical data shows that screening for HCV among AI/ANs born from 1945-1965, increased from 8 percent in 2012, to 65.6 percent in 2019. This achievement is due in part to the integration of the Department's Strategic Plan Goal 4: Restore Trust and Accelerate Advancements in Science and Research for All through the development of technical support tools like electronic health record (EHR) clinical reminders, publication of IHS policy guidelines for HIV and HCV, and creation of clinical linkages to care (HHS Strategic Plan FY 2022-2026 Goal 4 , Objective 4.3 Strengthen surveillance, epidemiology, and laboratory capacity to understand and equitably address diseases and conditions, & Objective 4.4 Improve data collection, use, and evaluation, to increase evidence-based knowledge that leads to better health outcomes, reduced health disparities, and improved social well-being, equity, and economic resilience ). IHS anticipates higher costs associated with HCV care in FY 2018 and FY 2019 associated with the increased rate of diagnosis (based on increased screening of Baby-Boomers and women of reproductive age) and the substantially high cost of curative medications. In FY 2019, IHS established universal screening for HCV for all patients over the age of 18 years at least once in their lifetime, followed by guideline- based treatment, as appropriate ( IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023 Goal 1, To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appro priate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people, Objective 1.1 Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce, Objective 1.2 Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships , & Objective 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services; HHS Strategic Plan FY 2022 -2026 Goal 1, Protect and Strengthen Equitable Access to High Quality and Affordable Healthcare, Objective 1.2 Reduce costs, improve quality of healthcare services, and ensure access to safe medical devices and drugs Expand safe, high-quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition, & Objective 1.3 Expand equitable access to comprehensive, community- based, innovative, and culturally -competent healthcare services while addressing social determinants of health) . Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) rates continue to rise in Indian Country, and recurrent STDs can increase the likeli hood of HIV transmission. Gonorrhea and syphilis often present as co- morbid conditions with HIV diagnosis, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM). Data show that the incidence rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea among AI/AN people are approximat ely four times that of whites, and AI/AN have the second highest overall rates for both conditions when compared to all other races and ethnicities.14 Regional differences in STDs in Indian Country are also observed, and AI/AN youth and AI/AN women, particularly women of reproductive age, have a disparate and increased STD burden.15 Recent and sustained outbreaks 14 https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats17/minorities.htm 15 https://www.ihs.gov/sites/epi/themes/responsive2017/display_objects/documents/std/Indian_Health_Surveillance_Report_STD_2015. pdf CJ - 48of syphilis have also been observed among AI/AN communities, some related to injection drug and methamphetamine use, and both are recognized risk factors for HIV transmission. Domestic Violence Prevention (DVP ) Program - Domestic and intimate partner violence has a disproportionately large impact on AI/AN communities. According to a 2016 report by the National Institute of Justice ,16 more than four in five AI/AN women (84.3 percent) have experienced violence in their lifetime. In fact, Data from the National Institutes for Justice and the Center for Disease Control show that more than 1.5 million American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced violence, including sexual violence in their lifetimes17 with 66.4 percent of AI/AN reported having experienced psychological aggression by an intimate partner. Intimate partner violence is preventable and many of the projects supported by the DVP program address this public health problem. The DVP program was established in 2015, as a nationally coordinated program that provides culturally appropriate domestic violence and sexual assault prevention and intervention resources to AI/AN communities with a focus on providing trauma informed services. The DVP program supports H HS Goal 3: Strengthen Social Well-Being, Equity, and Economic Resilience, Objective 3.4: Increase safeguards to empower families and communities to prevent and respond to neglect, abuse, and violence, while supporting those who have experienced trauma or violence. In FY 2021, a total of 83 DVP projects completed projects that focus ed on the following objectives : 1. Build Tribal, Urban Indian Health Programs, and Federal capacity to provide coordinated community responses to AI/AN victims of domestic and sexual violence, 2. Increase access to domestic and sexual violence prevention, advocacy, crisis intervention, and behavioral health services for AI/AN victims and their families, 3. Promote trauma- informed services for AI/AN victims of domestic and sexual violence and their fam ilies, 4. Offer health care provider and community education on domestic violence and sexual violence, 5. Respond to the health care needs of AI/AN victims of domestic and sexual violence, and 6. Incorporate culturally appropriate practices and/or faith -based services for AI/AN victims of domestic and sexual violence. DVP program achievements between FY 2018-2019 in clude an approximate 94,454 service contacts. DVP program projects focused on coordinated community responses, advocacy, forensic healthcare, integration of traditional healing, faith -based and culturally competent services. By the fourth year, projects experienced an expansion of behavioral health and case management services delivered to victims of domestic violence and intimate partner viole nce. The majority of projects ( 80.5 percent ) have implemen ted one evidence -based practice. As the DVP program emphasizes the importan ce of community and culturally based, projects, recent data shows that 17,407 individ uals received cultural ly-tailored services while 1,233 received a form of faith -based services. Disseminating lessons learned and best practices is a priority and prior to the pandemic IHS hosted a platform for monthly collaborative learning session. In FY 2021, IHS converted these efforts to spotlight videos available 16 released a series webinars focused on prevention, services and resources for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. In addition, these funds support Forensic Health Care (FHC) services within IHS HQ. The Forensic Health Care program established in 2009 has developed multiple policies within the Indian Health Manual to increase recognition of and prevention of sexual as sault and child maltreatment (all forms including sexual abuse). The FHC team works wit h the DVP program to enhance intimate partner violence efforts , and strategy and resources to address human trafficking . The FHC team provides subject matter expertise and high -quality staff training, assistance to local facilities to create or sustain appropriate acute forensic care services, and strengthen on- going comprehensive services that enhance survivor healing. In FY 2020, IHS released a trauma informed care policy and has worked to implement the principles of trauma informed care to ensure its system understands the prevalence and impact of trauma, facilitates healing, avoids re -traumatization, and focuses on strength and resilience. Through the DVP /FHC program, more than 2,108 health professionals received training in Trauma Informed Car with projects offering a combined estimated 138 trainings . In addition, the FHC program has established a strong partnership with the International Association of Forensic Nurses. The services provided through this agreement include didactic and clinical forensic examination courses, quarterly educational webinars, and technical assistance to sexual assault programs operating within the I/T/U system. National Community Health Aide Program (CHAP): provides a network of health aides trained to support licensed health professionals while providing direct health care, health promotion, and disease prevention services. These providers work within a referral relationship under the supervision of licensed clinical providers that includes clinics, service units, and hospitals. The program increases access to direct health services, includin g inpatient and outpatient visits through a focus on primary, emergency, behavioral, and dental health to equip Tribal communities with a network that expands the system of care and aids in the mobilization of healthcare in America's most rural and remote communities where access to care is few and far in between. In 2016, the IHS begun the efforts to expand the program nationally and in July 2020, the IHS announced the policy that formally established the national CHAP which sees to the use of health aides in the field of primary care, behavioral health, and oral health. In January 2022, the Division of Clinical and Community Services hired the Community Health Aide (CHA) Specialist to support the development of the CHA workforce.

Maternal Health All federal hospitals providing planned birth services have earned the \"Baby Friendly\" designation by Baby -Friendly USA . Comprehensive breastfeeding education and continued lactation support are mainstays of this designation. The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) designation ensures education is provided during prenatal care and lactation support is routinely offered throughout the hospital stay and postpartum. IHS further promotes breastfeeding opportunities through the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative, building organizational capacity and CJ - 50practice- based resou rces, developing partnerships to advance breastfeeding, and incorporating breastfeeding into its robust public health programs. Breastfeeding education has also been included in many trainings offered to IHS, Tribal, and Urban Health staff, including those offered in partnership with the ACOG Committee on American Indian and Alaska Native Women's Health. Baby -Friendly designation naturally leads to education and support of breastfeeding to become engrained in daily operations of the hospitals. Education on early warning signs, how to recognize these warning signs, when to return to care, whether that should be for routine or emergent care, and information on a large network of resources available for new mothers are important pieces of this breastfeeding su pport post-discharge . In addition to efforts specifically related to maintaining the BFHI designation, IHS continues to monitor Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) rates and several sites have initiated intensive QI projects around breastfeeding. IHS has built partnerships between Tribes and the AIM Community Care Initiative (AIM CCI), and has enjoyed a long standing partnership with the American Academy of Pediatrics -Committee on Native American Child Health (CONACH) and works closely with these entities in implementation of any recommendations to improve infant feeding outcomes and resultant child health indicators. IHS partners with Tribes, urban Indian organizations, and local and state governments in order to ensure comprehensive, culturally appropriate lactation services are provided for the American Indian and Alaskan Native women and families served. One example includes linking patients with postpartum resources available to them after discharge, which include a variety of ways to access support, online, by phone, or in person including home visitation programs. Postpartum visits are also offered by public health/community health programs in many communities; offering 1:1 assistance and support, in home, which helps to remove access to car e barriers such as transportation or childcare for other children, and also helps to ensure cultural sensitivity for those patients practicing traditional beliefs and customs surrounding childbirth. Several certified lactation consultants and counselors are employed by IHS, and sites have offered incentives for this continued education and certification. Referrals can be placed by the public health/community health programs for additional lactation support or other resources as needed. IHS offers resources about breastfeeding promotion and support on the Baby Friendly webpage . This public facing page is available on the general website for patients, staff and other interested individuals to access freely. The page includes information about breastfeeding promotion and support, standard of care, breastfeeding benefits, common problems, clinical challenges, and a toolkit on providing education on breastfeeding. T he Baby Friendly designation efforts support IHS Strategic Plan Goal One: To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people, and HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2: Safeguard and Improve National and Global Health Conditions and Outcomes. Alzheimer's In FY 2021, IHS received $5 million to address Alzheimer's and related cognitive health issues in American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities. On March 31, 2021, the IHS initiated Tribal Consultation and Urban Confer on the FY 2021 appropriations seeking specific feedback on priorities necessary to implement and build the Alzheimer's Grant Program fo r maximum success in Federal, Tribal, and Urban In dian Organization facilities. The IHS hosted several Tribal Consultation and Urban Confer conference calls with Tribal and Urban Indian Organization Leaders in March, April, and May 2021. The IHS will utilize the FY 2021 funds in FY 2022 due to the import ance of Tribal Consultation and Urban Confer. The Alzheimer's Grant CJ - 51Program will include funding for Tribes, Tribal Organizations, IHS Direct Service programs working directly with Tribes to address Alzhiemer's disease and related dementia, and Urban Indian Organizations. Funding will support a national media campaign, clinical training, caregiver coach training, and provide national infrastructure to support the new Initiative.

COVID-19 The COVID -19 pandemic has disproportionately affected American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations across the country. Data indicates AI/ANs have infection rates over 3.5 times higher than non- Hispanic whites, are over four times more likely to be ho spitalized as a result of COVID -19, and have higher rates of mortality at younger ages than non- Hispanic whites. The IHS continues to work closely with our Tribal partners, Urban Indian Organizations, state, and local public health officials to coordinate a comprehensive public health response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. During FY 2020 and FY 2021, the Indian health care system modified health care delivery and adapted programming to address COVID-19. This budget narrative may include examples of how care or programming was adapted to address COVID - 19. Please refer to the Overview of Agency Performance for additional information about the IHS COVID -19 Response. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year $3,365,792 ,000 ($12,967,278) TRIBAL SHARES H&HC funds are subject to tribal shares and are transferred to Tribes when they assume responsibility for operating associated programs, functions, services, and activities, unless otherwise specified in the annual appropriations bill. A portion of the ove rall H&HC budget line is reserved for inherently federal functions and is therefore retained by IHS to perform the basic operational services of the Agency. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2023 budget submission for Hospitals and Health Clinics is $ 3.4 billion , which is $967 m illion above 2022 Base Funding of $2.4 billion - suppo rts the largest portion of clinica l care at IHS and Tribal health facilities, including salari es and benefits for hos pital/clini c administra tion; sala ries and benefits for physici ans, nur ses, a nd ancillary sta ff; pharm aceuticals; and m edical suppli es. These funds make up the lump sum r ecurring base distribution to t he Ar eas each fiscal y ear. Funding to support IHS facilities to promote efficient, effective, high quality care to the AI/AN population is also included in the base. FY 2023 Funding Increase of $967 m illion includes : C urrent Services : +$118 million for current services including: P ay Costs +$ 67 million - to fund pay increases for federal and Tribal employees, of whom approximately 90 percent are working at the service unit level providing health care and related services. I nflation +$8 million - to fund inflationary costs of providing health care services. P opulation Growth +$43 million - to fund the additional service need s arising from the growing AI/AN population. The IHS projects a population growth rate of 1.8 percent in CY 2023 based on state births and deaths data. S taffing for New Facilities : +$68 million - these funds will support staffing and operating costs for new and replacement projects listed below. Funding for new/renovated healthcare facilities allows IHS to expand provision of health care in those areas where capacity has been expanded to address hea lth care needs. The following table displays this request. New Facilities Amount FTE/Tribal Positions Naytahwaush Health Center (JV), Naytahwaush, MN $9,101 NEACC (Salt River) Health Center, Scottsdale, AZ $10,900 ,000 84 Phoenix Indian Medical Center Central, Phoenix, AZ $676,000 9 Ysleta Del Sur Health Center (JV), El Paso, TX $2,673,000 23 Alternative Rural Health Center, Dilkon, AZ $12,181,000 Elbowoods Memorial Health Center (JV), New Town, ND $3,06 4,000 10 North Star Health Clinic (JV), Seward, AK $3,500,000 20 Rapid City Indian Health Service Hospital, Rapid City, SD $25,912,000 232 Grand Total: $68,007,000 540 G eneral Program Increase: +$215 million to expand access to direct health care services. These resources will support efforts to reduce health disparities and improve the overall health status for American Indians and Alaska Natives by increasing the availability of health care services in Indian Country. This funding level will support an estimated 40,536 inpatient admissions and 15,825,423 outpatient visits at IHS and Tribal facilities in FY 2023. N ational Community Health Aide Program : +$20 million to support the expansion of CHAP to the lowe r 48 states. These additional resources would support the training, certifying, and hiring of health aides, as well as national program management activities. A ssessments and Other Related Costs: +$27 million, to offset the increasing costs of central CJ - 53assessments charged to the IHS since FY 2014. To address the growing costs of shared services at HHS, the IHS has delayed hiring and investments in critical systems, working to shield direct health care services to the maximum extent possible. However, the IH S is now at a point where it can no longer sacrifice oversight and management of national health programs to absorb these rising costs. I ndian Health Care Improvement Fund Consolidation and Funding Increase : +$31 7 million to consolidate funding for the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund into the Hospitals and Health Clinics funding line (+$74 million), and increase funding (+$243 million), to provide additional health services and address resource disparities across the Indian health system. Prior to 2 018, funding for the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund was appropriated in the Hospitals and Health Clinics funding line. In FY 2018, Congress created a separate budget line for the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund. As a result, these funds are now appropriated, accounted for, monitored, and allocated from two separate locations in the IHS budget. Consolidating the funds into the Hospitals and Health Clinics funding line will allow for a more streamlined approach to managing and allocating these resour ces. While these resources would be realigned to the Hospitals and Health Clinics PPA, IHS would continue to distribute them under the existing Indian Health Care Improvement Fund formula. E limination of HIV, Hepatitis C, and Sexually Transmitted Diseases: +$47 million - to support efforts to diagnose all HIV -positive IHS patients as early as possible after infection, treat those living with HIV rapidly to achieve and sustain viral suppression, and protect individuals at high risk of HIV using pre -exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). These resources will also help the IHS to effectively identify, treat, and prevent related conditions and risks for HIV infection, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) and sexually transmitted disease (STD) infections, and respond rapidly to growing HIV clusters to prevent new HIV infections. R ates of STDs other than HIV also continue to rise in Indian country and can increase risk for HIV transmission. Additionally, IHS serves a population that is disproportionately affected by HCV \u2014the AI/AN population has more than twice the rate of HCV incidence and nearly three times the rate of HCV -related mortality as the general U.S. population (CDC 2018). Without concerted intervention that includes expanded HIV, STD, and HCV prevention, testing, and treatment, along with increased clinical and public health resourcing and infrastructure, including associated pharmaceuticals and data generation and analysis capacity , rates of AI/AN HIV, STDs, and HCV will likely continue to increase in FY 2023 and beyond. Additi onal health statistics about these priority diseases are provided in the program accomplishments section of this narrative. The additional $47 million requested above FY 2022 would: Expand patient screening and treatment for those living with HIV, STDs, and HCV, Provide targeted PrEP and expedited partner therapy to those at greater risk for acquiring HIV and other STDs, Effectively screen and treat those patients living with HIV and HCV, Sufficiently staff and resource oversight activities to ensure success, Bolster public health surveillance and data infrastructure, Evaluate these efforts, and Support outreach, education, and training. The proposed funding level directly supports IHS's efforts to provide high quality health care CJ - 54across the Indian health system, as well as IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023 Goal 1, To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to Americ an Indian and Alaska Native people, Objective 1.1 Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce, Objective 1.2 Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships, & Objective 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services; HHS Strategic Plan FY 2022-2026 Goal 1, Protect and Strengthen Equitable Access to High Quality and Affordable Healthcare, Objective 1.2 Reduce costs, improve quality of healthcare services, and ensure access to safe medical devices and drugs Expand safe, high-quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition, Objective 1.3 Expand equitable access to compreh ensive, community-based, innovative, and culturally -competent healthcare services while addressing social determinants of health & Objective 1.5 Bolster the health workforce to ensure delivery of quality services and care). IHS will concentrate efforts on building up its HIV and HCV infrastructure in the 12 Area Offices and Service Units. Mat ernal Health : +$4 million - to expand the reach of this HHS- wide initiative in Indian Country. The new resources will: o S upport preventive, perinatal, and postpartum care, o Address the news of pregnant women with opioid or other substance use disorder, o Improve quality services and health outcomes to reduce maternal morbidity. Specifically, these funds will support expended efforts identified through Tribal Consult ation and Urban Confer, and increase the number of maternal case managers in IHS and Tribal Health Programs to expand access to evidence- based training for health care professionals and patients. P artially Sustain American Rescue Plan Investments: +$77 million - to partially sustain the ARPA investments that were provided to expand the public health workforce in Indian Country. T he American Rescue Plan Act provided a historic investment in public health workforce activities for American Indian and Alaska Native communities. The IHS distributed the $240 million appropriated in the ARPA to all IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian Heath programs. However, the ARPA appropriation provided one-time, non-recurring funding to support mental health and substance a buse prevention and treatment services. Ongoing resources are necessary to ensure that IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian health programs do not have to significantly reduce public health workforce activities as the one- time ARPA resources are expended. N urse Preceptorship Program : +$1 million to create a new program to provide training, development, mentoring, and other on-the- job supports to improve placement rates of first year nurses in IHS and Tribal Health Programs. A nalysis indicates that the IHS has di fficulty placing newly -graduated nurses in IHS and Tribal health programs, despite vacancy rates in the mid -20 percent range for nursing professions. IHS and Tribal health programs prefer to hire nurses with on-the- job experience to nurses who have just completed their studies, and are joining the IHS either through the Scholarship or Loan Repayment programs. CJ - 55 This new program will improve placement rates for recently graduated nurses with Bachelors of Science in Nursing (BSN) and Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) by providing on the job development, training, and mentorship. Many IHS and Tribal health programs have a critical need for nurses, but do not have the resources or the capacity to provide the additional supports necessary to ensure a high level of success for recently graduated nurses. This new program will create that infrastructure at the local level, in partnership with federal, tribal, and relevant state entities. The proposed funding level will support IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 1: To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN people, Objective 1.1 Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce, Objective 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services ; and HHS Strategic Plan FY 2022-2026, Goal 2: Safeguard and Improve National and Global Health Conditions and Outcomes, Objective 2.1 Improve capabilities to predict, prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from emergencies, disasters, and threats across the nation and globe, Objective 2.2 Protect individuals, families, and communities from infectious disease and non-communicable disease through equitable access to effective, innovative, readily available diagnost ics, treatments, therapeutics, medical devices, and vaccines, and Objective 2.3 Enhance promotion of healthy behaviors to reduce occurrence and disparities in preventable injury, illness, and death. Funds will support: C ontract or IAA with Established Academic Preceptor Program . Leveraging an established program would allow for rapid implementation of the applicable infrastructure, training, and ladder toward advance certifications. One example of a similar program is the CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service program, which was established in 1951, and has a unique combination of onthejoblearning and service. T wo New FTE . These positions will oversee, monitor, and evaluat e program activities. T here are currently no Nurse Consultant positions at HQ to oversee Nurse Recruitment or a Nurse Preceptorship program. Fully funding 2 FTE positions for a Nurse Consultant for Recruitment and a Nurse Consultant for a Preceptorship Program would allow for these individuals to focus more discriminately on newly hi red Registered Nurses and Advance Practice Nurses onboarding and preparation via preceptorship program, and nurse recruitment and retention; particularly in rural areas, or those areas lacking a sufficient nursing workforce. One FTE would establish and r un the preceptorship program and one FTE would reestablish the link to recruiting and monitor ing through the Nurse Education Center for Indians (NECI) program and oversee the IHS Nursing Scholarship recipients (for sections 103, 104, 105, and 112 programs). The 2 FTEs would actively work with other OPDIVs to leverage preceptorship opportunities, monitor and track success rates, serve CJ - 56as the COR when needed for contracts with established academic preceptor programs and nurse recruitment and retention activities, and leverage what is offered in the federal, public and private sectors with organizations like HRSA, Uniformed Services University, John Hopkins University, etc. E mergency Preparedness : +$10 million - to support emergency preparedness personnel, training, and activities across the IHS. P rior to and during the COVID- 19 pandemic, IHS has implemented emergency preparedness with limited staff dedicated to these activities. As funding through state -level healthcare preparedness grants has waned, most IHS Area Offices and many facility level emergency preparedness programs rely solely on existing IHS staff performing emergency preparedness as collateral duties. The HQ emergency preparedness position has been vacant for several years, only two IHS Areas have emergency preparedness positions (Nashville and Navajo), and only one IHS hospital has a dedicated position for emergency preparedness. The IHS is led and staffed by a wide range of dedicated healthcare and public health professionals. These staff are highly trained in their areas of expertise, but have traditionally had little emergency preparedness training and experience. Dedicated resources both internally and through contractual support would serve as force multipliers supporting and coordinating IHS staff to undertake their essential duties. An a dditional +14 FTEs would help to identify strategic and tactical level needs, and would then have time and resources to pursue and ensure resolution. These resources build on the investment initially made through the American Rescue Plan Act. The proposed funding level will support IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 1: To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN people, Objective 1.1 Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce, Objective 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services. This funding will also help IHS Emergency Preparedness meet the HHS Strategic Plan FY 2022 -2026, Goal 2: Safeguard and Improve National and Global Health Conditions and Outcomes, Objective 2.1 Improve capabilities to predict, prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from emergencies, disasters, and threats across the nation and globe, Objective 2.2 Protect individuals, families, and communitie s from infectious disease and non-communicable disease through equitable access to effective, innovative, readily available diagnostics, treatments, therapeutics, medical devices, and vaccines, and Objective 2.3 Enhance promotion of healthy behaviors to reduce occurrence and disparities in preventable injury, illness, and death. E mergency Medical Services: +$ 20 million - to address critical needs for Emergency Medical Services in Indian Country, where stagnating funding creates difficulties in maintaining equipment, retaining staff, and other challenges. EMS programs provide important services in communities to respond to injuries and other acute situations, as well as providing patient transport to higher level of care. T here are over 100 IHS and Tribal EMS programs nationwide providing services in American Indian and Alaska Native communities. Funding for these programs has not kept pace with the growing needs of the populations served. CJ - 57During the COVID- 19 response, EMS programs played a vital role i n responding to calls for respiratory distress and providing critical patient transport to get patients to the appropriate level of care. EMS programs also provide vaccinations, COVID -19 testing, and assist with infusion services as appropriate for EMTs, AEMTs, and Paramedics. In this way, EMS programs served as a force multiplier during the pandemic. In addition, EMS programs were able to provide treat and release services to alleviate overloading of Emergency Departments and inpatient facilities under the Public Health Emergency. The presented funding amount supports IHS Strategic Goal One: To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people, and the HHS Strategic Plan FY 2022-2026 Goal 2: Safeguard and Improve National and Global Health Conditions and Outcomes and Goal 5: Advance Strategic Management to Build Trust, Transparency, and Accountability, Objective 5.3 Uphold effective and innovative human capital resource management resulting in an engaged, diverse workforce with the skills and competencies to accomplish the HHS mission. IHS and Tribal EMS programs face two main challenges: 1. Stagnating funding levels . Funding amounts established for individual IHS and Tribal EMS programs have stagnated overtime, making it increasingly difficult to recruit and retain staff, upgrade ambulances and other emergency medical equipment, and meet CMS Conditions of Participat ion for accreditation. In some cases, Tribal Health Programs have discussed relinquishing direct operation of these programs to the IHS due to low funding levels, even though the IHS does not have additional resources for the operation of EMS programs. 2. Conversion of inpatient facilities . Many IHS and Tribal facilities operate in rural and remote locations. As some inpatient facilities are no longer able to maintain full Emergency Department (ED) services due to low patient census and increased ISDEAA contracting and compacting at multi- tribe facilities, the need for patient transport grows. The next closest full service ED might be many miles or several hours away, straining the already limited capacity of existing EMS programs. For example, many communities lose access to critical EMS services when an ambulance and its crew transport a patient to a facility that could be more than 3 hours away. Additional resources are necessary to address the many issues caused by both of these challenges. For example, the requested funding level would support multiple crews in individual EMS programs that could handle community emergencies and provide necessary patient transport without a gap in coverage. D ivision of Graduate Medical Education : +$4 million - to expand and support Graduate Medical Education programs to create a pipeline for future physicians to address longstanding vacancy issues at IHS. C urrently, two physician residency programs are in development at IHS- operated health programs. One program is at the Northern Navajo Medical Center at Shiprock, partnered with the University of New Mexico. The other is in the Rosebud Service Unit in the Great Plains Area, partnered with Mass General Hospital. In both cases, the partner academic affiliates have received HRSA rural residency program development planning grants. Once established, these residency programs will support recruitment and retention efforts of high quality health care professionals in Indian Country. CJ - 58 The IHS must establish consistent pol icies and procedures for these programs, and provide appropriate oversight of these activities. An Agency-wide approach will allow for growth at other IHS service units, and will support consistency in how the IHS handles important business functions, lik e access to the IHS Electronic Health Record, and onboarding of medical residents. Funds are also necessary to develop these programs in the relevant IHS health programs, including for faculty development and other critical activities. The VA has a large Graduate Medical Education office, and these resources would help the IHS to develop a small, targeted effort. In addition to establishing the Office of Graduate Medical Education Programs, these funds will support the development of residency programs in up to four facilities per year. D ivision of Telehealth : +$10 million - to provide resources to appropriately manage and oversee a comprehensive telehealth program at the IHS that would expand telehealth services, develop governance structures, provide tr aining to users, and integrate with clinical services. T he IHS is the only major Federal healthcare organization that does not have a dedicated office or division to support policy, standardization, and coordination for enterprise wide telehealth. This activity would provide resources to appropriately manage and oversee a comprehensive telehealth program at the Agency level that could expand telehealth services nationwide. This new Division would also incorporate the activities of the IHS Tele - Behavioral Health Center for Excellence (TBHCE), which is provides direct services and on-line education focused specifically on behavioral and mental health. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the IHS significantly expanded the use of Telehealth to sustain the provision of health care services while many facilities had to reduce their service provision and hours to prevent the further spread of COVID. In April 2020, IHS expanded the use of an Agency -wide video conferencing platform that allows for telehealth on almost any internet-connected device and in any setting, including patients' homes. Around the same time, IHS also permitted the emergency use of certain commonly available mobile apps to enable the provision of services remotely while minimizing exposure risk to both patients and staff. These actions, along with the actions taken by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to allow payment for previously non- billable services, made it possible for IHS to dramatically increase our use of telehealth from an average of under 1,300 visits per month in early 2020 to a peak of over 40,000 per month in June and July of that year. More recent data suggests a plateau of around 30,000 monthly telehealth visits. It is important to note that on average, about 80 percent of telehealth encounters across IHS are conducted using audio only, largely related to the limite d availability of technologies and bandwidth capacity in the communities we serve across the country. IHS is currently working to implement an additional cloud-based telehealth platform to complement our existing solutions and distribute d COVID -19 suppleme ntal telehealth funds to sites for equipment and devices to improve access for more interactive telehealth encounters. C ancer Prevention and Intervention Initiative : +$8 million - to develop a coordinated public health and clinical cancer prevention initiative to implement best practices and prevention strategies to address incidence of cancer and mortality among AI/ANs. While there have been advances in cancer detection and treatment, certain ethnic groups continue to experience disparities. For example , the incidence of all cancer combined have decreased among males for all ethnic groups, but rates did not decrease or have remained stable for certain types of cancer among AI/AN populations. CDC reported that lung, colorectal, liver, and kidney CJ - 59cancers are much higher among AI/AN people compared to non- Hispanic White people in the U.S. These funds would support: o Additional FTE to develop and implement multi-level and multidisciplinary approaches to increase preventive screenings for early detection and treatment, to increase educational outreach, and to improve access to cessation services. o Competitive cooperative agreements to Tribes, Tribal Organizations, and Urban Indian Organizations to support innovative and culturally relevant promotion of preventive screenings, educational outreach, address modifiable behavioral risk factors (commercial tobacco use, poor diet, and phys ical inactivity), integrate client/provider reminders system, implement e- referrals to cessation services, and implement policies that are supportive of healthy lifestyle. o Establish Clinical/Community Demonstration Projects with the IHS Improved Patient Care (IPC) and community health programs (public health nursing, health education, CHRs) to implement evidence- based interventions to increase preventive screenings, enhance referrals for follow -up and/or treatment. o T rainings and Best Practice Sharing to plan, coordinate, and provide cancer prevention and control trainings to clinical and community health personnel, to share best practices/strategies, and develop self-paced training modules. Target audience include physicians, nurses, radiologist, heal th promoters, public health nurses, health education, CHRs behavioral health and other disciplines using virtual platform, online modules, IHS Telehealth webinars, and national/regional conferences and meetings. o I nformation Technology investments to create bundled provider reminders into the Electronic Health Record, integrate e- referrals to cessation services, and integrate client reminders into the Patient Health Records. O ffice of Quality : +$10 million - to support activities that ensure high quality service provision and that CMS accreditation standards are met including a mock survey program, gap analyses for at -risk facilities, quality measures and reporting enhancements, training on medical quality issues, and expanded risk management activities. I HS has made significant progress in improving the quality of patient care delivery and infection prevention and control. However, significant gaps remain related to achieving and sustaining a highly reliable system that best meets the needs of AI/AN peop le. The IHS organizational structure has historically depended largely on local efforts to comply with quality standards. While successful at producing care tailored to local needs and circumstances, system -wide improvement has been uneven. A well -resour ced national program focused on establishing and supporting a unified vision for quality and safety in health care is critical to creating the necessary consistency in excellence across the IHS's 24 hospitals and 31 health centers. While important progres s had been made, sustainable change cannot be maintained without the resources to train and support the workforce and monitor implementation of system redesign and improvement practices. In addition, the GAO and OIG have recommended that the IHS establish a central owner quality oversight to improve accountability and compliance (OEI-06-14-00010: More Monitoring Needed to Ensure Quality Care; OEI-06-14-00011: Longstanding Challenges CJ - 60Warrant Focused Attention to Support Quality Care; OEI-06-19- 00330: Indian Health Service Has Strengthened Patient Protection Policies but Must Fully Integrate Then Into Practice and Organizational Culture; OEI -06-16-00390: Organizational Challenges to Improving Quality of Care in Indian Health Service Hospitals; GAO-17-181: Actions Needed to Improve Oversight of Quality of Care; and, GAO-16-333: Actions Needed to Improve Oversight of Patient Wait Times). Bolstering the resources to enable continuous organizational quality improvement is crucial. At the root of many of the past failures within the IHS are core organizational challenges that if identified, tested, and corrected, will create local and system -wide change. If such a program is not funded, IHS will remain at risk for future failures. The structure of the IHS appropriation and statutory requirements governing the use of third-party collections make it extremely difficult to make needed investments in quality, oversight, and compliance activities without additional appropriated resources. Without the resources to suppor t these national efforts, the IHS remains at risk of regression, recreating past challenges with unable to address future challenges. The program aligns with IHS Strategic Plan Goal Two, To promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization communities; IHS Strategic Plan Goal Three To Strengthen IHS program management and operations; and, the HHS Strategic Plan Goal One, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high-quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition and the HHS Strategic Plan Goal One, Strategic Objective 1.2, Expand safe, high -quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition; and, the HHS Strategic Plan Goal One, Strategic Objective 1.3 , Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choices of care and service options. Requested funding for the Office of Quality would: Support expanded testing, mock surveying, training, education, and consultation activities with federal hospitals, critical access hospitals, behavioral health centers, and ambulatory care health centers ($1 0 million). o Implement mock survey program: Conduct program across IHS facilities of mock surveys, follow-up, and resurvey. These surveys would ensure early id entification of accreditation issues and maintain survey readiness by IHS facilities. This would allow IHS management to provide critical resources and oversight to avoid more significant problems developing. o Provide gap analyses for at -risk facilities: Fund several more in- depth gap analyses at key IHS facilities to identify accreditation and other quality issues, and then fund the development of a corrective action plan and work with the facility leadership to implement and test improvements. o Training and Education: Funding would support the development and delivery of training/education (virtual and onsite) to IHS's federal system on CJ - 61medical quality issues to ensure consistency in health care quality across the agency. Training would focus on: Improvi ng local oversight of quality assurance and performance improvement. Performance improvement focused on monitoring and enhancing patient safety. Methods for improving experience of care. Provide training and resources to support compliance with required certifications/accreditations. Where requested, provide similar services to Tribal and Urban Indian Organizations. o Develop quality measures and reporting enhancements to existing information systems, to better leverage existing investments: Funds will be used to design, refine/test, and implement quality measures, including making changes to existing data systems to automate collection/reporting. In addition, work with existing IHS data systems, including Qlik reporting to enhance quality and oversight repor ting. o Early integration of quality reporting/metrics in the IHS's Electronic Health Record modernization efforts: Requested funds would support contract hours, within the existing EHR project or with an outside contractor to ensure quality reporting/metr ics are integrated within the EHR modernization project. This contractor would provide a technical bridge between the IT project staff and the programmatic staff within the Office of Quality. As sites are \"rolled out\" within the new project, these funds would support site visits and user acceptance training on quality/reporting metric -specific issues, separate from the overall EHR implementation. Expanded risk management activities, including process mapping and implementing system improvements to promote safety and risk mitigation o Identify high- risk activities that undermine the quality of care within IHS facilities, map process, and design/test system improvements. N ational Business Improvement Center : +$3 million - to establish a new program to ensure proper monitoring and management of the revenue cycle and purchase of care, ensure compliance with internal controls to maximize revenue at the national level, and quickly identify threats to the revenue cycle and proactively assist Areas/facilities to mitigate adverse outcomes. I HS revenue has grown tremendously in the past decade from $711 million in 2010 to nearly $1.1 billion in FY 2020, an increase of 55 percent . As these collections have grown, so has the need for additional staff and capacity for effective monitoring and oversight of these public resources. CJ - 62The need for increased oversight and follow up by IHS was identified by the General Accountability Office (GAO) in a 2010 study. GAO found that IHS natio nal monitoring activities were inadequate to ensure Area Office and Service Unit compliance with billing, collection, and debt management policies and procedures. In February 2021, GAO returned to review the third party collection process, specifically on IHS policies, guidance, and oversight. The IHS has established policies and procedures for billing and collecting revenue from private insurers that are consistent with federal standard business processes for billings and collections. IHS lacks the necessary staff capacity to provide regular and consistent review and updates to these policies. Additional staff would enable IHS to update the policies and procedures more frequently and further assist the IHS Area Offices and Service Units in developing local policies and procedures to supplement the national guidelines. The 2010 GAO Report also recommended improvements in analyzing available data and further developing tools to monitor and manage billings and collections, as well as developing a risk -based approach using the information obtained from the new data sources to prioritize which IHS Service Units receive future on -site compliance reviews. These funds would similarly su pport those efforts. Specifically, these funds would support staffing costs and contractual services. The NBIC will provide training and technical assistance to Area Office and Service Unit staff on Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance programs, an d how to best negotiate lower rates for health care services that are contracted to the private sector. This training will be instrumental in increasing the skill sets of the employees that directly impact managing contract health fee negotiation and expanding alternate resources. Many contracted health services and third -party collection features are unique to the Indian Health system, and the training will be specifically designed for Indian Health programs. On -site technical assistance will be offered on the same subjects.

Cooperative Agreements PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Service (IHS) Tribal Epidemiology Center (TEC) Program was first authorized by Congress in fiscal year (FY) 1992. The IHS program supporting TECs was first funded in FY 1996. The program was founded to develop public health infrastructure by augmenting existing Tribal organizations with expertise in epidemiology and public health via Epidemiology Centers. Funding is distributed to the TECs through cooperative agreements to Tribes and Tribal organizations such as Indian Health Boards. The TECs play a critical role in IHS' overall public health infrastructure. Operating within Tribal organizations and governments, TECs are uniquely positioned to provide support to local Tribal disease surveillance and control programs, and assess the effectiveness of public health programs. All TECs monitor the health status of their constituent Tribes, produce a variety of reports annually or bi-annually that describe activities and progress towards public health goals, and provide support to Tribes who self - govern their health programs. The TEC program funds eleven TECs that provide comprehensive geographic coverage for all I HS administrative areas and one additional TEC serving American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations residing in major urban centers nationally. The IHS Division of Epidemiology and Disease Prevention (DEDP) functions as the national coordinating center and provides technical support and guidance to TECs. The DEDP and TECs collect, analyze, interpret, and disseminate health information in addition to identifying diseases to target for intervention, suggesting strategies, and evaluating the effecti veness of implemented health interventions. The TEC Program supports Tribal communities by providing technical training and assistance in applied public health practice and prevention- oriented research, and by promoting public health caree r pathways for T ribal members. In FY 2021, a significant portion of TEC activities were devoted to supporting Tribes in confronting the COVID-19 public health emergency. Annually, approximately 90 percent or more of the TEC Program budget is distributed to TECs through cooperative agreements based on a 5- year competitive award cycle. In the current 5- year award cycle CJ - 69beginning FY 2021, the average annual award across all 12 TECs w as $ $699,073. The current funding award cycle extends through FY 2025. The TECs are fundamental to the IHS' partnership with Tribes through support for essential epidemiology and public health functions that complement direct healthcare services. Independent TEC goals are set as directed by their constituent Tribes and healt h boards. The DEDP tracks these goals and objectives as written in their cooperative agreements ( e.g., surveillance of disease and control programs; collecting epidemiological data for use in determining health status of Tribal communities). The TEC funds provide critical support in strengthening the collaborative partnerships among the 12 TECs ' constituent AI/AN communities as a part of the Agency's work to address the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2 019-2023, Goal 1, Objective 1.2 ( Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships) and the HHS Strategic Plan 20 22-2024 Objective 4.3 (Strengthen surveillance, epidemiology, and laboratory capacity to understand and equitably address diseases and conditions ). The work of the TECs to collect data relat ing to, and monitor progress made toward meeting, each of the health status objectives of the IHS, Indian Tribes, Tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations in each IHS service area is an essential part of meeting the IHS Goal 1, Objective 1.3, S trategy 7 ( Reduce health disparities in the AI/AN population) by highlighting disparities in the AI/AN population so they can be reduced through Public Health efforts. This includes the significant and disproportionate health impact s of the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic, the Opioid crisis in Indian Country, and the epidemic of HIV/AIDS, HCV, and sexually transmitted diseases in AI/AN communities. Significant improvements in reducing the burden of each of these and many other health disparities in this population strongly supports the HHS Goal to Safeguard and Improve National and Global Health Conditions and Outcomes . PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The TEC funds provide critical support in strengthening the collaborative partnerships among the 12 TECs , AI/AN communities, and the IHS (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 1, Objective 1.2) . Below are key TEC activities. Data Projects that Engage Local Resources Data generated locally and analyzed by TECs enable Tribes to evaluate Tribal and community- specific health status for planning the needs of their Tribal membership. Immediate feedback is provided to the local data systems and leads to improvements in Indian health data overall. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (Section 130) includes language t hat designates the TECs as public health authorities in regards to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. This designation permits TECs to access IHS -generated data sets used to support various public h ealth activities. Improving Public Health Data Quality and Reporting for AI/AN Communities In public health administrative records, AI/AN people are often misidentified as another race, called racial misclassification. Racial misclassification occurs mo re often in AI/AN records than in records from other racial groups, which often makes it hard to accurately measure and describe the health status of AI /AN people using traditional public health data. A specific effort by the Urban Indian Health Institute TEC recently drew attention to the omission or misclassification of American Indian and Alaska Native people in current standard data collection practices by many federal, state, and local entities in the report entitled, \"Best Practices for American Indian and Alaska Native Data Collection .\" To further TEC efforts to correct for racial misclassification to improve public health data quality, in 2019, IHS launched a pilot project with one TEC perm itting the use of IHS patient registration data to correct r ecords within CJ - 70numerous existing public health data sets for AI/AN race. This TEC performed eight linka ges to state public health data sets from September 2020 to April 2021, with data sets ranging in size from 1,355 records to 1,428,289 records. Misclassi fication of AI/AN varied widely , from 7.3 percent to 62.5 percent. AI/AN were most often misclassified as \"White\" race. Notably, a state -based COVID -19 disease registry misclassified 41.2 percent of IHS patients with known AI/AN status as non -Native. Th is work is ongoing and directly supports the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 3, Objective 3.3, Strategy 8 ( Assure system of data sharing to solidify partnerships with Tribal and urban Epidemiology Centers and other Tribal programs and Urban Indian Organizations ). This increase in information sharing with our TEC partners acknowledges and strengthens the statutory Public Health functions of the TEC program and builds on the expertise developed over the life of the program. Based on the success of this pilot work, two other TECs have proposed similar data linkage projects within their Areas. Of these, one TEC request has been approved and has begun work, and the other is nearing the final stages of development. Disease Surveillance and Evaluation In the expanding environment of Tribally- operated health programs, TECs provide additional public health services, such as disease control and prevention programs, in areas such as sexually transmitted disease control, HIV, and cancer prevention. TEC ef forts build capacity in the Indian health system by evaluating and monitor ing the effectiveness of health and public health programs. This allows TECs to assess access, use, and/or quality of care, and to develop recommendations for the targeting of services needed by the populations served. They manage public health information systems, investigate diseases of concern, manage disease prevention and control programs, communicate vital health information and resources, respond to public health emergencies, and coordinate these activities with other public health authorities. Collaboration The DEDP collaborates with the National Institutes of Health , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and others to supplement TEC activities, create stronger interagency partnerships, and prevent costly duplication of effort. TECs support national public health goals by working to improve data for the Government Performance and Results Act, agency performance reports, and monitoring of the Healthy People 20 30 objectives at the Tribal level. Health status reports across all TECs will lead to a more comprehensive picture of Indian health. In the long term, these activities create opportunities for IHS to improve the delivery of services by calling attention to health disparities or concerns experienced by the population the Agency serves. COVID-19 Response As part of the Public Health Response to the COVID- 19 emergency, TECs coordinated across their centers to hold weekly calls sharing best practices and collectively address concerns and problems, linked their websites to facilitate a single COVID -19 response webpage, and shared new tools and materials as they were developed to improve the speed of their collective response. Using budgeted funds, TECs have conducted a range of COVID- 19 response activities, including: 1) Direct responses to various technical assistance requests from Tribes . CJ - 712) Publishing COVID -19 case report and contact tracing tools. 3) Publishing community- specific fact sheets on COVID- related topics. 4) Identifying gaps in existing fact sheets and communications, includ ing coding data and how to talk to young children about COVID-19. 5) Developing fact sheets and communication materials to address tribal needs for community education. 6) Collaborating with local command teams as part of the Public Health response to the COVID-19 crisis . 7) Developing and releasing situational awareness reports to inform Tribal governments of local caseloads, treatment capacities, and vaccination effort s. 8) Launched Weekly COVID-19 Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes ( ECHO ) clinic call for providers. 9) COVID 19 Contact Tracing: IHS headquarters developed a data sharing agreement for implementation on the Area level which supports local COVID -19 contact tracing efforts. This data sharing requires sharing of patient- level, identifiable data from the IHS electronic health record (EHR) to effectively support contact tracing efforts. To date, one IHS Area- TEC partnership has established such an agreement serving the Oklahoma City Area. The TECs collectively developed and launched a COVID -19 specific website summarizing the work of other Public Health experts and collating their response work: https://tribalepicenters.org/tec -c ovid-19- COVID -19 response has progressed, TECs have continued to collaborate with each other, IHS, other agencies, and the communities they serve. Notable activities and successes of TECs include: Connect ed with Tribal Incident Command Structures to determ ine effective communication interfaces. Assessed immediate communication needs of communities, then created and disseminated risk communication materials. Developed and disseminated Service Area- level COVID -19 Situational Reports that included summary case and testing information, COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, testing locations, public health orders, etc. Provided COVID-19 case investigation, contact tracing and/or case/contact monitoring to communities. Provided COVID-19 contact tracing training s for tribal health program staff. For the time period March 2020 - September 20, 2021, conducted 95 COVID- 19 ECHO c linics with 10,920 attendees from throughout the US, Canada, and Guam . Conducted trainings on contact tracing, COVID -19 vaccine, data visual ization and mapping software and displays, cultural awareness of suicide a s it relates to COVID -19, and data collection. In response to the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization of COVID -19 Vaccines, one TEC launched a National COVID -19 Vaccine Campaign focused on creating accurate and culturally attuned COVID- 19 vaccine resources. The campaign is informed by results from a National COVID -19 Vaccination Survey on the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs among AI/ANs regarding the vaccine(s). The TEC was able to collect over 1,400 survey responses from AI/AN individuals in December 2020. To date, this program has developed several COVID -19 vaccine resources, including fact sheets on the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, a #vacciNATION poster series for use in clinics, and a two -video series discussing COVID -19 in Native communities. One TEC continues to provide Tribal Nation- specific COVID -19 surveillance reports to all Tribal Nations in the ir IHS Area. In addition to the number of COVID- 19 positive cases, the program is CJ - 72reporting the percentage of the population that has been fully vaccinated for the current and past week, and the percentage of delivered COVID -19 vaccination doses that have been administered. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount * 2019 $4,433,361 2020 $5,433,361 2021 *Funded under the H ospitals & Health Clinics budget. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2023 budget submission for the TECs under Hospitals and Health Clinics (H&HC) is $25 million and is the same as the FY 20 22 Enacted level . The funding per TEC covers the salaries of a Director, one full -time Epidemiologist, administrative assistance /support, evaluation capacity, Public Health response and collaboration capacity, comprehensive local Public Health planning efforts, special projects specific to disease states or local outbreaks, and the execution of additional pressing disparity projects or triba l priorities. DISCUSSION The TECs provide critical support to the communities they serve. In FY 2021, TECs responded to 4,870 requests for technical support (EPI-4) and completed 937 TEC -sponsored trainings for tribal public health capacity building (EPI -5). The increase in technical assistance from 2018-2019 requests and responses may reflect increased Tribal Public Health activities during the COVID -19 response. Technical support delivery was roughly sustained from 2020 activity levels. The increase in trainings and public health capacity building was supported by a significant increase in technical capacit ies to offer virtual training. TEC funding strengthens the capacity to t ranslate emerging public health strategies, resources, and information, which are critical in providing support to Tribes and necessary in quickly responding to the COVID -19 pandemic and in general public health decision- making .

These essential activities promote compliance with federal laws and regulations to improve efficiency and effectiveness of all I HS HIT portfolio investments. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The Office of Information Technology (OIT) successfully provided a secure and effective suite of technology solutions to support the agency and its mission throughout the country. Collaboration with tribal health programs and other federal agencies is key to the success of the HIT P ortfolio . IHS works closely with the ONC, CMS, Age ncy for Healthcare Research and Quality, VA, and other federal entities on IT initiatives to ensure the direction of its HIT systems are consistent with other federal agencies. In addition, IHS has routinely shared HIT artifacts CJ - 77(e.g., design and requirement documents, clinical quality logic, etc.) with both public and private organizations. The Health Information Technology Systems and Support (HITSS) program completed development for the 2015 Certified Electronic Health Record criteria. Deployment of the certified software is nearly complete and will be completed by the end of FY 2021. The HITSS program supported rapid development and deployment of software updates in response to the COVID -19 pandemic to support new diagnoses code sets, laboratory testing and resulting, and vaccine administration and reporting to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The program's work to support COVID includes major development to provide mechanisms for centralized reporting through the AIMS portal for COVID lab test ing, as well as the development of a centralized COVID vaccine reporting system, which also feeds a national dashboard available to IHS stakeholders. As part of the Agency effort for stabilization and modernization, the HITSS program is in the final stages to complete the 4 Directions Hub pilot project focused on health information exchange within government as well as the eHealth Exchange. Pilot sites are onboarded and testing is underway with the Veteran's Administration (VA) . The HITSS program certified our software to the FY 2021 eCQM certification requirements, and also completed the bi-annual re- certification of Electronic Prescribing of Controlled Substances ( EPCS) capabilities. The HITSS program completed a major software infrastructure database upgr ade, which facilitates the ability for sites to participate in planned health information exchange and interoperability requirements that will be delivered with the 21 Century Cures Act initiative. HITSS also successfully implemented a replacement for the Immunization Forecasting software used across our facilities. In addition to the high velocity response to COVID, our HITSS program staff delivered 14 full version updates and 96 required maintenance updates across the health IT portfolio for FY 2020 and 7 full version updates and 72 required maintenance updates as of June FY 2021. In response to the social distancing guidance, IHS adjusted the delivery of training to focus on virtual offerings. The program provided 309 HIT training courses to 9,331 I/T/U users in FY 2020. As of June 2021 for FY 2021, the program provided 255 HIT training courses to 15,519 I/T/U users - the number of participants greatly increased as additional COVID focused trainings were provided. Over 477,000 messages were exchanged between patients, providers, administrators, message agents and received from external HISPs through approximately 42,660 unique direct e- mail addresses since Sept 2015. The IHS Personal Health Record (PHR) has approximately 39,500 total users, and 54 perc ent of these registered PHR users were verified/linked to their IHS Medical Record. The remaining 46 percent are registered but not yet verified/linked. The National Patient Information Reporting System (NPIRS) investment leveraged its agile rapid application development and deployment lifecycle model to support the development of the IHS Disease Surveillance solutions in response to the COVID -19 pandemic. NPIRS continues to maintain COVID surveillance testing solutions that enable data collection and reporting of critical COVID -19 test data across Indian country. The agencies COIVD -19 data collection and reporting solutions enable data collection for over 300 federal, tribal and urban users and provide s immediate insight into testing results at the site, area and national levels. NPIRS also created customized BI reports that are auto -generated and distributed to tribal and urban partners unable to access the national dashboard. The COVID-19 testing solution automated the process by 95 percent and a lleviated massive amounts of manual data collection and reporting. NPIRS also collaborated with HHS and developed a custom data feed to support HHS Protect reporting. As part of the COVID- 19 vaccination initiative, NPIRS worked closely with the HITSS Inv estment and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to define the strategy for immunization collection and reporting. NPIRS developed several business intelligence/business analytic solutions to support vaccine administration (patient and employee), vaccine manufacturer, dosage, demographic and CJ - 78population information. In addition, a file management and tracking dashboard was developed that provides near real-time information on the submission of standard HL7 v2.5 messages containing patient vaccination information sent to IHS and CDC. All of the NPIRS BI/BA products enable federal, tribal and urban programs to track individual and national views (area, state, headquarters) of COVID data and enables users to validate data and identify gaps data in reporting to CDC. As part of this effort, daily office hour sessions and virtual training in the use of these products was provided to users. NPIRS developed an Opioid Surveillance dashboard for the National Committee on Heroin Opioids and Pain Efforts (HOPE) to pr omote appropriate and effective pain management, reduce overdose deaths from heroin and prescription opioid misuse, and improve access to culturally appropriate treatment. In support of this effort, a BDW -C Scorecard was created which provides information on data provisioning from the sites to support Opioid Surveillance. Iteration 2 of this effort continues into FY 2021. NPIRS continues to maintain and support the Enterprise BI/Analytic solutions within the Qlik Enterprise Environment to include user acc ess support, data refresh activities and enhancements for the agency. Enterprise BI solution support is provided to headquarters program offices, tribal, urban, area, service unit, and facility stakeholders. This support enables reporting, data discovery, data mining, predictive analysis and trending of key performance indicators supporting patient care and patient care management by providing strategic actionable information to key stakeholders. NPIRS continues to facilitate and improve reporting capabili ties for programs, such as the Office of Urban Indian Health Program (OUIHP) Uniform Data Set (UDS) reporting requirements, the Office of Clinical and Preventive Services (OCPS) GPRA/GPRAMA national reporting, Maternal Child Health, Partnership to Advance Tribal Health, Behavioral Health, Pharmacy reporting, and Quality initiatives. Quality initiatives include, but are not limited to the Inpatient/Outpatient Quality Reports, National Accountability for Quality, Wait Time and Improved Patient Care. In addition, extensive support has been provided to the Office of Finance and Accounting (OFA) national reporting efforts for budget execution and monitoring solutions. These efforts are ongoing and support national adhoc and recurring reporting requirements. IT Operations completed over 350 projects and acquired over 100 products and services. Notable projects and accomplishments are as follows: Expanded the ServiceNow platform to standardize processes, capabilities, and service alignment across IHS. The IHS implemented the Incident Management capability across the enterprise. Replaced all end -of-life hardware servicing approximately 160 Active Directory Domain Controllers. Expanded the Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution to meet the increased telework demands caused by the COVID -19 pandemic. Sustained above 99.9 percent network availability across all WAN and Internet connections used by HQ and Area Offices. Upgraded network circuits to increase bandwidth to approximately 18 IHS facilities. Awarded a n enterprise clinical video telehealth (CVT) solution that is cloud based, utilized the acquisition process to develop and submit an request for proposal, formed a clinical and technical panel to meet with and rate the vendor to support the selection process. IT Cybersecurity Program has three new cybersecurity policies pending approval: Security Assessment and Authorization; Audit and Accountability; and Configuration Management. Implementation of these new policies will help ensure cybersecurity activities are defined and executed consistently across the IHS enterprise to protect both information and information systems. In response to cybercriminal efforts to launch coronavirus- related scams, the IHS CJ - 79Cybersecurity Program developed a COVID Vaccine Cybersecurity Awareness Website that provides education about coronavirus scams, phishing attacks, and telework dangers employees might encounter. The website is located a new GEO -IP blocking solution that reduces the attack landscape for various command and control malware variants, malicious websites, and denial -of-service attacks targeting IHS. The new solution disrupts traffic bound for IHS from non-NATO countries or sent to non- NATO countries from IHS resulting in a significant reduction in denial -of-service attacks. Data from existing network devices was successfully imported into Splunk to search, monitor and analyze IHS network traffic and provide transparency for network security analysis and threat awareness and remediation. In addition , the IHS Cybersecurity Program is enhancing the threat analysis capability by adding tools to inspect encrypted and plain text traffic for external and internal networks to identify, evaluate and remediate threats in real -time. The IHS Cybersecurity Program is implementing user behavior analysis to develop an anomaly based threats response strategy. We are also leveraging a centralized data integrator for log management, capturing and analyzing threats and creating automated alerts to make informed and timely decisions. Our roadmap includes leveraging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to advance threat hunting capabilities and improve risk analysis across the enterprise. Additionally, we are in the process of implementing a Se curity Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR) technology that will combine the security infrastructure orchestration, playbook automation, case management capabilities and integrated threat intelligence to streamline processes and tools to respond quickly to security incidents. We continue to remediate open audit findings and weaknesses within OIT. Seven recommendations from OIG auditors have been implemented and forty- four weaknesses have been remediated through the Plan of Action and Milestones quar terly review process. IHS has responded timely to all Emergency Directives and Cybersecurity Executive Orders to ensure compliance levels are met as mandated. The IHS Cybersecurity Program has managed creation of more than 200 IHS facility backup/recovery plans for patient -care IT systems; and processed 137 new firewall rule requests a nd 698 annual firewall renewals. I T Management has improved IT governance through enhanced utilization of the Planview Portfolio Management System that provid es an enterprise IT portfolio and project management capability enabl ing IHS to improve project performance oversight and monitor corrective actions through to completion. The Planview system also provides a comprehensive Enterprise Architecture capability enabling line of sight linkage between IHS strategic goals & objectives, business capabilities, and the IT requirements needed to support those capabilities. These continued enhancements provide management tools to help ensure IHS prioritizes IT spend on investments that directly support strategic goals. OIT staff provided virtual present ations on HIT initiatives at various tribal or tribal health board conferences and meetings such as TribalNet , National Tribal Health Conference, Tribal Technical Advisory Group, National Indian Health Board (NIHB), NIHB Medicare, Medicaid, and Health Reform Policy Committee, IHS Tribal Self Governance Advisory Committee, and the Direct Service Tribes Advisory Com mittee quarterly meetings, etc. OIT staff regularly participated virtually in Tribal Delegation Meetings and the Alaska Area Pre- negotiation/Negotiation meetings to address IT/HIT issues. The OIT Healthcare Connect Fund Program provided support to 111 fe deral and 70 t ribal locations. The IHS Enterprise Mobile Services Program was established and accomplished the requirements of M-16-20 by establishing enterprise contracts with AT&T FirstNet and Verizon, and has transitioned over 99 percent of all IHS mobile devices to these contracts achieving both cost savings and cost avoidance by eliminating unnecessary MiFi devices and duplicative acquisition actions. CJ - 80Immediate Priorities and Challenges The IHS HIT P ortfolio continues to face increased demand for systems improvements and enhancements, rising costs, and increased IT security requirements driven in part by medical advances, and ever-growing and more complex requirements for health information technology capabili ties. These requirements come from government and industry initiatives, needs of health programs, and operational requests of I/T/U health care facilities. Each new program initiative has information technology requirements for functionality, modality, data collection, and reporting which then must be added to a clinician's work flow and managed within the HIT portfolio. A major priority of and challenge to the current HIT Portfolio is continuous improvement to and sustainment of the RPMS suite while simu ltaneously engaging in HIT Modernization. As described elsewhere in this document, IHS has embarked on a major, multi- year initiative to modernize its HIT solutions. The intent is to fully replace RPMS, which has its origins in the 1970s, with a modern, commercial off -the-shelf suite of applications that address the full range of capabilities that RPMS currently supports. The build and rollout of a new system to replace RPMS is expected to take 7 -10 years, during which RPMS must be continuously maintaine d to support high- quality, safe healthcare services and revenue cycle management nationwide. This will inevitably include enhancements to remain current with the ever -changing regulatory environment, as well as to meet evolving program needs at IHS. Many of the core components of RPMS are derived from the VA's VistA system, which is also scheduled for retirement over the next several years. Choices made by the VA regarding maintenance and enhancement of VistA will affect IHS, and possibly even shift a maintenance burden to IHS if we remain dependent on components that VA no longer supports. In any case, the requirement to support a legacy system while simultaneously designing and implementing a modernized one will substantially challenge the capacity of information technology staff at all levels of the organization. CyberSecurity challenges include minimizing unsecured systems and data to reduce the possibility of data loss, ransomware infections, identity theft, risk to patient health data, system breac hes, and loss of business continuity in the event of a disaster. System breach or intrusion into an unsecure network puts patient data at risk, impacts the IHS mission by delaying or halting patient care, and harms IHS patients lead ing to a lack of trust in patient services. Human resource shortages and slow staff backfill contributes to challenges in keeping up with evolving technology and new Federal, Department and Operating Division projects/initiatives including FITARA Implementation. OIT has a persistent vacancy rate of 40 percent. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount1 2019 $182,149,000 2020 $182,149,000 Budget 1This represents the total cost of HIT within IHS federal programs. The majority is from Hospitals & Health Clinics budget line with a small amount from Direct Operations for federal personnel and travel. CJ - 81TRIBAL SHARES H&HC (IT is funded out of H&HC) funds are subject to tribal shares, currently at approximately 25 percent , and are transferred to Tribes when they assume the responsibility for carrying out the associated programs, functions, services, and activities. A small portion of the overall H&HC budget line is reserved for inherently federal functions and is therefore retained by the IHS to perform the basic operational services of the Agency. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2023 budget submission of $191 million for Health Information Technology is +$9 million above FY 2022 Enacted level. This funding will continue progress made in past years by minimizing infrastructure costs and maintaining a high level of productivity and commitment by both federal and contractor staff supporting the IHS-developed health information solutions. IHS uses open source tools where possible to minimize acquisition costs . Foll owing the VA announcement to sunset their VistA EHR application the IHS and HHS CTO began an analysis of alternatives to assess the sustainability of the entire RPMS HIT platform. The HHS -IHS HIT Modernization Research Project was completed in FY 2020 to examine alternatives to replace or modify RPMS as the IHS HIT platform. The HIT Modernization Project identified the need to change the current EHR platform to a modern commercial-off-the- shelf (COTS) EHR that will improve the impact and quality of direct patient care, increase cost recovery and promote continuous health improvements such as, expanded telehealth care services and predictive population health analytics. These potential returns highlight the value of health IT and its impact on the agency mission. FY 2023 Funding Increase of $9 m ill ion includes: General Increase: + $9 million to support new FTE and existing salary costs. Funding for the Office of Information Technology has remained stagnant for the last 10 years, and pay costs and tribal shares have impacted the ability of this critical program to support its full salary cost and hire the staff necessary to ensure appropriate operations at the Agency. During this time demand for IT services, and costs associated with new IT requirements have grown significantly. As a result of stagnating funding and increasing demands, the IHS has delayed performing routine maintenance and system upgrades, and many systems are beyond their industry best practices life cycle, while trying to preserve funding for existing staff salaries. This creates unnecessary risk for all IHS programs that rely on digital capabilities. C urrently, the IHS has enough funding to support approximately 51 of the 75 staff currently supported by the Health Information Technology budget. The IHS charges costs to the Area Offices where appropriate to address the funding gap, but this is not a sustainable approach. In addition to the 75 current FTE, an additional 20 FTE are required to appropriately manage the Health Information Technology workload. The requested funding would bolster the existing Health IT budget, supporting salary costs, alleviating pressure on n eeded upgrades and modifications, and onboarding additional FTE to ensure that IHS digital capabilities can support key management and oversight functions, and support high quality care.

Direct Federal; PL 93 -638 Tribal Contracts/Compacts , Tribal shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Electronic Health Record System Modernization - The health information technology (HIT) system currently in use at IHS is the Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS), a comprehensive health information suite that supports a broad range of clinical, population health, and business processes from patient registration through the billing cycle. RPMS was internally deve loped by IHS, leveraging a decades-long collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and is certified to the 2015 Edition criteria published by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). In recent years, advances in health - related standards and technologies, an increasingly complex regulatory environment around HIT, and the decision of the VA to move to a commercial off-the-shelf HIT solution, have combined to make the current approach to IHS HIT development and support non-sustainable going forward. In 2018-19, IHS, in collaboration with HHS, engaged in comprehensive research and analysis of t he current state of its HIT infrastructure and options for modernization. Informed by the outcomes of that project, IHS has published its intent to move forward with modernization by transitioning from its legacy RPMS to state of the art, commercial off -the-shelf systems. The approach to modernization is not limited to an Electronic Health Record (EHR), but must support a true enterprise approach to HIT, enabling the highest quality inpatient, ambulatory, behavioral health, dental, pharmacy, laboratory, imaging, referral, and revenue cycle services, with standards- based interoperability and analytics capabilities, positioning IHS in the best possible way to accomplish its mission in the coming years. The replacement of RPMS support the HHS Strategic Goal 4 \" Restore Trust and Accelerate Advancements in Science and Research for All\" and HHS Strategic Goal 5 \"Advance Strategic Management to Build Trust, Transparency, and Accountability\" In early FY 2021, the IHS executed a Task Order to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Alliance to Modernize Healthcare Federally Funded Research and Development Cente r (Health FFRDC) to formally launch the IHS health IT modernization initiative. The Health FFRDC, managed by the MITRE Corporation, is responsible for standing up the Program Management Office, supporting the governance structure for the initiative, assis ting with acquisition planning, market research, stakeholder engagement, communication, and numerous other aspects of the initiative. IHS issued Requests for Information (RFI) from industry and one CJ - 84or more subsequent Requests for Proposals (RFP) before the end of FY 2022, with an intent to award initial HIT modernization contracts in early FY 2023. In the meantime, IHS will be adding permanent staff to manage the numerous aspects of HIT modernization that are inherently federal and will need to be sustained for the foreseeable future. IT Infrastructure and Operations Modernization - Significant improvements are required in order for the information technology (IT) infrastructure at IHS to fully support the deployment of a new, modern HIT solution. IHS mus t enhance cybersecurity, improve IT service management, expand storage and computing capacity, and increase network bandwidth at dozens of rural locations to enable a successful EHR transformation. IT operations throughout IHS will need to be managed and coordinated more effectively to successfully execute a complex modernization project. Part of the work tasked to the Health FFRDC referenced above is a comprehensive analysis of infrastructure gaps, conducted in collaboration with the IHS technology operations staff. This analysis will facilitate planning and prioritization of infrastructure upgrades in preparation for EHR modernization (HHS Objective 5.4: Ensure the security and climate resiliency of HHS facilities, technology, data, and information, while advancing environment- friendly practices.) C urrent active projects in support of the modernization goal include establishing a national hub for connection to the eHealth Exchange in order to support health information exchange (HIE) with the VA, Depart ment of Defense, and other external partners, as well as leveraging the experience of COVID -19 to improve the agency's capabilities for enterprise reporting of immunizations, laboratory results, and public health notifications to state and federal entities (HHS Objective 2.2: Protect individuals, families, and communities from infectious disease and non-communicable disease through equitable access to effective, innovative, readily available diagnostics, treatments, therapeutics, medical devices, and vaccines.) The IHS Modernization of Health IT System & Support (mHITSS) investment is the primary mechanism IHS will utilize to modernize HIT in support of IHS Strategic Plan Goal 3, Objective 3.3, \"Modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decisions\" (HHS Goals 1,2,4&5) . FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount $0 2020 2021 Final $34,500,000 2022 Enacted $145,019 President's Budget $284,500 ,000 BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2023 budget submission for E lectronic H ealth Record Modernization is $285 m illion . This is an increase of $140 m illion above the FY 2022 Enacted level. The current IHS electronic health record is over 50 years old, and the GAO identifies it as one of the 10 most critical federal legacy systems in need of modernization. The IHS relies on its electronic health record for all aspects of patient care, including the patient record, prescriptions, care referrals, and bill ing public and private insurance for over $1 billion reimbursable health care services annually. Depending on the availability of appropriations, the IHS expects to be gin the site implementation phase in FY 2023, which will require significant additional resources to CJ - 85an alyze the needs of hundreds of sites, implement the new system, replace outdated equipment, and other related steps. This funding will lay the groundwork to improve the quality of care, reduce the cost of care, promote interoperability, sim plify IT service management, increase the security of patient data, enhance cybersecurity, and update infrastructure across rural locations to enable a successful Electronic Health Record transition. This will include the continuation of project management operations, acquisition planning, EHR selection, additional tribal consultation, initial infrastructure build, site implementation planning, and continued RPMS stabilization and support. The project will follow industry standards for modernization or repl acement of Electronic Health Record systems to leverage expertise and experience in the private sector (HHS Objective 5.3: Uphold effective and innovative human capital resource management resulting in an engaged, diverse workforce with the skills and comp etencies to accomplish the HHS mission .) This effort directly supports IHS's entire Strategic Goals structure. H ealth Information Technology Modernization - The IHS Health Information Technology Modernization effort will use the additional FY 2023 resources to execute several core activities in FY 202 3. Specifically, the IHS expects to address the following: o R PMS Stabilization: IHS will complete updates to the legacy systems to achieve compliance with the 21st Century Cures updates for 2015 Editi on ONC certification. Significant development, testing, patching, rollout and training efforts will be required, using expanded contract resources. o Interoperability: T he IHS will complete its interoperability pilot in FY 2023, and then begin a national rollout to enable exchange both within the IHS enterprise and with external referral network partners. This effort will require sub stantial testing with partners as sites are on -boarded in order to ensure seamless and accurate interoperability (HHS Objec tive 4.4: Improve data collection, use, and evaluation, to increase evidence- based knowledge that leads to better health outcomes, reduced health disparities, and improved social well-being, equity, and economic resilience.) o Immunization Information S ystems: The IHS is planning additional initiatives to move certain capabilities from the local to the enterprise level, including centralized systems to accomplish exchange with state immunization information systems and reporting to public health agencies (HHS Objective 2.2: Protect individuals, families, and communities from infectious disease and non-communicable disease through equitable access to effective, innovative, readily available diagnostics, treatments, therapeutics, medical devices, and vacci nes.) o Initial Build of EHR Environment: With a vendor selection for the new EHR system in early FY 2022, work will begin on the design and build steps, to prepare the commercial system for operation in the IHS environment. This activity typically takes twe lve months with significant resources required to convene and gather input from subject matter experts across a range of disciplines and move decisions that could number in the thousands through governance processes to meet the agency's configuration requirements. o Local Needs: Once the IHS selects an EHR product, the Agency can define the technology architecture required for optimal performance of and support for the system. The IHS can then target identified gaps at local facilities and in the wide CJ - 86ar ea network and hosting systems . This effort will include both capital (equipment) and resource (contract) costs. o I nitial Site(s) Transition Planning : Resources will support the development of a core planning template and master deployment schedule. This will also accommodate individual site planning using the template to address technology infrastructure remediation, site configuration, end user training, change management, communication, and stakeholder engagement at the local level near the deployment targe t for each site. Many of these activities need to be completed in a short amount of time immediately prior to a site's go -live. T he IHS anticipates building the enterprise solution and preparing and planning site deployments in FY 2023. o This project holds an extremely high degree of mission criticality given the ability to provide much- anticipated clinical and administrative capabilities used in modern systems for the delivery of timely and impactful healthcare. Expected benefits from ad opting and implementing a modernized system include, but are not limited to : improved patient safety, improved patient outcomes, better disease management, enhanced population health, improved clinical quality measures, opioid tracking, patient data exchange, third party revenue generation, agency performance reporting, and more . Additionally, the IHS intends to achieve the best possible interoperability with the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, Tribal and U rban Indian health programs , academic affiliates, and community partners, many of whom use different HIT platforms. The IHS must acquire a state-of-the- art EHR system that supports a true enterprise approach to HIT, enabling the highest quality inpatient, ambulatory, behavioral health and other ancillary healthcare and business office services, with standards- based interoperability and analytics capabilities, positioning IHS in the best possible way to accomplish its mission in the coming years. During the estimated 10 -year implemen tation, IHS expects to temporarily increase the HIT workforce to acquire and implement this system (HHS Objective 1.5: Bolster the health workforce to ensure delivery of quality services and care.) I HS Legacy EHR System Modernization - The current IHS EHR, Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS), has been identified by the Government Accoun tability Office as one of HHS' s top three systems in most need of modernization due to lack of development and enhanc ement work over the past decade. IHS must mai ntain the existing EHR system until implementation of the new system is complete. I T Infrastructure and Operations Modernization - These IT Infrastructure Modernization initiatives are required to provide the platform for which the EHR operates and support redundancy capacity . IHS Strategic Goal 1 , Objective 1 .2, \"Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships.\" IHS will build a mature governance body to ensure the enterprise HIT investment is properly m aintained and configured nationwide. IHS Strategic Goal 2 , Objective 2.1 \"Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization\" , and Objective 2.2, \"Provide care to better meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities.\" CJ - 87T he Dentrix software will be upgraded nationwide to coordinate care in a national enterprise HIT environment. Addit ionally, f unding will al low for improved recruitment and retention of providers and r educed industry risk by adopting standards and systems used by a broader base of healthcare systems. IHS Strategic Goal 3, Objective 3.3, \"Modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decisions.\" Funding will all ow for i mproved revenue from third party payers , improved training through standardized user interfaces and integration across health facilities, r educed workload to support the infrastructure, and i mproved quality and operational oversight through improved national reporting and data analytics (HHS Objective 5.2: Sustain strong financ ial stewardship of HHS resources to foster prudent use of resources, accountability, and public trust .) OUTPUTS/OUTCOMES As IHS reviews options, costs, and potential benefits; output and outcome measures will be developed. The new EHR environment will support existing measures for the Government Performance and Re sults Act (GPRA) and electronic quality measures to support healthcare accreditation.

Permanent Allocation Method ............................... Direct Federal , P.L. 93 -638 Self- Determination Contracts, Tribal shares, Grants, and Self -Governance Compacts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The purpose of the Indian Health Service (IHS) Dental Health Program (DHP) is to raise the oral health status of the American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) population to the highest possible level through the provision of quality preventive and treatment services, at both community and clinic sites. The DHP is a service-oriented program providing basic dental services (e.g., diagnostic, emergency, preventive, and basic restorative care) , which represents approximately 90 percent of the dental services provi ded. In FY 2021, the DHP provided a total of 2,594,836 basic dental services, only a slight decline from FY 2020, in which the DHP provided 2,595,059 services. These two years marked a 36 percent decline in services when compared to pre- pandemic levels, and during the pandemic many programs provided fewer services due to dentists and staff providing non- dental pandemic -related services and providing fewer dental services because of the incorporation of new infection control and prevention pandemic- related mitigation strategies. More complex rehabilitative care (e.g., root canals, crowns and bridges, dentures, and surgical extractions) is provided where resources allow and accounted for the additional 192,372 dental services in FY 2021, a 7 percent increase from FY 2020 but still a 30 percent drop from FY 2019 pre -pandemic levels. The DHP provided these services through 886,266 dental visits in FY 2021, a 3 percent drop from FY 2020, again due to factors such as deployment of dental staff to non-dent al pandemic roles (vaccinations, contact tracing, etc.) and the increased time DHP clinics took to implement new infection control and prevention procedures caused by the pandemic. Across all age groups, AI/ANs suffer disproportionately from dental disease. When compared to other racial or ethnic groups, AI/AN children 2-5 years old have more than double the number of decayed teeth and overall dental caries experience as the next highest ethnic group, U.S. Hispanics, and more than four times that of U.S. white children. 1 In the 6- 9 year -old age group, 1 Phipps KR, Ricks TL, Mork NP, and Lozon TL.

Rockville, MD: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Indian Health Service, 201 9. CJ - 898 out of 10 AI/AN children have a history of dental caries compared with only 45 percent of the general U.S. population, and almost half of AI/AN children have untreated tooth decay compared to just 17 percent of the general U.S. population in this age group.2 In the 13-15 year-old age group, three out of four AI/AN dental clinic patients have a history of tooth decay, compared to half of 13-15 year-olds in the general U.S. population, and almost three times as many 13 -15 year-old AI/AN youth have untreated decay compared to the general U.S. population.3 In adults, the disparity in disease is equally as pronounced. 64 percent of AI/AN adults 35 -49 years have untreated decay compared to just 27 percent of the general U.S. population, and across all other age groups studied (50-64 years, 65-74 years, and 75 and older), AI/AN adults have more than double the prevalence of untreated tooth decay as the general U.S. population. In addition, the rate of severe periodontal disease in AI/AN adults is almost double that of the general U.S. population. 4 Prevention activities improve health and reduce the amount and cost of subsequent dental care. The DHP measures performance in part through the delivery of preventive services. The DHP maintains data and tracks three key program objectives: 1. Increase the proportion of 2- 15 year -olds with dental sealants; 2. Increase the proportion of 1- 15 year -olds receiving at least one application of topical fluorides; and 3. Increase access to care across all age groups. The DHP funds provide critical support for direct health care services focused upon strengthening the collaborative partnerships among direct care providers, patients, communities, and internal and external stakeholders. Funds are utilized to ensure IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian health organizations have comprehensive, culturally appropriate services and personnel available and accessible, promotes excellence and quality through implemented quality improvement strategies, and strengthens the IHS program management and operations to address health disparities and raise the health status of AI/AN populations to the highest level possible. The DHP provides critical services in support of the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023 (IHS SP) and the HHS Draft Strategic Plan (HHS Draft SP). Dental services are important in ensuring comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available to AI/AN people (IHS SP Goal 1). DHP implements several efforts to improve quality (IHS SP Goal 2) of dental health services and in strengthening management and operations (IHS SP Goal 3). C entral to DHP efforts is support of cross-collaboration and partnerships among I/T/U stakeholders (IHS SP Objective 1.2). The DHP provides essential services to increase dental health access and education which supports the HHS SP Draft Goal 1: Protect and Strengthen Equitable Access to High Quality and Affordable Health Care , and Draft Goal 5: Advance Strategic Management to Build Trust, Transparency, and Accountability . The program accomplishments section below provides details about DHP efforts. 2 Phipps KR and Ricks T L.

CJ - 90PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Early Caries Collaborative The IHS Early Childhood Caries (ECC) Collaborative was a nationwide initiative that was conducted from 2009 to 2017 and focused on preventing tooth decay in AI/AN children under the age of 71 months. Dental caries are the most common health problem in children, almost eight times more common than childhood asthma, and have significant consequences such as delayed speech development, more missed school days when children begin school, poor self- esteem, and a greater chance of tooth decay in permanent teeth. 5 As previously described , AI/AN children suffer disproport ionately from this disease, with more than double the number of decayed teeth as the next highest minority population, U.S. Hispanics, and more than 3 times t he number of decayed teeth as U.S. White children.6 The ECC Collaborative began with the goal of reducing dental caries in the AI/AN population through a coordinated, nationwide collaborative utilizing not only dental programs but also medical and communi ty partners such as medical providers, public health nurses, community health representatives, pharmacists, and Head Start teachers. (Suppo rts IHS SP 1.2 and HHS Draft SP Objective1.2: Reduce costs, improve quality of health - care services, and ensure access to safe medical devices and drugs .) By the end of this collaborative, the IHS had increased access to dental care for AI/A N children under 71 months by 7.9 percent and significantly increased prevention and early intervention efforts (sealants increased by 65.0 percent, the number of children receiving fluoride varnish increased by 68.2 percent, and the number of thera peutic fillings increased by 161 percent). ( Supports IHS S P Objective 1.3: Increase access to quality health care services ; and HHS Draft SP Objective 1.3: Expand equitable access to comprehensive, community-based, innovative, and culturally-competent health care services while recognizing social determinants of health. ) This resulted in a 5 percent reduction in caries (tooth decay) experience from 2010 to 2019, and a 14 percent reduction in untreated decay in 1- 5 year -olds (with statistical significance) at a national level; in addition, the Navajo, Oklahoma City, and Phoenix Areas had statistically significant reductions in caries experience from 2010 to 2019. ( Supports the IHS SP Goal 2: To promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization, IHS Objective 2.2: Provide care to better meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities ; and HHS SP Objective1.2 .) This represents the first recorded decrease in tooth decay in young children in the IHS and is evidence of success of the Early Childhood Caries Collaborative. Furthermore, this success has impacted older children: the 2016-17 survey of 6-9 year-old children showed that caries experience decreased from 92 percent to 87 percent in this age group from 1999 to 2016- 17, while untreated caries decreased from 73 percent to 47 percen t over the same time period . These data represent the first recorded decrease in tooth decay in this age group as well and reflects positively on the ECC Collaborative and the ongoing prevention efforts of the DHP focusing on schoolchildren. Since the Collaborative ended in 2017, the core concepts - early access to dental care, fluoride varnish applications three to four times a year, dental sealants in primary teeth, and interim therapeutic restorations - have all been institutionalized across the system . In FY 2018 and FY 2019, access to dental care, fluoride varnish, sealants, and interim therapeutic restorations all continued to be performed across the system at the same level as the 2009 -2017 time period. However, the pandemic caused a steep decline in these services, and the problem was exacerbated by this age group (1- 5year -olds) not being able to receive COVID-19 vaccinations. Consequently, access to dental care for 1 -5 year -olds decreased by 61 percent from the 2009-2019 time period to FY 2021, dental sealants decreased by 69 percent over the same time period , fluoride varnish CJ - 91application decreased by 58 percent over the same time period, and the interim therapeutic restorations decreased by 67 percent over the same time period. Dental Clinical and Preventive Support Centers In recent years, the DHP has utiliz ed field dental programs in conjunction with its Dental Clinical and Preventive Support Centers (DSC) to achieve national performance objectives, support IHS Area initiatives, and support the IHS Strategic Plan for FY 2019-2023. ( Supports IHS S P Objective 1.2 and HHS SP Objective1.2.) The DSCs were designed and implemented in FY 2000 to augment the dental public health infrastructure necessary to best meet the oral health needs of AI/AN communities. The current five- year funding cycle began December 1, 2020, with six DSCs funded through grants and t hree DSCs funded through program awards. In FY 2021, the Division of Oral Health received an additional $1,000,000 to increase the number of DSCs. Th e increase in FY 2021 funding allow ed for the establishment of a ninth DSC and allow ed each DSC to receive an increased amount of annual funding, resulting in an expansion of services to AI/AN communities in all twelve IHS Areas . Expansion of the number of DSCs, utilizing best practices learned from the existing DCSs , will assist in controlling oral disease and decrease oral health disparities experienced in susceptible or high -risk populations. In FY 2022 an additional $1,000,000 was received and will assist the 9 DCPSCs to continue to expand the services provided to AI/AN communities. The primary purpose of a DSC is to provide technical support, training, and assistance in clinical and preventive aspects of dental programs providing care to AI/AN communiti es. As a direct result of the advocacy efforts of the DSCs, the number of key preventive procedures such as fluoride and sealant applications ha ve been maintained throughout the last decade. In FY 2013, the DHP began tracking the coverage or prevalence o f children and adolescents receiving sealants and topical fluoride, rather than simply counting dental procedures. These assessments allow improved comparisons with data from the U.S. population compiled by the Healthy People 2030 initiative. DSCs were in itially funded in FY 2000. In the ensuing years, the DSCs have had an immediate positive impact on the direct delivery of dental care in a number of ways: All DSCs advocated for an appropriate focus on the dental Government Performance and Results Act ( GPRA) performance objectives to increase specific clinical and community- based oral health services. All DSCs provided continuing education opportunities for clinical staff to enhance the quality of care delivered. Several DSCs provided on-site clinical and community based program reviews to enhance the quality of care, assuring that field programs maintain a high level of expertise with respect to challenges such as infection control, preparing for program accreditation and certification reviews, and patient scheduling practices aimed at maximizing access to care. Several DSCs provided an array of health education materials or designed materials customized to the specific needs of the IHS Areas they serve. These materials have increased the quality and quantity of IHS oral health education efforts throughout Indian Country. Several DSCs provided or arranged for direct clinical services that otherwise would not have been provided. By providing clinical support in collaboration with IHS Area Dental Officers, the DSCs have contributed to a 70 percent increase in basic dental services (2.44 million in FY 2001 to 4.16 million in FY 2019) over the first 19 years of their existence. CJ - 92Dental Health Data Access to dental services is a prerequisite to the control of oral disease in susceptible or high -risk populations. The access to care GPRA objective is aligned with the Healthy People 2030 methodology as a percentage of patients who have visited the dentist within the previous 12 mo nths. ( GPRA measure data supports the IHS S P Objective 1.3 and HHS S P Objective 1.3.) Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic greatly affected dental care to the AI/AN population. Most IHS facilities ceased routine care, including preventive services, beginning in mid -March 2020, and while a few began to re-open routine care in late May 2020, a substantial number of dental facilities continued to provide emergency or scaled back services well into FY 2021. The dentist to population ratio in the IHS system continues to be very low when compared to the ratio in the U.S. private sector. This low dentist to population ratio and an increase in population growth in the AI/AN population will continue to present a challenge in achieving the access rate goal. The IHS has 1,0 58 dentists (including part -time) in the system, according to the IHS Dental Directory. 7 In 2019, there were 3,015,921 AI/AN in the U.S., according to the most recent user population estimate.8 That means that the IHS system has approximately 1 dentist per 2,850 patients served. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were an estimated 139,200 dentists in the U.S. in 20219 serving a population of 331,893,745,10 meaning that there is approximately 1 dentist per 2,384 people served. The DHP continues to assess the care provided by its programs through a robust, continuing oral health surveillance program that started in 2010 and is planned through 2030. ( Supports the IHS SP Goal 3: To Strengthen IHS program management and operations through Objective 3.3: Modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decision. It also supports the HHS Draft S trategic Plan Goal 4: Restore trust and accelerate advancements in science and research for all through HHS Draft Objective 4.3: Strengthen surveillance, epidemiology, and laboratory capacity to understand and equitably address diseases and conditions.) 0-5 year -old AI/AN children were surveyed in 2010, 2014, and 2018-19; 6- 9 year - old children were surveyed in 2011-12 and 2016-17: 13- 15 year -old youth were surveyed in 2013 and 2019-20; and AI/AN adults were surveyed in 2015. In FY 2021, the DHP is once again conducting surveillance of AI/AN adults with over 80 programs participating and a final data brief expected in late 2022. The surveillance program has been used as a model nationally and helps highlight disparities in disease burden and distribution in the AI/AN population. Results of all surveys can be found in data briefs located on the IHS Dental Portal at www.ihs.gov/doh , and data from this surveillance program is also included in the CDC National Oral Health Surveillance System, allowing public health advocates to compare AI/AN disease prevalence with individual state or national data. Dental Health Service Delivery Improvements The DHP continues to make significant improvements in the way dental services are delivered. Through support of implementation of an electronic dental record (EDR) , over 82 percent of IHS Federal, Tribal, and Urban (I/T/U) dental clinics have transitioned to an EDR system to support the delivery of effective quality dental services. The IHS Dentrix Enterprise (DXE) EDR program has been successfully implemented at 274 of these I/T/U dental clinics. There remains 7 Indian Health Service, Department of Health and Human Services.

The EDR capability provides accurate data collection and dissemination through the IHS National Data Warehouse. This data supports evaluation of Oral Health Initiatives such as the Early Childhood Caries collaborative and future data development could improve outcome measurements. In FY 2020, the DHP received a $2 million appropriation to supplement the DHP-provided funds for the EDR project to complete additional implementations. For FY 2021, a funding increase of $500,000 was received to support new EDR implementations, enhance the EDR including interfaces with multiple electronic health record (EHR) and other healthcare network systems. In FY 2022, a funding increase of $1,000,000 was received to continue to support new EDR implementations and continue to enhancements to the EDR and provide necessary updates. Despite the pandemic- related travel restrictions, the DHP EDR Implementation and Support cont ract (EDR Contract) was able to install the IHS version of Dentrix for 13 new locations in FY 2021. In addition, the increased $2 .5 million funding allowed the DHP to assist 144 I/T/U clin ics to upgrade to Windows 10 supported Dentrix versions. This upgrade to Windows 10 supported versions is necessary for all 274 IHS Dentrix -using sites to ensure patient data is safely processed and archived. As the funds are expected to be recurring annually, the plan is to enhance the EDR as follows: in addition to the 9-12 more new EDR implementations each year, the DHP expects to support all I/T/U clinics to upgrade to the Windows 10 supported and most current versions of the IHS Dentrix Enterprise EDR system. The additional funding w ill also be used to enhance reporting capability for the IHS individual patient- based Oral Health Status (OHS) measure that allows the local clinic to identify patients in need of urgent and/or preventive oral health care. Additional IHS- specific EDR development in FY 20 20-2021 included the development of several IHS Dentrix EDR to EHR systems used by Tribal and Urban medical clinics that do not use the IHS Resource, Patient, and Management System (RPMS) EHR program. Other IHS Dentrix EDR developments include: standardized Provider Clinical Notes templates (to streamline accurate patient treatment notes in the EDR); standardized data reporting updates; Dentrix scanned document QA review; and additional Quality of Care rev iew reports. Additional improvements in billing capabilities could increase third party collections for all I/T/U dental clinics .

It also supports the HHS Draft Strategic Plan Goal 5: Advance Strategic Management to Build Trust, Transparency, and Accountability through HHS Draft Objective 5. 2: Sustain strong financi al stewardship of HHS resources to foster prudent use of resources, accountability, and public trust.) A second way the DHP has improved the delivery of care is through ongoing support of long- term training (LTT) of general dentist s to build the cadre of dental specialists in the IHS and t ribal dental programs. (The DHP LTT program supports the IHS SP Objective 1.1: Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce, and HHS Draft SP Objective1. 5: Bolster the primary and preventive health care workforce to ensure delivery of quality services and care.) Dentists completing DHP - sponsored LTT to become specialist such as pediatric dentists, periodontists, and endodontists have a service payback obligation to serve AI/AN patients. In the past 5 years, an Oral Maxillofacial Surgeon and seven pediatric dentists have returned from LTT to serve A I/AN patients. A third way the DHP is improving the delivery of services is through the adoption of an integrated care model, specifically in prom oting depression screenings by dental health providers through a collaboration with the IHS Behavioral Health Program. ( The collaborative efforts between the DHP and the IHS Behavioral Health Program to improve the delivery of services support the IHS SP Objective 2.1 . These 2 accomplishments also support the HHS Draft SP Objective 1. 4: Drive the integration of behavioral health into the healthcare system to strengthen and expand access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment and recovery services for individuals and families .) CJ - 94The DHP continues to improve the delivery of services is through a sustained (20+ years) continuing dental education (CDE) program. The IHS CDE program provides high quality continuing education accredited through the American Dental Association Continuing Education Provider Recognition Program . In FY 2021, despite a significant decrease of in-person educational opportunities due to the ongoing pandemic, the IHS CDE program still accounted for 263 courses, offering 1,177 hours of training. Subsequently, 1934 dentists participated in the CDE program as well as 1,787 dental hygienists and dental assistants and a total of 26,588 hours of CDE credits were awarded to dental staff working in IHS, Tribal, and Urban dental programs. In the past, one CDE credit has been estimated to be valued between $100 -$200. This valuation includes the equivalent tuition cost that would be incurred seeking CDE in the private sector and the cost of the time and travel away from the office to attend CDE outside the IHS CDE program. Therefore, the total financial benefit to the IHS from the CDE Program in FY 2021 was between $2.6 and $5.2 million. Since 2016, the IHS CDE Program has pr ovided over $32.2 million in free CDE through over 1,500 CDE courses. The accomplishments of this program over the last 6 years ranks it as one of the largest CDE programs in the country within and outside of the federal government. The DHP has also been the largest trainer of expanded function dental assistants (EFDA) in the Nation. The EFDA workforce model was introduced to the profession in 1961 by the IHS. EFDAs are trained and certified dental assistants with competencies to al low them to perform simple dental cleanings and fillings under the general supervision of a dentist, thereby increasing productivity , efficiency, and effectiveness of IHS, tribal, and urban dental programs. Since 2016, the IHS CDE Program has held 110 di fferent in -person EFDA courses that have resulted in 557 dental assistants initiating EFDA training (over one- fourth of the dental assistant workforce) and 483 completing the training and certification requirements. The models of expanded function dental assistants have been shown to increase access to dental care in the DHP by up to 3.0 percent , increase total services delivered by dental programs up to 5.1 percent , and increase the total services per patient visit by up to 14 percent . (The DHP CDE program supports the IHS SP Objective 2.1 through strategies that focus on providing training, coaching, and mentoring to ensure quality improvement and accountability of staff at all levels of the organization. The DHP continues to evaluate training efforts and staff implementation of improvements, as appropriate. The DHP CDE program also supports the HHS Draft SP Objective 1.2.) The DHP continues to be on the forefront of hot issues in public health dentistry. The DHP, through the CDE Program, addressed public health issues such as antibiotic stewardship, opioid overdose reversal in dental settings, managing opioid use disorder through medication -assisted therapy, the growing threat of e- cigarettes in adolescents, community water fluoridation, the phase-down of dental amalgam, the new periodontal disease classification standards, improving oral health literacy, issues related to COVID -19 and oral health, silver diamine fluoride (SDF) , and the integration of oral health and primary care. Additionally, the DHP developed new guidelines on the use of SDF for dental caries arrest and initiated new projects including integration of prevention services by medical providers to use SDF , and a summary of initiatives and guidelines that can be viewed at the IHS Dental Portal at www.ihs.gov/doh. ( The IHS Pain Management Guidelines support the IHS SP Objective 1.3 and HHS Draft SP Objective1.3.) COVID-19 The COVID -19 pandemic has disproportionately affected American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations across the country. Data indicates AI/ANs have infection rates over 3.5 times higher than non- Hispanic whites, are over four times more likely to be ho spitalized as a result of COVID -19, and have higher rates of mortality at younger ages than non- Hispanic CJ - 95whites. The IHS continues to work closely with our Tribal partners, Urban Indian Organizations, state, and local public health officials to coordinate a comprehensive public health response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. During FY 2020 and early FY 2021, the Indian health care system has modified health care delivery and adapted programming to address COVID-19. This budget narrative may include examples of how care or programming was adapted to address COVID -19. Please refer to the Overview of Agency Performance for additional information about the IHS COVID- 19 Response. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount 2019 $197,949,000 2020 $210,602,000 2021 Final $214,687,000 2022 Enacted $235,788 ,000 2023 President's Budget $309,193 ,000 TRIBAL SHARES Dental funds are subject to tribal shares and are transferred to t ribes when they assume the responsibility for operating the associated programs, functions, services, and activities, unless otherwise specified in the annual appropriations bill. A portion of the overall Dental budget line is reserved for inherently federal functions and is therefore retained by the IHS to perform the basic operational services of the Agency. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2023 budget submission for Dental is $309 million which is $ 73 million above the FY 2022 Enacted level . FY 20 22 B ase Funding of $236 million will support oral health care services provided by IHS and t ribal programs, maintain the program's progress in raising the quality of and access to oral care through continuing recruitment of oral health care professionals to meet workforce needs, and to meet or exceed agency targets. FY 2023 Funding Increase of $73 million includes : C urrent Services : +$11 million for current services including: o P ay Costs +$ 7 million - to fund pay increases for federal and Tribal employees, of whom approximately 90 percent are working at the service unit level providing health care and related services. o I nflation +$626,000 - to fund inflationary costs of providing health care services. o P opulation Growth +$4 million - to fund the additional service needs arising from the growing AI/AN population. The IHS projects a population growth rate of 1.8 percent in CY 2023 based on state births and deaths data. S taffing for New Facilities: +$ 14 million - these funds will support staffing and operating costs for new and replacement projects listed below. Funding for new/renovated facilities CJ - 96allows IHS to expand provision of health care in those areas where capacity has been expanded to address health care needs. The following table displays this request. New Facilities Amount FTE/Tribal Positions Naytahwaush Health Center (JV), Naytahwaush, MN $1,409 NEACC River) Health Center, Scottsdale, AZ $2,213 ,000 14 Ysleta Del Sur Health Center (JV), El Paso, TX $285,000 2 Alternative Rural Health Center, Dilkon, AZ $1,333,000 Elbowoods Memorial Health Center (JV), New Town, ND $3,112,000 20 Rapid City Health Center, Rapid City, SD $5,997,000 57 Grand Total: $14,329,000 113 G eneral Program Increase : +$33 million to expand access to dental health services in American Indian and Alaska Native communities by addressing the unmet need for direct health care services identified by the FY 2018 Indian Health Care Improvement Fund Work Group. IHS and Tribal health programs can use these funds to develop new dental health programs, increase the size and scope o f existing dental health programs, grow number of dental health professionals serving Indian Country, and other related activities based on the unique needs of the American Indian and Alaska Native communities they serve. This funding increase will support an estimated 1,001,481 patient visits and 3,149,545 total dental services provided in FY 2023. T argeted Dental Health : +$15 million, for critical program improvements to increase implementation of the Electronic Dental Record, expand Dental Clinical and Preventive Support Center Grants, modernize existing dental infrastructure for post-pandemic improvements, and other activities. C ontinued IHS Dentrix Electronic Dental Record Implementation and Modernization ($3 million): Implement the IHS Dentrix EDR t o as many IHS I/T/U dental clinics as possible to maximize standardization of the IHS EDR system in preparation for the IHS Electronic Health Record modernization. Funds will also support IHS enhancements of the commercially available Dentrix Enterprise ( DXE) version, which significantly improves the efficiency and standardization of dental charting documentation, data collection, and automation of information reporting capability of the IHS DXE EDR version when compared to the commercial version. I ncreased funding level of the Dental Clinical and Preventive Support Center Program grants and program awards ($3 million) : The IHS Dental Clinical and Preventive Support Centers (DCPSC) have demonstrated the ability to increase Tribal communities' access to oral health promotion/disease prevention services, resulting in improved oral, and overall, health status of the AI/AN population. While each DSC received an increased funding level in FY21, an increased level of DSC annual funding would further incre ase the access to OHP/DP services, with the expected result of additional improvements in the oral health status of AI/AN communities. E xpansion of the IHS Continuing Dental Education (CDE) Program ($500,000) : The IHS Division of Oral Health CDE Program c onsists of 300 in-person and webinar- based courses each year, with 30,000 CDE participant hours awarded each year to I/T/U dental staff. Over two -thirds of all I/T/U dental staff participate in CDE activities. The CDE CJ - 97program needs to be augmented to improve the delivery of care and access to care in the AI/AN population. Specifically, dental assistants providing basic services and expanded functions (fillings or cleanings) are critical to improving access and delivery of dental services. A study conducted by Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health showed that efficient expanded function dental assistants in the IHS system can increase access to dental services by 10 percent or more. P urchase of Portable Dental Equipment to increase community and school based dental services outreach in AI/AN communities ($1 million) : The goal of the IHS Dental Health Program is to improve the access and quality of oral health care services to communities served by I/T/U dental programs. The increased availability of strategically staged portable oral health care delivery equipment to support community and school- based outreach programs. The availability of this equipment will further enhance our outreach relationship with BIE schools. I ncrease fund ing for the IHS Dental Externship Program ($200,000) : The IHS Dental recruitment program receives approximately 300 applicants per year from dental students from the 66 US Dental schools. The goal is to place dental students so that there is representatio n in the selection pool from all schools from which we receive applications. This creates ambassadors that return to the dental schools that can share their experience with other classmates during their 4 th and final year of dental school. In 2013 the IHS placed 133 dental students in dental externship opportunities. In 2019, the IHS placed 100 dental student in externships. Travel costs have escalated over the last 8 years leading to a reduction in the number of students placed and more out of pocket trave l costs for some participants. A $200,000 increase would allow IHS to increase the allocation to the 100 dental extern travelers we currently place as well as allow IHS to offer placement for up to 30 more dental externs. M odernization to existing dental physical infrastructure to accommodate necessary improvements for post-pandemic dental operations ($7.3 million) : In order to make physical plant enhancements and remodeling for a post -pandemic dental operations, this allocation will be distributed to IHS and Tribal programs will allow them to begin the process of taking action to mitigate the impact future pandemics may have on their ability to provide oral health care services.

For a five-year cycle starting December 1, 2020, six grant awards were made, at an annual funding level of $350,000 each, with the purpose being to establish DSC Programs. $1,000,000 of new FY 2021 funding for DSCs w as utilized to increase the number of DSCs and the grant funding to each DSC , resulting in an expansion of services to AI/AN communities. The DSCs combine IHS and tribal resources and infrastructure in order to address broad challenges and opportunities associated with preventive and clinical dental programs. The DSCs also rigorously measure and evaluate their work with the goal of demonstrably improving dental health outcomes through the technical assistance and services they provide. The DHP has created an online reporting system which will streamline the process by which the DSCs will submit their quarterly progress reports, and will allow the DHP to efficiently collate and analyze DSC achievements. Centers may work simultaneously to improve many different dental programs in a region, providing support, guidance, traini ng, and enhancement to these programs, which then provide services to patients.

Direct Federal; P.L. 93-638 Self- Determination compacts and contracts ; Tribal shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Service ( IHS) Mental Health/Social Services (MH/SS) program is a community- based clinical and preventive service program that provides ongoing vital outpatient mental health counseling and access to dual diagnosis services, mental health crisis response and triage, case management services, community -based prevention programming, and outreach and health education activities. The MH/SS program su pports several of the HHS Strategic Plan goals and objectives, including Objective 1.3: Expand equitable access to comprehensive, community-based, innovative, and culturally-competent healthcare services while addressing social determinants of health ; and, Objective 1.4: Drive the integration of behavioral health into the healthcare system to strengthen and expand access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment and recovery services for individuals and families. The most common MH/SS p rogram model is an outpatient service staffed by one or more mental health professionals providing individual, family, and group psychotherapeutic services and case management. After hours emergency services are generally provided through local emergency departments and contracts with non- IHS hospitals and crisis centers. Inpatient services are generally purchased from non-IHS hospitals or provided by state or county hospitals providing mental health services. Intermediate level services such as group homes, tr ansitional living support, intensive case management, and related activities are typically offered through state and local resources. Additionally, slightly more than one- half of the T ribes administer and deliver their own mental health programs. IHS continues to support T ribal communities in their ability to address the mental health disparities experienced among the AI/AN population. In partnership with T ribal community entities , a collaborative community of learning will support IHS efforts to promote excellence and quality through the development of innovative, community -based projects to expand mental health services and treatment in integrated clinical settings . CJ - 101PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Suicide Prevention: Suicide rates among AI/ANs are historically higher than other minorities within the U.S. population. As of 2020, AI/AN have the highest rate (23.9 per 100,000),1 and the rate has increase 55.7 percent over the past ten years. 2 As of 2020, suicide rates f or AI/AN adolescents and young adults has reached all -time highs, with 24.6 suicides per 100,000 among 15 to 24 year old AI/AN, and 29.8 per 100,000 among 25 to 34 year old AI/AN. The adolescent rates are 1.9 times higher than the national average for othe rs in the same age group, and 2.1 times higher than the national average for other young adults.3 Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death among all AI/AN across all ages.4 Strategies to address behavioral health, alcohol, substance use disorder, and suicide prevention require comprehensive clinical strategies, and approaches. In 2019, AI/AN adolescents (12 to 17 year olds) had the highest prevalence (11.5 percent) of major depressive episode with severe impairment compared to other ethnicities.5 In 2019, AI/AN adults had the highest prevalence (9.4 percent) of major depressive episode with or without severe impairment compared to other ethnicities. 6 Furthermore in 2019, AI/AN adults had the second highest prevalence (18.7 percent) of serious menta l illness among U.S. adults compare to other ethnicities.7 The IHS utilizes and promotes collaborations and partnerships with patients and their families, including Tribes and Tribal organizations, Urban Indian organizations , federal, state, and local agencies, as well as public and private organizations. The IHS initiated a suicide surveillance data protocol focusing on suicide related behaviors to identify suicide within the IHS Electronic Health Records (EHR) in a standardized and systematic fashion. The suicide surveillance protocol will capture data related to suicide ideation; suicide attempts; and other suicide related behaviors through the use of a universal screening and associated clinical pathways to better understand local facility challenges, identify risk factors and target resources and services appropriately. Ten percent of those who die by suicide had visited the emergency department within 2 months of death . In FY 2019, the IHS and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) partnered by way of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to address the high rates of suicide impacting the AI/AN communities. Throughout the three year partnership (FY 2019 - 2021), IHS and NIH worked together to implement the Ask Suicide Screening Questions (ASQ) and its accompanying toolkit for universal screening within IHS Emergency Departments (EDs) . The ASQ is a suicide screening resource developed by NIMH for medical settings to help nurses or physicians successfully identify individuals at risk for suicide. In FY 2019, IHS conducted a site visit and staff training on the ASQ, and partnered with IHS OIT to fully integrate the 1 US Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Available from screening instrument into the IHS electronic health records syst em for field implementation. In FY 2020, IHS began reviewing preliminary surveillance data associated with the ASQ screening and suicide risk assessment. The implementation of the ASQ has allowed for identification of crisis situations within the pilot s ites and supported immediate response by the Area office to ensure quality of care. To date, the pilot sites have completed 55,636 suicide risk screenings . Preliminary findings indicate screening AI/AN youth for suicide risk in the ED is important because rates are high, screening is feasible and, with iterative Quality Improvement processes, can be conducted in a way that will not overburden already busy IHS healthcare systems. Due to the impact of COVID -19, suicide screening has increased and has shown an increase in the need for behavioral health services such as telehealth and virtual outreach to augment traditional service modalities. These efforts support several HHS Strategic Plan goals and objectives, including Objective 1.3: Expand equitable acces s to comprehensive, community- based, innovative, and culturally -competent healthcare services while addressing social determinants of health; and, Objective 4.3: Strengthen surveillance, epidemiology, and laboratory capacity to understand and equitably address diseases and conditions . Zero Suicide Initiative: In FY 2017, IHS received $3.6 million to fund 8 pilot IHS and T r ibal sites to participate in its first cohort of the Zero Suicide Initiative. The Zero Suicide philosophy is a key concept of the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention (NSSP) and is a priority of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention (Action Alliance). Zero Suicide focuses on developing a system -wide approach to improving care for individuals at risk of suicide who are currently utilizing health and behavioral health systems. Health care systems are uniquely poised to identify those struggling with thoughts of suicide considering 50 percent of those who die by suicide had contact with a primary care provider within 1 month of suicide. Furthermore, 80 percent of those who die by suicide had contact with a primary care provider within 1 year of suicide. In FY 2017- FY 2020, IHS funded eig ht facilities in total, five Tribal and three federal facilities, at $400,000 , to implement the Zero Suicide Initiative (ZSI) m odel within their healthcare system. Each ZSI project plan includes utilizing evidence -based treatments in suicide care, initiating safety plans with patients at risk for suicide, implementing intensive follow -up upon missed or cancelled appointment s, universal suicide screening of all at -risk patients, increasing restriction of lethal means, implementing intensive case management, and initiating follow up with patients within 24 hours of transition of care. In year two , all project sites have successfully established a new Zero Suicide policy and have d eveloped suicide risk screening procedures, clinical pathways, and data collection plans to enhance surveillance and analysis capabilities. Similar to other grant programs, t he COVID -19 pandemic placed an unforeseen hardship on all facilitie s implementing ZSI in their Emergency Departments. Accordingly, the IHS authorized ZSI grantees one additional project year to continue their approved project activities , through October 31, 2021 . In FY staff in evid ence-based suicide risk and assessment practices and over 10,000 patients received a positive suicide risk screening. Additionally, through ZSI , all sites established a Suicide Team to develop a Zero Suicide Work Plan. Finally, in FY 2022, IHS will fund a new five-year cohort of ZSI projects and will establish a ZSI Coordinating Center that will provide technical assistance to address the unique needs of Tribes and Tribal organizations implementing the ZSI model. The second ZSI cohort will focus on promo ting collaboration with the local, regional and federal health partners. These efforts CJ - 103support several HHS Strategic Plan goals and objectives , including O bjective 1.4: Drive the integration of behavioral health into the healthcare system to strengthen and expand access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment and recovery services for individuals and families .; and, Objective 3.4: Increase safeguards to empower families and communities to prevent and respond to neglect, abuse, and violence, while supporting those who have experienced trauma or violence . Trauma - Informed Care : Trauma Informed Care supports the HHS Strategic Plan, as in the example of Objective 1.4: Drive the integration of behavioral health into the healthcare system to strengthen and expand access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment and recovery services for individuals and families. In 2019, IHS partnered with the University of New Mexico (UNM) to develop a comprehensive online training curriculum rel ated to trauma and trauma- informed care. Topics included an overview for all staff, and specific training tailored to behavioral health staff, healthcare provider staff, non-provider staff, and supervisors. In FY 2021, IHS released 13 Trauma Informed Care on-demand trainings which included 361 attendees. IHS has worked to implement the principles of trauma informed care to ensure its system understands the prevalence and impact of trauma, facilitates healing, avoids re- traumatization, and focuses on strength and resilience. Developing and implementing a trauma informed care approach to address childhood trauma, including historical trauma, is necessary to comprehensively address the root causes of violence, suicide, depression, anxiety, self -harm, and chronic physical diseases. L essons learned from the 2016 Improving Patient Care and the Johns Hopkins University Pediatric Integrated Care Collaborative (PICC) pilot project were used by IHS to incorporate into the new trauma informed care policy in the Indian Health Manual released in FY 2020. In FY 2022, IHS will support the new trauma informed care policy by developing a mandatory on-demand, online training for clinical and non- clinical staff. This training will provide guidance to IHS facilities in delivering trauma -informed care services along with promoting self- care to prevent secondary traumatic stress, which can lead to compassion fatigue and burnout. Behavioral Health Integration Initiative (BH2I) : The statistics facing AI/AN peoples for suicide, alcohol- related deaths , domestic and sexual violence, and homicide require the Indian health system to develop a system of comprehensive screening and effective intervention to reduce morbidity and early mortality. IHS supports changing the paradigm of mental health and substance abuse disorder services from being episodic, fragmented, specialty, or disease focused to incorporating it into the patient -centered medical home. I n FY 2017, IHS to launch the BH2I . BH2I prioritizes integration across the health care system by d evelop ing care teams, strengthen ing infrastructure, and enhanc ing clinical processes to includ e increased depression screenings in primary care clinics. In FY 2020, supporting the HHS Strategic Plan, Objective 1.4: Drive the integra tion of behavioral health into the healthcare system to strengthen and expand access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment and recovery services for individuals and families , IHS continued funding for a total of 12 federal , Tribal, and U rban Indian organizations to integrate behavioral health with primary care services in their local health facilities. In response to the COVID -19 pandemic, these efforts were extended into FY 2021, providing additional time in the project period to comple te proposed activities with a focus on meeting the needs of the community and developing sustainability plans. Technical assistance (TA) provided to each grantee focused on integrated care with expert psychiatrists, primary care physicians, and social workers. In addition, cross -site evaluation among the BH2I projects identified enhanced integration assessment tools, evidence -based CJ - 104practices applicable to an integrated behavioral and primary care environment, best practices for priority objectives including an emphasis on co -located physical space, implementing measurement -based care using a practice management system for clinical measures and validated tools. BH2I projects reported structural successes including integration policies and procedures such as same day access to behavioral health providers within primary care and emergency room settings. Sites also reported increased screening rates for depression, anxiety, trauma and early childhood development d isabilities and reduction in wait times to see a mental health counselor and psychiatrist with some sites focused on sustainability strategies. In FY 2022, IHS awarded 14 new BH2I grantees, totaling $5.5 million, which will be on a five- year funding cycle through FY 2026. Additionally, IHS will contract with a technical assistance provider to assist grantees with the implementation of integrated care efforts. Reflective of the Agency 's priority to raise the menta l health of the AI/AN population IHS Division of Behavioral Health initiative s have focused on increased implementation of depression screening in primary care clinics. In FY 2020, IHS report ed 41.1 percent of AI/AN adults over the age of 18 screened for depression using a standardized screening assessment for depression. In FY 2020, this same measure was reported for youth ages 12 -17 and data indicated 32.5 percent of eligible youth were screened for depression. For FY 2020, targets were based on prior year results and results indicate the targets were not met for both measures. The FY 2022 targets are set in consideration of the most recent results. According to CDC, racial and ethnic minority groups have experienced disparities in mental health and substance misuse related to access to care, psychological stress, and social determinants of health. In FY 2021, IHS partnered with the Northwest Portland Indian Health Board to launch a free 24/7 Crisis Text Line for AI/ANs, which includes texting the keywords \"Native\" and \"Indigenous\" to 741-741. The Crisis Text Line connects individuals to a live, trained Crisis Counselor allowing for an increase in access to care and support during the COVID -19 pandemic. TeleB ehavioral Health and Workforce Develop ment : The IHS TeleBehavioral Health Center of Excellence (TBHCE) was established in 2009, utilizing funds from the Methamphetamine and Suicide Prevention Initiative, to assess the feasibility of providing behavioral health services via televideo. Due to the rural nature of many IHS and T ribal facili ties, I/T/U patients face many issues surrounding access to care, particularly specialty care. P roviders working in these remote areas often face barriers to maintaining the required c ontinuing education (CE) credit s required for licensure and remaining up to date on current clinical guidelines . The TBHCE assists IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian organizations providers and facilities in overcoming these challenges by providing a range of telebehavioral health ser vices and virtual training. There are 22 sites receiving direct care services through the TBHCE. These services include, adult counseling, child counseling, family counseling, trauma/P ost Traumatic Stress Disorder (P TSD ) counseling, child psychiatry, adult psychiatry, and addiction psychiatry. In FY 2021, the TBHCE provided 64,078 hours of telebehavioral health services. A dditionally, the TBCHE host ed webinars designed to meet the specific training needs of IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian (I/T/U) health care providers. More specifically, IHS utilizes tele- education (otherwise known as distance learning) to deliver national continuing education (CE) programming to I/T/U healthcare providers. In FY 2021, ed 75 webinars that included 4,751 attendees. Webinar topics were designed to assist communities in their response and recovery efforts due to COVID -19. TBHCE included topics on grief and loss, suicide prevention, domestic violence, and engaging patients in telehealth. CJ - 105 In FY 2021, TBHCE in partnership with the University of New Mexico provided a Mental Health and Resiliency ECHO in response to COVID-19. The ECHO aimed to support healthcare providers in treating the mental health concerns of AI/AN patients and supporting peers during the pandemic crisis and consequences, while also managing their own wellbeing. The ECHO included 21 sessions with 1,131 attendees. Finally , TBHCE developed and maintains the online IHS Essential Training on Pain and Addiction. In FY 2021, 321 I/T/U providers completed this five-hour training. Additionally, 403 I/T/U providers completed the TBHCE hosted Essential Training on Pain and Addiction Refresher course. COVID-19 The COVID -19 pandemic has disproportionately affected AI/AN populations across the country. Data indicates AI/ANs have infection rates over 3.5 times higher than non -Hispanic whites, are over four times more likely to be hospitalized as a result of COVID -19, and have higher rates of mortality at younger ages than non -Hispanic whites. The IHS continues to work closely with our Tribal partners, Urban Indian Organizations, state, and local public health officials to coordinate a comprehensive public health r esponse to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. During FY 2020 and early FY 2021, the Indian health care system has modified health care delivery and adapted programming to address COVID-19. This budget narrative may include examples of how care or programming was adapted to address COVID -19. Please refer to the Overview of Agency Performance for additional information about the IHS COVID -19 Response. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount 2019 $101,255 ,000 2020 $109,036,000 2021 Final 2023 President's Budget $199,0 88,000 TRIBAL SHARES Mental Health funds are subject to Tribal shares and are transferred to Tribes when they assume the responsibility for operating the associated programs, functions, services, and activities , unless otherwise specified in the annual appropriations bill. A portion of the overall Mental Health budget line is reserved for inherently federal functions and is therefore retained by the IHS to perform the basic operational services of the Agency. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2023 budget submission for Mental Health is $199 million, which is $77 million above the FY 202 2 Enacted level . FY 20 22 B ase Funding of $122 million - This funding will maintain the program's progress in addressing mental health needs by improving access to behavioral health services through tele- CJ - 106behavioral health efforts and providing a comprehensive array of preventive, educational, and treatment services. FY 2023 Funding Increase of $77 mi llion includes: C urre nt Services : +$5 million for current services including: o P ay Costs +$ 3 million - to fund pay increases for federal and Tribal employees, of whom approximately 90 percent are working at the service unit level providing health care and related services. o I nflation +$349,000 - to fund inflationary costs of providing health care services. P opulation Growth +$2 million - to fund the additional service needs arising from the growing AI/AN population. The IHS projects a population growth rate of 1.8 percent in CY 2022 based on state births and deaths data. S taffing for New Facilities: + $5 million - t hese funds will sup port staffing and operating costs for new and replacement projects listed below. Funding for new/renovated facilities allows IHS to expand provision of health care in those areas where capacity has been expanded to address health care needs. The followin g table displays this request. New Facilities Amount FTE/Tribal Positions Naytahwaush Health Center (JV), Naytahwaush, MN Health Center, AZ $709,000 6 Ysleta Del Sur Health Center (JV), El Paso, TX $172,000 1 Alternative Rural Health Center, Dilkon, AZ $482,000 4 Rapid City Health Center, R apid City, SD $3,164,000 32 Grand Total: $5,034 ,000 48 P artially Sustain ARPA Investments : +$67 million - to partially sustain the ARPA mental health investments and preven t a significant reduction in mental health services. This funding level will support an estimated 1,183,698 mental health services in FY 2023. T he American Rescue Plan Act provided a historic investment in mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services for American Indians and Alaska Natives. The IHS distributed the $420 million appropriated in the ARPA to all IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian Heath programs. However, the ARPA appropriation provided one-time, non-recurring funding to support mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services. Ongoing resources are necessary to ensure that IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian health programs do not have to significantly reduce mental health and substance abuse treatment services as the one- time ARPA resources are expended. The ARPA appropriated one amount for both mental health and substance abuse services, while the IHS budget includes two separate lines - one for Mental Health and one for Alcohol and Substance Abuse. The budget assumes an even split of these funds between the two funding lines.

Permanent Allocation Method ......... Direct Federal; P.L. 93-638 Self- Determination contracts and compacts, Tribal Shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Alcohol, substance abuse, and addiction are among the most severe public health and safety problems facing American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) individuals, families, and communities. The purpose of the Indian Health Service (IHS) Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) is to raise the health status of AI/AN communities to the highest p ossible level through a comprehensive array of preventive, educational, and treatment services that are community-driven and culturally competent. The ASAP addresses several of the HHS Strategic Plan goals and objectives, including Objective 1.3: Expand e quitable access to comprehensive, community-based, innovative, and culturally-competent healthcare services while addressing social determinants of health ; and, Objective 1.4: Drive the integration of behavioral health into the healthcare system to strengt hen and expand access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment and recovery services for individuals and families. These collaborative activities strive to integrate substance abuse treatment into primary care. For instance, the Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention Program (SASP) provides prevention and intervention resources developed and delivered by local community partners to address the dual crises of substance abuse and suicide in AI/AN communities. AI/AN populations suffer disproportionately from substance use disorders (SUD) compared with other racial groups in the United States (U.S.) . Research has consistently found that AI/AN experience higher rates of substance use compared with the U.S. general population. Findings from the 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) reported the rate of AI/ANs aged 12 and over with an alcohol use disorder (6.4 percent ) is higher than that of the total population (5. 3 percent ). 1 In 2017, the Centers for Disease Contr ol and Prevention (CDC) reported that the AI/AN population had the second highest overdose rates from all opioids (15.7 deaths/ 100,000 popu lation), and the highest rate from prescription opioids (7.2 deaths/100,000 population) during 2016-20172. The overall rate of overdose deaths for AI/ANs increased 13 age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths was 9.6 percent higher than the rate for 2016. During that time, deaths rose more than 500 percent among AI/ANs. Due to misclassification of race and ethnicity on death certificates, the actual number of deaths for AI /ANs may be underestimated by up to 35 percent.3 Additionally, in a recent study by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), deaths involving methamphetamines more than quadrupled among non-Hispanic AI/AN from 2011-2018 (from 4.5 to 20.9 per 100,000 people) overall. 4 PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS As alcohol and substance abuse prevention and treatment have transitioned from IHS direct care services to local community control via tribal contracting and compacting, IHS' role has shifted to providing support to enable communities to plan, develop, and implement culturally informed programs. Organized to develop programs and program leadership, the major IHS ASAP activities and focus areas are: Integrated Substance Abuse Treatment in Primary Care : IHS continues to support the integration of substance abuse treatment into primary care and acute care servic es. Integrating treatment into ambulatory health care offers immediate and same-day opportunities for health care providers to identify patients with SUDs , provide them with medical advice, help them communicate the health risks and consequences, obtain substance abuse consultations, and refer patients with more severe substance use- related problems to treatment.5 One integration activity is the implementation of the Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) instrument . SBIRT is an early intervention and treatment service for people with SUD and those at risk of developing these disorders. IHS has broadly promot ed SBIRT as an integral part of a sustainable, primary care- based activity that aims to support and integrate behavioral health into overall care. SBIRT is eligible for reimbursement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). IHS has incorporated SBIRT as a Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) national measure to be tracked and reported. Since FY 2018, the official GPRA measures have been calculated through the Integrated Data Collection System Data Mart (IDCS DM) utilizing National Data Warehouse (NDW) data. IHS facilities and participating tribal facilities are required to submit data into the NDW throughout the year. In FY 2020, the SBIRT screening measure was utilized in 14. 9 percent of the patient visits for those ages 9 through 75. The target for this measure was 12.2 percent, therefore IHS efforts exceeded the expected percent of patients to be screened using the SBIRT. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, IHS increased efforts to expand telehealth capacity across Indian Health Service/Tribal/Urban Indian Organizations (I/T/Us) to continue coordination of treatment and services to patients. Additionally, IHS continues to monitor the SBIRT administered through telehealth methods. IHS provides annual national training on SBIRT use, including guidelines for improved clinical documentation in the electronic health record. In FY 2020, IHS increased efforts that broadly promote the SBIRT measure to achieve targets at the regional and local levels, including a more focused education campaign on the importance of early detection and intervention using SBIRT screening among IHS operated programs. In addition, IHS is actively working to expand local SBIRT use, including a focus on substance use in women of childbearing age, to assist in early identification and referral for treatment and reduce illicit perinatal substance exposure for infants. 3 https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/ss/pdfs/ss6619.pdf 4 https://jamanetwork -com.ezproxyhhs.nihlibrary.nih.gov/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2774859 5 U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy. Integrating Treatment into Healthcare. Available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/integrating- treatment -and-healthcare. CJ - 111Increasing access to Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) : IHS is committed to assuring access to MAT for patients struggling with opioid use disorder (OUD). The IHS strategy focuses on creating community and clinical resources and technical a ssistance to share best and promising practices. IHS continues to host the Pain & Opioid Use Disorder webinar and continuing education series. FY2021 MAT sessions included Buprenorphine Micro- inductions and MAT in the Emergency Department Setting . In tandem, IHS is expanding integrated team- based care models. In April 2021, the IHS Advancing Pharmacist Roles in Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery Teams learning model launched. Participants engage in a learning collaborative to increase knowledge surrounding patient screening, assessments, evidence- based practices for the management of OUDs , and trauma -informed care principles. A total of 307 continuing education credits have been issued in the first six months of the program. This pro ject is also exploring methods to expand tele-MAT services using hub-and-spoke information distribution models. I HS is working to expand access to MAT in acute care settings. In December 2021, the IHS Pain and Addiction Care in the Emergency Department pilot program intervention funded five projects in direct- service e mergency departments. The objective of this intervention is to improve access to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) or improve pain management outcomes in acute care settings. Secondary objectives are to leverage the opioid surveillance dashboard to inform stewardship activities, to create a learning collaborative to share promising practices, and to assist sites with obtaining relevant accreditation. IHS has partnered with the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board and the Clinician Consultation Center to facilitate I/T/U clinician access to free Substance Disorder tele - consultation services. These services are intended to assist clinicians with patient treatment planning, facilitate didactic learning, and provide support for health systems that desire to create local protocols. IHS continues to host training sessions for clinicians to receive the Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) 2000 waiver to prescribe buprenorphine, and in FY 2018 added buprenorphine- containing medication and injectable naltrexone to the IHS National Core Formulary. In FY 2020, the IHS continues to evaluate new long- acting MAT therapies for inclusion on the National Core Formulary and creates formulary briefs and technical assistance to incorporate these new treatments into practice. In June 2019, the IHS released the Special General Memorandum Assuring Access to MAT for OUD that requires f ederal IHS facilities to create an action plan to identify local MAT resources and coordinate patient access to these services when indicated to assure equitable access to MAT services. 6 In addition, IHS created workforce development strategies that include SUD training for healthcare workers and technical assistance materials that support sites with integrated SUD approaches to care. To address challenges that limit access to recovery services in remote and rural IHS locations and villages, the IHS released an Internet Eligible Controlled Substance Prescriber Designation (IECSP) policy in the Indian Health Manual (Chapter 38) to assure access to MAT using telemedicine models for remotely located Tribal members.7 In January 2020, an IHS telehealth toolkit for MAT services was created and shared on the ihs.gov/opioids website. These resources assist prescribers and sites with creating tele- MAT services and implementing provisions within the IECSP policy. Additionally, a webinar was hosted in February 2020 to describe available policies. In March 2019, the IHS released the Recommendations to the Indian Health Service on American Indian/Alaska Native Pregnant Women and Women of Childbearing Age with Opioid Use Disorder developed in collaboration with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' (ACOG) Committee on AI/AN Women's Health.8 This resource will help providers improve maternal participation in early prenatal care and support, improve screening for SUD, and increase access to MAT for pregnant women and women of child- bearing age. The goal of these clinical recommendations is to foster relationships and improve awareness surrounding trauma-informed approaches to maternal opioid use that may lead to recovery, hope, and healing. Additionally, the IHS and the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Native American Child Health (CONACH) recently released the Recommendations to the Indian Health Service on Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome that includes clinical recommendations on the prevention and management of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. 9 These recommendations provide standards of care for screening, diagnosing, support, and treatment of pregnant mothers and infants affected by prenatal opioid exposure IHS has also created a robust workforce development strategy to include didactic training. In September 2019, IHS launched its Pain Management and Opioid Use Disorder Continuing Medical Education webinar series. The IHS has hosted learning sessions in this series that include buprenorphine prescribing in pregnancy, dental acute pain management recommend ations, as well as , an auricular acupuncture -training program. For example, Implementing an Integrated MAT Model- A Review of Resources, Assessment and Treatment of Pain and Co-occurring OUD In Individual with Serious Mental Illness, and Treatment of OUD in the ED, Should it be a Choice? The IHS has expanded access to harm reduction interven tions that include increased access to the opioid overdose reversal medication, naloxone. In 2015, the IHS signed a memorandum of agreement with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The agreement allows IHS to provide BIA Law Enforcement Officers (LEO) wi th training and naloxone rescue kits for responding to incidents of opioid overdose. Between 2015 and 2017, this partnership trained and put naloxone in the hands of 324 BIA LEOs, who are often the first responders to incidents of opioid overdose in Triba l communities. In 2017, IHS turned the naloxone training program over to the BIA after certifying 48 BIA LEOs as naloxone trainers. IHS continues to support this program by re-supplying naloxone rescue kits to BIA LEO first responders as needed. In 2019, IHS conducted first -responder train-the- trainer sessions on naloxone and harm reduction strategies for community health workers from IHS and T ribal sites from across the country. During that training , 86 community workers were supplied with naloxone kit s and certified to offer naloxone training within their local communities. IHS also supports naloxone co- prescribing and has created sample collaborative practice agreements to engage pharmacists in naloxone distribution efforts and has hosted an IHS Gran d Rounds on naloxone co- prescribing to increase provider awareness of this life- saving procedure. A First Responder Toolkit that includes a training video, a law enforcement testimonial video, customizable forms, and a train -the trainer curriculum was created to support naloxone deployment in T ribal communities. The IHS formally expanded access to naloxone in March 2018 through a policy titled Prescribing and Dispensing of Naloxone to First Responders , which require s IHS federal pharmacies to provide naloxone to all Tribal law enforcement agencies and other trained first responders. These efforts have resulted in a 143 percent increase in naloxone procurement across IHS facilities that utilize the Prime Vendor. 8 https://www.ihs.gov/sites/opioids/theme s/responsive2017/display_objects/documents/acogguidelines2018.pdf 9 https://www.ihs.gov/sites/opioids/themes/responsive2017/display_objects/documents/aapnowsrecommendationstoihs.pdf CJ - 113IHS has further adapted the toolkit and strategy to equip community first responders and paraprofessionals with training on opioid overdose response and naloxone. These expanded collaborations with local law enforcement and community first responders resulted in an initial pilot community -health naloxone train-the-trainer program to include naloxone distribution. In December 2021, IHS revised the IHS Naloxone webpage to share technical assistance and resources to support access to naloxone and opioid overdose prevention strategies. IHS collaborat ed with the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board to record a virtual naloxone train-the-trainer program as free technical assistance to T ribes to support access to naloxone in a virtual/contactless approach. In addition to the naloxone distribution, IHS expanded harm reduction strategies to include an evaluation of Safe Syringe Services. In FY 2020, IHS released a Safe Syringe Services toolkit that includes sample patient education pamphlets, a review of available resources, and inform ation related to creating program financial sustainability. These expanded harm reduction services will support IHS Hepatitis C Elimination and HIV/AIDS efforts . In FY 2022, the IHS hosted technical assistance and resources to expand access to fentanyl test strips. Proper Pain Management , O pioid Stewardship and Training: The IHS has created and released a comprehensive Opioid Stewardship workbook to assist sites with creating best practices surrounding safe opioid prescribing and increasing access to integrative pain treatments. The workbook emphasizes utilizing opioid surveillance strategies to evaluate population health outcomes, target opioid interventions, enhance clinical decision support, and create professional practice evaluation strategies. The IHS opioid stewardship program evaluation considers metrics that evaluate trends in Morphine Milligram Equivalents versus a restricted focus on total opioid prescription fills. The IHS developed a total of fifteen opioid prescribing metric definitions for inclusion in the IHS Opioid Prescribing dashboard. The dashboard unde rwent a limited release in September 2021 and an Opioid Stewardship and Dashboard working group was created to develop dashboard super- users within each IHS region to support implementation, including clinician end-user training and applying population health/opioid stewardship principles and clinical decision support tools. These super -users will also suggest additional metrics to optimize dashboard utility at the local level. In July 2021, the IHS Academic Detailing Service pilot project was established in the Bemidji Area. Two IHS sites were selected to create tailored peer -to-peer interventions to support opioid stewardship activities, increase access to treatment services, and promote quality of care. Sample action plans and evaluation strategies ar e being developed to be shared with other IHS regions and programs. The IHS has also increased access to non -pharmacologic pain management approaches. The IHS has collaborated with the Defense Veterans Center for Integrated Pain Management to expand access to focused auricular acupuncture through the creation of sample credentialing and privileging processes, protocols, documentation standards, and sustainability recommendations. Access to additional integrative pain management strategies such as dry needling, deep tissue mobilization, and electrical stimulation have increased. IHS has created agency policy and clinical practice recommendations to improve patient outcomes and reduce unnecessary opioid exposure. In June 2014, IHS implemented Indian Health Manual Chapter 30 policy titled Chronic Non- Cancer Pain Management to promote appropriate pain management with revision in 2018 to align with CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. This policy will be revised in FY 2021 to include e nhanced recommendations related to de -prescribing and medical cannabis. The impact of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) on safe opioid prescribing is well documented. IHS implemented Chapter 32, State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs, requiring providers to CJ - 114check state PDMP data bases prior to prescribing opioids and requiring IHS federal pharmacies to report opioid prescribing data to these state PDMPs. Ongoing improvements to automate reporting electronic integration and audit report ing were funded in FY 2021 with implem entation in FY 2022. In May 2016, IHS implemented a policy on mandatory opioid training requiring all federally controlled substance prescribers to complete the IHS Essential Training on Pain and Addiction with req uired refresher training every 3 years. This training is now available on demand with continuing medical education credits. The IHS released its refresher training course in January 2018 including four sessions of its mandatory five-hour training course for providers on proper opioid prescribing. The refresher course was updated in FY 2021. In FY 2021, 276 new clinicians completed this course. The mandate also includes an additional refresher training after three years. In FY 2021, 327 clinicians completed the Essential Training on Pain and Addiction Refresher course. In F Y 2020, course content was updated based on prescriber evaluations. These revisions include expanded modules on managing pain in special populations (e.g., older adults, pregnancy, SUD) as well as content on effective de- prescribing strategies. In FY 2021, IHS engaged in planning discussions with the Veterans Health Administration to promote synergy between safe opioid prescriber training curriculums. A revised training course is anticipated in July 2022. In August 2021, the IHS released enhanced clinical decision support tools for t he Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) to assist providers in meeting documentation standards outlined in IHM, Part 3 - Chapte r 30. The EHR Reminders and dialog note templates facilitate accurate and timely documentation to support best practices and implementation of pain management policy requirements. Improved Communication Related to Opioid Strategies: Enhanced communication during the opioid crisis response is vital to program development, policy implementation, and ongoing evaluation. The IHS creat ed and released an Opioid Information Sheet that will serve as a public-facing logic model to share opioid- related measures, agency goals, and available resources for both clinicians and Tribal stakeholders. IHS supports efforts to develop a unified user experience that includes an expanded website presence with best and promising practices and a communication plan to increase public awareness of agency opioid efforts. This website houses resources, clinical guidelines, and best practices for IHS providers. Additional communication outputs include maintenance of a listserv, quarterly newsletter, and special editio n newsletters. In December 2021, the IHS developed and released a sample recovery rack card as a health promotion and patient education pamphlet for positive messaging around resilience, treatment, and recovery. The resource is downloadabl e on the IHS website and customizable for local use. In October 2021, the IHS developed and released technical assistance to address site challenges with procurement of long -acting formulations of buprenorphine. Long-acting buprenorphine was added to the IHS National Core Formulary in August 2021. In FY 2020, the IHS expanded websites to include a new technical assistance page that will share best and promising practices related to clinical documentation, sample documentation templates and how-to guides, and links to clinician supports. Future content consolidation will include funding opportunities and promising clinical practices. Also in FY 2020, IHS provided Pain Skills intensive trainings in the Phoenix and Tucson Area and the Navajo Area. These trainings CJ - 115focus on assessment and treatment of myofascial pain, including non-pharmacological interventions. Additionally, they include the half-and- half DATA Waiver training for buprenorphine MAT. A total of 35 clinicians attended these tra inings. In FY 2021, IHS provided five webinars that addressed pain management, opioids, and opioid misuse with a total of 179 attendees. Ketamine in the Acute Care Setting Buprenorphine Micro-Induction Treatment of OUD in the ED, Should it be a Choice? Opioid Management in Primary Care: An Integrated Approach Novel Buprenorphine Induction Strategies IHS has created agency policy and clinical practice recommendations to improve patient outcomes and reduce unnecessary opioid exposure. In June 2014, IHS i mplemented IHM Chapter 30 policy titled Chronic Non- Cancer Pain Management to promote appropriate pain management. IHS released new clinical guidelines to assist dentists with selecting the safest pain control options. The Recommendations for Management of Acute Dental Pain will limit opioid prescribing to patients who cannot safely use alternative pain medication. The guidelines also include a decision tree for pre-operative and post- operative pain management, as well as recommended dosing of systemic analgesics based on anticipated operative pain. Substance Use Disorder and Chronic Pain Case Consultation Services: To provide ongoing clinical support for providers, IHS, in partnership with the University of New Mexico Pain Center, provided a Substance Use Disorder and Chronic Pain ECHO. ECHO is a case- based learning model in which consultation is offered through virtual clinics to health care providers by an expert team to share knowledge and elevate the level of specialty care available to patients. In FY 2021, a total of 20 ECHO sessions w ere offered w ith 748 attendees . Youth Regional Treatment Centers (YRTCs) : YRTCs are facilities which provide medically managed care and other essential treatment and recovery services to AI/AN youth experiencing SUDs . Congress authorized the establishment of YRTCs in each of the 12 IHS Areas, with two (northern and southern) specifically authorized for the California Area. The YRTCs provide quality holistic behavioral health care for AI/AN adolescents that integ rate traditional healing, spiritual values and cultural identification. In FY 2020, all federal YRTCs in operation 18 months or longer have achieved accreditation status. COVID -19 significantly impacted service delivery across all YRTCs . In response to the challenges, YRTCs partnered with IHS, SAMHSA's Office of T ribal Affairs and Policy and the Addic tion Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) Network Coordinating Office to identify and develop r esponse and recovery resources specific to YRTCs continuity of c are. The document, Guidance for Caring for Patients in Youth Regional Treatment Centers During the COVID-19 Pandemic was developed to support the delivery of care among the YRTCs during this ever -evolving situation . 10 In FY 2021, the YRTCs shifted delivery of services to enhance safety measures to prevent the spread of COVID -19 that impacted the census of AI/AN youth receiving treatment. Most YRTCs currently provide treatment in socially distanced settings at their sites. Indian Children's Program (formerly, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD): Training and technical assistance on FASD is provided through the IHS TeleBehavioral Health Center of Excellence (TBHCE) Indian Children Program (ICP). The focus of the ICP is training clinicians 10 https://attcnetwork.org/sites/default/files/2020 -08/YRTC_Document_08_05_20.pdf CJ - 116on developmental and neurobiological AI/AN children. In FY 2021, ICP provided five webinars on Autism Spectrum Disorder with a total of 218 attendees. The ICP provided three webinars on supporting families of children with neurodevelopmental disorders with a total of 78 attendees. The ICP also provides additional clinician supports. For example, clinicians can take advantage of the Pediatric Neurodevelopmental & Behavioral Health Consultation Clinic. This virtual consultation is designed to help clinicians successfully diagnose, manage, and treat AI/AN youth with FASD, ASD, and other neurodevelopmental issues. Information Systems Supporting Behavioral Health Care : T he Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) includes functionality designed to meet the unique business processes of behavioral health providers and support behavioral health -related initiatives. Standardized instruments and clinical decision suppor t tools are available to support routine and effective screening for alcohol and substance use, depression, domestic violence and smoking status. Additionally, surveillance tools are available to capture suicide data at the point of care. Aggregate natio nal RPMS behavioral health data is maintained to support local, national and other program reporting requirements as well as quality performance measurement s for numerous screening and prevention initiatives including screening for alcohol and substance use, depression, domestic violence, smoking, and suicide data collection. Partnerships: IHS is collaborating with other agencies working in the field of SUDs such as Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services A dministration (SAMHSA ), Department of Veteran s Affairs , Health Resources and Services Administration, Office of National Drug Control and Policy, and Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Interior (DOJ), and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) to ensure that the best available information, training s, protocols, evaluations, performance measures, data needs, and management skills are incorporated and shared with all agencies and organizations working on substance use disorders. The DOI , through the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), and IHS ha ve a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) on Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse Prevention , which was amended in 2011 as a result of the permanent reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Through this MOA, BIA, BIE, and IHS coordinate and implement plans in cooperation with T ribes to assist Tribal governments in their efforts to address behavioral health issues. The MOA includes coordination of data collection, resources, and programs of IHS, BIA, and BIE. The Tribal Law and Order Act (TLOA) requires interagency coordination and collaboration among HHS (IHS and SAMHSA), DOI (BIA/BIE), DOJ (Office of Justice Programs/Office of Tribal Justice), and the Office of the Attorney General. The coordination of Federal efforts and resources will assist in determining both the scope of alcohol and substance abuse problems as well as effective prevention and treatment programs. The MOA required by Section 241 of the TLOA was signed on July 29, 2011, by the Sec retaries of the Departments of Health and Human Services , the Interior and the Attorney General to: (1) determine the scope of the alcohol and substance abuse problems faced by Tribes; (2) identify and delineate the resources each entity can bring to bear on the problem; (3) set standards for applying those resources to the problems; and (4) coordinate existing agency programs. In April 2019, IHS expanded collaboration with the Defense Veterans Center for Integrated Pain Management to explore feasibility o f creating an IHS auricular acupuncture program utilizing the Veterans Health Administration Battlefield Acupuncture protocol. IHS has created a pilot program that includes credentialing and privileging processes, clinical practice protocols, CJ - 117documentation standards, patient education materials, and a sustainability plan. The initial training session was hosted in November 2019 and 23 IHS clinicians were certified in this modality. Auricular acupuncture is an evidence- based integrated treatment option an d full implementation would require an IHS Scope of Practice for nurses and pharmacists to deliver this treatment modality. Ninety -six community-health workers completed training as naloxone trainers for their T ribal communities in one week. The train the trainer sessions were migrated to virtual platforms during the COVID pandemic. ASA Grant and Federal Award Programs The IHS Division of Behavioral Health administers community- based grants and cooperative agreements that promote the use and developme nt of evidence -based and practice- based models that represent culturally -appropriate prevention and treatment approaches to substance ab use from a community-driven context. In particular, the IHS Community Opioid Intervention Pilot Program and the Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention P rogram will support several of the HHS Strategic Plan goals and objectives, including Objective 2.3: Enhance promotion of healthy behaviors to reduce occurrence and disparities in preventable injury, illness, and death ; and, Objective 3.4: Increase safeguards to empower families and communities to prevent and respond to neglect, abuse, and violence, while supporting those who have experienced trauma or violence . IHS Community Opioid Intervention Pilot Program (COIPP) : In FY 2021, IHS awarded $16 Million in funding to combat epidemic in AI/AN communities . In FY 2022, IHS continued funding 35 Tribal and urban Indian organizations to support the development of innovative, locally -designed, culturally-appropriate prevention, treatment, recovery, and aftercare services for opioid use disorders. Awarded projects will focus on increasing public awareness and education about the impact of OUD on individuals, families and communities. Additionally, IHS established a contract to provide evaluation technical assistance (TA) to guide this pilot project through a national evaluation. The cross- site evaluation will integrate culturally appropriate care as grantees create comprehens ive support teams to strengthen and empower families addressing the opioid crisis. Finally, all projects will prioritize efforts to reduce unmet needs and opioid overdose deaths through increased access to MAT . The IHS C OIPP is a three year program and par t of the Department of Health and Human Services' five-point strategy to fight the opioid overdose epidemic in America. Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention Program (SASP): The SASP is a nationally -coordinated $31.97 million program providing funds for culturally appropriate substance ab use and suicide prevention programming in AI/AN communities. The program funds 174 projects . In August 2019, IHS initiated Tribal Consultation and an Urban Confer regarding behavioral health initiatives and the National Tribal Advisory Committee on Behavioral Health recommendations regarding the distribution of funding for the SASP program. In total, 22 comments and recommendations were received and reviewed by IHS. On March 2, 2020, the IHS Director issued a decision to continue distribution of the SASP program funds using a competitive grant mechanism . Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the SASP notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) was published in FY 2022. The goals of the SASP program include: 1. Increase IHS, Tribal, and Urban (I/T/U) capacity to operate successful substance abuse prevention, treatment, and aftercare and suicide prevention, intervention, and postvention CJ - 118services through implementing community and organizational needs assessment and strategic plans. 2. Develop and foster data sharing systems among I/T/U behavioral health service providers to demonstrate efficacy and impact. 3. Identify and address suicide ideations, attempts, and contagions among AI/AN populations through the development and implementation of culturally appropriate and community relevant prevention, intervention, and postvention strategies. 4. Identify and address substance use among AI/AN populations through the development and implementation of culturally appropriate and community relevant prevention, treatment, and aftercare strategies. 5. Increase provider and community education on suicide and substance use by offering appropriate trainings. 6. Promote positive AI/AN youth development and family engagement through the implementation of early intervention strategies to reduce risk factors for suicidal behavior and substance use. SASP projects were awarded funding in at least one of four purpose areas and work to address the corresponding SASP goal listed above. SASP Purpose Areas are: 1. Community Needs Assessment and Strategic Planning 2. Suicide Prevention, Intervention, and Postvention 3. Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, and Aftercare 4. Generation Indigenous (Gen- I) Initiative Support Of the projects funded, 19 projects specifically f ocus on substance use prevention, treatment, and aftercare, while 10 7 focus on substance ab use and suicide prevention among Native youth. In support of the SASP, IHS established the Universal Alcohol Screening (UAS) as a national measure to increase screening and improve detection and intervention strategies among patient s 9 through 75 years of age. In FY 2020, 37.1 percent of patients were screened . In 2020, the pandemic impacted IHS primary care and emergency departments clinical settings, therefo re the IHS did not meet the expected screening target of 42.4 percent. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of the 174 SASP projects reduced and/or ceased activities. Only a limited number of projects continued to operate and did so according to t heir local, state, and federal guidelines for COVID-19 by modifying in- person activities to virtual events. In FY 2020, IHS requested and received a one- year extension for all SASP grants from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) due to the impact of COVID-19. In the fourth year of the SASP, 100 percent of projects submitted progress reports as a requirement of funding. Positive strides i n the delivery of substance use services have been accomplished and rep orted in preliminary data monitoring for SASP program activities. Successful outcomes during the fourth year of the program include expanded behavioral health services offered through school settings and home visiting with a total of 1,475 patients receiving care . Over 270 providers were trained in behavioral health integration with 163 of those providers locate d within a primary care setting . Project accomplishments include 67,168 indiv iduals screened for suicidal ideation, 54 percent of the SASP program suicide prevention projects implemented an enhanced process for suicide screening, and over 11,003 community members have been trained in suicide and/or substance use prevention. Fifty three percent of projects hosted a successful prevention education community event, and 59 percent reported their trainings to have expanded staff knowledge (a 12 percent increase from year 2). Twenty nine percent reported implementation and documentation of a system change. In addition, CJ - 119among projects supported, a total of 76,054 individuals received cultural services, a high percentage of projects have continued to offer integrated traditional healing into care, extended service hours, provision of follow- up care, new counseling and case management services. In summary, the SASP program continues to support T ribes, Tribal organizations, urban Indian organizations, and federal facilities offering care. Preventing Alcohol -Related Death s (PARD) : In the 2017 Senate Appropriations Committee Report 114-281, the Committee directed IHS to \"allocate $2,000,000 of the increase provided for the alcohol and substance abuse program to fund essential detoxification and related services.\" Specifically, the number of alcohol related deaths in the community of Gallup, New Mexico was addressed with the report stating, \"these deaths underscore the urgent need for substance abuse treatment, residential services and detoxification services\" in this community. In response, the IHS used the increased appropriated funds to address the urgent need in the city of Gallup. In addition, IHS was aware of the urgent need for alcohol detoxification services in the Great Plains Area after the removal of liquor licenses and alcohol s ales in White Clay, Nebraska, leading to the potential for increased mortality if services were unavailable for alcohol detoxification. As a result, funds were also made available to address this urgent need. The funds provided to Gallup and the Great Pl ains Area (specifically the Oglala Sioux Tribe's Anpetu Luta Otipi) in FY 2017 were to address the need for social detoxification services through a cooperative agreement. The project period is for five years, from September 15, 2017, to September 14, 2022. With the additional funding, the Gallup site reported detoxification services to an average of 26,000 individuals from 2016-2019, with over 75 percent of those clients as males. In addition to services offered for monitoring, supervising, and managing detoxification, this site has increased coordination and transportation with the Gallup Indian Medical Center Emergency Department; and established a contract with the Gallup Police Department to transport patients to the detoxification center. The Great Plains' Antepu Luta Otipi site has used the funding to increase coordination with behavioral health programs, provide screenings and brief interventions to individuals incarcerated in jails, and serve as an immediate placement for individuals who are in need of treatment services following detoxification. In FY 2020, nearly 100 percent of individuals held in detoxification for more than two weeks were successfully admitted into a higher level of residential treatment care for their SUD. In FY 2022, the Antepu Luta Otipi held a grand opening for a new residential and detoxification center in Western Bennett County in South Dakota with a 48 bed capacity. The new residential and detoxification center substantially increases the capacity to serve up to 48 male and female clients simultaneously. During the COVID-19 pandemic, services were temporarily interrupted at the City of Gallup detoxification site , and the Great Plains Anpetu Luta Otipi site . IHS continues to work with both sites to ensure each has adopted guidelines provided by the local and state health departments, and the CDC for continued operations for detoxification programs . YRTC Aftercare Pilot Project: In December 2017, IHS utilized $1.8 million to implement a pilot project for aftercare services for AI/AN youth discharged from residential substance abu se treatment. The purpose of the YRTC Aftercare project is to identify appropriate aftercare services that can be culturally adapted to support AI/AN youth in their recovery journey once they leave YRTC care. Two YRTCs , Desert Sage Youth Wellness Center and Healing Lodge of the Seven Nations , were selected to devel op innovative approaches to aftercare, recovery, and other support services for AI/AN youth that can be used across other YRTCs. These facilities are tasked with implementing best practices around effective reintegration processes while establishing a col laborative partnership and community-based approach to reduce alcohol and substance use relapse. With the additional funding, the two YRTCs have engaged T ribal and urban programs that refer adolescents to the YRTCs, to identify best practices for aftercare. This CJ - 120has resulted in a more focused commitment to improving the coordination around aftercare and case management, training of community supports for the adolescents, identification of transitional living, increas ing awareness of the use of social media, and improv ing follow-up with data collection after discharge. In FY 2021, best practices and lessons learned from the YRTC Aftercare Pilot Project have been evaluated. Findings from the evaluation indicated an urgent need to improve the scope of data collection from the point of the client's treatment and pursuit of employability to the cross -agency administration of program performance; as well as improvements in the continuum of care, to include services that lead to self -management of treatment, emp loyment , and full benefits of services that affect sobriety. COVID-19 The COVID -19 pandemic has disproportionately affected AI/AN populations across the country. Data indicates AI/ANs have infection rates over 3.5 times higher than non -Hispanic whites, are over four times more likely to be hospitalized as a result of COVID -19, and have higher rates of mortality at younger ages than non -Hispanic whites. The IHS continues to work closely with our Tribal partners, Urban Indian Organizations, state, and local public health officials to coordinate a comprehensive public health response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. During FY 2020 and early FY 2021, the Indian health care system has modified health care delivery and adapted programming to address COVID-19. This budget narrative may include examples of how care or programming was adapted to address COVID-19. Please refer to the Overview of Agency Performance for additional information about the IHS COVID -19 Response. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amo unt SASP Gen 2019 20,000 ($15,475,000) ($16,500,000) TRIBAL SHARES Alcohol and Substance Abuse funds are subject to T ribal shares and are transferred to Tribes when they assume the responsibility for operating the associated programs, functions, services, and activities , unless otherwise specified in the annual appropriations bill. A portion of the overall Alcohol and Substance Abuse budget line is reserved for inherently federal functions and is therefore retained by the IHS to perform the basic operational services of the Agen cy. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2023 budget submission for Alcohol and Substance Abuse is $345 m illion , which is $86 million above the FY 2022 Enacted level. FY 20 22 B ase Funding of $258 million - This funding will maintain the program's progress in addressing alcohol and substance abuse needs by improving access to behavioral health services through tele-behavioral health efforts and providing a comprehensive array of preventive, educational, and treatment services. CJ - 121FY 2023 Funding Increase of $86 mi llion includes: C urrent Services : +$9 million for current services including: o P ay Costs +$ 4 million - to fund pay increases for federal and Tribal employees, of whom approximately 90 percent are working at the service unit level providing health care and related services. o I nflation +$790,000 - to fund inflationary costs of providing health care services. P opulation Growth +$9 million - to fund the additional service needs arising from the growing AI/AN population. The IHS projects a population growth rate of 1.8 percent in CY 2022 based on state births and deaths data. S taffing for New Facilities: $855,000 - these funds will support staffing and operating costs for new and replacement projects listed below. Funding for new/renovated facilities allows IHS to expand provision of health care in those areas where capacity has been expanded to address health care needs. The following table displays this request. New Facilities Amount FTE/Tribal Positions Naytahwaush Health Center (JV), Naytahwaush, MN Health Center, AZ $352,000 2 Ysleta Del Sur Health Center (JV), El Paso, TX $67,000 0 Alternative Rural Health Center, Total: $855,000 5 9 million to expand the IHS Opioid Grant program to a total of $ 20 million. These additional resources will support opioid use disorder prevention, treatment, recovery, and aftercare services. Increased funds will prioritize projects targeted at recovery and aftercare practices and efforts by supporting community- based peer recovery training programs. Funds will support access to peer -recovery specialists, including access to training platforms with virtual learning and collaborative support, shared resources, and information. Funds will also provide evaluation and technical assistance for ongoing OUD activities. P artially Sustain APRA Investments : +$67 million - to partially sustain the ARPA Alcohol and Substance Abuse activities, preventing significant reduction in alcohol and substance abuse treatment services. This funding level will support an estimated 116,719 outpatient visits and 2,456 inpatient treatment days in FY 2023. T he American Rescue Plan Act provided a historic investment in mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services for American Indians and Alaska Natives. The IHS distributed the $240 million appropriated in the ARPA to all IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian Heath program s. However, the ARPA appropriation provided one-time, non-recurring funding to support mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services. Ongoing resources are necessary to ensure that IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian health programs do not have to significantly reduce mental health and substance abuse treatment services as the one- time ARPA resources are expended. CJ - 122 The ARPA appropriated one amount for both mental health and substance abuse services, while the IHS budget includes two sepa rate lines - one for Mental Health and one for Alcohol and Substance Abuse. The budget assumes an even split of these funds between the two funding lines. R ealign Funding for Former National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) : -$31,061 - to realign remaining funding for former National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) programs from the Alcohol & Substance Abuse line into the Urban Health line (see Difference column in the table below). This shift reduces administrative burden.

Direct Federal, PL 93- 638 Tribal Contracts and Compacts, Commercial contracts, and Tribal shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Snyder Act provides the formal legislative authority for the expenditure of funds for the \"relief of distress and conservation of health of Indians.\"1 In 1934, Congress provided the specific authority to enter into medical services contracts for American Indians and Alaska Natives.2 These, among other authorities3 established the basis for the Indian Health Service (IHS) and the Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) Program.4 The PRC Program is integral to ensure comprehensive health care services are available and accessible to eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) (IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 and HHS Strategic Plan FY 2022 - 2026 Goal 1: Protect and Strengthen Equitable Access to High Quality and Affordable Healthcare ). The Indian health system delivers care through direct care services provided in an IHS, Tribal or Urban Indian Health Program (I/T/U) facility (e.g., hospitals, clinics) and through PRC services delivered by non-IHS providers to increase access to quality health care services (IHS Strategic Plan 1.3 and HHS Strategic Plan FY 2022 - 2026 Goal 1: Protect and Strengthen Equitable Access to High Quality and Affordable Healthcare ). The general purpose of the PRC Program is for IHS or Tribal facilities to purchase services from private health care providers in situations where: 1) No IHS or Tribal direct care facility exists, 2) The direct care element is not capable of providing required emergency and/or specialty care, 3) The direct care element has an overflow of medical care workload, and 4) Full expenditure of alternate resources (e.g., Medicare, private insurance) has been met and 1 The Snyder Act, Public Law 67-85, November 2, 1921, 25 U.S.C \u00a7 13. 2 The Johnson O'Malley Act of April 16, 1934, as amended, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 452. 3 Transfer Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2001; Indian Health Care Improvement Act, as amended, 25 U.S.C \u00a7 1601, et seq. 4 The Consolidated Appropriation Act of 2014, Public Law 113-76, January 18, 2014, adopted a new name for the IHS Contract Health Services (CHS) program to Purchased/Referred Care (PRC). The IHS will administer PRC in accordance with all law applicable to CHS. CJ - 125s upplemental funds are necessary to provide comprehensive care to eligible Indian people. In addition to meeting the eligibility requirements for direct services at an IHS or Tribal facility, PRC eligibility is determined based on residency within the service unit or Tribal PRC delivery Area; authorization of payment for each recommended medical service by a PRC authorizing official; medical necessity of the service and inclusion within the established Area IHS/Tribal medical/dental priorities; and full expenditure of all alternate resources (i.e., Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, state or other health programs, etc.). Alternate resources must pay for services first because the IHS PRC Program is the payer of last resort.5 Services purchased may include hospital, specialty physician, outpatient, and laboratory, dental, radiological, pharmaceutical, or transportation services. When funds are not sufficient to purchase the volume of PRC services needed by the eligible population residing in the PRC delivery area of the local facility, IHS PRC regulations require IHS or Tribal PRC programs to use a medical priority system to fund the most urgent referrals first. Medical priority (MP) levels of care are defined as follows: MP Level I: Emergent or Acutely Urgent Care Services are defined as threats to life, limb and senses. MP L evel II: Preventive Care Services are defined as primary health care that is aimed at the prevention of disease or disability. MP Level III: Specialty Services are considered ambulatory care which include inpatient and outpatient care services. MP Level IV: Chronic Tertiary and Extended Care Services are defined as requiring rehabilitation services, skilled nursing facility care. MP Level V: Excluded Services are services and procedures that are considered purely cosmetic in nature, i.e., plastic surgery . A PRC rate, a capitated rate based on Medicare payment methodology, is used to purchase care, and Medicare participating hospitals are required to accept this rate as payment in full for all hospital -based health care services (Public Law 108- 173). This allows IHS to purchase care at a lower cost than if each service were negotiated individually increasing access to quality health care services and provide care to better meet the health care needs of AI/ANs ( IHS Strategic Plan 1.3.4 - Increase access to quality community, direct, specialty, long- term care and support services, and referred health care services and identify barriers to care for AI/AN stakeholders and HHS Strategic Plan FY 2022 - 2026 Goal 1: Protect and Strengthen Equitable Access to High Quality and Affordable Healthcare ). Physician and non-hospital providers of supplies and servi ces are purchased at the PRC rate. However, if a physician or non -hospital provider does not accept the PRC capitated rate, agreements or contracts can be negotiated with individual providers of supplies or services using the provider's most favored customer rate as a ceiling for negotiation (42 CFR 136 Subpart I ) (IHS Strategic Plan 3.2.7 - Develop policies, use tools, and apply models that ensure efficient use of assets and resources and HHS Strategic Plan FY 2022 - 2026 Goal 5: Advance Strategic Management to Build Trust, Transparency, and Accountability ). Program funds are administered and managed at IHS Headquarters, at each of the 12 IHS Areas, and at IHS and Tribal facilities across the nation. The regulation has demonstrated that IHS is able to stretch the same amount of money to cover additional necessary health care services and improve access to care. This meets the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1: To ensure that comprehensive culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people. Objective 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services. HHS Strategic Plan FY 2022 - 2026 Goal 1: Protect and Strengthen Equitable Access to High Quality and Affordable Healthcar e. T he PRC Program also administers the Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund (CHEF). Created in 1988, 525 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621e, 1623; 42 CFR 136.61 (2010) CJ - 126th e CHEF was established for the sole purpose of meeting extraordinary medical costs associated with treatment of victims of disasters or catastrophic illnesses.6The CHEF is used to reimburse PRC programs for high cost cases (e.g., burn victims, motor vehicle crashes, high risk obstetrics, cardiology, etc.) after a threshold payment amount is met, the current threshold is $25,000. The CHEF is centrally managed at IHS Headquarters. The PRC Program contracts with a fiscal intermediary (FI), currently Blue Cross/Blue Shield of New Mexico, to ensure payments are made in accordance with IHS' payment policy, and coordinate benefits with other payers to maximize PRC resources. (IHS Strategic Plan 3.2.7 - Develop policies, use tools, and apply models that ensure efficient use of assets and resources and HHS Strategic Plan FY 2022 - 2026 Goal 5: Advance Strategic Management to Build Trust, Transparency, and Accountability ). All IHS-managed PRC programs and some tribally -managed PRC programs use the FI to ensure the use of PRC rates for inpatient services and PRC or negotiated rates for physician and non-hospital providers of supplies and services. PRC funding provides critical access to essential health care services and remains a top request by Tribes in the budget formulation recommendations. ( IHS Strategic Plan 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services and HHS Strategic Plan FY 2022 - 2026 Goal 1: Protect and Strengthen Equitable Access to High Quality and Affordable Healthcare). Note: On February 28, 2019, IHS updated the Indian Health Manual, Part 2, Services to Indians and Others, Chapter 3, Purchased/ Referred Care. In this IHM update IHS adopted the policy that PRC funds may be used for staff administrating the PRC program at administrative levels. This adopts the GAO recommendation for the use of PRC funds for PRC staff where appropriate. This poli cy change requires Areas to ensure they are funding requests through Priority Level II before these PRC administrative expenses can be charged. This policy meets the ( IHS Strategic Plan 1.1 Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforc e.) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Purchased/Referred Ca re (PRC) Rates - The PRC rates for all hospital -based services implemented in 2007 and the PRC rates for physicians and non- hospital providers of supplies and services implemented in 2016 have increased access to care by allowing I/T/Us to purchase additional services with these Medicare methodology capitated rates, referred to as PRC rates. PRC rates were originally referred to as Medicare- like rates (MLR) for hospital based services but are now identified as PRC rates. PRC rates are based on the Medicare payment methodology for all hospital based services, physician and non-hospital providers of supplies and services. The PRC rates rule (42 CFR 136 Subpart I) for physicians and non-hospital providers of supplies and services applies to tribally -operated PRC programs only to the extent the programs agree to \"opt-in\" via its Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act contract or compact. The rule has flexibility that allows PRC programs to negotiate rates that are higher than the PRC rate based on Medicare methodology , but equal to or less than the rates accepted by the provider or supplier's most f avored customer rate; in the absence of Medicare payment methodology for a service, the IHS payment amount is calculated at 65 percent of billed charges from the provider or supplier. Medical P riorities - Recent PRC program increase in purchasing power through the PRC rates described above have allowed most of the IHS and Tribally -managed PRC programs to approve referrals in priority categories other than Medical Priority I (life or limb), including some preventive care services, thus increasing access to patient care services. In FY 2021, 94 percent of IHS-operated PRC programs were able to purchase services beyond Medical Priority II - Preventive Care Services. Prior funding increases 625 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621a CJ - 127and Med icaid expansion have enabled programs to purchase preventive care beyond emergency care services, such as mammograms or colonoscopies. T he IHS PRC Workgroup helped IHS develop a more accurate form for annually reporting denied and deferred PRC services. In FY 2021, PRC programs denied and deferred an estimated $787,046,253 for an estimated 169,953 services for eligible AI/ANs. Because Tribally -managed programs are not required to report denials data, it is difficult to provide a verifiable and complete measure of the total unmet need for the entire I/T/U system. Therefore, the denied services estimate is based on actual data from federal programs and estimated Tribal data. Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund (CHEF) - In FY 2021 , all high cost cases submitted for reimbursement from the CHEF have been reimbursed. It is estimated that more cases may qualify for CHEF reimbursement but were not reported by local IHS and Tribally -managed PRC programs. Catastrophic case requests are reimbursed from the CHEF until funds are depleted. The implementation of PRC rates for inpatient and non-hospital providers of supplies and services as well as the increase of I/T/U beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid, Medicare and Private Insurance has enabled the CHEF to reimburse PRC programs for high cost catastrophic events and illnesses that occur through the end of the fiscal year. COVID-19 Th e COVID -19 pandemic has disproportionately affected American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations across the country. Data indicates AI/ANs have infection rates over 3.5 times higher than non-Hispanic whites, are over four times more likely to be hospitalized as a result of COVID -19, and have higher rates of mortality at younger ages than non -Hispanic whites. The IHS continues to work closely with our Tribal partners, Urban Indian Organizations, state, and local public health officials to coordinate a comprehensive public health response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. During FY 2020 and early FY 2021, the Indian health care system has modified health care delivery and adapted programming to address COVID-19. Since the beginning of the PHE through February 21, 2022, the PRC Fiscal Intermediary has processed 26,417 C OVID related claims in the amount of $49,443,129. This budget narrative may include examples of how care or programming was adapted to address COVID- 19. Please refer to the Overview of Agency Performance for additional information about the IHS COVID -19 Response . F UNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year T RIBAL SHARES Purchased and Referred Care funds are subject to tribal shares and are transferred to Tribes when they assume the responsibility for operating the associated programs, functions, services, and activities. The CHEF management is federally inherent and no part of CHEF or its administration can be subject to contract or grant under any law, including the Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act. CHEF fund cannot be allocated, apportioned, or delegated on an Area Office, Service Unit or other similar basis (25 U.S.C. 1621(a)(c)). CJ - 128 BUD GET REQUEST The FY 2023 budget submission for Purchased/Referred Care is $1.2 billion , which is $233 million above the FY 2022 Enacted level. FY 2022 Base Funding of $985 million will support over 40,000 inpatient admissions, over 942,000 outpatient visits, and over 45,000 patient travel trips. FY 2023 Funding Increases of $233 million includes : C urrent Services of +$26 million, including: o P ay Costs : +$291,000 - to fund pay increases for Federal and Tribal employees. o I nflation +$9 million to fund inflationary costs of providing health care services. o P opulation Growth +$17.4 million - to address the impact of the additional services need arising from the growing AI/AN population. The IHS projects a population growth rate of 1.8 percent in CY 2022 based on state births and deaths data. P urchased/Referred Care General Program Increase: +$184 m illion to address the unmet need for direct hea lth care services identified by the FY 2018 Indian Health Care Improvement Fund Work Group. These funds will support the following estimated increased services: o 7,333 Inpatient admissions o 182,319 Outpatient visits o 8,006 Patient travel trips A rizona State -wide PRC Delivery Area ($ 22 million) : The Indian Health Care Improvement Act directs the IHS to establish a state- wide Purchased/Referred Care Delivery Area (PRCDA) in Arizona to serve members of Indian tribes that reside in the state, so long as it does not curtail health services provided to Indians residing on reservations located in the state. Currently, there are many American Indians and Alaska Natives that reside within the state of Arizona, but are not members of Tribes with reservati ons located within the state (predominately members of the Navajo Nation). As a result, these individuals are not able to access PRC services in Arizona. o T his proposal would provide the funding necessary to create a state- wide PRCDA in Arizona without reducing the availability of services for members of Tribes that are located within the state. o The IHS previously conducted a feasibility study, which showed that there would be 67,434 newly eligible Tribal members under a state- wide PRCDA. The IHS multipl ies the average PRC spending per currently eligible Tribal member ($326) by the newly eligible Tribal members to develop the $22 million estimate. N orth Dakota/South Dakota PRC De livery Area Study (+$ 250,000) : These funds would support a feasibility study for a North Dakota/South Dakota PRCDA, much like the feasibility study that was conducted for the Arizona state -wide PRCDA. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act also directs the IHS to designate the states of North Dakota and South Dakota as a PRC Delivery Area, without CJ - 129i mpacting services for Indians residing on reservations either state. This funding would support a study to understand how many additional patients could be eligible under such a PRCDA to determine what funding may be necessary to create this new PRCDA without impacting services for Tribal members residing on reservations in either state. N ew Tribes (+$1 million): These fund will support the delivery of health care services for t he Buena Vista Rancheria of Me- Wuk Indians of California ($67,039 estimated funding requested). The tribe has been federally recognized since 1985 , but has not requested IHS funding until 2021. These resources would also support other newly federally recognized Tribes in FY 2023.

Direct Federal, P.L. 93-638 contracts and compacts, Tribal shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 authorizes the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund (IHCIF) for purposes of eliminating deficiencies in health status and resources of all Indian tribes, eliminating backlogs in health care services to Indians, meeting the health needs of Indians in an efficient and equitable manner, eliminating inequities in funding for both direct care and Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) programs, and augmenting health services where deficiencies are highest. The IHCIA specifies that the IHS take into account the actual cost of providing health care services given local geographic, climatic, rural, or other circumstances. The IHS received a total of $259 million in IHCIF resources from FY 2000 - FY 2018. Prio r to the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2018, which provided $72 million in a new IHCIF budget line, IHCIF increases were included in the Hospitals and Health Clinics budget line. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS A formula to allocate appropriations for the IHCIF was initially developed through the work of a Tribal/IHS Workgroup in 2000. The formula, which later became known as the Federal Disparity Index (FDI), or synonymously, the Level of Need Funded (LNF), measured the LNF for IHS and Tribal facilities relative to a benchmark level of funding. The formula was revisited once in 2010, prompted by the reauthorization of the IHCIA, which included an update to the IHCIF provision, expanding the list of services that the IHCIF may support, establishing a reporting requirement, and reaffirming that IHS must consider services and resources provided by Federal programs, private insurance, and programs of State and local governments. While technical improvements were made to the data used in the calculation, the IHS did not to ch ange the formula at that time. In late 2017, in recognition of the considerable changes in the health care environment since the 2010 Tribal consultation on the IHCIF, in response to Tribal requests, a nd the funding increase for the IHCIF in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, another IHCIF Tribal/IHS Workgroup (Workgroup) to the existing formula and make recommendations for improvement. CJ - 131The IHS updated the funding distribution formula based on the recommendations of the IHCIF workgroup, and allocated an additional $72 million in IHCIF resources to 40 sites across eight IHS Areas that were at or below a 34.84 percent Level of Need Funded. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount* 2019 $72,280,000 2020 $72,280,000 2021 /1 $0 1/ Resources in the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund are consolidated with historic funding amounts for this activity that were originally appropriated in Hospitals & Health Clinics. Fund for the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund is not eliminated. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2023 Request proposes to consolidate funding for the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund into its original appropriations location, Hos pitals and Health Clinics, through a budget- neutral realignment of the enacted base of $74 million. It also requests a General Program Increase of +$243 million within the Hospitals and Health Clinics funding line to provide additional direct health care services, and address resource disparities across the IHS.

Hepatitis B and Haemophilus Immunization Programs (Alaska) will support the provision of vaccines for preventable diseases, immunization consultation/ education, research, and liver disease treatment and management through direct patient care, surveillance, and education for Tribal facilities throughout A laska. The Immunization Alaska Program budget supports these priorities through direct patient care, surveillance, and educating Alaska Native patients. These Preventive Health services contribute widely to the performance measures that fall under the auspices of Hospitals & Health Clinics. PHN clinical services directly contribute to CJ - 133community health and wellness through immunizations, case management, and patient education. CHRs are also community -based and contribute to follow up care and lay health education. Health Education activities permeate the Indian health system and are integral to the fulfillment of the performance screening measures. The Immunization Alaska Program plays a key role by tracking immunization rates through specific immunization registries throughout the State of Alaska, and such efforts contribute to the national immunization rates.

Direct Federal, P.L. 93-638 Tribal Contracts and & Compacts, Tribal Shares, Grants PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Service ( IHS) Public Health Nursing (PHN) Program is a community health nursing program that focuses on the goals of promoting health and quality of life, and preventing disease and disability. The PHN Program provides quality, culturally sensitive health promotion and disease prevention nursing care services through primary, secondary and tertiary prevention services to individuals, families, and community groups: Primary prevention interventions aim to prevent disease and include such services as health education/behavioral counseling for health promotion, risk reduction, and immunizations. Secondary prevention interventions detect and treat problems in their early stages. Examples include health screening of high -risk populations, screening for diabetes and hypert ension, fall risk assessments, and school health assessments. Tertiary prevention interventions prevent or limit complications and disability in persons with an existing disease. The goal of tertiary prevention is to prevent the progression and complicatio ns associated with chronic and acute illness by providing optimal care for the patient. Examples include chronic disease case management, self -management education, medication management, and care coordination. The PHN program aligns with the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023 Goal 1 to ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN people by increasing access to quality health care services (Goal 1, objective 1.3). The PHN P rogram funds provide critical support for direct health care services in the community which improve Americans' access to health care and expand choices of care and service options. (Supports HHS Strategic Plan Goal 1:Protect and Strengthen Equitable Acce ss to High Quality and Affordabl e Health Care, Objective 1.3 Expand equitable access to comprehensive, community -based, innovative, and culturally- competent health care services while recognizing social determinants of health.) PHNs support population-focused services to promote healthier communities through community based direct nursing services, community development, and health promotion and di sease prevention activities. PHNs are licensed, professional nursing staff available to improve care transitions by providing patients with tools CJ - 135and support that promote knowledge and self-management of their condition as they transition from the hospital to home. The PHN expertise in communicable disease assessment, outreach, investigation, and, surveillance helps to manage and prevent the spread of communicable diseases. PHNs contribute to several agency's primary prevention efforts such as providing community immunization clinics , adm inistering immunizations to homebound AI/AN individuals, and through public health education, inspiring AI/AN people to engage in healthy lifestyles and ultimately live longer lives. PHNs conduct nurse home visiting services via referral for such activities as follows: Maternal and pediatric populations, including childhood obesity prevention through breastfeeding promotion, screening for early identification of developmental problems, and parenting education; Elder care services including safety and health maintenance care; Chronic disease care management; and Communicable disease investigation and treatment. PHNs perform a community assessment to identify high -risk populations and implement evidenced based interventions to address identified areas of need . This activity targets fragmentation in patient care services and improves care continuums, including patient safety . Interventions are monitored with data collection and evaluated for outcome with an emphasis on producing a good return on investments in terms of service(s) provided . PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS As part of the Agency's Public Health Response to the pandemic emergency, in FY 2021 the PHN Program supported efforts to end the pandemic through vaccine administration and measures to slow the spread of the virus. The degree of mitigation activity commensurrated with staff shortages that challenged efforts to administer vaccines as well as activities for ongoing case investigation and monitoring individuals for advers e events. The PHN Program stressed compliance with CDC guidance that was reflected in protocols which were communicated to staff and supervisors. For example, the enforcement of protocols to prioritize home visits and patient contacts to provide services to the greatest need by use of a PHN Program Priority, Intensity and Timeliness of follow up policy. PHNs implemented strategies to reduce transmission of the virus within AI/AN communities by providing patient education to promote behaviors that prevented spread and shared best practices as part of the IHS Vaccine Taskforce sponsored IHS -wide webinars. Existing best practices such as collaborating with a team that includes a designated point of contact for each tribe, the Primary Care Physicians and utilization of an established PHN patient referral system and tribal programs for assistance in monitoring patients was key in planning for vaccination administration. Hosting weekly calls with tribes to provide information and updates regarding plans for vaccination efforts, sharing of high risk elder list established prior to the COVID pandemic, and planning to replicate prior PHN activity to high risk elders with influenza vaccines were used to define administration plans of the COVID vaccine. Other establishe d PHN COVID vaccination efforts such as home visitation for home bound elders and drive through influenza vaccines continued. Prior to COVID, PHN's were already visiting elders and others in the home for safety and medication assessments. When influenza vaccines arrived PHN's began re-visiting known high risk elders and high risk patients with the help of the Community Health Representatives (CHR). The home visitations included providing up to date COVID information, safety COVID education, and COVID vaccination. During this time, the PHNs reported critical patient encounters for communicable disease, surveillance, contact tracing, testing, patient monitoring, and vaccination activities. These efforts resulted in an overall increase in the number of PHN activities reported to address the COVID-19 crisis. CJ - 136 During FY 2021, due to the pandemic crisis, PHN health promotion and disease prevention activities to improve the overall health prosperity of AI/AN communities resulted in decreased patient encounters for non- COV ID related follow up . The PHN Program aligns with the Agency's priorities and contributes to patient care coordination activities and access to quality, culturally competent care that aims to promote health and quality of life through a community population focused nurse visiting program which serves the patient and family in the home and in the community (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 1, Objective 1.3) . The PHN Program assesses the services provided in meeting the agency's priority Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) measures and integrates the Department's Strategic Goal to strengthen social well-being, equity, and economic resilience. (Supports HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2: Safeguard and Improve National and Global Health Conditions and Outcomes, Objective 2.3.Enhance promotion of healthy lifestyle choices to reduce occurrence and disparities in preventable injury, illness, and death.) Using a variety of methods to educate the AI/AN population such as individual and group patient educat ion sessions, screening activities and referring high -risk patients, and immunizing individuals to prevent illnesses, the PHN works to improve the overall wellness of Americans. Preventative health care informs populations, promotes healthy lifestyles and provides early treatment for illnesses. The PHN Data Mart report for FY 2021 reflects a decrease in PHN activity in GPRA screening documented activities which include the following encounter numbers : Tobacco Screening (2,811) Domestic Violence Screening (6,915) Depression Screening (6,071) Alcohol Screening (8,017) Adult Influenza Vaccines (36,324) In 2021, the PHN Program continued efforts to meet the IHS' s goal to decrease childhood obesity and prevent diabetes by supporting Baby Friendly re -designation by accomplishing the following activities: providing patient education, assessment and referral services for prenatal, postpartum and newborn clients during home visits , and utilizing a standardized PHN electronic health record template to document intervention (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 2 to promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization, Objective 2.2: provide care to better meet the health care needs of AI/AN communiti es; and, supports HHS S trategic Plan Goal 2:Objective 2.3) The PHN data mart provides a mechanism to evaluate how the PHN program delivers this evidence-based prevention service of promoting breastfeeding during the nurse patient encounter. For FY 2020, there were a total of 4,039 PHN patient encounters related to the Baby Friendly Hospital I nitiative . These patient encounters included 10,670 documented patient education topics provided by the PHN during prenatal, postpartum and newborn encounters, which included the following topics: breastfeeding, child health for the newborn, immunizations, family planning, sudden infant death syndrome, tobacco use/prevention, postpartum depression, formula feeding, and child health. As part of this initiative, I HS is encouraging clinicians in Indian Country to support policies and practices that foster breastfeeding as the exclusive feeding choice for infants during their first six months of life. By doing so, clinicians will reduce current and future medical problems and decrease health care costs. To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN people by increasing access to quality health care services (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 1; and, supports HHS Strategic Plan, Goal 3: Strengthen Social Well-Being, Equity, and Economic Resilience , Objective 3.3: Expand access to high- quality services and resources for older adults and their caregivers to support increased independence and quality of life) , the PHN Program continues to support caregivers of CJ - 137individuals suffering from dementia. Caregivers supported by the PHN program includes screening for depression, the effect of depression on daily life, and caregiver burden and frustration. For FY 2021, there have been 1,859 PHN encounters to patients with dementia , and services provided at these PHN encounters include the following: Immunizations (2,646) Medications (673) Communicable disease prevention (401) Life adaptation (427) Safety and fall prevention (126) In support of the Million Hearts campaign to prevent heart attacks and strokes, PHNs provided 13,438 patient encounters in FY2021 that encompassed patient education on tobacco cessation at 2,986, hypertension at 11,681, and sodium reduction at 727. Additional education provided during these PHN encounters include tobacco use, immunizations, diabetes, and medications. PHNs provide s ervices to enhance quality care and support patient safety during transitions of care settings by follow up on hospital discharges in an effort to decrease hospital readmissions. In FY 2021, PHNs documented patient encounters with patients who were discharged from the hospital and provided a total of 8,384 follow-up visits; some of these patients had multiple post discharge follow -up visits . Top patient education topics provided during these encounters include immunizations, community disease prevent ion, lifestyle adaptation and medication. As a means of improving quality care and meeting the needs of the AI/AN population ( supports IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 2, Objective 2.2) to ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to the AI/AN people and to support staff retention and staff development, an evidenced based preceptorship program with proven training materials, preceptor development, and repository of training material was initiated in 2020. In March 2020, the PHN Program hosted the Vermont Nurses in Partnership for a week long training in Albuquerque, New Mexico to establish evidence- based transition programs, competence validation, and experiential learning for the PHNs. In FY 2022-23 planning for ongoing training to support this activity will continue. In 2021, the PHN program continued interventions which targeted prevention of sexually transmitted infection (STI) to improve care. This activity can be monitored with the use of the PHN data mart tool as a performance measurement in support of practicing population based health management. The PHN data mart provides information on PHN activ ities such as the provision of patient education, surveillance and treatment of STIs. PHNs provided 30,098 patient encounters in FY2021 that encompassed 22,936 patient education codes documented for STI visits which included communicable disease, medicatio ns, contact with exposure, immunizations, and tobacco use. The PHN program will sponsor a grant program in FY2022 with a purpose to mitigate the prevalence of STIs within Indian Country. The emphasis is on raising awareness of STIs as a high -priority health issue among AI/AN communities and to support prevention and control activities of comorbid conditions. In FY 2017, the current PHN grant program awarded 9 grants with a performance period of 5 years; these awards have a narrow and defined area of focus, seeking to improve specific behavioral health outcomes and to support the efforts of AI/AN communities toward achieving excellence in holistic behavioral health treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention services for individuals and their families (IHS Str ategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 3, Objective 3.2). Currently, there are 7 grant programs with goals to improve behavioral health outcomes through a PHN case management model. In addition to reducing the cost of health care, case management CJ - 138has worth in terms of improving rehabilitation, improving quality of life, increasing client satisfaction and compliance by promoting client self- determination. The focus is on services for behavioral health and coexisting conditions such as chronic disease management, mat ernal child health care, and patient education services to improve health outcomes. The majority of the programs have established policies and procedures and nearly half are billing for PHN services to support sustainability. This grant program is ending in FY2022 and a new notice of funding opportunity will be awarded in 2023. The FY 2021 target for the PHN Program measure was 330,000 encounters. The final FY 2021 result of 428,476 patient encounters exceeded the target by 98,476 encounters, a 29 percent increase. The PHN impact during the COVID- 19 pandemic is reflected in the top ten patient encounters addressing communicable disease and surveillance. Historically, d ata exporting processes have impacted the overall PHN performance outcome as several tribal programs have migrated away from the IHS Patient Management System (RPMS) resulting in less visits being exported to the agency's National Data Warehouse database ; however, in FY 2021 the pandemic crisis impacted the PHN workload with testing, patient monitoring and vaccine administration activities. The end result has been an increase in the number of PHN activities being reported in regards to services provided to address the pandemic crisis. In FY 2022, use of the PHN data mart to reflect the PHN activity in meeting Agency goals and to supplement the PHN program's accomplishments report will be emphasized. These reports provide an avenue to monitor the PHN program's support of the health care delivery services in the community, and provides av ailable data to inform I/T/U decision -making (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 3, Objective 3.3 ; and, supports HHS Strategic Plan Draft, Goal 4, Restore Trust and Accelerate Advancements in Science and Research for All , Objective 4.4: Improve data collection, use, and evaluation, to increase evidence-based knowledge that leads to better health outcomes, reduced health disparities, and improved social well-being, equity, and economic resilience ). In FY 2021, the updates to the PHN Documentation Manual was not completed due to heavy workload in responding to the pandemic. This will be a goal for FY 2022-23 and include information on the PHN data mart reports to improve reporting of outcome. COVID-19 The COVID -19 pandemic has disproportionately affec ted American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations across the country. Data indicates AI/ANs have infection rates over 3.5 times higher than non- Hispanic whites, are over four times more likely to be hospitalized as a result of COVID -19, and have highe r rates of mortality at younger ages than non -Hispanic whites. The IHS continues to work closely with our Tribal partners, Urban Indian Organizations, state, and local public health officials to coordinate a comprehensive public health response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. During FY 2020 and early FY 2021, the Indian health care system has modified health care delivery and adapted programming to address COVID-19. This budget narrative may include examples of how care or programming was adapted to address COVID -19. Please refer to the Overview of Agency Performance for additional information about the IHS COVID- 19 Response.

The program focus es on the importance of educating patients in a manner that empo wers them to make positive choices in their lifestyles and how they utilize health services. Accreditation requirements at IHS and tribal facilities specifically require the provision and documentation of patient education as evidence of the delivery of quality care. In FY 2021, there was an increase of 16.15 percent or 462,205 patient visits from the previous year. In FY 2021, there was 2,917,182 patient education visit which exceeded FY 2020 patient education visits. The Health Education funds provide critical support for direct health care services focused on strengthening the collaborative partnerships among direct care pr oviders, patients, communities, and internal and external stakeholders. Funds are utilized to ensure IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian health care programs have comprehensive, culturally appropriate services, available and accessible personnel, promotes excellence and quality through implemented quality improvement strategies, and strengthens the IHS program management and operations to address health disparities an d raise the health status of AI/AN populations to the highest level possible (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019- 2023 , Goal 1, To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people; Goal 2, To promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization; & Goal 3, To strengthen IHS program management and operations ).

In FY 2021, the National Patient Education Committee continued to collaborate with the Office of Information Technology to update the RPMS/Electronic Health Record (EHR) coding, to streamline the patient education documentation process ( HHS Strategic Plan FY 2022- 2026, Goal 4, Restore Trust and Accelerate Advancements in Science and Research for All, Objective 4.4 Improve data collection, use, and evaluation, to increase evidence -based knowledge that leads to better health outcomes, reduced health disparities, and im proved social well -being, equity, and economic resilience ; & Goal 2, Safeguard and Improve National and Global Health Conditions and Outcomes, Objective 2.3 Enhance promotion of healthy behaviors to reduce occurrence and disparities in preventable injury, illness, and death). The Health Education Program maintains data tracking of key program objectives. Tracked data includes educational encounters, the number of patients who received patient education services, provider credentials of who delivered the patient education, site location where patient education was provided, health information provided, amou nt of time spent providing patient health education, patient understanding, and behavior goals. COVID-19 The COVID -19 pandemic has disproportionately affected AI/AN populations across the country. Data indicates AI/AN populations have infection rates over 3.5 times higher than non- Hispanic whites, are over four times more likely to be hospitalized as a result of COVID -19, and have higher rates of mortality at younger ages than non -Hispanic whites. The IHS continues to work closely with our Tribal partners, Urban Indian Organizations, state, and local public health officials to coordinate a comprehensive public health response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. During FY 2020 and FY 2021, the Indian health care system has modified health care delivery a nd adapted programming to address COVID-19.

The CHR Program was established by the Congress in 1968 in response to the expressed needs of American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/A N) governments, organizations, and the IHS, for a health care program which would provide an outreach component to meet specific tribal health care needs . The primary purpose of the CHR program is unique, distinct , and in line with broader Community Health Worker (C HW) workforce roles and competencies to include : (1) Relationship and trust -building - to identify specific needs of clients, (2) Communication - especially continuity and clarity, between provider and patient; and traditional knowledge and language, and (3) Focus on Social D eterminants of Health - conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, including social connectedness, traditional knowledge, spirituality, relationship to the environment , and a shared history. CHRs are trained in the skills of health care provision, disease control and prevention and help to eliminate health disparities by removing barrier s to care in their communities (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023 Goal 1, To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people, Objective 1.1 Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce ). CHRs are the frontline workforce focusing on improving Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) for underserved populations to decrease health inequities across the country using a community - based approach. CHR activities impact SDOH with access to care and coverage, social/cultural cohesion, transport ation, food access, environmental quality, social justice, housing and educational training opportunities ( Draft HHS Strategic Plan FY 2022 -2026 Goal 1, Protect and Strengthen Equitable Access to High Quality and Affordable Healthcare, Objective 1.3 Expand equitable access to comprehensive, community- based, innovative, and culturally -competent healthcare services while addressing social determinants of health ). CJ - 147 The CHR Program has made important contributions to Indian health in its efforts to provide community- oriented primary health care services serving as a way to bolster primary and preventive health (HHS Strategic Plan FY 2022-2026 Goal 1, Objective 1.5 Bolster the health workforce to insure delivery of quality services and care, and IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023 Goal 1, To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people , Objective 1.1 Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce ). CHRs are trusted members of the community and serve as a link between the Indian health system , including associated health programs, and AI/AN patients and communities. Importantly, this community- based delivery of care is provided in coordination with tribal health departments and programs. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS As CHR programs have transitioned from IHS direct care services to local community control via Tribal contracting and compacting, IHS's role has transitioned to providing support f or training CHRs and providing technical assistance to expand cohesion and greater understanding of the full potential of CHRs to improve health, support individual and community development, and access to systems of care. During FY 2021, t he Indian health care system modified health care delivery and adapted programming to address COVID-19. The CHR Program adapted accordingly to provide critical technical assistance and guidance for COVID- 19 infection control, prevention and health education outreach to communities. This budget narrative include s examples of how services and programming was adapted to address COVID-19.

COVID-19 The COVID -19 pandemic has disproportionately affected AI/AN populations across the country. Data indicates AI/AN populations have infection rates over 3.5 times higher than non- Hispanic whites, are over four times more likely to be hospitalized as a resul t of COVID -19, and have higher rates of mortality at younger ages than non -Hispanic whites. The IHS continues to work closely with our Tribal partners, Urban Indian Organizations, state, and local public health officials to coordinate a comprehensive public health response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. During FY 2021, the National Association of Community Health Workers (NACHW) authored the report Comm u nity Champions and COVID-19 Vaccination: Concerns, Challenges and Contributions of Community Health Workers, Contact Tracers and Community Ba sed Organizations during the First 60 Days of the COVID-19 Vaccine. This report provides a snapshot of respondent perspectives from individual, community, and system- levels, as well as challenges, bright spots and recommendations in vaccine distribution from 192 self-identified community health workers, contact tracers and community and organizational leaders. CHW respondents wrote about a variety of experiences with the COVID -19 vaccine, most of which fell into three categories: (1) I ndividual experiences with the vaccine and how they leveraged that experience in helping clients build confidence in getting vaccinated ; (2) Community level mistrust and misinformation surrounding the COVID- 19 vaccine and especially how social media has contributed to those barriers ; and (3) S ystemic barriers around vaccine access and lack of healthcare infrastructure which impeded on their community's ability to vaccinate their residents and adequately address the COVID-19 pandemic.

A portion of the overall Community Health Representative's budget line is reserved for inherently federal functions and is therefore retained by the IHS to perform the basic operational services of the Agency. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2023 budget submission for Community Health Representatives of $69 million is $5 million above the FY 2022 Enacted level. FY 2023 Funding Increase of $5 million includes: C urrent Services : +$3 million for current services including: o P ay Costs +$1 million - to fund pay increases for federal and Tribal employees, of whom approximately 90 percent are working at the service unit level providing health care and related services. o I nflation +$252,000 - to fund inflationary costs of providing health care serv ices. P opulation Growth +$1 million - to fund the additional service needs arising from the growing AI/AN population. The IHS projects a population growth rate of 1.8 percent in CY 2022 based on state births and deaths data. Pr o gram Evaluation : +$3 million for a national evaluation of the Community Health Representatives program. The Community Health Representative (CHR) program is over 90 percent directly operated b y Tribes or Tribal organizations. As a result, evidence of performance and outcomes is often anecdotal. Lack of national data demonstrating the impact of C HRs in the communities they serve, and the critical role they place to facilitate access to health care services for American Indians and Alaska Natives has raised questions from stakeholders about the overall efficacy of the program . The CHRs play an invaluable part in the Indian health system by providing culturally competent outreach and facilitation services to members of the communities they serve - usually their own Tribal members. The CHRs have proven to be a critical asset in AI/AN communities' response to COVID -19 by providing much needed long- term contact tracing, CJ - 152case management follow -ups, home visits, patient and community education on vaccine and public health measures, and transportation for tribal community members. The CHRs s erve as a vital link between the patient and the medical home by providing culturally appropriate care and supporting community health. The requested resources will support a national evaluation, and related activities, to enhance outcome measures and data informed training and policymaking for the C HR program. It will also help the IHS to articulate the critical role this program plays in ensure access to health care services for American Indians and Alaska Natives.

Self-Governance Compact , Tribal Shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Hepatitis B Program - T he Hepatitis B Program was initiated in 1983 because of the need to prevent and monitor hepatitis B infections among a large population of Alaska Natives with or susceptible to the disease. It continues to provide this service in addition to evaluation of vaccine effectiveness and the medical management of persons with hepatitis and liver disease. Haemophilus Immunization (Hib) Program - The Hib Program started in 1989 with a targeted Haemophilus Influenzae type b prevention project in the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta and now focuses on maintaining high vaccine coverage in a continued effort to prevent communicable disease by providing resources, training, and coordination to Tribal facilities throughout Alaska. Alaska's geography necessitates innovation in program delivery and use of technology as many Tribal facilities are located in remote areas off any continuous road system. The P rogram maintains immunization practice procedures in partnership with Alaska's statewide Community Health Aide Program to ensure Health Aides working in both urban and remote Tribal facilities have the resources needed to provide high quality vaccination services where Alaska Native families live and play (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Goal 1, Objective 1.3 Increase access to quality health care services; HHS Strategic Plan , Goal 1, Objective 1.3 Expand equitable access to comprehensive, community- based, innovat ive, and culturally-competent health care services while recognizing social determinants of health; HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2: Safeguard and Improve National and Global Health Conditions and Outcomes ). Through strong collaboration with local Tribal health partners and regional immunization coordinators, the State of Alaska Immunization Program and the IHS Area Immunization Program, the Hib Program offers clinical expertise in advancing vaccine reporting and data management capacity in an environment of evol ving and expanding electronic health record systems ( HHS Strategic Plan, Goal 4, Objective 4.4 Improve data collection, use, and evaluation to increase evidence-based knowledge that leads to better health outcomes, reduced health disparities, and improved social well-being, equity, and economic resilience ). In collaboration with statewide partners, the Hib Program advocates for continued access to affordable vaccine through public vaccine funding programs (HHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 : Protect and Strengthen Equitable Access to High Quality CJ - 154a nd Affordable Health Care ). The Program works with Tribal public relations to address parental immunization hesitancy and highlight the importance of vaccines, utilizing locally developed culturally appropriate marketing m aterials and social media campaigns. In alignment with the HHS Strategic Plan Goal 4: Restore Trust and Accelerate Advancements in Science and Research for All , the Hib Program continues to focus on optimizing available information technology to advance capacity in maintaining high vaccine coverage rates, through refining electronic health record processes and expanding capacity for training, social marketing and consultation throughout Alaska statewide. The Hepatitis B Program and the Hib Program of the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, in collaboration with Alaska Tribal Health Care System partners, provide s clinical expertise and consultation, trainings, research, evaluation and surveillance with the goal to reduce the occurrence of infectious disease and improve access to healthcare in the Alaska Native population. The programs support immunization, patient screening, development of electronic health record reminders and systems, providing an inf rastructure to maintain high vaccine coverage, and high clinical management coverage of hepatitis B and C in Alaska Natives. The program also manages patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), and nonalcoholic fatty NAFLD that have nonalcoholic steatoh epatitis (NASH) we have recently begun periodic screening and are included in these outcome measures. The Program promotes semi -annual screening of chronic hepatitis patients for both live r cancer and liver function (enzyme testing). The program s' activities support the IHS priorit ies on quality and partnerships as delineated in the IHS Strategic Plan . Working with partners within the Alaska Tribal Health System to meet the HHS Strategic Plan the program s provide both direct and telehealth patient care and health provider education to not only increase access to quality care, but also expand the options available (HHS Strategic Plan , Goal 4, Restore Trust and Accelerate Advancements in Science and Research for All, and the HHS Strategic Plan, Goal 1 Protect and Strengthen Equitable Access to High Quality and Affordable Health Care ). Both program s are actively engaged in preventing and treating communicable and chronic dis eases (HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2 Safeguard and Improve National and Global Health Conditions and Outcomes ). PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The Immunization Alaska P rogram comprised of both the Hepatitis B and Hib Programs has several performance measures to monitor progress in achieving the goal of high vaccine coverage for Alaska Native people as described below . Hepatitis B Program The Hepatitis B program continues to prevent and monitor hepatitis B infection among a large population of Alaska Natives with or susceptible to the disease. The program evaluates hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination coverage of Alaska Natives, and the total number of Alaska Native patients targeted for screening and the total number of patients screened for hepatitis B and hepatitis C as well as other causes of liver disease that disproportionately affect the Alaska Native population. Due to the opioi ds crisis, new hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections have increased 69 percent from 2015-2018 compared to the 2011-2014 time period. In response to this crisis, the Program is actively engaged in a statewide HCV elimination project. This involves recruiting patients for treatment through our local outpatient clinic, field clinics and video clinics (HHS Strategic Plan FY, Goal 2, Safeguard and Improve National and Global Health Conditions and Outcomes ) as well as performing provider in -person and webinar educa tion seminars on treating CJ - 155he patitis C to build. The Program website provides online treatment documents and a treatment algorithm for Alaska Tribal healthcare providers. Also, Program staff conduct monthly A laska HCV E xtension for Community H ealthcare O utcomes (ECHO) collaboratives providing remote assistance for hepatitis C case review and treatment recommendations. Since 2014 , over 1,035 American Indian/Alaska Native persons have been treated for HCV through the Alaska Tribal Health System (HHS Strateg ic Plan Goal 2 Safeguard and Improve National and Global Health Conditions and Outcomes ). The Program has two non- invasive elastography devices allows for the safe, non-invasive monitoring of liver disease progression without having to perform an invasive l iver biopsy. One is a portable machine that is transported to field clinics thus reducing the need for patients to travel to Anchorage or alternative site for their care (HHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 Protect and Strengthen Equitable Access to High Quality and Affordable Health Care) . With the onset of COVID -19 pandemic, the Program is monitoring persons with liver disease who test positive for COVID- 19 to track their health outcomes and assess any complications related to their liver disease. In FY 2021: Hepatitis A vaccination coverage did not achieve the t arget, and hepatitis B vaccination coverage exceeded the target. Hepatitis A vaccination coverage was 87 percent (90 percent target) and hepatitis B vaccination coverage was 9 5 percent (90 percent target). Overall, at least 73 percent of AI/ANs with either chronic hepatitis B (6 8 percent screened ) or hepatitis C ( 76 percent screened) infection were screened for liver cancer and for liver aminotransferase (enzyme) levels. Haemophilus Immunization (Hib) Program The Hib program continues to provide resources, training and coordination to Tribes in Alaska to maintain high vaccine coverage among Alaska Native people. Vaccine coverage data is collected for each Tribal region and measured in collaboration with regional Tribal health immunization coordinators (HHS Strategic Plan, Goal 4, Restore Trust and Accelerate Advancements in Science and Research for All ). Technical consultation for the varying electronic health record (EHR) systems within each Tribal health organization is provided to support improved vaccine coverage for all Tribes. Statewide Alaska Native vaccine coverage rates (including influenza) are reported to IHS National Immunization Program for infants 3 -27 months, 19-35 months, adolescents, adults. Flu vaccine coverage rates for healthcare personnel working at Tribal facilities are also reported to IHS National Immunization Program. Efforts p ursuing information technology to advance capacity in maintaining high va ccine coverage rates include: participation as clinical experts on national EHR advisory workgroups regarding immunization -related product development; local advocacy for advancements in Alaska Tribal health electronic health record systems, such as reminder recall systems (i.e. patient reminders) and vaccination service delivery options (i.e. satellite or off -site clinics); providing clinical expertise in the implementation of a clinical decision support system (i.e. vaccine forecaster) in a prominent Alaska Tribal Health electronic health record system; and collaborations with State and Tribal partners in expanding coverage reporting capacity in available electronic health record systems (HHS Strategic Plan Goal 5 : Advance Strategic Management to Build Tr ust, Transparency, and Accountability ). Improvement in vaccine coverage relies on data capture and quality in electronic health record systems, facilitated by data interfaces, and in conjunction with clinical resources and training. Routine immunizations have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Childhood immunization coverage with 4:3:1:3*:3:1:4 series for Alaska Native children age 19 -35 months CJ - 156de clined by 5 percent from March 31, 2020 (73 percent ) to June 30, 2021 (68 percent ). Leveraging the Health y People 2030 measures, the Program will add two immunization performance measures to the Program for Alaska Native children age 19 -35 months, 4 doses DTaP and 1 MMR. In respond to this dr op in non- COVID -19 vaccine coverage among Alaska Native children and in an effort to maintain routine vaccine coverage in all age groups, the Program is actively engaged in optimizing utilization of evidence- based strategies to improve vaccine coverage rates across the lifespan, in collabor ation with statewide partners and Tribal public relations. Activities will include technical assistance in optimizing available information technology capacity for efficient accessible childhood, adolescent and adult vaccine coverage reporting within the A laska Tribal Health Care system. During FY 2021: Immunization Coverage for Alaska Natives age 19-35 months was 68 percent, for the 4:3:1:3* :3:1:4 series (4 DTaP, 3 IPV, 1 MMR, 3 Hib, 3 Hep B, 1 Var, 4 PCV). o 4 DTaP in this age group was 72 percent , the Healthy People 2030 vaccination objective IID-06 to increase the coverage level of 4 doses of DTaP vaccine in children by age two years has a target of 90 percent . o 1 MMR in this age group was 88 percent , the Healthy People 2030 vaccination objective IID-03 to maintain the coverage level of 1 dose of MMR in children by age 2 years has a target of 90.8 percent. Achieved 88 percent coverage with full series Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) vaccine in children age 19- 35 months , which is much higher than the US all -races 2018 rate of 75.3 percent . In FY 2020, a chieved 60 percent Tdap vaccine coverage in all patients 19 years and older who had received Tdap within the past 10 years. Unable to measure in 2021. In FY 2020, a chieved 82 percent pneumococcal vaccine coverage in patients 65 years and older who received pneumococcal vaccine in the past ever. Unable to measure in 2021.

Challenges include the diversity of EHRs employed by T ribal organizations that may result in temporary loss or delay of Area-wide reporting of vaccine coverage. Regular r eporting of immunization coverage is critical in assuring sufficient monitoring and follow -up with facilities experiencing vaccination administration issues. Technical assistance to sites will continue to be addressed through coordinated efforts by the Hib P rogram, IHS , State, and T ribes . Vaccine coverage is measured. COVID-19 The COVID -19 pandemic has disproportionately affected American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations across the country. Data indicates AI/ANs have infection rates over 3.5 times higher than non- Hispanic whites, are over four times more likely to be ho spitalized as a result of COVID -19, and have higher rates of mortality at younger ages than non- Hispanic whites. The IHS continues to work closely with our Tribal partners, Urban Indian Organizations, state, and local public health officials to coordinate a comprehensive public health response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. During FY 2020 and early FY 2021, the Indian health care system has modified health care delivery and adapted programming to address COVID-19.

Permanent Allocation Method ...................... Formula Contracts and Competitive Formula Grants awarded to Urban Indian Organizations PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian H ealth S ervice (IHS) Office of Urban Indian Health Programs (O UIHP) was established in 1976 to make health care services more accessible to Urban American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) people. The IHS OUIHP 2017-2021 Strategic Plan guides, support s, and improve s access to high quality , culturally appropriate health c are services for Urban AI/AN people. The OUIHP Strategic Plan aligns with the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019- 2023 to support health care solutions that fit the diverse circumstances of Urban AI/AN people and the tribal communities they serve. Urban Indian Organization Leaders provided input through the Urban Confer process to help inform the development of the IHS Strategic Plan. The IHS Strategic Plan will guide the work of OUIHP as we continue to strengthen our partnership with Urban India n Organizations ( UIOs ) to address the three overarching goals of the IHS Strategic P lan to improve access to care, quality of care, and IHS management and operat ions. The IHS enters into limited, tive contracts and grants with 41 501(c)(3) non-pr ofit organizations to provide health care and referral services for U rban AI/AN people in 22 states and 11 IHS Areas . These IHS contracts and grants with UIOs address the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 , to ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN people . Awarding of these contracts and grants to UIOs also addresses HHS Strategic Plan Draft Goal 2, Safeguard and Improve National and Global Health Conditions and Outcomes . UIOs define their scope of work and services based upon the service population, health status, and unmet needs of the U rban AI/AN community they serve. Each Urban Indian Organization is governed by a Board of Directors that must include at least 51 percent Urban AI/ANs . UIOs provide unique access to quality health care and culturally appropriate services for Urban AI/AN people. The 41 UIOs are an integral part of the Indian health c are system and serve as resources to both tribal and Urban AI/AN communities , which addresses IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, to promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health s ystem into an optimally perform ing organization. Urban AI/AN people are often invisible in the urban setting and face unique challenges when accessing health care. A large proportion of Urban AI/AN CJ - 161people live in or near poverty and face multiple barriers such as the lack of quality and culturally relevant he alth care services in cities. UIOs are an important support to Urban AI/AN people seeking to maintain their tribal values and cultures and serve as a safety net for Urban AI/AN patients. Social determinants of health play a key role in health and wellness, and UIOs address a wide range of factors contribut ing to improved health outcomes. For example, Urban AI/AN people in need of substance use disorder treatment commonly exhibit co-occurring disorders, and UIOs integrat e behavioral health into primary ca re to offer health services within a culturally appropriate framework . UIOs provide health care services that address HHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Protecting and Strengthening Equitable Access to High Quality and Affordable Healthcare. In Calendar Year 2020 , UIO s provided 699,237 health care visits for 79,502 Urban AI/AN people who do not have access to the resources offered through IHS or tribally operated health care facilities because they do not live on or near a reservation1. UIOs vary in size and services - full ambulatory care, limited ambulatory care, outreach and referral, and residential and outpatient substance abuse treatment programs. UIOs are described as follows: o Full Ambulatory Care: Programs providing direct medical care to the population served for 40 or more hours per week. o Limited A m bulatory Care: Programs providing direct medical care to the population served for less than 40 hours per week. o Outreach and R e ferral : Programs provid ing case management of behavioral health counseling and education services, health promotion/disease prevention education, and immunization counseling but no t direct medical care services. o Residential and Outpatient S ubstance Abuse Treatment : Programs providing residential and outpatient substance abuse treatment, recovery, and prevention services. Included in the above 41 UIOs funded through contracts and grants , are the following : o O klahoma City Indian Clinic and Indian Health Care Resource Center of Tulsa: These two urban sites , initially demonstration projects , are now permanent programs within the IHS's direct care program and must continue to qualify as an Urban Indian Organization under the IHCIA definition , 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1660b. o Former National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Programs: As of FY 2020, the Urban Indian Health Program includes five UIOs that previously received grants originally awarded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (former- NIAAA program) and later administered by the IHS Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (ASAP). OUIHP confirmed each of these former -NIAAA programs is an Urban Indian Organization as defined by the IHCIA and fully implemented the administrative transfer from ASAP to OUIHP, as authorized by IHCIA at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1660c - Urban NIAAA transferred programs. Congress approved the transfer of this funding from the ASAP budget to the Urban Indian Health budget line for FY 2020. These Urban Indian Organization contract a ward s address IHS Goal 1, t o ensure that compre hensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people. These contract awards also align with HHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 , Protect and Strengthen Equitable Access to High Quality and Affordable Healthcare . The five UIOs provide high quality, culturally relevant prevention, early intervention, outpatient and residential substance abuse treatment services, and recovery support to meet the needs of Urban AI/AN communities they serve. 1 UDS Summary Report Final - 2020 (ihs.gov) CJ - 162The other major Urban Indian Health focus areas and activities are: o 4-in-1 Grant Program: In FY 2021, t he awarded 4 -in-1 grants to 33 UIOs. The grantees are awarded for a three-year funding cycle from April 1, 192019 - March 31, 2022. These grants provide funding to UIOs to support four health program areas: health promotion and disease prevention services; immunization services; alcohol and substance abuse related services; and mental health services. Grantees are required to participate in a national evaluation of the 4- in-1 grant program, which addresses IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2 , to promote excellence a nd quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization. The national evaluation includes reporting on the cultural interventions integrated into the 4- in-1 program activities, and practice based and evidence based approaches that are implemented to meet the needs of the Urban Indian service population. These grants protect and strengthen equitable access to high quality and affordable health care, which meets HHS Strategic Plan Draft Goal 1 and enhance promotion of healthy behaviors to reduce occurrence and disparities in preventable injury, illness, and death, which meets HHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.3. o Urban Indian Education and Research Organization Cooperative Agreement: P r ovides national education and research services for UIO s and OUIHP through a cooperative agreement. The cooperative agreement include s five project areas: (1) public policy; (2) research and data; (3) training and technical assistance; (4) education, public relations, a nd marketing; and (5) payment system reform/monitoring regulations. This cooperative agreement also addresses the unmet needs of 4 -in-1 grantees under two of the focus areas, including r esearch and data and training and t echnical assistance . This coopera tive agreement meets IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.2, to build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships. o A lbuquerque Indian Dental Clinic: P rovide s dental services through the Albuquerque Area IHS Dental Program. These services address the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, to ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN people. The provision of dental services also addresses HHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Protect and Strengthen Equitable Access to High Quality and Affordable Healthcare. UIOs are evaluated in accordance with the IHCIA requirements . The program is administered by OUIHP at IHS Headquarters. OUIHP integrates Enterprise Risk Management by annually reviewing Urban Indian O rganization progress with set goals and objectives. The IHS Urban Indian Organization On -Site Review Manual is used by the IHS Areas to conduct annual onsite reviews of IHS funded UIOs to monitor compliance with Federa l Acquisition Regulation contractual requirements established through legislation . The results are submitted to OUIHP for review and follow -up to ensure correctiv e action plans are successfully completed prior to continuation of funding. R equirements in the manual are based on best -practice standards for delivering safe and high quality health care and are similar to standards used by accrediting organizations. Many UIOs are seeking or maintaining accreditation from several accreditation organizations such as the Joint Commission, Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Healthcare (AAAHC) , and Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities. In F Y 2021, through an IHS contract with AAAHC, accreditation services were provided to 19 out of the 41 UIOs to meet IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.1, to create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization; and HHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Protect and Strengthen Equitable Access to High Quality and Affordable Healthcare . CJ - 163PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS UIOs fulfill IHS data reporting requirements including the IHS Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) report and the Diabetes Non -Clinical Audit report. UIO s currently participate in the IHS Improving Patient Care (IPC) I nitiative and are now in the Quality and Innovation Learning Network (QILN) implementing what they have learned across a wider variety of clinical and administrative options. From October 1, 2020, to September 30, 2021, the Urban Indian Organization FY 2021 GPRA cycle accomplishments included: 97 percent of the UIOs reported on 26 of the 26 performance measures (although not all have facility -specific data available due to inclusion in an IHS Service Unit) ; 59 percent of the UIOs reported through the Integrated Data Collection System Data Mart (IDCS DM); 13 (3 8 percent) have GPRA data specific to their health program available in IDCS DM; 7 UIOs reported through the Clinical Reporting System ( 2 of these programs reported both through IDCS DM and through CRS); and 13 UIOs reported manually using 100 percent review of appropriate data source (as opposed to sampling a smaller percentage of records). The IHS will proceed with plans to have all UIO s export data to the IHS National Data Warehouse (NDW ). This includes working with UIOs utilizing commercial off the shelf systems to export data to the NDW. The OUIHP will continue to work with the IHS National Patient Information Reporting System (NPIRS) staff to improve the export and accuracy of data for UIOs. The OUIHP , with the assistance of the IHS Office of Information Technology, will continue to provide training and technical assistance to UIOs on accurate and uniform data collection, so as to achieve stan dardization throughout the system. This work aligns with IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 2.1.1, to improve the transparency and the quality of data collected regarding health care services and program outcomes. It also aligns with HHS Strategic Plan Draft Goal 5 , Advance Strategic Management to Build Trust, Transparency, and Accountability . Design requirements for the IHS' s IDCS DM, include an aggregate Urban report to provide the clinical measure results reported in the Outputs and Outcomes Table of the Urban program's budget narrative. IDCS DM data is only available at the service unit level and IHS is unable to view individual urban program data for some sites sending in data. An aggregate Urban report requires data from individual facility rep orts to produce national results. IHS will report data from aggregate Urban reports when available. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Pub. L. No. 116-260) (hereinafter \"the Act\") was signed into law. The Act provided the IHS with a total FY 2021 appropriation of $6.4 billion. The Joint Explanatory Statement for Division G for the Act designated $1,000,000 to conduct an infrastructure study for facilities run by UIOs. The infrastructure study provides the first step towa rds creating a comprehensive action plan to focus on improving equity and reduce barriers to programs and services, which addresses IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, to ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are avai lable and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people. In FY 2021, the IHS initiated urban confer to seek input on developing and implementing the infrastructure study from UIOs. In FY 2022, the IHS awarded a contract to The Innova Group to conduct the infrastructure study to identify future facility needs of UIOs. The infrastructure comprehensive CJ - 164action plan will address HHS Strategic Draft Goal 1, Protect and Strengthen Equitable Access to High Quality and Affordable Healthcare. In FY 2021, the OUIHP leveraged the IHS Office of Public Health Support's Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to develop a new 5- year IHS OUIHP strategic plan. On December 3, 2021, the IHS initiated urban confer to seek input and recommendations on the new strategic plan to improve access to high quality, culturally competent health services for Urban Indians, which addresses IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, to promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization. In FY 2022, the expectation is to evaluate the existing OUIHP strategic plan and establish a new strategic plan, including goals, strategies, and performance measures based on recommendations from UIOs, partners, and external stakeholders. The new strategic plan addresses HHS Strategic Draft Goal 1, Protect and Strengthen Equitable Access to High Quality and Affordable Healthcare . FY 2020 - FY 2021 COVID -19 accomplishments include: IHS held monthly Urban Indian Organization Leader Calls. The purpose of these calls was to provide Urban Indian Organization Leaders with COVID-19 updates in: 1) Prevention, Detection, Treatment, and Recovery; 2) Funding; and 3) National Supply Service Center. In FY 2020, the OUIHP held 15 conference calls scheduled as weekly to biweekly then monthly. There was an estimated total of 1,195 participants. In FY 2021, the OUHP held 18 conference calls scheduled monthly. There was an estimated total of 588 participants. Comments receiv ed included COVID -19 funding, testing, vaccines, medical supplies, telehealth , and data collection. These calls ended on June 1, 2021. In FY 2020, IHS conducted three urban confer sessions on March 25, April 1, and April 29 to seek input on COVID-19 funding decisions for resource distributions to UIOs. There were a total of 551 participants (187 participants from March 25, 252 participants from April 1 , and 112 participants from April 29). In FY 2021, IHS conducted two urban confer session s on January 4 and March 15 to seek input regarding the allocation of COVID -19 resources. There were a total of 199 participants (130 participants from January 4 and 69 participants from March 15). The urban c onfer s atisfaction survey results indicated that participants were satisfied with information shared and topics discussed from sessions. On September 25, 2020, IHS initiated urban confer on COVID-19 vaccine pl anning. On October 8, 2020, IHS and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) held a listening session on COVID -19 vaccine planning and distribution. On October 14, 2020, IHS requested input on the IHS COVID -19 Pandemic Vaccine Draft Plan from Urban Indian Organization Leaders. IHS distributed funding in the amount of $478 million to UIOs from the Families Fir st Coronavirus Response Act; Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act; Paycheck Protection Program and Healthcare Enhancement Act ; Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act; and American Rescue Plan Act for response and recovery to COVID -19. In FY 2020, OUIHP approved Urban Emergency Funds totaling $200,000 to address costs incurred during the COVID-19 crisis. The Indian Health Center of Santa Clara Valley received $1 72,205, Oklahoma City Area received $18,645, American Indian Health Service of Chicago received $4,150, and $5,000 was used to procure personal protective equipment for 41 UIOs. In FY 2021, the American Indi an Health and Family Services in Detroit, Michigan , received $200,000 in Urban Emergency Funds. Across UIOs , more than 168,000 vaccine doses have been administered to patients, emplo yees, and urban community members, while more than 112,000 have been tested. CJ - 165 OUIHP coordinated two distributions of cloth masks totaling 78,500 to UIOs for critical infrastructure employees working in office settings to help slow the spread of COVID-19. Furthermore, OUIHP received approval to utilize IHS Headqua rters Managed COVID -19 funding for a cooperative agreement supplement ($1 million per year for 2 years) to provide Public Health Support through education and services to 41 UIOs during the pandemic. The supplement w as awarded on December 12, 2020, to the National Council of Urban Indian Health; and ends on June 14, 2022. COVID-19 The COVID -19 pandemic has disproportionately affected AI/AN populations across the country. Data indicates AI/ANs have infection rates over 3.5 times higher than non -Hispanic whites, are over four times more likely to be hospitalized as a result of COVID -19, and have higher rates of mortality at younger ages than non -Hispanic whites. The IHS continues to work closely with our Tribal partners, U IOs, state, and local public health officials to coordinate a comprehensive public health response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. During FY 2020 and FY 2021, the Indian health care system has modified health care delivery and adapted programming to address COVID-19.

Improving health care data , epidemiology, and population counts of AI/AN people residing in urban areas. Expanding access to quality, culturally competent care for Urban AI/AN people through collaboration with local, state, and other federal agencies. This funding increase could support an estimated 1,072,935 health care, outreach, and referral services to Urban Indian users in FY 2023. P artially Sustain ARPA Investments : +$9 million - to increase annual appropriations CJ - 167to sustain the ARPA public health workforce, mental health, and alcohol and substance abuse investments, preventing a significant reduction in services. The American Rescue Plan Act provided a historic investment in public health workforce activities, as well as mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services for American Indians and Alaska Natives. The IHS distributed th ese resources to all IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian Heath programs. However, the ARPA appropriation provided one-time, non-recurring funding to support mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services. Ongoing resources are necessary to ensure that IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian health programs do not have to significantly reduce public health workforce activities and mental health and substance abuse treatment services as the one- time ARPA resources are expended. R ealign Funding for Former National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) : +$31,061 - to realign remaining funding for former National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) programs from the Alcohol & Substance Abuse line into the Urban Health line (se e Difference column in the table below).

Authorizing Legislation ......................................................................... 25 U.S.C. 13, Snyder Act; 42 U.S.C. 2001, Transfer Act; Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA), as amended 2010 FY 2023 Authorization .................................................................................................... Permanent Allocation Method ................................................................. Direct Federal , Grants and Contracts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) Public. Law 94-437, as amended, authorizes the Indian Health Service (IHS) Scholarship program, Loan Repayment program (LRP), health professions training related grants, and recruitment and retention activities. The IHS made its first scholarship program awards in 1 978 when Congress appropriated funds for the Indian Health Professions (IHP) program. The IHP programs work synergistically and directly supports IHS' FY 2019 -2023 Strategic Plan, Goal 1, Objective 1.1 through the recruitment and retention of health care professionals to provide high- quality primary care and clinical preventive services to American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). The IHP programs also directly support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.2 through critical support in continuing to strengthen collaborations between the IHS, Tribes/Tribal organizations, Urban Indian organizations (I/T/U) and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to increase the number of sites eligible to participate as National Health Service Corps (NHSC) approved sites for the NHSC Scholarship program and LRP. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The IHP program has seen much success throughout the years including, but not limited to, the following: Recruiting well -qualified health care professionals thr ough various sources: IHS Scholarship Recipients, US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, U niformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) , various social media networking sites and through Career Fair events conducted virtually due to the pandemic. Conducting IHS Scholarship Program webinar- based general information session webinars for potential applicants. CJ - 171 Conducting Loan Repayment Program general information session webinar and invited unfunded incomplete LRP applicants, Indians Into Medicine, Indians Into Nursing, and Indians into Psychology Grant program students. Enhancement and update of the Career Opportunities webpages on the IHS.gov website. Enabling AI/ANs to enter health care professions through a carefully designed system o f preparatory, professional, and continuing educational assistance programs. Serving as a catalyst in developing AI/AN communities by providing educational opportunities for AI/ANs to become health care professionals and return to their local communities to provide health care. Developing and maintaining American Indian psychology career recruitment programs as a means of encouraging AI/ANs to enter the mental health field. Assisting AI/AN health programs to recruit and retain qualified health professiona ls. Collaborating with the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program that received an additional funding for loan repayment awards to clinicians working at IHS facilities, Tribally -operated 638 health programs, and Urban Indian programs to comba t the nation's opioid crisis. Established COVID -19 FAQs on IHS LRP Web site which informs recipients of the flexibilities to support program participants directly impacted by COVID -19. Consulting annually with IHS Area Directors, Tribal health directors, and Urban Indian health directors regarding their health professions priorities eligible for Scholarship and Loan Repayment Program funding. While the IHP programs have seen successes, IHP continues to strive to improve performance and identify areas of ri sk. Placement of new scholars within 90 days of completing their training continues to be a challenge. The use of outreach activities such as recruitment and placement webinars, direct emails to scholarship recipients , and the referral of graduates to area and site recruiters have all been used to facilitate the 90 day scholar placement . In FY 2019, 42 percent of scholars had a hire letter within 90 days (target was 78 percent). Failure to meet this g oal was primarily due to scholars not completing their licensing boards and finding positions within the 90 day period. The Scholarship program continues to seek new ways to assist IHS scholars to meet this requirement. Assuring scholars and loan repayment recipients meet their service obligation is another critical component of the IHP programs. Annual employment verification through personnel rosters and certification by Tribal employers assist in this process. Scholarship program and LRP databases allow staff to identify when health professionals are expected to complete their service obligation and allow for timely follow -up. Loan Repayment Program (Section 108): The LRP is an invaluable tool for recruiting and retaining healthcare professionals by offering them the opportunity to reduce their student loan debts through service to Indian health programs with critical staffing needs. Applicants agree to serve two years at an Indian health program in exchange for up to $20,000 per year in loan repayment funding and up to an addition al $5,000 per year to offset tax liability. Loan repayment recipients can extend their initial two -year contract on an annual basis until their original approved educational loan debt is paid. In FY 2021, a total of 1626 health professionals were receiving IHS loan repayment. This included 469 new two -year contracts, 642 one- year extension contracts and 515 health professionals starting the second year of their FY 2020 two-year contract. CJ - 172Applicants who apply for but do not receive funding , are identified as either \"matched unfunded\" or \"unmatched unfunded\" . The \"matched unfunded\" applicants are health professionals employed in an Indian health program. The \"unmatched unfunded\" applicants are health professionals that either decline a job offer because they did not receive loan repayment funding or those unable to find a suitable assignment meeting their personal or professional needs. In FY 2021, there were 38 \"matched unfunded\" applicants (including 10 nurses, 1 behavioral health providers, 3 dentists, 7 mid - level providers and 7 pharmacists, among others) and 314 \"unmatched unfunded\" health professionals (including 60 behavioral health providers, 10 dentists, 49 mid -level providers and 101 nurses among others). The inability to fund these 352 health professional applicants is a significant challenge for the recruitment efforts of the agency. A more detailed breakout of loan repayment awards in FY 2021 by discipline is included in a table at the end of the narrative. Scholarship Program (Sections 103 and 104) - Section 103 scholarships include the preparatory and pre-graduate scholarship programs that prepare students for health professions training programs. Graduate students and junior- and senior- level undergraduate students are given priority for funding for programs under Section 103, unless the section specifies otherwise. Section 104 includes the Health Professions Scholarship program, which provides financial support consisting of tuition, fees and a monthly stipend for AI/AN stude nts from federally recognized Tribes enrolled in health profession or allied health profession programs. Students accepting funding for programs under Section 104 incur a service obligation and payback requirement. In FY 2021, there were 618 new online scholarship applications submitted to the IHS Scholarship program. After evaluating the application for completeness and eligibility, a total of 134 of these new scholarship applications accepted the scholarship. The IHS Scholarship program also reviewed applications from previously awarded scholars that were continuing their education. A total of 121 extension awards were funded for FY 2021. A detailed breakout of scholarships awarded by discipline for FY 2021 is included in a table at the end of the narrative. Extern Program (Section 105) - Section 105 of the IHCIA, is designed to give IHS scholars and other health professions students the opportunity to gain clinical experience with IHS and Tribal health professionals in their chosen discipline. This program is open to IHS scholars and non- scholars. Students are employed up to 120 days annually, with most students working during the summer months. In summer 2021, the Extern Program funded a total of 14 student externs . The pandemic s ituation affected many facilities from hiring the student externs. A breakout of extern awards by Area Offices is included in a table at the end of the narrative.

FY 2022 Base Funding of $73 million - The base funding enables AI/ANs to enter the health care professions through a carefully designed system of preparatory, professional, and continuing CJ - 173educational assistance programs; serve as a catalyst in developing AI/AN communities by providing educational opportunities and enabling AI/AN health care professionals to further Indian self- determination in the delivery of health care; and assist Indian health programs to recruit and retain qualified health professionals. FY 2023 Funding Increase of +$21 million includes: Current Services of +$529,000, including: o Pay Costs: +$6,000 - to fund pay increases for Federal and Tribal employees. o Inflation : +$523,000 to fund inflationary costs of providing health care services. Indian Health Professions Increase : +$20 million to support a variety of activities to improve recruitment and retention, including compensation and hiring initiatives, bolstering the personnel security program, and streamlining human resources information systems. Examples of key activities supported by these funds are: o Additional Scholarship and Loan Repayment Awards (+$10 million) . These funds will support additional scholarship and loan repayment awards to improve recruitment and retention by bolstering two programs in high demand. o Compensation and Hiring Initiatives (+$1 million) . Activities include the review and development of Title 38 Special Salary Rates for allied health professionals, and system enhancements to implement work schedules for health care providers that a re currently available at VA and the private sector. o Personnel Security Program ( +$2 million) . This program is responsible for the proper vetting of incoming personnel, as well as continuous monitoring of personnel, to ensure eligibility to obtain and maintain a position of trust within the federal government. IHS' vetting process is also exte nded to support the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act - Public Law 101 -630, which is an additional check for all personnel occupying a position or performing work that involves regular contact with, or control over Indian children. The IHS personnel security program directly supports the recruitment and retention of IHS personnel. o Human Resources Information Systems ( +$2 million) . Funds will streamline recruitment and retention activities, such as automating compensation and onboarding activities to expedite the hiring process. o Housing Subsidies for Health Care Professionals (+$1 million) . The FY 2018 appropriation provided a new authority for the IHS to provide housing subsidies for health care professionals as a recruitment tool for IHS and Tribal Health Programs. The IHS did not receive funding to implement this new authority until the recruitment and retention funding increase in FY 2020. The IHS is in the process of implementing a pilot for this program to measure its success. Additional resources would make this a more CJ - 174robust pilot, with results that are more appropriate for generalizing across the Indian health system, while filling critical vacancies.

Permanent Allocation Method ............................... 93-638 Self- Determination Contracts, Self-Governance Compacts , and Tribal Shares PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Direct Operations budget supports the Indian Health Service (IHS) provi sion of Agency -wide leadership, oversight, and executive direction for the comprehensive public and personal health care provided to American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). Funds are used to promote the efficient and effective administ ration and oversight of national functions such as: human resources (HR) , financial management, acquisitions, internal control and risk management, health care and facilities planning, health information technology, Contract Disputes Act claims analysis, and other administrative support and systems accountability. These types of direct operations performed at the Headquarters and Area Office levels provide the foundation necessary to carry out the Agency m ission. The IHS Headquarters provides overall program direction, authorities, and oversight for the 12 IHS Areas and 170 Service Units; formulates policy and distributes resources; provides technical expertise to all components of the Indian health care system, which includes IHS direct, Tribally operated programs, and urban Indian organizations (I/T/U); maintains national statistics and public health surveillance; identifies trends; and projects future needs. The IHS Headquarters works in partnership with the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) and sister agencies to formulate and implement national health care priorities, goals, and objectives for AI/ANs within the framework of its mission. The IHS Headquarters also works with HHS to formulate the annual budget and necessary legislative proposals, respond to congressional inquiries, and collaborate with other governmental entities to enhance and support health care services for AI/ANs. By delegation from the IHS Director, the 12 Area Offices distribute resources, carry out policies and internal controls, monitor and evaluate the full range of comprehensive healthcare and community-oriented public health programs, and provide technical support to local Service Units and I/T/U staff. They ensure the delivery of quality health care through the 170 Service Units and participate in the development and demonstration of alternative means and improvement techniques of health services management and delivery to promote the optimal provision of health services to Indian people throughout the Indian health system. CJ - 183Direct Op erations funding supports all three goals of the IHS Strategic Plan. Recruitment, development, and retention of a dedicated, competent, and caring workforce (Goal 1, Access, Objective 1.1) is the foundation for improving quality (Goal 2) and strengthening management and operations (Goal 3). These funds are essential for sustaining a human resources program that can enhance and retain a workforce to carry out the agency's mission. The f unds also support quality improvement capabilities (Goal 2, Quality, O bjective 2.1) to ensure a quality healthcare program that promotes accountability, integrity, and stewardship. Woven through all of these components are the concerted efforts to continually strengthen IHS program management and operations through improved communication (Goal 3, Objective 3.1), secure and effective management of IHS's assets and resources (Goal 3, Objective 3.2), and modernization of information technology and systems to support data driven decisions (Goal 3, Objective 3.3). PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The Direct Operations budget is critical for continued progress in assuring an accountable, quality, and high- performing Indian health system . Examples of significant agency activities made possible by Direct Operations funds are provided below. The IHS is implementing activities to meet the strategies, objectives, and goals of the five-year (2019-2023) Strategic Plan which promotes a culture of accountability, quality, and patient safety across the agency , and serves as a roadmap for continual quality improvement . The Strategic Plan was published in February 2019 after extensive gathering of stakeholder input through Tribal Consultation , Urban Confer , and feedback from a IHS Federal- Tribal Strategic Planning Workgroup. To monitor implementation of the Strategic Plan, the IHS created a MS SharePoint site that allows for IHS Area and Headquarter (HQ) Offices reporting into a centralized location, the Strategic Plan Activity Repository (SPAR). Area and HQ Offices select high bar activities to include in the SPAR. These activities are updated quarterly (or more frequently as appropriate) and tied to a strategy. The IHS Strategic Plan has focused IHS programs and activities on improving quality, safety, and sustained compliance across the IHS healthcare system. As of December 20 21, 342 total activities from Areas and HQ offices are currently tied to the IHS Strategic Plan, all 12 Areas and 12 HQ offices contribute activities and updates. This activity meets the draft HHS Strategic Plan Goal 5, Advance Strategic Management to Build Trust, Transparency, and Accountability. The IHS is committed to improving the quality and safety of health care services. The Office of Quality (OQ), formally established in FY 2019, has made significant quality and patient safety improvements across the Agency . The OQ provide s the structure to promote accountability and oversight with a focus on quality assurance to promote and sustain compliance with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and accreditation organizations; quality improvement through innovation and implementation of quality improvement science; and improve patient safety and reduce all cause harm. Through the national leadership of the OQ in FY 2021, the IHS made substantial strides in addressing priority areas for quality improvement and patient safety including full implementation of the IHS Safety Tracking and Response system for tracking adverse events; coordinating infection control and prevention assessments in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC ); and hiring an Associate Director for Quality Assurance and Patient Safety . This activity meets the draft HHS Strategic Plan Goal 4, Strategic Objective 4.1 Improve the design, delive ry, and outcomes of HHS programs by prioritizing science, evidence, and inclusion . CJ - 184The IHS is committed to making improvements and ultimately to being removed from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) High Risk list. Although the IHS is still on the list, significant progress has been made. The GAO cited 14 open recommendations in the High Risk Reports. Of those 14 recommendations cited in the High Risk Reports, GAO closed 12 recommendations. In August 2020, the IHS requested GA O to close another recommendation regarding Quality Care. Like other rural healthcare providers, the IHS historically has difficulties recruiting and retaining healthcare providers. To address these challenges, IHS continues to maximize the use of avail able recruitment and retention tools such as recruitment, retention, and relocation incentives (3Rs) ; and use of Title 38 pay authorities. Most recently, t he IHS increased its competitive stance in the healthcare labor market through the authorization of new Title 38 Special Salary Rate pay tables for IHS nurses. Additionally, the Office of Personnel Management granted IHS the authority to approve up to a 50% 3Rs rate as needed to recruit and retain specific Chief Executive Officers overseeing health faci lities. To strengthen human resources management, the IHS issued a Special General Memorandum 21 - 02, Personnel Security and Suitability Determinations that establishes agency policy on addressing unfavorably background investigations. In FY 2022, the IHS will pil ot the USA Performance management system, which is an electronic performance management system developed by the Office of Personnel Management. This system will allow IHS to manage and track all performance plans in one system and will replace the paper p erformance plans. The use of an electronic system provides a streamlined and standardized performance management process. In FY 2023, USA Performance will roll-out IHS- wide. In FY 2019, the IHS continued to expand the use of data analysis and visualization tools to enhance reporting and data-driven decisions. Building on the successful completion of the IHS 3rd Party Revenue Dashboard \u2014a Qliksense based application developed to enhance reporting, trend analysis, and monitoring of third- party re sources (e.g. Medicare and Medicaid) collected by federally -operated facilities \u2014the IHS completed the \"Follow the Money\" Dashboard. This dashboard allows non- technical users to review funding status and spending data related to Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) instantly. Both applications democratize data previously held only in the proprietary accounting and reporting system s, Unified Financial Management System and Financial Business Intelligence System. Users are able to access data in a non -technical format that can be quickly sort ed and compare d by parameters such as type, Area, Service Unit, month, and fiscal year. This capability eliminates delays in access ing data through production financial systems, provides more financial information more widel y, and reduces the requirement for a skilled financial analyst to produce labor intensive report s on demand, thereby freeing valuable time for value added analysis. The IHS is committed to ensuring quality care for all patients and is actively working on deploying innovative strategies with a focus on achieving and sustaining improvements in quality of care, accountability and data -driven decision making, and recruiting and retaining a high performing workforce.

A portion of the overall Direct Operations budget line is reserved for inherently federal functions and is therefore retained by the IHS. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2023 budget submission for Direct Operations of $115 million is $ 20 million above the FY 2022 Enacted level. FY 2022 Base Funding of $95 million - Funding provides for the d irect operations of IHS's system -wide administrative, management, and oversight priorities at the discretion of the IHS Director that include: Continuing vital investments to enhance the IHS' s capacity for providing comprehensive oversight and accountability in key administrative areas such as: human resources, property, acquisition, financial management, information technology, and program and personnel performance management. Improving responsiveness to external authorities such as Congress, the GAO, and the Office of Inspector General (OIG); and addressing Congressional oversight and reports issued by the GAO and the OIG to make improvements in management of IHS programs, such as the PRC prog ram, quality oversight, and workforce. Addressing requirements for national initiatives associated with privacy requirements, facilities, and personnel security. Continuing analysis and settlement of tribal contracting and compacting Contract Support Costs (CSC) claims and maintaining policies and procedures to accurately determine CSC needs in the future. FY 2023 Funding Increase of $20 million includes : Current Services of +$3 million, including: o Pay Costs: +$ 3 million - to fund pay increases for Federal and Tribal employees. o Inflation +$156,000 to fund inflationary costs of providing health care services. Direct Operations: +$18 million in additional Direct Operations funding is essential for sustaining and bolstering core capacity to promote the efficient and effective administration and oversight of national functions like financial management, human resources, grants CJ - 186management, acquisitions, ISDEAA contracting and compacting administration, contract support costs and tribal lease payment admi nistration, performance management, and other administrative supports and systems. These resources would support critical hiring and systems needs at the national level, and within the IHS Area Offices. Current funding and staffing levels have led to delay s in reporting, contracting, grant making, and hiring, and may lead to increased program risk. Increasing resources for these core management functions is vital for shoring up foundational capacity to support the IHS mission. Additional staff and resources are needed to maintain national and Area- level focus on fiscally responsible, accountable, and effective administration over inherently federal functions such as budget formulation and execution, policy management, workforce management and personnel secur ity, acquisitions and grants management, Government Performance and Results Act and related performance management, and other key functions. The IHS also faces increasing responsibilities associated with expansion of Indian Self- determination, through which Tribal Health Programs operate over 60 percent of the IHS's appropriated resources. The IHS must have the necessary resources to provide technical assistance to Tribes and Tribal Organizations, and effectively manage ISDEAA contracts and compacts. In vestments in these critical programs can mitigate the potential for missed deadlines with potentially large and recurring financial penalties, facilitate consistency in ISDEAA contract and compact terms to reduce legal risk, and ensure well prepared and accurate reporting and negotiations. Similarly, the IHS is responsible for providing appropriate oversight and ensuring program integrity for Contract Support Costs and section 105(l) lease agreements, whose costs continue to increase over time. In addition, these funds would also support a National Compliance Program. In January 2020, the IHS initiated the development of a national compliance program to address recommendations made by the HHS Office of Inspector General (https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-06-16-00390.asp. In 2010, the Office of Inspector General established a framework for compliance programs for health care providers. Seven key components of that framework guide the IHS national compliance program activities: designated compliance professionals, written policies and procedures, effective communication, effective training, enforcement of standards, internal auditing and monitoring, and prompt, responsive corrective action plans. The request would support: o Compliance Oversight Reviews: Process development for annual Area- level reviews, and provide supports to Area Offices to resolve findings. o High Risk Administrative Investigations : Acquire contracting support to perfor m internal investigations of high risk issues, and remediate findings. o Enterprise Risk Management and OMB A -123 Activities : Implement a robust enterprise risk management plan for the Agency, and customize OMB A -123 audit activities for IHS needs. o Additional FTE: Support inherently federal functions related to compliance and management of new activities.

Direct Federal, Cooperative Agreements, and Self -Governance Funding Agreements PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Office of Tribal Self-Governance (OTSG) is responsible for a wide range of A gency functions that are critical to the IHS's efforts to expand equitable access to comprehensive, community-based, innovative, and culturally -competent healthcare services while addressing social determinants of health ps HHS Strategic Plan FY 2022-2026, Goal 1, Objective 1.3) while sustaining collaborative relationships with American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) nations, T ribal organizations, and other AI/AN groups . The OTSG serves as the primary liaison and advocate for Tribes and Tribal organization participating in the Tribal Self - Governance Program (TSGP) as authorized under Title V of the Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) (25 U.S.C. \u00a75381 et. seq.) Through the TSGP, Tri bes have the option to assume IHS program funds and manage them to best fit the needs of their Tribal communities. Tribes participating in the TSGP negotiate with the IHS and take on full funding, control, and accountability for those programs, services, functions, and activities (PSFAs), or portions thereof, that the Tribe chooses to assume. The Self -Governance budget supports several OTSG activities and functions : Develops and oversees the implementation of Tribal self-governance legislation and authorities in the IHS that expand equitable access to comprehensive, community -based, innovative, and culturally -competent healthcare services while addressing social determinants of health ( HHS Strategic Plan FY 2022- 2026, Goal 1, Objective 1.3 ) that im prove quality of healthcare services (Strategic Goal 1, Objective 1.2 ) and increase choice, affordability, and enrollment in high- quality healthcare coverage (Strategic Goal 1, Objective 1.1).

P ROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The IHS TSGP has grown dramatically since the execution of the initial 14 compacts and funding agreements in 1994. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2020, IH S transferred approximately $2.6 billion o f the total IHS budget appropriation to Tribes and Tribal organizations to support 105 ISDEAA self - governance compacts and 131 funding agreements.1 1 For FY 20 21, the IHS estimates an additional five Tribes will be entering into Title V ISDEAA compacts and funding agreements. This estimate corresponds to the number of Self -Governance Negotiation Cooperative Agreements available each fiscal year. CJ - 190The Self-Governance budget brings health care quality expertise to the IHS, and Tribes, by: Providing support for projects that assist Tribally operated health programs that build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019- 2023, Goal 1, Objective 1.2 ); improve the communication with Tribes (Strategic Goal 3, Objective 3.1) and provide care to better meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native Communities (Strategic Goal 2, Objective 2.2) . For example, the IHS collaborated with Tribes and Tribal Organizations to coordinate the Virtual F iscal Year 2021 Annual Self- Governance Tribal Conference which brings together Self -Governance Tribes, the Department of Interior, and other federal agencies to discuss key topics with Self -Governance Tribes to share and learn best practices, and to promote the participation of all American Indian and Alaska Native Tribes in IHS Tribal Self -Gover nance activities. In FY 2021-2022, t he IHS also awarded four (4) Tribal Self -Governance Planning and Negotiation Cooperative Agreements to Tribes, which support Tribes and Tribal organizations with the planning and preparation necessary to assume responsi bility for providing health care to their tribal members through the IHS TSGP . Collaborating on crosscutting issues and processes including, but not limited to: program management issues; self-determination issues; Tribal shares methodologies; and emergency preparedness, response and security to secure and effectively manage the assets and resources (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 - 2023, Goal 3, Objective 3.2); improve communication with Tribes, Urban Programs, and other stakeholders, and modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decisions (Strategic Goal 3, Objective 3.1 and 3.3). In FY 2021-2022, the IHS coordinated with Tribes and Tribal Organizations three (3) virtual Tribal Self -Governance Advisory Committee and Joint Tribal -Federal Technical Workgroup meetings. This Committee advocates for Self -Governance Tribes and Tribal Organizations , suggests policy guidance on the implementation of the TSGP, and advises the IHS Director on issues of concern to all Self -Governance Tribes. Additionally, in FY 2021-2022, the IHS implemented Tribal Consultation, and reinstituted a Tribal Consultation Policy Workgroup of Tribal and Federal leaders, to update the IHS Tribal Consultation Policy and establish it as permanent policy in the Indian Health Manual . Providing technical assistance, disseminating communication, and support ing the disbursement of funds related to Coronavirus (COVID-19) activities to Self-Governance Tribes to build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019- 2023, Goal 1, Objective 1.2) . In 2021-2022, the IHS distributed five (5) COVID- related supplements to Self - Governance Tribes and Tribal Organizations. These services are deployed in accordance with strategic planning, are data driven, and support program integrity that create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Goal 2, Objective 2.1) through adherence to reporting requirements . The O ffice of Tribal S elf-Governance Funds Management Database supports the Eligibility requirements for these agreements mirror the statutory requirements that Tribes must meet to participate in the IHS Tribal Self-Governance Program (25 U.S.C. \u00a75383; 42 C.F.R. Part 137, Subpart C). For this pool, an average estimate of $5 million per Tribe is used to project estimates for Tribes en tering into a Title V ISDEAA compacts and funding agreements, inclusive of both Tribal shares and Contract Support Costs.

Grants and Contracts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI) grant program provides funding for diabetes treatment and prevention t o approximately 301 Indian Health Service (IHS) , Tribal , and Urban (I/T/U) Indian health grant programs. Funds for SDPI were first authorized in FY 1998; as such, FY 2023 would be the 26 th year of the SDPI . SDPI is currently authorized through September 30, 2023. The IHS Office of Clinical and Preventive Services (OCPS) Division of Diabetes Treatment and Prevention (DDTP) provides leadership, programmatic, administrative, and technical oversight to the SDPI grant program. CJ - 194The mission of the DDTP is to develop, document, and sustain public health efforts to prevent and control diabetes in American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) by promoting collaborative strategies through its extensive diabetes network . This mission aligns with Goal 1 of the IHS Strategic Plan , To ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people and Objective 2.2 of the HHS Strategic Plan , Provide care to better meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities . The diabetes network consists of a national program office, Area Diabetes Consultants in each of the 12 IHS Areas, and approximately 301 S DPI grants and sub -grants at I/T/U sites across the country . Target Population: American Indians and Alaska Natives Diabetes and its complications are major contributors to death and disability in nearly every Tribal community. AI/AN adults have the highest age- adjusted rate of diagnosed diabetes (14.5 percent) among all racial and ethnic groups in the United States, more than twice the rate of the non-Hispanic white population (7.4 percent).1 In some AI/AN communities, more than half of adults 45 to 74 years of age have diagnosed diabetes, with preval ence rates reaching as high as 60 percent.2 Allocation Method In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress instructed the IHS to use SDPI funds to \"establish grants for the prevention and treatment of diabetes\" to address the growing problem of diabete s among AI/AN people . The entities eligible to receive these grants were I/T/Us . The IHS distributes this funding to approximately 301 I/T/U sites annually through a process that includes Tribal C onsultation /Urban Confer, development of a formula for distribution of funds, and a formal grant application and administrative process. This process is consistent with IHS Strategic Plan Objective 1.2 to \"build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships \" and also supports Objective 5.1 of the HHS Strategic Plan to ensure responsible financial management. Strategy The SDPI brings Tribes together to work toward a common purpose and share information and lessons learned. The Tribal Leaders Diabetes Committee, established in 1998, reviews information on the SDPI progress and provides recommendations on diabetes- related issues to the IHS Director. Through partnerships with federal agencies, private organizations, and an extensive I/T/U network, DDTP undertook o ne of the most strategic diabetes treatment and prevention efforts ever attempted in AI/AN communities and demonstrated the ability to design, manage, and measure a complex, long -term project to address this chronic condition. Because of the significant c osts associated with treating diabetes, I/T/Us have used best and promising practices for their local SDPI funding to address the primary, secondary , and tertiary prevention of diabetes and its complications. These efforts increase the availability and ac cessibility of 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

This collaborative approach supports the strategic planning process necessary to identify the goals and objectives needed to achieve the intended SDPI outcomes. As in Objectives 1.2, 1.3, and 3.1 of the IHS Strategic Plan, the SDPI promotes collaboration and communication with Tribes and Urban Indian Organizat ions in the development of quality community- based diabetes prevention and treatment programs. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS SDPI: T wo Major Components As directed by Congress and Tribal consultation, the SDPI consists of t wo major components: (1) SDPI Grant Program; and (2) Diabetes data and program delivery infrastructure. 1. S DPI Grant Program The SDPI grant program (formerly called the SDPI Community -Directed grant program) provides $138.7 million per year in grants and technical assistance for loca l diabetes treatment and prevention services at I/T/U health programs in 35 states. Each of the communities served by the SDPI grant program is unique in that its diabetes treatment and prevention needs and priorities are defined locally. Based on these local needs and priorities, the SDPI grant programs implement interventions to address the diabetes epidemic. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 established statutory authority for SDPI to implement a best practices approach to diabetes treatment and prevention. As such, t he SDPI has incorporated Indian Health Diabetes Best Practices into the SDPI g rant application process used throughout AI/AN communities. This effort is used to promote excellence and quality within the SDPI programs, which aligns with the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2. Grant programs are required to document the use of one SDPI Diabetes Best Practice, 3 corresponding evaluation measures, and progress in achieving program objectives in order to enhance accountability. Grantees receive training on how to collect, evaluate, and improve their data collection and use it to improve their outcome results. Impact of the SDPI Grant Programs SDPI funding has enabled staff and programs at the local and national levels to increase access to diabetes treatment and prevention services throughout the Indian health system. The following table demonstrates substantial increases in access to many activities and services: 3 Available at https://www.ihs.gov/sdpi/sdpi- community -directed/diabetes -best-practices/ CJ - 196 Diabetes treatment and prevention services available to AI/AN individual s Access in 1997 Access in 2019 Absolute Percentage increase Diabetes clinical teams 30% 95% +65% Diabetes patient registered dieticians diabetes education materials Access to physical activity specialists Adult weight management services 19% 76% +57% Clinical Diabetes Outcomes during SDPI At the same time that access to these diabetes services increased, key outcome measures for AI/ANs with diabetes showed improvement or maintenance at or near national targets. These results have been sustained throughout the inception of SDPI. Examples include: Improving Blood Sugar Control Blood sugar control among AI/ANs with diabetes served by the IHS has improved over time. The average blood sugar level (as measured by the A1C test) decreased from 9.0 percent in 1996 to 8.2 percent in 2021, nearing the A1C goal for most patients of less than 8 percent. Improving Blood Lipid Levels Average LDL cholesterol (i.e., \"bad\" cholesterol) declined from 118 mg/dL in 1998 to 88 mg/dL in 2021, surpassing the goal of less than 100 mg/dL. Reducing Kidney F ailure The rate of new cases of kidney failure due to diabetes leading to dialysis declined by more than half (54 percent ) in AI/AN people from 1996 to 2013. This is a much larger decline than in any other racial group in the US. 4 2. D iabetes Data and Program Delivery Infrastructure The IHS has used funding from the SDPI to strengthen the diabetes data infrastructure of the Indian health system by improving diabetes surveillance and evaluation capabilities. The SDPI supports the development and implementation of the IHS Electronic Health Record, and the IH S Diabetes Management System in all 12 IHS Areas, which supports Objective 3.3 of the IHS Strategic Plan . Facilities associated with SDPI programs participate in the annual IHS Diabetes Care and Outcomes Audit. The Diabetes Audit is the cornerstone of the IHS DDTP diabetes care surveillance system, tracking annual performance on diabetes care and health outcome measures. Data collection for the Diabetes Audit follows a standardized protocol to ensure statistical integrity and comparability of measures o ver time. The 20 21 Diabetes Audit included a review of 126,550 patient charts at 3 23 I/T/U health facilities. The Diabetes Audit enables IHS and the SDPI programs to monitor and evaluate yearly performance at the local, regional, and national 4 Bullock A, Burrows NR, Narva AS, et al. Vital Signs: Decrease in Incidence of Diabetes -Related End -Stage Renal Disease among American Indians/Alaska Natives \u2014 United States, well as enhance quality improvement capabilities across AI/AN communities. These innovative efforts align with Objective 2.1 of the IHS Strategic Plan. DDTP provides D iabetes Audit training through online and webinar formats. DDTP receives evaluations on all trainings provided to guide improvements for future sessions. Key Performance/Accomplishments Annual SDPI assessments have shown significant improvements in the availability of diabetes clinical care and community services provided over time when compared to the baseline SDPI assessment in 1997 (see table above titled \"Diabetes treatment and prevention services available to AI/AN individuals\"). Ongoing efforts to improve blood glucose, blood pressure , and cholesterol values will continue to reduce the risk for microvascular, as well as macrovascular complications (see \"Outputs/Outcomes \" table below). Reporting In addition to internal monitoring of the SDPI Grant Program, the DDTP has completed six SDPI Reports to Congress to document the progress made since 1997. The SDPI Reports to Congress are as follows: January 2000 Interim Report to Congress on SDPI; December 2004 Interim Report to Congress on SDPI; 2007 SD PI Report to Congress: On the Path To A Healthier Future ; 2011 SDPI Report to Congress: Making Progress Toward A Healthier Future ; 2014 SDPI Report to Congress : Changing the Course of Diabetes: Turning Hope into Reality ; and 2020 SDPI Report to Congress: Changing the Course of Dia betes: Charting Remarkable Progress.

Direct Federal, P.L. 93-638 Self-Determination Contracts and Self- Governance Compacts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Maintenance and Improvement (M&I) funds are the primary source of funding to maintain, repair, and improve existing Indian Health Service (IHS) and Tribal health care facilities, which are used to deliver and support health care services. M&I funding suppo rts federal, government owned buildings and tribally- owned space where health care services are provided pursuant to contracts or compacts executed under the provisions of the Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act (P.L. 93 -638). M&I funds are necessary to achieve and maintain accreditation, to meet building codes and standards, to maintain and repair the physical condition of health care facilities, to modernize existing health care facilities to meet changing health care delivery needs, an d to implement mandated requirements (e.g., energy conservation, seismic, environmental, handicapped accessibility, security, etc.). Efficient and effective buildings and infrastructure are vital to delivering health care in direct support of the IHS mission and priorities. Maintaining reliable and efficient buildings is an increasing challenge as existing health care facilities age and additional space is added into the real property inventory. The average age for IHS-owned health care facilities is approximately 35 years, whereas the average age, including recapitalization of private- sector hospital plants, is 9 to 10 years. 1 Many IHS and Tribal health care facilities are operating at or beyond capacity, and their designs are not efficient in the contex t of modern health care delivery. In addition, as existing health care facilities continue to age, the operational and maintenance costs increase. ( The 'average age of hospital plant' measures the average age of the facility including capital improvements, replacement of built-in equipment and modernization.) 1 Committing to the Cost of Ownership - Maintenance and Repair of Public Buildings, The National Academies Press (1990), available at http://www.nap.edu/catalog CJ - 204IHS hospital administrators have reported that old or inadequate physical environments challenged their ability to provide quality care and maintain compliance with the Medicare Hospital Conditions of Participation. Further, the administrators reported that maintaining aging buildings and equipment is a major challenge. Over one third of all IHS hospital deficiencies have been found to be related to facilities with some failing on infection control criteria and others having malfunctioning exit doors. The physical condition of IHS-owned and many tribally owned healthcare facilities is evaluated through routine observations by facilities personnel and by in-depth condition surveys. These observations and surveys identify facility, fire- life-safety, and program deficiencies, and are used to develop IHS' estimate of the Backlog of Essential Maintenance, Alteration, and Repair (BEMAR). The BEMAR is a measure of the condition of health care facilities in the Indian health system and establishes priorities for larger M&I projects. The FY 2021 BEMAR for all IHS and reporting Tribal health care facilities as of October 1, 2021, is $1,022 million. When IHS replaces an older, obsolete hospital or clinic with a new facility, all deficiencies associated with the old facility are removed from the backlog M&I Funds Allocation Method The IHS M&I funds are allocated in four categories: routine maintenance, M&I projects, environmental compliance, and demolition: 1. Routine Maintenance Funds - These funds support activities that are generally classified as those needed for maintenance and minor repair to keep the health care facility in its current condition. Funding allocation is formula based. The Building Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences has determined that approximately two to four percent of current replacement value of supported buildings is required to maintain (i.e., 'sustain') facilities in their current condition. 2 2. M&I Project Funds - These funds are used for major projects to reduce the Backlog of Essential Maintenance, Alteration and Repair ( BEMAR ) and make improvements necessary to support health care delivery. This funding will p rovid e improvements to facilities for enhanced patient a ccess and care and facilitate larger M&I projects to reduce the (BEMAR) within a five year period. Funding allocation is formula based. 3. Environmental Compliance Funds - These funds are used to address findings and recommendations from environmental audits, to improve energy efficiency and water efficiency, to increase renewable energy usage, to reduce consumption of fossil -fuel generated electricity, and to implement other sustainability initiatives. These funds are available to Federal and Tribal health care facilities on a national basis. 4. Demolition Funds - The IHS has a number of Federally owned buildings that are vacant, excess, or obsolete. Demolition funds are used to dispose of these excess assets. These funds may be augmented with Environmental Compliance Funds as available for demolition and disposal to the extent that the proposed action reduces hazards, environmental concerns, or liability to IHS. Based upon recent interpretation of the Administrative Provision related to Demolition of hazardous, obsolete federal buildings, the inventory of this federal inventory continues to grow as does the potential liability. 2 Committing to the Cost of Ownership - Maintenance and Repair of Public Buildings, The National Academies Press (1990), available at http://www.nap.edu/catalog . CJ - 205 IHS Strategic Plan and how the Facili ties programs are implementing : In consultation with Tribes and the Federal healthcare sites, IHS is allocating funding to the IHS Area Offices to complete BEMAR projects t o make renovations and improvements necessary to support health care delivery in the health care facilities and to modernize the health care facilities and staff quarters to expand access to quality health care services. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount 2019 $167,527 ,000 2020 $168,952 ,000 2021 Final $168,952 ,000 2022 Enacted $169,664 ,000 2023 President's Budget $345,565,000 TRIBAL SHARES There are no Tribal Shares allocated fro m Maintenance & Improvement funds. Rather, Tribal shares associated with the Facilities Program may be transferred to Tribes when they assume the responsibility for operating the associated programs, functions, services, and activities at a Federal or Tribal healthcare site. Tribes may also contract or compact to perform individual Maintenance & Improvement projects that are awarded to federally owned sites. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2023 budget submission for Maintenance & Improvement of $346 m illion is $ 176 million above the FY 2022 Enacted level. FY 2022 Base Funding of $170 million - Supports maintenance, repair, and improvements for existing IHS and Tribal facilities. FY 2023 Funding Increase of +$176 million includes : C urrent Services of +$4 million, including: o I nflation +$931,000 to fund inflationary costs of providing health care services. o Population Growth +$3 million - to address the impact of the additional services need arising from the growing AI/AN population. The IHS projects a population growth rate of 1.8 percent in CY 2022 based on state births and deaths data. Maintenance and Improvement: +$172 million would provide resources to the fund critical Backlog of Essential Maintenance and Repair (BEMAR) . Facility deficiencies/BEMAR and medical equipment are complex and involve many variables such as accreditation standards, healthcare patient satisfaction, changing healthcare delivery standards, building codes, old building equipment/system, and medical devices/equipment plus telemedicine used by healthcare professionals. The total $ 346 million funding request for FY 2023 would support: CJ - 206 Approximately $105 million is the projected amount for routine maintenance and repair to sustain the condition of federal and Tribal healthcare facilities buildings. These funds will support facilities activities that are generally classified as those needed for 'sustainment' of existing facilities and provided to the IHS Area Offices and to Tribes for daily maintenance activities and local projects to maintain the current state of health care facilities. These Routine Maintenance Funds may be used for Area and Tribal M&I projects to fund smaller elements of the backlog of work to address the old and antiquated facilities plant infrastructure (e.g., mechanical and electrical BEMAR) and program enhancements. Approximately $238 million would be available for major Area and Tribal M&I projects to reduce the BEMAR deficiencies and to improve healthcare facilities to meet changing healthcare delivery needs. The FY 2023 Budget Request continues funding critical projects to address the old and antiquated facilities plant infrastructure (e.g., mechanical and electrical BEMAR), accreditation standards, and program enhancements, all of which is essential to support health del ivery. Approximately $3 million would be available for environmental compliance projects. The IHS places a high priority on meeting Federal, State, and local legal/regulatory environmental requirements, including allocating funding to address findings and recommendations from environmental audits. The IHS has currently identified approximately $7 million in environmental compliance tasks and included them in the BEMAR database. M&I funds, a portion from above categories retained by Headquarters, also provide resources for the demolition of IHS facilities that are no longer needed. The IHS has approximately 100 Federally owned buildings that are vacant, excess, or obsolete. Many of these buildings are safety and security hazards. IHS plans for ord erly demolition of some of these buildings, in concert with transferring others, reducing hazards and liability. Demolition Funds may be used in concert with environmental compliance funds as available for demolition of the Federal buildings to the extent that the proposed action reduces hazards, environmental concerns, or liability to the Indian Health Service. Since FY 2000 when funds were first set aside for the demolition of Federal buildings, associated demolition costs have risen significantly due to inflation, environmental regulations, recycling and landfill diversion requirements, abatement of hazardous material, etc. For example, many IHS locations are very remote which significantly increases the cost to haul the demolition waste off the reservat ion to approved landfills and recycling facilities. OUTPUT S / OUTCOME S The Outcomes for this program are measured through BEMAR, i.e., progress in addressing maintenance needs and facility deficiencies. Maintaining effective and efficient healthcare buildings improve the ease and access to care, facilitate successful behavioral health services, and enable the hiring and retention of healthcare professionals by giving them modern space and equipment to deliver services. IHS targets the M&I funding, and supplements these funds with collections where available, towards major projects to reduce the BEMAR and improve the condition of existing Federal and Tribal healthcare sites. A few e xample s of these projects include: renovating/expanding pharmac y space , improvements to dental clinics to serve more users, remodeling reception/waiting areas, construction of CT suite and new digital radiology rooms , repaving parking lots, emergency department renovations, new heating- ventilation -air conditions systems, sustainability projects to CJ - 207reduce utility costs, etc. Continued investment in the BEMAR which is currently at $1 billion , will enable IHS and the Tribe s to maintain accreditation standards and delivery quality health care services.

Needs- based priority system for construction project fund allocation and implemented through P.L. 86-121 Memorandum of Agreements, P.L. 93-638 Self-Determination Contracts and Self-Governance Construction Project Agreements. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Care Improve ment Act (IHCIA) requires the Indian Health Service ( IHS) to identify the universe of sanitation facilities needs for existing American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) homes by documenting deficie ncies and pro posing projects to address their needs. These projects prevent communicable diseases by pr oviding new and existing homes with s ervices such as water wells, onsite wastewater disposal systems, or connections to community water supply and wastewater disposal systems. These projects can also include provision of new or upgraded water supply or waste disposal systems. These outcomes support both the HHS and IHS Strategic Plans . (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023, Objective 1.3: Increase access to quality health care services. Strategy 14, \" Develop and coordinate environmental engineering, environmental health, and health facilities engineering services to provide effective and efficient public health services... \"). The four types of sanitation facilities projects funded through IHS are: (1) projects to serve existing housing; (2) projects to serve new or like-new housing, such as Indian homes being constructed or rehabilitated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)- Home Improvement Program, Tribe s, individual homeowners, or other nonprofit organizations; (3) special projects (studies, training or other needs related to sanitation facilities construction); and (4) emergency projects. Projects that serve new or like-new housing are funded based on a priority classification system. Projects that provide sanitation facilities to existing homes are selected for funding in priority order each year from the Sanitation Deficiency System (SDS). The SDS is an inventory of the sanitation deficiencies of federal ly recognized AI/AN eligible homes and communities; th e sanitation deficiencies include needed water, sewer, and solid waste facilities for existing AI/AN homes. These actions support Strategy 1, \" Improve the transparency and quality of data collected regarding health care service and program outcomes \" (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Objective 2.1: Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization ). Project selection is driven by CJ - 209objective evaluati on criteria including health impact, existing deficiency level, adequacy of previous service, capital cost, local Tribal priority, operations and maintenance capacity of the receiving entity, availability of contributions from non- IHS sources, and other conditions that are locally determined. The SDS priority position of each unfunded project is reevaluated with the Tribe s in each Area annually. Sanitation Facilities Construction (S FC) projects can be managed by IHS directly or by Tribe s that elect to use the Title I or Title V authorization under P.L. 93-638, the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. Sanitation facilities projects are carried out cooperat ively with the Tribe s that will be served, and construction is performed by either the IHS or the Tribe s (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 - 2023, Objective 1.2: Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships ). Projects start with a Tribal project proposal and are funded and implemented through execution of an agreement between a Tribe and IHS. In t hese agreements, the Tribe s also assume ownership responsibilities, including operation and maintenance. The overall SFC goals, reporting requirements, eligibility criteria, project planning, and funding priorities remain the same, regardless of the delivery methods chosen by a Tribe . The SFC Program leverages its capabilities in partnering with Tribes by also partnering with other Federal agencies in constructing or financing construction of water supply, wastewater and solid waste disposal projects addressing sanitation deficiencies faced by Tribes. One way in which the SFC Program engages in such partnerships is through the Infrastructure Task Force (ITF), a partnership of Federal agencies focused on f inding ways to better serve Tribes through cooperative efforts (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 - 2023, Objective 1.2: Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships ). PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS The SFC Program is an integral component of IHS disease prevention activities. IHS has carried out the program since 1959 using funds appropriated to provide water and waste disposal facilities for eligible AI/AN homes and communities. As a result, infant mortality rates and mortality rate s for gastroenteritis and other environmentally -related diseases have declined. Research supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states populations in regions with a lower proportion of homes with water service, reflect significantly h igher hospitalization rates for pneumonia, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus . 1 Researchers associate d the increasing illnesses with the restricted access to clean water for hand washing and hygiene. The SFC Program works collaboratively with Tribes to assure all AI/AN homes and communities are provided with safe and adequate water supply and waste disposal facilities as soon as possible. In FY 2021, IHS funded projects to provide service to 48,816 AI/AN homes . IHS also completed construction on 250 projects with an average project duration of 3.6years. However, at the end of FY 2021about 7,228, or 1.9 percent of all AI/AN homes tracked by IHS lacked water supply or wastewater disposal facilities ; and, about 108,459 or approximately 29percent of AI/AN homes tracked by IHS were in need of some form of sanitation facilities improvements. The individuals who live in homes without adequate sanitation facilities are at a higher risk for gastrointestinal disease, respiratory disease and other chronic diseases.2 Many of these homes without service are very remote and may have limited access to health care which increases the importance of improving environmental conditions. 1 Thomas W. Hennessy, Troy Ritter, Robert C. Holman, Dana L. Bruden, Krista L. Yorita, Lisa Bulkow, James E. Cheek, Rosalyn J. Singleton, and Jeff Smith. The Relationship Between In -Home Water Service and the Risk of Respiratory Tract, Skin, and Gastrointes tinal Tract Infections Among Rural Alaska Natives. American Journal of Public Health: November 2008, Vol. 98, No. 11, pp. 2072 -2078. CJ - 210 The total sanitation facility need reported through SDS has increased approxim ately $0.27 billion or 8.7 percent from $3.09 billion to $3.36 billion from FY 2020 to FY 2021. In FY 2020, the IHS was appropriated $0.20 billion to address sanitation deficiencies and support provision of sanitation facilities to eligible AI/AN homes and communities. The magnitude of the sanitation facility needs increase is due to the underlying challenges of construction cost inflation, population growth, an increasing number of regulations, and failing infrastructure. Failing infrastructure is presumably the largest factor, which is a result of the infrastructure age and inadequate operation and maintenance. Under the IHCIA, the IHS is authorized to provide operation and maintenance assistance for, and emergency repairs to, Tribal sanitation facilities, when necessary to avoid a health hazard or to protect the Federal investment in sanitation facilities, however resources have not been appropriated specifically for this purpose . During FY 2021, 390 construction projects to address water supply and wastewater disposal needs were funded with a construction cost of $220 million using IHS and contributed funds. Once constructed, these sanitation facilities will benefit an estimated 188,000 AI/AN people and help avoid over 379,600 inpatient an d outpatient visits related to respiratory, skin and soft tissue, and gastro enteric disease over 30 years. The health care cost savings for these visits alone is estimated to be over $403 million . Every $1 spent on water and sewer infrastructure will save $ 1.23 in avoided direct healthcare cost. These outcomes support Strategy 14, \"Develop and coordinate environmental engineering, environmental health, and health facilities engineering services to provide effective and efficient public health services...\". (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 - 2023, Objective 1.3: Increase access to quality health care services). In FY 2023, t he SFC Program will continue to focus on improving quality of data reported through the SDS on the sanitation facility needs supporting AI/AN homes and communities (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Objective 2.1: Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization ). These efforts will ensure the sanitation facilities needs included in SDS are: Associated with timely completion of design and construction activities on funded sanitation facilities projects; Adequately documented; Reflect an update of current needs ; and Include only sanitation facilities fun dable by the SFC program for AI/AN eligible homes and communiti es and consistent with the prescribed Deficiency Levels referenced in the IHCIA . Additionally, in FY 2023, the SFC Program will continue to focus on maintaining average construction project duration of 4.0 years. In order to achieve this outcome, the FY 2023 President's Budget includes a corresponding request for +$49 million in the Facilities and Environmental Health Support budget line to support additional hiring for IHS SFC projects, and to provide program support funding to Tribes that choose to implement their own projects. Consistent with existing practice, funds will only be obligated to projects that have been certified by the SFC Program Areas as \"ready to fund\"; this means they have a well -defined scope, a detailed cost estimate, a compl eted preliminary design and that known potential risks to project construction, operation and maintenance have been considered and mitigated.

FY 2022 Base Funding of $198 million including : Up to $80 million will be used to serve new and like- new homes, which are non- Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD) homes ( HUD homes are served under HUD authorities and appropriations ). Some of these funds may also be used for san itation facilities for individual homes of the disabled or sick , with a physician referral , indicating an immediate medical need for adequate sanitation facilities in their home.3 As needed, amounts to serve new and like -new homes will be established by He adquarters after reviewing Area proposals. Priority will be given to projects under the BIA Housing Improvement Program (HIP) to serve new and like -new homes with the exception of \"Category A\" BIA HIP homes which are considered existing homes and will be served with the funds described in this section . The IHS appropriated funds for sanitation facilities construction are prohibited by law from being used to provide sanitation facilities for new homes funded with grants by the housing programs of HUD. These HUD housing grant programs for new homes should continue to incorporate funding for the sanitation facilities necessary for those homes. Up to $55 million 4 will be used to cover cost increases due to inflation on projects funded during the pandemic with p re-pandemic cost estimates serving AI/AN homes and communities. Up to $55 million may be distributed to the Areas for prioritized projects identified in the IHS data system as Tier 1 Ready to Fund serving existing homes, based on a formula that considers, among other factors, the cost of facilities to serve existing homes that: (a) have not received sanitation facilities for the first time, or (b) are served by sanitation facilities that are in need of some form of improvement. Another element of the dist ribution formula is a weight factor that favors Areas with larger numbers of AI/AN homes without water supply or sewer facilities, or without both. If there are insufficient Tier 1 projects then these funds will be used to support project planning, design, and construction administration to address existing sanitation deficiencies impacting AI/AN homes are fully designed and construction ready in FY2024. These funds will be used in conjunction with the FY 2023 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Up to $6 million will be reserved at IHS Headquarters for special projects to include up to $4 million for data migration of available water and wastewater system data from tribally owned and operated systems serving AI/AN homes and communities from electronic or paper file formats.

Direct Federal, P.L. 93- 638 Self - Determination Contracts and Self -Governance Compacts Construction Project Agreements PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Health Service ( IHS) Health Care Facilities Construction (HCFC) funds provide optimum availability of functional, modern IHS and tribally operated health care facilities and where required staff quarters. The IHS is authorized to construct health care facilities and staff quarters, support Tribal construction of facilities under the Joint Venture Construction Program (JVCP), provide construction funding for Tribal projects Under the S mall Ambulatory Program (SAP) , and provide funding to construct new and replacement dental uni ts. The construction and modernization of IHS infrastructure through the health care facilities construction program helps ensure the IHS commitment to the Department of Health and Human Services Strategic Objectives 1.2: Expand safe, high-quality healthcare options, and encourage innovation and competition; and 1.3: Improve Americans' access to healthcare and expand choice of care and service options. The health care facilities constructed by the IHS ensure access to quality, culturally competent health c are for one of the lowest income populations in the United States, American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). The focus of the IHS health care service programs provided in these facilities is on prevention and delivery of comprehensive primary care in a community setting. The HCFC program is funded based on an IHS-wide list of priorities for construction projects. During FY 1990, at the direction of Congress , the IHS established the Health Facilities Construction Priority System (HFCPS) methodology. The HFCPS ranks proposals using factors reflecting the total amount of space needed , age and condition of the existing health care facility, if any, degree of isolation of the population to be served in the proposed health care facility , and availability of alternate health care resources. The remaining health care facilities projects on the HFCPS list, inclu ding those partially funded, total approximately $2.00 billion as of January 2021. The reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) includes a provision, \"any project established under the construction priority system in effect on the date of enactment of the Act of 2009 shall not be affected by any change in the construction priority system taking place after that date... \" Total need for the HCFC Program is approximately CJ - 214$15 billion for expanded and active authority facility types according to The 2016 Indian Health Service and Tribal Health Care Facilities' Needs Assessment Report to Congress. The Joint Venture Construction Program ( JVCP ) authorizes IHS to enter into agreements with Tribes that construct their own health care facilities. The Tribe provides the resources, whether from its own funds, through financing, grants, contributions, or a combination thereof, for the construction of its health care facility . IHS health care facility construction appropriations are not used for construction of facilities in the JVCP but may be used to equip the health care facility. Tribes apply for the JVCP during a competitive process and the approved projects are enter ed into agreements with IHS. B ased on the date of projected completion of construction by the respective Tribe, the IHS agrees to request a funding increase from Congress for additional staffing and operations consistent with a fully executed beneficial occupancy of the health care facility. The Small Ambulatory Program (SAP) provides funding for small T ribal health care facilities . The SAP is authorized by Section 306 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, Public Law 94-437, and projects are competitively selected for funding as funds are appropriated. The SAP program is available for AI /AN Tribes or T ribal organizat ions to competitively obtain funding for the construction, expansion or modernization of tribally owned small ambulatory health care facilities. The selected projects will not be a part of the IHS HFCPS. These three programs implement the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 by increasing access to culturally appropriate health care services for American Indian and Alaska Native people. IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2 is supported when a new facility is completed . A new facility is designed to meet the demand for health services from a growing population by providing more healthcare providers and exam rooms, dentists and dental chairs, improved imaging systems, and expanded services such as eye care and audiology. Each new facility includes a component to address behavioral health issues. Administration staff is increased to strengthen management, collections and bring health care quality expertise to the replacement facility. Each facility also incorporates additional space for Tribal health programs which compl ements IHS programs and how the HCFC programs are implementing. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Each healthcare facility project that is completed increases access to much needed health care services. Each completed replacement facility is typically larger to meet the increased demand for health services from a growing population. Tribes typically provide land, at no cost to the Federal Government, for the new or replacement health care facility. The FY 2021 appropriation contributed to the Phoenix Indian Medical Center, Phoenix, AZ, the Whiteriver Hospital, Whiteriver, AZ; Gallup Indian Medical Center, Gallup NM; Bodaway Gap Health Center, The Gap, AZ ; Albuquerque West Health Center, Albuquerque, NM ; Albuquerque Central Health Center, Albuquerque, NM and S ells Alternative Rural Hospital, Sells, AZ projects. The FY 2021 appropriation also contributed $25 million to the IHS SAP , $10 million to the Staff Quarters Program and $5 million to the Green Infrastructure Program. The selection and agreements to award the funds for staff quarters and the Green Infrastructure has occurred and the SAP applications are due from Tribes by July 1, 2022. CJ - 215The FY 2022 appropriation will fund the Rapid City Health Center, Rapid City, SD; Alamo Health Center, Alamo, NM; Puebl o Pintado Health Center, Pueblo Pintado, Center, Phoenix, AZ, Whiteriver Hospital, Whiteriver, AZ; Gallup Indian Medical Center, Gallup, NM; and Sells Alternative Rural Hospital, Sells, AZ projects. The FY 2022 appropriation w ill also contribute $ 25 million to the IHS SAP , $10 million to the Staff Quarters Program and $5 million to the Green Infrastructure Program. The selection and agreements to award the funds is beginning in late FY 2022 . The JVCP has saved the Federal Government over $1 billion dollars in capital expenses since its inception. The outcome of the JVCP provides the same accomplishments as described above. The federal construction and the Joint Venture programs bring new and increased health care capacity to AI/AN communities where there is a great need. These activities increase the access to quality healthcare in these underserved communities.

FY 2022 Base Funding of $259 million - Supports Health Care Facilities Construction for new and replacement IHS and Tribal health care facilities. FY 2023 Funding Increase of +$276 million includes C urrent Services of +$603,000, including: o I nflation +$603,000 to fund inflationary costs of providing health care services. Health Care Facilities Construction : +$276 million - to continue to fund the projects on the 1993 IHS Health Care Facilities Construction Priority List and support other targeted facilities programs including a new mid -sized ambulatory demonstration program . These health care facilities will improve access to direct health care services in the communities they serve. T he total $546 million requested for FY 2023 would support: Phoenix Indian Medical Center, Phoenix, AZ $48.5 million These funds will be used to plan, purchase land, and design the facility . The new Phoenix Indian Medical Center Health Care System is planned to decentralize a substantial portion of the primary care services workload to three new satellite facilities. The three satellite facilities CJ - 216are located in the southwest valley, the sou theast valley, and in the northeast valley. The satellite facilities are located closer to the user's communities to provide more access to care. A new Central facility will be a major resource to the satellite facilities. The Central facility will be designed and equipped with full telemedicine support and visiting professionals to provide specialty care services, and will continue to serve as a referral hospital for specialty consultation and procedures. Whiteriver Hospital, Whiteriver, AZ $100 million These funds will be used to begin construction of the replacement hospital. It will serve a projected user population of 36,113 providing 67,000 primary care provider visits and 101,200 outpatient visits annually. This project also includes an estimated 144 staff quarters for health care professionals serving at the facility. Gallup Indian Medical Center, Gallup, NM $48.5 million These funds will be used to plan, purchase land, and design the facility . The proposed replacement Gallup Indian Medical Center will provide comprehensive inpatient, ambulatory, behavioral, and preventive health services for the Gallup Service Unit. The projects will also provide specialty care and inpatient care services to support other Navajo Area service units. Bodaway Gap Health Center, The Gap, AZ $118 million These funds will be used to complete construction of the health center and 82 staff quarters located in The Gap, AZ. The Health Center will serve a projected user population of 4,646 generating 18,458 primary care provider visits annually. The facility will provide an expanded outpatient and community health department, and a full array of ancillary and support services. Albuquerque West Health Center, Albuquerque, NM $40 million These funds will be used to complete the construction of the health center located in the west side of Albuquerque, NM. The land donated for the Albuquerque West Health Center was evaluated and was found not sutable, therefore IHS to pu rchase land for the facility in the Albuquerque area. These funds will be use to purcha se land. Sells Health Center, Sells, AZ $ 1 21 million These funds will complete the construction of the health center and staff quarters in the Sells, AZ. The Sells Health Center will consist of approximately 210,000 GSF of space. The Health Center will serve a projected user population of 21,400 generating 38,200 primary care provider visits annually. The facility will provide an expanded outpatient and community health department, and a full array of ancillary and support services. New and Replacement Staff Quarters $ 25 million Many of the 2,700 quarters across the IHS health delivery system are more than 40 years old and in need of major renovation or total replacement. Additionally, in a number of locations the amount of housing units is insufficient. The identified unmet need, of housing units in isolated, remote locations is a significant barrier to the recruitment and retention of quali ty healthcare professionals across Indian Country. This funding level would fully-fund the current need for 990 new or replacement staff quarters. The amount distributed to each Area will be based on each Area's internal priority list. CJ - 217Small Ambulatory $ 30 million These resources would support up to 10 small ambulatory facilities in American Indian and Alaska Native communities. Consistent with prior years, the IHS will request applications from interested Tribes. Funds will support for construction, expansion or modernization of non-IHS owned small Tribal ambulatory health care facilities located apart from a hospital. Green Infrastructure: $5 million The Indian Health Service will use these funds to incorporate green infrastructure and the most current energy efficiency codes and standards available in its planning, design, and operations of buildings to the maximum extent practicable. This approach will reduce costs, minimize environmental impacts, and use renewable energy. Mid- Sized Ambulatory Demonstration Projects: $10 million This new effort would fund 2 small to medium ambulatory health care facilities projects, ranging from $ 4 million to $5 million in cost. Each project would follow the IHS Area's Master Plan and fit within the framework of the IHS Area Health Services Delivery Plan. These facilities would support a broader array of in- house services that a smaller clinic could not supp ort. Each project would include a staffing package based on the identified in- house services to be requested as future staffing of new facilities funding. o Many American Indian and Alaska Natives are unable to access high quality health care services in their communities due to lack of health care facilities infrastructure. While IHS has a number of facilities programs at its disposal, each has its own limitations, which means that ambulatory facilities that are larger than what can be supported by the Small Ambulatory Program ($2 million per facility) but smaller than the Joint Venture Program, fall through the cracks. Further, the IHS' current programs provide funding for small facilities with no staffing funding, and staffing for tribally constructed programs under the Joint Venture Program, which have the capital for major construction projects. o This program would provide the initial funding to construct a facility of this size, and provide recurring staffing funding to e nsure that the facility can provide the health care services envisioned in its design. o Each project in this program has the potential to provide basic health care needs to 3,000 to 5,000 AI/AN individuals. o By increasing the capacity of health care facilities to serve AI/AN communities, it increases access to critical health services that ultimately results in better health outcomes. These results have been documented by improvements in the rates of Years of Potential Life Lost at new facilities when they have been completed and staffed.

Direct Federal, P.L. 93-638 Self-Determination Contracts and Self- Governance Compacts and competitive cooperative agreements SUMMARY OF PROGRAM S Facilities and Environmental Health Support Account (FEHS) programs provide and support an extensive array of real property, health care facilities and staff quarters construction, maintenance and operation services, as well as community and institutional environmental health, injury prevention, and sanitation facilities construction services. The programs directly and indirectly support all of the IHS facilities performance measures and improved access to quality health services. The programs and staff at the IHS Headquarters, Area Office, and Service Unit levels work collaboratively with Tribes and other agencies to promote and provide access to improvements in public health through surveillance, education, intervention activities, construction of sanita tion facilities and health care facilities. These activities are aligned in sub - activities: Facilities Support, Environmental Health Support, and Office of Environmental Health and Engineering Support. In addition to personnel salary and benefits costs, funding under this activity is used for utilities, certain non -medical supplies and personal property, and biomedical equipment repair. The IHS may use a limited amount of these FEHS funds for centrally charged assessments that benefit the staff and activities funded through the Indian Health Facilities appropriations. To date, the majority of IHS's assessments have been paid through the Indian Health Services appropriation; however, the amount of assessment costs have exceeded the amount of funds availab le within Services. In order to continue the emphasis on direct patient care, these FEHS funds that provide other types of administrative support for the Facilities appropriation may share in appropriate assessment charges proportionate to the underlying a ctivities. For example, a centrally managed assessment for payroll services that is charged by the number of employees may be proportionately paid under both the Services and Facilities appropriations according to the number of staff supported by each appropriation. CJ - 220F ACILITIES SUPPORT PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Facilities Support Account (FS) provides funding for Area and Service Unit staff for facilities - related management activities, operation and maintenance of real property and building systems, medical equipment technical support, and planning and construction management support for n ew and replacement health facilities projects. The sub- activity directly supports the IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023 priorities: (1) People - Recruit, develop, and retain a dedicated, competent, caring workforce collaborating to achieve the IHS mission ; (2) Partnerships- Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships that advance the IHS mission ; (3) Quality - Excellence in everything we do to assure a high-performing Indian health system; and (4) R esources- Secure and effectively manage the assets needed to promote the IHS mission. Facilit ies operations, maintenance, repair, and improvements address deficiencies/BEMAR and medical equipment , which are complex and involve many variables such as accreditation standards, healthcare patient satisfaction, changing healthcare delivery standards, building codes, old building equipment/system, and medical devices/equipment plus telemedicine used by healthcare professionals. The IHS owns approximately 10,850,000 square feet of facilities (totaling 2,147 buildings) and 1,760 acres of federal and trust land. The nature of space varies from sophisticated medical centers to residential units and utility plants. Facilities range in age from less than one year to more than 169 years, with an average age greater than 40 years. A professional and fully - functional workforce is essential to ensure effective and efficient operations. An estimated 600 Federal positions (fulltime equivalents) are funded under this sub- activity. Typical s taff functions funded may include: Facilities engineers and maintenance staff responsible for ensuring that building systems are operated properly, facilities and grounds are maintained adequately, utilities are managed appropriately, environmental compl iance requirements are met, and buildings are safe; Specialized clinical engineers and technicians who maintain and service medical equipment; Realty staff that manages the real property requirements and quarters; and Facilities planning , project managemen t, and construction- monitoring that assist in the planning and construction of projects. In addition, FS provides partial funding for related Area and Service Unit operating costs, such as utilities, building operation supplies, facilities- related personal property, and biomedical equipment repair and maintenance. Accomplishments include supporting health delivery through the attainment of accreditation and the maintenance of the environment of care of buildings, utility systems, life safety systems, and medical equipment. Adequate facilities/maintenance staffing both at the Area Offices and service units are paramount to maintain accreditation, for the continuity of health services, and ensur ing that major building system s function correctly . Workload for the facilities and biomedical staff has continued to increase to meet the Agency's emphasis on accreditation standards and supporting program enhancements/expansion, which is predominately funded with collections. In consultation with Tribes and the Federal healthcare sites, IHS is coordinating with and allocating funding to the IHS Area Offices to complete BEMAR projects to make renovations and CJ - 221i mprovements necessary to support health care delivery in the health care facilities and to modernize the health care facilities and staff quarters to expand access to quality health care services including modern medical equipment. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Maintaining effective and efficient healthcare buildings and equipment improve the eas e and access to care, facilitate successful behavioral health services, and enable the hiring and retention of healthcare professionals by giving them modern space and equipment to deliver services. This is all integral to quality health care for AI/ANs. The Facilities Support Account and associated staffing level directly supports to the medical equipment, maintenance and repair of, and adjustments/modifications to IHS and Tribal healthcare sites to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus/COVID -19 medical services. In FY 2021, total utility costs were $15.6 million and total utility costs per Gross Square Feet (GSF) were $2.97/GSF. In FY 2023, the total utility cost is expected to be $17.0 million reflecting a 9.0 percent annual increase. The cost per GSF is expected to rise to approximately $3.23/GSF. IHS makes conscious efforts to help stem the growth in utility costs to ensure appropriations are sufficient to fund these needs. For example, IHS constructs new space that is at least 30 percent more energy efficient than building code requires and expects LEED Silver certification at those facilities. Additionally, IHS seeks opportunities to fund renewable energy systems at IHS and tribally owned installations. For example, a current project is installing additional solar panels at the Fort Yuma Health Care Center in Yuma, Arizona, which has the potential to make the site net zero electricity. ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Environmental Health Support Account (EHSA) provides funding for IHS Area, District, and Service Unit management activities and environmental health staff which include engineers, environmental health officers, engineering aides, injury prevention specialists, and institutional environmental health officers. More than 70 percent of these IHS and Tribal staff live and work in Tribal communities; another 20 percent provide regional services to Tribes or IHS facilities; and less than 10 percent of our staff are administrative managers. AI/ANs face h azards in their environments that affect their health status, including communities in remote and isolated locations, severe climatic conditions, limited availability of safe housing, lack of safe water supply, and lack of publi c health and safety legislat ion (e.g., lack of local solid waste ordinances, vehicle safety laws, or food safety laws). In accordance with congressional direction, these funds are distributed to the Areas based upon the workload and need associated with the two programs noted below. S anitation Facilities Construction Program (SFC) - This program is an integral component of IHS disease prevention activities. IHS has carried out the program since 1959 using funds appropriated for SFC to provide safe water supply and waste disposal facilities for AI/AN people and communities. As a result, infant mortality rates and mortality rates for gastroenteritis and other environmentally -related diseases have been reduced. Research supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention st ates populations in regions with a lower proportion of home s with water service, reflect significantly higher CJ - 222hos pitalization rates for pneumonia, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus.1 Researchers associate the increasing illnesses with the restricted access to clean water for hand washing and hygiene. The absence of clean water to sanitation facilities for tribal households exacerbate concern for the Indian Health Service Clinical Health Care program; further decreasing the quality of life for A I/ANs. Efforts by other public health specialists such as nutritionists and public health nurses are much more effective when safe water and adequate wastewater disposal systems are available in the home. In addition, the availability of such facilities is o f fundamental importance to social and economic development, which leads to an improved quality of life and an improved sense of well-being. The SFC Program work s collaboratively with tribes to assure all AI/AN homes and communities are provided with safe and adequate water supply and waste disposal systems as soon as possible (IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 - 2023, Objective 1.2: Build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships) . Under this program in FY 2020, staff managed and/or provided professional engineering services for 545 new sanitation projects with a total cost of over $ 302 million , including IHS funds and contributions from Tribes and other agencies. The program manages annual project funding that includes contribut ions from Tribes, states, and other federal agencies. The SFC Program is the environmental engineering component of the IHS health delivery system. Services funded include management of staff, pre-planning, consultation with Tribes, coordination with other federal, state and local governmental entities, identifying supplemental funding outside of IHS, developing local policies and guidelines with Tri bal consultation, developing agreements with Tribes and others for each project, providing professional engineering design and/or construction services for water supply and waste disposal facilities, assuring environmental and historical preservation procedures are followed, and assisting Tribes where the Tribes provide construction management. Consistent with the 1994 Congressional set aside for \"...tribal training on the operation and maintenance of sanitation facilities,\" $1 million of these support funds are used for technical assistance, training, and guidance to Indian families and communities regarding the operation and maintenance of water supply and sewage disposal facilities. In accordance with the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, the staff annually updates its inventory of sanitation facilities deficiencies for existing Indian occupied homes. 2 This is accomplished through extensive consultation with Tribes. The SFC staff also develops and updates an inventory of all open dump sites on Indian lands as required under the Indian Lands Open Dump Cleanup Act. 3 Both of these inventories are widely used by other governmental agencies in their evaluation and funding of sanitation facilities construction projects. The IIJA appropriates $700 million in each year from FY 2022 - FY 2026, for a total of $3.5 billion for the IHS Sanitation Facilities Construction (SFC) program. These resources are available until expended, for the provision of domestic and community sanitation facilities for Indians, as authorized. Funding from the IIJA appropriation will be used to fund sanitation facilities construction projects listed in the I HS 1 Thomas W. Hennessy, Troy Ritter, Robert C. Holman, Dana L. Bruden, Krista L.

Environmental Health Services (EHS) - National priority areas include: food safety, children's environments, healthy homes, vector -borne and communicable disease, and safe drinking water. The EHS Program identifies environmental hazards and risk factors in Tribal communities and proposes control measures to prevent adverse health effects. The EHS Program monitors and investigates disease and injury. The program provides inspections to identify environmental hazards in homes, healthcare facilities, food service establishments, Head Start centers, and many other types of Tribal establishments. In addition, EHS provides training, technical assistance, and cooperative agreements to enhance the capacity of Tribal commun ities to address environmental health issues. E HS provides access to public health services to AI/ANs. Examples include : referrals for home investigations to reduce environmental triggers for asthma patients; home investigations to reduce exposure to lea d-based paint or other lead hazards (including drinking water sources) for patients with elevated blood- lead levels; animal bite investigations in Tribal communities and potential patient exposure to rabies virus; home investigations to address fall risk for elderly and other patients at risk for falls; and referrals for investigation of communicable disease outbreaks from patient exposures to contaminated food or water. The IHS Injury Prevention Program (IPP) leads IHS efforts to address injury disparitie s between AI/AN communities and U.S. all races. AI/AN experience injury mortality rates that are 2.5 to 8.7 times higher than the U. S. all races rates 4. The IPP works with AI/AN, other agencies, and IHS programs to prevent unintentional injuries (e.g., motor vehicle -related, falls, burns, drowning, poisoning) and intentional injuries (e.g., suicide and violence- related) through technical assistance, training, and the Tribal Injury Prevention Cooperative Agreement Program (TIPCAP). Technical assistance is provided in the areas of data collection for project evaluation, building partnerships, implementing evidence- based strategies or innovative interventions, and developing tribal injury prevention programs. The IHS Institutional Environmental Health (IEH) Program identifies hazards and risk factors in the built environment and proposes control measures to prevent adverse health effects to patients, staff, and visitors in health care and other community facilities. The IEH program supports development and management of safe, functional health care facilities which contributes to the quality of care and workforce retention. The IEH program collaborates with entities such as the National Institutes of Health, Administration for Children and Families, and Uni formed Services University to improve IEH practices in IHS facilities and in our tribal communities. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Environmental Health Services (EHS) staff have been involved with all aspects and at all levels of the National COVID -19 Pandemic response. The Division of Environmental Health Services has collaborated with Federal partners such as, National Indian Gaming Commission, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of the Interior, and the Bureau of Indian Education by servi ng as Subject Matter Experts for policy and guidance on the reopening of Tribal gaming facilities and tribal schools nationally. EHS staff remain focused on the community- based environmental health services by assisting tribal operations and businesses plan and prepare to reopen during COVID-19. EHS staff throughout the Indian Health Service are serving in critical leadership positions of the COVID -19 response. For example, many Environmental Health staff 4 Trends in Indian Health 2017 Edition, IHS, Division of Program Statistics CJ - 224ser ve as Incident Commanders, Safety Officers, IH S Area Emergency Management Points-of- Contact, Logistics Chief, and Liaisons to state and local emergency management entities. EHS staff accomplishments reduce the need for direct healthcare services when environmentally related diseases and injuries are prevented . For example , the IHS Injury Prevention Program has been instrumental in reducing the injury mortality rate of AI/ANs by implementing a public health approach based upon effective strategies and initiatives to reduce the devastating burden of injuries. Preventing severe, debilitating injuries reduce s the cost and need for healthcare service ; however, the challenge remains that unintentional injuries are still the leading cause of death for AI/ANs ages 1 -44. 5 From 1997-2021 the TIPCAP funded 106 fulltime tribal injury prevention positions and provided over $34 million in funding. Through these efforts the IHS IPP has contributed to the 58 percent decrease in injury mortality rates since 197 3 and continues to invest in preventing injuries, instead of treating the impacts of injury and violence through our health care delivery system. In FY 2021, the TIPCAP 2021-2025 five year funding cycle began in which 27 tribes or tribal programs from eleven IHS Areas we awarded a cumulative total of $2.4M per year. This new cycle of funding addresses motor vehicle related injuries, falls, and other emerging issues based on tribal needs. These could include, poisoning/opioids, suicide, traumatic brain injury , or drowning. Strategic Goal 3: Strengthen the Economic and Social Well- Being of Americans Across the Lifespan. Strategic Objective 3.2: Safeguard the public against preventable injuries and violence or their results. The IEH Program provides extensive technical assistance and training to safety and facility management staff as well as the many inter- related medical program and leadership staff . These efforts have led to a reduction in the IHS total occupational injury & illness case rate which has decreased from 4.35 injuries/100 employees in 2004 t o 1.43 injuries & illness /100 employees in 2021. The IEH program supports healthcare management by providing local accreditation support including mock environment of care surveys in which regulatory requirements and conditions for general safety, environmental infection control, fire safety, and chemical safety are a ssessed and recommendations for corrective action are provided. The IEH Program works to foster multi- disciplinary engagement amongst all levels of the organization to improve transparency and efficiency. Staff engage Tribal, county, and state public health and public safety officials in Tribal communities. For example, staff engage local Bureau of Indian Affairs law enforcement or Tribal police to enhance motor vehicle related injury prevention efforts through child safety seat interventions and enhanced police enforcement activities such as seat belt usage or driving un der the influence checkpoints. S taff work extensi vely with Tribal, county, and state health departments on a variety of public health issues including response to foodborne (i.e., salmonellosis), vector borne (i.e., bubonic plague, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, hantavirus), and waterborne (i.e. legionellosis) disease outbreaks. Other examples of collaboration include surveillance activities related to emerging diseases and public health emergency preparedness. Strategic Goal 2: Protect the Health of Amer icans Where They Live, Learn, Work, and Play. Strategic Objective 2.2: Prevent, treat, and control communicable diseases and chronic conditions and Strategic Objective 2.4: Prepare for and respond to public health emergencies. 5 Indian Health Focus: Injuries, 2017 Edition CJ - 225F UNDING Enacted President's Budget $371,326,000 BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2023 budget submission for Facilities and Environmental Health Support of $371 million is $88 million above the FY 2022 Enacted level.

A description of these activities along with program accomplishments is included below. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ( IIJA) SFC Implementation: +$ 49 million to support the implementation of the $3.5 million provided by the IIJA for SFC. This funding will support additional salary, expenses, and administrative costs beyond the 3 percent allowed in the IIJA. These funds would also be available to Tribal Health Programs, unlike the 3 percent administrative set -aside in the IIJA. This additional funding is necessary to maintain existing CJ - 226p roject completion dead lines and will support IHS and Tribes in successfully implementing IIJA resources. Specific activities supported will include: Hiring additional engineering staff to m anage project workload and fill current vacancies; Hiring additional Contracting Specialists and Contracting O fficer Representatives to support expanded contracting activities; Hiring additional HR specialists to recruit and retain the staff necessary to complete these projects; and Purchasing additional hardware and software licenses to support the additional pro ject load. Public Health Engineers Pipeline : +$18 million to bolster recruitment and retention efforts for public health engineers. F acility and Environmental Health Support funding supports an extensive array of real property, health care facilities and staff quarters construction, maintenance and operation services, as well as community and institutional environmental health, injury prevention, and sanitation facilities construction services. Facilities and Environmental health support funding and staf f at the IHS Headquarters, Area Office, and Service Unit levels work collaboratively with Tribes and other agencies to promote and provide access to improvements in public health through surveillance, education, intervention activities, construction of san itation facilities and health care facilities. The IHS owns over 10.2 million square feet of facilities across 2,119 buildings and 1,758 acres of federal and trust land. The nature of this space varies from sophisticated medical centers to residential units and utility plants. Facilities range in age from less than one year to more than 167 years, with an average age greater than 39 years. A professional and fully - functional workforce is essential to ensure effective and efficient operations. This proposal is intended to increase the number of qualified engineer applicants within the Sanitation Facilities Construction Program. The proposal will support training of engineers over a 3 year period to earn a Master of Science (MS) Degree in Civil o r Environmental Engineering with a focus on developing technical and practical skills in planning, designing, constructing, and assessing the impact of sanitation facilities supporting Native American and Alaska Native homes and communities. The substanti al SFC funding provided in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act underscore the necessity of ensuring IHS has sufficient public health engineering staff to successfully carry out the sanitation facilities construction projects. o The program will be carried out by colleges and/or universities in collaboration with the IHS DSFC. o Funds provided by the IHS will be used to support tuition, books, fees, and stipends for living expenses for a period of up to 3 years (2 year Master program + 1 year field program) for each student. The fellowship recipients must agree to actively seek employment with the IHS DSFC Program at the end of their second year and complete a total of 3 years of service, similar to the IHS Scholarship Program. CJ - 227o T he IHS would award cooperative agreements to up to 4 recipient colleges and/or universities to fund 5 cohorts of students. Each cohort contains 5 students, totaling 100 students trained over the program's duration. Eligible c olleges and universities include those with ABET accredited programs in Civil and Environmental Engineering that have ongoing and longstanding relationships with American Indian and Alaska Natives as demonstrated by the university or college having: A Chapter of Native American Science and Engineering Society (AISES) a national nonprofit organization focused on substantially increasing the representation of Indigenous peoples of North America in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) studies and careers. A Chapter of the Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science dedicated to fostering the success of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans, from college students to professionals, in attaining advanced degrees, careers, and positions of leadership in STEM Prog rams that support the leadership and training of American Indian and Alaska Natives in public health science and engineering. Existing scholarship and fellowship programs that support American Indian and Alaska Natives in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). If actions are not taken to target recruitment efforts to increase the number of engineer staff within the IHS DSFC Program the program will not be able to deliver the services required under the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA ). The federal workforce employed by the SFC program is aging, and the program is at risk of not maintaining an adequate staffing level to support program delivery into the future. In 2018, it was estimated that 50% of the US Public Health Service Comm issioned Corps (CC) Engineer Officers or an estimated 92 engineers employed by the IHS would be eligible for retirement in 3 years. Also, in 2018, over 60% of the IHS CC Engineer Officers held a senior level rank of O -5 or O-6. Additionally, the number of student interns hired through the Commissioned Corp Student Training and Extern Training Program (COSTEP), historically the primary DSFC Program recruitment method, has steadily decreased over the past 10 years. These trends point to a need for a focused effort to strengthen the engineering staff pipeline within the DSFC.

OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND ENGINEERING SUPPORT PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The IHS Office of Environmental Health and Engineering Support activity (OEHE) provides funds for executive management activiti es, personnel, contracts, contractors, and operating costs for the OEHE Headquarters. Personnel have management responsibility for IHS facilities and environmental health programs, provide direct technical services and support to Area personnel, perform management functions and have responsibility for all construction contracting in excess of $150,000. Management activities include: national policy development and implementation budget formulation, project review and approval congressional report preparation quality assurance (e.g., internal control reviews, Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act activities and other oversight) technical assistance (e.g., consultation and training) construction contracting long range planning meetings (with HHS, Tribes, and other federal agencies) recruitment and retention efforts. Typical direct support functions are: Project officers and contracting officer representatives for health care facilities construction projects: reviewing and/or writing technical justification documents, participating in design reviews and site surveys, conducting onsite inspections, and monitoring project funding status. Staff support real property asset management requirements. These actions are to ensure management accountability and the efficient and economic use of federal real property. Staff serving as contracting officer representatives and project officers in support of data systems, cooperative agreements, inter- agency agreements, and community -based projects. In accordance with appropriation committee direction, OEHE staff develop, maintain, and utilize data systems to distribute Facilities Appropriation resources to Area offices for facilities and environmental health activities and construction administration and manag ement, based upon workload and need. Also, technical guidance, information, and training are provided throughout the IHS system in support of the Facilities Appropriation. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS CJ - 230 T he following are activities which focus on the IHS missi on and priorities: review and approval of Program Justification Documents (PJDs) and Program Of Requirements (PORs) announcement and review of Joint Venture and Small Ambulatory projects awarding and monitoring contracts for all aspects of the Facilities Appropriation, including all types of construction contracts and 638 construction project agreements. OEHE coordinating construction, environmental health, and real property activities through the 12 Area Offices to ensure program consistency, to ensure th e most effective use of resources across IHS, and to support field programs through budget preparation and required reporting, thus ensuring the most effective, accountable use of resources to improve access to quality healthcare services. OEHE strengthen s the overall management of IHS by reviewing and approving the planning documents for health care facilities construction projects called PJDs and PORs. OEHE also reviews joint venture and small ambulatory projects which address assessing health care and improving health care delivery. These programs include behavioral health services. These programs include behavioral health services. The OEHE facilities programs integrate strategic planning, performance, and program integrity into the office's daily business practices. One example is the Sanitation Facilities Construction Strategic planning efforts and identification of needs (Strategy 1, \" Improve the transparency and quality of data collected regarding health care service and program outcomes \" from I HS Strategic Plan FY 2019-2023, Objective 2.1: Create quality improvement capability at all levels of the organization ). Implementation of this plan has improved project management, reduced project durations and transformed the data system used by IHS and federal partners to manage sanitation programs in Indian country. Another example is the Environmental Health program strategic visioning and the Ten Essential Environmental Health Services as a framework. Implementation of these initiatives is ongoing.

Direct Federal, P.L. 93-638 Self-Determination Contracts and Self- Governance Compacts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Equipment funds are used for maintenance, upgrades, replacement, and the purchase of new medical equipment systems at Indian Health Service ( IHS) and Tribal healthcare facilities. It directly supports the Agency's priorities of Partnerships and Quality. Accurate clinical diagnosis and effective therapeutic procedures depend in large part on health care prov iders using modern and effective medical equipment/systems to assure the best possible health diagnosis. The IHS and Tribal health programs manage approximately 90,000 devices consisting of laboratory, medical imaging, patient monitoring, pharmacy, and other biomedical, diagnostic, and patient equipment valued at approximately $700 million. With today's medical devices/systems having an average life expectancy of appro ximately six to eight years and rapid technological advancements, medical equipment replacement is a continual process making it necessary to replace worn out equipment or provide equipment with newer technology to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnos is and treatment. To replace the equipment at the end of its six to eight -year life would require approximately $100 million per year. Many of the IHS hospital administrators reported that old or inadequate physical environments challenged their ability to provide quality care and maintain compliance with the Medicare Hospital Conditions of Participation. Further, the administrators reported that maintaining agin g buildings and equipment is a major challenge. O ver one third of all IHS hospitals ' deficiencies have been found to be related to facilities with some failing on infection control criteria and others having malfunctioning exit doors. CJ - 232Equipment Funds Allocation Method In FY 2022, the IHS Equipment funds were allocated in four categories: Tribally -constructed health care facilities, TRANSAM program, Tribal emergency generator, and new and replacement equipment: 1. Tribally -Constructed Health Care Facilities - The IHS provides medical equipment funds to support the initial purchase of equipment for tribally- constructed health care facilities. FY 2022 funds support approximately $5 million for competitive awards to Tribes and Tribal organizations t hat construct new or expand health care facilities space using non - IHS funding sources. Tribes and Tribal organizations will use these funds to serve approximately 500,000 patients with newly purchased medical equipment. 2. TRANSAM Program - Equipment funds may be used to acquire new and like- new excess medical equipment from the Department of Defense (DoD) or other sources through the TRANSAM (i.e., Transfer of DoD Excess Medical and Other Supplies to Native Americans) Program and to procure ambulances for IHS and Tribal emergency medical services programs. 1 FY 2022 appropriations included $500,000 for the TRANSAM Program from the Equipment budget. Under the TRANSAM Program, excess equipment and supplies, at an annual estimated value of $5 million, are acquired for distribution to federal and Tribal sites. 3. Tribal Emergency Generator - The IHS provides medical equipment funds to support the purchase of emergency generators at T ribally -operated health care facilities. FY 2022 funds support approximately $2 million for Tribal Health Programs located in areas impacted by de- energization events. Funding is allocated to the Tribal Health Program using the IHS ISDEAA compact/contract. 4. New and Replacement Equipment - Approximately $23 million will be allocated to IHS and Tribal health care facilities to maintain existing and purchase new medical equipment, including the replacement of existing equipment used in diagnosing illnesses. The funding allocation is formula based. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount 2019 $23,706 ,000 2020 $28,087 ,000 2021 Final $29,087 ,000 2022 Enacted $30,464 ,000 2023 President's Budget $102,018,000 TRIBAL SHARES Equipment funds are subject to tribal shares and are transferred to Tribes when they assume the responsibility for operating the associated programs, functions, services, and activities at a Federal or Tribe healthcare site. 1 The IHS Facilities appropriation limits total expenditures up to $500,000 for equipment purchased through the TRANSAM Program . CJ - 233BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2023 budget submission for Equipment of $102 million is $ 72 million above the FY 2022 Enac ted level. FY 2022 Base Funding of $30 million - Supports Equipment for existing IHS and Tribal facilities. FY 2023 Funding Increase of +$72 million includes Current Services of +$640,000, including: o Inflation +$134,000 to fund inflationary costs of providing health care services. o Population Growth +$506,000 to address the impact of the additional services need arising from the growing AI/AN population. The IHS projects a population growth rate of 1.8 percent in CY 2022 based on state births and deaths data. Equipment: +$71 million for maintenance and upgrades for existing medical equipment, and procurement of new medical equipment to replace units that are at the end of their useable lifecycle at IHS and Tribal healthcare facilities. Facility deficiencies/BEMAR and medical equipment are complex and involve many variables such as accreditation standards, healthcare patient satisfaction, changing healthcare delivery standards, building codes, old building equipment/system, and medical devices/equipment plus telemedicine used by healthcare professionals. Accurate clinical diagnosis and effective therapeutic procedures depend in large part on health care providers using modern and effective medical equipment and sys tems to assure the best possible health diagnosis. IHS and Tribal health programs manage approximately 90,000 devices consisting of laboratory, medical imaging, patient monitoring, pharmacy, and other biomedical, diagnostic, and patient equipment valued at approximately $700 million. Today's medical devices and systems have an average life expectancy of approximately six to eight years. The average six year life cycle combined with rapid technological advancements means that medical equipment replacement is a continuous process that requires the replacement of aging equipment, and equipment that does not meet newer technological standards, to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and treatment. To replace equipment at IHS and Tribal health facilities at the end of its six -year life would require approximately $100 million per year, growing at an approximate 2 percent inflation rate per year. The FY 2023 funding request would be a substantial investment toward addressing critical equipment needs. Along with aging buildings, aging equipment presents challenges for maintaining accreditation, providing high quality care and ensuring patient safety. It also affects the recruitment and retention of high quality health care professionals. Having access to mo dern equipment and the ability to maintain skills and training on particular devices or equipment are important factors in our providers' decisions about working for IHS. CJ - 234The total $ 102 million funding request for FY 2023 would support: Approximately $94.5 million for new and routine replacement medical equipment to over 1,500 federally and tribally- operated healthcare facilities; $5 million for new medical equipment in tribally -constructed health care facilities; $2 million for emergency generators at Tribal Health Programs located in areas impacted by de- energization events; and $500,000 for the TRANSAM program. OUTPUT S / OUTCOME S This program measures outcomes through its inventory of medical equipment. Maintaining and fielding modern medical equipment improve the ease and access to care, enhance the diagnostic capabilities leading to better health outcomes, and enable the hiring and retention of healthcare professionals by giving them modern space and equipment with which t o deliver services. IHS targets Equipment funding and supplements these funds with collections where available, toward equipment purcha ses to reduce the backlog of over -age equipment and field new, state-of- the-art equipment and systems. A few examples of these purchases include: d igital x -ray systems (dental , 3D panoramic ray, full radiology rooms, 3D mammography, computed tomography), optometry equipment (visual simultaneous optical coherence tomography), lab analyzer s for in-house testing, sterilization equipment, specialized microscopes, patient lifting equipment, picture archiving & communications system s (PACS) , central patient monitoring systems, and ultrasound systems. This equipment will improve diagnostic capabilities, provide faster analysis, and facilitate provision of services to American Indian and Alaska Native communities .

P.L. 93-638 Self-Determination Contracts and Compacts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA), Public Law 93-638, provides Tribes or Tribal Organizations (T/TO) the authority to contract with the Department of Health and Human Services, through the Indian Health Service (IHS), to operate Federal programs serving eligible persons and to receive not less than the amount of funding that the Secretary would have otherwise provided for the direct operation of the program for the period covered by the contract (otherwise known as the \"Sec retarial amount\"). The 1988 amendments to the Act authorized Contract Support Costs (CSC) be paid in addition to the Secretarial amount. Strategic Goal 1: Protect and Strengthen Equitable Access to High Quality and Affordable Healthcare, Objective 1.5: Bo lster the health workforce to ensure delivery of quality services and care CSC are defined as necessary and reasonable costs for activities that T/TO must carry out to ensure compliance with the contract and prudent management but that the Secretary eithe r did not normally carry out in his or her direct operation of the program or provided from resources other than those transferred under contract. The IHS CSC policy was established in 1992 and most recently revised on August 6, 2019, which updates from the October 2016 policy revisions, 1 an update to reflect necessary changes. These changes include the method by which Congress has funded CSC, and moves from limited to uncapped awards, and the provision of CSC to an indefinite appropriation. Goal 5: Adv ance Strategic Management to Build Trust, Transparency, and Accountability, Objective 5.1: Promote effective enterprise governance to ensure programmatic goals are met equitably and transparently across all management practices and Objective 5.2: Sustain s trong financial stewardship of HHS resources to foster prudent use of 1 Indian Health Manual , Part 6 - Services to Tribal Governments and Organizations, Chapter 3 - Contract Support Costs, available at http://www.ihs.gov/ihm/index.cfm?module=dsp_ihm_pc_p6c3 . CJ - 236resources, accountability, and public trust. CSC is administered for IHS by the Office of Direct Services and Contracting Tribes (ODSCT), an office with responsibility for three primary functions that directly impact the relationship with each Indian T/TO. The ODSCT serves as the primary conduit between the IHS and the Direct Service Tribes, management of P.L. 93 -638 Title I, ISDEAA contracts, and CSC in support of both Title I contract s and Title V compacts. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS Following is a summary CSC funds for FY 2016 - FY 202 1, as of August 13, 2021: FY 201 6 FY 201 7 ($264,212,845) * Funds remain in process for payment to tribes and/or pending final reconciliation with tribes to determine the final amounts. IHS developed a SharePoint to track CSC requirements for COVID -19 funds. S eparate data set are maintained for the period of funds availability for each Supplemental Appropriation. IHS SP Goal 5, Objective 5.1 and 5.2. IHS Headquarters reconciles CSC fund requests on a quarterly basis and allocates funds to each Area office to pay tribes. IHS SP Goal 1, Objective 1.5, Goal 5, Objective 5.1 and 5.2. IHS uses the CSC automated data system to track and monitor all CSC activity. The CSC data set is used to track all CSC funds, including any new and expanded assumption, renegotiation of CSC amounts, and distribution and payment of funds. IHS also uses the system to project CSC need based on the most current data. IHS SP , Goal 5, Objective 5.1 and 5.2. IHS continues to use the internal electronic database to monitor each Title I and V ISDEAA negotiation, including CSC negotiations. The database monitors each phase of a negotiation to ensure that IHS uses a consistent agency business approach, meet statutory deadlines, and accurately calculate required funding amounts. In addition, the database tracks new and expanded assumptions and is used to determine the status of funds, workload, planning of resources, and subsequent years' funding needs. IHS SP , Goal 5, Objective 5.1 and 5.2. IHS continues to make progress in resolving Contract Disputes Act claims from T/TO for additional CSC funding for prior years. As of August 17, 2020, the IHS has extended settlement offers on 1,567 of the 1,624 claims, with settlement payments of approximately $880 million that has been tentative or confirmed for payment from the Judgment Fund.

Authorizing Legislation ................................................................................... 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5324( l) Indian Self- Determination Assistance Act, P.L. 93- 638, as amended FY 20 Method .................................. P.L. 93-638 Self-Determination Contract and Compacts, Lease Cost Agreements PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act ( ISDEAA), at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5324( l), also referred to as Section 105( l), requires the Indian Health Service (I HS) to enter a \"lease\" upon the request of a Tribe or Tribal Organization furnishing a tribally owned or leased facility used in support of its tribally operated ISDEAA contract or compact. IHS does not directly use or occupy the tribal facility under the lease. Through regulations contained in 25 C.F.R. Part 900, Subpart H, IHS identified elements of compensation included in a Section 105( l) lease. A 2016 Federal Court's decision (Maniilaq Association v. Burwell) prohibits IHS from capping funding under Section 105( l) at the level that IHS would have otherwise spent to operate a facility if it were to carrying out the Federal health programs. There is no statutory or regulatory limitation on when proposals may be submitted to the IHS, so IHS is unable to reliably predict or project annual costs. Lease costs have grown exponentially, since the Manii laq decision, and quadrupled between FY 2018 and FY 2019. Because IHS has not ha d sufficient dedicated funding for leases, IHS has been forced to reprogram funds twice in FY 2019 totaling $62 million and once in FY 2018 totaling $25 million. A funding incr ease in FY 2020 temporarily reduced the likelihood of reprogramming . , This changed in FY 2021 where Congress added appropriation language essentially authorizing full funding to cover all FY 2021 105(l) lease costs. This language continued in FY 2022 and is expected to continue going forward. The prevalence of Section 105( l) leases in FY 2017 was largely confined to the Alaska Area. However, by FY 2020, leases have proliferated throughout the IHS system and proposals have been received in all 12 IHS Areas. This new, separate funding source supports IHS Strategic Plan goals and objectives for increasing access to care by establishing a dedicated funding source for these required costs and preventing the redirection of other IHS funds intended for health care services ( Goal 1, Access, Objective 1.3, Increase access to quality health care services ). CJ - 239PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS IHS has received 422 proposals in FY 2022 to date, with a current total of $176.8 million. This amount is likely to increase before the end of the fiscal year. At this funding level, costs are 29 times higher than in FY 2017. Based on the exponential growth of Section 105( l) leases from 37 proposals totaling $6 million in FY 2017, to 76 proposals totaling $21 million in FY 2018, to 189 proposals totaling $85 million in FY 2019, and 296 proposals totaling $123 million in FY 2020, costs for future years are expected to continue growing as more Tribes and Tribal Organizations submit additional proposals. In FY 2021, the IHS received an indefinite discretionary appropriation for section 105( l) leases, scored at $101 million. Funding for Village Built Clinics (VBCs) remains in the Hospitals and Health Clinics funding line. Unlike in prior years when section 105( l) lease costs were paid from the IHS lump sum appropriation for the Indian Health Services account, the IHS will not have to reallocate funding from other budget lines to address unanticipated lease proposals. The IHS conducted Tribal Consultation and Urban Confer in FY 2018 and again in FY 2019 on short-term and long-term options for meeting requirements of the ISDEAA related to Section 105( l). Tribal and Urban Indian Organization feedback strongly recommended seeking additional resources, such as through a separat e indefinite appropriation, and remained critical of any redirection of existing funding, which diminishes the Indian health system's ability to provide direct health care services. At the recommendation of Tribes and Tribal Organizations, the IHS establi shed a technical subgroup to help collect and analyze information necessary for developing cost projections. The subgroup includes representatives from the IHS Tribal Self -Governance Advisory Committee, the IHS Direct Services Tribes Advisory Committee, the IHS Facilities Appropriation Advisory Board, the IHS National Tribal Budget Formulation Workgroup (NTBFW), and subject matter experts from the IHS. This subgroup operates under the auspices of the NTBFW and their on -going work is included in the IHS's annual Tribal Consultation and Urban Confer on the budget. In accordance with Congress's direction in the FY 2021 annual appropriation, the IHS partnered with the Department of Interior on an ini tial consultation regarding the development of a section 105(l) policy on August 27, 2021. The IHS and DOI continue to work together to review comments from that consultation to identify topics for additional consultation, and areas for collaboration. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount 2019 $0 2020 $0 2021 REQUEST The FY 2023 budget submission for ISDEAA Section 105( l) leases of $150 million is the same as the FY 2022 Enacted level. The budget request includes a mandatory indefinite appropriation for ISDEAA Section 105 (l) leases. The overall funding level varies with need that is adjusted to meet the actual need for each fiscal year, which means that the appropriated amount will continue to fluctuate until the leases need is fully reconciled for each year. The requested funding level reflects IHS's best current estimate of the need. OUTPUTS / OUTCOMES -- There are no outputs/outcomes for this funding at this time. GRANTS AWARDS -- The program does not award grants. AREA ALLOCATION - Funds are allocated to Areas as ISDEAA Section 105( l) lease proposals are received and executed each fiscal year .

This determination was made in consultation with ONDCP when the drug control budget was initially developed in the early - 1990s.FY 2022 EnactedBudget Authority (in Millions) M ISSION The Indian Health Service (IHS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, is responsible for providing Federal health services to American Indian and Alaska CJ - 242Na tive (AI/AN) people. IHS supports substance abuse treatment and prevention services as part of this mission. METHODOLOGY The IHS includes the appropriation for Alcohol and Substance Abuse (excluding the amount designated as Adult Alcohol Treatment) and the portion of Urban Indian Health funds that partially come from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism programs transferred to the IHS under the U rban Indian Health budget. BUDGET SUMMARY In FY 2023, IHS requests $344.7 million whi ch is an increase of $ 86.3 million over the FY 2022 Enacted level for its drug control activities . Alcohol and Substance Abuse FY 20 23 Request : $344.7 million In FY 2023, the IHS budget request for its drug control activities supports the O ffice of National Drug Control and P olicy (ONDCP) funding priorities as well as the ONDCP Strategy . The Strategy emphasizes the partnership between Federal agencies and their state, local, tribal, and international counterparts and reduce drug-induced mortality. IHS is also working with Federal partners to implement ONDCP's efforts to address the current opioid crisis and reduce the number of American's dying from dangerous drugs. The Administration's ONDCP Strategy guides and expands Federal government efforts to : 1) expand access to evidence- based treatment ; 2) advancing racial equity issues in our approach to drug policy; 3) enhancing evidence -based harm reduction efforts; 4) supporting evidence -based prevention efforts to reduce youth substance use; 5) reducing the supply of illicit substances ; 6) advancing recovery -ready workplaces and expanding the addiction workforce; and , 7) expanding access to recovery support services. The Strategy offers a valuable opportunity for IHS to advance its mission by strengthening existing programs to control and reduce substance use and eliminate its deleterious effects on the health and safety of AI/AN patients and communities. The IHS Alcohol and Substance Abuse program serves AI/ANs impacted by substance use disorders through IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian operated treatment and prevention programs and Youth Regional Treatment Centers (YRTCs). The IHS established a multi-disciplinary workgroup to form the IHS National Committee on Heroin, Opioids, and Pain Efforts (HOPE). The HOPE Committee is comprised of a multidisciplinary membership to include clinical representation from family medicine, pharmacy, behavioral health, nursing, pediatrics, physical therapy, epidemiology, and injury prevention. The HOPE Committee work plan supports the HHS 5-Point Strategy to Combat the Opioid Crisis with a specific focus on: 1) better pain management; 2) improving access to culturally relevant prevention, treatment, and recovery support services; 3) increasing availability and distribution of opioid overdose reversing drugs; and, 4) improved public health data reporting and surveillance. In addition to direct services, the IHS Alcohol and Substance Abuse grant and federal award program supports the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2.2 to provide care to better meet the health care needs of AI/AN communities and Goal 1 to ensure comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN people. CJ - 243P articularly , in the prevention, treatment , and recovery of alcohol and substance use disorders (SUD) . The IHS Division of Behavioral Health administers community- based grants that promote the use and development of evidence- based and practice- based models that represent culturally - appropriate prevention and treatment approaches to substance mis use from a community-driven context. In particular, the IHS Opioid Grant Program and the Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention program will support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1, Objective 1.2 to build, strengthen, and sustain collaborative relationships and Objective 1.3 to increase access to quality health care services. Expanding Access to Evidence- B ased Treatment : Increasing Access to MAT Services: In June 2019, IHS released the Special General Memorandum Assuring Access to MAT that requires federal IHS facilities create an action plan to identify or create local medication assisted treatment resources and coordinate patient access to these services when indicated.1 Key components of these approaches include enhanced screening and early identification of Opioid Use Disorders; improved care coordination and patient referral for treatment; and workforce development strategies to increase education and resources surrounding using medications in the support of recovery. In addition, the IHS created workforce development strategies that include SUD training for healthcare workers and technical assistance materials to support sites with creating integrated SUD approaches to care. The IHS does face challenges in providing MAT in certain sectors within Indian Country. The rural and frontier nature of where AI/ANs live creates barriers to accessing health facilities. This is especially evident in Alaska where patients often only have access to a community health aide serving within a village -based clinic, hours away by plane and from a larger health center. Additionally, IHS has felt the impact of a declining supply of specific health professionals who could support the IHS workforce and address behavioral health needs. The IHS recognizes that telemedicine is one tool for increasing access to specialized medical services, such as MAT. The IHS has published a policy in the Indian Health Manual (Chapter 38) entitled Internet Eligible Controlled Substance Prescriber Designation to assure access to MAT using telemedicine models for remot ely located Tribal members.2 In December 2019, the IHS processed the first tribal clinician application to receive this designation. IHS Opioid Grant Program: In FY 2021, IHS awarded a total of $16 Million in grants to combat the opioid crisis. IHS awarded thirty -five grants under the Community Opioid Intervention Pilot Project (COIPP) for AI/ANs targeted at opioid specific activities. These grants support the development of innovative, locally -designed, culturally- appropriate prevention, treatment, recovery, and aftercare services for opioid use disorders . The projects will focus on increasing public awareness and education about the impact of OUD on individuals, families and communitie s; and create comprehensive support teams to strengthen and empower families addressing the opioid crisis. Finally, all projects will prioritize efforts to reduce unmet needs and opioid overdose deaths through increased access to MAT. The IHS COIPP is a t hree-year program and part of the Department of Health and Human Services' five- point strategy to fight the opioid overdose and Suicide Prevention (SASP) : The SASP is a nationally -coordinated grant program (formerl y referred to as the Methamphetamine and Suicide Prevention Initiative (MSPI) ) which focuses on substance abuse and suicide prevention providing intervention resources targeted to Tribes, Tribal programs, and Urban Indian communities with the greatest need for these programs. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of the 174 SASP projects reduced and/or ceased activities. Only a limited number of projects continued to operate and did so according to their local, state, and federal guidelines for COVID -19 by modifying in-person activities to virtual events. In June 2020, the IHS requested and received a 1- year extension for all SASP grants from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) due to the impact of COVID -19. The new end date for all SA SP grants was September 29, 2021. The goals of the current SASP program are to: 1. Increase IHS, Tribal, and Urban (I/T/U) capacity to operate successful substance abuse prevention, treatment, and aftercare and/or suicide prevention, intervention, and postvention services through implementing community and organizational needs assessment and strategic plans; 2. Develop and foster data sharing systems among I/T/U behavioral health service providers to demonstrate efficacy and impact; 3. Identify and address suicid e ideations, attempts, and contagions among AI/AN populations through the development and implementation of culturally appropriate and community relevant prevention, intervention, and postvention strategies; 4. Identify and address substance use among AI/AN populations through the development and implementation of culturally appropriate and community relevant prevention, treatment, and aftercare strategies; 5. Increase provider and community education on suicide and substance use by offering appropriate trainings; and 6. Promote positive AI/AN youth development and family engagement through the implementation of early intervention strategies to reduce risk factors for suicidal behavior and substance use. SASP projects were awarded funding in at leas t one of four purpose areas and work to address the corresponding SASP goal listed above. SASP Purpose Areas are: 1. Community Needs Assessment and Strategic Planning; 2. Suicide Prevention, Intervention, and Postvention; 3. Substance Use Prevention, Treatment, an d Aftercare; and 4. Generation Indigenous (Gen- I) Initiative Support. All projects funded have a training objective to increase and expand the types of healthcare providers trained in SUD screening, assessment or treatment, including Brief Intervention and Motivational Interviewing. Projects also seek to hire additional behavioral health staff (i.e., licensed behavioral health providers and paraprofessionals, including but not limited to peer specialists, mental health technicians, and community health aides) specializing in child, adolescent, and family services. These new staff will be responsible for implementing project activities that address all of the required objectives listed . As with other IHS Behavioral Health Initiatives, these funded projects su pport ONDCP's efforts to advance recovery -ready workplaces and expanding the addiction workforce. Successful outcomes during the fourth year of the program include expanded behavioral health services offered through school settings and home visiting with a total of 1,475 patients receiving care. Over 270 providers were trained in behavioral health integration with 163 of those CJ - 245p roviders located within a primary care setting. Project accomplishments include 67,168 individuals screen for suicide ideation, 54 percent of the SASP program suicide prevention projects implemented an enhanced process for suicide screening, and over 11,003 community members have been trained in suicide and/or substance use prevention. Fifty -three percent of projects hosted a successful prevention education community event. Twenty -nine percent reported implementation and documentation of a system change. In addition, among proje cts supported, a total of 76,054 individuals received cultural services, a high percentage of projects have continued to offer integrated traditional healing into care, extended service hours, provision of follow- up care, new counseling and case management services. In summary, the SASP program continues to support tribes, tribal organizations, urban Indi an organizations (UIOs) , and federal facilities offering care. Preventing Alcohol -Related Deaths (PARD ): In the 2017 Senate Appropriations Committee Report 114-281, the Committee directed IHS to \"allocate $2,000,000 of the increase provided for the alcohol and substance abuse program to fund essential detoxification and related services.\" Specifically, in the report the number of alcohol related deaths in the community of Gallup, New Mexico was addressed with the report stating, \"these deaths underscore the urgent need for substance abuse treatment, residential services and detoxification services\" in this community. In response, the IHS used the increased appropriated funds to address the urgent need in the city of Gallup, New Mexico. In addition to Gallup, New Mexico, IHS was aware of the urgent need for alcohol detoxification services in the Great Plains Area after the removal of liquor licenses and alcohol sales in White Clay, Nebraska, leading to the potential for increased mortality if services were unavailable for alcohol detoxification. As a result, funds were also made available to address this urgent need. The funds provided to Gallup, New Mexico and the Great Plains Area (specifically the Oglala Sioux Tribe) to address the need for socia l detox ification services were made available in FY 2017 through a competitive cooperative agreement. The funding announcement was released in FY 2017 and two projects were selected and funded. The project period is for five years and will run from Septe mber 15, 2017, to September 14, 2022. With the additional funding, the Gallup NM site reported detoxification services to 9,482 unique individuals with over 75 percent of those clients including males. In addition to services offered for monitoring, supervising and managing detoxification, this site has increased coordination and transportation with the Emergency Department; and establish ed a contract with the Gallup Police Department to transport patients to the detoxification center. The Great Plains' site has used the funding to increase coordination with behavioral health programs, provide screenings and brief interventions to individuals incarcerated in jails, and serve as an immediate placement for individuals who are in need of treatment services following detoxification. In FY 2020, nearly 100 percent of individuals held in detoxification for more than two weeks were successfully admitted into a higher level of residential treatment care for their SUD. During the COVID- 19 pandemic, services wer e temporarily interrupted at the City of Gallup detoxification site, and the Great Plains Area PARD site. IHS continues to work with both sites to ensure each has adopted guidelines provided by the local and state health departments, and the CDC for conti nued operations for detoxification programs. Supporting Evidence- B ased Prevention Efforts to Reduce Youth Substance Use: IHS SASP - Generation Indigenous (Gen -I): Of the 174 SASP projects funded, 19 projects specifically focus on substance use prevention, treatment, and aftercare, while 107 focus on substance use and suicide prevention among Native youth. IHS established the Universal Alcohol Screening (UAS) as a national measure to increase screening and improve detection and intervention strategies among patients' ages 9 through 75 years of age. In FY 2021, 31.1 percent CJ - 246o f eligible patients were screened for risky alcohol use, which is less than the IHS target of 39.0 percent. Youth Regional Treatment Centers: The IHS YRTCs provide residential substance abuse and mental health treatment services to AI/AN youth. Congress established these YRTCs in each of the 12 IHS Areas, with two (northern and southern) specifically authoriz ed for the California Area. The YRTC in Northern California is expected to be operational in early 2021. The 12 currently funded YRTCs provide quality holistic behavioral health care for AI/AN adolescents that integrate traditional healing, spiritual valu es, and cultural identification. In FY 2021, all federal YRTCs in operation 18 months or longer have achieved and maintained accreditation status. In response to the challenges YRTCs experienced to maintain facility operations, YRTCs partnered with the IHS, SAMHSA's Office of Tribal Affairs and Policy and the Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) Network Coordinating Office to identify and develop response and recovery resources specific to YRTCs continuity of care. The document \"Guidance for Carin g for Patients in Youth Regional Treatment Centers During the COVID -19 Pandemic\" was developed to support the delivery of care among the YRTCs during this ever- evolving situation. 3 YRTC Aftercare Pilot Project: Two YRTC facilities, Desert Sage and the Healing Lodge of the 7 Nations are in the last year of an IHS supported aftercare pilot project. YRTCs have an important role in maintaining the health of patients after discharge. This aftercare pilot emphasizes developing culture -based treatment t hat prevents alcohol and substance abuse relapse among youth discharged. While evaluations are in place, current data indicates that these programs have resulted in improved coordination around aftercare and case management, increased training of community supports for the adolescents, improved identification of transitional living, increased awareness of the use of social media, and improved follow -up with data collection after discharge. This pilot program will continue to support the YRTC's ability to support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 to ensure comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Native people. The YRTC Aftercare Pilot Project supports the Strategy's efforts to expand access to recovery support. Particularly, in the recovery from alcohol and substance use disorders. The DOI through the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), and the IHS ha ve a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) on Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse Prevention, which was amended in 2011 as a result of the permanent reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Through this MOA, BIA, BIE, and IHS coordinate and impleme nt plans in cooperation with T ribes to assist Tribal governments in their efforts to address behavioral health issues. The MOA includes coordination of data collection, resources, and programs of IHS, BIA, and BIE. The Tribal Law and Order Act (TLOA) r equires interagency coordination and collaboration among HHS (IHS and SAMHSA), DOI (BIA/BIE), DOJ (Office of Justice Programs/Office of Tribal Justice), and the Office of the Attorney General. The coordination of Federal efforts and resources will assist in determining both the scope of alcohol and substance abuse problems as well as effective prevention and treatment programs. The MOA required by Section 241 of the TLOA was signed on July 29, 2011, by the Secretaries of the Departments of Health and Human Services , the Interior and the Attorney General to: (1) determine the scope of the alcohol and substance abuse problems faced by Tribes; (2) identify and delineate the resources each entity can 3 https://attcnetwork.org/sites/default/files/2020 -08/YRTC_Document_08_05_20.pdf CJ - 247br ing to bear on the problem; (3) set standards for applying those resources to the problems; and (4) coordinate existing agency programs. Enhancing Evidence- B ased Harm Reduction Efforts : The IHS has expanded access to harm reduction interventions that include increased access to the opioid overdose reversal medi cation, naloxone. Since 2015, the IHS has maintained an ongoing collaboration with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to train and provide naloxone to BIA Law Enforcement Officers (LEO) for responding to opioid overdoses. These initial efforts have evolved into a robust harm reduction strategy that includes a combination of policy and workforce development efforts. In March 2018, the IHS implemented a policy in the Indian Health Manual (Chapter 35) entitled Prescribing and Dispensing of Naloxone to Firs t Responders to require IHS f ederal pharmacies to provide naloxone to Tribal law enforcement agencies and other trained first responders. A revision to Chapter 35 was released in 2020 to further expand first responder definitions to community members and to reduce administrative reporting requirements related to requests for resupply. The IHS has also created a naloxone toolkit for tribal c ommunities that includes a culturally responsive training video and a digital story from two LEOs involved in a naloxone 'save'. This toolkit also contains a train the trainer curriculum and standardized forms to support first responder initiatives. The IHS has also created sample protocols and pharmacist collaborative practice agreements to expand access to co -prescribed naloxone for patients on long-term opioid therapy or at increased risk for opioid overdose. In November 2019, the IHS developed and released a health education video that shared best and promising practices surrounding naloxone distribution and the way IHS and the Red Lake Nation are responding to the opioid crisis. A companion video was released in August 2020 that shares basic information related to opioids, naloxone, treatment and prevention. The IHS has further adapted the toolkit and strategy to equip community first responders and paraprofessionals with training on opioid overdose response and naloxone. These expanded collaborations with local law enforcement and community first responders resulted in an initial pilot community -health naloxone train-the-trainer program to include naloxone distribution. In August 2019, ninety -six community-health workers completed training as naloxone trainers for their tribal communities in one week. In FY 2018, buprenorphine and suboxone were added to the IHS Core Formulary. Buprenorphine and suboxone are common medications used to treat opioid use disorder. With these added to the Core Formulary, all IHS facilities with pharmacies have these medication s readily available for their patients. Data related to buprenorphine and suboxone will be captured in reporting tools that will support regional -level efforts to better monitor MAT and SUD treatment across IHS. The strategic goal is to support Tribal programs and UIOs in their continued substance abuse prevention, treatment, and infrastructure development. These efforts represent an innovative partnership with IHS to deliver services developed by the communities themselves, with a national support network for ongoing program development and evaluation. Substance use disorders continue to rank high on the concern list of Tribal partners. IHS believes that a shift in emphasis to earlier intervention is required to be successful in reducing the conseque nces of substance use disorders. IHS proposes focusing on early intervention with adolescents and young adults and preventing further progression by recognizing and responding to the source of the abuse. CJ - 248I HS continues to support the integration of subst ance use disorder treatment into primary care and emergency services through its activities to implement the Strategy . Integrating treatment services into outpatient primary care offers opportunities for healthcare providers to identify patients with substance use disorders, provide them with medical advice, help them understand the health risks and consequences, and refer patients with more severe substance use- related problems to treatment.4 One integration activity is Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT), which is an early intervention and treatment service for people with substance use disorders and those at risk of developing these disorders. IHS has increased efforts to implement the SBIRT across IHS facilities as an ev idence- based practice to identify patients with alcohol related problems. The SBIRT is a Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) measure that IHS reports annually. In FY 20 21, the SBIRT was administered at 14.3 percent for AI/AN ages 9 -75, exceeding the targ et of 15.8 percent screened . IHS promotes the use of this clinical process by training providers in clinical and community settings. IHS currently offers 10 SBIRT on-demand trainings. SBIRT is intended to meet the public health goal of reducing the harms and societal costs associated with risky use by reducing diseases, accidents, and injuries. As an additional resource, IHS developed an Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program webpage: htt ps://www.ihs.gov/asap/providers/sbirt/ . The IHS requires all prescribers to conduct a full patient m edical history and physical examination including review of the patient's current psychosocial status, any history of mental health or substance abuse concerns, and assessment for relevant signs of misuse or abuse of substances. Examination is done at the time of consideration of use of chronic opioid therapy and periodically during active pain management treatment. Patient screening surveys and urine drug tests are helpful in determining the risk of opioid misuse and guiding the frequency of ongoing monitoring. Screening surveys are incorporated into the triage/nurse screening process prior to seeing the clinician. IHS developed a Pain Management webs ite: https://www.ihs.gov/painmanagement/substancescreening/. Patients treated for SUD often present with a need to address co -occurring mental disorders. In FY 2017, the IHS Division of Behavioral Health awarded 12 new grantees through the Behavioral Health Integration Initiative (BH2I), a nationally-coordinated grant program that provides funding to Tribes, Tribal organizations, UIOs and federal facilities to plan, develop, implement and evaluate behavioral health integration with primary care. A primary goal of the BH2I is to formalize integration across the system, develop care teams, strengthen infrastructure, and enhance clinical processes including increased depression screenings in primary care clinics. Additionally, IHS contracted with a technical assistance (TA) provider to guide this pilot project through the implementation of their integrated care efforts with expertise from psychiatrists, primary care physicians, and social workers. Thus far, BH2I projects have reported successes such as new behavioral health integration policies and procedures including same day access to behavioral health providers within primary care and emergency room settings. Sites have also reported increased screening rates for depression, anxiety, trauma and early childhood development disabilities and reduction in wait times to see a mental health counselor and psychiatrist. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, these efforts were extended into F Y 2021, providing additional time in the project period to complete proposed activities with a focus on meeting the needs of the community and developing sustainability plans. 4 ONDCP. Integrating Treatment into Healthcare. Available at http://w award approximately 15 new BH2I grantees on a five- year funding cycle. Additionally, IHS will contract with a technical assistance provider to assist grantees with the implementation of integrated care efforts. While screenings remain critical to ensure that appropriate health services are available to AI/AN population, IHS acknowledges the importance of understanding a patient's life experiences in order to deliver effective care and improving treatment adherence. In FY 2020, IHS rel eased a trauma informed care policy to provide guidance to Indian Health Service facilities to improve patient engagement and improve health outcomes as well as supporting provider and staff wellness. IHS continues to implement the principles of trauma informed care to ensure its system understands the prevalence and role of trauma in patient care. In FY 2021, IHS released 13 Trauma Informed Care on- demand trainings which included 211 attendees. These efforts ensure comprehensive, culturally appropriate s ervices are provided and support the Strategy's priority to advance racial equity issues in our approach to drug policy. In FY 2022, IHS will support the new trauma informed care policy by developing on-demand online training for clinical and non- clinical staff. This training will provide guidance to IHS facilities in delivering trauma -informed care services along with promoting self- care to prevent secondary traumatic stress, which can lead to compassion fatigue and burnout. Reducing the Supply of Illicit Substance: Increase Mandatory Prescriber Education and Continuing Training on Best Practices and Current Clinical Guidelines: The IHS implemented the \"Chronic Non- Cancer Pain Management Policy\" to promote appropriate pain management as a primary prevention tool. In February 2018, IHS released a revised policy to include clinical practice guidelines contained in the 2016 CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. This revised policy adopts CDC guidance and spe cifically requires IHS sites to establish and implement local chronic non -cancer pain protocols and procedures; requires prescribers to complete training on appropriate and effective use of controlled substance medications; and establishes the requirement to initiate opioid treatment as a shared decision between the prescriber and the patient to respect and support the patient's right to optimal pain assessment and management. Substance Use Disorder and Chronic Pain Case Consultation Services: T o provid e ongoing clinical support for providers, IHS, in partnership with the University of New Mexico Pain Center, provided a Substance Use Disorder and Chronic Pain ECHO. ECHO is a case- based learning model in which consultation is offered through virtual clinics to healthcare providers by an expert team to share knowledge and elevate the level of specialty care available to patients. In FY 2021, a total of 20 ECHO sessions were offered with over 748 attendees. In May 2019, the IHS released its \" Recommendations for Management of Acute Dental Pain\" for prescribing opioids for acute pain secondary to common general dentistry conditions and procedures. These g uideline limit opioid prescribing for patients who cannot safely use alternative pain medication. The guidelines also include a decision tree for pre- and post-operative pain management, as well as recommended dosage limits for analgesics based on the degree of anticipated operative pain. The IHS collaborated to create content for a five- part CEU webinar series to influence dental prescribing practices and enhance screening for substance use disorders in general dentistry. The IHS has also implemented IHM Chapter 32 \"State Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs\" that establishes policy requirement for Fed eral facilities to participate with state -based CJ - 250P rescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP). Controlled substance prescribers working in IHS federal -government -operated must query state PDMP databases prior to prescribing opioids for pain treatment longer than seven days and periodically throughout chronic pain treatment. I n FY 2019, IHS developed and released software programming to automate controlled substance dispensing reports to state- based PDMPs to near real -time reporting to improve the fidelity of IHS dispensing data in state PDMP databases. The IHS has been in preliminary planning and design discussions to evaluate feasibility of PDMP interoperability and integration into the IHS Electronic Health Record. These efforts support the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 3, Objective 3.3 Modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decisions. In March 2019, the IHS released the Recommendations to the Indian Health Service on American Indian/Alaska Native Pregnant Women and Women of Childbearing Age with Opioid Use Disorder developed in collaboration with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' (ACOG) Committee on American Indian and Alaska Native Women's Health. 5 This resource will help providers improve maternal participation in early prenatal care, improve screening for substance use disorder, and increase access to MAT for pregnant women and women of child- bearing age. The goal of these clinical recommendations is to foster relationships and improve awareness surrounding trauma-informed approaches to maternal opioid use that may lead to recovery, hope, and healing. Additionally, the IHS and the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Native American Child Health (CONACH) recently released the Recommendations to the Indian Health Service on Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome that includes clinical recommendations on the prevention and management of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome.6 These recommendations provide standards of care for screening, diagnosing, support, and treatment of pregnant mothers and infants affected by prenatal opioid exposure. In August 2019, the IHS developed and released two additional Clinical Reporting System measures to track implementation of the ACOG recommendations and substance use disorder screening in women of childbearing age. P roper Pain Management and Opioid Stewardship Training: The IHS has created and released a comprehensive Opioid Stewardship workbook to assist sites with creating best practices surrounding safe opioid prescribing recommendations and increasing access to integrative pain treatments. The workbook emphasizes utilizing opioid surveillance strategies to evaluate population health outcomes, target opioid interventions, enhance clinical decision support, and create professional practice evaluation strategies. In August 2022, IHS completed data definitions to support creation of an opioid prescribing surveillance dashboard that will assist with the analysis of opioid- related data at the local and regional levels. The IHS opioid stewardship program evaluation considers metrics that evaluate trends in Morphine Milligram Equivalents versus a restricted focus on total opioid prescription fills, include analysis of risk reduction strategies with co-prescribed naloxone, and monitor patient conversion to chronic opioid therapy. These efforts supp ort the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 3, Objective 3.3 Modernize information technology and information systems to support data driven decisions. The IHS has also recently facilitated dedicated access to tele- consultation services for IHS clinicians to re ceive on -demand substance use expert recommend ations and tailored clinical guidance for IHS healthcare providers of all experience levels. This service is also av ailable to assist IHS health systems with creating clinic policies and procedures to support creation of integrated MAT services in IHS facilities. 5 https://www.ihs.gov/sites/opioids/themes/responsive2017/display_objects/documents/acogguidelines2018.pdf 6 https://www.ihs.gov/sites/opioids/themes/responsive2017/display_objects/documents/aap nowsrecommendationstoihs.pdf CJ - 251 I n May 2016, the IHS implemented a policy on mandatory opioid training requiring all federally controlled substance prescribers to complete the \"IHS Essential Training on Pain and Addiction\" with r equired refresher training every 3 years. This training is now available on demand with continuing education credits. The IHS released its Refresher training course in January 2018, including four sessions of its mandatory five-hour training course for providers on proper opioid prescribing. In FY 2021, 276 new clinicians completed this course. The mandate also includes an additional refresher training after three years. In FY 20 21, 327 participants completed the Essential Training on Pain and Addiction Refresher course. This course will be updated in FY 2021. The IHS has also created a robust workforce development strategy to include didactic training. In September 2019, the IHS launched its Pain Management and Opioid Use Disorder Continuing Medical E ducation series. The IHS has hosted learning sessions in this series that include buprenorphine prescribing in pregnancy as well as a live instructor-led auricular acupuncture-training program, implementation of MAT programs, management of co-occurring dis orders, and initiating Buprenorphine in the acute care setting. Future session include an intensive training program related to the management of substance use disorders for advanced practice pharmacists and additional content surrounding integrated MAT m odels. In FY 2021, IHS provided three webinars that addressed pain management, opioids, and opioid misuse with a total of 179 attendees. Treatment of OUD in the ED, Should it be a Choice? Opioid Management in Primary Care: An Integrated Approach Novel Buprenorphine Induction Strategies Enhanced communication during the opioid crisis response is vital to program development, policy implementation, and ongoing evaluation. The IHS created an Opioid Information Sheet that serve s as a public- facing logic m odel to share opioid- related measure, agency goals, and available resources for both clinicians and tribal stakeholders. The IHS opioid strategy and a host of available resources is housed on two IHS webpages that support a unified user experience in addition to publication of a quarterly opioid newsletter. The IHS collaborated in FY 2018 with the CDC to participate in the CDC Opioid Quality Improvement Collaborative to implement five opioid quality improvement measures at four IHS sites. Communication to employees and stakeholders involving best and promising practices and resources addressing pain management and addiction is achieved through our expanded internet presence. The IHS released a combined website for opioids in FY 2018 located at: www.ihs.gov/opioids . In August 2020, the IHS released new clinical decision support tools for RPMS to assist providers in meeting documentation standards outlined in IHM, Part 3 - Chapter 30. The EHR reminders and dia logue note templates facilitate accurate and timely documentation to support patient care and the pain management policy. The tools also address OIG findings from a recent IHS prescribing review. Increase Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) Interoperability and Usage: The IHS is working to improve public health data surveillance and reporting and has developed a data reporting system that will provide prescribing and diagnosis data on national and regional levels. This will enable IHS to track e merging trends, evaluate changes in prescribing practices, monitor CJ - 252o verdose rates and emergency department utilization, and assess changes with access to MAT. The IHS will evaluate expanded partnerships and data- related resources with other Federal partners and Tribal Epidemiology Centers in FY 2019. These reporting and surveillance tools will strengthen IHS program management and operations by improving communication within the organization with Tribes, Urban Indian Organizations, and other stakeholders, and with the general public Strategic Plan Goal 3, Objective 3.1 Improve communication within the organization, Tribes, Urban Indian Organizations, and other stakeholders, and with the general public . The IHS National Combined Councils Meeting (NCC) is an agency wide meeting which provides opportunities for multidisciplinary collaboration focusing on the clinical and administrative needs of the agency. This meeting offers an opportunity to provide continuing education trainings for healthcare providers , and previous session topics typically include : 1) Addressing the Opioid Crisis in Indian Country, 2) Exploring Best Practices in Chronic Pain Management, and 3) Evaluating Options for Creating and Sustaining Integrated Primary Care MAT Models. IHS also provided a 4.25-hour training, titled \"Prescriber Data Waiver Training. \" This training session assist participants with meeting the SAMHSA and DEA requirements to apply for a DATA waiver to prescribe buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid use disorder. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the 2021 NCC was held virtually with a limited agenda however IHS plans to resume NCC in -person me etings and trainings in FY 2022. Reducing Availability of Illicit and Dangerous Drugs: The IHS supports the safe and effectiv e disposal of unused pharmaceuticals at the enterprise level through the provision of reverse distributor services at Federal pharmacies for unopened expired controlled substances. The agency has participated in interagency efforts to support proper collection and disposal of pain medications. I/T/U pharmacies have continued to enroll as DEA collectors and to participate in prescription drug disposal efforts. IHS collaborated with the State of North Dakota to achieve 100 percent of IHS sites in the state (both Federal and Tribal) to be registered as DEA collectors. In FY 2019, the IHS expanded patient level disposal through the addition of 29 Federal Pharmacy sites as registered DEA controlled substance collectors. This included funding for supplies a nd technical assistance with DEA requirements. On the IHS pain management website, IHS provides resources for tribal and urban Indian communities on Take -Back Event, Permanent Collection Sites, Mail -Back Programs and Environmentally Safe Options from Ho me. The website also has two sessions focused on safe storage of medications and medication disposal for providers on proper opioid disposal. https://www.ihs.gov/painmanagement/disposal/patientdisposal/ Urban Indian Health Program - Alcohol and Substance Abuse Title V Grants FY 20 23 Request: $ 3.6 million The 41 UIOs are an integral part of the Indian health care system and serve as resources to both tribal and urban communities. Urban Indians are often invisible in the urban setting and face unique challeng es when accessing healthcare. A large proportion of Urban Indians live in or near poverty and face multiple barriers such as th e lack of quality and culturally relevant hea lth care services in cities. UIO s are an important support to Urban Indians seeking to maintain their tribal values and cultures and serve as a safety net for our urban patients. UIO s that offer inpatient and outpatient substance use disorder treatment have become reliable referral sites for Tribes and Urban Indians. In FY 2023, IHS is proposing $3.6 million for the urban ONDCP budget. CJ - 253A I/AN people who live in urban centers present a unique morbidity and mortality profile. Urban AI/AN populations suffer disproportionately higher mortality from certain causes in sharp contrast to mainstream society. These unique challenges require a targeted response. Existing UIOs see their efforts in health education, health promotion, and disease prevention as essential to impacting the behavioral contributors to poor health7: Alcohol-induced death rates are 2.8 times greater for urban AI/AN people than urban all races. Chronic liver disease death rates are 2.1 times greater for urban AI/AN people than urban all races. Accidents and external causes of death rates are 1.4 times greater for urban AI/AN people than urban all races. Alcohol and drug -related deaths continue to plague urban AI/AN people. Alcohol-induced mortality rates for urban AI/AN people are markedly higher than for urban all races. All regions, with the exception of eastern seaboard cities in the Nashville Area, show dramatically higher rates for urban AI/AN people than for urban all races who live in the same communities: the Billings Area is 4 times greater, the Phoenix Area is 6 times greater, the Tucson Area is 6.7 times greater, and the Great Plains Area has a 13.4 times greater alcohol-induced rate of mortality. 8 Urban AI/AN populations are more likely to engage in health risk behaviors. Urban AI/AN people are more likely to report heavy or binge drinking than all-race populations and urban AI/AN people are 1.7 times more likely to smoke cigarettes. Urban AI/AN people more often view themselves in poor or only fair health status, with 22.6 percent reporting fair/poor health as compared to 14.7 percent of all races reporting as fair/poor. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is a term used to describe a range of effects that can occur in someone whose mother consumed alcohol during pregnancy. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders include disorders such as fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol-related neuro developmental disorder, and alcohol-related birth defects. Interventions are needed in urban centers to address prevention efforts for urban AI/AN people with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. The IHS policy requires the IHS to confer with UIOs \"to develop and implement culturally sensitive assessment and diagnostic tools including dysm orphology clinics and multidisciplinary fetal alcohol spectrum disorders clinics for use in Indian communities and urban centers.\" Heavy drinking during pregnancy can cause significant birth defects, including fetal alcohol syndrome. Fetal alcohol syndrome is the leading and most preventable cause of intellectual disability. The rates of fetal alcohol syndrome are higher among AI/AN people than the general population. Screening with intervention has been shown to be effective in reducing alcohol misuse in pregnancy and to reduce the incidence of fetal alcohol syndrome. The UIO s emphasi ze integrating behavioral health, health education, health promotion, and disease prevention into primary care offered within a culturally appropriate framework, which leads to positive outcomes for urban AI/AN people. Urban AI/AN people in need of substance use disorder treatment commonly exhibit co-occurring disorders. UIOs have recognized the need for more mental health and substance use disorder counselors to adequately address the needs presented by AI/AN people with co -occurring disorders. Stakeholders reported the need for more age and gender-appropr iate resources for substance use disorder outpatient and residential 7 Indian Health Service, Report to Congress: New Needs Assessment of the Urban Indian Health Program and the Communities it Services at 10 (Mar. 31, 2016) (hereinafter New Needs Assessment), available at https://www.ihs.gov/urban/includes/themes/newihstheme/display_objects/documents/ReportToCongressUrbanNeedsAssessment.pdf. 8 Ibid. CJ - 254t reatment. While male AI/AN people can encounter wait times for treatment admission up to six months, treatment options for youth, women, and women with children can be greater than six months. Some of the most successful AI/AN treatment programs for youth, women, and women with children are administered by UIOs. Affecting lifestyle changes among urban AI/AN families requires a culturally sensitive approach. UIOs have operated cultural ly appropriate initiatives to reduce health risk factors. The continued efforts of UIOs to target behavioral or lifestyle changes offer the best hope for impacting the major health challenges of the urban AI/AN population. The IHS has contracts and grant s with 41 U IOs to provide health care and referral services for Urban Indians in 22 states. These IHS contracts and grants with UIOs address the IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 by ensuring that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to AI/AN people. UIOs provide high quality, culturally relevant prevention, early intervention, outpatient and residential substance abuse treatment services, and recovery support to address the unmet needs of the Urban Indian communit ies they serve. Social determinants of health play a key role in health and wellness and UIOs are addressing a range of factors which contribute to improved health outcomes. According to the most recent urban Indian data , 76,760 AI/A N patients access services through UIO programs. Also, UIOs perform ed 729,888 visits for AI/AN patients including medical, dental, behavioral health, other professional and enabling services directly or by paid refer ral. Data also indicates that members from 5 29 of the 5 74 (92 percent ) federal ly recognized T ribes accessed services from at least one of the 41 UIOs. In FY 2021, the IHS Office of Urban Indian Health Programs awarded 4- in-1 grants to 33 U IOs. The grantees are awarded for a three- year funding cycle from April 1, 2019 - March 31, 2022. These grants provide funding to U IOs to make health care services more accessible for A I/AN s residing in urban areas. Funding is used to support four health program areas: health promotion and disease prevention services; immunization services; alcohol and substance abuse related services; and mental health services. G rantees are required to participate in a national evaluation of the 4 -in-1 grant program, which addresses IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2 to promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization. The national evaluation includes reporting on the cultural interventions integrated into the 4- in-1 program activities, and practice base d and evidence based approaches that are implemented or modified to meet the needs of the Urban Indian service population. Many of the grantees reported interruptions/changes with their programs due to the COVID-19 pandemic: Many clinics run by UIOs had to temporarily close because they did not have the resources to provide a safe visit experience. Nearly all UIOs reported expanding telehealth services. There was an increase in demand for substance abuse and mental health treatment due to elevated lev els of anxiety and stress. All non- essential in -person activities were halted . Many programs across various UIOs were switched to a virtual format . Some activities, such as a back -to-school health fair, were transitioned to be a drive-thru process. Despite the importance of many of these virtual services, many clients that UIOs serve lack internet capabilities, creating a significant barrier to accessing services. CJ - 255 E lders expressed less desire in meeting virtually. EQUITY Alcohol and Substance Abuse In FY 2023, the IHS budget request for its drug control activities supports the Office of National Drug Control and Policy (ONDCP) funding priorities as well as the ONDCP Strategy . The Strategy emphasizes the partnership between Federal agencies and their state, local, tribal, and international counterparts and reduce drug-induced mortality. IHS is also working to improve equity and reduce barriers to substance use disorder (SUD) treatment and services. In May of 2020, IHS released a trauma informed care policy to provide guidance to Indian Health Service facilities to improve patient engagement and improve health outcomes as well as supporting provider and staff wellness. In 2021, IHS established a multidisciplinary workgroup to create and sustain a cult ure of physical, psychological, and emotional safety for all individuals and staff that have experienced trauma. In additional, many of the IHS Division of Behavioral Health SUD programs and initiatives include objectives such as \"Increasing Access to Care\" and \"Increasing Access to Medication -assisted Treatment.\" Understanding the urgent need to the prioritize specific populations such as children and youth, and their families as appropriate in SUD prevention, treatment and recovery efforts, IHS will require each of the Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention (SASP) grantees to develop culturally-appropriate approaches to engage youth in prevention and treatment activities. IHS recognizes that telemedicine is one tool for increasing access to specialized medical services, such as telebehavioral health. To that end, IHS provided a 23 percent increase in telebehavorial health encounters nationally among AI/AN between FY 2020 and FY 2021. Finally, as resource to AI/AN healthcare providers, IHS hosted Clini cian Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHOs) sessions to provide, timely, up- to-date information related to emerging SUD treatment and services among rural and remote AI/AN communities. Urban Indian Health Program In FY 2021, the OUIHP lever aged the IHS Office of Public Health Support's Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to develop a new 5- year IHS OUIHP strategic plan. On December 3, 2021, the IHS initiated urban confer to seek input and recommendations on the new strategic plan to improve access to high quality, culturally competent health services for Urban Indians, which addresses IHS Strategic Plan Goal 2 to promote excellence and quality through innovation of the Indian health system into an optimally performing organization. In FY 2022, the expectation is to evaluate the existing OUIHP strategic plan and establish a new strategic plan, including goals, strategies and performance measures based on recommendations from UIOs, partners, and external stakeholders. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Pub. L. No. 116-260) (hereinafter \"the Act\") was signed into law. The Act provided the Indian Health Service (IHS) with a total FY 2021 appropriation of $6.4 billion. The Joint Explanatory Sta tement for Division G for the Act designated $1,000,000 to conduct an infrastructure study for facilities run by Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs). The infrastructure study provides the first step towards creating a comprehensive action plan to focus on improving equity and reduce barriers to programs and services, which addresses IHS Strategic Plan Goal 1 to ensure that comprehensive, culturally appropriate personal and public health services are available and accessible to American Indian and Alaska Nati ve people. In FY 2021, the IHS initiated urban confer to seek input on developing CJ - 256a nd implementing the infrastructure study from UIOs. In FY 2022, the IHS awarded a contract to The Innova Group to conduct the infrastructure study to identify future facilit y needs of UIOs.

The new account provides additional budget authority to fully fund such costs without the need for reprogramming, if actual co sts exceed the current estimate. IHS is reminded of the directive to continue to seek a longer-term solution, as contained in the explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 116-94. Further direction is provided in the bill under Title IV of this divisio n. (pg. 80) Action taken or to be taken: The FY 2023 President's Budget proposes to shift funding for Tribal Lease Payment and Contract Support Costs to an annual mandatory indefinite appropriation. Section 105(l) Lease Agreements. In March 2016, the Man iilaq Association v. Burwell decision established a new funding entitlement for Tribal contractors and compactors as authorized by section 105(l) of the ISDEAA. The court ruled that the Secretary must compensate reasonable costs to each Tribe or Tribal organization who enters into a section 105(l) lease agreement. The court also prohibits IHS from capping funding under section 105(l) at the level that IHS would have otherwise spent to operate a facility if it were carrying out the health programs. o In FY 2 021, Congress enacted an indefinite discretionary appropriation to fully fund these costs. An indefinite discretionary appropriation allows IHS to fund section 105(l) lease agreements at the actual total funding need for the fiscal year, aligning the budget to the court decisions in Maniilaq Association v. Burwell. This funding mechanism avoids the need to redirect funding that IHS would otherwise use to provide direct services to Tribes. o These costs are more appropriately funded from mandatory appropriat ions, consistent with other indefinite authorities. Current Services. - The Committee expects the Service to continue including current services estimates for Urban Indian hea lth in annual budget requests. (p. 80) Action taken or to be taken: The FY 2023 Congressional funding request for Current Services is $207,070,000, which would fully fund pay cost, inflation, and population growth needs for IHS, Tribal, and urban Indian health programs in FY 2023.

Thus, the Committee continues to expect IHS to submit, within 90 days of enactment of this Act, a full accounting of the funds provided for accreditation emergencies in fiscal years 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, including the amount and purpose of funds allocated to each facility. CJ - 263The Committee is concerned about financial losses from loss of CMS accreditation or of the requirement to divert patients at Service -operated facilities. The Committee considers the loss or imminent loss of accreditation to be an emergency. Funds allocated to a facility may be made available to Tribes newly assuming operation of such facilities pursuant to the Indian Self- Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 (ISDEAA) and shall be used by such Tribes to cover replacement of third-party revenues lost as a result of decertification, replacement of third -party carryover funds expended to respond to decertification, and reasonable costs of achieving recertification, including recruitment costs necessary to stabilize staffing. Additionally, the Com mittee continues to urge IHS to develop new strategies to improve how IHS programs, including those operated by Tribes under ISDEAA, can be supported to avoid these challenges and to refocus on both the quality of health care delivery and the improvement in health outcomes for, and health status of, Indian health program beneficiaries. This requires full Tribal consultation and the participation of the Department of Health and Human Services, CMS, CMS Innovation, and State Medicaid and State Children's Heal th Insurance programs. Action taken or to be taken: Since our last response to thi s report language in the FY 2021 and FY 2022 Congressional Justifications , the IHS has taken a number of steps to develop and implement new strategies to avoid future accreditation challenges. FY 2022 Activities to Date: Strategic Plan Implementation . The IHS Strategic Plan FY 2019 -2023 provides the framework on how the IHS will achieve its mission (to raise the physical, mental, social, and spiritual health of AI/AN to the highest level) through three Goals, eight objectives, and 70 strategies. To monitor implementation of the framework, the Office of Quality (OQ) created a site that allows for IHS Area and Headquarter (HQ) Office reporting into a centralized locati on, the Strategic Plan Activity Repository (SPAR). Area and HQ offices select high bar activities to include in the SPAR. These activities are updated quarterly (or more frequently depending on office use of the SPAR) and tied to a strategy. The IHS Str ategic Plan has focused IHS programs and activities on improving quality, safety, and sustained compliance across the IHS healthcare system. To date in FY22, 342 total activities from Areas and HQ offices are currently tied to the IHS Strategic Plan, all 12 Areas and 12 HQ offices have contributed activities and updates. Current Accreditation Status. The IHS has supported facilities in all 12 IHS Areas to achieve and maintain The Joint Commission (TJC) and Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Centers (AAAHC) accreditation standards and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) regulations for IHS Hospitals, Health Centers, Behavioral Health facilities, and Critical Assess Hospitals (CAH). o In FY22, as of March 25, there have been 16 successful su rveys by TJC (including TJC Lab surveys), AAAHC, and CMS completed at facilities. o The IHS has also directed that all ambulatory care facilities attain Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) designation by the end of calendar year 2022. In FY22, eight facilities have attained PCMH designation. Credentialing Privileging . The IHS monitors the credentialing and privileging system and continuously optimizes its functions. o To date in FY22, the IHS is 96% complete with an initial phase of standardization. Safety Tracking & Response. The IHS Safety Tracking & Response (I -STAR), a system for reporting adverse events, is fully implemented across the Agency. The IHS monitors the system and is continuously optimizing its functions. In FY22, as of December 202 1 events were reported CJ - 264in I-STAR from 135 facilities and 32 Tribal facilities. These sites entered 5,172 events with 1,746 medication good catch events entered. After an event is entered into I -STAR, relevant users are notified and events are investigated by the facility or Service Unit I -STAR investigator. Infection Prevention and Control . The IHS continues to provide infection prevention and control activities. o In FY22, the Infection Control and Prevention (ICP) program completed an Infection Control Assessment and Response (ICAR) at a Nashville Area YRTC as part of a project that provided (77 total) COVID -19 infection control assessments at IHS and Tribal facilities in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Additional ICARs can be requested by IHS, tribal, and urban Indian organizations. The ICP coordinated with the Organization for Safety Asepsis and Prevention (OSAP) to secure tribal and Urban Indian Organization scholarships for the annual OSAP Dental Infection Control Bootcamp which was held in January 2022. In total, 14 tribal scholarships were awarded and participants will be able to describe disease transmission and principles of infection prevention and control in a variety of or al health care settings; identify relevant infection control laws, regulations, guidelines, standards, and best practices; and, utilize tools to assist with quality assurance measures. FY 2021 Activities: o Accreditation S upport . In FY21, survey and PCMH designation outcomes include: 100 percent of all IHS hospitals and CAHs have achieved and maintained CMS conditions of participation, 21 of 24 hospitals and CAHs have TJC accreditation. 29 of 30 of IHS health centers are accredited by TJC or AAAHC. The on e health center not accredited does not provide the services required to obtain accreditation. 16 of 24 IHS Hospitals and Critical Access Hospitals have PCMH designation, of these facilities are awaiting TJC survey that is overdue due to the delay in surv ey activity due to the COVID -19 Public Health Emergency. 28 of 30 established health centers have achieved PCMH designation. Two facilities are awaiting TJC accreditation survey that are overdue due to the delay in survey activity due to the COVID -19 Public Health Emergency. o In August 2020, the Labor and Delivery Service at Phoenix Indian Med ical Center (PIMC) was temporarily closed due to safety concerns arising from facility infrastructure, equipment, and challenges with staffing. PIMC contracted for an intensive Joint Commission Resources Review in September 2020 as well as an internal revi ew by the IHS Chief Clinical Consultant for Obstetrics on September 17-18. Both reviews focused on facility deficiencies, equipment deficiencies, infection control, OB Triage, and interdisciplinary teamwork. To support addressing concerns identified in these reviews, IHS engaged a contractor to provide accreditation support and review care provided by the Obstetrics Department at PIMC. The contractor conducted a review of IHS operations at PIMC, provided a gap analysis, and then worked with IHS leadership and management to provide training and mentoring, providing training, sharing best practices and conducting a mock survey to test PIMC's readiness for an accreditation survey. In October 2021, TJC conducted an announced survey of PIMC, which resulted in reaccreditation. Without Accreditation Emergencies Funding, PIMC would have been forced to curtail some patient services to afford this level of support for their operations. o C redentialing and Privileging . In FY21, the OQ continues to improve the IHS credentialing and privileging process through the implementation of Applied Statistics & Management, Inc. (ASM ) Products credentialing and privileging software which is being used in 11/12 Areas to facilitate the hiring and ongoing monitoring of qualified CJ - 265practitioners. The Alaska Area is pending implementation by tribal facilities, the Area does not have any direct service sites. The OQ provides technical assistance through training and support to Areas and facilities for ASM use and promotes the transition to 100 percent paperless. The OQ is also facilitating a quality improvement project for standardization. The system completes a monthly check on an average of 3,000 active medical staff provider credentials, flagging any negatively changed items and to date has processed nearly 2,459 initial appointment and reappointment applications. An initial phase of standardization is at 95 percent implementation across all IHS areas. In FY21, standardization increased from 54 percent to 95 percent (over 40 percent increase), there were 858 initial applications, 2,791 reappointment applications, 141,445 total verifications, and 21,785 MD- Staff reports generated. As of December 2021, the system continues to process user Logins, virtual Committee Reviews, MD -App Initial Applications, and MD -App - Reappointment Applications. o Safety Tracking & Response. In FY21, events were reported in I-STAR from 172 facilities and 42 Tribal facilities. 20,668 events were entered with 7,637 medication good catch events entered. In FY 21, the OQ began holding regular office hours and provided 37 Q&A sessions; modified I-STAR to allow for enhanced reporting and collection of data for sexual assault and worker COVID -19 vaccine ADRs; developed back-up forms for user use during I-STAR downtimes; developed an IHS Medication Safety Dashboard that includes 13 standard reports commonly used for reporting medication errors to Area Governing Boards; added three new facilities as I -STAR users; developed a new I -STAR profile to help Tribal I -STAR users to review and close events; developed and disseminated five I -STAR Updates to provide an overview of use and education tips to help users; developed and posted 13 new job aides to assist users; added 33 new drugs to the I- STAR formulary; and, migrated non -patient safety data from WebCident to I - STAR. o Infection Prevention and Control. The IPC program drafted the IHS Indian Health Manual Infection Control and Prevention (Chapter 33), the purpose of the chapter is to establish infection control and prevention program policies, procedures, and responsibilities required for ensuring a com prehensive ICP program exists in all IHS health care facilities and Service Units. An ICP program is required to meet and maintain readiness with applicable healthcare accreditation standards. The IHS manages the ICP listserv with 312 I/T/U users that regu larly distributes infection prevention and control resources, updates and provides expert technical assistance across the health system. In FY21, the IHS conducted 43 ICAR assessments at IHS and Tribal facilities. Electronic Health Record - The Committe es recognize the need for a new electronic health record system to improve the overall interoperability, efficiency, and security of the Service's information technology system. The Committees also note that the Service has not completed directives on this topic included in previous fiscal years and solicited in hearings. The Committees direct the Service to report back within 120 days of enactment of this Act with a list of Tribes that currently maintain their own non - RPMS electronic health record systems along with cost estimates required for those Tribes to implement, maintain, and make any necessary upgrades to these systems. Further directions and limitations on expenditures are provided in the bill. The Committees understand that many Tribes recently upgraded their systems to be compatible with the new Veterans Affairs' system, and that these systems must be compatible with any new IHS system to the maximum extent practicable. It is the Committees' expectation that the Service will be able to use the compiled information gathered during this recent effort with Veterans Affairs to inform both the Service and the Committees on which Tribes use their own system and the estimated costs. (p. 78-79) CJ - 266Action Taken or to be Taken: On January 13, 2022 IHS submitted a report to the Committee, Tribal Health Programs Electronic Health Reports Systems, as requested in the Explanatory Statement which accompanied the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 . Unfunded IHCIA Provisions . - It has been over nine years since the permanent reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA), yet many of the provisions in the law remain unfunded. Tribes have specifically requested that priority areas for funding focus on diabetes treatment and prevention, behavioral health, and health professions. The Committee requests that the Service provide, no later than 90 days after enactmen t of this Act, a detailed plan with specific dollars identified to fully fund and implement the IHCIA. (pg. 132) Action taken or to be taken: The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) is the cornerstone legal authority for the provision of health care to American Indian and Alaska Natives. The authorization was made permanent as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) on March 23, 2010. The IHCIA includes a number of authorizations, and a list of those sections is in cluded in Appendix A. Estimating the cost of fully funding those provisions would be a significant endeavor, requiring significant tribal consultation and urban confer. It would also be a resource intensive process that would likely require additional ap propriations to conduct appropriately. However, the IHS has several existing methodologies of estimating funding need that can be used as a proxy to estimate the funding needed for the various authorized sections of the IHCIA. Those measures include: I ndian Health Care Improvement Fund Workgroup Interim Report. The 2018 Indian Health Care Improvement Fund Formula identified a total funding need of over $11 billion for health care and related services to American Indians and Alaska Natives after taking into account the FY 2018 IHS appropriation. This estimate does not take into account facilities funding needs, or funding needs for major projects, like Electronic Health Record modernization. (Microsoft Word - IHC IF Interim Report_Final June 2018 (ihs.gov) Indian Health Service and Tribal Health Care Facilities' Needs Assessment. Every five years, the IHS transmits th e Indian Health Service and Tribal Health Care Facilities' Needs Assessment Report to Congress . This report describes the comprehensive, national, ranked list of all health care facilities needs for the IHS, Indian tribes, and tribal organizations. The m ost recent version of this plan was completed in FY 2016 (https://www.ihs.gov/sites/newsroom/themes/responsive2017/display_objects/documents/RepCo ng_2016/IHSRTC_on_FacilitiesNeedsAssessmentReport.pdf , and identifies a $14.5 billion funding need for health care facilities in Indian Country. o T his estimate includ es the $2.1 billion needed to complete the 1993 Health Care Facilities Construction Priority List. o It also includes the top 5 Tribally -prioritized facility types newly authorized in the IHCIA, listed below. These five facility types total $4.3 billion of the $14.5 billion total. Inpatient mental health/behavioral health and alcohol substance abuse program facilities, Long- term care facilities - Clinical, Long- term care facilities - Non-clinical, Specialty Medical Services facilities, and Dialysis facilities. CJ - 267 Annual Report on Sanitation Deficiency Levels for Indian Homes and Communities. Each year, the IHS transmits the Annual Report on Sanitation Deficiency Levels for Indian Homes and Communities to Congress (Annual Report To the Congress of the United States On Sanitation Deficiency Levels for Indian Homes and Communities Fiscal Year 2018 (ihs.gov) . The information in this report to Congress is used by the Indian Health Service (IHS) to establish budgetary funding requests and to allocate funding resources received. Additionally, the United States (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development, and the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation utilize the information contained in this report to aid in the implementation of their programs tha t support tribal water, sewer, and solid waste infrastructure. At the end of year (EOY) 2021, t he Feasible Project Cost Estimate from the IHS Sanitation Deficiency System (SDS) totals $1 billion, and the total cost of all projects in the SDS is over $ 3.3 billion. The EOY 2021 SDS project listing will be used to identify projects that will be funded with funding appropriated to the IHS through the Infrastructure, Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). The IIJA appropriates $700 million in each year from 2022 - FY 2026, for a total of $3.5 billion for the IHS Sanitation Facilities Construction (SFC) program. These resources are available until expended , for the provision of domestic and community sanitation facilities for Indians, as authorized . Backlog of Essential Maintenance and Repair (BEMAR) . T he IHS maintains and regularly updates the BEMAR for IHS and Tribal health programs. The total BEMAR as of October 1, 2021 is $ 1,022 million. A lzheimer's \u2014 The Committee expects IHS to work with the Health Resou rces and Services Administration in the development of any training curriculum. Finally, the Committee directs IHS to prepare and submit a report to the Committee describing the incident rates of Alzheimer's among AI/AN and access to services within IHS -funded programs. In addition, the Committee is concerned that IHS- funded facilities are not adequately prepared for the expected increase in Native patients with Alzheimer's. Therefore, the Committee directs IHS, in consultation with Indian Tribes and Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs), to develop a plan to assist those with Alzheimer's, the additional services required, and the costs associated with increasing Alzheimer's patients and submit this information to Congress within 270 days of enactment of this A ct. Action taken or to be taken: The IHS hosted Tribal Consultation and Urban Confer with Tribes and Urban Indian Organizations on the approach to address the impact of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and on the best use of this funding. That consultation began on March 31 and concluded on June 1, 2021. The IHS issued the joint Dear Tribal Leader and Dear Urban Indian Organization Leader Letter that formally closes out that process on March 24, 2022. We have incorporated the consultation received throughout the process in our program development which will be reflected in the 2021 funding appropriation plan for the Alzheimer's Grant Program. The IHS will use this data to inform the Report to Congress. The IHS is working with the CDC on an analy sis of IHS data that indicates the impact and burden of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias among AI/AN and access to services within IHS -funded programs. The IHS is in the process of gathering data to quantify the impact of Alzheimer's on AI/AN peop le, additional services needed, and costs associated with care of IHS beneficiaries living with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers. The IHS has engaged with HRSA to explore training curriculum. The HRSA Core Curriculum in Dementia provides a comprehensive set of on-line modules with training guides. https://bhw.hrsa.gov/alzheimers-dementia- training . Th e IHS has made this available to IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian health providers through a link on our website and will continue to discuss with CJ - 268HRSA opportunities for further curriculum development, including curriculum specific to IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian Health. The IHS will also work with HRSA and the HRSA -funded Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP) awardees with a focus on outreach and engagement with IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian Health programs to identify training opportunities for Indian Health. In addition, the IHS has engaged with the CDC-funded NYU BOLD Public Health Center for Excellence on Early Detection of Dementia to develop a strategy and resources to support improved detection of dementia leading to effective care. The IHS and Alzheimer' s Association is in the final stages of establishing an MOU to identify areas of collaboration to address and improve the health and well -being of American Indians and Alaska Natives living with Alzheimer's disease and all other dementias and their caregiv ers. Green Infrastructure. - The Committee directs IHS to submit a report to the Committee within 90 days of enactment of this Act explaining how it proposes to use the funds provided for green infrastructure and renewable energy. Action taken or to be t ak en: The IHS will support the following green infrastructure activities with the $5 million provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021: Funded with GI FY21 Southcentral Foundation LED Conversion for Building 119, Southcentral Foundation LED Conversation for Building 122, Village Clinic Energy Retrofits, Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation Solar and Water Project, Pascua Yaqui Tribe Lighting, Solar Water Heater, and Solar Energy Project, Parker Energy Renovation, Pechanga Indian Health Clinic Solar Energy Project, MCAT Health Board Carport Solar Energy Project, Cass Lake Geothermal Energy Project, (Partial Funded) Urban Indian Organization. - Similar to Indian country, the coronavirus pandemic is showcasing the need for infrastructure at UIO facilities. Within funds provided, the recommendation includes $1,000,000 for IHS to confer with UIOs, conduct a study on UIO infrastructure needs and to prepare a report on the study to Congress. The Committee directs IHS to complete urban confer with UIOs within 120 days of enactment of this Act. The study and report shall be completed within one year after completion of urban confer with UIOs. Within 30 days of completion of the study and report, the Committee expects IHS to submit the report to the Committee. Action taken or to be taken: Urban confer wa s held on July 22, 2021 and a contractor was chosen for the UIO Infrastructure Study. The Innova Group was contracted to conduct the UIO Infrastructure Study and preliminary activities began February 2022. Estimated completion date for the study is January 2023. Indian Health Professions -Within amounts provided, the Committee expects IHS to continue the Quentin N. Burdick American Indians Into Nursing Program, the Indians into Medicine Program, and t he American Indians Into Psychology Program at enacted levels. The Committee heard complaints about the numerous steps and delays in processing scholarship and loan repayment applications to the point that some medical professionals have turned down IHS positions to accept other positions. As a result, the CJ - 269Committee directs IHS to review its processes and timeliness in reviewing and approving applications and submit a report within 180 days of enactment of this Act to the Committee on how IHS can streamline the application process and expedite its review processes. The Committee directs IHS to report to the Committee specifying the types of scholarship, loan repayment programs, and other incentives for which Commission Corps officers are eligible. IHS should highlight any incentive programs directed towards those officers who work in Indian Country. (Pg . 131) Action taken or to be taken: This request applies to multiple programs and services within the IHS. The IHS fully supports the continuing administration of the Quentin N. Burdick American Indians Into Nursing Program, the Indians into Medicine Program, and the American Indians Into Psychology Program. The IHS Scholarship and Loan Scholarship Program application processing timeline is separate from the hiring of medical personnel. The IHS continues to partner with the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps to commission and onboard new Commissioned Officers and optimize special pays through the Commissioned Corps for which an Officer may be eligible. The reviewing and approving applications for the IHS Scholarship Program (SP) has no impact on the hiring process because the r ecipients are not medical professionals. The IHS SP funds health care professions students entering into their educational career. Students are awarded funding each semester of school by the Program. Scholarship recipients are unable to apply for positi ons because they are not licensed and trained healthcare professionals. Once they finish the program, and become licensed, they receive the highest priority in IHS to secure a position. In addition, IHS works closely with the Scholars prior to graduation to assist them in securing a position. The hiring process of medical personnel is separate and not dependent on the IHS Loan Repayment Program (LRP) award process. IHS LRP ap plicants must be employed in an eligible Indian health program first, in orde r to be considered for an award. Medical personnel must submit employment verification from an eligible/approved facility when applying. The LRP application cycle is open year around. Awards are made with available funding from January -August each year . The timeline to administer the program and fund recipients is based on a fully funded budget for the fiscal year. In recent years, partially approved budgets have delayed the program's ability to fund recipients in January. All recipients that applied and met the program requirements in FY 2021 were funded. If a health care professional was not funded, it was because they did not find a suitable assignment prior to applying to the program that met their personal or professional needs. U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) Commissioned Corps Officers have various incentives depending on the discipline. Incentives for USPHS Commissioned Corps Officers include, but not limited to: Health Professions Special Pay (HPSP), Assignment Pay and National Health Service Corps (NHSC) Loan Repayment program, and the IHS Loan Repayment Program.. Electronic Dental Record. - The Committee is concerned that the entire $2,000,000 provided in fiscal year 2020 was not directed towards EDR at additional dental centers. Therefore, the Committee directs IHS to submit an accounting of fiscal year 2020 funds and expects IHS to use the fiscal year 2021 funds only for EDR. In addition, IHS is directed to expand its efforts in planning and developing greater data and informatio n exchange between the IHS EHR system and the EDR system. Action taken or to be taken: This matter was addressed in the FY 2022 CJ to illustrate inclusion of expanded EDR Implementation and Upgrade Support at Indian Health Service/Tribal/Urban (I/T/U) Sites. The +$2 million for the Electronic Dental Record appropriated in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020, and the CJ - 270Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 were used only for the Electronic Dental Record and were not distributed as tribal shares. FY 2020 funds supported ($ 2 million total): New Electronic Dental Record Implementation at 9 I/T/U Sites ($906,000) Electronic Health Record Program Enhancements, including key consent forms, quality review, and other reports ($615,000 ) Electronic De ntal Record Upgrade Support for 64 I/T/U sites ($400,000) Other activities including developing new Electronic Dental Record technology and training ($79,000) The FY 2020 activities include some base resources, in addition to the +$2 million increase. FY 2021 funds supported ($ 2.5 million total): New Electronic Dental Record Implementation at 13 I/T/U Sites ($1.1 million ) Electronic Dental Record Upgrade Support for 66 I/T/U sites ($ 800k ) (38 sites were T/U) o Additional funding enabled no 'shared cost' to the clinics; thus higher 'per site' upgrade cost for FY 2021) Electronic Health Record Program Enhancements, including Dentrix Provider Clinical Notes transition to EHR; Dentrix scanned document QA review; and Quality of Care review reports ($500,000) Other activities including developing new Electronic Dental Record technology and additional Dentrix to EHR interfaces ($ 100,000) The FY 2021 activities include some base resources, in addition to the +$2.5 million increase. FY 2022 funds are supporting ($2.5 million ): New Electronic Dental Record Implementation at 9 -11 I/T/U Sites ($1.1 million ) Electronic Dental Record Upgrade Support for 90 I/T/U sites ($1.25 million ) Electronic Health Record Program Enhancements, including charting, note taking, and additional patient quality of care review enhancements ($ 150,000) Other activities including developing additional new Electronic Dental Record technology and training ($200,000). The FY 2022 expenditures are estimates as EDR funding resources are prioritized to meet the greatest needs of the IHS I/T /U clinics and these essential EDR activities always require additional DHP base resources in addition to the +$2.5 million. H.R. 116-448/S.R. 116- 123 Language. - IHS is expected to comply with the instructions and requirements at the beginning of this division and in House Report 116-448, unless otherwise specified below. Language contained in Senate Report 116-123 regarding the Alaska Comprehensiv e Forensic Training Academy, first aid kit enhancements, prescription drug monitoring, and teledermatology is restated. Action taken or to be taken: This matter was addressed in the FY 2022 CJ. IHS provided a list of all IHS facilities with pharmacies and released PDMP reporting software that reports to state PDMPs automatically, when a prescription is filled, in near real time. First Aid Kit Enhancements - The use of hemostatic dressings is an element of the standard of care in the initial management of trauma patients and should be included, along with basic education around the CJ - 271use of such materials, as standard equipment for rural EMS and ED inventories. IHS will provide a recommendation to IHS, tribal, and Urban facilities for EMS and ED to consider adding these materials for EMS and ED use. (See CJ -229) Prescription Drug Monitoring . - Although there is no federal law requiring IHS to report to state PDMPs, in June of 2016 IHS implemented Indian Health Manual Part 3 Chapter 32 \"State Prescription Drug Monitoring Program\", which requires all IHS federal pharmacies to report controlled prescriptions to their respective state PDMPs. Currently all IHS Federal Facilities, with pharmacies, report to the state PDMP, in the state where they are located. In addition, in May 2019, IHS released PDMP reporting software that reports to state PDMPs automatically, when a prescription is filled, in near real time. In 2021, the IHS allocated funding to support PDMP interoperability within the IHS EHR. Software and connectivity architecture are currently under development. (See CJ -299) IHS does not t rack the participation of Tribally -operated health facilities with State PDMPs. Teledermatology - Less than 10 percent of all dermatologists practice in rural areas while 40 percent practice in the 100 densest US areas. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, the ideal dermatologist to population ratio is 3.5 per 100,000 (although the appropriate ratio has never been validated) and the mean dermatologist to population ratio of rural counties is 423 per 100,000 people. However, 88 percent of rur al counties have zero dermatologists. The 26 Native American majority counties have no dermatologists. The IHS has considered potential options for expanding tele-dermatology. One cost- effective solution could be to expand the tele -dermatology capacity of the Phoenix Indian Medical Center as well as leveraging private dermatologists who are willing to provide tele-dermatology services pro bono. Long- term solutions like targeted recruiting efforts, and the purchase of mobile high definition cameras wou ld likely require additional resources. (see CJ -302) Maternal Health. - Pregnancy- related deaths have increased generally in the United States with pregnancy-related deaths for American Indian and Alaska Native women more than twice the non- Hispanic white women rate. The Committee directs IHS to submit a rep ort to the Committee within 180 days of enactment of this Act on use of funds, updates on staff hiring, status of related standards, and the amount of training provided under this Initiative. The Committee continues to encourage IHS to establish a pilot program to determine the most effective ways to: (1) educate IHS health care providers on how to evaluate risk factors that could interfere with successfully meeting breastfeeding goals; (2) provide necessary support to AI/AN mothers to prevent or address delayed initiation of milk production during the critical period immediately following birth; and (3) provide support to AI/AN mothers to help them understand the benefits of long- term breastfeeding and improve clinically recommended rates, particularly when they return to work. The Committee also directs IHS to coordinate with employers within the community to develop breastfeeding support recommendations within the workplace that encourage job rete ntion. (See CJ -127-128) Action taken or to be taken: In the OIG Report, dated 09/08/2020; OEI-06-19-00190: Instances of IHS Labor and Delivery Care Not Following National Clinical Guidelines or Best Practices, three final recommendations were made as follows: 1. Assess labor and delivery practices and consider practice improvements 2. Ensure that IHS providers employ best practices in diagnosing and treating postpartum hemorrhage CJ - 2723. Encourage and support greater adoption of Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Healt h (AIM) bundles of maternal- safety best practices To provide the safest care possible, IHS and Tribal sites have engaged in implementation of the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM) bundles, with an early emphasis on implementation of the Obstetric Hemorrhage and Hypertension bundles and other bundles as prioritized by the individual sites. Limitations on data sharing have precluded full AIM enrollment for IHS and Tribal hospitals but all sites performing planned births are otherwise engaged in AIM quality improvement efforts and in their respective State Perinatal Collaboratives where available. Some facilities, particularly the more rural or remote sites without a planned birthing unit, or those sites with planned birth units but low volume and/or delayed transport may be faced with additional challenges in obstetrical emergency preparedness. There is currently a large body of evidence surrounding implementation of simulation drills for obstetrical emergency preparedness and thus sites are en couraged to engage in regular simulation training. Many IHS clinicians have completed the Advanced Life Support in Obstetrics (ALSO) course, and ALSO courses are offered regularly at regional sites across the I/T/U system. IHS has purchased and disseminated 50 childbirth simulation models for use in these emergency drills and in conducting local ALSO courses to enhance obstetric readiness. Further support of rural Emergency Departments (E.D.s) to ensure obstetric readiness includes working closely with indi vidual facilities to develop and support appropriate staff training and ensuring access to necessary supplies and equipment. IHS is working with tertiary care facilities to provide telehealth support via video link for E.D.s without on- site maternity care providers. This Rural Obstetric Readiness program is following the Emergency Medicine principles of quality improvement, emphasizing attention to tools, training, and tracking. IHS has supported self- efficacy in prenatal care and provided glucometers, co ntinuous glucose monitors (CGMs), and blood pressure cuffs when indicated. A recent Maternal Child Health (MCH) initiative will increase blood pressure cuff access for many more prenatal patients. 825 automatic blood pressure cuffs were purchased and provi ded to several service units for patient home use and monitoring. Providing these cuffs to patients helps to increase access to care by removing barriers such as transportation and/or childcare. IHS will continue to explore partnerships with the Pre- Eclamp sia Foundation in order to facilitate greater access to self-monitored blood pressure equipment throughout Indian Country. IHS has had a consultative relationship with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Committee on American Indian and Alaska Native Women's Health for over 50 years. ACOG provides quality- benchmarking site visits, guidance on maternity care and women's health best practices, and ongoing training for IHS, Tribal, and Urban staff. ACOG, along with the Canadian SOGC , sponsors a biennial \"Meeting on Indigenous Women's Health\" which provides an important forum to address common themes and share solutions. The ACOG Committee work includes liaisons from the American College of Nurse Midwives (ACNM), the American Women's Health, Obstetric, and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). All federal IHS hospitals providing planned birth services have earned the \"Baby Friendly\" designation by Baby -Friendly USA . Currently, one facility is pending re-designation due to staffing shortages, but is working to address this situation. Comprehensive breastfeeding education and continued lactation support are mainstays of this designation. The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) designation ensures education is provided during prenatal care and lactation support is routinely offered throughout the hospital stay and postpartum. IHS further promotes breastfeeding opportunities through the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative, building organizational capacity and practice -based resources, developing partnerships to advance breastfeeding, and incorporating breastfeeding into its robust public health programs. Breastfeeding education is included in trainings offered to IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian CJ - 273Organization health staff, including those offered in partnership with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on American Indian and Alaska Native Women's Health. Baby -Friendly designation naturally leads to education and support of breastfeeding to become engrained in daily operations of the hospitals. Education on early warning signs, how to recognize these warning signs, when to return to care, whether that should be for routine or emergent care, and information on a large network of resources available for new mothers are important pieces of this breastfeeding support post-discharge. In addition to efforts specifically related to maintaining the BFHI designation, IHS continues to monitor Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) rates and several sites have initiated intensive QI projects around breastfeeding. IHS has b uilt partnerships between Tribes and the AIM Community Care Initiative (AIM CCI), and has enjoyed a long-standing partnership with the American Academy of Pediatrics-Committee on Native American Child Health (CONACH) and works closely with these entities i n implementation of any recommendations to improve infant feeding outcomes and resultant child health indicators. IHS partners with Tribes, urban Indian organizations, and local and state governments in order to ensure comprehensive, culturally appropriat e lactation services are provided for the American Indian and Alaskan Native women and families served. One example includes linking patients with postpartum resources available to them after discharge, which include a variety of ways to access support, o nline, by phone, or in person including home visitation programs. Postpartum visits are also offered by public health/community health programs in many communities; offering 1:1 assistance and support, in home, which helps to remove access to care barriers such as transportation or child care for other children, and also helps to ensure cultural sensitivity for those patients practicing traditional beliefs and customs surrounding childbirth. Several certified lactation consultants and counselors are employed by IHS, and sites have offered incentives for this continued education and certification. Referrals can be placed by the public health/community health programs for additional lactation support or other resources as needed. IHS offers resources about breastfeeding promotion and support on the Baby Friendly webpage . This public facing page is available on the general website for patients, staff and other interested individuals to access freely. The page inc ludes information about breastfeeding promotion and support, standard of care, breastfeeding benefits, common problems, clinical challenges, and a toolkit on providing breastfeeding education. F unding from this initiative has not yet been expended; however, f uture actions utilizing the maternal/mortality initiative funding will provide care to better meet the health care needs of American Indian and Alaska Native communities as outlined above. IHS hired a new Maternal Child Health consultant who will be s tarting in May 2022 and will lead the IHS Maternal Health efforts.

Because the cost of vaccines for children < 19 years of age is covered by the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program , only the costs for vaccine administration, which are not covered by the VFC program, are included for this age group. Estimated immunization expenditures include projected costs for routine, on-schedule immunization s among core patient demographic groups based on current age-appropriate immu nization schedules. Other individuals outside these core patient groups may be regular 1. The immunization estimates do not include the Hepatitis B and Haemophi lus Immunization (AK) program; estimates for these immunizations are included under the Immunization Alaska budget. CJ - 277recipients o f immunizations (e.g., health care worke rs; patients at specific increased risk for certain vaccine- preventable diseases). However , there is not currently a methodology to accurately estimate the size or vaccination coverage rates for all of these patient groups. Therefore, some special pa tient groups are excluded from these expenditure estimates. Costs for monitoring of immunization coverage were also included and represent a 1.039 percent increase over the FY 20 22 estimate: FY 2019 Estimated Costs = FY 2017 cost plus 3.9 percent FY 20 20 Estima ted Costs = FY 2018 cost plus 1.0 percent FY 20 21 Estimated Costs = FY 2019 cost plus 1.0 percent FY 20 22 Estimated Costs = FY 20 20 cost plus 1.0 percent FY 20 23 Estimated Costs = FY 20 21 cost plus 1.0 percent For FY 2023, $183,915,255 is estimated for immunization costs, and $151,153 for immunization monitoring costs, for a total of $184,066,408 estimated for all immunization expenditures. This represents a $63,417,996 in crease from the FY 20 22 estimate attributable to changes in vaccine costs including a dministering COVID-19 immunizations, shifting population sizes among age categories targeted for immunization, and progress towards immunization coverage goals aligned with Healthy People 2030 targets (i.e., fewer individuals still needing vaccination whic h translates to reduced forecasted costs) . Calculations for the costs included as part of the FY 2023 estimated immunization costs were based on the assumptions outlined in the table below: Estimated User Population (FY 2020)\u00b6 Coverage Goal Current Coverage* No. to be vaccinated Vaccine costs (per dose) ** Admin fee (per dose) \u00a7 No. of doses per patient Total Immun . expenditures per patient Total Infants, 2 NA 47,643 Costs $184,066,408 \u00b6Reflects the most current user population counts available.

CJ - 278*Coverage estimates based on most current coverage levels available (FY 20 22 Quarter 1); coverage estimates for diabetics ages 19 - 59 years includes those patients immune to Hepatitis B for rea sons other than immunization ; HPV estimate is based on 3 dose series ; coverage listed as 'NA' either not applicable due to age- related cohort turnover each year or recurring annual immunization requirement each year (i.e., influenza). **Cost per dose for routine childhood vaccines administered up to and including age 18 are covered by the Vaccines for Children program; c ost per dose determined from the CDC Adult Vaccine Price List dated April 1, 2022. Lowest published price is generally used where multiple products or formulations are available. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/awardees/vaccine -management/price -list/index.html \u00a7Vaccine administration fees for all vaccines except COVID -19 vaccines are based on an average of CMS 2022 locality -adjusted payment amounts for administration of influenza vaccines as a proxy for all vaccines, except for COVID -19. COVID -19 vaccine administration costs are based on Medicare reimbursement rates specific to COVID- 19 immunization for any vaccine doses. Due to the evolving COVID -19 vaccine landscape, estimates are preliminary and may not be reliable. Overall, the estimated costs above reflect projected cos ts for routine, on -schedule immunizations but with caveats : 1. Other i ndividuals outside these core patient groups are regular recipients of immunizations (e.g., immunization for health care workers and those at specific risk for other vaccine -preventable dis eases) . However, there is not currently a methodology to estimate the size of these groups to effectively track vaccination coverage rates . 2. CMS reimbursement rates for vaccine administration were used to estimate indirect costs because the re is no specific methodology to estimate indirect costs or administrative overhead associated with the administration of immunizations system - wide , or operation of the overall immunization program.

Current Law: Sequestration is the legislatively mandated process of budget control consisting of automatic, across-the-board spending reductions to enforce budget targets to limit federal spending . It was first established by the Balance d Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA, Title II of P.L. 99-177, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 900- to BBEDCA ( 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 905) identifie s programs that are exempt from sequestration, and Section 256 of BBEDCA (2 U.S.C. \u00a7 906) establishes special rules. While 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 906(e) ostensibly sets IHS's discretionary funding sequester level to 2% of its total, Section 251A( 5), Implementing Discr etionary Reductions, does not apply the special rules of Section 256; they are only used in Implementing Direct Spending Reductions (Section 251A(6)), which results in reductions i n IHS's discretionary accounts on the same basis as other nonsecurity accounts. Inclusive of the 2% sequestered from the mandatory Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI, limited to a 2% reduction), a total of $2.5 million was sequestered from IHS's budget, which was 5.1% of the resources appropriated in FY 2013 for Indian health programs. Rationale: All programs administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs are exempt from a sequestration reduction ordered under the BBEDCA and the BCA. Through this exemption Congre ss expressly indicated how critical it is for services provided by the VA not to be disrupted or reduce d as a result of sequestration. Section 255 of BBEDCA (codified at 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 905) identifies programs that are exempt from sequestration. These include programs providing critical support to vulnerable groups within the United St ates, including children (Children's Heal th Insurance Program (CHIP), Child Nutrition Programs, and foster care) and low income persons/families (Medicaid, TANF, Family Support Programs), health benefits to retirees, vetera ns and service memb ers (Veterans Affairs, Annuitants, Employee s Health Benefits, Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund, Medical Benefits for Commissioned Officers, Public Health Service). Many of the exempted programs reimburse the IHS for services rendered including Medicaid, Medicare (treated under special limiting rules), CHIP, and Veterans Health program reimbursement. The services provided by the IHS are no less critical. Budget reductions of any kind have implications for the service s IHS, Tribe s, and Urba n Indian organizations provide to American Indian and Alaska Native patients and communit ies. I n FY 2013, these reductions resulted in dramatic oversight and administration reductions to maintain service levels, limitations to patients being able to see outsi de specialists beyond Priority 1 (emergent or acutely urgent care), and reductions to services paid for throu gh offsetting collections. Future sequesters would not only damage the lives and health of American Indians and Alaska Natives through reduced direct services a nd care, it woul d also impair IHS's efforts to improve medic al quality , implement improvements/replacement to its Electronic Health Record System, and reduce critical health care staffing vacancies among other impacts. CJ - 284The impact of a sequestration on the IHS will be highly variable, both based on the overall sequester level, interpretation of sequester policy (e.g., OMB's decision applying the 2% limitation only to the mandatory SDPI), as well as the availability of third party resources to ameliorate budget reductions to critical care areas. Additionally, the d ate in the fiscal year in which it is implemented will add to the effect of the impact. Notice earlier in the fiscal year would allow for a minimal impact, evenly reducing the reduction across 12 full months of the fiscal year, whereas later notice would i mpact operations more greatly. An illustrative example is included below to demonstrate the impact of a sequestration on IHS. For the purposes of calculating the following estimate, a sequestration reduction percentage to IHS programs (excepting the SDPI program, which is capped at 2 percent) is assumed to be 7.5 percent, in the range of modest reduction levels, applied equally across IHS programs, projects or activities, as implemented in FY 2013. Using FY 2016 performance results as the base, a reduction of $267.5 million would be taken from the IHS's Appropriation, which would result in estimated impacts over the following selected measures: Estimated Impact on Health Care Delivered by a National 7.5% Sequester Reduction Comprehensive Cardiovascular Disease Assessment Number Carried out in FY 2016 30,040 Sequester Reduction 2,253 Number of Patients Who Receive Depression Screening Number Carried out in FY 2016 515,692 Sequester Reduction 38,677 Number of Patients Who Receive Colorectal Cancer Screening Number Carried out in FY 2016 165,056 Sequester Reduction 12,379 Number of Patients Who Receive Alcohol Screening: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) Prevention Screening Number Carried out in FY 2016 205,952 Sequester Reduction 15,446 Number of Patients Who Receive Mammography Cancer Screening Number Carried out in FY 2016 55,808 Sequester Reduction 4,186 Number of AI/AN patients (age 19-35 months) who have received the combined childhood vaccination series Number Carried out in FY 2016 63,423 Sequester Reduction 4,757 Number of AI/AN patients (ages 18+) who have received the influenza vaccine CJ - 285Number Carried out in FY 2016 515,692 Sequester Reduction 38,677 Number of AI/AN patients who have received dental services Number Carried out in FY 2016 1,093,321 Sequester Measurement Explanation https://www.ihs.gov/crs/includes/themes/newihstheme/display_objects/documents/crsv16/GPRA MeasuresV161.pdf Budget Impact: While resulting in no change to IHS's funding, this proposal would increase the amount of sequestered funding taken from remaining non-exempt agencies. Effective Date: Upon enactment. CJ - 286Indian Health Service U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Officers to be Detailed to Urban Indian Organizations to Cooperate In or Conduct Work Related to the Functions of the Department of Health and Human Services Proposal : Amend federal law to permit U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Officers (officers) to be detailed directly to Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) to cooperate in or conduct work related to the functions of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Current Law : Current federal law permits HHS to detail officers or employees of the Public Health Service for particular enumerated purposes to spe cified entities, including State health authorities and certain nonprofit institutions (subsections (b) and (c) of section 214 of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) (42 U.S.C. 215(b), (c)). This legislative proposal is limited to seeking authority to det ail only officers to UIOs. Although UIOs are nonprofit organizations, section 214(c) of the PHSA (42 U.S.C. 215(c)) only authorizes details to nonprofit institutions engaged in health activities for special studies of scientific problems and for the dissem ination of information related to public health. Because UIOs do not meet those restrictions, officers cannot be detailed directly to an UIO. The authority to detail an officer to State health authorities has been interpreted to authorize an indirect placement with an UIO by detailing an officer to a State health authority which may then designate the UIO as the officer's duty station. UIOs are part of the Indian health care system and provide health care services to eligible American Indians and Alask a Natives residing in urban centers. Rationale : The Indian Health Service (IHS) enters into limited, competing contracts and grants with 41 501(c)(3) non -profit organizations to provide health care and referral services for Urban Indians throughout the United States. UIOs are defined in section 4(29) of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) (25 U.S.C. 1603(29)) as a nonprofit corporate body situated in an urban center, governed by an urban Indian controlled board of directors, and providing for th e maximum participation of all interested Indian groups and individuals, which body is capable of legally cooperating with other public and private entities for the purpose of performing the activities described in section 503(a) of that Act (25 U.S.C. 1653(a)). UIOs provide unique access to culturally appropriate and quality health care for Urban Indians. UIOs have requested that officers be detailed to them to fill many roles related to the functions of HHS, however, section 214 of the PHSA (42 U.S.C. 215) prevents IHS from detailing officers directly to UIOs. Subsection (b) of that section (42 U.S.C. 215(b)) has been interpreted as allowing IHS to detail an officer to a State health authority, which may then designate the UIO as the officer's duty station. The officer is authorized to perform work at an UIO that is related to the functions of HHS, which has been interpreted to include health care services and supportive functions. The process for such indirect details is completely dependent on the availability of a State or local health authority that is capable and willing to enter into such an arrangement. The process can be burdensome and time consuming for all involved, and State health authorities may be reluctant because of this burden, as wel l as their potential liability under such an arrangement. CJ - 287Amending the law would provide IHS the discretionary authority to detail officers directly to an UIO to perform work related to the functions of HHS, to the same extent it may do so now through the indirect, burdensome process described above. Such authority would be comparable to the existing authority to detail officers to Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) contractors and compactors for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of their ISDEAA contracts (section 7 of the Act of August 5, 1954 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2004b). This proposal aligns with the U.S. Public Health Service's goal to increase the number of officers. Currently, 1,614 officers of the U.S. Public Health Service are assigned to IHS. There are five officers assigned to States, whose duty stations are UIOs. See table below. Urban Facility Name, City, State #Officers Category Gerald L. Ignace Indian Health Center Milwaukee, Wisconsin 1 Pharmacy Native American Rehabilitation Association Portland, Oregon 2 Health Services Officer - Physician Assistant Pharmacy Oklahoma City Indian Clinic Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 3 Health Services Officer - Medical Technologist Pharmacy Therapist - Physical Strateg ic Objecti ve 1.3 in the HHS Strategic Plan addresses the need to im prove Americans' access to health ca re and expand choices of ca re and servic e opti ons.

Providi ng IHS authorit y to detail officers directl y to UIOs will help address the se shorta ges so that UIOs can provide health care services to eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) residing in urban centers. Budget Impact : This is a non-budget related proposal. P ersonne l Requirements : This proposa l doe s not re quire addit ional personne l to implement. Effective Date: Upon enactment. Equity Impact Assessment : Permitting officers to be detailed directly to UIOs will address the need to i mprove a ccess to health car e for AI /AN communities, who often experienc e unique challenges and barriers to care . Improvin g access to ca re by strengthenin g IHS workforce capacit y will contribut e to bette r outcomes for AI/AN , and reduc e health disparities. CJ - 288Indian Health Service Provide the Indian Health Service Discretionary Use of all Title 38 Personnel Authorities Proposal : The Indian Health Service (IHS) is seeking the discretionary use of all United States Code Title 38 authorities under Part V, Chapter 74, \"Veterans Health Administration - Personnel\", that are primarily available to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in relation to health care positions. The term \"health care occupations\" refers to positions, other than positions in the Senior Executive Service, that provide direct patient -care services or services incident to direct patient -care which would normally be covered by Title 5 of the United States Code. Current Law : Title 38 Part V, Chapter 74, governs all aspects of personnel administration for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) unless expressly overridden by another law or regulation. In many areas of personn el administration, the VHA is exempt from Title 5 laws and regulations by virtue of Title 38. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), under the authority of section 1104 and 5371 of Title 5 of the United States Code, has authorized the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to use the Title 38 provisions pertaining to pay rates and systems, premium pay, classification, and hours of work. This delegation of authority is described in a delegation of authority between OPM and HHS - the latest ver sion of which was effective March 6, 2019. If HHS, or an HHS Operating Division under the delegation of authority, chooses to use a Title 38 provision, the comparable authority under Title 5 is waived. However, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5371 does not provide authority to apply all personnel provisions of Title 38 in lieu of comparable Title 5 provisions. Rationale : The IHS, as a primarily rural health care provider, has difficulty recruiting health care professionals. The IHS has critical hiring needs for health care professionals in IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian programs including, but not limited to physicians, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. The ability to use Title 38 for pay purposes as noted above is beneficial becaus e the IHS can offer market pay to physicians, dentists, and podiatrists as well as special salary rates to individuals in other health care occupations. However, the IHS's use of these compensation authorities is not adequate by itself to compete with other public sector agencies and private sector organizations. Typically, the private sector and the VHA can offer candidates better scheduling options and paid time off \u2014 particularly important benefits to providers who serve in remote and rural locations. The IHS faces specific public sector competition in the area of annual leave accrual. The VHA provides 1 day of annual leave per pay period for all (including new) physicians, dentists, podiatrists, optometrists, and chiropractors and 8 hours of annual lea ve accrual per pay period for all (including new) nurses, physician assistants, and expanded -function dental auxiliaries. Due to the limited scope of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5371, the IHS does not have U.S.C. 7421. \"Personnel Administratio of absence of employees\". Thus, when a candidate with just a few years of experience is choosing between the IHS and the VHA, he or she will invariably choose the organization offering 1 day/8 hours of annual leave accrual per pay period, as opposed to just 4 or 6 hours of annual leave CJ - 289accrual per pay period that the IHS offers. Supervisors report anecdotally that the IHS has lost many candidates due to this difference in accrual rates. In addition to better scheduling options and paid time off, the IHS is seeking access to other Title 38 authorit ies to increase its competitive stance in the health care labor market and to create a more efficient and effective human resources program. This would include the potential for instituting two-year probationary periods for staff appointed under Title 38 and to have jurisdiction over appea ls for adverse actions involving professional conduct or competence pertaining to direct patient care and clinical competence instead of going through the Merit Systems Protection Board. Title 38 also exempts the VHA from collective bargaining and associa ted grievance procedure s relating to issues concerning professiona l conduct competence, and pee r review. I n contrast, Title 5 permits the establishment of grievance procedures on any issue through the collective bargaining process. Budget Impact: This proposal is budget neutral. The IHS will accommodate funding requirements within existing resources. Effective Date: Upon enactment. CJ - 290Indian Health Service Meet Loan Repayment/Scholarship Service Obligations on a Half-Time Basis Proposal : Permit both Indian Health Service (IHS) scholarship and loan repayment recipients to fulfill service obligations through half -time clinical practice, under authority similar to that now available to the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) Loan Repayment Program (LRP) and Scholarship Program. Authority similar to that provided in section 331(i) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254d(i)) would allow IHS loan repayment and scholarship recipients more options and flexibility to satisfy their service obligations through half -time clinical work (a minimum of 20 hours per week) for double the amount of service time (e.g., clinician who works 20 hours a week performing clinical duties with a two-year service obligation would increase to a four-year service obligation ) or to accept half the amount of loan repayment award in exchange for a two -year service obligation. This would provide parity with NHSC programs and enable IHS to make better use of these tools to recruit and retain key professionals in a highly competit ive environment. Current Law : Sections 104 and 108 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25 U.S.C. 1613a, 1616a) require employees who receive IHS scholarships or loan repayments to provide clinical services on a full-time basis. Section 331(i) of the Public Health Service Act was amended by section 10501(n) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law No. 111-148; 124 Stat. 1002)to permit certain NHSC loan repayment and scholarship recipients to satisfy their service obligations th rough half -time clinical practice for double the amount of time or, for NHSC loan repayment recipients, to accept half the loan repayment award amount in exchange for a two-year service obligation. Section 331(j) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C . 254d(j)) defines \"full -time\" clinical practice as a minimum of 40 hours per week, for a minimum of 45 weeks per year. It also defines \"half -time\" as a minimum of 20 hours per week (not to exceed 39 hours per week), for a minimum of 45 weeks per year. Rationale : The IHS, as a rural health care provider, has difficulty recruiting and retaining health care professionals. Recruiting physicians and other primary care clinicians has been especially challenging. Permitting IHS scholarship and loan repayment h ealth professional employees to fulfill their service obligations through half -time clinical practice for double the amount of time and to offer half the loan repayment award amount in exchange for a two-year service obligation could increase the number of providers interested in serving in the Indian health system. Additional half -time direct care employees could also reduce the number and cost of Purchased/Referred Care program referrals, especially at sites that do not need full-time specialty care services. There are also a number of smaller rural IHS sites where clinicians will be able to provide a minimum of half -time clinical services with the remainder of their time devoted to much needed administrative/management responsibilities. This proposal will provide flexibility for providers who might not otherwise consider service in IHS by allowing part -time practice in CJ - 291IHS to coincide with a part- time private practice , as well as part- time practice in IHS combined with part- time administrative duties within the IHS. The NHSA wa s authorized to establish a demonstration project permitting loan repayment recipients to meet their service obligations through less than full- time clinical service in response to re quests from clinician s and sites. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law No. 111-148; 124 Stat. 119) t replaced this demonstration with permanent authority for two specific kinds of NHSC options (described above unde r Curre nt Law). The IHS is equally concerned with the requests from clinicians and prospective candidates for loan repayment awards for half-time service by clinicians. Having similar authority as the NHSC would increase the ability for the IHS to recruit a nd retain health care cli nicians to provide primary health care and specialty services (e.g., Surgery, OG/GYN, Psychiatry, Radiology , and Anesthesiology) and other wise support the IHS and HHS prior ities. The ability to provide scholarship and loan repayment awards for half- time clinical service would make these recruitment and retention tools more flexible and cost-effective, providing incentives for an additional pool of clinicians a nd other medic al providers that otherwise may not consider a commitment to the IHS federal, Tribal, and Urba n Indian si tes. Having similar authority as the NHSC would increase the ability of the IHS to recruit a nd retain health care clinicians to provide primary health care and specialty service s and otherwise support the IHS and HHS priorities. Budget Impact: This is a budget neutral proposal. The IHS will accomodate funding requirements from within existing resources. D irect hire medical staff costs are lower than the costs to hire temporary, contractor staff. Effective Date: Upon enactment. Equity Impact Assessment: This proposal would increase IHS's ability to recruit and retain health care clinicians to provide primary health care and specialty services to American Indian/Alaska Native communities which disproportionately suffer from healthcare issues and lack the necessary clinical personnel to provide care to community members. The requested change will also foster equity between the IHS and NHSC loan repayment and scholarship programs which will incentivize clinicians to choose a career with IHS. CJ - 292 Indian Health Service Provide Tax Exemption for Indian Health Service Health Professions Scholarship and Loan Repayment Programs Proposal : The Indian Health Service (IHS) seeks tax treatment similar to that provided to recipients of scholarships and loan repayment from the National Health Service Corps (NHSC). The IHS seeks to allow scholarship funds for qualified tuition and related expenses received under the Indian Health Service Health Professions Scholarships to be excluded from gross income under section 117(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 19 86 (IRC) and to allow participants in the IHS Loan Repayment Program to exclude from gross income, payments made by the IHS Loan Repayment Program under section 108(f)(4) of the IRC. With the above exemptions, the IHS programs would also be exempt from any Federal Employment Tax (FICA), making the IHS programs comparable to the current NHSC status. Current Law: Generally, benefits in the form of scholarship awards and loan repayments are regarded as federal taxable income by the IRS under Title 25 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, three federal laws currently provide for the non -taxability of federal scholarship awards and loan repayment programs: 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 117(c)(2), provides that tuition, fee, and other related cost payments by the National Healt h Service Corps scholarships are not taxable. This tax exemption was made permanent by Congress in December 2012 but did not include IHS scholarships. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 108(f)(4) provides that funds received through the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayme nt Program authorized under 338B(g) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254l -1) or a state loan repayment program described in section 338I of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254q -1) are permanently not subject to federal income tax. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401(a)(19) excludes NHSC loan repayment from federal employment tax. As IHS programs are not included in the exceptions, IHS health professions scholarships and loan repayment awards are taxed under the IRC. Rationale : The IHS, as a rural healt h care provider, has difficulty recruiting and retaining health care professionals. There are over 1,330 vacancies for health care professionals including: physicians, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. The IHS Health Professions Scholarship Program and the Loan Repayment Program play a significant role in the recruitment and retention of the health care professionals needed to fill these vacancies. The IHS Health Professions Scholarship and IHS Loan Repayment Program are very similar to programs that receive preferred tax treatment, and should therefore receive similar tax treatment. Currently, benefits awarded through IHS in the form of loan repayment and scholarships are regarded as federal taxable income to the recipient; however, the same benefits offered under the NHSC are not taxable. This disparate tax treatment of IHS -funded scholarship and loan repayment awards increases the overall tax bracket for the participants and creates a financial CJ - 293 disincentive for those otherwise willing to serve American Indian and Alaska Native patients by working in Indian health facilities. The ability to exempt scholarship and loan repayment funds from gross income would make this recruitment and retention tool more attractive to potential participants. Based on IHS' calculations, exempting the IHS Loan Repayment Program would allow IHS to award an additional 190 loan repayment contracts in a given year. Thus, the IHS would be better able to increase the num ber of health care providers entering and remaining within the IHS to provide primary health care and specialty services. Budget Impact : Federal Tax Revenue Foregone (in 2019 dollars): Loan $8,920,705 Scholarship $188,773* Total $9,109,478 *Number indicates taxes withheld by IHS at recipient's request. Budget impact is the amount of tax revenue withheld by IHS from IHS Health Professions Scholarship and Loan Repayment and forwarded to the Internal Revenue Service. This also includes the tax liabili ty owed by the scholarship recipients. Effective Date : Upon enactment. Equity Impact Assessment : This proposal would increase IHS's ability to recruit and retain healthcare professionals to provide primary health care and specialty services to American Indian/Alaska Native communities which disproportionately suffer from healthcare issues and lack the needed clinical staff to treat community members. The requested change will also foster equity between the IHS and NHSC loan repayment and scholarship prog rams which will incentivize clinicians to choose a career with IHS. CJ - 294 Indian Health Service Waiver of Indian Preference Proposal : Amend Federal law to authorize the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary to waive Indian Preference laws, and issue related regulations, applicable to IHS positions that fall under specific conditions in order to fill positions in cases where the Secretary determines there is an urgent staffing crisis or chronic persistent vacancies in health professions. Problem : In August 2018, GAO reported that the IHS had a 25 percent vacancy rate for providers, including physicians, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, nurse practitioners, certified registered nurse anesthetists, certified nurse midwives, and physician assistants (GAO -18-580). This equates to over 1,400 current vacancies in IHS in these health professions. Long -standing vacancies have a negative effect on patient access, quality of care, and employee morale. IHS needs additional flexibilities t o rapidly address chronic staffing needs. While extremely important, Indian Preference sometimes impacts the Agency's ability to hire highly competent personnel for essential provider or facility Chief Executive Officer (CEO) positions (e.g., in circumstan ces when an Indian Preference candidate is qualified at only the most basic level, or where an Indian Preference candidate has poor references, a record of disciplinary issues in Federal employment, or both). Allowing the HHS Secretary to waive Indian Pref erence as proposed may help to mitigate the persistent vacancies experienced across the Agency and improve access to highly qualified providers and CEOs. Rationale : The proposal would allow the HHS Secretary to grant a waiver of the application of Indian Preference laws without the written waiver now required under section 2(c) of Public Law 96-135 (25 U.S.C. 5117(c)) from concerned tribal organizations, for any personnel action involving filling a vacant position at an IHS service unit in which 15 percent or more of the total positions or specific health profession positions in the service unit are not filled by a full -time employee of the IHS for a period of 6 months or longer. This flexibility will help IHS expedite recruitment and hiring for critical pr ovider positions or a CEO position at any facility that is not able to fill vacancies for an extended period of time under the Indian Preference laws. Also, it can be impractical to obtain a Tribal waiver, as is currently required, at locations where an IHS facility serves multiple Tribes, for example the IHS Rapid City Service Unit. The IHS will provide the Secretary adequate justification for the waiver when a situation at a facility meets the criteria. Budget Impact : IHS currently uses temporary contr actors, at 2-3 times the cost of federal staff, to fill vacancies. If the proposal is approved, significant cost savings may result as federal employees and commissioned officers would be used instead of contracted personnel. Effective Date : Upon enactment. Equity Impact Assessment : This proposal to waive Indian Preference requirements under limited, urgent situations will enable IHS to hire and retain mission -critical healthcare staff to CJ - 295 provide healthcare to people in American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities who disproportionately suffer from serious health issues and a shortage of needed healthcare providers. The requested change will allow IHS to hire the best qualified candidates and fill critical staffing shortages to ensure the highest quality of care for patients. CJ - 296 Indian Health Service Withhold Annuity and Retiree Pay for Retired Civil Service Employees Convicted of Moral Turpitude Proposal : Amend Federal law to allow for withholding or revoking of annuity and retiree pay for retired civil service employees convicted of moral turpitude, including crimes against children and rape, during the commission of their federal duties. Current Law : Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8312, a retired civilian employee's annuity and retiree pay may only be withheld for specific high crimes of treason, aiding the enemy, perjury, and subordination of perjury. The federal government needs additional authorities to address the pay of retirees who commit certain egregious and reprehensible crimes that outrage and offend the American Public's moral sensibility. Expansion of the list of offenses minimally should include crimes against children and rape perpetrated by federal employees during the commission of their federal duties, on federal property, or while otherwise using their federal position. Rationale : In September 2018, a former U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officer and civil service employee at the IHS was convicted of sexual assault and exploitation of children for crimes committed while an active duty Corps officer assigned to the IHS facility in Browning, Montana. In September 2019, the same individual was convicted on additional charges in South Dakota for similar allegations while assigned to the IHS facility in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, and the case was appealed in February 2020. The sexual assailant's conviction exposes the limitations of current statute to fully address and adjudicate crimes of moral turpitude committed by retired federal employees during the commission of their duties while in the federal civil service. In keeping with the limited scope of current law, e.g., 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8312, the proposed amendment may be limited to the commission of crimes against children and rape, specifically while on duty, on federal property, or while using or misusing the authority of their federal position. This proposed amendment is in line with the Department's mission of protecting vulnerable, underserved populations, and the Presidential Task Force on Protecting Native American Children in the Indian Health Service System. Budget Impact : None. Effective Date : Upon enactment. Equity Impact Assessment : This proposal will promote equity of treatment against convicted perpetrators of egregious crimes in regards to receipt of federal retirement benefits. The American Indian/Alaska Native population is already a vulnerable and underserved population, and this proposal seeks to deny retirement benefits to those who harm children, who are the most defenseless members of this population. There are restrictions in most states' laws preventing or CJ - 297 limiting the receipt of a state pension for convicted felons and this proposal would make federal pensions more consistent with this model. CJ - 298 Indian Health Service Provide the Indian Health Service with legislative authority to conduct mission -critical emergency hiring needs beyond 30 -day appointments Proposal : The Indian Health Service (IHS) seeks a legislative change to meet staffing needs during emergency situations. The change requested is to allow for a 60 -day critical hiring need appointment authority with the possibility of a 60 -day extension. In addition, the maximum number of days an employee is authorized to work in 12 months would be increased from 60 to 120 days. Current Law : Under 5 CFR 213.3102(i)(2) agencies can appoint individuals for 30 days under an excepted service 30 -day critical hiring need appointment. This type of appointment can be extended for up to 30 days if c ontinued employment is essential to the agency's operations. The individual may not be employed for more than 60 days in 12 months. This regulation is for both senior -level and lower -level positions general schedule employees. Rationale : Critical hiring o ccurs when an agency needs to fill positions to meet agency requirements brought on by natural disasters, emergencies, or threats. IHS has previously used this hiring authority to fill positions in nursing, facility management, radiology, and many other critical areas to ensure the operation of IHS facilities and quality patient care. In March 2020, the COVID -19 public health emergency emerged. This increased IHS' use of this hiring authority. The health care industry took a significant hit during the pandemic and staff shortages were a constant issue. Furthermore, the pandemic disproportionately affected American Indian and Alaska Natives across the country further stressing IHS hospitals and clinics and requiring the need for additional emergency hires. To provide adequate services to staff health care facilities, emergency hires should have longer appointments, specifically 60 days instead of 30, with extensions possible for 60 days. This makes sense operationally and from a resource point of view. The effort to hire an individual, onboard them, and vet them through the pre -clearance and background investigation process is significant. To expend agency resources, both human and monetary, to hire someone for only 30 days is no longer the most viable solution to address staffing needs. Budget Impact : This proposal is budget neutral. The IHS will accommodate funding requirements within existing resources. Effective Date : Upon enactment. Equity Impact Assessment : This proposal will enable the Indian Health Service to recruit short - term emergency staff to provide, or support the provision of, healthcare to people in American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities who disproportionately suffer from serious health issues and a shortage of needed h ealthcare providers. By lengthening the period of time for critical hiring need appointments access to care will be strengthened, and as a result, better health care outcomes for American Indians and Alaska Natives will be achieved. CJ - 299 Impact on Other Agencies : None. CJ - 300 Indian Health Service Provide the Indian Health Service with permanent authority to hire and pay experts/consultants Proposal : The Indian Health Service (IHS) needs the ability to hire experts/consultants to address challenging tasks in a particular field beyond the usual range of achievement of competent persons (5 CFR 304.102(d)). An expert/consultant can also provide valuable and pertinent advice generally drawn from a high degree of broad administrative, professional, or technical knowledge or experience. (5 CFR 304.102(b)). Unlike most other Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Operating Divisions and Staff Divisions, the IHS does not have a permanent authority via the 1993 appropriations law to hire expert/consultants and pay rates not to exceed the daily rate equivalent to the maximum rate payable for senior -level positions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a75376.2. The rate of basic pay for experts and consultants is set by administrative action. An agency must d etermine the appropriate rate of basic pay on an hourly or daily basis. Since experts/consultants are not general schedule employees, they are automatically covered by locality payments 5 U.S.C. 5304 and 5 CFR part 531, subpart 5. The pay may not exceed th e GS -15 step 10. IHS had a temporary authority through the FY 2020 annual appropriations bill; however, that authority has expired. Current Law: Agencies may appoint experts and consultants temporarily (i.e., not to exceed one year) or on an intermittent basis (i.e., without a regularly scheduled tour of duty). These employees are not covered by the standard provisions related to an appointment in the competitive service (5 CFR part 332), position classification (5 U.S.C. chapter 51), or General Schedule pay-setting (5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter III). According to HHS Instruction 304-1: Appointment of Experts and Consultants, the Department of Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2020 (Public Law 116 -94 div. D (Dec. 20, 2019)), authorized IHS to set pay for services authorized by 5 U.S.C. \u00a73109 at rates not to exceed the daily rate equivalent to the maximum rate payable for senior -level positions under 5 U.S.C. \u00a75376.2. Since the end of FY 2020, IHS has not had an identif ied appropriation authority or other statute using 5 U.S.C. \u00a73109, per 5 U.S.C. \u00a73109(b). Rationale : Hiring experts and consultants is another tool IHS can use to strengthen its workforce and better serve the American Indian/Alaska Native population. Thes e highly specialized individuals can bring added skills, knowledge, and expertise to meet mission -critical tasks. To combat future pandemics, emergencies, and unique health -care challenges, it would be beneficial to hire experts/consultants to provide addi tional high -level resources to the IHS unavailable within the current workforce. The IHS is at a disadvantage by not hiring experts/consultants that could temporarily provide specialized advice or assistance with projects or planning on a temporary or int ermittent basis. IHS could benefit from experts/consultants by: 1. Gaining specialized diversity of thought needed to solve complex issues or perform tasks. CJ - 301 2. Obtaining advice from experts/consultants in their field of study. 3. Hiring experts/consultants from leading universities and colleges to advise on health care 4. Completing short -term mission -critical projects. 5. Filling short -term, high level positions with experts/consultants temporarily, which can be an efficient mechanism as well as a cost savings to the agency. Budget Impact : This proposal is budget neutral. The IHS will accommodate funding requirements within existing resources. Effective Date : Upon enactment of legislative authority and the creation of a new HR system. Equity Impact Assessment : This proposal will enable the Indian Health Service to appoint experts and consultants to support the provision of healthcare to people in AI/AN communities who disproportionately suffer from serious health issues and a shortage of need ed healthcare providers. By authorizing the use of experts and consultants, IHS can strengthen operations and patient care, and as a result, achieve better health care outcomes for American Indians and Alaska Natives. Impact on Other Agencies : None. CJ - 302 Indian Health Service Provide the Indian Health Service (IHS) with an on -call pay authority through a revision to premium pay provisions under Title 5 of the United States Code (USC) Proposal : The Indian Health Service (IHS) needs to be able to provide on -call pay to its health care staff under the premium pay system authorized under Title 5 of the United States Code. This will enable IHS to compensate clinical staff who agree to be on call and to achieve adequate on - site staffing levels when responding to fluctuating patient care demands. Current Law : IHS uses the premium pay provisions under Title 5 of the USC to compensate employees for working extended hours (overtime pay) or for working at certain times such as at night, on Sundays or on holidays. Premium pay is paid under Title 5 legal and regulatory provisions and is subject to biweekly and annual aggregate pay limitations, under 5 U.S.C. chapter 55, subchapter V and 5 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 550, subpart A. Current Title 5 premium pay law does not allow for on-call pay. By comparison, a major pay feature used by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and nonfederal health care employers is the ability to provide on -call premium pay to health -care staf f. Under the VA's Title 38 premium pay provisions, on -call pay is paid at ten percent of the employee's overtime rate. This type of premium pay is provided when an employee is scheduled to be on call outside of working hours in the event that the employer needs to call the employee back to the work site to provide health -care services. During the on - call period, the employee must remain ready to work and must carry a cell phone or other device in order to be easily contacted in the event the work site need s his or her services. If the employee is called back to the work site, he or she is provided, at a minimum, two hours of overtime pay or more if the employee needs to work on site longer than two hours. The ability to have employees be on call allows the VA to quickly adjust its on -site staffing and is ultimately a cost-savings measure since there is no need to schedule additional staff on-site at their full regular or overtime rate just to prepare for the possibility of increased patient care demands. On- call pay is also a standard pay option in nonfederal health care facilities that are not bound by federal pay regulations. Rationale : The IHS is the principal federal health care provider and health advocate for American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN s). The IHS provides comprehensive health services for over 500 federally recognized tribes and serves over two million AI/ANs located across 37 states every year. For various budgetary and administrative reasons, IHS has not adopted the full suite of premium pay provisions available under the delegated Title 38 pay authorities which allow for the payment of on -call premium pay. IHS often competes with the VA and nonfederal employers for needed allied health staff, and IHS's inability to pay on -call pay is a major recruitment and retention challenge. CJ - 303 The success of the IHS clinical mission rests on the ready availability of the appropriate clinical staff who can best address patient needs. To achieve this, IHS needs to be able to compensa te employees who are on call, with formally agreed -upon on -call restrictions in place such as continued proximity to the work site, carrying a cell phone, and remaining in a ready and able to work physical condition. A legislative change to the Title 5 pre mium pay provisions would place IHS on more equal footing with the VA and nonfederal employers of clinical staff that can already provide on-call pay to staff. Budget Impact : This proposal is budget neutral. The IHS will accommodate funding requirements within existing resources. Effective Date : Upon enactment. Equity Impact Assessment : This proposal will enable the IHS to hire and retain mission -critical healthcare staff to provide healthcare to people in AI/AN communities who disproportionately suffer from serious health issues and a shortage of needed healthcare providers. It will enable IHS to better manage its healthcare staff by compensating employees who serve on call. The requested change will make the level of care provided to AI/AN people more on par with care provided to the country's veterans by the VA. Impact on Other Agencies : None.

L. No.) 93 -638, as amended, which recognizes the unique legal and political relationship between the United States and Amer ican Indian and Alaska Native peoples. Accordingly, the IHS supports Tribal sovereignty: (1) by assisting Tribes in exercising their right to administer the IHS health programs, or portions thereof, and (2) by continuing to directly provide services to Tri bes that choose the IHS as their health care provider. A Tribal decision to enter or not enter into ISDEAA agreements are equal expressions of self -determination. Title I Contracts and Title V Self -Governance Compacts - Titles I and V of the ISDEAA provide Tribes the option to exercise the right to self -determination by assuming control and management of programs previously administered by the federal government. Since 1975, the IHS has entered agreements with Tribes and Tribal organizations to plan, conduc t, and administer programs authorized under Section 102 of the Act. Today, over $6.2 billion of the Agency's appropriation is transferred to Tribes and Tribal Organizations through Title I contracts and Title V compacts. Under Title I, there are 244 Tribes and Tribal Organizations operating 254 contracts and annual funding agreements. Under Title V, IHS is party to 105 compacts and 131 funding agreements; through which approximately $2. 6 billion of the IHS budget is transferred to Tribes and Tribal organiza tions. Sixty -six percent of federally recognized Tribes participate in Title V.

CJ - 310 3. Modernize Enterprise IT Services for Cloud and Cybersecurity The proposed project will support the acquisition and implementation of cloud capabilities for the IHS enterprise infrastructure that will support the IHS Health Information Technology (HIT) modernization initiative. Leveraging cloud computing capabilities will enable the IHS to leverage five essential characteristics of cloud computing: on- demand IT services, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured services, community health department, and a full array of ancillary and support services. Budget Allocation FY 2022 Projects 1. Improve IT Service Management Maturity This project will mature the cloud capabilities of IHS Health Information Technology (HIT) systems and improve Information Technology (IT) services that support direct patient care. IHS medical providers use IHS IT and HIT systems a 2. Lifecycle Replacement of Critical Hardware This project continues replacing end of life network and data center hardware critical to HIT services that support medical providers. IHS has thousands of devices operating beyond the lifecycle that are not covered by warranties or service agreements and cannot be updated against cybersecurity threats. This project is part of a multi- year strategy to improve lifecycle management of all IHS hardware. 3. Cybersecurity Operations Center This project will create a dedicated lab space with specific tools and equipment needed to perform several mission essential functions that aid in HHS and OIG investigations. Some of these functions include malware analysis, eDiscovery and research. This facility will give the incident responders the ability to correlate data from various sources and determine if a critical system has been impacted; provide remediation efforts and support system owners in data/system recovery. 4. HIT Project 2: Advancing Interoperability of Health Information The Interoperability project objective is to develop strategies, inclu ding the development and/or acquisition of solutions in response to the HHS requirements of the 21st Century Cures Act. IHS is required to comply with HHS mandates for Certified Health Information Technology (CHIT). Current annual appropriations are not provided at sufficient levels to support the breadth and depth of work required to maintain the current system and development work required to meet the 21st Century Cures Act program mandates. 5. Developing and implementing supporting technology standardizati on through a planned Enterprise Architecture While efforts are underway to transform the IHS IT and HIT major systems, ancillary and tertiary systems which provide data to major systems may also need to be upgraded or replaced. This effort would use contracted support to work to identify, develop, and implement guidance and standards for hardware and software for supporting systems in the IHS ensure technological and data sharing compatibility as well as uniformity in the IHS environment. The effort wou ld create a holistic view of the endpoint systems which feed major data repositories to eliminate \"islands of data\" which require manipulation to be consumed into major systems. The effort would examine and promulgate guidance for all systems ranging from user endpoints such as PC's and tablets to infrastructure components such as routers and switches and Wi-Fi connectivity and include network connected medical devices such as medical laboratory and diagnostic devices. CJ - 311 Budget Allocation FY 2021 Projects Total: $ 194 million 1. ITOPS Project 2: Modernize Enterprise IT Services $3.5 million This project will mature the cloud capabilities of IHS Health Information Technology (HIT) systems and improve Information Technology (IT) services that support direct patient care. IHS medical providers use IHS IT and HIT systems as fundamental tools in raising the physical, mental, social, and spiritual health of American Indian and Alaska Native people. This project is a high priority requirement on the roadmap to modernize the IHS electronic health record system, satisfies multiple Inspector General recommendations, and achieves Department data center consolidation goals. Expanding cloud capabilities enhances the cybersecurity capabilities of IHS and HIT systems and a llows IHS to centralize and consolidate IT services. 2. ITOPS Project 4: Improve IT Service Management Maturity $2 million Building on ITOPS Project 3, this project will mature the IT Service Management (ITSM) capabilities of IHS and improve IT and HIT services that support medical providers, which are fundamental to raising the physical, mental, social, and spiritual health of American Indian and Alaska Native people. Building on the capabilities of the IHS ServiceNow platform, this project will improve cust omer experience and increase the quality of IT services provided by IHS. ITSM is fragmented in IHS because each of the 12 Areas and Headquarters operate separate IT budgets and have procured disparate ITSM tools and processes over the years. This project delivers consistent processes and centralizes ITSM capabilities to improve IHS IT services. This project also allows the IHS to develop a centralized capability to assist in stronger cybersecurity management of IHS IT and HIT systems. 3. ITOPS Project 6: Lif ecycle Replacement of Critical Hardware $2 million Building on ITOPS Project 5, this project will replace end of life network and data center hardware critical to HIT services that support medical providers, which are fundamental to raising the physical, mental, social, and spiritual health of American Indian and Alaska Native people. IHS has thousands of devices operating beyond the lifecycle that are not covered by warranties or service agreements and cannot be updated against cybersecurity threats. This project is part of a multi- year strategy to improve lifecycle management of all IHS hardware. Facilities Budget Allocation FY 2023 1. Fort Duchesne Health Center Modernization The Fort Duchesne PHS Indian Health Center Renovations project is intended to modernize the building's mechanical, electrical, plumbing, security and information technology systems, and reconfigure the space allocation within the healthcare facility to address current healthcare needs. This amount is in addition to the $3.5 million in FY 2022 NEF resources, and will complete the project. 2. Crow 18- Unit Apartment Building The NEF funds will be used to construct an 18-Unit apartment building in Crow Agency, Montana. In 2019, the Program Justification Document for Quarters (PJDQ) was approved to justify the need for additional staff quarters at the Crow Service Unit. The project has been designed and is ready for construction, but the project has been delayed due increased construction costs related to the CJ - 312COVID -19 Pandemic. The PJDQ identifies the shortage of living quarters within the area and that shortage limits IHS' ability to hire and retain staff. The project will expand the availability of l iving quarters at the remote location, which enables the Service Unit to hire and house the needed staff for delivering adequate health care. This project has not received NEF resources, and these funds will complete the project. 3. Rapid City Health Center Priority Health Project Funds will be used to equip the health care facility to replace the Sioux San Hospital with a new 137,391sf ambulatory care center. This facility will improve access to medical care as well as improve the collaboration and partnership between the Great Plains Tribes and the IHS. The new health care facility will provide an expanded outpatient department, community health department, and a full array of ancillary and support services. This facility began construction in September 2019. This amount is in addition to the $29.5 million in FY 2016 NEF resources, and will continue the project.
