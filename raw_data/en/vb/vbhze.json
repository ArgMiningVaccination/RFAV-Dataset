Video at the bottom of the page [here](http://www.steinermentary.com/SM/Steinerific-Star_Wars.html), essay [here](http://cosmicconvergence.org/?p=12888). (It's a Mayan apocalypse and wholesale conspiracy website, I don't know why.) It's a pretty fantastic tale and the 40-minute interview is highly recommended. Then in the 1980s, he began [conversations](http://cosmicconvergence.org/?p=14170)with Kathleen Kennedy and influenced every Indy movie so far. The next round of questions focused principally on the Ark of the Covenant. Where is it? Was it real? What were its powers? What was it made of? Are there authentic pictures of it? Who stole it? What did the Templars have to do with it? Do the Jews have one now and, if so, where is it? Did the Queen of Sheba take it back to Ethiopia? We discussed the alleged crystal skulls from South America, Shiva stones from India, the wish-fulfilling stone of Vajrayogini, magic crystals from Atlantis and Lemuria, the secret Halls of Wisdom beneath the Great Pyramid, the tomb of the first Emperor of China, and many other similar stories. Here is the vision I shared with her: There needs to be three knights who go to Jerusalem to find the grail. They are tasked with bringing it to the West and guarding it until the time comes for a \"chosen one\" to cross the bridge of death between the physical and spiritual, and reach the holy shrine of the grail carved in solid stone. Hide the grail in plain sight, so only the \"pure of heart\" knows which of the many grails is the one and only grail, the cup that Christ used at the Last Supper. This cup is humble and anyone who drinks from it lives forever. He was paid for his consultation. Probably he was recorded and transcribed as was procedure.I also shared with her the \"truth\" about the caves in South America that Blavatsky said were lined with gold and home to the masters. This was in the form of a long story called \"Sun Seed,\" about a seeker who finds his way to these caves and what he encounters there, as well as its relationship to sunspots and the shifting of the poles. Twelve masters must meet in the cave to create a new Ark that will keep the earth from great physical upheavals. Oh, and the history of Helena Blavatsky inspired Poltergeist. (mic drop) "}
