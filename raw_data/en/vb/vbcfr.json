Dr. Jennifer Dillaha with the Arkansas Department of Health said antibodies are proteins produced by our immune system. Each one attaches to a specific protein in a virus or bacteria, which creates an immune response that blocks it from being able to attach to human cells and reproduce.", "sitename": "KATV", "date": "2021-02-07", "cleaned_text": "lab-created antibodies could treat COVID-19 by Parris Kane SEATTLE, WA - DECEMBER 11: Dr. Jesse Erasmus checks a serum sample he diluted under a microscope in a microbiology lab at the University of Washington School of Medicine on December 11, 2020 in Seattle, Washington. The serum samples were collected from animals that received a replicon, or replicating, RNA vaccine that's being developed to combat Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2). Scientists are hoping this nucleic acid vaccine will only need one dose to be effective against the coronavirus and that it won't need to be stored in a deep freeze. This replicon RNA vaccine has been tested on mice and macaque monkeys and is in early stage clinical development with HDT Bio who will be leading the clinical trials of it in the United States. The serum samples Dr. Erasmus is working on will help determine the quantity of neutralizing antibodies. (Photo by Karen Ducey/Getty Images) "}
