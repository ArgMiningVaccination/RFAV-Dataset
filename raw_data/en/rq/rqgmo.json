He is now offering meditation sessions in Clearwater. Having worked with hundreds of people inquiring into the nature and experience of meditation, his goal is to help each client find that inner peace and happiness\u2014their birthright. He works with young and old, experienced and beginners, religious and spiritual as well as secularly oriented seekers. In integral awareness meditation, Castellani leads those with experience in meditation beyond the doing of meditative practices to the experience of meditation as the pure consciousness of inner peace and happiness. One will discover that meditation is an effortless abiding in one's true nature as pure consciousness, not a stressful practice of concentration or mindful attention. Today, many people won't try meditation or they lose touch with their meditation thinking it's another thing to \"do\" rather than recognizing it as a state of being/awareness, which awakens the heart of consciousness to one's essential self as inner peace and happiness, love and freedom. It is not an action or means to get something that you do not already have. Integral awareness meditation is the whole you\u2014the fulfillment we all seek.
