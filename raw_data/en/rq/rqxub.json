The Magic Eightball on Commercial Vaccines Novavax: Course change from Novavax: \"T o ensure both the necessary quantities of vaccine as well as timely vaccine delivery for their updated COVID -19 vaccines, Novavax has altered their plans and will offer their commercial vaccine in 5 -dose multidose vials instead of single dose vials.\" \"T o address and mitigate concerns about vaccine wastage, Novavax will be implementing 100% returns of vaccine, for both opened and unopened vials at their current contract price.\" 32 Grey text indicates that this may change.

Vaccine Clinical Update Priyanka Saxena, D.O., CDPH 36COVID -19 2020 2021 2022 2023Archived: ACIP Meeting CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Occurred on August 3, 2023 Topic: Respiratory Syncytial Virus - Nirsevimab Updates Evidence to Recommendation Summary Implementation Considerations Clinical Considerations Meeting Materials 39 CDC Media Release : RSV NirsevimabTherapeutics Clinical Update Jessica deJarnette , M.D., MS, CDPH Update Summary: Findings 41Some of the most notable RCT s (random controlled tests) and real -world patient studies with data mostly from 2022 (exception being for 2 original RCT s EPIC -HR/EPIC -SR) found somewhere between 45% -89% RRR (relative risk reduction) in prevention of severe COVID -19 or death for those prescribed C19 therapeutics, with most being in the 50 -75% range. This seems to be irrespective of vaccination status. Previous infection is more complicated. However, results seem to be more favorable for elderly andimmunocompromised adults, adults with serious comorbidities, and particularly when started early on in disease course.42Study Dates Findings Oral Nirmatrelvir for High -Risk, Nonhospitalized Adults with Covid -19 (Original EPIC -HR study)July-Dec 2021 89% relative risk reduction for hospitalization or death in treatment group (high -risk only) Effect of Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (Paxlovid) on Hospitalization among Adults with COVID -19: an EHR -based Target Trial Emulation from N3C December 23, 2021 - December 31, 2022Estimate a 65% reduced odds of hospitalization among Paxlovid -treated patients within a 28 -day follow -up period, and this effect did not vary by patient vaccination status. Oral Nirmatrelvir and Ritonavir in Nonhospitalized V accinated Patients With 20191 December 2021 - 18 April 202245% RRR in all cause ER visits, hospitalizations, serious complications and deaths within 30 days in nMV -R group Hospitalization and Emergency Department Encounters for COVID -19 After Paxlovid Treatment \u2014 California, December 2021 -May 2022December 31, 2021 -May 26, 2022Hospitalizations or ED encounters for COVID -19-related illness during the 5 -15 days after Paxlovid dispensation occurred among <1% of over 5k patients . Effectiveness of Paxlovid in Reducing Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Mortality in High -Risk PatientsJan-Feb 2022 Paxlovid was independently associated with a significantly decreased risk for the composite of severe COVID -19 or mortality (HR=0.54). More effective in older patients, immunosuppressed patients, and patients with underlying neurological or cardiovascular disease 43Study Dates Findings Nirmatrelvir Use and Severe Covid the 2022 65+ older: 73% risk reduction hospitalization, reduction for death ; Vaccinated and 65+: 68% fewer hospitalizations Real-world effectiveness of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir use for COVID -19: A population -based cohort study in Ontario, CanadaApril 4 - Aug 31, 2022 NNT to prevent one case of severe COVID -19 was 62 , but varied across strata (32 vs 126 for higher vs lower risk) Efficacy and safety of Paxlovid in severe adult patients with SARS -Cov-2 infection: randomized controlled studyApril 10 -May 19, 2022 Paxlovid showed no significant reduction in the risk of all -cause mortality on day 28 and the duration of SARS -CoV-2 RNA clearance in hospitalized adult COVID -19 patients with severe comorbidities. Paxlovid Associated with Decreased Hospitalization Rate Among Adults with COVID -19 \u2014 United States, April - September 2022April-September 2022 Persons who were prescribed Paxlovid within 5 days of diagnosis had a 51% lower hospitalization rate within 30 days after diagnosis than those who were not (including among previously infected/vaccinated). Effectiveness of nirmatrelvir -ritonavir in preventing hospital admissions and deaths in people with COVID -19: a cohort study in a large US health -care systemApril 8 -Oct 7, 2022 Nirmatrelvir -ritonavir had effectiveness of 53\u00b76% (95% CI 6\u00b76 -77\u00b70) in preventing hospital admission or death within 30 days of a positive test for SARS -CoV-2, which increased to 79\u00b76% (33\u00b79 -93\u00b78) when nirmatrelvir -ritonavir was dispensed within 5 days of symptom onset. A subgroup of patients who received immediate treatment the day of their test, estimated effectiveness was 89.6%.Skilled Nursing Facility Populations 44 Despite their high risk, only 1 in 4 nursing home residents with COVID -19 had been treated with evidence -based antiviral treatments by the end of 2022. During the study period, there were 763,340 resident cases of COVID -19 and 136,066 residents treated for COVID -19 among 15,092 nursing homes, equating to an overall oral antiviral or monoclonal antibody treatment rate of 17.8% (95% CI, 17.4% -18.3%). By the end of 2022, 41.0% of facilities still had not reported any use.45Skilled Nursing Facility Populations Monoclonal Antibody and Oral Antiviral Treatment of SARS -CoV-2 Infection in US Nursing Homes | Infectious Diseases | JAMA | JAMA NetworkAfter adjustment, larger bed size, higher overall quality rating, greater direct care hours per resident -day, having an affiliated geriatrician, higher staff and resident vaccination rates, and greater mean resident age and acuity were positively associated with treatment use. Being for -profit and having higher shares of non - White race and Medicaid residents were significantly associated with lower probability of treatment use.Antiviral Resistance 46 Prevalence of Low -Frequency, Antiviral Resistance Variants in SARS - CoV-2 Isolates in Ontario, Canada, 2020 -2023 | Infectious Diseases | JAMA Network Open | JAMA NetworkLooked at prevalence of low -frequency variants in SARS -CoV-2 isolates from patient samples that could confer resistance to nirmatrelvir - ritonavir 78,866 SARS -CoV-2 isolates in 4 labs in Ontario, CA Mar 2020 -Mar 2023 from patients underwent next-generation sequencing, and low-frequency variants resistant to nirmatrelvir -ritonavir were very rare, only detected in 128 samples (0.16%).Upcoming: Challenges and Opportunities 47New NIH Test 2 Treat Program rolling out: Very little information as of yet; soft launch was 7/21 for English, 8/1 for Spanish. Will be meeting with their community engagement team to discuss how to support existing state telehealth program. Commercialization: Paxlovid EUA product = federal government purchased Paxlovid FDA Approved product = commercially available (soon) Very little information for therapeutics as of yet. More information likely Q4 2023. Upcoming: Challenges and Opportunities 48Paxlovid remains authorized under EUA to ensure continued access for all eligible patients to the U.S. government's supply of Paxlovid. Bridge Access Program (BAP): Federal government has stated that there is ample supply of federally purchased COVID -19 oral antiviral therapeutics, which will remain free until exhausted. Federal government will reassess the need for therapeutics into BAP later down the line. Insurances under DMHC should be free/reimbursable until November; after that, to be determined on each plan (most should cover) Medi -Cal Rx will be coveredVaccine Management Josh Pocus, My Turn, and Maria Volk, myCAvax 49I wish I could add a new My Turn location online, so I can create clinics.
