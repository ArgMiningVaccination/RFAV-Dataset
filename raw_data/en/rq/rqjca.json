The Indian Health Service (IHS) GPRA report includes measures for clinical prevention and treatment, quality of care, infrastructure, and administrative efficiency functions. The IHS Clinical Reporting System (CRS) is a Resour ce and Patient Management System (RPMS) software application designed for national reporting as well as Area Office and local monitoring of clinical GPRA and developmental measures. CRS was first released for Fiscal Year (FY) 2002 performance measures (as GPRA+) and is based on a design by the Aberdeen Area (GPRA2000). This manual contains the FY 20 11 clinical performance measure definitions and logic for the CRS 20 11 Version 11 .1 software. CRS is the reporting tool used by the IHS Office of Planning and Ev aluation to collect and report clinical performance results annually to the Department of Health and H uman Services and to Congress. Each year, an updated version of CRS software is released to reflect changes in the logic descriptions of the different den ominators and numerators. Additional performance measures may also be added. Local facilities can run reports as often as they want to and can also use CRS to transmit data to their Area. The Area Office can use CRS to produce an aggregated Area report for either annual GPRA or Area Director Performance reports. CRS produces reports on demand from local RPMS databases for both GPRA and developmental clinical measures that are based on RPMS data, thus eliminating the need for manual chart audits for evaluati ng and reporting clinical measures. To produce reports with comparable data across every facility, the GPRA measures definitions was \"translated\" into programming code with the assistance of cl inical subject matter experts. CRS uses predefined taxonomies t o find data items in the RPMS Patient Care Component (PCC) to determine if a patient meets the performance measure criteria. Taxonomies contain groups of codes (e.g., diagnoses or procedures) or site -specific terms. Each performance measure has one or more defined denominators and numerators. Administrative and clinical users can produce reports for selected measures at any time to: Identify potential data issues in their RPMS, i.e., missing or incorrect data Monitor their site's performance against past national performance and upcoming agency goals Clinical Rep orting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinical Measures Preface June 2011 iii Identify specific areas where the facility is not meeting the measure in order to initiate business process or other changes Quickly measure impact of process changes on performance measures Identify areas meeting or exceeding measures to provide lessons learned Users of the RPMS CRS include: Area Office and site quality improvement staff Compliance Officers GPRA coordinators Clinical staff, such as physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, and other provider s Area Office directors Any staff involved with quality assurance initiatives Staff who run various CRS reports Clinical Reporting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinical Measures Table of Contents June 2011 iv Table of Contents 1.0 About This Manual .................................................................................................. 1 2.0 Performance Measure Logic .................................................................................. 1 2.1 Performance Measure Logic Basics ............................................................ 1 2.1.1 CRS Denominator Definitions .......................................................................... 1 2.1.2 Performance Measure Logic Example ............................................................. 7 2.1.3 Age Ranges .................................................................................................... 9 2.1.4 Standa rd Health Care Codes ........................................................................... 9 2.2 Diabetes Related Measure Topics ............................................................. 10 2.2.1 Diabetes Prevalence ..................................................................................... 10 2.2.2 Diabetic ............................................................... 36 2.2.9 Diabetes: Access to Dental Services ............................................................. 40 2.3 Dental Measure Topics .............................................................................. 42 2.3.1 Access to Dental Services .............................................................................

Clinical Measures About This Manual June 2011 1 1.0 About This Manual This manual provides information on the performance measure logic used by the Clinical Reporting System ( CRS ) Version 11.1 Selected Measures (Local) Report (Fiscal Year [ FY] 2011 Clinical Performance Measures). For information on system setup, available reports and steps for running the reports, and performing Area Office functions, refer to the CRS Version 11. 1 User Manual. Clinical Reporting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic June 2011 1 2.0 Performance Measure Logic This section provides the following information for each performance measure topic: For Government Performance and Results Act ( GPRA ) measures, the measure description is provided as stated in the Indian Health Service ( IHS) Annual Performance Report to Congress Definitions of all denominat ors and numerators for each performance measure topic Detailed description of the logic for the denominator and numerator, including specific codes, fields, taxonomies , and/or values searched Key changes to logic from the previous year, if any Description of which patients and information are contained on the patient list Performance measure source and past IHS performance, if any, and IHS or Healthy People (HP) 2020 targets for the performance measure Report examples Patient list example s Note: All report examples and patient list examples used in this section were produced from \"scrubbed\" demonstration databases and do not represent individual patient data. 2.1 Performance Measure Logic Basics 2.1.1 CRS Denominator Definitions Each performance measure topic ha s one or more defin e denominators and numerators. The denominator is the total population that is being reviewed for a specific measure. For the National GPRA & Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART ) Report, only one denominator for each topi c is reported. These denominators are pre- defined, based on the Active Clinical Population definition. For the Selected Measures reports for local use (CRS Version 11. 1 User Manual, S ection 5.1 2), multiple denominators may be reported to provide a complete pi cture of cli nical performance. There are also additional options available to further refine denominator definitions. Clinical Reporting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic June 2011 2 2.1.1.1 Denominator Definitions for National GPRA Reporting The Active Clinical population is the denominator definition used as the basis for most GPRA me asures. This denominator was developed in FY 2003 specifically for clinical performance measures because it is more representative of the active clinical population. Note : There are facilities that do not offer direct care. Patients in these facilities receive only Contract Health Services (CHS) and therefore do not meet the requirements of the Active Clinical population. A new site parameter, Contract Health Site Only, was added for these facilities in FY2006. Prior to FY 2003, the GPRA User Population den ominator definition was used for national reporting, similar to the agency's IHS User Population definition. The Active Clinical population for the National GPRA & PART Report is defined by the following criteria: Patients with the name of \"DEMO,PATIENT\" o r who are included in the Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) Demo/Test Patient Search Template (DPST option located in the PCC Management Reports, Other section) will be automatically excluded from the denominator. Patient must have two visits t o medical clinics in the past three years. At least one visit must be to one of the following core medical clinics: 01 General 24 Well Child 06 Diabetic 28 Family Practice 10 GYN 57 EPSDT 12 Immunization 70 Women's Health 13 Internal Medicine 80 Urgent Care 20 Pediatrics 89 Evening Clinical Reporting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinica l Measures Performance Measure Logic June 2011 3 The second visit can be either to one of the core medical clinics in the previous list or to one of the following additional medical clinics: 02 Cardiac 37 Neurology 03 Chest And TB 38 Rheumatology 05 Dermatology 49 Nephrology 07 ENT 50 Chronic Disease 08 Family Planning 69 Endocrinology 16 Obstetrics 75 Urology 19 Orthopedic 81 Men's Health Screening 23 Surgical 85 Teen Clinic 25 Other 88 Sports Medicine 26 High Risk B8 Gastroenterology - Hepatology 27 General Preventive 31 Hypertension C3 Colposcopy 32 Postpartum Patient must be alive on the last day of the report period. Patient must be American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) (defined as Beneficiary 01). This data item is entered and updated during the patient registration process. Patient must reside in a community included in the site's \"official\" GPRA community taxonomy, defined as a ll communities of residence in the CHS catchment area specified in the community taxonomy specified by the user. The Active Clinical CHS Population for National GPRA & PART Reports is defined as follows: Patients with the name of \"DEMO,PATIENT\" or who are included in the RPMS Demo/Test Patient Search Template (DPST option located in the Patient Care Component [PCC] Management Reports, Other section) will be automatically excluded from the denominator. Patient must have two CHS visits in the three years prio r to the end of the report period. Patient must be alive on the last day of the report period. Patient must be AI/AN (defined as Beneficiary 01). This item is entered and updated during the patient registration process. User must reside in a community included in the site's official GPRA community taxonomy, defined as all communities of residence in the CHS catchment area specified in the community taxonomy that is specified by the user. Clinical Reporting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Me asure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic June 2011 4 The Active Clinical Behavioral Health Population for National GPRA & PART Reports is defined as follows: Patients with the name of \"DEMO,PATIENT\" or who are included in the RPMS Demo/Test Patient Search Template (DPST option located in the Patient Care Component [PCC] Management Reports, Other section) will be automatica lly excluded from the denominator. Patient must have two behavioral health visits in the three years prior to the end of the report period. Patient must be alive on the last day of the report period.

User must reside in a community included in the site's official GPRA community taxonomy, defined as all communities of residence in the Urban Outreach & Referral catchment area specifi ed in the community taxonomy that is specified by the user. The GPRA User Population for the National GPRA & PART Report is defined by the following criteria: Patients with the name of \"DEMO,PATIENT\" or who are included in the RPMS Demo/Test Patient Search Template (DPST option located in the PCC Management Reports, Other section) will be automatically excluded from the denominator. Patient must have been seen at least once in the three years prior to the end of the time period, regardless of the clinic typ e. Patient must be alive on the last day of the report period. Patient must be AI/AN (defined as Beneficiary 01). This data item is entered and updated during the patient registration process. Patient must reside in a community included in the site's \"official\" GPRA community taxonomy, defined as all communities of residence in the CHS catchment area specified in the community taxonomy specified by the user. Note: The GPRA User Population definition is simi lar, but not identical, to the definition used by IHS headquarters (HQ) for annual user population statistics. GPRA \"visits\" are not required to be workload reportable as defined by IHS HQ. Clinical Reporting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic June 2011 5 2.1.1.2 Denominator Definitions for Selected Measures Reports In addition to the National GPRA & PART Report, CRS provides Selected Measures reports intended for local facility use for specific public health and/or performance improvement initiatives (CRS Version 11. 1 User Manual, Section 5.1 2). Multiple denominators and nume rators will be reported for each measure (e.g., both Active Clinical and GPRA User Population). Users have additional options to define the denominators as explained below. The Active Clinical Population for Selected Measures (Local) Reports is defined as follows: Patients with name \"DEMO,PATIENT\" or who are included in the RPMS Demo/Test Patient Search Template (DPST option located in the PCC Management Reports, Other section) will be automatically excluded from the denominator. Patient must have two visits to medical clinics in the past three years. At least one visit must be to one of the following core medical clinics: 01 General 24 Well Child 06 Diabetic 28 Family Practice 10 GYN 57 EPSDT 12 Immunization 70 Women's Health 13 Internal Medicine 80 Urgent Care 20 Pediatrics 89 Evening The second visit can be either to one of the core medical clinics in the previous list or to one of the following additional medical clinics: 02 Cardiac 37 Neurology 03 Chest And TB 38 Rheumatology 05 Dermatology 49 Nephrology 07 ENT 50 Chronic Disease 08 Family Planning 69 Endocrinology 16 Obstetrics 75 Urology 19 Orthopedic 81 Men's Health Screening 23 Surgical 85 Teen Clinic 25 Other 88 Sports Medicine 26 High Risk B8 Gastroenterology - Hepatology 27 General Preventive 31 Hypertension C3 Colposcopy 32 Postpartum Clinical Reporting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic June 2011 6 Patient must be alive on the last day of the Report period. User defines population type: AI/AN patients only, non AI/AN, or both. This data item is entered and updated during the patient registration process. User defines general population: single community; group of multiple communities (community taxonomy); user -defined list of patient (patient panel); or all patients regardless of community of residence. The Active Clinical CHS Population for Selected Measures (Local) Reports is defined as follows: Patients with the name of \"DEMO,PATIENT\" or who are included in the RPMS Demo/Test Patient Search Template (DPST option located in the PCC Management Reports, Other section) will be automatically excluded from the denominator. Patient must have two CHS visits in the three years prior to the end of the Report Period. Patient must be alive on the last day of the report period. User defines population type: AI/AN patients only, non AI/AN, or both. User defines general population: single community; group of multiple communities (community taxonomy); user -defined list of patient (patient panel); or all patients regardless of commu nity of residence. The Active Clinical Behavioral Health Population for Selected Measures (Local) Reports is defined as follows: Patients with the name of \"DEMO,PATIENT\" or who are included in the RPMS Demo/Test Patient Search Template (DPST option located in the PCC Management Reports, Other section) will be automatically excluded from the denominator. Patient must have two behavioral health visits in the three years prior to the end of the Report Period. Patient must be alive on the l ast day of the report period. User defines population type: AI/AN patients only, non AI/AN, or both.

The User Population for Selected Measures (Local) reports is defined as follows: Clinical Reporting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic June 2011 7 Patients with the name of \"DEMO,PATIENT\" or who are included in the RPMS Demo/Test Patient Search Template (DPST option locat ed in the PCC Management Reports, Other section) will be excluded from the denominator automatically. Patient must have been seen at least once in the three years prior to the end of the time period, regardless of the clinic type. Patient must be alive on the last day of the report period. User defines population type: AI/AN patients only, non AI/AN, or both. User defines general population: single community, group of multiple communities (community taxonomy); user -defined list of patient (patient panel); or all patients regardless of community of residence. 2.1.2 Performance Measure Logic Example Cancer Screening: Pap Smear Rates : During FY 2011, achieve the tentative target rate of 55.7% for the proportion of female patients ages 21 through 64 without a docum ented history of hysterectomy who have had a Pap screen within the previous three years. For CRS, the GPRA measure definition is defined as: Denominator (total number of patients evaluated): Active Clinical female patients ages 21 through 64, excluding tho se with documented history of hysterectomy. (The clinical owner of the measure has determined based on current medical guidelines that \"eligibl e\" women are defined as ages 21 -64.) Numerator (those from the denominator who meet the criteria for the measure) : patients with documented Pap smear in past three years or refusal in past year. For the programmer, the Pap Smear measure is described in terms of the following logic : 1. Begin with the Active Clinical population definition . Exclude any patients with the na me of \"DEMO,PATIENT.\" Exclude any patient records that are included in the RPMS Demo/Test Patient Search Template. Exclude any patients with a date of death in the Patient Registration file. Exclude any patients who do not have value 01 (AI/AN) in the Beneficiary field in Patient Registration file. Exclude any patients whose Community of Residence is not included in the site's defined GPRA Community Taxonomy for this report. Clinical Reporting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic June 2011 8 For the remaining patients, search visit files fo r the three years prior to the selected report end date; exclude any patients whose visits do not meet the \"two medical clinics\" definition; or , for facilities with the CHS -Only site parameter set to Yes, exclude any patients who do not have two CHS visits in the past three years. 2. From these patients, identify the subset that are female and that are at least age 21 on the first day of the current report period and less than age 65 on the last day of the report period. 3. Exclude patients with documented hyster ectomy by searching the V Procedur e file for procedure codes 68.4-68.8 or V CPT Women's Health procedure called Hysterectomy any time before the end of the r eport period. 4. For these patients (the denominator), check for a Pap smear in the past three years in the following order: a. Check V Lab for a lab test called P ap Smear and for any site -populated pap smear lab test documented in the BGP PAP SMEAR TAX taxonomy; or b. Check V Lab for any LOINC code listed in the predefined BGP PAP LOINC CODES taxonomy (see the CRS Technical Manual for specific codes); or c. Check the Purpose of Visit file (V POV) for: a diagnosis of: V67.01 Follow - Smear, V76.2- Screen Mal Neop -Cervix, V72.32 Encounter for Pap Cervical Smear to Confirm Findings of Recent Normal Smear Following Initial Abnormal Smear, V72.3 Gynecological Ex amination, Pap Cervical Smear as Part of General Gynecological Exam, Pelvic Exam (annual) (periodic) (old code, to be counted for visits prior to 10/1/04 only), V76.47 Vaginal Pap Smear for Post -Hysterectomy Patients, 795.0*, 795.10-16, 795.19; or d. Check V Procedures for a procedure of 91.46; or e. Check V CPT Check t he Women's Health Tracking package for documentation of a procedure ca lled Pap Smear and where the result does not have \"ERROR/DISREGARD\" . If a visit with any of the specified codes is found, the patient is considered to have met the measure, and the program checks the next patient. Clinical Reporting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinical Measures Performance Measur e Logic June 2011 9 2.1.3 Age Ranges Unless otherwise noted, for the purposes of CRS reports, the age of a patient is calculated at the beginning of the report period. For example, for a report period of July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011, Jane Doe is defined as age 74 if her birth date is June 10, 1936, even though she becomes age 75 during the report period. 2.1.4 Standard Health Care Codes 2.1.4.1 Current Procedural Terminology Codes One of several code sets used by the healthcare industry to standardize data, and allow for comparison and analysis. Current Procedural Terminol ogy (CPT) was developed and is updated annually by the American Medical Association, and is widely used in producing bills for services rendered to patients. CPTs include codes for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and specify information that differe ntiates the codes based on cost. CPT codes are the most widely accepted nomenclature in the United States for reporting physician procedures and services for federal and private insurance third- party reimbursement. CRS searches for CPT and other codes as specified in the logic definition to determine if a patient meets a denominator or numerator definition. 2.1.4.2 International Classification of Disease Codes One of several code sets used by the healthcare industry to standardize data. The International Classification of Disease (ICD) is an international diagnostic coding scheme. In addition to diseases, ICD also includes several families of terms for medical- specialty diagnoses, health status, disablements, procedure, and reasons for contact with healthc are providers. IHS currently uses ICD, Ninth Revision (ICD -9) for coding. CRS searches for ICD and other codes as specified in the logic definition, to determine if a patient meets a denominator or numerator definition. 2.1.4.3 Logical Observation Identifiers N ames and Codes Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC\u00ae). A standard coding system originally initiated for laboratory values, the system is being extended to include nonlaboratory observations (electrocardiograms, vital signs, etc.). Standard code sets are used to define individual tests and mitigate variations in local terminologies for laboratory and other healthcare procedures, for example, Glucose or Glucose Test. IHS began integrating LOINC values into RPMS in several pilot sites in 2002. Refer to the CRS Version 11.1 Technical Guide for a list of specific LOINC codes included in each LOINC taxonomy.

A1c definition: Searches for most recent A1c test with a result during the Report Period. If none found, CRS searches for the most rec ent A1c test without a HGB A1C TAX. BP documented definition: Having a minimum of two BPs documented on non - Emergency Room ( ER) visits during the Report Period. CRS uses mean of last three BPs documented on non -ER visits during the Report Period. If three BPs are not available, uses mean of last two non -ER BPs. If a visit contains more than one BP, the lowest BP will be used, defined as having the lowest systolic value. The mean Systolic value is calculated by adding the last three (or two) systolic values and dividing by three (or two). The mean Diastolic value is calculated by adding the diastolic values from the last three (or two) BPs and dividing by three (or two). If CRS is not able to calculate a mean BP, it will search for CPT 0001F, 2000F, 3074F -3080F documented on a non -ER visit during the Report Period. Controlled BP definition: CRS uses a mean, as described above. If the mean systolic and diastolic values do not both meet the criteria for controlled, then the va lue is considered not controlled. BP documented and Controlled BP: If CRS is not able to calculate a mean BP from BP measurements, it will search for the most recent of any of the following CPT codes documented on non- ER visits during the Report BP systolic and diastolic values do not have to be recorded on the same day. If there are multiple values on the same day, the CPT indicating the lowes t value will be used. The following combination represents BP < 130/80 and will be included in the Controlled BP numerator: CPT 3074F and 3078F. All other combinations will not be included in the Controlled BP numerator. LDL definition : Finds last test don e during the Report Period; defined as CPT 80061, CHOLESTEROL TAX. Nephropathy assessment definition: (1) Estimated GF R with result during the report period, defined as any of the following: (A) Site -populated taxonomy BGP GPRA ESTIMATED (B) LOINC taxonomy, and (2) Quantitative Urinary Clinical Reporting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic June 2011 15 Protein Assessment during the Report Period, defined as any of the following: (A) CPT 82042, 82043, -populated taxonomy BGP QUANT URINE PROTEIN.

Immunizat ion Program Numerator: Patients who have received the 4:3:1:3:3:1 combination (i.e. , 4 DTaP, 3 Polio, 1 MMR, 3 HiB, 3 Hepatitis B, and 1 Varicella), not including refusals, contraindications, and patients with evidence of disease.

Logic Description Age d efinition: Age of the patient is calculated at the beginning of the Report Period. Therefore the age range will be adjusted to 7 -23 months, which makes the patient between the ages of 19 -35 months at the end of the Report Period. Because IZ data comes from multiple sources, any IZ codes documented on dates within 10 days of each other will be considered as the same immunization. Active Immunization Package Patients denominator definition: Same as User Pop definition except includes only patients flagged as active in th e Immunization Package. Clinical Reporting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic June 2011 62 Note : Only values for the Current Period will be reported for this denominator since currently there is not a way to determine if a patient was active in the Immunization Package during the Previous Year or Baseline Periods. Dosage and types of immunization definitions: Four doses of DTaP: (1) four DTaP/DTP/Tdap; (2) one DTaP/DTP/Tdap and three DT/td; (3) one DTaP/DTP/Tdap and three each of Diphtheria and Tetanus; (4) four DT and four Acellular Pertussis; (5) four Td and four Acellular Pertussis; or (6) four each of Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Acellular Pertussis. Three doses of Polio: (1) v OPV; (2) three IPV; or (3) combination of OPV and IPV totaling 3 doses. One dose of MMR: (1) MMR; (2) one M/R and one Mumps; (3) one R/M and one Measles; or (4) one each of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella. Three doses of Hep B or two doses if documented with CPT 90743. Three doses of HIB One dose of Varicella Four doses of Pneumococcal Two doses of Hepatitis A Two or three doses of Rotavirus, depending on the vaccine administered Two doses of Influenza Except for the Immunization Program Numerators, NMI refusals, evidence of disease, and contraindications for individual immunizations will also count toward meeting the definition, as defined below. Refusals will count toward meeting the definition for refusal numerators only. Note : NMI refusals are not counted as refusals; rather, they are counted as contraindications. For immunizations that allow a different number of doses (e.g. 2 o r 3 Rotavirus): To count toward the numerator with the smaller number of doses, all of the patient's vaccinations must be part of the smaller dose series. For example, for a patient to count toward the Rotavirus numerator with only 2 doses, all two doses must be included in the 2 -dose series codes listed in the Rotavirus definition. A patient with a mix of 2 -dose and 3 -dose series codes will need 3 doses to count toward the numerator. Clinical Reporting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic June 2011 63 Each immunization must be refused and documented separately. For examp le, if a patient has an NMI refusal for Rubella only, then there must be an immunization, contraindication, or separate NMI refusal for the Measles and Mumps immunizations. For immunizations where required number of doses is >1, only one NMI refusal is nec essary to be counted in the numerator. For example, if there is a single NMI refusal for Hepatitis B, the patient will be included in the numerator. For immunizations where required number of doses is >1, only one contraindication is necessary to be counted in the numerator. For example, if there is a single contraindication for HiB, the patient will be included in the numerator. Evidence of disease will be checked for at any time in the child's life (prior to the end of the Report Period.) To be counted in subnumerator A, a patient must meet the numerator definition and have a REF refusal in PCC or a Parent or Patient Refusal in the IZ program for any of the immunizations in the numerator. For example, if a patient refused Rubella only but had immunizations for Measles and Mumps, the patient would be included in subnumerator A . For the separate numerator for REF refusal (Patient Refusal for Service) in PCC or a Parent or Patient refusal in the IZ program, all conditions shown below must be met: Each immuniza tion must be refused and documented separately. For example, if a patient has an REF refusal for Rubella, then there also must be an immunization, contraindication, or separate REF refusal for Measles and Mumps. Where the required number of doses is >1, o nly one REF refusal in PCC or one Parent or Patient refusal in the IZ program is necessary to be counted in the numerator. For example, for the 4 DTaP numerator, only one refusal is necessary to be counted in the refusal numerator.

For those with a BMI calculated, those considered obese using BMI and standard tables 3. Total of overweight and obese Patients with documented refusal in past year. Logic Description Age is calculated at beginning of t he Report Period. BMI calculation definition: CRS calculates BMI at the time the report is run, using NHANES II. For age 18 and under, a height and weight must be taken on the same day any time during the Report Period. For 19 through 50, height and weight must be recorded within last 5 years, not required to be on the same day. For over 50, height and weight within last 2 years, not required to be recorded on same day. Overweight but not obese is defined as BMI of 25 through 29 for adults 19 and older. Obe se is defined as BMI of 30 or more for adults 19 and older. For ages 2- 18, definitions are based on standard tables. Refusals include REF, NMI, and UAS (unable to screen) and must be documented during the past year. For ages 18 and under, both the height and weight must be refused on the same visit at any time during the past year. For ages 19 and older, the height and weight must be refused during the past year and are not required to be on the same visit. Patients whose BMI either is greater or less than the Data Check Limit range shown in the BMI Standard Reference Data Table in PCC will not be included in the report counts for Overweight or Obese.

A Body Mass Index report can be run from your PCC Management Reports menu. This report can be run for all patients or for a specific template of pat ients that has been pre -defined with a QMan search. The BMI report will provide you with patient height, weight, date weight taken, BMI and NHANES percentile. 2. Recent guidelines indicate that height for adults must be taken at least once every five years, r ather than once after age 18. Your BMI rates may be lower than anticipated because of height data that is over five years old. 3. If height and weight measurements are being recorded as cm/kg vs. in/lbs ensure providers are noting they are cm/kg and that data entry is entering the measurements correctly in PCC, as shown below. Use mnemonics of CHT and KWT (vs. HT and WT), or Add \"c\" after height value and \"k\" after weight value (e.g. 100c, 50k) DU May 25 , 2011 Page 143 *** IHS 2011 Selected Measures with Community Specified Report *** DEMO INDIAN HOSPITAL Report Period: Jan 01, 2011 to Dec 31, 2011 Previous Year Period: Jan 01, 2010 to Dec 31, 2010 Baseline Period: Jan 01, 2000 to Dec 31, 2000 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Obesity Assessment (con't) REPORT % PREV YR % CHG from BASE % CHG from Clinical Reporting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic June 2011 134 PERIOD PERIOD PREV YR % PERIOD BASE % Active Clinical Pts ages 2-74 1,400 1,096 982 # w/BMI calculated -No Refusals 880 62.9 824 75.2 -12.3 712 72.5 - 9.6 A. # Overweight w/ % of Total BMI 242 27.5 237 28.8 - 1.3 191 26.8 +0.7 B. # Obese w/ % of Total BMI 372 42.3 339 267 37.5 +4.8 C. # Overweight /Obese w/ % of Total BMI 614 69.8 576 69.9 - 0.1 458 64.3 +5.4 # w/BMI refusal (No BMI) 4 0.3 0 0.0 +0.3 0 0.0 +0.3 Male Active Clinical Pts 2-74 595 465 410 # w/BMI calculated % of Total BMI 103 30.2 98 29.6 +0.6 73 25.8 +4.4 B. # Obese 190 67.1 +8.5 # w/BMI refusal (no BMI) 2 0.3 0 0.0 + 0.3 0 0.0 +0.3 Female Active Clinical Pts 2-74 805 631 572 # w/BMI calculated -No Refusals 539 67.0 493 78.1 -11.2 429 75.0 - 8.0 A. # Overweight w/ % of Total BMI 139 25.8 139 28.2 -2.4 118 27.5 - 1.7 B. # Obese w/ % of Total BMI 217 35.0 356 337 68.4 - 2.3 268 62.5 +3.6 # w/BMI refusal (No BMI) 2 0.2 0 0.0 +0.2 0 0.0 +0.2 Figure 2-63: Sample Report, Obesity Assessment Obesity Assessment (con't) TOTAL ACTIVE CLINICAL POPULATION 25-34 # Active Clin 109 112 15 7 133 233 215 216 225 # w/BMI calculated -No Refusals 52 44 89 117 183 146 128 121 % w/BMI calculated -No Refusals 47.7 39.3 56.7 88.0 78.5 67.9 59.3 53.8 Clinical Reporting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic June 2011 135 # A.

Clinical Reporting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic June 2011 137 Logic Description BMI calculation definition: All patients for whom a BMI could be calculated and who are between the ages of two and five at the beginning of the Report Period and who do not turn age six during the Report Period are included in this measure. Age in the age groups is calculated based on the date of the most current BMI found. For example, a patient may be two years of age at the beginning of the time period, but is three years old at the time of the most current BMI found. That patient will fall into the age three group. CRS looks for the most recent BMI in the Report Period. CRS calculates BMI at the time the report is run using NHANES II. A height and weight must be taken on the same day any time during the Report Period. The BMI values for this measure are reported differently than in Obesity Assessment since this age group is children ages 2- 5, whose BMI values are age- dependent. The BMI values are categorized as Overweight for patients with a BMI in the 85th to 94th percentile and Obese for patients with a BMI at or above the 95th percentile. Patients whose BMI either is greater or less than the Data Check Limit range shown below will not be included in the report counts for Overweight or Obese.

Clinical Reporting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic June 2011 150 Blood pressure defini tion: CRS uses mean of last three Blood Pressures documented on non- ER visits in the past two years. If three BPs are not available, uses mean of last two non -ER BPs. If a visit contains more than one BP, the lowest BP will be used, defined as having the l owest systolic value. The mean Systolic value is calculated by adding the last three (or two) systolic values and dividing by three (or two). The mean Diastolic value is calculated by adding the diastolic values from the last three (or two) blood pressures and dividing by three (or two). If the systolic and diastolic values do not both meet the current category, then the value that is least controlled determines the category. If CRS is not able to calculate a mean B P, it will search for CPT 0001F, 2000F, 3074F -3080F documented on a non -ER visit during the Report Period.

AMI diagnosis may be made at an inpatient or outpatient visit but must occur between six months prior to beginning of Report Period through first six months of the Report Period. Inpatient visit defined as Service Category of H ( Hospitalization). If patient has more than one episode of AMI during the timeframe, CRS will include only the first hospital discharge or ambulatory visit. Denominator Exclusions Patients meeting any of the following conditions will be excluded from the denominator. If inpatient visit, patients with Discharge Type of Irregular (AMA), Transferred, or contains \"Death.\" Patients with a Diagnosis Modifier of C (Consider), D (Doubtful), M (Maybe, Possible, Perhaps), O (Rule Out), P (Probable), R (Resolved), S (S uspect, Suspicious), or T (Status Post).

To be included in the numerators, a patient must meet one of the three conditions below. 1. A total days' supply > = 135 days in the 180 days following discharge date for inpatient visits or visit date for ambulatory visits. Medications must not have a comment of RETURNED TO STOCK. Prior active prescriptions can be included if the treatment days fall within the 180 day s following discharge/visit date. Prior active prescription defined as most recent prescription (see codes below) prior to admission/visit date with the number of days supply equal to or greater than the discharge/visit date minus the prescription date; or 2. A refusal of the medication at least once at time of diagnosis through the 180 days after AMI; or 3. Have a contraindication/previous adverse reaction to the indicated medication. 4. Refusals and contraindications/previous ADR/allergies are only counted if a patient did not have a prescription for the indicated medication. Patients without a prescription who have a refusal and/or contraindication/ADR/allergy will be counted in subnumerators B -C. Because a patient may have both a refusal and a contraindication/AD R/allergy, the sub -numerator totals of A -C may not add up the to the numerator total. Note: If the medication was started and then discontinued, CRS will recalculate the # Days Prescribed by subtracting the prescription date (i.e., visit date) from the V M edication Discontinued Date. Example: Rx Date=11/15/ 2011, Discontinued Date=11/19/ 2011, Recalculated # Days Prescribed=4.

Prescription(s) for the indicated medication with a total days supply of 180 days or more during the Report Period. Medications must not have a comment of RETURNED TO STOCK; or 2. A refusal of the med ication during the Report Period; or 3. Have a contraindication/previous adverse reaction to the indicated medication Refusals and contraindications/previous ADR/allergies are only counted if a patient did not have a prescription for the indicated medication. Patients without a prescription who have a refusal and/or contraindication/ADR/ allergy will be counted in sub- numerators B -C. Because a patient may have both a refusal and a contraindication/ADR/allergy , the sub- numerator totals of A -C may not add up the to the numerator total. For prescriptions, the days supply requirement may be met with a single prescription or from a combination of prescriptions for the indicated medication that were filled during the Report Period and prescriptions filled prior to th e Report Period but which are still active (i.e. , prior active prescription). Prior active prescriptions can be included if the treatment days fall within the Report Period. Prior active prescription defined as most recent prescription for the indicated medication (see codes below) prior to Report Period Start Date with the number of days supply equal to or greater than the Report Period Start Date minus the prescription date. Note: If a prescription for a medication was started and then discontinued, CRS will recalculate the # Days Prescribed by subtracting the prescription date (i.e., visit date) from the V Medication Discontinued Date.

Logic Description Key STIs are Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, HIV/AIDS, and Syphilis. Key STI diagnoses are defined with the following codes. ICD and Other Codes Logic for Identifying Patients Diagnosed with Key STI : Any patient with one or more diagnoses of any of the key STIs defined above during the period 60 days prior to the beginning of the Report Period through the first 300 days of the Report Period. Clinical Reporting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic June 2011 220 Logic for Identifying Separate Incidents of Key STIs : One patient may have one or multiple occurrences of one or multiple STIs during the year. Incidents of an STI are identified beginn ing with the date of the first key STI diagnosis (see definition above) occurring between 60 days prior to the beginning of the Report Period through the first 300 days of the Report Period. A second incident of the same STI is counted if another diagnosis with the same STI occurs two months or more after the initial diagnosis. A different STI diagnosis that occurs during the same 60 -day time period as the first STI counts as a separate incident. Example of Patient with Multiple Incidents of Single STI: Visit Total Incidents 08/01/10: Patient screened for Chlamydia 0 08/08/10: Patient diagnosed with Chlamydia 1 10/15/10: Patient diagnosed with Chlamydia 2 10/25/10: Follow -up for Chlamydia 2 11/15/0: Patient diagnosed with Chlamydia 2 03/01/11: Patient diagnosed with Chlamydia 3 Denominator Logic for Needed Screenings : One patient may need multiple screening tests based on one or more STI incidents occurring during the time period. To be included in the needed screening tests denominator, the count will be derived from the number of separate STI incidents and the type(s) of screenings recommended for each incident. The recommended screenings for each key STI are listed below. STI Screenings screenings that are further evaluated for contraindications. The following are reasons that a recommended screening is identified as not needed (i.e., contraindicated). 1. The patient has a documented STI diagnosis corresponding to the screening type in the same time period. For example, a patient with both a Chlamydia and a gonorrhea diagnosis on the s ame visit does not need the recommended Chlamydia screening based on the gonorrhea diagnosis. Clinical Reporting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic June 2011 221 2. Only one screening for each type of STI is needed during the relevant time period, regardless of the number of different STI incidents identified. For example, if a patient is diagnosed with Chlamydia and Gonorrhea on the same visit, only one screening each is needed for HIV/AIDS and Syphilis. 3. A patient with HIV/AIDS diagnosis prior to any STI diagnosis that triggers a recommended HIV/AIDS screening does not need t he screening ever. Numerator Logic : To be counted in the numerator, each needed screening in the denominator must have a corresponding laboratory test or test refusal documented in the period from one month prior to the relevant STI diagnosis date through two months after the STI incident. Key STI screenings are defined with the following codes. CPT Codes ICD and or BKM RPR TESTS TAX Refusal of any screening Any refusal type (REF, NMI, etc.) for any of the four screening tests as defined above during the specified time period. Logic Examples Example of Patient with Single Diagnosis of Single STI : 08/01/10: Patient screened for Chlamydia 08/08/10: Patient 3 screens needed, Numerator: 3 screens performed. Example of Patient with Multiple Diagnoses of Single STI : Clinical Reporting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic June 2011 222 08/01/10: Patient screened for Chlamydia 08/08/10: Patient diagnosed HIV/AIDS, Syphilis Result: 6 screens needed (2 each of 3 types), Numerator: 3 screens performed (1 each of 3 types) Example of Patient with Single Diagnosis of Multiple STIs : 10/15/10: Patient screened for Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, above) Result: Denominator: 2 sc reens needed, Numerator: 2 screens performed prior to triggering diagnoses but within timeframe Example of Patient with Multiple Diagnoses of Multiple STIs : 06/15/05: Patient diagnosed with HIV/AIDS 08/01/10: Patient screened for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea needed: Syphilis (HIV/AIDS needed 08/08/10 Patient screened for HIV/AIDS and Syphilis -since only the Syphilis screen is needed, the HIV/AIDS screen is not counted at all 12/01/10: Patient screened for Chlamydia 12/08/10 Patient diagnosed with #2) -2 Syphilis screens needed (2 Syphilis and 1 Gonorrhea), Numerator: 2 screens performed (2 Syphilis) Key Logic Changes from CRS Version 11.0 1.

OA defined as diagnosis (POV or Problem List) 715.* prior to the Report period, and at least two OA POVs during the Report Period. For all maintenance therapy medications, each medication must be prescribed within the past 465 days of the end of the Report Period (i.e., the Medication Period) and the sum of the days supply =>348. This means the patient must have been on the medication at least 75% of the Medication Period. Two examples are shown below to illustrate this logic . Medications must not have a comment of RETURNED TO STOCK. Example of Patient Not on Chronic Medication (not included in Denominator) : Report Period: Jan 1 -Dec 31, 2011 Medication Period: 465 days from end of Report Period ( Dec 31, 2011): Sep 22, 2010-Dec 31, 2011 Medication Prescribed: Diclofenac: 1st Rx: Oct 15, 2010, Days Supply=90; 2nd Rx: Jan 1, 2011: Days Supply=90; 3rd Rx: Mar 15, 2011: Days Supply=90.

The days supply requirement may be met with a single prescription or from a combination of prescriptions for the same medication that were filled during the Medication Period. However, for all medications, there must be at least one prescription filled during the Report Period. Note: If the medication was started and then discontinued, CRS will recalculate the # Days Prescribed by subtracting the prescription date (i.e., visit date) from the V Medication Discontinued Date.

However, if the patient were diagnosed again on February 16, 2011 (46 days after onset), that diagnosis counts as a separate visit. Because RPMS does not store the date of onset, visit date will be used as a surrogate for onset date. CRS uses the following codes and taxonomies to define the denominato r and numerators.

If three BPs are not available, uses mean of last two non -ER BPs. If a visit contains more than one BP, the lowest BP will be used, defined as having the lowest systolic value. The mean Systolic value is calculated by adding the last three (or two) systolic values and dividing by three (or two). The mean Diastolic value is calculated by adding the diastolic values from the last three (or two) blood pressures and dividing by three (or two).

Patients with proportion of days covered (PDC) >=90% during the Report Period. Logic Description Age is calculated at the beginning of the report period. To be included in the denominator, patients must have at least two prescriptions for that particular type of medication on two unique dates o f service at any time during the Report Period. Medications must not have a comment of RETURNED TO STOCK. The Index Prescription Start Date is the date when the medication was first dispensed within the Report Period. This date must be greater than 90 da ys from the end of the Report Period to be counted in the denominator. The medications in the measures are defined with medication taxonomies: BGP Reporting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic June 2011 262 For each PDC numerator: Proportion of days covered = # of days the patient was covered by at least one drug in the class / # of days in the patient's measurement perio d. Measurement Period definition: The patient's measurement period is defined as the number of days between the Index Prescription Start Date and the end of the Report Period. When calculating the number of days the patient was covered by at least one dru g in the class, if prescriptions for the same drug overlap, the prescription start date for the second prescription will be adjusted to be the day after the previous fill has ended. Note : If the medication was started and then discontinued, CRS will recalculate the # Days Prescribed by subtracting the prescription date (i.e. visit date) from the V Medication Discontinued Date. Example: Rx Date=11/15/2011, Discontinued Date=11/19/2011, Recalculated # Days Prescribed=4. Example of Proportion of Days Covered : Report Period: Jan 1 - Dec 31, 2011 1st Rx is Index Rx Start Date: 3/1/11, Days Gap = (9/11/11 - = Rx patient Patient's measurement period: 3/1/11 3/1/11 through 8/27/11 + 9/11/11 through 12/31/11 = 292 Days PDC = 292 / 306 = 95% For each Gap numerator: CRS will calcu late whether a gap in medication therapy of 30 or more days has occurred between each consecutive medication dispensing event during the Report Period. A gap is calculated as the days not covered by the days supply between consecutive medication fills. Clinical Reporting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic June 2011 263 Example of Medication Gap >=30 Days : Report Period: Jan 1 - Dec 31, 2011 1st Rx: 4/1/11, Days Supply=30 Rx covers #1 = (7/1/11 4/30/11) days covers through 3rd 10/1/11, Days Supply=90 #2 = (10/1/11 9/28/11) days Rx covers patient through 12/29/11 Gap #1 >=30 days, therefore patient will be included in the numerator for that medication.

Infant feeding choice definition: The documented feeding choice from the file V Infant Feeding Choice that is closest to the exact age that is being assessed will be used. For example, if a patient was assessed at 45 days old as 1/2 breastfed and 1/2 formula and assessed again at 65 days old as mostly breastfed, the mostly breastfed value will be used since it is closer to the exact age of two months (i.e., 60 days). Another example is a patient who was assessed at 67 days as m ostly breastfed and again at 80 days as mostly formula. In this case, the 67 days value of mostly breastfed will be used. The other exact ages are 180 days for six months, 270 days for nine months, and 365 days for one year. Clinical Reporting System Version 11.1 CRS Clinical Performance Measure Logic Manual for FY 2011 Clinical Measures Performance Measure Logic June 2011 272 In order to be included in the age- specific screening numerators, the patient must have been screened at the specific age range.

Numerator Logic: For Goal Set, the patient education code must have a \"GS\" value documented dur ing the Report Period.
