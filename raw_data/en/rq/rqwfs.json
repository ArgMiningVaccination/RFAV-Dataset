For example, Acupuncture is a popular treatment option traditionally used for treating many health conditions with minimal interference by promoting the free flow of Qi (Vital energy) though out the body. All bodily functions rely on Qi to perform their vital tasks and maintain health. Any abnormalities or extremes of imbalance of Qi and Yin and Yang (parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system) is said to result in ill-health or dysregulation. Therefore it is essential to restore this balance, firstly if possible through diet and lifestyle. Traditionally during a crisis when diet and lifestyle failed to bring about restoration, a fully qualified practitioner of TCM will attempt to rescue and restore the Qi (vital energy) by clearing potential blockages. improving blood flow and balancing the Yin and Yang. This is achieved by stimulating points along meridian pathways and releasing Ashi points (analgesic inducing extra points of tenderness) providing there is indication to do so and no medical contraindication. By needling (noxious stimuli), pressure (4 major mechanoreceptors) , heat, cold (thermoreceptors) and pain receptors (nociceptors)a practicioner aims to resolve clinical problems by facilitating a healing response and by other mechanisms laid down in TCM and 5 element theory\u2014a veritable gateway to health.

P.R.E.P.Protocol for Sports How can Acupuncture help with recovery and sports performance? What is the P.R.E.P. protocol for Sports? P.R.E.P. is an acronym that stands for Pain-Relief- Recovery-Endurance-Performance. It is a treatment protocol based on research into the effects of an Acupuncture program tailored to a top athlete conducted by Usichenko et al. in 2011. For a summary, please refer to Case study 1 below. It views the athlete holistically looking at what the athlete views as limiting factors in performance. For example, an athlete might be experiencing severe epigastric pain or knee weakness during running. These can all be limiting factors that can impact performance levels during competition. The objective is to look at eliminating or reducing weakness to maximize performance and increase strength and endurance. Anyone serious about staying active and healthy should seriously consider a balance between exercise and recovery and therapy and education should be part of that health and fitness program. A sports acupuncturist can help raise awareness about tissue healing effect, joint mechanics, and proper muscle activation. For active people of all abilities, the goal is to keep active well into old age by not stopping but tuning into your bodies and working within the limitations of your current health state. P.R.E.P. is about more than reducing pain but improving recovery -where problems are identified in the natural healing process such as repetitive trauma from injury or over use, leading to heightened inhibited reciprocal responses and delayed reactions - and ultimately boosting performance and unlocking your full potential, staying active to keep mobile for as long as possible, and being smart when training as exercising to exhaustion depletes Qi stores. regular and targeted exercise promotes the circulation of Qi and counters the detrimental effects of lack of exercise which leads to stagnation of Qi. Also being mindful of other exercises that can help to cultivate Qi such as Yoga, Tai Ji Quan, and Qigong that concentrate more than just muscles for those who have little energy and Qi is deficient through inactivity, or have overexerted themselves are viable options where sometimes less is more. T.H.E.R.A.P.Y.Y. Protocol for Health Issues How can Acupuncture help improve Health andwell-being? What is T.H.E.R.A.P.P.Y. protocol for Health issues? T.H.E.R.A.P.Y.Y. is an acronym that stands for Tonify- Harmonize- Energize- Reduce- Alleviate - Promote - Yin/Yang. It is based on a Chinese medicine system to increase available energy (Qi) throughout the body by reducing excess and Tonifying deficiency, or utilizing an evening method to harmonize the mind-body-spirit, therefore freeing up the body's innate ability to restore balance systemically on the interior as reflected on the exterior. Asthenia or lack of energy or weakness in the body could be due to stress or an ongoing health condition depleting the body of important health regulating functions. These regulating functions pertain to Qi, blood, the organs (zang-fu) from the interior to the exterior including the meridian and collaterals related to Yin and Yang in Traditional Chinese Medicine. For example, Yin and Yang describe the organic systems according to their analogical thinking. A quick illustration could be a hyper-function (Excess) of the organ Liver Qi due to stagnation in that channel. Liver Qi stagnation can transform into Fire and flare upwards to cause Tinnitus (ringing in the ears). It is essentially an increase in the flow of blood or fluids to the inner ear and can be due to many different causes. Many have experienced ringing in the ear at some point in their life. For example, during alcohol intoxication, the vessels can swell, leading to an increase in blood flow to the ears causing the ringing sound. Also, some of the alcohol can get absorbed into the ear and stay there long after the alcohol leaves the brain and blood, causing temporary hardness of hearing. The dizziness is primarily the body trying to re-orientate itself. For example, during an intense sparring match melee, or looking down from a great precipice or when intoxicated. Ringing in the ear usually occurs due to an accumulation of fluids, a sudden change in decibels such as in a loud and noisy room setting, or a medical condition called Meniere's Disease or Labyrinthitis. The T.H.E.R.A.P.Y.Y. protocol is useful in any imbalance of Yin and Yang as it helps rid the body of any accumulations naturally and channel it to deficient areas or bring them into harmony. It does this primarily by Tonification, Evening, and Reduction, stimulating and regulating the organs and channels innate healing ability through specific loci in the human body. Its objective is to restore the flow of Qi (vital energy) in the body and balance Yin and Yang. Just as the sun naturally rises and sets in the sky and the moon waxes until full moon and then wanes so Yin and Yang must both rise and fall in their own time, and restore balance to all things - Nio gateway to health Case study 1 Patient /participant A top modern Pentathlon (MP) athlete Intervention: An acupoint stimulation support program tailored to his deficits over a seven-year course. He competed in \u00e9p\u00e9e fencing, pistol shooting, swimming, steeplechase and a cross-country running. The symptoms that the athlete associated with a lower level of performance during the events included: severe epigastric pain; knee weakness while running; soreness in the wrists and fatigue in the arm during fencing; tremors and general excitement in the arm during the shooting contest and shoulder muscle stiffness during swimming. Acupuncture Point Program i) ST-36 and GB-34 (Running) ii) LI-4, 10, 11; SJ 5 and GB 21 (Fencing and swimming) iii) HT-7 and Li-4 (Shooting, calm the mind, relax muscles) iv) GV-26 (General Tonification) Comparison This study compared the mental and physiological performance throughout his sporting career. Outcome The MP athlete national ranking increased exponentially through his career on the national team. He ranked as one of the best in his team. His coach believed the intervention had a tremendous psychological effect on the athlete but could not rule out physiological enhancement attributed to the treatment.
