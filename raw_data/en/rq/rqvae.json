How the [immune](/page/Vaccination-Immunity) system works, how the vaccines have or have not worked and the [legal](/page/Vaccination-Legal) considerations. This is part two of a three part series addressing these areas and is written with the idea that it may be copied and passed around to your friends and loved ones. If you understood the [first part](/page/Vaccination-Immunity) in this series, you would understand that the best way to build a strong immune system is not through vaccinations but rather through natural exposure. However, most people default to the notion that vaccines have been very effective and have no side effects. This warrants a very serious look by a discerning parent. Most people assume that there is much scientific research to support the validity and efficacy of the vaccine premise. In reviewing over 1,700 references and scientific papers, I have yet to come across just one that supports the validity of administering vaccines to people. In fact, just the opposite is true - we should cease our dogged proclivity for the vaccination premise and the unmitigated injury to the health of our children and our nation. Consider these facts: DPT VACCINE (WHOOPING COUGH) - Pertussis toxin is highly toxic and scientists often use it to induce experimental brain damage in laboratory tested animals. - The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that every year in the U.S. about a half million children who receive the DPT shots suffer from reaction severe enough to contraindicate the administration of more pertusis vaccine. - There is a 94 times greater risk of dying from the DPT vaccine than from whooping cough itself. - There is a 3,888 times greater risk of acquiring long term damage from the DPT vaccine than from whooping cough itself. - There are an estimated 1,000 deaths per year from DPT vaccine. - There are nearly 12,000 cases of long term damage per year from the DPT vaccine. RUBELLA VACCINE - Rubella vaccine may be increasing the chance of infection in childbearing years because a large portion of children are found to have no evidence of immunity in blood tested four or five years after they received the rubella vaccination. - Neurologic reactions and arthritis have been reported following rubella vaccinations. MUMPS VACCINE - At least one report confirms that it is the vaccine strain itself and not the wild virus that causes vaccine-related mumps meningitis. MEASLES VACCINE - Of the 3,411 reported cases in the U.S. in 1988, 1,942 occurred among school aged children. Of these, 68.9 percent had been appropriately vaccinated. - In states with comprehensive vaccination requirements, between 61 and 90 percent of measles cases occur in people who have been appropriately vaccinated. POLIO VACCINE - The polio vaccines primary flaw is that it can directly cause polio. - According to Jonas Salk in 1976, the current live virus polio vaccine developed by Dr. Albert Sabin was \"the principle if not sole cause of the 140 polio cases reported in the U.S. since 1961\". Hib (MENENGITIS) VACCINE - In addition to the failure to prevent Hib meningitis and the known reactions and death, there are studies to confirm that Hib meningitis occurs greater than six times more often in children vaccinated with the Hib vaccine. HEPATITIS B VACCINE - Committee on Infectious Diseases (Anonymous 1992) stated that...immunization...will prevent only about 6,000 of the more than 200,000 HBV infections that occur in the U.S. each year. - Dr. George Peter, Chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics at the National Pediatric Infectious Disease Seminar on 12 June 1992 in Washington, DC gave as one of four reasons for recommending hepatitis B vaccine to all infants: CHILDREN ARE ACCESSIBLE!! As parents, it is time we reclaim the dignity of our children's health and learn to refuse to accept the enforcement of professionals who offer us a glass palace of scientific evidence built on quicksand. My wife and I have \"refused\". Our two children have not been vaccinated and the level of health that they have exhibited in their 12 and 13 years is truly amazing. Our children are "}
