DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Food and Nutrition Service 7 CFR Parts 210 and 220 [Amdts. 42 and 34, respectely] National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program, Compettive Foods AGENCY:. Food and Nutrition Servioe, USDA. ACTXf Final msi. SUMMARY: Food and Nutrition Service amends the National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program regalations relating to competitive foods. The \"competitive foods\" regulations, when taken as a whole, prohibit the sale of categories of foods of minimal nutritional value during specific periods of the school day, in schools participating in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs. These amendments implement the requirements of a court order, issued on June 27.1980. in two consolidated cases. Communty Nutriion knstitute v. Bergland and National Soft Drink Association v. Bergand (D.D.C to provide, that no food inay be exempted from the restricted sale requirements by virtue of fortification with nutrients. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 18, 1980. FOR FtNRTER INFORMATION CONTACT:. Stanley C. Garnett, Branch Chief, Policy and Program Development Branch, School Programs Division. FNS, USDA, Washington, D.C. 205 (202) 447--006.

Garnett, Branch Chie, Policy and Program Development Branch, School Programs Division, FNS, USDA, Washington, D.C. 202506 (2WN)447-909M. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:Administrative Procedures This final action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established in Secretary's Memorandum 193 to implement Executive Order 12044, and has not been classified as significant. This action implements the order issued by the U.S. District Court in Community Nutrition Institute v. Bergland and National Soft Drink Association v. Bergland (D.D.C.). The Court's order, which is discussed below, directs the Secretary to take certain actions with respect to the\"competitive foods\" regulation. Because these actions are mandated by court order rather than discretionary on the part of the Secretary, the Department has determined that solicitation of public comments would be impracticable and unnecessary. Furthemore, because the petition submission schedule published in the Fadeval Regter on October 31, 198, (45 FR 72061icts that petitions for exceptions must be submitted by November 15, I0, for the following school year, an emergency situation exists which warrants the immediate effectlvenss of these amendments. Background The Food and Nutrition Service published a final rule in the Federal Register on January 2. 190 (45 FR 6758), which amended 7 CFR Part 210, National School Lunch Program, and 7 CFR Part 220, School Breakfast Program. to implement Section 10 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, as amended by Section 17 of Pub. L 96-106. Sections 2=15(b)(1) and 220.12(b)(1) provide an exception procedure. Persons may request FNS to permit the unrestricted ule of an individual food in a category of foods of minimal nutritional value, if the food contains sufficient nutrients to satisfy the minimum nutritional value standard, \u00a7 1 210.2(hl-1) and 22D2(i-1), used to determine the categories of foods which are of minimal nutritional value. The petition procedure was developed to assure that no individual food which satisfies the standard is classified as a food of minimal value because of membership in a category of foods determined to be of minimal nutritional value. On June 27,1980, the U.S. District Court ordered that-The petition procedure set forth at 2 CFR 210.15tb]f1) shall not be invoked to exempt particular foods from the four restricted categories on the basis of fortification. To implement this order, \u00a7 I 210.15(b){1) and 220.12(b)(11 are amended to indicate'that for the purpose of determining whether a food should be exempted from a category of foods determined to be of minimal nutritional value, nutrients added to the food will not be considered. Further, in order to implement the Court's order, the definition of soda water has been amended to preclude the removal of a product from the soda water category by adding nutrients to it. PART 210-NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM I. Accordingly, Appendix B, paragraph (I) of Part 210, National School Lunch Program, and Part 229, School Breakfast Program, is amended by revising definition (1) as follows: Appanda B-Caftodes of Foods of Mtnimal Water-As defmed by 21 CFR 18&.175 Food and Drug Administration Regulatios. except no product shall be excluded from this delirltion because it contains artificial sweeteners or discrete nutrients added to the food such as vitamin minerals. and proteins. \u00a7210.15b [Amended} 2. Section 21 o1(b)(1), is amended by adding at the end of that paragraph the following sentence: * * * In determining whether an individual food is a food of minimal nutritional value, discrete nutrients added to the food will not be taken into account. PART 220--SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAM \u00a7 220.12 [Amended] 3. Section 220.12tb)(1) is amended by adding at the end of that paragraph the following sentence:* * * In determining whether an individual food is a food of minimal nutritional value, discrete nutrients added to the food will not be taken into account.

The Final Impact Statement describing each option is available from the above named individual. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established in Secretary's Memorandum 1955 to implement Exebutive Order 12044, and has been classified as \"not significant.\" Program titles and numbers from the \"Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance\" are Cotton Production Stabilization, 10.052; Feed Grain Stabilization, 10.055; and Wheat Production Stabilization, 10.058. This action will not have a significant impact specifically on area and community development. Therefore, review as established by OB Circular A-95 was not used to assure that units of local government are informed of this action. On Friday, July 18,1980, a proposed rule was published (45 FR 48151) outlining the changed requirements relating to interest and invitinlg public comment. No comment was received, nor has any event changed the desirability of the change outlined therein. The proposed rule includedchanges applicable to the rice program. These changes will be included in a separate final rule. Under the current regulations, all payments made to producers under the feed grain, upland cotton, and wheat programs (7 CFR Part 713) which are not earned by the producer must be refunded to the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation'Service (ASCS). Interest is not charged on these overpayments where a producer actually earned a part of the same type of payment (i.e., deficiency and disaster, diversion) for any crop or where the payment was erroneously made to a producer through no fault of that particular producer. Interest is charged in all other cases from the date of payment to the date of'refund. This final rule amends and supplements the current rules as follows: 1. The current rules do not distinguish between the producer who deliberately misrepresents a fact involving program requirements-and the producer who t does notFor example, when advance payments are made under the programs, a producer can receive an advance payment based on an honest intention t( comply with the program requirements, change his or her mind, and have to refund the payment. This producer would currently be chhrged the same rate of interest as one who received advance payments under the programs but never had any intention of complying with program requirements. Under this final rule, producers who are determined to have misrepresented a fact involving program requirements or who are determined to have engaged in a scheme or device to defeat the purpose of the program would be liable for payment of interest on the principal amount of the program payment at the rate of 18 percent per year from the date of the payment to the date of the refund. 2. The current rules do not provide adequate incentive for a-producer to refund overpayments made under the programs. Under the regulations now in effect, a producer is not charged interest with respect to program overpayments when a producer earns part of the same type of payment for any crop. Thus, the producer, in effect, has an interest-free loan until the overpayment is refunded. Under this final rule, a producer who does not refund an overpayment within 30 days from the billing date (date of the issuance of the letter demanding refund of the program overpayment) will be charged interest from the billing date until such refund is made. These changes are in general conformance with the overall policy for the Federal Government set by theFederal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR Part 101). Accordingly, the regulations appearing at 7 CFR Part 713 are amended as follows: Final Rule 1. Section 713.15 is amended by revising paragraph (e) to read as follows: \u00a7 713.15 General payment provisions. (e) Unearned Payments and Overpayments. The producer shall refund to Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) any amounts representing payments that exceed the payments actually earned under the programs 'prescribed by this part. Such refunds are due and payable to CCC within 30 days from the date of billing. (1) Effective with respect to determinations of overpayments made after enactment of this rule, refunds not made within 30 days from the date of billing are delinquent and shall accrue interest from the date billed until the date paid at the CCC commodity loan interest rate in effect on the billing date. (i) An unearned payment received through no fault of the producer. (ii) An overpayment involving deficiency or disaster payments, If the producer earns any deficiency or disaster payments for any crop for the farm under Parts 713 or 730 of this chapter. (iii) An overpayment Involving voluntary diversion payments, if the producer earns any voluntary diversion payment for any crop for the farm under Parts 713 or 730 of this chapter, (iv) An overpayment involving wheat grazing and hay paymehts, if the producer earns any wheat grazing and hay payment for the farm. (2) Refunds not covered by paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall accrue interest from the date of disbursement until the date paid, at the CCC commodity loan interest rate in effect on the billing date. 2. Section 713.22 is amended by redesignating paragraph (c) as paragraph (d) and adding a new paragraph (c) to read as follows: \u00a7 713.22 Misrepresentation and scheme or device. \"* * * * *t (c) Refunds determined to be due CCC after enactment of this rule under the provisions of this section shall bear interest at the rate of 18 percent per year.

Ray Fitzgerald, Administrator, ASCS IFR Doe. Acreage and Compliance AGENCY: Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARr. The purpose of this rule is to amend the regulations at 7 CFR Part 718 which govern the determinations of acreage and compliance under the production adjustment and marketing quota programs administered by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS). These changes in the regulations are required in order to conform with changes mandated by the enactment of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1980, (Pub. L. 96-213, 94 Stat 119 approved March 18,1980) and to improve the administration of the programs. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 21, 1980. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. H. Woodrow Jones, Production Adjustment Division, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, U.S.D.A.. P.O. Box 2415, Washington, D.C. 20013, (202) 447-3472. The Final Impact Statement describing the options considered in developing this final rule and the impact of implementing each option is available on request from the above-named individual. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established in Secretary's Memorandum No. 1955 to implement Executive Order 12044, and has been classified \"not significant.\" This rule allows for an administrative variance between determined acreage and program requirements for marketing quota crops and a tolerance for error in planting and reporting normal crop acreage (NCA] crops (i.e. crops that are ncluded in the NCA as provided for in 7 CFR Part 792). The present regulations provide that the State ASC Committee could select one of two methods for determining compliance: (1) measure all farms or (2) measure selected farms. This final rule deletes the provisions allowing measurement of all farms in a county asa means of determining compliance with any NCA requirements applicable to NCA crops planted on farms in the county. Measurement of all farms in the county will be utilized as the means of determining compliance for most marketing quota crops. This final rule also provides other changes to clarify administrative procedures utilized in determining crop and land use acreages for 1980 and subsequent crop years for marketing quota crops, program crops, and other price-supported crops, and includes provisions for determining total NCA, set-aside, and voluntary diversion acreages. Since producers are engaged in farming operations for the 1980 crop and are affected by the changes provided by this rule, the Deputy Administrator has determined in accordance with the public rulemaking requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 and Executive Order 12044 that it is impracticable and contrary to the public interest to provide B0 days for interested persons to file comments and to engage in public rulemaking procedure prior to the rule becoming effective, and that good cause exists for the rule becoming effective immediately upon publication. However, a 60-day comment period will be in effect upon publication of these final rules in the Federal Register. Any comments which are offered during the public comment period on any of the regulations contained in 7 CFR Part 718, will be evaluated and considered for their applicability. In compliance with Secretary's Memorandum No. 1955 and final report issued by the Secretary with respect to Executive Order 12044 and entitled \"Improving Government Regulations\" (43 FR 5098). it is determined after review of these and related regulations contained in 7 CFR Part 718 for need, currency, clarity, and effectiveness, that no additional changes be made at this time; and review of these regulations contained in 7 CFR Part 718 for need, currency, clarity, and effectiveness, is planned to take place within the five years subsequent to publication of these rules. Final Rule Accordingly, the regulations at 7 CFR Part 718 are amended as follows: 1. Section 718.1 is amended to read as follows: \u00a7 718.1 Applicability. The provisions of this part apply to compliance determinations for 1980 and subsequent years as authorized by the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended, and the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, with respect to the programs administered by theAgricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) through State and county committees. 2. Section 718.2 is amended by. (1) revising paragraph (b)(1); (2] revising paragraph (1b113]; (3) revising paragraph (b)(6); (4) deleting paragraph (b)(10); (5) redesignating paragraphs (b](11) through (b)(19) as paragraphs (b)(10) through (1b)(18); (6) adding a new paragraph (b)(19); and (7) adding a new paragraph (b)(21), to read as follows: \u00a7 718.2 Deftintons. (b) J (1) Admiristrative variance. For marketing quota crops, a prescribed amount within which the determined acreage can differ from a program requirement and still be considered as having met the program requiremenL (3) Determined acreage.

(6) Field assistant. Person employed to secure data necessary for ascertaining producer adherence to requirements for receiving program benefits as set forth inihis chapter. (19) Tolerance. For crops, other than sugar beets or sugar cane, which comprise the normal crop acreage (NCA), as provided for by 7 CFR 792.2, a prescribed amount within which the reported acreage can differ from the determined acreage or program requirements, and the reported acreage can still be considered as correctly reported. Also, the prescribed amount within which the determined acreage can vary from the program requirements and still be considered as having met the program requirements. (21) Variance. Administrative variance as it applies to marketing quota crops and tolerance as it applies to crops, other than sugar beets or sugar cane, which comprise the normal crop acreage (NCA). 3. Section 718.4 is amended by revising paragraph b)(l](v) and by revising paragraph (c) to revise the provision for Georgia and add a provision for Vermont as follows: \u00a7718.4 Committee responslbllttles.

One-tenth acre. Vermont Minimum row width- Thirty inches for corn for silage. 4. Section 718.5 is amended by revising paragraph (a)(3) and by revising paragraph (c) to read as follows: \u00a7 718.5 Producer services, (a)* * * (3) When the request is made in connection with'a late filed farm operator report of acreage and evidence of (i) the existence of the crop, (ii) the use made of the crop, (iii) the lack of. crop, or (iv) a disaster condition affecting the crop, is not available for inspection and acreage determinations. (c) Guaranteeing service. When a producer requests, pays for, and receives writtennotice that producer services have been furnished, compliance with program requirements relating to the measured acreage shall be guaranteed for the current year even if an error in the producer services is discovered in the measurement, placement of field or subdivision lines, planimetry or computations, when the producer has taken action based on the service and the entire crop or land use acreage required for the farm was measured. If the producer has not taken action based on the producer services, the producer shall be notified in writing that an error was discovered and the nature and extent of such error. In such cases, the corrected acreage will be used for determining program compliance for the current year. 5. Section 718.6 is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), 'deleting paragraph (a)(3), and revising to read as follows: -\u00a7 718.6 Determining farm operator adherence to program requirements. (a]* * * (1) Accepting a late filed report. A. farm operator's report may be accepted after the established date for reporting if evidence of (i) the existence of the crop, (ii) the use made of the crop, (iII) the lack of crop, or (iv) a disaster condition affecting the crop, is still evident for inspection and determination. The farm operator shall pay the cost of a farm visit by an authorized Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service employee unless the county committee determines that the producer's failure to file the farm operator's report was caused by a condition beyond the producer's control. (2) Revised report. The farm operator may revise a report of acreage to alter the acreage reported. Revised reports shall be used in accordance with instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator and accepted: (i) for all crops and land uses at any time provided evidence of the crop, use of the crop, lack of crop, or disaster condition, is still apparent; and (iI) for cotton and rice, to reflect that the harvested acreage'is less than the planted acreage any time up to furnishing production evidence to the county office. (c) * * * (1] Admiistrative variance. Administrative variance is applicable to all marketing quota crop acreages. Marketing quota crop acreages as determined in accordance with this 'Section 718.6 shall be deemed in compliance with the effective farm allotment or pfogram requirement (110 percent of the effective farm allotment for flue cured tobacco when agreement is made to leave four lower leaves unharvested) when determined acreage does not exceed the effective farm allotment by more than the larger-of 0.1 acre or 2 percent of the allotment. (2) Tolerance. Tolerance is applicable to those crops that comprise the normal crop acreage (NCA), except for sugar beets and sugar cane. For NCA crops for which price support is available, except sugar beets and sugar cane, program requirements shall be considered to have been met provided the reported acreage does not differ from the acreage determined in accordance with this part, or threported or determined acreage does not differ from program . requirements relating to NCA, set-aside or voluntary diversion by more than the larger of 1.0 acre or 5 percent of the reported acreage but not to exceed 40 acres. A reported acreage of an irrigated--and nonirrigated crop on the same farm be considered separately in applying the tolerance. (g) * (3) Adjustment Credit. Acreage may be adjusted for the purposes of program compliance as provided for in Section 718.11 of this part only when the areas on which the land use is altered are of reasonable shape and of reasonable number. In addition one of the following criteria must be met: (i) The area must be at least four links (approximately 32 inches) in width and contain at least 0.03 acre for tobacco or 0,1 acre for all other crops and land uses. If an area was ineligible for deduction, It may be enlarged to meet these minimum requirements for adjustment credit. (ii) An entire field or subdivision Is adjusted. (iii) The area being adjusted constitutes the total excess or deficientacreage of the crop or land uses for the farm. (iv) The area being adjusted Is the remaining area required for adjustment after adjusting entire fields or subdivisions. * * * * * 6. Section 718.11 is amended by revising paragraphs (b), (d), and (e) !o read as follows: \u00a7718.11 Adjustment of Acreages. (b) Peanuts. Thie farm operator may adjust an acreage of peanuts by disposing of the excess peanuts prior to combining, picking, or threshing any peanuts of the same type on the farm. Such disposition of excess peanuts must be accomplished by: (1) Leaving the peanuts in the ground. Peanuts disposed of in this manner may be hogged off. (2) Harvesting as green peanuts for boiling when the excess acreage is designated for disposal as green peanuts. (3) Plowing peanuts under before any peanuts are dug from the ground. The disposition of peanuts in this manner shall bewitnessed by a representative of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service when such peanuts could be harvested for nuts. (4] Plowing under or shredding, under the supervision of a representative or the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, dug peanuts: (i) Which are damaged to the extent that it would not be economically feasible to thresh the dug peanuts for nuts, or (ii) Which the county committee, with the concurrence of the State committee, Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations 76941 determined were in excess of the farm allotment and were inadvertently dug from the ground. (5) Any other method authorized by the Deputy Administrator and supervised by a representative of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service when unusual circumstances justify special handling. (d] ELS Cotton. The farm operator may adjust the acreage to the allotment before harvest begins. (e) NCA Crops and Set-Aside (including voluntary diversion). The farm operator may adjust- (i) NCA-crop acreage anytime before harvest; however, adjusting the acreage may not result in producer eligibility for payments based on the higher established \"target\" price as provided Tor by the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1980 unless adjustment is made: (A) before the final reporting date; and (B) provided the tolerance was not found to have been exceeded as a result of a farm inspection. (ii) Set-aside (including voluntary diversion) by designating additional acreage as set-aside or diverted acreage, provided the land meets, and has throughout the crop year met, all eligibility requirements.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established in Secretary's Memorandum 1955 to implement Executive Order 12044, and has been classified as \"not significant.\" Program title and number from the \"Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance\" is Rice Production Stabilization, 10.065. This action will not have a significant impact specifically on area and community development. Therefore, review as established by OMB Circular A-95 was not used to assure that units of local government are informed of this action. On Friday, July 18, 1980, a proposed rule was published (45 FR 48151) outlining the changed requirements relating to interest and inviting public comment. No comment was received, nor has any event changed the desirability of the change outlined therein. The proposed rule included changes applicable to the feed grain, upland cotton, and wheat programs. These changes will be included in a separate final rule. Under the current regulations, all payments made to producers under the rice program which are not earned by the producer must be refunded to the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS). Interest is not charged on these overpayments where a producer actually earned a part of the same type of payment (i.e., deficiency and disaster, diversion) for any crop or where the payment was erroneously made to a producer through no fault of that particular producer. Interest is charged in all other cases from the date of payment to the date of refund. The rate of interest charged is 7 percent per year. This final rule amends and supplements the current rules as follows: 1. The current rules do not distinguish between the producer who deliberately misrepresents a fact involving program requirements and the producer who does not. For example, when advance payments are made under the programs, a producer can receive an advance payment based on an honest intention to comply with the program requirements, change his or her mind, and have to refund the payment. This producer would currently be charged the same rate of interest as one who received advance payments under the programsbut never had any intention of complying with program requirements. Under this final rule, producers who are determined to have misrepresented a fact involving program requirements or who are determined to have engaged in a scheme or device ot defeat the purpose of the program would be liable for payment of interest on the principal amount of the program payment at the rate of 18 percent per year from the date of the payment to the date of the refund. 2. The current rules do not provide adequate incentive for a producer to refund overpayments made under the programs. Under the regulations now in effect, a producer is not charged interest with respect to program overpayments when a producer earns part of the same type of payment for any crop. Thus, the producer, in effect, has an interest-free loan until the overpayment is refunded. Under this final rule, a producer who does not refund an overpayment within 30 days from the billing date (date of the issuance of the letter demanding refund of the program overpayment) will be charged interest from the billing date until such refund is made. 3. The interest rate charged for overpayments has been unrealistically low. This final rule provides for interest to be charged at the rate of interest charged by CCC with respect to price support loans. These changes are in general conformance with the overall policy for the Federal Government set by the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR Part 1)M. Accordingly, the regulations appearing at 7 CFR Part 730 are amended as follows: Final Rule 1. Section 730.24 Is amended by revising paragraph (e) to read as follows: J 730.24 General payment provisions. * * * *b t (e) Uneamed Payments and Overpayments. The producer shall refund to Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) any amounts representing payments that exceed the payments actually earned under the programs prescribed by this part. Such refunds are due and payable to CCC with 30 days from the date of billing. (1) Effective with respect to determinations of overpayments made after enactment of this rule, refunds not made within 30 days from the date of billing are delinquent and shall accrue interest from the date billed until the date paid at the CCC commodity loan interest rate in effect on the billing date.

(iii) An overpayment involving voluntary diversion payments, if the' producer earns any voluntary diversion payment for any crop for the farm under Parts 713 or 730 of this chapter. (iv) An overphyment involving wheat grazing andhay payments, if the producer earns any wheat grazing and hay payment for the farm. - (2) Refunds not covered by paragraph (e)(1) of this section afid determined to be due CCC after enactment of this rule shall accrue interest from the date of disbursement until the date paid.

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action authorizes expenses and rate of assessment for the 1980-81 fiscal period, to be collected from handlers to support activities of theCalifornia Grapefruit Administrative Committee which locally administers the Federal marketing order covering grapefruit grown in southeastern California. DATES: Effective September 1, 1980, through August31.1981. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Malvin E. McGaha, Chief, Fruit Branch, F&V, AMS, USDA, Washington, D.C. 20250, telephone 202-447-5975. The Final Impact Statement relative to this final rule is available upon request from the above named individual. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final action has been reviewed under USDA procedures in Secretary's Memorandum 1955 to implement Executive Order 12044 and has been classified \"not significant.\" This final rule is issued 'under Marketing Order No. 904 (7 CFR Part 904; 45 FR 20046), regulating the handling of grapefruit grown in a designated area in California. This marketing order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674). This action is based upon recommendations and information submitted by the California Grapefruit Administrative Committee, and other available information. It is found that the expenses and rate of assessment, as hereinafter provided, will tend to effectuate the'declared policy of the act. This action was recommended at a public meeting at which all present could state their views. There is insufficient time between the date when ,information became available upon which this final rule is based and when the action must be taken to warrant a 60-day comment period as recommended in E.O. 12044, and it is impracticable and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice, 'engage in public rulemaking, and postpone the effective date until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 553). The order requires that the rate of assessment for a particular fiscal'period shall apply to all assessable fruit handled from the beginning of such period, which began September 1, 1980. To enable the committee to meet fiscal obligations which are now accruing, approval of the expenses and assessment rate is necessary without delay. It is necessary to effectuate the declared purposes of the act to make these regulatory provisions effective as specified, and handlers have been apprised of such provisions and the effective time. Therefore, a new \u00a7 904.200 is added to read as follows (this section is effective through August 31, 1981, and will not bepublished in the annual Code of Federal Regulations): \u00a7904.200 Expenses and rate of assessment. (a) Expenses that are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the California Grapefruit Administrative Committee during the period September 1, 1980, through August 31, 1981, will amount to $227,500. (b) The rate of assessment for said period payable by each handler in accordance with \u00a7 904.35 Is fixed at $0.065 per standard'carton (32 pounds net weight) of grapefruit, (Secs. 1-19,48 Stat. 31, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674)) Dated: November 18, 1080.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Findings. This regulation and amendment are issued under the marketing agreement, as amended, and Order No. 910, as amended (7 CFR Part 910), regulating the handling of lemons grown in California and Arizona, The agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601- 674). The action is based upon the recommendations and information submitted by the Lemon Administrative Committee and upon other available information. It is hereby found that this Federal Register / Vol. 46, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 1 Rules and Regulations action will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act. This action is consistent with the marketing poticyfer 1980-81 which was designated significant under the procedures of Executive Order 12044. The marketing policy was recommended by the committee following discussion at a public meeting on July 8,1980. A final impact analysis on the marketing policy is available from Malvin E. McGaha, Chief, Fruit Branch, F&V, AMS, USDA, Washington, D.C. 20250, telephone 202-447-5975. The committee met again publicly on November 18, 1980, at Los Angeles, California, to consider the current and prospective conditions of supply and demand and recommended a quantity of lemons deemed advisable to be handled during the specified weeks. The committee reports the demand for lemons has improved. It is further found that there is insufficient time between the date when information became available upon which this regulation and amendment are based and when the actions must be taken to warrant a 60 day comment period as recommended in E.O. 12044, and that it is impracticable and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice, engage in public rulemaking, and postpone the effective date until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 553), and the amendment relieves restrictions on the handling of lemons. It is necessary to effectuate the declared purposes of the act to make these regulatory provisions effective as specified, and handlers have been apprised of such provisions and the effective times. 1. Section 910.580 is added as follows: \u00a7 910.580 Lemon Regulation 280. (a) The quantity of lemons grown in California and Arizona which may be handled during the period November 23. 1980, through November 29, 1980, is established at 200,000 cartons. (b) As used in this section, \"handled\" and \"cartons\" mean the same as defined in the marketing order. 2. Paragraph (a) of \u00a7 910.579 Lemon Regulation 279 (45 FR 75164) is amended to read as follows: \u00a7 910.579 Lemon Regulation 279. (a) The quantity of lemons grown in California and Arizona which may be handled during the period November 16, 1980, through November 22, 1980, is established at 240,000 cartons.

The Impact Analysis relating to this final rule is available upon request from Mr. Porter. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Findings.This final action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established in Secretary's Memorandum 1955 to implement Executive Order 12044 and has been classified \"not significant.\" Pursuant to Marketing Order No. 959, as amended (7 CFR Part 959), regulating the handling of onions grown in South Texas, effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601--74), and upon the basis of the recommendations and information submitted by the committee, established under the marketing order, and upon other information, it is found that the expenses and rate of assessment, as hereinafter provided, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act. It is further found that it is impracticable and contrary to the public interest to provide 60 days for interested persons to file comments, engage in public rulemaking procedure, and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date until 30 days after publication (5 U.S.C. 553), as the order requires that the rate of assessment for a particular fiscal period shall apply to all assessable onions handled from the beginning of such period. Handlers and other interested persons were given an opportunity to submit information and views on the expenses and assessmentrate at an open meeting of the committee. To effectuate the declared purposes of the act it is necessary to make these provisions effective as specified. Section 959.220 (44 FR 53062. November 2,1979; 65379. November 13. 1979) is hereby deleted and a new \u00a7 959.221 Is added as follows: \u00a7959.221 Expenses and rate of assessmert (a) The reasonable expenses that are likely to be incurred during the fiscal period ending July 31,1981. by the South Texas Onion Committee for its maintenance and functioning and for such other purposes as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate will amount to $183,1. (b) The rate of assessment to be paid by each handler in accordance with this part shall be three cents ($0.03) per 50- pound container or equivalent quantity, of onions handled by him as the first handler thereof during the fiscal period. (c) Unexpended income in excess of expenses for the fiscal period may be carried over as a reserve. (d) Terms used in this section have the same meaning as whefi used in the marketing agreement and this part. (Secs. 1-19. 48 Stat. 31. as amended: 7 U.S.C. 801-674) Dated. November 18.1960. D. S.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Exemption from Executive Order 12044 This final rule has been reviewed under USDA procedures established in Secretary's Memorandum 1955 to implement Executive Order 12044 and has been determined to be exempt from those requirements. Dr. Donald L. Houston made this determination because the Executive Order does not apply to matters relating to Agency management. Background The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 provides for the collection of fees approximately equal to the cost of providing Federal meat grading and certification services. Salaries paid to Federal employees have been increased under the provisions of Executive Order 12248. Therefore, it has been determined that in order to cover the increased costs of providing Federal meat grading and certification services, including salaries paid to Federal employees and other associated costs of administering the program, the hourly fee must be increased as provided herein. Pursuant to the authority of sections 203 and 205 of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1622. 1624) the provisions of 7 CFR 2853.27(a) prescribing fees for Federal meat grading and certification services are hereby amended by changing the phrases \"$18.20 per hour,\" \"$22.20 per hour,\" and \"$40.40 per hour\" (See. 203. 206, 60 Stat. 1087,1090, 7 U.S.C. 1622, 16241 Therefore, pursuant to the authority in 5 U.S.C. 553 it is found that notice and other public procedure with respect tothese amendments are impracticable and unnecessary and good cause is found for making these amendments effective December 28, 1980.

Currently, such information is submitted to the Food Safety and Quality Service (FSQS) each week. In its proposal the Department had suggested an annual reporting period. Following a review of the comments submitted in response to the proposal, the Department has determined, however, that quarterly reporting of MP Form 404 data provides. a more adcurate reporting system and reflects seasonality in the data.

McCutcheon, Director, Policy and Program Planning, Food- Safety and Quality Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 327-E, Agriculture Administration Building, Washington, D.C. 20250, (202) 447-6525. The Final Impact Statement describing the options considered in developing this final rule and the impact of implementing each option is available on request from the above-named individual. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Significance This final rule has been reviewed under the USDA procedures established in Secretary's Memorandum. No.-1955 to implement Ekecutive Order 12044 and has been classified \"significant\" Background The requirement that statistics on the production volume of processed meat and meat food products be compiled and regularly submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture dates back to the inception of the Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1907. Since then, FSQS and its predecessor agencies have received weekly reports from each official establishment indicating the amount, by category, of meat and meat food products produced. The number of categories of products required to be reported on has increased over the years as the-variety of products produced has increased. The number of products reported varied between 24 and 28 during 1917-1932 and 1935-1946. Sliced bacon production was ' incorporated into the processing report in 1937.and canning operations were specifically segregated and categorized in 1948. Since that time the report has been continually expanded. It currently ipcludes 110 product categori.ep organized into nine major groups: Cured Products, Smoked or Dried or Cooked Products, Sausage, Sliced/PackagedA.Products, Fresh or Frozen Products. Convenience Foods, Fats and Oils, Miscellaneous Meat Products, and Canned Products. The AP Form 404 serves some purposes in assisting the Food Safety and Quality Service to perform its regulatory function, The Meat and Poultry Inspection Program (MPI) management and field services occasionally use MP Form 404 data to supplement other information for inspection tasks and manpower -planning. The Processed Products Inspection Division of MPI uses information from MP Form404 as a tool to monitor processed products prodii\"tion. Processing production data are also used by the Food Ingredient Assessment Division in FSQS' Science Program and the Meat and Poultry Standards and Labeling Division in the Compliance Program. The data collected are used by FSQS for the President's Budget and Explanatory Notes and the Secretary's Report to Congress on the Meat and Poultry Inspection Program. The data are also used by a number of other Federal agencies, the industry, and educational or research organizations. For a more detailed explanation of the uses of MP Form 404 data, see the Final Impact Statement. Paperwork and Cost Reduction. The administration of MPI including- the maintenance of the MP Form 404 requirement, was-transferred to the Food Safety and Quality Service in March 1977. In an effort to carry out previous commitments made by its predecessor agencies, FSQS scheduled a reduction in the reporting frequencylof MP Form 404 on January 1, 1978, from weekly to monthly. Uncertainty over the fate of the weekly sliced bacon report and associated impacts on-pork belly futures, however, led to a postponement of the action and further review. The interest of the Federal Government in reducing the paperwork burden on industry has been most apparent in the last 4-5 years. In March 1976, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directed all executive departments and agencies to institute a two-phase plan to reduce the Federal paperwork burden on the public. The first phase called for a 10 percent reduction in the number of Federal forms and reports by June 30, 1976. The second phase called for a 5 and a 15-20 percent reduction in th& number of hours .spent by the public in official recordkeeping by September 1977 and 1978, respectively. Discussions of the MP Form 404 surfaced in the latter phase. At the time the Federal paperwork reduction campaign came into being,MPI was organizationally a part of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The MP Form 404 was one of the few recurring reports maintained by that Agency. At the time, the annual number of respondents to MP Form 404 was estimated at 5,800. Using 30 minutes as a preliminary estimate of the average time required to complete the form, the .Department estimated its associated paperwork burden on the public to be 150,800 hours per year.I Industry Viewpoints. Following the expansion of MP Form 404 in 1977 to encompass 110 product categories, the Department received strong criticism from the Pacific Coast Meat Association, Incorporated, which represents small meatpackers. This trade group maintained that It had been excluded from discussions concerning revisions of the form, and It questioned the continued use of the form by the Department as previously conceived. The group also stated that the addition of new product categories appeared to assist major meatpacking companies developing data for production and marketirg needs. More generally, the requirement was characterized as an unnecessary intrusion in the marketplace 'which could jeopardize the confidential nature of some production data. The Department also received correspondence from trade associations representing the large meatpackers-tho National Independent Meat Packers Association and the American Meat Institute-which are in support of retaining MP Form 404 on a weekly basis. Similarly, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFrC has indicated its strong concern at the prospect of reducing this report to less * than a weekly basis. It believes that the commodity trader, who uses the figures to assess the flow of meat through the marketplace, will be disadvantaged by any change in reporting frequency. The issue of confidentiality and the release of slaughter and processing data has been under review within the Department for over a year. In 1978, a determination was made by the Department that data concerning slaughtering operations more than I year old, and data concerning processing operations more than 2 years old, did not appear to meet exemption requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which protect trade secrets and-certain confidential, c6mmercial information (5 U.S.C. 'Additional investigation found that It took approximately 15 minutes for plant personnel to complete MP Form 404 rather than the 30 mlnutes at' preliminarily estimated. Federal Begister I VoL 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21. 1980 / Rules and Regulations 555)(4). Theeafter numerous represeutatves of meat processors, poultry pneessors, and trade associations objected to this requirment, contending such data were just as sensitive and confidential as more current data, and release of the data would injure competition. On December 15, 1978, the Department responded to the representatives! complaint by publishing a notice in the Federal Register (43 FR 58695) which stated that the Department's position was under review and requested interested persons to submit comments. That status remains unchanged. Change to Quarterly Reporting on MP Form 404 Data In its proposal, the Department recognized that significant cost savings could be realized if the reporting period for W Form 404 were changed from a weekly basis. The Department considered four other alternatives. It appeared that annual reporting would produce the greatest cost savings, while meeting the Department's regulatory needs. After reviewing the comments on the proposal, the Department has determined to require the collection of data on MP Form 404 on a quarterly basis. Quarterly reporting will lead to cost savings to the Agency of approximately $160,000 per year, and to industry of approximately $385,000 per year. These cost savings are still significant and will permit the Department to obtain accurate statistics which provide an indication of seasonality. Comments The Department received 27 comments on the proposal which was published in the March 25, 1980, Federal Register (45 FR 19258-19263). Comments received represent the views of 16 individual inspected meat or poultry processors. 6 related trade associations, 2 government entities, a commodity exchange, an economic and management consultant to meat processors, and a consumer. Twelve comments (8 from industry, 2 from related trade associations, 1 from government, and 1 from a consumer) favored the proposal, citing several reasons. Most-pointed out that data from MP Form 444 is not necessary on a weekly basis. Furthermore, money and manpower saved by both industry and government will offset any advantages that may be obtained from a weekly report. The consumer comment stated that lower administrative costs to both industry and government may lower meat prices, which would be a welcomed result in these inflationarytimes. Finally, the Council of Economic Advisors supports the Department's view that regulatory.agencies should only gather data directly related to their mission. Fifteen ommenters (8 from industry, 4 from related trade associations, 1 from governmert, I from a consultant to meat processors, and 1 from a commodity exchange) opposed the proposal, citing several reasons.1Most argued that information contained in the weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual reports that are published utilizing MP Form 404 data is important to industry in compiling short term demand-supply functions for the meat industry. These indicators are used by individual firms to gauge their operation with industry trends and to plan future production goals. The comments state that often data used to fill out MP Form 404 are collected by industry as part of in-house management systems. Therefore, very little burden Is imposed upon industry in collecting this information. These comments also point out that yearly reporting of M Form 404 data will cause the development of alternative, duplicative industry systems, at great expense, in order to provide management data necessary for the proper conduct of business. It is stated that these costs or the costs related to an added safety margin to guard against unduly wide price savings within the market will offset any potential consumer savings resulting from reducing the frequency of reporting on M Form 404. Finally, a trade association comments that the Department failed to place a value on the guidance that plant management receives from the weekly W Form 404 reports. The Department recognizes that industry uses these statistics for inventory control production scheduling and market planning. The Department also recognizes the uses of the report by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Department of Labor in interpreting consumer price trends and realizes its responsibility to provide information on the industry it regulates. However, the principal role of a regulatory agency such as FSQS is to protect the public health and to provide needed information on its regulated industry at the lowest level required for 2Approxlmately z weeks after the close of the comment period. a omment was received from an industry member who had previously commetted in favor of reduced reportin ofOMP Form 40L This comment stated opposition to the Depardment's action on reduced reporting frequency orMP 404, indicating that the previous comment had been sent in error, through a misunderstanding of the fU ramifications of the Department's acbon This change has been reflected in the abo% e analysis.decisionmaking, it should not use its regulatory authority to gather data on its regulated industry unless the utility of the data can be directly linked to its regulatory mission. As long as a regulatory need for data exists, having the data available for other uses is reasonable, so long as these uses do not interfere with the regulatory mission or cause harm to the firms that supply the information. The Department has determined that it does not need the information obtained from M Form 404 on a weekly basis. As stated previously, quarterly reports will serve its needs. Industry and trade association comments indicate concern that information on an annual M Form 404 report will have less value to government officials because annual reporting may reduce accuracy and will fail to show weekly, monthly and - seasonal variations. Furthermore, these comments state that the weekly reporting of production volume or processed meat products is directly linked to agency and departmental needs. Annual reporting, it is claimed, will leave unfilled agency needs that will have to be met by a new, undefined and untried system. Such a system will likely impose added, rather than fewer industry burdens and costs. The Department has concluded that obtaining accurate data is necessary and the reflection of seasonality in the data is important. In particular, a reflection of seasonality provides the Department with data on which to base its assignment of inspectors where seasonal changes in production may affect inspection needs. Therefore, the Department has provided for the quarterly reporting of the MP Form 404 data in its final regulation. The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services expresses a concern that the collection of M Form 404 data only once a year will affect the data gathering capabilities of State and Federal regulatory agencies. This comment further regrets the potential loss of an evaluation tool for inspection service administrators to estimate workloads and to develop employee assignment schedules. The Department is aware that State inspection service administrators may use information from M Form 404 reports to estimate workload and develop employee assignment schedules. As stated above, MPI management also uses this data to supplement other information for Inspection and manpower planning where questions of seasonality exist. The reflection of seasonality in the reports, as provided by the finalI II I76967 76968 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations regulation, should ensure thatothe , effectiveness of both MPI and State program manpower mandgement will not be reduced. 0 The ChicagoMercantile Exchange points out that the Federal Register notice stated that \"Uncertainty over the fate of the weekly sliced bacon report and associated impacts on pork belly futures * * * led to a postponement of (a previous) action (to reduce the reporting frequency of MP Form 404 to monthly) * * \" Yet, commented the Exchange, nothing in the impact statement addresses the impact on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of reduced reporting on pork belly futures. The Department recognizes the use of MP Form 404 data by the CFTC to develop price guiding supply indices to monitor pork belly futures and to monitor daily market surveillance activities. This is addressed in-the Final Impact Statement by a recognition that although CFTC officials would prefer weekly statistics, CFTC indices could be made based on monthly or quarterly data. The Pacific Coast Meat Association mentions the need for confidentiality of MP Form 404 data on an individual company basis through FOIA requests. This commenter further requested that ' the Agency reduce industry burden and paperwork by reducing the number of products reported in MP Form 404 to pre-1976 levels. As indicated previously, the Department is presently reviewing the issue of the protection of M Form 404 data from FOIA requests and intends to address that issue separately at a later date. Furthermore, as stated in the impact\" statement, although the number of products reported in the MP Form 404 has increased over the years, this has been done to reflect changing production patterns in the types of products processed. In 1978, the weekly average number of different product categories reported per establidhment was seven out of 110 categories; the Department does not consider this to be an unreasonable burden. Industry and trade associations suggest that thought should be given to reducing the collection of MP Form 404 data to a monthly basis, at least for a trial period. After that trial period, if - further reduction in reporting frequency appears appropriate, then quarterly collection, then biannually, and finally collection annually of data should be considered. For the reasons previously discussed, the Department has considered this approach to'be inappropriate. Comments also express awillingness to work with FSQS to simplify MIP Form 404 and to investigate other ways to reduce industry burden and paperwork. Impact of Proposal. The greatest impact will be on the 6,300 official establishments which now submit a weekly report of production figures. The total annual reporting burden for these establishments is estimated-to be 70,000 persons/hpurs based on time estimates of 15 minutes per form. It is also likely that there would be a secondary impact on nongovernmental users of the statistical data. The full effect of the proposed regulation on these parties, however, cannot now be assessed by the Department. In formulating the proposal, the Department considered three other options in addition to the proposed annual requirement and the adopted quarterly requirement. These were: 1. Retention of the weekly report; 2. Monthly reporting; and 3. Elimination of the requirement entirely.3 The Department has concluded that-the option selected should be the one that provides the necessary regulatory information in the least burdensome manner, with the greatest cost savings possible. In view of the concerns expressed by some segments of the regulated industry, balanced against the need to reduce the paperwork burden on the meat industry and the Federal Government, which will result in cost savings to both, the Department has changed its original proposal to collect MP Form 404 data annually and now has decided that a quarterly collection of this data is more appropriate. Need for Amendment to the Code of Federal Regulations. The authority to require reports is contained in section 407 of-the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 677], which incorporates by reference provisions of the Federal -z Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 46,48, 49 and 50]. Under this authority, the failure to file a required report could result in a penalty of $100 a day each day the report is overdue (21 U.S.C. 077). General rulemaking authority is contained in section 21 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 621). Currently, the regulations do not specifically require reporting of production figures. In order to assure proper enforcement, \u00a7 320.6 of the Federal meat inspection regulations (9 CFR 320.6) is amended to require that production reports be filed on a quarterly basis. 5These options are discussed and analyzed in greater detail in the Agency's approved Final Impact Statement.Therefore, 9 320.6 of the Federal moat Inspection regulations (9 CFR 320.0) is amended by redesignating the present paragraph (b) as paragraph (c), and adding a new paragraph (b) as follows: \u00a7 320.6 Information and reports required from official establishment operators. [b) The operator of each official establishment shall report quarterly the number of pounds of meat and meat food product produced at that establishment. The report shall be made on a form-furnished by the Administrator and shall'be submitted to an inspector at the establishment. Each report shall cover a calendar quarter and shall be filed within 15 days after the end of each quarter.

U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: In March 1977, the Commission published for public comment proposed amendments to establish criteria and procedures for determining eligibility for access to or control over special nuclear material, As a result of public and staff comments, the record of an informal Hearing, and the recommendations of the Hearing Board, the scope of the proposed amendnients has been harrowed to include only those fuel cycle facilities and transportation activities that use, process, or store formula quantities of special nuclear material. Light water reactors, non-power reactors, and facilities possessing only Irradiated special nuclear material subject to the exemption of \u00a7 73.6(b) are not covered by these revised amendments. The Nuclear Regulatory commission is now Federal Register I Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations publishing these revised amendments in final form.

Frank Gillespie or Jim Prell, Office of Standards Development, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 205s, Phone: 301-443-5907. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 161i of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. as amended, permits the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to prescribe regulations instituting a clearance program for those individuals who have access to or control over special nuclear material. Specifically, the section provides that the Commission may issue regulations \" * * designating activities involving quantities of special nuclear material which in the opinion of the Commission are important to the common defense and security, that may be conducted only by persons whose character, associations and loyalty shall have been investigated under standards and specifications established by the commission and as to whom the commission shall have determined that permitting each such person to conduct the activity will not be inimical to the common defense and security * * *.\" Pursuant to this statutory authority and after consideration of the results of public comments, the record developed in an informal hearing, and the recommendations of the hearing board, the Commission is issuing regulations which would require certain individuals involved in the operation of licensed fuel reprocessing plants, in the licensed use, processing, or storage of certain quantities of special nuclear materials, and in the transportation by the private sector of certain quantities of special nuclear material, to receive authorization from the Commission for access to or control over special nuclear material. Nuclear power reactors licensed pursuant to 10 CFR Part 501 are not covered by these amendments. They will be the subject of a separate rulemaking to include a notice and comment period. Additionally, non- power reactors and storage of fuel incident thereto, have been excluded from the requirements of these amendments pending completion of a separate ongoing review of total safeguards requirements adequacy at such facilities. When that assessment is complete, considerations of access authorization requirements will be included in the evaluation of overall safeguards upgrading which may be considered necessary for these facilities. IExcept for the Fort St. Vrain facility.Finally, facilities possessing formula quantities of special nuclear material only in the form of irradiated special nuclear material subject to the exemption of J 73.6(b) are also excluded from these requirments as the Commission concludes that the risk of theft or diversion of such material is minimal. This is consistent with other safeguards requirements for irradiated special nuclear material. These regulations utilize a personnel security program as a measure to protect against those employed in the affected nuclear acitivities who might conspire to steal or divert special nuclear material or conduct sabotage which would endanger the public by exposure to radiation. Of course, a clearance program itself does not entirely solve the problem of the \"insider,\" but, in the opinion of the commission, experience has shown that such programs do substantially reduce the risk. Moreover, the proposed prograin is one of several elements in the commission's overall safeguards program which together protect against threats, both internal and external. Two levels of special nuclear material access authorization are established. The higher level. NRC-U, is based upon a full-field background investigation and will apply to (i) all individuals who require unescorted access to special nuclear material or within vital areas, (ii) those jobs in which an individual alone or in conspiracy with another individual who does not possess an NRC-U special nuclear material access authorization could act to steal or divert special nuclear material or to commit sabotage, and (iii) drivers of motor vehicles and pilots of aircraft transporting certain quantities of special nuclear material and those who escort road, rail, air or sea shipments of special nuclear material. The lower level. NRC- R, is based upon a National Agency Check and will apply to all individuals who require unescorted access to protected areas and who are not required to possess an NRC-U special nuclear material access authorization. An implementation schedule has been established to account for changed estimates of the time required to process access authorization applications (190 days for an NRC \"U\" and 130 days for an NRC \"'R\") and for the initial flow of applications. Jobs at fixed sites requiring access authorization will be identified by licensee submittal of an amendment to the security plan. For jobs not requiring an amended security plan, affected individuals must have the required access authorization within 365days of the effective date of the amendments. All others must have authorization 365 days after having the amended security plan approved designating those jobs which require access authorization. Excepted from the 365.day implementation in all cases are those who initially apply but have not received notification due to Commission processing time. Both the National Agency Check and the full-field background investigation are conducted by the Office of Personnel Management. The National Agency check consists of a check of files of the FBI (fingerprint and central files), Office of Personnel Management (Security- Investigative index), and a check of military records and records of other government agencies, as appropriate. The full-field background investigation consists of interviews of references, conducted by investigative agents of the Office of Personnel Management, in addition to the records check. Sources of information developed in the course of the investigation are also interyiewed. The full-field background investigation conducted by the Office of Personnel Management generally covers the 5-year period of the individual's adult life prior to the investigation. Licensees and license applicants will be required to amend their security plans by identifying and describing jobs at their facilities which require authorization. Affected individuals will be required to obtain authorization according to the schedules set forth in the proposed rule. Individuals who are newly hired or who change jobs where the new job will require a material access authorization must obtain an authorization before beginning the job. Authorization will be renewed every 5 years. The establishment of a material access authorization program in the licensed nuclear industry will affect individuals who are not employed by any licensee or contractor of the Commission as well as licensee employees. It is the Commission's intent to minimize both the impact on the rights of privacy and association of individuals affected, and the number of individuals affected, while providing an effective measure of protection against those who would seek employment with. or use their position in, the nuclear industry for purposes of theft or sabotage. In preparing these regulations, among the matters considered were the scope of investigations (e.g., whether a full-field background investigation should be required for all individuals). which job functions should require76969 76970 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and ReguWtions material access authorization (e.g., require authorization only for \"key\" positions or adopt a graded system .vith level of clearance determined by job), whether psychological assessment should be required, and the relation of the proposed program to current NRC and DOE personnel security programs. Th& Commission also considered the question of whether new criteria should be developed against which a decision for authorization would be made. The present NRC security clearance, criteria (10 CFR Part 10) were developed for access to classified information and, as such, not all criteria may.be equally significant for questions of access to special nuclear material, and some may not be perceived as relevant in specific cases. Also, there may be cases in which additional criteria, not now included in \" 10 CFR Part 10, would be more to the point. However, these criteria do correspond to the Federal Government's general approach to personnel security, and specifically, they are presently used for DOE access authorization programs. Furthermore, the criteria are in the nature of guidelines to be used in a decision process characterized by common sense judgments, ra her than * quantitative criteria. Moreover, the Commission is reluctant to devise a new set of criteria without evidence that such new criteria would significantly improve upon those which presently 6xist. The Commission notes, however, that the Department of Energy is currently reviewing the criteria applicable to access to Restricted Data and Material and the Commission will review its own criteria in 10 CFR Part 10 in light of any revision made by the Department of Energy in 10 CFR Part 710. Hence, in light of the above, the Commission is relying on the considerable expeftise residing in the broad experience of the Federal Government in the area of personnel securit; programs by proposing the use of the criteria contained in 10 CFR Part 10 as guidelines in deciding questions of access to or control over special nuclear material. Pursuant to the AtomicEnergy Act of 1954, as amended, by the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, and section 553 of title 5 of the United States Code, notice is hereby given that a new 10 CFR Chapter I, Part 11, and the following conforming amendments to 10 CFR Chapter I, Parts 50 and 70-are publisheid as a document subject to codification. 1. A new Part 11 is added to read as follows:PART 11-CRITERIA AND PROCEDURES FOR DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY FOR ACCESS TO OR CONTROL OVER SPECIAL NUCLEAR MATERIAL General Provisions Sec. 11.1 Purpose. 11.3 Scope. 11.5 Policy. 11.V Definitions. 11.9 Specific exemptions.

General Provisions \u00a7 11.1 Purpose., This part establishes the requirements for special nuclear material access authorization, and the criteria and procedures for resolving questions concerning the eligibility of individuals to receive special nuclear-material access authorization for conductof certain activities, licensed or otherwise, which involve access to or control over special nuclear material. \u00a7 11.3 Scope. (a) The requirements, criteria, and procedures of this part apply to the establishment of and eligibility for special nuclear material access authorization for employees, contractors, consultants of, and applicants for employment with, licensees or contractors of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission where such employment, contract, service, or consultation involves any job falling within the criteria of'\u00a7 11.11 or \u00a7 11.13. (b) The requirements, criteria, and procedures of this part are in addition to and not in lieu of any requirements, criteria, or procedures for access to or control over classified special nuclear material. \u00a7 11.5 Policy. It is the policy of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to carry out its authority to establish and administer, in a manner consistent with traditional American concepts of justice, a personnel security program in the interests of the common defense andsecurity for the purpose of safeguarding special nuclear material and preventing sabotage which would endanger the public by *exposure to radiation. To this end, the Commission has established criteria for determining eligibility for special nuclear material access authorization and will afford affected individuals the opportunity for administrative review of questions concerning their eligibility for special nuclear material access authorization. \u00a7 11.7 Definitions. As used in this part: (a) Terms defined in Parts 10, 25, 50, 70, 73, and 95 of this chapter have the same meaning when used in this part.

(c) \"NRC-'U' special nuclear material access authorization\" means an administrative determination based upon a national agency check and a full. field background investigation conducted by the Office of Personnel Management that an individual in the course of employment is eligible to work at a job falling within the criteria of \u00a7 11.11(a)(1) or \u00a7 11.13. (d) \"NRC--'R' special nuclear material access authorization\" means an administrative determination based upon a national agency check that an individual in the course of employment is eligible to work at a job falling within the criterion of \u00a7 11.11(a)(2). \u00a7 11.9 Specific exemptions. The Commission may, upon applicatioi of any interested party, grant an exemption from the requirements of this Part. Exemptions will be granted only if they are authorized by law and will not constitute an undue risk to the common defense and security. Documentation related to the request, notification and processing of an exemption shall be maintained for two years beyond the period covered by the exemption.

Material access authorization fees will be published in December of each year and will be applicable to each access authorization request received during the following calendar year. Applications fromindividuals having, current Federal access authorizations may beprocessed expeditiously at less cost, since the Commission may accept the investigations and reports of other Federal Government agencies which conduct personnel security investigations. The use of such investigations and reports'-is contingent upon their serving as the basis for a previous clearance approval. Criteria for Determining Eligibilitj for' Access to or Control Over, Special Nuclear Material \u00a7 11.21 Application of the criteria. (a) The decision to grant or deny special nuclear material access authorization is a comprehensive, common-sense judgment, made after consideration of all therelevant information, favorable or unfavorable, that to grant or deny special nuclear material access authorization is or is not inimical to the common defense and security and is or is not. clearly consistent with the national interesL (b) To assist in making these determinations, on the basis of all the information in a particular case, there are set forth in \u00a7 10.11-,' of this chapter a number of specific types'of derogatoryinformation. These criteria are not exhaustive but contain the principal types of.derogatory information which in the opinion of the'Commission create a question as to-the individual's eligibility for special nuclear material access authorization. These criteria are subject to continuing review and rhay be revised'from time to time as experience arjd circumstances may make desirable. (c) When the reports of investiga'tion of an individual contain information reasonably fallirg within one or more of the classes of derogatory information listed in \u00a7 10.11. it shall create a question as to the individual's eligibility for special nuclear material access authorization. In such cases, the application of the criteria shall be made in light of and with specific regard to whether the existence of such information supports a reasonable belief that the granting of a special nuclear material access authorization would be inimical.to-the common defenseand security. The Director, Division of Security may authorize the granting of special nuclear material access authorization on the basis of the information in the case or may authorize' the conduct of an-interview with the individual and, on-the basis of such interview and such other investigation as he deems appropriate, may authorize the granting of special nuclearmaterial access authorization. Otherwise.a question concerning the eligibility-of an individual for special nuclear material access authorization shall be resolved in accordance with the procedurep set forth in \u00a7 \u00a7 10.20 through 10.37 of this chapter. --- (d) In resolving a question concerning the eligibility or continued eligibility of an individual for special nuclear material access authorization by action of the Personnel Security Board,4 the following principle shall be applied by the Board: Where there are grounds sufficient to establish a reasonable belief as to the truth of the information regarded as substantially derogatory \"and when the existence of such information supports a reasonable belief that granting access would be inimical -to the common defense and security, this shall be the basis for a recommendation for denying or revoking special nuclear material access authorization if not satisfactorily rebutted by the individual or shown to be mitigated by circumstance. 4The function of the Personnel Security Board is described in Part 10 of this chapter;PART 50-DOMESTIC LICENSING OF PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION * FACILITIES -2.

(I) Technical Changes The technical amendments announced today are adopted in order (i) to amend certain rules, forms, and schedules under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act to reflect the recent adoption or amendment of certain other rules and forms under those Acts, (ii) to revise certain cross-references in the rules, forivs and schedules under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act which have become outdated by reason of the adoption of uniform disclosure items in Regulation S-K; (iii) to correct certain inadvertent omissions and typographical errors made in connection with the recent adoption and amendment of Regulation S-X, Regulation S-K, and certain rules and forms under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act; and (iv) to clarify certain terminology and instructions used in certain rules and-forms under the Exchange Act. The recent adoption-and amendment of certain rules and forms under the Securities Act and the Exqhange Act have necessitated the amendment of certain other rules and forms in minor respects. For example, Instruction 3 to Item 6 of Regulation S-K, providing for standard disclosure of the security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management, states that the registrant shall be deemed to know the contents of any statements filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act. In order to reflect recent amendments to Rule 13d-1(b) (1 7 CFR 240.13d-1(b)) ' which provide that after December 31, 1978, certain beneficial owners must file a Schedule 13G, the first-sentence of Instruction 3 is changed to read: \"The registrant shall be deemed to know the contents of any statements filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(d) or 13(g) of the Exchange Act.\" 2 'See Exchange Act Release No. 34-14692 (April 21, 1978) (43 FR 18484). 2Comparable changes are as follows: The reference to General Instruction H of Form 10-K in Instruction 4 to Item 3(b) of Regulation S IC is changed to refer to General Instruction G of Form 10-K in order to reflect recent amendments to Form 10-K (See Securities Act Release No. 6231 (September 2, 19801 (45 FR 63630)); the reference to \"dividends paid\" in paragraph (c) of Item 9 of Regulation S-K is changed to \"dividends declared\" in order to reconcile the language used in Item 9 with the language used in Item 10 of Regulation S-K (See Securities Act Release No. 6231 (September 2, 1980) (45 FR 63630)); the reference to Items 26, 27, 28 and 30 of Form S-1 in paragraph (b) of General Instruction G to Form S-1 is changed to refer to Items 25, 26, 27 and 29 of Form S-1 in order to reflect the renumbering of S-1 items (See SecuritiesSimilarly, the adoption of standard disclosure items in Regulation S-K required change in a number of cross- references in the rules, forms and schedules under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. For example, Instruction 3 to Item 1 of Form S-11 (17 CFR 239.18), providing for disclosure of the distribution spread of the securities being registered, instructs the registrant, if any of the securities being registered are to be offered for the account of security holders, to set forth following the distribution table a reference to the information called for by Instruction 4 to Item 18. To reflect the revision of Item 18 of Form S-11 to incorporate by reference the requirements of Item 6 of Regulation S-K (Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management), Instruction 3 to Item1 of Form S-11 is amended to refer to the applicable instruction in Item 6of Regulation S-Ks Act Release No. 5949 (July 28, 1978) (45 FR 34402) and Securities Act Release No. 6019 (January 30. 1979) (44 FR 7864)); Instruction 2 to Item 14 of Form S-1 which refers to Form S-9 is deleted to reflect the rescission of Form S-9 (See Securities Act Release No. 5791 (December 20, 1976) (41 FR 56301)); the reference to Item 21 of Form S-1 in Instruction (b) for Summary Prospectuses in Form S-1 is changed to refer to Item 19 of Form S-1 in order to reflect the renumbering of S-1 items (See Securities Act Release No. 5949 (July 28, 1978) (43 FR 34402)); the requirement that a registrant submit two marked copies of a registration statement on Form S-8 found in General Instruction F to Form S-8 is changed to require the submission of one marked copy in order to reflect the recent amendment of Form S-8 and Rule 464 (17 CFR 230.464)40 provide for automatic effectiveness (See Securities Act Release No. 6190 (February 22, 1980) (45 FR 13438)); the reference to Item 22(b) of Form S-11 in paragraph (d) of Supplemental Information Required by Form S-11 is changed to refer to Item 21(b) of Form S-l1 in order to reflect the renumbering of S- 11 items (See Securities Act Release No. 5949 (July 28, 1978) (43 FR 34402)); the reference to Instruction 3(b) of Instructions as to Financial Statements of Form 10-K in Rule 1Zb-25(f)(1) is changed to refer to Rule 3-09(a) of Regulation S-X in order to reflect the relocation of that Instruction from Form 10-K to Regulation S-X (See technical amendment to Rule 3.09(a) of Regulation S-X described in note 7 infra)); the reference to Form 20 in Instruction 1 to Item 9 of Schedule 14d-i is changed to refer to Form 20-F in order to reflect the recent substitution of Form 20-F (17 CFR 240.220f) for Form 20 (See Exchange Act Release No. 16371 (November 29, 1979) (44 FR 70132)). 3 Comparable changes occasioned by the adoption of Regulation S-K are as follows: The cross-reference to Item 19(a) in General Instruction F of Form S-i is changed to refer to Item 6(a) of Regulation S-K- the cross-reference to Item 19(a) in. Item 21 of Form S-4 is changed to refer to Item 6(a) of Regulation S-K; the cross-reference to Item 18(b) of Form S-1 in Instruction (a) for Summary Prospectuses in Form S-1 is changed to refer to Item 4(d) of Regulation S-K; the cross-reference to Item 18(a) of Form S-11 in paragraph (a) of Supplemental Information Required by Form S-11 is changed to refer to Item 6(a) of Regulation S-K; the cross- reference to Part II of Form 10-K in paragraph (b) of General Instruction A to Form S-7 are changed to refer to Items 3, 4 and 6 of Regulatidn S-K; the cross-reference to Items 16, 17, 19 and 20 of Form S- I in paragraph (a) of General Instruction G to FormIn the adoption of recent amendments to the rules and forms, inadvertent omissions and typographical errors were made which require correction as soon as possible. For example, when Item 11 (Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) was recently added to Regulation S-K, Guides 1 and 22 to the Preparation and Filing of Registration Statements and Periodic Rdports (17 CFR 231.4936) requiring similar information in Securities Act and Exchange Act filings were withdrawn. However, when the forms, rules and schedules under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act were amended to incorporate by reference new Item 11,4 amendment of Item 14 of Schedule 14A was inadvertently omitted. Item 14 of Schedule 14A, therefore, is revised by these technical amendments to incorporate by reference the information S-7 is changed to refer to Items 3, 4, and 6 of Regulation S-K; the cross-reference to Item 19(a) of Form S-1 in paragraph (a) of General Instruction G to Form S-7 is changed to refer to Item 6(a) of Regulation S-K: the cross-reference to Items 16-20 of Form S-1 in Item 10-of Form S-7 is changed to refer to Items 3, 4 and 6 of Regulation S-K; the cross-reference to Part II of Form 10-K in Undertaking D of Form S-7 is changed to refer to Items 3, 4.and 6 of Regulation S-K; the cross- reference to Items 16-20 of Form S-1 in Item 8(b) of Form S--16 is changed to refer to Items 3, 4 and 6 of Regulation S-K; the cross-references to Item 7(a) of Schedule 14A in Item 9 of Schedule 14A are changed to refer to Item 4(a) of Regulation S-K; the cross- reference to Item 7 of Schedule 14A in Item 9 of Schedule 14A is changed to refer to Item 4 of Regulation S-K; the cross-reference to Instruction I to Item 7(b) of Schedule 14A in Instruction I to Item 9 of Schedule 14A is changed to refer to Instruction 6 of Item 4(a) of Regulation S-K: the cross- references to Items 7(d) (1) and (2) of Schedule 14A in Instruction 3(c) to Item 9 of Schedule 14A are changed to refer to Item 4(d) (1) and (21 of Regulation S-K; the cross-reference to Instruction I of Item 7(d) of Schedule 14A in Instruction 3(c) to Item 9 of Schedule 14A is changed to refer to Instruction 1 of Item 4(d) of Regulation S-K; the crossireference to Item 7 of Schedule 14A in Item 10(d) of Schedule 14A is changed to refer to Item 4 of Regulation S-K; the cross-references to Item,7(a) of Schedule 14A in Item 10 (c) and (d) of Schedule 14A are changed to refer to Item 4(a) of Regulation S-K; the cross-reference to Instruction 1 to Item 7(b) of Schedule 14A in Instruction 1 to Item 10 of Schedule 14A is changed to refer to Instruction 6 of Item 4(a) of Regulation S-K; the cross-references to Item 7(a) of Schedule 14A in Item 11 (b) and (c) of Schedule 14A are changed to refer to Item 4(a) of Regulation S-K: the cross-reference to Item 7 of Schedule 14A in Item 11(c) of Schedule 14A is changed to refer to Item 4 of Regulation S-K; the cross-reference to Instruction I to Item 7(b) of Schedule 14A in Instruction I to Item 11 of Schedule 14A is changed to refer to Instruction 6 to Item 4(a) of Regulation S-K; the cross-reference to Item 7(f) of Schedule 14A in Item 4(b) of Schedule 14B is changed to refer to Item 4(f) of Regulation S-K; the cross-references to Item 7(d) ,of Schedule 14A in Appendix A to Schedule 14A is changed to refer to Item 4(d) of Regulation S-K: the cross-reference to Instruction 4 to Item 7(d) of Schedule 14A in Appendix A to Schedule 14A is changed to refer to Instruction 5 to Item 4(d) of Regulation S-K. 4See Securities Act Release No. 6231 (September 2, 1980) (45 FR 63P30). 76976 Federal Register I Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations required by Item 11 of Regulation S-K, i.e. management discussion arid analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, when Item 7 [Exhibits] was recently added to Regulation S-K,5 a typographical error was made in paragraph (b)(10)(b)(3) which describes certain material contracts which must be filed as exhibits. As proposed, that paragraph was drafted to require the filing of \"[a]ny contract calling for the acquisition or sale of any property, plant or equipment for a consideration exceeding10% of all such assets of the -registrant and its subsidiaries.\" 6At the time of adoption, however, the'phrase\"of all such assets\" was mistakenly typed as \"of the assets,\" thereby inadvertently changing'the materiality test from a percentage of fixed assets to a percentage of all assets. Paragraph (b)(10)(b}(3) of Item 7 is, therefore, changed by these technical amendments to substitute the phrase -\"of such fixed assets\" for \"of the assets.\" 7 5See Securities Act Release No. 6230 (August 27, 1080) (45 FR 58822]. OSee Securities Act Release No. 8149 (November 16, 1979) (44 FR 67143]. 7See also paragraph 9(b)[3) of the Instructions as to Exhibits in Form S-18 which Is revised by these amendments to substitute the phrase \"of such fixed assets\" for \"of the assets\" to correct the same typographical error. Comparable changes are as follows: Rule 3-09(a) of Regulation S-X is changed to Include former Instruction 3(b) to Financial Statements required by Form 10-K which was inadvertently omitted when the instructions to financial statements were centralized in Regulation S-X (See Securities Act Release No. 6234 (September 2,1980) (45 FR 63682)); Paragraphs (b)(7) and (b)() of Rule 5-03 of Regulation S-X are changedto Include the phrase \"in the income statement or In a note thereto\" which was Inadvertently omitted when Regulation S-X was recently revised (See Securities Act Release No. 6233 (September 2, 1080) (45 FR 63660)1; Item 3(e)(1) of Regulation S-K is changed to Include a reference to \"executive officer\" In the first sentence which was Inadvertently omitted at the time Item 3 of Regulation S-K was adopted (See Securities Act Release No. 5949 (July 28.1978) (43 FR 34402]); Instruction 4 to Item 5 of Regulation S-K is changed. to include a reference to \"affiliate of the registrant\" which was inadvertently omitted at the time Item 5 of Regulation S-K was adopted (See Securities Act Release No. 5949 (July 28,1978) (43 FR 34402)); Column (2) requiring the name of the beneficial owner Is added to Item 6(b) of Regulation S-K to correct its inadvertent omission at the time Item 6 of Regulation S-K was adopted (See Securities Act Release No. 5949 (July 28,1978) (43 FR 34402)); Table I of Item 7 of Regulation S-K is revised to delete the \"x\" from the S-8,column with respect to tax opinion exhibits to correct a typographical error made at the tinle Item 7 of Regulation S-K was adopted (See Securities Act Release No. 6230 (August 27,1980] (45 FR 58822)); Table I of Item 7 of Regulation S-K is revised to delete the \"x\" from the S-2 column with respect to letters regarding unaudited financial information to correct a typographical error made at the time Item 7 of Regulation S-K was adopted (See Securities Act Release No. 8230 (August 27,1980) (45 FR 58822)); the reference to \"Section 410\" of the Internal Revenue Code in paragraph (b)(5)(b) of Item 7 of Regulation S-K is changed to \"Section 401\" to correct a typographical error made at theFinally, certain technical amendments are adopted in order to clarify the meaning of certain rules and forms under the Exchange Act. For example, Rule 14a-4 requires that the form of proxy indicate \"the identity of the persons on. whose behalf the solicitation is made\" if the solicitation is made other than by a majority of the board of directors. In order to nake clear that a group soliciting proxies in opposition to the board of directors need not identify every individual member of the group, the above phrase has been deleted. Similarly, the note to Rule 14a-6 ((Proxy) ,Material Required to be Filed) and Rule 14c-5 (Filing of Information Statement), stating that the printing of definitive copies for distribution should be deferred until staff comments are received and considered, is eliminated in view of confusion expressed as to whether the note modifies the provisions of Rule 14a-6 and 14c-5, which specify the time periods during which proxy material and information statements must be on file with the Commission.

With respect to the technical amendments to Regulation S-X, Regulation S-K, and the rules, forms and schedules under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. the Commission believes that it is appropriate to adopt these technical amendments effective immediately in order to clarify rule changes adopted by the Commission on August 27,1980 10 and September 2, 1980 1and to eliminate as soon as possible potential confusion resulting from inconsistencies, inadvertent omissions and typographical errors described above. Accordingly, the Commission. pursuant to Section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA') (5 U.S.C. 553(b)) for good cause finds that notice and opportunity for public comment are not required and that to provide for such notice and comment at this time is impracticable, unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. In addition, the Commission, pursuant to Section 553(d) of the APA (5 U.S.C. 553(d)) finds good cause to adopt the foregoing technical amendments effective immediately in order to clarify existing provisions of Regulations S-X and S-K and the rules, forms and schedules under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. With respect to the amendments to the CommissiZn's general organization rule delegating authority to the Director of the Division of Corporation Finance, the Commission finds that such amendments relate solely to agency management and personnel and. accordingly, are excepted pursuant to Section 553(a)(2) of the APA (5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1)) from the provisions of the APA which require prior notice and comment (5 U.S.C. 553(b)) and postponement of the effective date for at least 30 days after publication in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 553(d)). \"See Securities Act Release No. 630 (August 27, 1960) (45 FRX 58M22. \"See Securities Act Release No. 6231 (September 2. 1900) (45 FR 660) and Securities Act Release No. 6234 (September 2.900 (4- FR 3682].76961 76982 Federal Register / Vbl. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations By the Commission.

ACTION: Final rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Commission is amending Item 4 of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.20). In general, the amendments pertain to various aspects of remuneration disclosure including: Pension, option and stock appreciation 'right plans; the definition of an executive officer;, compensation relating to the termination of employment; and\" indebtedness of management. In addition, certain technical amendments are made and certain staff, interpretations are codified in the amendments. These amendments are intended to clarify disclosure requirements, to correct major distortions in the remuneration table and to provide meaningful information to investors with respect to management remuneration. EFFECTIVE DATE: For documents filed after January 1,1981. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Prior to the effective date contact Joseph G. Connolly, Jr., (202) 272-3097, Chief, Office of.Tender Offers; or Bruce S. Mendelsohn (202) 272-2091, Office of Disclosure Policy; thereafter contact Ann Glickman, Office of Chief Counsel, (202) 272-2573, Division of Corporation Finance, Securities and Exchange Commission, 500 North Capitol Street, Washington, D.C. 20549. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission today adopted amendments to Item 4 of Regulation S-K pursuant to Sections 6, 7, 8, and 19 of the Securities Act of 1933 (15-U.S.C. 77a et seq.) (the \"Securities Act\") and Section 12, 13, 14, 15(d) and 23(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. -8a et seq.) (the \"Exchange Act\"). These amendments involve the disclosure of management remuneration and specifically address pension, option and stock appreciation right (including phantom stock) plans, the definition ofan executive officer, compensation relating to the termination of employment, indebtedness of management, transactions with management, and certain other technical amendments. On May 6,1980, the Commission published Release No. 33-6210 (May 6, 1980) [45 FR 31733j which proposed for comment revisions to Item 4 of Regulation S-K (the \"May 1980 proposals\"). While the adopted amendments adhere to the concepts represented by the proposals, certain revisions were made in response to further study and to the comment letters received. The Commission believes that information about management remuneration is imp'ortant to both stockholders and investors, because it is necessary and appropriate in evaluating the goals and policies of the company, the governance of the company, the cost of management, and the integrity of management. Accordingly, the Commission has devoted significant efforts in recent years to expand and improve disclosure in this area. However, the Commission is also aware l'at its rules on disclosure of management remuneration are detailed, that the posts of generating the necessary data are substantial, and that compliance would be aided by minimizing unnecessary changes in the rules. The Commission believes that these amendments correct significant distortions arising under prior rules,. and therefore is not inclined to make further modifications to the basic rules, except in certain limited areas or unless further problems arise. The public is requested to continue to communicate with the Commission staff on any difficulties or further suggestions relating to remuneration disclosure, and the staff will continue to be available to provide interpretive guidance, The following portions of this release contain a background discussion and a synopsis of the amendments which includes a discussion of certain issues raised by the commentators. However, attention is directed to the text of the amendments for a more complete understanding. 1. Background In Release No.,33-6003 (December 4, 1978) (43 FR 58151), the Commission adopted amendments to Item 4 of Regulation S-K, substantially revising the disclosure requirements relating to management remuneration (the \"1978 amendments\"). The revised Item 4 required tabular and other forms of 'disclosure as to all remuneration from the registrant and its subsidiaries forservices during the latest fiscal year by certain specified persons and officers and directors as a group.1 The 1978 amendments resulted in part from the Commission's recognition that remuneration packages had become more diverse and complex and, as a result, disclosure had become less uniform.2 Many forms of remuneration were not being included in the then required table3 but instead were being disclosed through narrative discussions set forth in text, footnotes or paragraphs which, in many cases, obscured the total remuneration received, Therefore, It was the Commission's intention that the Item 4(a) remuneration table reflect all remuneration which can be quantified and related to services performed by specified members of management during the fiscal year. The May 1980 proposals were the result of continuous mqnitorlng and interpretation of the remuneration requirements after the 1978 amendment. Wile the Commission found that the remuneration table generally worked well,4 it also recognized that certain modifications were necessary. In this regard, it became apparent that there are forms of remuneration that are difficult to quantify and relate to a particular year's services. The May 1080 proposals and the amendments adopted today reflect the Commission's belief IItem 4(a) of Regulation S-K requires tabular disclosure (the \"remuneration table\") of total remuneration for each of the five most highly compensated executive officers and directors and for all officers and directors as a group. The remuneration table consistL of four main columns, Columns A and B call for the name of the Individual or the number of persons in the group and the capacities In which such persons served during the year. Column C repoits cash and cash-equivalent forms of remuneration (\"current remuneration\") and Is separated info 2 subcolumns. Instruction 2 to Item 4(a) provides for the inclusion In Column C1 of all salaries and fees paid with respect to services rendered during the registrants's last fiscal year and the inclusion in Column C2 of other cash or cash. equivalent amounts. Column D includes remuneration for which amounts are expensed for financial reporting purposes and the measurement of benefits or the distribution or unconditional vesting thereof is subject to future events (\"contingent remuneration\"). 2See Release No. proposed the 1078 Item 4 amendments for comment. 3Required by former Item 7(a) of Schedule 14A. 4The Commission Is of the view that management should be permitted a measure of flexibility In determining the placement of remuneration' disclosure in its proxy or Information statements and, accordingly, has not adopted specific requirements in this area. In this regard, the' Commission notes that since the adoption of thq 1978 amendments to Item 4, registrants have generally presented all remuneration disclosure together in their materials. The revisions adopted today envision that this practice will continue and that all tables relating to the various components of remuneration will remain concentrated in one section of the proxy or information statement. Fedeel Degister / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21. 1980 / Rules and Regulations 78M that remuneration resulting from stock option, pension and stock appreciation right plans is better suited to uniform disclosure outside the parameters of the Item 4(a) table. As will be discussed below, since Column D entries are keyed to amounts expensed for financial reporting purposes, most of the Commission's concerns result from distortions caused by accounting treatment of certain ecomomic benefits.' The Commission's efforts to review, modify, and simplify the reporting requirements received support from almost all of the more than 90 commentators.s Most commentators believed that the proposals were a positive step forward in creating more comprehensible disclosure in this area and complimented the Commission for undertaking to reView its rules. In light of the generally favorable response by the commentators and the resolution of the distortions, the Commission has determined to adopt these amendments for the 1981 proxy season. H. Synopsis of Aueudwt A. Clcrification of Remuneration Included in Column C Allocation of amounts to the proper tabular colun has created some confusion among registrants and their advisors during the pest two years. In particular, Instructions 3(a), 3(b) and 3(c) to Item 4(a), which list forms of compensation that may require reporting in Column D. have been the subject of many interpretive questions. For example, the Commission found that some registrants have had the misconception that amounts attributable to the remuneration plans specified in these instructions should always be reported in Column D, rather than Column C. However, Column D is to be used for remuneration amounts that have been expensed for financial reporting purposes but as to which the sit should be emphasized that only certain market-based plans such as options (which ordinarily ae never ralected in compenaaion expense), and slae, apprecation right and certai phantom stock plans (where changes in the market value of securities immediately affect compensation expense) are reported searaly under thee amedmns 'The ommenoiator may be categorized as follows: management and compensation consulting firms [#}) accounting asaociations (1), law firms and bar assocasion ftji ban. beak hokling companies and banking associons (4-, industry or trade associations [5); corporations (71) and individals (1). Copies of the comment letters are available for pub6ic inespectio asod copying at the Cmmissm's Public Re ce Room (ie No. S7-as), For the convenience of the public. a copy of the mummary of comments prepared by the staff of the Commission has been placed in File No. S7-835 and is also available for public inspection and copying Indeed, this was an important subject of Release No. 33-6106.measurement of benefits or the distribution or unconditional vesting thereof is subject to future events. Therefore, If an amount under a specified plan is not subject to a future contingency, a Column C entry may be proper. In order to clarify the proper allocation of amounts between Column C and D, the Commission proposed in Release No. 33-O210 to add a parenthetical note in Instruction 2 to Item 4(a) which would have stated that the specific forms of remuneration referred to in Instruction 3 to Item 4(a) are properiy reported in Column C if the distribution of such remuneration or the unconditional vesting or measurement of benefits thereunder is not subject to future events. The commentators who addressed the issue generally endorsed the proposal and recognized it as merely a codification of a staff interpretation contained in Release No. 33-8166 Iand as consistent with past staff administrative practice. In response to comments:the Commission has decided that a new Instruction 2(e) to Item 4(a) would be preferable to the proposed parenthetical note: the language of the note has been included substantially as proposed, but with additional clanfication. Instruction 2(el requires, consit.tently with the Commission's past interpretations, the inclusion in Column C of remuneration attributable to plans of the type described in Instruction 3 to Item 4(a) if at the end of the fiscal year such remuneration was distributed to or for the account of the specified indi iduals or group. or was accrued and the measurement and the distribution or unconditional vesting thereof were not subject to future events. The instruction has also been expanded to indicate that, if remuneration as conditioned on substantial future service, or if the amount or value of cr entitlement to remuneration is dependent on future earnings performance or market vAues. the remuneration is \"subject to future events\" under this standard. Where part of an award is subject to future events, that part would properly be included in Column D, while the portion not sublet to future events would be included in Column C. Furthermore, several commentators noted that the language in the proposed Iln Iepreue Response I7 of ReLse No 3.- 8166. the Divmon Corporabon ,ith to deferred plans [d pe of plan enumerated under In$txuc'in respect to Colamn D fvr w,.iLh amounts are expensed, Column D ss r\". be used wll. if the distributuon ofremuneratan under t e prin v,- the unconditional i estmg or mcre'rieen! ul benefits under the plan is subtect to future 'ents %hich represent a true contlngerc%parenthetical note was inconsistent with existing Instruction 2 to Item 4(a) (relating to Column C disclosures). It was pointed out that the proposed clarification and Instruction 3 to Item 4(a) (relating to Column D disclosures) provides that remuneration should be reported in Column C whenever not subject to future events, although current Instruction 2 to Item 4(a) includes in Column C amounts which with \"reasonable certainty\" will be distributed or unconditionally vested in the future. The commentators requested thathe language of the instructions be made consistent so as to clarify the appropriate test for Column C amounts. To resolve the inconsistency, the Commission has revised Instruction 2 to Item 4(a) to delete the reference to\"reasonable certainty\" and substitute the term \"not subject to future events,\" and has made other minor changes to conform Instructions 2 2(e) and 3 to Item 4(a). The Commission belie- es that the objective test based on \"future events\" is more meaningful and preferable under the circumstances. These technical language changes do not, however, affect the meaning of the standard nor alter present or past staff interpretations. B. Instruction ib) to Item 4[a)- Definition of Executive Officer In Release No. 33--6210, the Commission proposed to amend the definition of the term \"executive officer\" appearing in Instruction i(b) to Item 4(a)9by adding the following sentence: \"K\\ecuitive officers\" subsilaries may be deemed the registrant if they perform polic! -making functions for the regisL-ant The Commission stated that th:s proposal reflected the initilal intention of the instruction. Indeed, in Release No. 33-6003, the Commission advised registrants that they should give careful consideration to the question of who are the appropriate individuals to be included in the table, and to whether certain highly compensated directors or employees of subsidiaries are in fact\"executive officers\" of the registrant. Additionally, the Commission stated that it would monitor the disclosure practices in this area to determine whether further actions were appropriate. The Commission's proposal in this area was the result of the perceived continuance of 'Pror to trit or fUr -toi (such as iales administration or financel, an l iny other persi' who performs similar pojicy-frAi_,g fneicn.' 76984- Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 [Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations misconceptions as to the intent of the defimtion and was designed to provide clarity to registrants. Certain commentators believed that without modifications the proposal would expand the definition of executive officer unnecessarily. Pursuant to these comments the language of the proposal was reconsidered, since.the intent of the' proposals was to provide clarification rather than to expand the category of individuals for whom disclosure would be necessary under Item 4(a)(1). In light of the concerns expressed by the - commentators, the Commission has revised the proposal by inserting the word \"such\" to modify the term \"policy- making functions for the registrant,\" to indicate that the executive officer of a subsidiary must perform the same types of functions as other persons- constituting executive officers of the registrant. In this regard, the Commission is providing additional guidance in response to certain comments by codifying the Division of Corporation Finance's published interpretation regarding the determination of the individuals to be named in the remuneration table.10 New Instruction 1(c) to Item 4(a) states, in pertinent part, that \"[riegistrants should * exercise a measure of flexibility in determining which individuals should be named in the remuneration table in order to avoid anomalous results and to assure that disclosure documents contain information on key policy- making members of management.\" The Commission recognizes that under certain circumstanqes an individual who is nominally one of the five most highly compensated executive officers or directors may not be one of the key policy makers. Compensation may be inflated in a given year because of a non-recurring event, such as a large bonus or commission, and to include, such an executive in the persons named in the table would be inappropriate.' If a registrant determines not to name an 1In Release No. 33-6027, the Division of Corporation Finance issued its interpretive views regarding certain aspects of the management remuneration disclosure requirements of Item 4, Including the Division's view on the'determination of which members of management comprise the five most highly compensated executive officers and directors to be named in the table. \"1New Instruction 1(c) to Item 4(a) sets forth certain standards to be applied in making the necessary determination to exclude an executive's name in the remuneration table. However, the instruction further states that \"a registrant should not apply the above standards mechanically; consideration should be given to the question of whether a person's level of remuneration would give rise to a conclusion that the person may be among the five most highly compensated, key polcy-making executive officers or directors.\"executive officer in the table pursuant to the new instruction, that individual's compensation would still be included under the disclosure for the group of all officers and directors. C. Item 4(b)-Proposed Remuneration 12 Item 4b) currently requires a brief description of all remuneration payments proposed to be made in the future pursuant to any plan or arrangement to the person and the group specified in the remuneration table.1 . Because of numerous public inquiries,. the Commission proposed, and has adopted substantially as proposed, a new Instruction 1 to Item 4(b) to make clear that disclosure is necessary for any remunerative plan or arrangement which is operable for more than the latest fiscal year, whether or not , -amounts attributable to such plan or arrangement are included in the tabular or textual disclosures of remuneration pursuant to Items 4(a), 4(c) or 4(d). Although one commentator believed that inclusion'of amounts in the remuneration table would provide stockholders with sufficient information, the Commission believes that the instruction is necessary to assure that stockholders are provided with a full appreciation of remuneration to be paid in the future. The operation of the new instruction may be illustrated by.the situation where amounts attributable to an ohgoing bonus plan have been disclosed in Column C1 of the table. Because the bonus plan will be operable in future years, a description of the plan is necessary and, in this case, should include, among other things, brief disclosure with regard to the payment formulas and general payment schedules. Because the disclosure of remunerative plans which will continue to operate in subsequent fiscal years has not been as complete as necessary, and in response to certain commentators, the Commission has included in Item 4(b)(1) explicit requirements as to the composition of the necessary disclosure. The Commission is concerned that many companies have responded to the Item 4(b) requirement by describing the operation' of a formal, highly-structured plan 14in terms so general that as a 2The disclosure required by this provision is parallel to that which had been required for some time by former Item 7 of Schedule 14A (17 CFR 240.14a-101). S Item 4(b) has also been separated into two sub- items and reworded. Item 4(b](1) relates to proposed remuneration In general and Item 4(b)(2) addresses pension disclosure and Is discussed below. \"1It should be noted that Instruction 6 to Item 4(a) describes the term \"plan\" as used in Item 4 asresult there is little understanding by stockholders of the level of performance and the period of time needed to generate payments under the plan, Furthermore, there has been a failure to make clear whether the compensation measurements relate to short-term or long-term objectives or performance. The Item 4(b)(1) description should include a summary of how each plan' operates, any performance formula or measure in effect, the time periods over which the measurement of benefits will be determined, payment schedules, and any recent material amendments to the plan. For the mostpart, this represents a codification of the position taken by the staff in Interpretive Response 40 in Release No. 33-6160, and will make the 'disclosure more meaningful to stockholders. Disclosure as to operations of future incentive plans is essential to a shareholder's comprehension of remuneration policies. The goals explicitly or implicitly set by such plans may affect, and indeed are often specifically designed to affect, management's conductof company affairs. The Commission expects more complete disclosure of future incentive programs as a result of the clarification of Item 4(b), and encourages companies to provide explanations of the relationship of incentive compensation programs to short-term and long-term corporate objectives. D. Pension Plan Disclosure As noted in the May 1980 release, many questions have arisen with regard to the disclosure of amounts relating to defined benefit and actuarial plans. In Release No. 33-6166, the staff discussed this area in detail and offered an alternate format of disclosure by way of interpretation. The purpose of the May 1980 proposals, which have been adopted substantially as proposed, was to codify the staff's suggested alternative as a mandatory requirement. The treatment of pension and retirement plans under the 1978 amendments, set forth in Instruction 3(a)(i) to Item 4(a), required that the amount expensed for financial reporting purposes by a registrant or Its subsidiaries for the year representing the contribution, payment or accrual for the account of the specified individuals or group be included in Column D If the distribution of such remuneration or the unconditional vesting or measurement of benefits thereunder was subject to including \"all plans, contract, authorizations, or arrangements, whether or not set forth In any formal documents.\" Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday. November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations future events.Is Hosever, with respect to the overwhelming majority of defined benefit or astunial plans, the same Instruction 34a)(. provided that if the\"amount of the aentribution, payment or accrual witwk} respect (to) a specified person is not and cannot readily be separately or individually calculated by the regular actuaries of the plan,\" then such amounts could be omitted from the remuneration table provided a footnote was included. 1The feotnote required disclosure of the excluded amounts, indicating the percestage which the aggregate contributions to the plan bore to the total covered remuneration of the plan participants, and a brief description of the remuneration covered by the plan. In ftr= Item 4(b) required that, with respect to amounts so excluded under Instructions 3(a)(i) and (ii). a separate table be included to show estimated annual benefits payable upon retirement to persons in sptcified remuneration and year-of-service classifications. Because of the apparent difficulty in calculating the amount of contribution attributable to each participant under most subject plans, the fiotnote discloste required by former Instruction 3(a)(ii) and the Item 4(b) pension table has been extensively utilized. When this has not been the case, the Commission has reason to believe that there has been an inconsistency regarding the inclusion of amounts relating to these plans in the remuneration table. In any event, the Commission perceiver little reason to continue requiring different disclosure for the same form of emuneration. Accordingly, the adopted amendments, like the proposals, deal with all defined benefit and actuarial pension plans. The amendments adopted today will exclude all amounts relating to defined benefit or actuarial plans from the remuneration table by amending Instruction 3(a)(i) and deleting the footnote requirement of Instruction 3(a)(ii]. New Item 4(b)(2J, which contains the disclosure requirements concerning such plans, has been adopted substantially as proposed. The overwhelming majority of the commentators indicated approval of the Commission's attempt to improve the nature of the disclosure in this area and considered the proposal to be an improvement over the existing format. \"Under unusual circumstances. a plan may involve amngements to whieh this condition would not appby and. instead, them wmuld in a specilic fiscal ye rbe aemued or distributed for the account of the participant a cash or cesh-equivaleat amount. In this situatiot. reporning would occur in Column C with rempect to the con tribuso for that year. See Release No. 33-a0m. \"Crent Ination s(aXii) to Item 4(.As a result of certain views expressed by the commentators and to assist stockholders in understanding the type of pension plan maintained by the registrant, certain revisions have been incorporated nto the pension disclosure requirements as adopted. As revised. Item 4{b)(2) will require a pension table 1t showing estimated annual benefits payable upon retirement to individuals is specified remuneration and years of service classifications. In response to a number of questions that have arisen with regard to the disclosure of amounts in response to Item 4(b)(2) as proposed and to provide for uniform disclosure, this item has been revised to require that- (1) The estimated annual benefits disclosed in the pension table include any amounts attributable to any supplementary or excess pension award .plans; (2) the registrant describe the remuneration covered by the plan, and indicate its relationship to remuneration reported in Column C1 of the Item 4(a) remuneration table; (3) the registrant indicate whether the benefits listed in the pension table are subject to any deduction for Social Security benefits or other offs t amounts; and (4) the amount presented in the pension table be on a straight life annuity basis notwithstanding the availability of joint survivorship provisions. The proposed definition of \"normal retirement\" was not adopted because of the commentators' concerns that the term is unclear. Mandatory retirement ages, if any. vary, and the proposed disclosure for years of service at normal retirement of the individuals named in the Item(a) table would provide little meaningful information. As adopted. Item 4{b)(2) will require that registrants state the credited years of service under the plan for each of the Item 4(a) individuals so that shareholders will be able to relate the pension benefits described with the executive officers identified in the remuneration table. The May 1960 Release contained a proposed Note following the pension table which would have provided that the table reflect reasonable increases in existing compensation levels. Most commentators considered this information to be speculative and potentially confusing to stockholders. The Note has been redrafted as Instruction 2 to Item 4(b)(2) and. at the suggestion of one commentator. registrants will be permitted to use an upper limit for the disclosure of increases in the existing compensation levels. Specifically, to provide \"Item 4(b) currently requires a pension table only whoa amounts are excludd from the remuneration table.registrants some certainty as to the amounts which should be reflected in the table. Instruction 2 to Item 4(b) provides that registrants may present, as the highest remuneration level reported, an amount equal to 120 percent of the highest amount of covered compensation which is reported in the table required by Item 4(a). An alternative format is allowed by Instruction 3 to Item 4(b) where pension or actuarial plans are not based upon the final year's (or years') remuneration. For such plans, a registrant must provide a description of the plan (including benefit formula) and indicate the estimated annual benefits upon normal retirement 14 for individuals named in the Item 4(a) remuneration table. However, this alternative is available only for plans not suitable for disclosure in the regular pension table. All final year (or final average years) type plans must continue to be disclosed in the required pension table format. E. Options andStock Appreciation Rights In the May 1980 Release, the Commission proposed certain revisions to the instructions to Item 4(a) of Regulation S-K which were designed to remove option and stock appreciation right (\"SAR\") plans, including certain phantom stock plans, from the remuneration table. Under the proposals, all disclosures of remuneration under such plans, previously included in the remuneration table, would be set forth in an expanded option table pursuant to Item 4(d) of the Regulation. With few exceptions, the response of the commentators was overwhelmingly supportive of the thrust of the proposals to remove from the Item 4(a) remuneration table disclosure respecting stock option and SAR plans. Commentators who supported the proposal uniformly agreed with the Commission's position that such remuneration disclosure may bear little or no relationship to the services rendered to the registrant during the fiscal year and, consequently, may tend to distort the remuneration table and confuse the shareholder. Many of these commentators, however, advanced criticisms and suggestions with regard to the proposals, and the adopted rules are responsive to many of these concerns. \"For plan not reported in the regaulrpessimo table, normal retiremeant age is defined (in accordance with a commutator's uggesti ) pwr Ided in the plan. or f the pla bas no definition. the earhut ae at wkh the individual may reie without omefi t redctiom an account of age.76M 76986 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations 1. Option Disclosure. Under the 1978 amendments-Instruction 2(b) to Item 4(a) specified with regard to any stock option that the spread, if any, between the acquisition price and the fair market price of the underlying security on the, date of exercise be reported in Column C2 (less any amount that may have been previously reported with respectto such option).19 This method of option disclosure may not be meaningful and may tend to distort the compensation reported in Column C2 of the remuneration table for a particular officer or director, especially for the reporting period during which an option is exercised. While option plans may represent a significant element in many compensation packages, the calculation of remuneration thereunder may not be easily attributable to a given year of service. As stated in Release No. 33- 6210, there have been instances where an officer, because of market conditions or other factors, has dxercised during the latest fiscal year, options received overa numbe? of years which resulted in the inclusion in Column C2 of the entire spread between the exercise price and the fair market value of the securities received in the year of such exercise. Because of the disclosure problems presented by option plans, the Commission proposedto exclude the\"spread\" resulting from the exercise of stock options from disclosure in the remuneration table, and today the Commission adopted the basic concepts and methodology of the proposal. Instruction 2(b) to Item 4(a) has been amended to exclude the fair market value of the securities (less the exercise price) received pursuant to the exercise of stock options. All option information (other than the Item 4(b)(1) description of the plan) will be disclosed pursuant to modfied Item 4(d) requirements.20 The May 1980 Release also proposed the deletion of the de minimis exception in Instruction 3 to Item 4(d). Of the twelve commentators who responded to the Commission's specific inquiry in this area, only one supported the proposed deletion. However, after further study the Commission still believes that the de minimis exclusion is inappropriate in light of the fact that the spread relating to the exercise of options will no longer \"9This is one of the few instances where Item 4 does not follow generally accepted accounting principles. In most cases, there is no adcounting expense for the grant or exercise of a stock option. \"Instruction 5 to Item 4(d), which remains unchanged, states In pertinent part that the information called for by the Item 4(d) may be furnished in the form of the table set forth in Appendix A to Schedule 14A. Appendix A has been revised to reflect today's amendments to Item 4(d).be in the remuneration table.21 In addition, the Commission believes that no significant burden is placed on registrarits because of the deletion since information on employee options and market prices of securities is readily available to the registrant. While the proposals would have followed the current rules in requiring option disclosure to be presented for the 'period since the beginning of the registrant's last fiscal year,2 a specific inquiry was made in the May. 1980 release on the time period issue. The commentators were overwhelmingly in favor of a fiscal year reporting requirement. The most frequently stated reason for deleting the reporting of option transactions occurring after the close of the last fiscal year was that this deletion would eliminate the duplicative reporting of such transactions in two consecutive yeard. Another often expressed view was that the reporting period for option transactions should be consistent with the fiscal year reporting period for the remuneration table. In light of these commentsthe Commission has determined that the fiscal year period is appropriate in most cases,23 will better facilitate year-to-year comparisons and will create more understandable disclosure. Moreover, a fiscal year period will allow for the reporting of SARs in tandem with options along with the options to which they relate.24 A related new Instruction 7 to Item 4(d) was added to require disclosure of the granting of options or SARs since the end of the last fiscal year if the total market value of the underlying securities 21The correlative new provisions in Item 4(d) relating to SARs not in tandem with options, which are described below, also have no de minimis exception. 22In addition, proposed Instruction 3 to Item 4(d) would have allowed option information to be reported separately for (1) option transactions during the past fiscal year. and (2) option transactions since the close of the fiscal year tothc' latest practicable date. Since a fiscal year period has been adopted, this proposal was not necessary and was not adopted. 22However with regard to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933 by a company not subject to Exchange Act reporting requirements, new Instruction 5 to Item 4(d) requires information regarding options and SARs for the period since the beginning of the last fiscal year through a date not more than 30 days prior tothe date of filing the'registration statement. Further. with regard td any company, Instruction S to Item 4(d) has been retained and requires that information with regard to unexercised options [and SARs in trandem therewith) be presented as of a date not more than 30 days prior to the date of filing of the registration statement. It should be noted that these requirements relate only to situations where Item 4(d),information must be presented in a prospectus. rather than incorporated by reference therein. 24See discussion regarding SARs in tandem with options. infro.on the granting dates exceeds $50,000. Since the new options and SAR reporting provisions will already require disclosure of potential (unrealized) value at the end of the year, there appears no reason to require further information for the interim period as to exercise or realization of options or rights by which an individual obtains a portion of that potential value. Exercise or realization, and changes in potential value, will be reflected in the following year's remuneration disclosure. New grants are the only changes over which the company has control, and, accordingly, interim disclosure will be required only as to significant new grants. The Commission believes that this requirement is appropriate in light of the new fiscal year reporting period, is consistent with the more complete disclosure of future remuneration plans under Item 4(b), and will allow stockholders to appreciate more fully the operation of such 1lans, 2 Proposed Item 4(d)(3) would have mandated option disclosure 21 for \"all other employees\" of the registrant in addition to the disclosure required for only officers and directors. The response of the commentators who specifically addressed this proposal was overwhelmingly negative. Most commentators believed that information concerning all other einployees would' not be material in most cases. The Commission has reconsidered its position and has decided not to require option or SAR information as to \"all other employees\" except where currently required. 27 Registrants are urged, however, to consider such -disclosure where it wouild facilitate integration of Exchange Act and Securities Act disclosure such as in the Form S-8 (17 CFR 239.16b) which permits the incorporation by reference of option information appearing in an issuer's proxy statement.2 Under former Item 4(d), the average option price was required to be disclosed both for options exercised and options outstanding at the end of the period, but there was no actual 2The requirement In Instruction 7 does not apply if information called for by Item 4(d) is Incorporated by reference, rather than presented, in a registration statement filed pursuant to ho Securities Act. 2Likewise. proposed Item 4(d)(vl) would have required SAR information for all other employees, \"See Items 9(d)(ll), 10(d)(lll) and 11(c)(li) of Schedule 14A.28As stated in Instruction 4 to Item 3 of Form S-8, (\"Purchase of Securities Pursuant to PlAn\"), the information regarding options required under Item 3 of Form S-8 Is more extensive than presently called for by Item 4(d) of Regulation S-IC Of coutse, registrants may include the balance of the Item 3 information in their proxy statements and incorporate by reference such data into a Form S-0. Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 190 / Rules and Regulations disclosure in the remuneration table of amounts realized on exercise of options or of the potential value of unexercised options. The May 1980 proposals sought disclosure of amounts realized and unrealized gain as to SARs. The amendments on disclosure of potential value apply to options as well as SARa. New Item 4(d](il) not only requires disclosure of amounts realized from SARs held in tandem with options, but also requires disclosure of the value realized upon exercise of an option. generally the \"spread\" between the market price of securities received less any option price. Similarly, Item 4(d)(iii) will require disclosure of the potential (unrealized) value of all options and tandem SARs outstanding at the end of the period. (Item 4(d){iv) requires similar disclosure for SARs not in tandem with options.) Most commentators voiced some degree of disapproval of the concept of unrealized gain in the context of proposed stock appreciation rights table. The Commission believes, however, that the disclosure of potential (unrealized) value of outstanding options and SARs, as well as value realized upon exercise, is necessary and appropriate to a more complete understanding of the operation of such remuneration packages.\"e By moving the options and SAR disclosure out of the remuneration table, the Commission recognizes that amounts realized in connection with such remuneration are not precisely allocable to specific periods. Nevertheless, there should be some disclosure of the events which actually result in value being received by the officer or director- exercise or realization-and of the total of the individual's potential benefits. Disclosure of an average option exercise price or the SAR base price, while helpful, does not directly indicate either value realized or potential value-it is also necessary to compare the option or base price to the current market price. The Commission believes it is appropriate for registrants to make this comparison and disclose values, rather \"It should be noted that the proposed Instruction 7 to Item 4(d) has been adopted as Instruction 8. Instruction 8 states that in calculating potential [unrealized) value of outstanding options and SARa, issuers should report the realizable value as though it had been realized at the valuation date. All outstanding rights or options with exercise prices above the market price as of the valuation date should be disregarded in determining this calculation. Therefore, potential value for options, SARs and similar rights will not be a net figure. but rather would be calculated only as to those options or rights with respect to which option or base prices were below the current market price. In this manner, the amounts realizable if exercise occurred on the reporting date will be disclosed.than priqes.*' Moreover, by using these value concepts, the disclosure of options and SARs will be consistent and. therefore, information concerning SARs and options can easily be integrated in the table relating to options and tandem SARs (or even in a single table relating to all options and SARa if the registrant so chooses). More generally, since option and SAR information will no longer be in the remuneration table, the Commission believes that the Item 4(d) data should be as complete and understandable as possible. Other than the disclosure of value received upon exercise and potential (unrealized) value of outstanding options at the end of the period, Item 4(d) will require data similar to that of the former item. Item 4(d)(i) 31 requires information as to options granted during the period including (1) the title and aggregate amount of securities subject to options; (2) the average option price per share; and (3) if the option price was less than 100 percent of the market value of the security on the date of grant, such fact and the market price on such date. Item 4(d)(ii) requires as to options exercised during the period disclosure of the value of securities received less any exercise price paid. Item 4(d){iii) requires as to unexercised options information concerning (1) the amount of underlying securities involved and (2) the aggregate potential (unrealized) value (market value of such securities less the aggregate exercise price). 2. Stock Appreciation Rights and Phantom Stock Not in Tandem with Options. At the time of the May 1980 proposals, the Commission was concerned that the inclusion in the remuneration table of amounts expensed for financial reporting purposes for SARs and interests in 30Of course. values realized may be subject to conditions. For example, an officer purchasing stock on exercise of an option may be obligated to hold for at least six months because of Section 18(b) of the Exchange Act (15 US C. 7S.fb)} and the market price may change before a sale is possible Likewise. potential (unrealized) value may include amounts which are not currently available for an officer or director because the option or right is not yet vested or exercisable. and potential value may change after the valuation date if the market price fluctuates. A registrant is free to make appropriate disclosure of additional facts, such as vesting provisions. performance or other contingencies and market and exercise prices, which may bear on the value or potential value of remuneration- New Instruction 10 to Item 4(d) specifically allows registrant& If they choose, to set forth separately the potential value attributable to exercisable options or SARa and the potential value attributable to rights which are not currently exercisable- 31 Items 4(dXi). 4(dXu} and 4fdXtiJ also relate to stock appreciation rights granted in tandem with options. The subject of tandem SARs will be discussed below.phantom stock plans may have tended to confuse shareholders as to the nature of the registrant's compensation arrangements for the fiscal year. It had become apparent that this was particuarly true for unexercised rights under such market-based award plans, since these rights are subject to the unpredictable fluctuations of the market-place. Where value changes are taken into account in determining financial reporting expense for the year In which the market value changes occur, the amount reported in the remuneration table (the amount expensed) may have no relation to services rendered during the fiscal year. Under the 1978 amendments, Instruction 3fb](i] to Item 4(a) required that Column D of the remuneration table reflect the annual market change that is expensed for financial reporting purposes with regard to SARs and certain phantom stock plans.31 In addition, former Instruction 3(b)(i) to Item 4(a) permitted a credit to be taken against any amounts previously reported in Column D, if in a subsequent fiscal year the registrant, in connection with the same plan or arrangement, credited its remuneration expense for financial reporting purposes. As a result of these provisions, the reporting of SARs may have consisted of positive entries in one year followed by a series of negative entries in subsequent years depending on the movement of the market price of the underlying security. In the May 1980 Release, the Commission stated that because of the above mentioned concerns, as well as the fact that SARs and similar phantom stock plans contribute a significant percentage of the negative amounts reflected in Column D, prior Item 4(d) requirements may not have been serving the purpose of the remuneration table, which is to reflect remuneration attributable to services rendered in the latest year. In response to these considerations, the Commission proposed certain revisions to Instructions 2(b) and 3(b) to Item 4(aI and to Item 4(d) of Regulation S-Y. Generally, the May 1980 proposals were designed to exclude amounts relating to SARs and interests in certain phantom stock plans from the remuneration table, while requiring certain disclosure concerning such plans pursuant to an expanded Item 4(d) requirement. In this regard, Item 4(d) was proposed to be amended by adding two new subparts which would have required separate disclosure with 3For a further discussion of this subject, see nerpret e Responses 8 through ii in Release No. 33-6156.I r76987 76988 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Priday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations respect to SARs and interests in phantom stock plans. With regard to all such plans, proposed Item 4(d)(iv) would have called for the following information: (1) The number of SARs granted during the last fiscal year; (2) the number of SARs exercised during the last fiscal year;, and (3) the number of SARs outstanding as of the end of the fiscal y~ar. Likewise, proposed Item 4(d](ir) would have required disclosure of: (1) The unrealized gain relating to all SARs held under these plans as of the beginning'of the last fiscal year; (2) the unrealized gain with respect to SARs granted during the year;, (3) the value of cash or securities received upon exercise during the last fiscal year;, and (4) the unrealized gain relating to all SARs held at the end of the last fiscal year. A proposed amendment to Instruction 1 to Item 4(d) would have defined the term \"stock appreciation right\" as including interests in phantom stock plans. However, this proposed Instruction did not otherwise define SAR or phantom stock plans. Appendix A of Schedule 14A was proposed to be expanded to accommodate the above information in a table separate from the option disclosure. As with options, use of the Appendix A format was not to be mandatory. The Commission continues to believe that the proposed removallfrom the remuneration table of disclosure relating to SARs (including phantom stock), when coupled with stock options, is appropriate and that the new table will provide meaningful information to stockholders in a more easily understandable manner. For this reason, the Commission has determined to adopt the May 1980 proposals with certain modifications in response to further review and to the commentators. The following first discusses the disclosure of SARs not in tandem with options, and then discusses tandem SARs.' With few exceptions, the response of the commentators was overwhelmingly in support of the proposals to remove disclosure regarding SARs and certain phantom stock plans from the remuneration table. The commentators believed that major changes in annual remuneration created by price swings in the market have prodticed tabular data which is not meaningful. While. supporting the concept of the proposals, some commentators criticized its methodology and suggested changes. A common suggestion was that the Commission shoild define the term\"phantom stock\" as used in proposed Instruction 1 to Item 4(d). Since the primary reason for removing SARs fromthe remuneration table was to address the 4istortive effects of reporting market fluctuations in Column D. the Commission has decided to adopt a definition of SARs which includes interests in phantom stock plans and which is applicable only to Item 4 of Regulation S-K. This definition is consistent with the salient characteristics of SARs. Specifically, new Instruction 1 to Item 4(d) defines a. SAR (including an interest in a phantom stock plan) as a compensation right or unit under whlch the measurement of benefits to be received is a function of the market price of the underlying security, and a change in such market value is taken into account in determining expenses for financial reporting purposes for the year in. which the market value change occurs.3 The definition of SARs does not cover all compensation programs which may be called \"stock appreciation\" or\"market based\" plans, under which compensation is based on market value or market appreciation; nor does the definition cover performance-based plans where the measurement of compensation is unrelated tb market prices of securities. For example, if a share unit (or restricted share) is expensed solely on the basis of the value of the share at the time of grant with no subsequent charge or credit to earnings reflecting market value- changes, the unit (or restricted share) would not be a SAR under the above definition.34 Also, certain commentators suggested thatall contingent or future value incentive plans should be treated similarly whether market-based or performance-based. While sympathetic to such views, the Commission has not been able to develop an appropriate format which is brief and easily comprehensible and which comports with the current framework of remuneration disclosure. Therefore, performance compensation, the measurement of which is based on earnings, increases in book value or similar standards, will also continue to 3Registrants are directed to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and appropriate interpretations thereunder. .4The aggregate of the change in market value from grant until issuance of the share (or lapse of restrictions would be reflected in the remuneration table upon such issuance (or lapse); appreciation would appear in Column C2. depreciation in Column D. See Question and Response 12 of Release No. 33=- 8166. However. in the case of a deferred of bonus arrangement of the type described in Question and Response 14 of Release No. 33-6166. where the bonus amount is expensed at time of deferral and phantom stock is credited to the employee's account. Column C1 would still be used to report the bonus amount, but the right to market appreciation of the phantomstock would be reported in effect as a SAR or phantom stock under item 4(dl.be reported in the Item 4(a) remuneration table. If earnings go up and, as a result, additional compensation is expensed for a period, it is appropriate to associate that expense with that period by continuing to report the expense in the remuneration table, The rules adopted today are designed only to remove from the remuneration table those options and SARs which, If left in the table, would cause compensation expenses and remuneration to fluctuate based on market value change through the period from grant to exercise or realization. The Commission believes that this change is responsive to the most serious distortions which have arisen. In adopting these amendments, the Commission has made the disclosure of options and SARs consistent. As to SARs not in tandem with options, Item 4(d)(iv) requires the following: (1) The number of rights'granted during the period and the average base price 33 thereof; (2) the number of rights outstanding at the end of the period: (3) the value of the cash or securities received upon exercise or realization of rights during the period; (4) the number of rights outstanding at the end of the period; and (5) the potential (unrealized) value of all rights outstanding at the end of the period. Unlike the proposals, the amendments do not call for unrealized gain for all rights outstanding at the beginning of the period and unrealized gain for rights granted during the period. The Commission agrees with the commentators who stated that such disclosure was unnecessary.3, Registrants are encouraged to combine the Item 4(d) disclosure of options and SARs wherever practicable under the circumstances. The consistency of the requirements will facilitate such integration. 3. Stock Appreciation Rights In Tandem With Options. In the May 1980 Release, the Commission solicited comments as to whether an Instruction should be included in Item 4(d) which would address possible double-reporting of SARs that are granted in tandem with options. In the past, many questions. have arisen concerning the reporting of tandem grants under Item 4(d). In most 34New Instruction 1Z to Item 4(d) defines \"base price\" as the amount used to define benefits which are available only to the extent that the market price of the underlying security exceeds such amount. For example, a SAR with a base price of $10 (the market price at time of grant] provides for payment of a benefit equal to the amount by which the market price at time of exercise Or realization exceeds $10. \"5See the discussion of option disclosure. supra. for the commentators' views regarding unrealized value at the end of the period. Federal Resister I Vol. 45, No. 227 I Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations 78989 cases, the holder may exercise either the SAR or the option, but not both. That is, the market appreciation on the underlying securities may be received in the form of cash or securities in lieu of receiving securities by paying the option price upon exercise of the tandem option. Commission filings indicate that a significant portion of all SARs are in tandem with options. The proposals would have required the separate reporting of SARs whether or not they were in tandem with options. Most commentators suggested that this would constitute double reporting of the same potential benefit and would cause confusing disclosure. Two major alternatives were advanced. (1) Disclosure of the tandem units in a combined table; and (2) separate disclosure of tandem grants coupled with an explanatory footnote. Several commentators suggested alternative tabular formats. The amendments require a combined presentation for tandem rights within the Item 4(d) option information. In the Commission's view, this is the most feasible and logical approath. Item 4(d)[i) will require the separate identification of the amount of securities subject to options granted during the period which are in tandem with SARs. Similarly, Item 4(d)(iii) will require the separate identification of the amount of securities subject to options outstanding at the end of the period which are in tandem vith SARs. All other information concerning tandem SARs will be included in the data concerning options.37 A definition of the term \"tandem\" has been added as new Instruction 11 to Item 4(d) which states, in pertinent part, \"[Ifor purposes of this Item 4(d), an option shall be deemed in tandem with a stock appreciationiight * * * if the benefits under one represent an alternative to or reduce the benefits available under the other.\" This definition was considered appropriate since it includes only those SARs for which double-reporting was a problem under the proposals. 4. Performance Unit Rights In Tandem With Options and/or SARs. During the comment process, it came to the Commission's attention that there are some companies that are granting performance unit rights (\"PURs\") in tandem with options and/or SARs. Typically, such plans allow the holder the alternative of exercising a PUR and receiving either cash or shares of stock, to the extent that predetermined 37See Table I of revised Appendix A to Schedule 14A in the Text of the Amendments for a possible presentation of such information.objectives are achieved, In lieu of exercising the related option or SAIL3 When both a SAR and a PUR are granted in tandem with an option, accounting practice requires the expensing of an amount relating to the PUR in a given year If that is the most likely employee alternatives based on the facts available. Two commentators suggested that by failing to exclude amounts expensed for such PURs from the remuneration table the proposals would result in the double-reporting of compensation. The Commission agrees that the appropriate location of tandem PUR information Is with the related option and SAR data. In this regard, new Instruction 3(b)(3) to Item 4(a) will exclude from Column D the financial reporting expense for any form of performance or other contingent compensation unit granted in tandem with an option or SAI. Instruction 12 to Item 4(d) will require that the existence of a tandem PUR be disclosed in reference to the related option or SAR and that any value realized from such unit shall be Included under the value realized from the exercise of the related option or SAR. Likewise, any accrual balance at the end of the period with regard to such PUR will be reported under potential (unrealized) value for the related option or right. The formulation of the term \"tandem\" in instruction 13 to Item 4(d) applies in the same manner with regard to PURs as it does with options and SARs. That is, a PUR will be deemed in tandem with an option and/or a SAR if the realization of value under the PUR will reduce or be an alternative to the realizable value under the option or SAR. F. Item 4(e)--Indebtedness of Management The Commission has adopted as proposed an amendment to Item 4(e) which expands the exception relating to indebtedness incurred in the ordinary course of business to savings and loan associations and to broker-dealers extending credit under Federal Reserve Regulation T. This proposal was generally supported by the commentators. Under the amendment, the specified entities will not have to furnish detailed disclosure with regard to loans extended to management if a statement is \"In many case the performance units granted under this method serve as a \"safety net' for the stock options or SARs. such that. if the stock market does not adequately reflect impro% ed company performance, the units will generate payments based on company financial results equal to a portion of a predetermined expected stock option or SAR valueIncluded that the loans to such persons: (1) Were made in the ordinary course of business; (2) were made on substantially the same terms, including interest and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons; and (3) did not involve more than the normal risk of collectibflity or present other unfavorable features.\" In the Commission's view, the same policy considerations regarding bank loans to management should apply to these other regulated industries.\" The Commission has also increased the de minimis exception in Instruction 2 to Item 4(e) from $10,000 to $25,00 to account for inflation. G. Item 4(f)-Transactions With Management In order to be consistent with the Item 4(a)(1) requirements, the de mininzis exclusion in Item 4(f) has been increased from $40,000 to $50,000. H. Item 4(h)-Termination of Employment Proposed Item 4(h) would have required a description of any remunerative plan or arrangement, not previously disclosed, that results or would result from the termination of employment of any individual named in the remuneration table in any of the last three fiscal years. Although a number of commentators suggested that information regarding termination arrangements may be required by other sections of the proxy rules, the Commission's experience in administering the remuneration disclosure requirements has indicated a lack of disclosure of such arrangements. The Commission continues to believe that such arrangements are significant to an assessment of the registrants compensation policy and should be disclosed. Accordingly, the proposed \" One commentator suggested that the exception be expanded to ude finance companies. The Commission is not convinced that the same sort of regulation as to insider loans exists for finance companies and therefore has not expanded upon the proposal The Commission for some time has had under consideration the possible modification of the scope of the exception for management indebtedness to regulated lending entities. In addition, the Commission staff is currently considering recommending to the Commission modifications of Item 6(b) of Schedule 14A (17 CFR 240.14a-I\"1]. which requires certain disclosure as to relationships in% ohs directors. and related aspects of Item 4(f) of Regulation S-K. which requires disclosure of transactions with officers and directors. See Di asion of Corporahon Finance. Securities and Exchange Commission. Staff Report on Corporate Accountability 96th Cong. 2nd Sess. 8-92 (Comm. Print 1960) (Senate Comm. on Banking. Housing and Urban Affairs).No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 19W0 / Rules and Regulations 7M99 Federal Register / vol. 4s, 76990 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations disclosure requirements are being adopted with revisions. To address certain of the concerns of the commentators and to provide meaningful disclosure to stockholders, a number of revisions have been incorporated into the Item. The first revision relates to the period of time covered by the Item. As adopted, the operative period, of time for disclosure of separation payments. for Item 4(a) -individuals has been reduced so as to require information with respect to individuals named in the Item 4(a) remuneration table either in the latest fiscal year or the preceding fiscal year.41 The commentators' suggestion that the period of time be limited to the latest fiscal year has not been adopted. Such a period would not require disclosure of separation payments made to an Item ,4(a) executive identified in the registrant's proxy statement for one year, but who terminated early-in the next year and whose remuneration for that next year, as a result of the termination in mid-year, is not sufficiently high to require naming that individual in the proxy material for that year. The Commission believes that such payments should be disclosed to stockholders and accordingly has - adopted the Item to include executives identified.in the preceding year's proxy statements. To eliminate the need to report immaterial termination paymgnts, however, a $50,000 de minimis exclusion has been incorporated into'the instructions. Although one commentator suggested that the Commission adopt a de minimi exemption based upon the level of remuneration reported in the Item 4(a) table, the Commission has adopted the $50,000 exemption since a specific dollar exclusion is consistent with the other de minimis levels set forth throughout the proxy rules, particularly Item 4(f) relating to transactions with management. Instruction 3 has been included to define the term \"previously disclosed\" for the purposes of Item 4(h). The term includes situations where the arrangements have been generally disclosed in prior proxy or information. statements filed with the Commission ,.pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act, notwithstanding the fact that the precise amount to be received by a given individual has not been disclosed. For example, a lump sum payment permissible under the terms of the registrant's pension plan would not be a disclosable-event under the Item 4(h) 4The proposal woWld have requiredinformation for persons named in the Item 4[a) table in any of the last three fiscal years.provided that the registrant had included in prior year's proxy statements full disclosure with regard to the registrant's pension plan pursuant to Item 4(b). L Incorporation of Prior Interpretations and Technical Changes In the May 1980 Release, the Commission reaffirmed the prior interpretive releases 42 in the area of' management remuneration and noted that certain portions of those releases remain in effect to the extent consistent with or not superseded by Item 4 as amended. In response to a number of requests to reflect as many of these - interpretations as possible in the clarifying amendments of Item 4, the Commission has incorporated into the text of the item those interpretive responses which have generic applications. For example, the first four basic disclosure concepts underlying the remuneration disclosure requirements set forth in Securities Act Release 6166 have been incorporated into Item 4. Similarly, the staff interpretive positions expressed in SecuritiesAct Release 6027 and interpretive responses 13, 20, 21, 22, 23, 30, 32 and 52 of Securities Act Release 6166 have also been incorporated into the item as amended. The Commission believes thet~he incorporation of these interpretations will assist registrants and their advisors in preparing the remuneration portions of their disclosure documents. The Commission, however, has not incorporated into Item 4 all the interpretive responses previously rendered by the staff, since such inclusioi would needlessly expand Item 4 with unnecessary detail and interpretations not having general applicability. Accordingly, with certain 4In Release No. 33-5856 (August 18, 1977) (42 FR 43058). the Commission expressed the view that the existing remuneration reporting provisioni required registrants to report as remuneration certain personal benefits or \"perquisites.\" These views were codified in Instruction 2(d) to Item 4(a) of Regulation S-K with the adoption of the amendments to Item 4 in December 1978 (Release No. 33-6003 (43 FR 58151)). In Release No. 33-5904 (February 8, 1978) (43 FR 6060), the Commission's. Division of Corporation Finance was authorized to publish its interpretive views regarding specific aspects of personal benefits disclosure. Although, the 1978 amendments did not alter the majority-of the interpretive responses expressed in the latter release, several interpretations were modified or superseded by certain provisions of the amended Item and by subsequent staff interpretation. See Release 33-6166 (December 12,1979) (44 FR 74808), Part V. 33-6027 (February 22.1979) (44 ER16368) and 33-6166 (December 12 1979). the Commission authorized the Division of Corporation Finance to publish its views with regard to certain interpretations of Item 4. See also, letter to ClarkHutton. Esq-regarding Manufacturers Hanover Corporation. dated January 24, 1980.exceptions,43 the interpretive positions expressed in those releases and not incorporated into Item 4 of Regulation S-K are still in effect and may be relied upon by the registrant in responding to the requirements of Item 4. As proposed, the Commission has renumbered certain paragraphs of Item 4 to conform these paragraphs and their subparts to the other section of the Item. The elimination of the Inconsistent numbering scheme as well as new underlining (or italicizing) and indentation techniques are Intended to improve the readability of the Item. The Commission has also adopted certain technical language changes which are designed to clarify the requirements and are not substantive In nature. Certain Findings As required by Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, the Commission has specifically considered the Impact which the amendments adopted herein would have on competition and has concluded that they would impose no significant burden on competition. In any event, the Commission has determined that any possible burden will be outweighed by, and is necessary and appropriate to achieve, the benefit of these amendments to investors and registrants.

This Item 4(a) applies to any individual who was an executive officer, officer, or director of the registrant at any time during the fiscal year, However, subject to the last sentence of Instruction 2(b) to Item 4(a), information need not be given for any portion of the period during which such individual was not an executive officer, officer, or director of the registrant, provided a statement to that effect is made. With respect to an individual who becomes for the first time an individual whose remuneration is to be reported in the table, it is not necessary to report remuneration which would have been reported in the table had the individual been included in prior years. For example, if a bonus was accrued for an individual and expensed for financial reporting purposes prior to the individual becoming an officer, the payment subsequent to the individual becoming an officer of the amount accrued and expensed for such bonus need not be reported. Item 4(a)(1) applies to executive officers and directors. Item 4(a)(2) applies to executive officers, other officers, and directors. Instruction 1[b) to Item 4(a). An \"executive officer\" of the registrant means its president. secretary, or treasurer, any vice president of the registrant in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration or finance), and any other individual who performs similar policy- making functions for the registrant. Executii e officers of subsidiaries may be deemed executive officers of the registrant if they perform such policy-making functions for the registrant. Instruction 1(c) to Item 4(a). Registrants should exercise a measure of flexibility in determining which individuals should be named in the remuneration table in order toavoid anomalous results and to assure that disclosure documents contain information on key policy-making members of management. Specifically. registrants may determine not to name a particular individual In the remuneration table when such individual otherwise might nominally be one of the fi% e most highly remunerated executive officers or directors. The types of matters a registrant should consider in exercising its discretion not to name an individual include: (i) The distribution or accrual of an unusually large amount (such as a bonus or commission), otherwise required to be reflected In Column C1 or Column C2. which is not part of a recurring arrangement and is unlikely to continue under the terms of the plan or any similar plan: and (i) the distribution or accrual of amounts relating to o% erseas assignments which may be attributed predominantly to such assignments. Howe%. er. a registrnt should nut apply the above standards mechanically; consideration should be gi% en to the question of whether an indi% idual's level of executih P responsibilities. ,, iewed in cuajanction with the individual's actual level of remuneration, would give rise to a conclusion that the indi% idual may be among the fi e most highly compensated. key policyi-mking executive officers or direLtors While the criteria set forth abmx e mal be used to dtermine which of The executive officers or directors shall be named in the table, the same standards should not be used as a ba is for deleting such ,,mounts from the remuneration table in response to Item 4b-Ir2l Thus, while the abune standards auight alluw a particular indix ulual not to be one of those individually named, all relevant amounts should be reflected in the tables group totals with no exclusions based on the abo. e standards.

Remuneration conditioned on substantial future service is subject to future events under this standard. Similarly, if the amount or value of, or entitlement to, remuneration is dependent on future earnings performance or market ;alues, such r6muneration is subject to future events under this standard. However, if dependence on future events does not represent a true contingency, remuneration should be reported in Column C. Instruction 3 to Item 4(a). Column D. Column D shall include reiuneration of the specified individuals and group in whole or in part for services rendered during the fiscal year, including but not limited to the forms of remuneration described in paragraphs (al through (c) below, if such remuneration is properly expensed for fmancial reporting purposes, and the measurement of benefits thereunder or the distribution or unconditional vesting thereof is subject to future events, so that the remuneration is therefore not reportable in Column C.

(2) If the registrant has expensed amounts for financial reporting purpotes and reported such amounts in the remuneration table and, in a subsequent year, in connection with the same plan or arrangement, credits Its remuneration expense for financial reporting purposes, for any proper reason, such credit may be reflected as a reduction of the remuneration reported In Column D. If amounts credited pursuant to this instruction are so reflected In the table, include'a footnote briefly stating the amount of such credit and describing such treatment. In situations in which there are several plans and virtually everyone in the remuneration table Is a participant in each plan, to the extent that negative entries in Column D for / individuals and for the group are attributable to the same factors, the footnote disclosure required by this Instruction 3(b)(2) to Item 4[a) may be generic in nature. If negative entries reflect changes in several types of plans or other factors not common to all individuals and the group, and separate disclosure would result in lengthy narrative, it is sufficient to provide a general explanation of the circumstances giving rise to negative entries without a separate explanation of the components of each negative entry for individuals or the group, Excessivedetall should be avoided. (3) The financial reporting expense (or credit) for any form of performance or other contingent compensation granted In tandem with options or rights under plans for which disclosure is called for by Item 4(d) shall be excluded from Column D, and the Information required by Instruction 12 to Item 4(d) shall be presented.

Item 4(a) does not require disclosure of remuneration paid to a partnership in which any officer or director was a partner; any such transactions should be disclosed pursuant to these other disclosure requirements, and not as a note to the remuneration table presented pursuant to Item 4(a). InstructioR 5 to Item 4(a). Other permitted disclosure. The registrant may provide additional disclosure through one or more footnotes to the table, through additional lines or columns, or otherwise, describing the components of aggregate remuneration in such greater detail as is appropriate.

Instruction 3 to Item 4(b]. If the registrant has a defined benefit or acturerlal pension plan or plans which are such that the use of the Item 4(b)(2) pension table is inappropriate to inform stockholders of the pension benefits that the Item 4(a) individuals may receive, because the pension benefits are not determined primarily by final compensation (or averae final compensation) and years of service (such as a plan where the annual benefit is determined by a summation of a certain amount or certain percentage of compensation for each year of the individual's entire career, the registrant should describe the plan as required by Item 4(b)(2) together with the formula by which benefits are determined, and indicate the estimated annual benefits payable upon retirement at normal retirement age for the individuals specified in Item 4(a).

Instructions to Item 4(d) Instruction I to Item 4(d). The term\"options\" as used in this Item 4(d) includes all options, warrants or rights, other than those issued to security holders as such on a pro rata basis. Where the average option price per share is called for, the weighted average price per share shall be given.

Thus, this definition may include interests in certain plans, such as some phantom stock plans, which are not denominated as stock appreciation right plans. For the purposes of this Item 4(d), if reference is made to a number of options or stock appreciation rights, such number should correspond to the number of securities to which the options or rights relate. Instruction 2 to Item 4(d).

Instruction 8 to Item 4(d). In calculating the potential (unrealized) value of outstanding rights or 6ptions, the value of an option or right shall be determined as though it had been exercised or realized on the valuation -date, and without regard to the fact that actual realization of any of or all benefits under the option or right may be subject to unsatisfied contingencies or conditions. All outstanding rights or options with exercise or base prices above the market price on the valuation date shall be disregarded in making this calculation; the total should reflect only options or rights with positive unrealized values and should not be reduced by negative unrealized values. Instruction 9 to Item 4(D). If securities rather than cash are received upon the exercise or realization of a stock appreciation right, the fair market value of said securities on the date of exercise or realization should be reported pursuant to this Item 4(d). Instruction 10 to Item 4(d).

Instruction 11 to Item 4(d). The base price of a stock appreciation right is the amount used to define benefits which are aVailable only to the extent that the market price of the underlying security exceeds such amount. For example, a stock appreciation right with a base price of $10 (the market price on date of grant) provides for payment of a benefit equal to the amount by which the market price at time of exercise exceeds $10. In the case of a phantom stock right providing for payment of the full value of a share, withoutreduction by or payment of any amount, the base price is zero. Instructiob 12 to Item 4(d). If a performance unit or other contingent compensation right (other than an option or stock appreciation right) is in tandem with an option or stock appreciation right, the existence of such right shall be disclosed either with Information about options pursuant to Item 4(d)(l)-(lll) (If such right Is In tandem with an option or with a stock appreciation right which, Is Itself In tandem with an option) or with Information about stock appreciation rights pursuant to Item 4(d)(iv) (if such right Is In tandem only with a stock appreciation right with Is not itself in tandem with an option). The value realized from such rights shall be Included as value realized upon exercise or realization of optionsror stock appreciation rights, as the case may be, and shall not be reported pursuant to Item 4(a) or Item 4(c); and the potential (unrealized) value of such rights shall be taken into account In determining the potential (unrealized) value of options or stock appreciation rights, as the case may be. See Instructions 8 and 13 to Item 4(d). Instiuction 13 to Item 4fd). For purposes of this Item 4(d), an option shall be deemed In tandem with a stock appreciation right, and a performance unit or other contigent compensation right will be deemed In tandem with an option'or stock appreciation right, and vice versa in each instance, If the benefits under one represent an-alternative to or reduce the benefits available under the other. Where rights or options are In tandem with one another, a registrant shall present, as potential (unrealized) value, the maximum amount which may be realized under such rights and/or options If all were exercised and/or realized on the valuation date In thu manner most beneficial to the holder (without counting more than one of any benefits which are alternative to one another).

Box 3599, Des Moines, IA 5032. is the sponsor of supplemental NADA 91-783 providing for use of a premix containing 4 grams of tylosin (as tylosin phosphate) per pound. in addition to an existing approval for use of a 10-gram-per-pound premix, for making complete swine feeds used to increase rate of weight gain and improve feed efficiency. Approval of this application is based on safety and effectiveness data contained in Elanco Products Co.'s approved NADA 12-491. Use of the data in NADA 12491 to support this supplement has been authorized by Elanco. This approval does not change the approved use of the drug. Consequently, approval of this NADA poses no increased human risk from exposure to residues of the animal drug. nor does it change the conditions of the drug's safe use in the target animal species. Accordingly, under the Bureau of Veterinary Medicine's supplemental approval policy (42 FR 64367; December 23,1977]. approval of this supplemental NADA did not require reevaluation of safety and effectiveness data in NADA 12-491.

Sauber, Project Officer, Office of State Programs, Occupational, Safety and Health Administration, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, D.C. 20210, [=0) 523-021. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Hawaii Occupational Safety and Health plan was approved under Section 18(c) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 667(c)] (hereinafter called the Act) and Part 1902 of this Chapter on January 4,1974 (39 FR 1010]. Part 1953 of the Chapter provides procedures for the review and approval of State change supplements by the Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health (hereinafter called the Assistant Secretary. Hawaii's change supplement regarding variance egulations was submitted in response to Federal review of Hawaii's previous temporary variance submission. Federal OSHA objected to the previous regulation, which was comparable to neither the Federal temporary nor permanent variance regulations. Federal reguhions allow for temporary variances only before the effective date of a standard, and require the applicant to state when he will comply with the standard. Federal regulations allow for pernanent variances only if the employer provides equivalent proiection. The previous Hawaii regulation appeared to allow for variances after the effectie date of a standard without requiring the employer to provide equivalent protection. To address this Federal concern, Hawaii offered an assurance that a temporary variance would be granted only under specified conditions when it would provide employee protection equivalent or superior io that afforded by the standard, and when it wod be the safest feasible solution after al relevant factors had been considered. This change supplement amends the Hawaii variance regulations to incorporate this assurance. Description of Supplements A. Recardkeepir, Regulation. In August 1977, Jauary 1978, August 1978 and August 1979, Hawaii amended its regulations on recording and reporting occupational injuries and illnesses (chapter 103 of the Hawaii occupational safeto and health standards, rules and regulations]. These amendments, which reflect changes to the comparable Federal regulations (29 CFR Part 1904), include access to records by employees, former employees and theirrepresentatives, and changes in recordkeeping forms. B. Variance Regulations. In August 1979, the State amended its rules of practice for variances (chapter 104 of the Hawaii occupational safety and health standards, rules and regulations] to clarify the criteria for granting short- term variances. These variances will only be granted under specified conditions, where they will provide protection equivalent or superior to that afforded by the standard, and when approved procedure will be the safest feasible solution after all relevant factors have been considered. Location of the Plan and Its Supplements for Inspection and Copying A copy of the supplements, along with the approved plan, may be inspected and copied during normal business hours at the following locations: Office of State Programs, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 3rd and Constitution Avenues NW., Room N- 3613, Washington D.C. 20210; Regional Administrator, Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 450 Golden Gate Avenue, Room 11321.

Public Participation Under \u00a7 1953.2(c) of this Chapter, the Assistant Secretary may prescribe alternative procedures to expedite the review process or for any good cause which may be consistent with applicable laws. The Assistant Secretary finds that the Hawaii plan supplements described above are consistent with State plan regulations generally, and with 29 CPR Part 1902 Subpart B, particularly. Good cause is therefore found for approval of the supplements without public comment and notice. Decision After careful consideration, the Hawaii plan supplements described above are hereby approved under Part 1953 of this chapter. This decision incorporates the requirements of the Act and implementing regulations applicable to State plans generally. In accordance with this decision, Subpart Y of 29 CFR 1952 is amended by adding a new section and paragraph as follows: 11952.315 Changes to approved plans. (a) In accordance with Subparts C and E of Part 1953 of this Chapter, the following plan change supplements, effective August 1979, were approved bythe Assistant Secretary on November 13, 190. (1) Hawaii amended its regulations on recordkeeping and reporting of occupational injuries and illnesses to allow access to records by employees, former employees and their representatives, and also to change its recordkeeping forms. (2) Hawaii amended its variance rules to clarify the fact that temporary variances will only be granted under specified conditions, where equivalent or superior protection is assured and where the variance is the safest feasible solution.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION. Background Part 1953 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, provides procedures under Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 667] (hereinafter called the Act] for review of changes and progress in the 77002 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations development and implementation of State plans which have been approved in accordance with Section 18(c) of the Act and 29 CFR Part 1902. On September 28,1976, notice was published in the Federal Register (41 FR 42655] of the approval of the Virginia Plan and the adoption of Subpart EE containing the decision and describing the Plan. By - letters dated February 18, 1977, and March 31, 1977, from Edmond M. Boggs, Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry, and by letters dated May 4, 1977, September 12, 1977, January 4,1978, March 1, 1978, and August 15,1978, from Robert F. \" Beard Jr., Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry, to David H. Rhone, Regional Administrator, the State of Virginia submitted State-initiated and developmental change supplemehts. Following regional review, the supplements were forwarded tQ the Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health (hereinafter called the Assistant Secretary) for -determination as to whether they should be approved. The supplements are described below. Description of the Supplements 1. Enforcement of Fire Standards. In accordance with the requirement of the developmental step set forth in 29 CFR 1952.373(b), the State of Virginia was to develop a plantor delegation of authority to the State Fire Marshal for fire standards development and enforcement, to be completed by December 31, 1976, with necessary legislative action and program implementation by July 1, 1978. By a letter dated February 18, 1977, the State requested an extended deadline of April 1, 1978, for completion of an agreement with the State Fire Marshal's Office. In the interim, the Department of Labor and Industry would conduct inspections and enforcement of fire standards. By an additional letter dated August 15, 1978, the State announced that it was unable to arriie at an agreement with the State Fire Marshal acceptable to OSHA and therefore asked that the State Fire Marshal Agreement be deleted from the State Plan. The responsibility for enforcing fire standards would remain with the Department of Labor and Industry. 2. State Posters. In accordance with the requirements of the developmental step set forth in 29 CFR 1952.373(c), the State was to have developed and distributed posters informing public and private eniployees of their rights and responsibilities. On May4, 1977, the State submitted a poster which is required to be posted in all privateworkplaces. A poster for public employees was submitted on September 12,1977. The posters contain, among other things, provisions notifing employees of their obligations and rights under the Virginia Occupational Safety and Health Law, their right to request workplace inspections and their right to remain anonymous, their protection against discharge and discrimination for the exercise of their rights under Federal and/or State laws, and their right to file complaints concerning the admiriistration of the State program with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 3. Voluntary Compliance Program. In accordance with the requirement of the development step set forth in 29 CFR 1952.373(d), the State was to have developed and initiated a program to encourage voluntary compliance by employers and employees, including provision for on-site consultation services, which program will not detract from its enforcement program. By a letter dated March 31, 1977, the State announced that a voluntary compliance program, which included on-site consultation, had become olerative on March 15,1977. On October 1, 1977 the State entered into an agreement under Section 7(c)(1) of the Act with the U.S. Department of Labor for on-site c6nsultation services in the private sector. By a letter dated March 1, 1978, the State announced that on-sit& consultation services for the private sector were no longer provided for by the voluntary compliance program of the State Plan. Safety and health education and training activities, as well as on-site consultation for the public sector, were retained under the voluntary compliance program of the State Plan. 4. On-Site Consultation Program Staffing. In accordance with the requirement of the development step set forth in 29 CFR 1953.373(1), both safety and health consultation programs were to be fully staffed by Fiscal Year 1979. As mentioned above, on-site consultation in the private sector was covered by a Section 7(c)(1) agreement between the State and the U.S. Department of Labor as of October 1, 1977. The State plan did retain, however, provisions for on-site consultation in the public sector. Monitoring by OSHA has verified that the State's public sector on- site consultation program is fully staffed. 5. Management Information System. In accordance with the requirement of the developmental step set forth in 29 CFR 1952.373(g), the designee was to have developed and implemented an automated Management InformationSystem within 6 months of plan approval. By a letter dated January 4, 1978, the State announced that Its Management Information System had become fully operational on July 1, 1977, Monitoring activities conducted by OSHA have verified the system's completion. The Court reporting system, also included in 29 CFR 1952.373(g), Is not approved by this notice. 6. Merit System Coverage. In accordance with the requirement of the developmental step set forth in 29 CFR 1952.373(1), Virginia was to bring the positions of Director of the Industry Safety Division and Director of the Construction Safety Division in the Department of Labor and Industry trder, the State merit system. By a letter dated February 18, 1977, the State announced that the two positions had ben under the State merit system as of September 1, 1976. The U.S. Civil Service Commission, by a letter dated March 23, 1977, verified that the State had fulfilled this commitment. Location of the Plan and Its Supplements for Inspection and Copying Copies of the supplements, along with the approved plan, may be inspected and copied during normal business hours at the following locations: Office of the Director of Federal Compliance and State Programs, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, Room N-3613, 3rd and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, D.C. 20210; Technical Data Center, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, Room N-2439, 3rd and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, D.C. 20210; Office of the Regional Administrator, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, Room 2100, Gateway Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104: and, the Office of the Commissioner, Department of Labor and Industry, 205 North Fourth Street, Richmond, Virginia 23241. Public Participation Under \u00a7 1952.2(c) of this chapter, the Assistant Secretary may prescribe alternative procedures to expedite the review process or for any other'good cause which may be consistent with applicable law. The Assistant Secretary finds that the Virginia Plan supplements described above are consistent with commitments contained In the approved plan, which was previously made availble for public comment. Accordingly, it is found that further ,public comment and notice is - unnecessary. Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations 77003 Decision After careful consideration, the Virginia plan supplements outlined above are approved under 29 CFR Part 1953. This decision incorporates the requirements of the Act and implementing regulations applicable to State Plans generally. In addition, Subpart EE of 29 CFR Part 1952 is amended to reflect the completion of six developmental steps by adding a new section as follows: \u00a7 1952.374 Completed developmental steps. (a) In accordance with 29 CFR 1952.373(b), Virginia was to develop a plan for delegation of authority to the State Fire Marshal for fire standards enforcement. The State has since announced that the authority for fire standards enforcement will rest with the Department of Labor and Industry, which has been enforcing fire standards since plan approval. This action is judged to have sufficiently fulfilled the commitments of this step. (b) In accordance with 29 CFR 1952.373(c) and 1952.10. Virginia's safety and health posters for public and private employers were approved by the Assistant Secretary on November 13, 1980. Cc) In accordance with 29 CFR 1952.373(d), Virginia initiated a voluntary compliance program which includes on-site consultation services on March 15,1977. (The State subsequently arranged for on-site consultation activities for the private sector to be covered by an agreement with the U.S. Department of Labor under Section 7(c)(1) of the Act). (d) In accordance with 29 CFR 1952.373(f), the State had met its developmental commitment for the staffing of its on-site consultation program in the public sector by fiscal year 1979. On-site consultation in the private sector is covered by a Section 7(c](1) agreement with the U.S. Department of Labor. (e) In accordance with the relevant part of 29 CFR 1952.373(g), Virginia met its developmental commitment of developing and implementing an automated Management Information System on July 1, 1977. (f) In accordance with 29 CFR 1952.373(1], the Directors of the Industry and the Construction Safety Divisions have been placed under the State merit system as of September 1, 1976. (Sec. 18, Pub.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: General Background on the Permanent Program The environmental protection provisions of SMCRA are being Implemented in two phases-the initial program and the permanent program-in accordance with Sections 501-503 of SMCRA. 30 U.S.C. 1251-1253. The initial program became effective on February 77004 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations 3, 1978, for new coal mining operations on non4ederal and non-Indian lands which received state permits on or after that date, and was effectuated on May 3, 1978, for all coal mines existing on that date. The initial programrules were promulgated by the Secretary on December 13,1977, under 30 CFR Parts 710-725, 42 FR 62639, et seq. The permanent program will become effective in each state upon the approval of a state program by the Secretary of the Interior or implementation of a federal program within the state. If a state program is approved, the state, rather than the federal government, will be the primary Tegulator of activities subject to SMCRA. The federalregulations for the permanent program, including procedures for states to followin submitting state programs and minimum standards and procedures for approval, are found in 30 CFR Parts 700-707 and 730-865. Part 705 was published October 20, 1977 (42 FR 56064), and.Parts 795 and 865 (originally Part 830] were published December 13, 1977 (42 FR 62639). The other permanent program regulations were published March 13,1979 (44 FR 15312-15463). Errata Notices were 66195), 26001J, June 5, 1980 (45' FR 37818), and July 15, 1980 (45 FR 47424). Amendments to the regulations were published October 22,1979 (44 FR 60969), and September 4,1980 (45 FR 58780-58786) as corrected December 19, 1979 (44 FR 75143), December 19, 1979 (44 FR 75303), December 31, 1979 (44 FR 77440-77447), January FR 2626-2629), April 25998- 26001), May June 10, 1980 (45 FR 39440- 39447), August 6, 1980 (45 FR 52306- 52324) and August 7, 1980 (45 FR 52375). Portions of these regulations have been suspended, pending further rulemaking. See 44 FR 67942 (November 27i 1979), 44 FR 77447-77454 (December 31, 1979), 45 FR 6913 (January 30, 1980) and 45 FR 51547-51550 (August 4, 1980). General Background on State Program Approval Process Any state wishing to assume primary jurisdiction for the regulation of coal mining under SMCRA may submit a program for consideration. The Secretary of the Interior has the responsibility to approve or disapprove the submission. The federal regulations governing .state program submissions are found at 30 CFR Parts 730-732. After review of the submission by OSM and otheragencies, as well as an opportunity for the state to make additions or modifications to the program, and an opportunity for public comment, the Secretary may either approve the program; approve it conditioned upon the correction of minor deficiencies in accordance with a specified timetable; or disapprove the program in whole or in part. If the program is disapproved, the state may submit revisions to correct the items thatneed to be changed to meet the requirements of SMC1L. and the applicable federal regulations. If the revised program is also disapproved, SMCRA requires the Secretary of the Interior to establish a federal program in that state. The state may again request approval to assume primary jurisdiction after the federal program has been implemented. As a result of litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, in which the deadline for sfates to submit proposed programs was extended from August 3,1979, to March .3, 980, 30 CER 732.11(d) was amended to provide that program submissions that do not contain all required and fully enacted laws and regulations by the 104th day following program submission be disapproved pursuant to the procedures for the Secretary's initial decision in Section132.13 t45 FR 33927, May 20, 1980). The1A4th day following Arkansas' submission was June 2; 1980. The Secretary's rules for the review of State programs implement his policy that industry, the public, and other agencies of government should have a meaningful opportunity to participate in his decisions. TheSecretary also has a policy that a State should be afforded the maximum opportunity possible to change its program, when necessary, to correct any deficiencies in it. The Secretary, in reviewing state programs, is utilizing the criteria of Section 503 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253) and 30 CFR 732.15. In reviewing the Arkansas .program, the Secretary has followed the federal rules as cited above under \"General Background on the Permanent Program,\" and as affectedby decisions of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in In Re: Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation. Because of that litigation, the court issued its initial decision in two \"rounds.\" The Round I opinion, dated February 26, 1980, denied several generic attacks on the permanent program regulations, but resulted in suspension or remanding of all or part of twenty-two specific regulations. The Round II opinion, dated May 16, 1980, denied additional generic attacks on the regulations, but remanded some 40additional parts, sections or subsections of the regulations. The court also ordered the Secretary to \"'affirmatively disapprove, under Section 503 (of SMCRA), those segments of a state program that incorporate a suspended or remanded regulation\" (Mem. Op., May 16, 1980, p. 49). However, on August 15, 1980, the court stayed this portion of Its judgment. The effect of this stay Is to allow the Secretary to approve state program provisions equivalent to remanded or suspended federal provisions in the three circumstances described in paragraph-i, below. Therefore, the Secretary is applying the following standards to the review of state program submissions. 1. The Secretary need not affirmatively disapprove state provisions similar to those federal regulations which have been suspended or remanded by the district court where the state has adopted such provisions In a ruidmaking or legislative proceeding which occurred either (a) before the, enactment of SMCRA or (2) after the date 6f the Round U District Court decision, since'such state regulations clearly are not based solely upon the suspended or remanded federal regulations. (3) The Secretary need not affirmatively disapprove provisions based upon suspended or remanded federal rules if a responsible state official has requested the Secretary to approve them. 2. The Secretary will affirmatively disapprove, to the extent required by the court's judgements, all provisions of a state program which incorporate suspended or remanded federal rules and which do not fall into one of the three categories in paragraph one, above. The Secretary believes that the effect of his \"affirmative disapproval\" of a section in the State's regulations Is that the requirements of that section are not enforceable in the permanent program at the federal level to the extent they have been disapproved. Thatis, no cause of action for enforcement of the provisions, to the extent disapproved, exists in the federal courts, and no federal inspection will result in notices of violation or cessation orders based upon the \"affirmatively disapproved\" provisions. The Secretary takes no position as to whether the affirmatively disapproved provisions are enforceable under state law hind in state courts. Accordingly, these provisions are not being prb-empted or suspended, although the Secretary may have the power to do so under Section 504(g) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11. 3. A state program need not contain provisions to implement a suspended Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations 77005 regulation and no state program will be disapproved for failure to contain a suspended or remanded regulation. 4. A state must have authority to implement all permanent program provisions of SMCRA. including those provisions of SMCRA upon which the Secretary based remanded or suspended regulations. 5. A state program may not contain any provision which is inconsistent with a provision of SMCRA. 6. Progeras will be evaluated only on those provisions other than the provisions that must be disapproved because of the court's order. The remaining provisions will be approved, conditionally approved or disapproved, in whole or part, in accordance with 30 CFR 732.13. 7. Upon promulgation of new regulations to replace those that have been suspended or remanded, the Secretary will afford states that have approved or conditionally approved programs a reasonable opportunity to amend their programs, as appropriate. In general, the Secretary expects that the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17 will govern this process. A list of the regulations suspended or remanded as the result of the Round I and Round II litigation was published in a previous Federal Register notice (45 FR 45604, July 7, 1980). A proposed list of Arkansas provisions incorporating the suspended or remanded federal regulations was published at 45 FR 50820-50823 (July 31, 1980). To codify decisions on state programs, federal programs, and other matters affecting individual states, OSM has established a new Subchapter T of 30 CFR Chapter VII. Subchapter T will consist of Parts 900 through 950. Provisions relating to Arkansas will be found in 30 CFR Part 904. Background on the Arkansas Program Submission On February 19,1980, OSM received a proposed regulatory program from the State of Arkansas. The program was submitted by the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology (DPCE), the agency designated as the primary regulatory authority under the proposed Arkansas permanent program. Notice of receipt of the submission initiating the program review was published in the February 27,1980, Federal Register (45 FR 12918-12919) and in newspapers of general circulation in Arkansas. The announcement invited public participation in the initial phase of the review process as it related to the regional director's determination of whether the submission was complete.On March 31, 1980, the regional director held a public review meeting in Little Rock. Arkansas. on the program submission and its completeness. The public comment period on completeness began on February 27, 1980, and closed March 31, 1980. On April 9, 1980, the regional director published notice in the Federal Register announcing that the Arkansas program submission had been determined to be complete (45 FR 24210-24211). On May 30,1980, the Arkansas DPCE submitted to OSM numerous revisions to the Arkansas permanent program submission. A number of the revisions were minor in nature such as corrections of typographical errors, incorrect references to section numbers in the Arkansas Act and proposed regulations, dropped lines and other items of clarification. These minor modifications will not be discussed or summarized in this notice. However, the significant modifications to the February 19, 1980, Arkansas program submission are listed below: Regulations 1. Arkansas modified Section 705.21(b) to provide that the Director of the Arkansas DPCE file his or her appeal in conflict of interest proceedings, in writing, with the OSM Director. 2. Arkansas added language at Section 764.17(a) prohibiting cross- examination of witnesses at hearings on petitions to designate lands unsuitable and required that a transcript be made of all such hearings. 3. Arkansas modified Section 780.15 making mandatory the inclusion of a fugitive dust control plan in a mine permit application. 4. Arkansas revised Sections 784.13 and 784.23 to include references to require specific information for underground mine operation plans. 5. Arkansas added language to Section 784.14 to provide that reclamation plans for underground mining include a description of measures to insure the protection of water quality. 6. Arkansas deleted a provision found at Section 785.17(e) that allowed exceptions based on the size of prime farmland acreage. 7. Arkansas revised the definition of\"willful violation\" in Section 786.5[b) to include violations of federal laws. 8. Arkansas modified Section 786.11(c) to require that written notification of the filing of a permit application be sent to the United States Environmental Protection Agency and other federal and local governmental agencies as identified by the permit applicant.9. Arkansas deleted language in Section 786.11(d) regarding the approval of specific portions of a permit application within sixty days. 10. Arkansas added the words \"Secretary or the\" to Section 786.27(b) requiring a permit applicant, as a condition of the permit, to allow federal inspectors on the applicant's premises. 11. Arkansas modified Section 788.12(a)(1) to specify parameters for determining what changes constitute significant departures in the revision of a mining permit. 12. Arkansas modified Section 807.11 so that objectors to a bond release are not required to seek an adjudicatory hearing until after a decision by the Director. 13. Arkansas modified Section 842.14 to require a response to inspection complaints within fifteen days of receipt. 14. Arkansas modified Section 845.12(a) to provide specific authority to the Director to suspend underground coal mining, without civil penalty, upon a finding of imminent danger to the inhabitants of urbanized areas. 15. Arkansas submitted a new part, \"Part 1000 Effective Date,\" which addresses (a) the effective date of the regulations, (b) the status of Part 850 (Blaster Certification), (c) the status of the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Program and (d) the identification of regulations that have been suspended or remanded as a result of litigation involving OSM's permanent program regulations, together with a statement of the status of such regulations in the Arkansas program. 16. Arkansas added provisions at Part 900 establishing administrative hearing procedures including filing of pleadings, discovery, intervention, award of costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, and the appointment of presiding officers. Program Narrative 1. Section 731.14(b). Arkansas added specific provisions of the Arkansas Rules of Civil Procedure (ARCP). 2. Section 731.14(c). Arkansas revised the section-by-section comparison to include Ark. Stat. Ann. Sections 41-2801, 41-2807,41-901, and 41-1101 that provide for the protection of state employees. Also submitted for inclusion in the section-by-section comparison was information to (a) show that Section 23 of the Arkansas Act is as stringent as Section 516(c) of SMCRA as it pertains to the issuance of cessation orders under conditions of imminent danger to the public, and (b) explain how 761.11(c) and 761.12(f) are consistent with Section 522(e](3) of SMCRA and 30 CFR Part 761 77006 Federal Register I Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday,. November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations regarding approval to mine on certain federal, public andprivate lands. 3. Section 731.14(g)(4).

Arkansas submitted a revised budget and indicated that permit fees will -be used in funding the permanent program. Additional Amendments On July 2,1980, the Arkansas DPCE submitted to OSM some additional material to its permanent program submission. The material included some minor modifications which will not be summarized in this notice.The significant revisions to the program, as submitted July 2, 1980, are listed below: 1. Section 807.11 (f0 and (g). Procedures for public participation in the release of a performance bond. 2. Section 786.11(c). Public notice of filing of permit applications, specifically, the written notification to government agencies. 3. Part 1000 that had been submitted on May 30,1980 was further revised as follows: (a) Part 1000 (10)-Section 785.17(a). This regulation is suspended to the extent that it limits the prime farmland exemption from reconstruction requirements to persons with permits issued on mining plans approved prior to August 3, 1977. (b) Part 1000 (22)-Section 816.103(a)(1). This regulation is suspended to the extent that it does not allow treatment as.an alternative to covering coal andacid- or toxic-forming materials. (c) Part 1000 (30)-Part 779. The term\"mine plan area\" as it appears in this Part is suspended. The Pollution Control Commission suggested that the term\"permit area\" be substituted, with the exception of the determination of probable hydrologic consequences that must be measured both on and off the mine site. 4. Section 816.65(e)(2). 100 Hz was revised to 200Hz for the measurement of fiequency responses of airblasts. 5. Section 940.1(aJ(2). Criteria for granting temporary relief were added.6. Section 940.3(b). A procedure was added for expedited review of temporary relief proceedings. In addition to these program modifications, OSM received on July 2. 1980, a letter from Arkansas DPCE Director Jarrell Southall requesting that the Secretary consider and evaluate the Arkansas regulations which would be fully enacted on July 25,1980. This letter is discussed below under \"Elements Upon Which the Arkansas Program is Being..valuated for This Decision.\" On June 6, 1980, the regional director published notice in the Federal Register (45 FR 38088-38090) and in newspapers of general circulation within the State that the revisions to the Arkansas permanent program were available for public review and comment. The notice also set forth procedures for the public hearing and comment period on the substance of the Arkansas program. - On July 8, 1980, the regional director of OSM and the Director of the Arkansas OPCE held a joint public, hearing on the Arkansas submission in Fort Smith, Arkansas. The public comment period on the Arkansas permanent regulatory program ended on July 16, 1980. On July 18, 1980, the regional director submitted to the Director of OSM his recommendation that the Arkansas program be approved in part and disapproved in part, together with copies of the transcripts of the public meeting and public hearing,-written presentations, exhibits, copies of all public comments received and other documents comprising the administrative record. On July 30, 1980, the Director published notice in the Federal Register (45 FR 50616) that the views of federal agencies concerned with or having a special interest in the Arkansas program were available for public review. On July 31, 1980, the Director announced in the Federal Register (50820-;50823] the reopening of the public review period on the Arkansas regulatory program to allow public \"commen't on the following: (1) program revisions submitted to OSM on July 2, 1980; (2) DPCE Director Southall's July 2, 1980, letter to OSM requesting that regulations enacted on July 25, 1980 be considered as part of the program submission (discussed belowunder \"Elements Upon Which the Arkansas -Program is Being Evaluated For This Decision\"); (3) the accuracy of a proposed list of Arkansas' regulations to be affirmatively disapproved pursuant to the U.S. District Court opinion on state provisions comparable to suspended.or remanded federalregulations (See \"General Background on the Permanent Program\"). On August 14,1980, Arkansas also submitted a letter. (1) requesting that the Secretary approve the civil penalty'system described in Section 845.13 of the Arkansas regulations; (2) explaining that Arkansas Stat. Ann. Section 52-612, which prohibits -women from working in underground mines, appears unconstitutional; and (3) describing a proposed amendment to Section 786.19(h) of the Arkansas Code concerning payment of reclamation fees prior to approval of a permit application. Oh August 22, 1980, the Director of OSM, by telegram, asked Arkansas If there were provisions In its program based on suspended or remanded federal rules which the State does not want the Secretary to affirmatively disapprove in accordance with the court order. Arkdnsas has not yet replied, although, as noted above, on August 14, 1980 Arkansas asked that the civil penalty provisions be approved (Administrative Record No. AR-110). On October 1, 1980, the Administrator of the EPA concurred in the Secretary's' approval of those provisions of tha Arkansas program relating to air and water quality standards being approved today. On September 8, 1980, the Director of OSM submitted his recommendation to the Secretary that the Arkansas program be conditionally approved. Elements Upon Which the Arkansas Program Is'Being Evaluated for This Decision In this section, the Secretary discusses the elements of the proposed Arkansas program upon which the findings and decisions below are being made, (a) The statutes and program narrative received on February 19, 1980, and the revisions to the program narrative submitted on May 30, 1980, have been evaluated, The revisions were announced to the public on June 0, 1980, prior to the required public hearing, held July 8, 1980, and could have been commented on up to a week after the public hearing as well as at the public hearing. (b)The regulations fully enacted on July, 25,1980. On July 2, 1980, Arkansas DPCE Director Jarrell Southall requested that the Arkansas regulations, which would become enacted on July 25, 1980, be evaluated as a part of the program although they had not been enacted by the 104th day after the program was submitted. Director Southall stated he made this request because the public Fedeal RAister / Vol. 45, No. 227 1 Friday, November 21. 1980 / Rules and Regulations 77007 had full opportunit to cnment on the proposed regulations ihrovghout the review process and public comment periods. The Secretary grmts the request by Director Southall because: 1. The State of Arkansas did enact its proposed regulations on July 25. 1980. The regulations as fully enacted are identical to the regalati ns as proposed and submitted to the public for review, with two minor difereaces. 2. The Secretary solicited public comment regarding Arkansas' request for a waiver of the 104 day rule (FR 50820-50 , July 31. 1980]. Therefore, the public was given notice that the proposed, but not fully enacted. regulations may be considered as elements upon which the dicision- making would be based. 3. No public comments were received as a result of the Fedesal Register notice of July 3. 1980, and the Secretary inteprets this to mean that no members of the public object to the waiver being granted. 4. Adequate time has been provided to the public to comment on the fully enacted regulations of the proposed program. Thus, the Secretary believes that the purpose of the V4 day rule has been fulfilled. , Secretary's Findings 1. In accordance with Section 503(a) of SMCRA, the Secretary finds that Arkansas has, subject to the exceptions in Finding 1(b), 4(c), 4(h) and 4(p). the capability to carry out the provisions of SMCRA under the Arkansas Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act (ASCMRA) and to meet its purposes in the followiug ways: (a) The Arkansas Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act (ASCMRA) provides for the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on non-Indian and non-federal land in Arkansas in accordance with SMCRA. (b) The ASCMRA provides sanctions for violations of Arkansas laws. regulations or conditions of permits concerning surface coal mining and reclamation operations, and these sanctions meet the requirements of SMCRA. including civil and criminal actions, forfeiture of bonds, suspensions, revocations, withholding of permits, and the issuance of cessation orders by the Arkansas DPCE or its inspectors with the following excetion: A substantial difference in the p'fhalties exists between those provided in Section 704 of SMCRA and those provided in Arkansas Stat. Ann. 41-2801, 41-}01 and 41-110. Section 704 of SMCRA establishes a fine of not more than $5,000, or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both, for personsinterfering with government employees in the performance of duties pursuant to SMCRA. The Arkansas statutes provide for a maximum fine of $100 or $1,000 and a maximum imprisonment of 30 days or one year depending on whether force is used or threatened in the obstruction of governmental functions. The Secretary finds that this deficiency is minor because the history of state and coal industry relations in Arkansas indicates that state employees will not likely be either significantly deterred in performing their duties or subject to violence or harassment during the time this deficiency is being corrected. (c) The Arkansas DPCE has sufficienU administrative and technical personnel and sufficient funds to enable Arkansas to regulate surface coal mining and reclamation operations in accordance with the requirements of SMCRA. (d) The ASCMRA provides for the effective implementation. maintenance, and enforcement of a permit system that meets the requirements of SMCRA for the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on non- Indian and non-federal lands within Arkansas; (e) Arkansas has established a process for the designation of areas as unsuitable for surface coal mining in accordance with Section 522 of SMCRA. 30 U.S.C. 1272; (f) Arkansas has established, for the purpose of avoiding duplication, a process for coordinating the review and issuance of permits for surface coal mining and reclamation operations with other federal and state permit processes applicable to the proposed operation: (g) Arkansas has regulations consistent with regulations issued pursuant to SMCRA. as required by Section 503(a)(7) of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1253, subject to the exceptions discussed in findings 4(c). 4{h) and 4(p). 2. As required by Section SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1253(b)(1)-(3), and 30 CFR 732.11-732.13. the Secretary has. through OSM (a) Solicited and publicly disclosed the views of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the heads of other federal agencies concerned with or having special expertise pertinent to the proposed Arkansas program; (b) Obtained the written concurrence of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency with respect to those aspects of the Arkansas program being approved today that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Federal Clean Water Act as amended, (33 U.S.C. 1151-1175), and the Clean AirAct as amended. (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., and; (c) Held a public review meeting in Little Rock, Arkansas, on March 31. 1980. to discuss the completeness of the Arkansas program submission and subsequently held a public hearing in Fort Smith. Arkansas, on July 8,190o. on the substance of the program submission. 3. In accordance with Section 503 (b)t4) of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1253tb)t4). the Secretary finds that the State of Arkansas has the statutory authority and qualified personnel necessary for enforcement of the environmental protection standards of SMCRA and 30 CFR Chapter VIL (4) In accordance with 30 CFR 732.15, the Secretary finds, on the basis of information in the Arkansas program submission, including the section-by- section comparison of the Arkansas law with SMCRA, public comments, testimony and written presentations at the public meeting and hearing, and other relevant information. that- (a) The Arkansas program provides for Arkansas to carry out the provisions and meet the purposes of SMCRA and 30 CFR Chapter VII with the exceptions noted in findings 1(b), 4(c), 4(h) and 4(p). and that Arkansas has not proposed any alternative approaches to the requirements of 30 CFR Chapter VII pursuant to 30 CFR 731n13. This finding is made under 30 CFR 732.15{a]. (b) The Arkansas DPCE has the authority under its laws and regulations to implement, administer and enforce all applicable requirements consistent with 30 CFR Chapter VII. Subchapter K. and the Arkansas program includes provisions to do so. This finding is made under 30 CFR 732.15(b)(1). (c) The Arkansas DPCE has, except as noted below, the authority under Arkansas laws and regulations and the Arkansas program includes provisions to implement, administer and enforce a permit system consistent with 30 CFR Chapter VIL Subchapter G and to prohibit surface coal mining and reclamation operations that do not have a permit issued by the regulatory authority, except that in order to comply with 30 CFR 786.19(h), Arkansas must revise its regulation Section 786.19(h) to reference federal law rather than state law regarding proof of payment of all reclamation fees before permit approval. The failure of Arkansas regulation 786.19(h) to accurately require proof of payment of past due federal reclamation fees as a criterion for granting a permit is a minor problem because the language used is identical to 30 CFR 786.19(h), and, by letter of August 8,1980 (A.R. 170] the ADPCE's 77008 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations I chief counsel committed Arkansas to an interpretation of its Section 786.19(h) consistent with the interest of 30 CFR 786.19(h) until the rule can be formally amended. These provisions are contained in Parts 770-795 of the Arkansas regulations and in Section 13 of the ASCMRA. This finding is made under 30 CFR 732.15(b)(2). (d) The Arkansas DPCE has authority under Arkansas laws and regulations to regulate coal exploration consistent with 30 CFR Part 776 and 30 CFR Part 815 and to prohibit coal exploration that does not comply with 30 CFR Part 776 and Part 815. This finding is made under 30 CFR 732.15(b)(3). ,{e) The Arkansas DPCE has authority under Arkansas laws and regulations to require that persons extracting coal incidental to government-financed construction maintain information on- site consistent with 30 CFR Part 707. This finding is made under 30 CFR 732.15(b)(4). (f) The Arkansas DPCE has the authority under Arkansas laws and regulations to enter, inspect and monitor all coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation opeiations on non-Indian and non-federal lands-within. Arkansas consistent with Section 511 of SMCRA and 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter L. This finding is made under 30 CFR 732.15(b)(5). The Arkansas counterparts to the above provisions are contained in Sections 10, 16, and 17 of ASCMRA'and Subchapter L of Arkansas' regulations. (g) The Arkansas DPCE has the authority under Arkansas laws and regulations to implement, administer, and enforce a system for performance bonds and liability insurance, or other equivalent guarantees, consistent with 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter J. This finding is made under 30 CFR 732.15(b)(6). The above provisions are at Subchapter J, Parts 800-809 of the Arkansas regulations. (h) In accordance with 30 CFR 732.15(b)(7), the Secretary finds that the Arkansas DPCE has authority under thb ASCMRA and ADPCE's regulations to provide for civil and criminal sanctions for violations of the Arkansas law, regulations*and conditions of permits and exploration approvals including civil and criminal penalties in accordance with Section 518 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1268) and-consistent with 30' CFR Part 845 including the same or - similar procedural requirements, except as noted below. The provisions are contained in Sections 18, 19, 20, 21, 29, and 30 of the ASCMRA and Part 845 of the Arkansas regulations. The exception is that there is no constraint on.the length of time that willbe taken in the process of administrative adjudication of proposed civil penalties under Section 29 of ASCMRA and regulation Section 845.19. Although an operator seeking a hearing must make his request within 30 days of receiving the proposed assessment (Section 845.19(a)) and the hearing officer must render his decision within thirty days after holding a hearing (Section 29(1] of ASCMRA), there is no limit on the time in which a hearing must beheld. It is important to both operators-and the public that the adjudication process not be unreasonably delayed. Under the OSM assessment conference procedure (30 CFR 845.18) no more than 150 days will normally elapse between the initial proposal of a penalty and the conclusion of this first level of administrative review. At that time, an operator wishing further review must request a formal adjudicatory hearing and place the full amount of the proposed penalty in escrow. The escrow provision is required by Section 518(c) of SMCRA. Arkansas has chosen to omit an assessment conference procedure in favor of a formal administrative hearing as its first step in review of a proposed assessment. Because this hearing is sequentially similar to the OSM assessment conference, the Secretary agre6s that the escrow requirement can be deferred to the second level of review as it is under OSM procedure. In Arkansas the second level of review is judicial review, and Arkansas has a functional equivalent to the escrow requirement in the nature of a required penalty bond plus ten percentper annum interest that must be posted at' the time judicial review is requested (Section 30(b) of ASCMRA). The problem is that under its present provisions the second level of review may be unreasonably delayed. Therefore, the Secretary will require, as a condition of the approval announced today, that Arkansas, by regulation or policy commitment in an amendment to the program submission, place a reasonable limit on the amount of time a hearing officer may take to hold a hearing under Section \u00a7 45.19. after one is requested. 'The failure by Arkansas to place a limit on the time within which administrative hearings on proposed civil penalties must be held is a minor problem because Arkansas has agreed to promulgate such a limitation by January 1, 1981, which'will be accomplished before any unreasonable delay could possibly occur even if a civil penalty hearing were requested very early.in the permanent regulatory program.On August 14, 1980, Arkansas submitted a letter requesting that the Secretary approve the civil penalty point system described in Section 843.13 of the Arkansas regulations. (See Administrative Record No. AR-110). Because of this request, the Secretary does not have to affirmatively disapprove Arkansas' point system in accordance with the district court's August 15, 1980 order. The Secretary finds that the Arkansas point system is consistent with Section 518 of SMCRA and is therefore approved. (i) The Arkansas DPCE has the authority under Sections 22, 23, 24, and 25 of the ASCMRA and regulations to issue, modify, terminate and enforce notices of violation, cessation orders and show cause orders in accordance with Section 521 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1271) and with 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter L including the same or similar procedural requirements, This finding is made under 30 CFR 732.15(b)(8). These provisions are at Parts 842 and 843 of the Arkansas regulations. (j) The Arkansas DPCE has the statutory authority under the ASCMRA in Section 26 and regulations to provide for designation of areas as unsuitable for surface coal mining consistent with 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter F. This finding is made under 30 CFR 732.15(b)(9). The above provisions are contained in Parts 760-764 of the- Arkansas regulations. (k) The Arkansas DPCE has authority under the ASCMRA and regulations to provide for public participation in the development, revision and enforcement of Arkansas regulations and Its program consistent with the public participation requirements of SMCRA and 30 CFR Chapter VII. This finding is made under 30 CFR 732.15(b)(10). The Secretary further finds that the public has had a meaningful opportunity to participate In the development of the State's program submitted to OSM based on the information in the Administrative Record and the public hearings Arkansas held on the adoption of regulations pursuant to the ASCMRA on -April 30, 1979 in Fort Smith, Arkansas: on July 25, 1979 in Fort Smith, Arkansas; on July 26,1979, in Little Rock; Arkansas; on July 26,1979, in Camden, Arkansas; and on July 8,1980, in Fort Smith, Arkansas. (1) The Arkansas DA has authority under the ASCMRA and regulations, and the Arkansas program includes provisions to monitor, review, and enforce the prohibition against indirect or direct financial interests in coal mining operations by employees of the Arkansas DPCE consistent with 30 CFR Federal Regster / Vol. 45, No. 27 / Friday. November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations Part 705. This finding is made under 30 CFR 732.15(w)t11). The above provisions are contained in Part 705 of the Arkansas regulations. (in) The Arkansas DPCE has authority under the ASCMRA and regulations to require the training, examination, and certification of persons engaged in or responsible for blasting and the use of explosives in accordance with Section 719 of SMCRA. Arkasas has proposed regulations in Part 850 on training programs for blasters and members of blasting crews and c-tification programs for blasters. This finding is made under 30 CPR 72.15(b)(12). The Secretary inds that the State is not required to implement regulations governing such training. examination and certification unil six months after federal Begulations for these provisions have been promulgated. Federal regulations have not been promulgated as of this time. However, when OSM issues final rules on this subject, Arkansas will be required to have regulations consistent with them. (n) The Arkansas DPCE has authority under Section 5 of ASCMRA and regulations to operate a small operator assistance program consistent with 30 CFR Part 795. This finding is made under 30 CFR 732.15(b)(13). The Arkansas regulations on ibis subject are at Part 795. (o) The Arkansas DPCE does not have statutory provisions to protect its employees consistent with Section 704 of SMCRA. See finding 1(b). (p) The Arkansas DPCE has authority under Sections 30 and 31 of the ASCMRA and regulations to provide for administrative and judicial review of state program actions in accordance with Sections 525 and 526 of SMCRA and 30 CPR Chapter VIL Subchapter L with one exception. This finding is made under 30 CFR 732.15(b)(15). The exception is that Section 940.1(a](2), as presented to the public during the extended comment period, failed to list one of the three criteria for temporary administrative relief required by Section 525(c) of SMCRA. The requirement that temporary relief can be granted only after a hearing in the locality of the permit area in which all parties were given an opportunity to be heard, was in fact enacted by the Arkansas commission on July 25, 1980. but the program before the public did not reflect that rule. The letter of August 8,1980, to the Regional Director (AR 170) submitted the correct version otSection 940.1(a)(2) for the first time. Therefore, the Secretary finds that the program submitted for his review did not comply with Section 525(c)(1) of SMCRA. As a condition of the approvalgranted today, Arkansas will have to resubmit Section 940.1(a) of its regulations for further public comment and review by the Secretary. The failure of Arkansas rule 940.1(a) to include as a criterion for temporary relief in enforoement proceedings that a hearing be held In the locality of the permit area and that all parties be given an opportunity to be heard is a minor problem because temporary relief proceedings are not probable within the time it wil take to correct the rule and ADPCE's chief legal counsel has committed ADPCE to instructing its hearing officers not to grant or deny temporary relief without having had such a hearing. See telephone memo of September 25,1980 (Administrative Record No. AK-19g). (q) In accordance with 30 CFR 732.15(bXS1). the Secretary finds that the Arkansas DPCE has authority under Arkansas laws and the Arkansas program contains provisions to cooperate and coordinate with and provide documents and other information to the Office of Surface Mining under the provisions of 30 CFR Chapter VIL This authority is contained in Section 5(b) of ASCMRA. (r) In accordance with 30 CFR 732.15(c), the Secretary finds that the ASCMRA and the ADPCEs regulations and the other laws and regulations of Arkansas do not contain provisions that would interfere with or preclude implementation of the provisions of SMCRA and 30 CFR Chapter VIL See Response to Comments, No. 19. (s) In accordance with 30 CFR 732.15(d), the Secretary rinds that the Arkansas DPCE and other state agencies having a role in the program have sufficient legal, technical and administrative personnel and suffi'cient funding to implement, administer and enforce the provisions of the program. the requirements of 30 CFR 732.15(b), and other applicable slate and federal laws. Disposition of Comments 1. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) noted that Arkansas has adopted the language of the Secretary's regulation in Section 816.92(b) of its regulations, allowing drainage diversions to be designed to the 100-year, 24-hour precipitation event while MSHA guidelines recommend design to a 100-year, 6-hour precipitation event. The Secretary will not require the State to adopt the MSHA guideline. Since the State's regulation is in compliance with 30 CFR 816.92(b), which is more stringent than the MSHA recommendation and since the Secretary of Labor concurred in theadoption of that rule, adoption of the recommended change is not required. 2. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) recommended that Arkansas be made aware of the existing Bureau of Land Management (BLM), USGS, and Office of Surface Mining (OSM) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the management of Federal coal Arkansas has been provided a copy of the joint MOU. 3. The USGS recommended that Arkansas include in its program procedures for processing proposed mine plans or permits that include Federal lands. Such processing procedures need not be included in the state plan because: (1) in States without a cooperative agreement with the Department of the Interior, the Secretary has sole responsibility for review and approval of permit applications on Federal lands, and (2) in States with a cooperative agreement. the Secretary has joint responsibility with the state. Arkansas' procedures for processing mine plans or permits would be identified in the cooperative agreement if the State chooses to execute such an agreement. Therefore, no change is required. 4. The USGS recommended that Arkansas be apprised of exploration requirements on Federal lands and that a reference to those requirements be included in the permanent program. Exploration responsibilities are explained in the BLM, USGS, and OSM Memorandum of Understanding provided to Arkansas. They do not need to be restated in the program submission because Arkansas will have no jurisdiction on Federal lands unless a cooperative agreement is approved by the Secretary. Therefore, no change is required. 5. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) requested involvement in all pre- application conferences where there are known or potential conflicts with FWS statutory responsibilities. The Secretary believes that Section 786.10(c)(4) of the Arkansas rules adequately provides for FWS involvement in pre-application conferences. (See also Sections 73114(g) (1), (9), and (10) of Arkansas' program narrative.] The FWS and other Federal agencies have additional opportunity to comment on proposed operations once an application is filed under Sections 786.12 and 786.13. 6. The FWS recommended modifications to several forms Arkansas included in the narrative of its program. The modifications were forwarded to Arkansas for consideration; however, the Secretary is not basing his decision on any forms submitted as part of the State program package. Forms will be77W09 77010 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations discussed with the State as part of the Secretar,'s monitoring function. 7. The FWS suggested that Section 731.14(g)(3) of the program narrative be modified to include a provision-for notifying the FWS of bond releases on areas for which the FWS has statutory responsibilities. The FWS also requested it be invited to participate in the inspection and evaluation of the reclamation work. The Secretary believes that the program narrative complies with the Federal regulations and contains adequate provisions for Federal agencies to be informed of, and to participate in, bond release proceedings. Furthermore, in the circumstance envisioned, FWS would get direct notice under the provisions of Section 807.11 (a) and (d) of the ADPCE regulationS. 8. The FWS requested that Section 731.14(g)(4) of the program narrative be revised to include procedures for handling inspection requests from the FWS and other Federal agencies. Neither SMCRA nor the regulations adopted thereunder require that the \" regulatory authority conduct inspections at the request of Federal agencies \"other than OSM. The Secretary assumes that if information provided to Arkansas by a Federal agency other than OSM alleges a violation, Arkansas will conduct an inspection, on the same basis as it would for any citizen making such an allegation. If a Federal agency is not satisfied with the Stdte's response, it can inform the Secretary, who can initiate an inspection under Section 521(a)(1) of SMCRA; therefore, no change is required. 9. The FWS and the National Park Service requested that Sectiorn 731.14(g)(10) of the program narrative be revised to include language providing for the notification of a permit application to all Federal agencies having statutory responsibilities. The Secretary agreed with this comment and OSM advised the State to revise Section 786.11(c) of the proposed regulations to require the Arkansas DPCE to notify Federal agencies having jurisdiction over or an interest in the area of the proposed operations. The program amendments received on July 2, 1980, revised Section 786.11(c) accordingly. The Secretary believes that the revisions to Section 786.11(c) now fully enacted, make revising the narrative unnecessary because because the regulations have the force of law and are binding on the ADPCE. 10. The FWS recommended that a formal agreement be developed to specify coordination and consultation responsibilities between the Arkansas DPCE and the Arkansas Game and FishCommission. The FWS Is concerned that it may be impracticable for the Game and Fish Commission to respond satisfactorily to demands from the surface mining program for certain services. Arkansas Stat. Ann. 82-1903(c) requires other agencies to assist the Arkansas DPCE only when assistance is\"practicable.\" The'Secretary agrees that if the Arkansas DPCE intends to rely upon assistance from other agencies, formal agreements would be 'appropriate. However, with the possible exception of assistancewith the blaster certification program, Arkansas does not plan to rely on assistance from other agencies for the adminittration of its program. The Secretary cannot require formal agreements unless other state agencies have been identified as having mandatory duties in the state program. 11. The FWS, in its biological opinion pursuant to Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, found the Arkansas surface mining program, as proposed, unlikely to jeopardize the continued existence of endangered or threatened species, or result in adverse modification or the destruction of critical habitats. In additibn to the non-jeopardy opinion, the FWS also commented on the - following concerns: (1) the need for revising 30 CFR Chapter VII to provide for consultation between federal agencies pertinent to the protection of species proposed for listing and/or, being proposed for critical habitat, (2) a current inability to assess FWS manpower requirements for its participation in the permit reviewing process, and (3) the direction to be taken by OSM to comply with the requirements of 30 CFR Part 733, \"Maintenance of State Programs and Prdcedures for Substituting Federal Enforcement of State Programs and Withdrawing Approval of State Programs.\" The Secretary finds that while these concerns are-important, and has taken them under advisement, they are not comments on whether the Arkansas program complies with the existing standards for the Secretary's approval of state programs. Therefore, they require no response in this rulemaking. 12. The FWS suggested that Arkansas be required to reword Section 786.11 of the proposed state regulations, as amended, to delete the reference to Section 783.ZO. The FWS contended that Arkansas Section 783.20 is analogous to 30 CFR 779.20 which was remanded by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and which, therefore, would have to be disapbroved by the Secretary (See court opinion, February 26, 1980, pp. 38-39). The FWS suggested thatdeletion of the reference to Arkansas Section 783.20 would avoid a possible reference to a disapproved rule. While this comment may have merit, the Secretary is not requiring states to delete references to suspended or remanded regulations. The decision to make such revisions will be left to the State's discretion. 13. The National Park Service (NPS) requested that Sections 731.14(g)(9) and (10) of the program narrative be revised to include a procedure for the Arkansas DPCE to notify the appropriate NPS regional director before a decision Is made to approve or deny exploration or mining and reclamation permits in areas that may have the potential to affect the resources of national park units in Arkansas. The Secretary's regulations do not require notice of exploration operations that will remove less than 250 tons of coal. However, 30 CFR 776.12(b) requires a general public notice of exploration proposals that would remove more than 250 tons, and any person with an interest that might be adversely affected, including the NPS, is free to comment. Therefore, while the Secretary urges Arkansas to cooperate -with the NPS by directly notifying It of exploration activities near NPS jurisdictional units, he will not require the Arkansas DPCE to'do so under the federal regulations. 14. The NPS requested the opportunity to (1) be involved in setting bond amounts for surface mining and reclamation activities that may have an impact on NPS units, (2) be allowed to participate in inspections prior to the release of those bonds, and (3) be allowed to participate in inspections conducted in response to a petition or notice of violation that may affect an NPS unit. The Secretary believes that Arkansas' regulations are consistent with 30 CFR 780.18(b)(2), 800.13 and 805.11 and with Section 509 of SMCRA concerning the determination of the performance bond amount. The NPS and otherfederal agencies, like private citizens, have the right to comment on proposed mining operations including the proper amount of bond. (See Arkansas Sections 786.12, 786.13, and 786.14.) Under the Secretary's regulation's in 30 CFR Parts 805 and 800, which have been adopted by Arkansas, the State will have\" authority to set the terms and amounts of the performance bond on non-federal and non-Indian lands. Federal agencies also have an opportunity to comment on proposed bond releases for areas for which they may have a concern under Part 807 of the Arkansas regulations. However, OSM advised the Arkansas DPCE to Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations amend proposed Section 807.11 to clarify the rights of those who object to bond releases (See letter of April 18, 1980, Administrative Record No. AK-92). Program revisions received May 30 and July 2,1980, have revised Part 807 to accommodate NPS's concerns about bond releases. 15. The NPS requested the opportunity to participate in developing criteria for designating lands unsuitable for surface coal mining near NPS units and to be allowed to participate in the protection of all iesources on lands under its jurisdiction from mining in adjacent areas. Arkansas' regulation Section, 762.11 identifying the criteria for developing lands as unsuitable, is consistent with 30 CFR 762.11. The petition process included in Arkansas' regulation 764.13 would provide the opportunity for any person having an interest that is or may be adversely affected to petition to have an area designated as unsuitable for mining. This approach provides the NPS with the opportunity it seeks to protect lands in the National Park System. The Secretary has instructed the Park Service not to seek criteria in State programs which would establish \"buffer zones\" adjacent to National parks as automatically unsuitable for coal mining, unless these lands meet one or more of the other specific criteria for designation. On June 4,1979, the Secretary made final decisions on the Federal Coal Mangement Program. Included in those decisions were numerous changes in the proposed unsuitability criteria for federal lands. The Secretary chose to delete the automatic \"buffer zone\" language for national parks and certain other federal lands from the first criterion (43 CFR 3461.1(a)]. Instead, he stated lands adjacent to a national park should only be found unsuitable if they are covered by one of the other specific criteria (43 CFR 3461.1(b)-(t)). This instruction to the Park Service assures that that Agency's approach to State unsuitability criteria will be compatible with the Secretary's policy on federal unsuitability criteria. 16. The NPS and the Bureau of Mines commented that the Arkansas regulations did not include a section comparable to 30 CFR Part 740-General Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations on Federal Lands. 30 CFR Part 740 provides rules for OSM to administer a federal lands program for federal lands, and does not directly apply to a state. Section 5(c)(15) of the Arkansas Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act of 1979 contains authority for the State to enter into acooperative agreement with the Secretary enabling the State to regulate surface coal mining on federal lands. Arkansas has not enacted regulations for a federal lands cooperative agreement because it does not anticipate that surface mining operations will be conducted on federal lands within Arkansas in the near future. 17. The NPS commented that the environmental information should be consolidated into a special section of the final program document emphasizing Arkansas' environmental requirements and documentation procedures. The Secretary's regulations do not require this revision. Therefore, no change is necessary. 18. The NPS noted that the applicable air quality portions of the Arkansas Water and Air Pollution Control Act should be included in the program. The air quality portion of the Arkansas Water and Air Pollution Control Act is included in Section 731.14(b) of the program narrative. 19. The Bureau of Mines (BOM) commented that Sections 52-612 and 52-625 of the Arkansas statutes are discriminatory and in violation of federal law. Section 52-612 prohibits females from working in coal mines and Section 52-625 requires separate bath houses for blacks and whites. The Secretary agrees that such laws probably violate the federal constitution. On August 14, 1980, OSM received an opinion of the chief legal counsel of the ADPCE explaining that Section 52-625 of the Arkansas statutes was repealed by 1973 Arkansas Acts No. 253 Section 5, and that Arkansas Section 52-612 is unconstitutional (see Administrative Record Document No. AK-170). The Secretary believes that the opinion received from Arkansas satisfactorily resolves these issues and that no change is necessary to the proposed program. Even if Section 52-612 were enforced, it would not directly interfere with the implementation of SMCRA. Although it was submitted with other laws in the program package to comply with 30 CFR 731.14(b), the Secretary believes that it is not a law \"directly affecting the regulation of coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations\" and that it is not part of the program upon which today's decision is based. 20. The BOM requested clarification of a time schedule of permit reviews as shown on a flowchart on page 204 of Volume 1. The Secretary finds that the review process will require a minimum of 90 dais and a maximum of 270 days, based on the regulations in Part 786. TheSecretary's decision today is not based on the accuracy of the diagram on p. 204 of the program narrative. 21. The BOM and the Department of Energy commented that Section 731.14(g) (13) of the program narrative pertaining to the content of the proposed training criteria for use in training, examining, and certifying blasters was incomplete. These comments pertain to a part of the Arkansas program that is not required until six months after the federal regulations on training, examining, and certifying blasters are promulgated. The federal regulations have not yet been promulgated (See 30 CFR 732.15(b)(12)). The narrative provided by the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology is used only as a guideline for inspectors and course development and does not impose training or safety requirements on operators. Upon adoption of federal regulations Arkansas will be required to adopt regulations consistent with those regulations. 22. The BOM expressed concern that there is no requirement to allow exploration or underground mines in Arkansas. Arkansas' proposed regulations governing such activities have been included in the program submission at Parts 782-784 for underground mining and Part 776 for exploration activities. The Secretary finds that those regulations comply with SMCRA and 30 CFR Chapter VII 23. The BOM made several comments on the statistical information presented in Section 731.14(h) of the program narrative, specifically information related to projections and trends in mining production and a possible discrepancy in tonnage when compared to past mining production. Inasmuch as the tonnage identified in Section 731.14(h)(8) is a projection only, the Secretary is satisfied that the statistical information as presented is adequate to meet the requirements of 30 CFR 731.14(h). 24. The BOM commented that Arkansas did not include regulations equivalent to 30 CFR 760.3, 760.4, 764.11, 765 and 769. The Secretary has determined that state programs do not need provisions comparable to 30 CFR parts 760, 765 and 769 because these parts are not applicable to a state program submission. 30 CFR 764.11 requires a state to establish a process for designating lands unsuitable for mining. Arkansas' regulations Part 764 establish such a process, which is further described in Section 731.14[g)(11) of the program narrative. 25. The BOM commented that Arkansas did not include regulations comparable to 30 CFR 810.3,820, 822 and77011 77012 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations 825, and that Arkansas combined 30 CFR Parts 816 and 817 of the federal rules into Part 816 of its rules and added Sections 816.121, 816.122, 816.124, and 816,126 addressing underground mining. The Secretary finds that the Arkansas program does not need to include regulations equivalent to 30 CFR 810.3. .820, 822 and 825, because 30 CFR 810.3 applies to the Secretary and 30 CFR. Parts 820, 822 and 825 cover special performance standards not necessary in Arkansas (anthracite mines in Pennsylvania, alluvial valley floors west of the 100th meridian and special bituminous coal mines in Wyoming, respectively). The Sectetary finds that in its regulations, Arkansas has acceptably combined those regulations that apply to 'both surface and underground mining. It was, however, necessary to add Sections 816.121-816.126 to cover standards unique to underground mining. Therefore, no changes are necessary. 26. The BOM commented that Section 816,74 refers to a safety factor of 1.1 for earthquake conditions and uggested that the factor may be low forfill embankments. The Secretary finds the 'Arkansas regulation is equivalent to 30 CFR 816.74 and the Statecannot be required to adopt a more stringent regulation. 27. The BOM noted that the Arkansas Statute (ASCMRA) does not have provisions comparable to Sections 502(e), Secretary finds that Arkansas is not required to include - provisions equivalent to those Sections of SMCPA for the following reasons: (1) Section 502(e) provides the authority for a federal enforcement program during the interim period, not a permanent program which is the subject here; (2) Section 502(f) addresses the interim period between the disapproval of a state program and the implementation of a federal program or a federal lands program and is inapplicable once a state program is approved; (3) Section 503 describes the submission of state programs, an activity which occurs at the federal level only; (4) Section 504 provides the authority for implementing a federal program which applies only to the Secretary; (5) Section 505 prohibits state laws or regulations that are inconsistent with the provisions of SMCRA or regulations issued pursuant thereto; that law will be implemented by the Secretary's decision today; (6) the provisions of Sections 507(b)(7)-(17) and507(c)-g) are adequately covered by of Section 508(a)(6)-(14) and 508(b) concerning, reclamation plan requirements are covered by regulations Sections 779.22, applicable only to areas' west of the 100th meridian west longitude, whereas Arkansas is east of the 100th meridian; (9) Sections 510(c) and 510(d) are covered by Section 28 of the Arkansas Act; (10) the Secretary finds that it is not necessary for the Arkansas statute to have provisions comparable to the omitted portions of Section 515 of SMCRA as long as the performance standarids are covered by enforceable regulations promulgated pursuant to general statutory authority; (11) similarly, the provisions of Section 516 are covered by Arkansas' regulations Part 816; and (12) the Secretary finds that Arkansas does not need a provision comparable to Section 529 because it did not have a law in existence prior to August 3,1977, that established environmental protection standards for anthracite surface coal mining. 28. The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP] sought additional .information to determine the extent that Arkansas' proposed regulatory program is in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA): The information requested concerns the requirement of NHPA for written comments from the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and an independent determination by OSM's regional director as to the likelihood that the state program will adversely affect properties included, or eligible for inclusion, on the National Register of Historic Places. The Secretary believes that the proposed. Programmatic Memorandum of Agreement between OSM and ACHP (See 45 FR 41988, June 23, 1980) when signed and implemented will satisfy compliance with Section 106 of NHPA. 29. The ACHP and the Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service (HCRS) expressed concern that historic, archaeological, and other cultural resources could be destroyed or lost unless steps in the permitting process are taken to ensure adequately the identification of such resources, The Secretary believes that the Arkansas rules provide all the consideration of historic, archaeological and other cultural resources currently required by the federal rules in 30 CFR Chapter VII,30. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) suggested that surface mining control programs, including the Arkansas program, should require all mines to quantify all emissions, including fugitive dust particulates, that are associated with their operations and to make the information readily accessible for input into Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) air quality models. To avoid conflict with the Clean Air Act program for prevention of significant deterioration and protection of non-attainment areas, the Secretary has decided not to require separate demonstrations of compliance with those clean air programs beyond the requirements of Sections 508(a)(9) and 515(b)(4) of SMCRA. Arkansas' proposed regulations were not originally consistent with 30 CFR 780.15 because the fugitive dust control plan was not made mandatory. That problem has been corrected under the revisions received from theArkansas DPCE on May 30,1980. The regulations, now fully enacted, are also consistent with 30 CFR 816.95, but Section 816.95 must be affirmatively disapproved to the extent indicated below under \"Arkansas Regulations That Must Be Disapproved\" to comply with the May 16, 1980, opinion of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (pp. 27-29). 31. The EPA commented on the lack of enforceable conditions in the sample permit in Section 731.14(g)(1) of the program narrative to ensure that the conditions of the permit are met, particularly with respect to the control of discharge to surface waters. The comment was forwarded to Arkansas for consideration. However, the Secretary is not basing any part of his approval decision on forms submitted with a state program document. Forms will be discussed with Arkansas as part of the Secretary's monitoring function during the permanent program. 32. The EPA and the Department of Energy commented that the narrative description of the means of administering and enforcing the permanent program performance standards required by 30 CFR 731.14(g)(6) had been omitted. Arkansas addresses the various aspects of administering and enforcing the permanent program performance standards in Sections 731.14(g)(1), 731.14(g)(4), and 731.14(g)(5) of the program narrative. The Secretary has determined that inclusion of the same material in Section 731.14(g)(6) is not necessary. 33. The EPA and the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) suggested that in developing criteria for Federal Register / Vol. 46, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations designating lands unsuitable for surface mining, consideration be given to the President's Executive Orders 11900 (Wetland Protection) and 11988 (Flood Plain Management). Arkansas' regulation Section 762.11(b)(2), which is consistent with 30 CFR 762.11(b)(2). states that upon petition an area may be designated as unsuitable for certain types of surface coal mining operations if the operation will affect fragile lands and could result in significant damage to important natural systems. The Secretary believes the State is not obligated to comply with E.O. 11900 and 11988, but encourages Arkansas and other states to consider applying the criteria of those orders when reviewing operations that may affect wetlands or floodplains. 34. The EPA commented that the Arkansas scheme for determining the amount of the civil penalty to be assessed would potentially result in more lenient penalties than the federal regulations. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in its decision of February 26, 1980, and in its subsequent clarification of May 26,1980, found that the Secretary may not require the state to impose penalties as stringent as those in 30 CFR 845.15. Therefore, the Secretary cannot require changes to the Arkansas civil penalty system as long as the state scheme uses the four criteria in Section 518(a) of SMCRA. The Arkansas regulations use those criteria. 35. The Department of Energy (DOE) commented that the cost of reviewing permit applications should be specifically addressed in the submission. Arkansas' regulation Section 771.25 requires a $500 fee for a permit review. Section 507(a) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 771.25 require a permit review fee that can be less than, but may not exceed, the actual cost of reviewing a permit application. The Secretary finds that a $500 fee will be less than the actual cost for adequately reviewing a permit. Therefore, no change is required. 36. The DOE commented that Section 731.14(g)(11) of the program narrative concerning the designation of lands as unsuitable for mining should be addressed in more detail. The Secretary believes tiat the program narrative, although brief, is sufficient to comply with 30 CFR 731.14(g)(11). 37. The DOE commented that the submission should make explicit the penalties associated with the willful violation of the conflict of interest provision. The Secretary finds that specific criminal penalties are authorized under Section 17(a) of the Arkansas Act and that specificregulatory penalties are imposed under authority of Section 705.6(b) of Arkansas' regulations. 38. The DOE commented on Section 731.14(h)(8) of the program narrative regarding the absence in the coal production data of a distinction between surface and underground mining activities. Arkansas projects in Section 731.14(h)(8) of its program narrative that, unless there is an increase in underground operations, the trend of surface mining activities, as currently established, will hold true for some time into the future. Arkansas does provide a map, referenced in Section 731.14(h)(8) and found at 731.14(h){4) of the program narrative, that identifies existing surface and underground mining activities. The Secretary believes that the information contained in the narrative is sufficient and does not require change. 39. The DOE commented on Sections 731.14 (i) and (j) of the program narrative pertaining to staffing requirements. The commenter suggested that a biologist, ecologist, hydrologist. and a wildlife management specialist be added to the staff and that the State explain how calculations determining adequate staffing and allocation of staff time were made. In revisions to the program submitted May 30,1980, the Department of Pollution Control and Ecology revised Section 731.140) of the program narrative to demonstrate that the Arkansas DPCE will have adequate staff to administer the program, including the staff identified by the commeter. 40. The DOE commented on Section 731.14(1) of the program narrative relative to the budget. The commenter felt that the information submitted did not adequately explain the cost of administering the permanent program, not did it include sufficient fiscal information relating to the Department of Pollution Control and Ecology. On May 30,1980, the Department of Pollution Control and Ecology revised this part of the program narrative and submitted new budget information. The Secretary believes that the budget information submitted is consistent with the requirement of 30 CFR 731.14(1). 41. The DOE commented on Section 731.14(m) of the program narrative regarding physical reources, suggesting that additional detail be incorporated into the section. On May 30,1980, the Department of Pollution Control and Ecology submitted revisions to this part of the program narrative including additional information pertinent to physical resources. The Secretary believes that the physical resources information is consistent with the requirement of 30 CFR 731.14(m).42. The Soil Conservation Service (SCS} suggested that Arkansas provide other government agencies the opportunity to review notices of intent to explore on Federal lands in the same manner as permit applications are reviewed. The commenter stated that the Forest Service would need this information before permits could be issued on national Forest lands. Arkansas has not made provisions for a Federal lands cooperative agreement in its permanent program submission because It does not anticipate that surface mining operations will be conducted on Federal lands within Arkansas in the near future, and thus will not be processing notices to explore within the boundaries of a national forest. Arkansas does have authority under its Act to administer a Federal lands program in the State if such a program becomes necessary in the future. Therefore, no change is required. 43. The SCS suggested the addition of designated wilderness areas to either Section 779.24(i) or Section 779.24(k) of Arkansas' proposed regulations. The additions would require that maps included with permit applications Identify wilderness areas. Arkansas' regulations 779.24(i) and 779.24(k), are consistent with 30 CFR 779.24 (i) and (k) and the Secretary cannot require the State to adopt additional criteria. 44. The SCS suggested additional language be added to Arkansas' proposed regulation Section 780.15 to require an air quality monitoring program if the map required under proposed Section 779.24(k) shows an area with Class I air quality. Such a regulation is not mandatory for States east of the 100th meridian, such as Arkansas, under 30 CFR 780.15. If there is a need for more specific air quality data, the Director of the DPCE can require It under Section 779.18. Therefore, no change is required. 45. The SCS suggested that Arkansas' proposed regulation Section 780.18(b](5) be revised to require measures, such as fencing, be taken to protect newly revegetated areas. The Secretary believes that Sections 816.111 through 816.117 would provide adequate controls to assure the prompt establishment of an effective and permanent vegetation cover. A permittee is not relieved of the responsibility to use whatever methods are necessary, including fencing, to achieve successful revegetation of the disturbed area. 46. The SCS suggested that the Forest Service will need to review and approve a completed application before it can issue a special use permit for surface use on national forest laud. Arkansas has not made provisions for a Federal77013 77014 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations lands cooperative agreement in its Program submission. Therefore Arkansas will not be processing any applications for surface coal mining on Federal land within a pationalforest\" boundary. See response to comment number 42 above. 47. The SCS suggested that Arkansas should add requirements to give detailed descriptions of post mining use or obliteration of transportation facilities. Arkansas' regulations Sections 816.156, .166, and .176 track the language of 30 CFR 816.156, .166, and .176. Therefore, Arkansas' rules are conkistent with the Secretary's regulations. 48. The SCS felt that Class I road grade in excess of eight percent will result in excessive erosion and surface stability problems unless the road surface and ditches are paved. Arkansas' regulation Section 816.152(a) is consistent with the Secretary's regulations. It should be noted, however, that as a result of the district court's May 16,1980 decision, 30 CFR 816.152 has been remanded. The parallel Arkansas regulation will have to be affirmatively disapproved. 46. The SCS proposed amending 30 CFR Chapter VII to include a new Section 30 CFR 780.28 entitled \"Reclamation Plan: Reclamation- Research and Demonstration of Reclamation Technology.\" The.Director of OSM could consider the proposed rule change if it is submitted-pursuant to 30 CFR 700.12. No change is required now, nor does this comment affect the Secretary's decision on the Arkansas program at this time. Background on Conditional Approval The Secretary is fully committed to two key aims which underlie SMCRA. The Act calls for comprehensive regulation of the effects of surface coal mining on the environment and public health and safety and for the secretary to assist the States in becoming the primary regulators under the Act. To enable the States to acheive that primacy, the Secretary has undertaken many activities of which several are particularly noteworthy. The Secretary has worked closely with several State organizations such as the Interstate Mining Compact Commission, the Council of State Governments, the National Governors association and the western Interstate Energy Board. Through these grofips OSM has frequently met with State regulatory authdrity personnel to discuss informally how the Act should be administered, with particular reference to unique-circumstances in individual States. Often these meetings have been a way for OSM and theStates to test new ideas and for OSM to explain portions of the Federal requirements and how the States might meet them. Alternative State regulatory options, the \"State window\" concept, for example, were discussed at several meetings of the Interstate Mining Compact Commission and the National Governors Association. The Secretary has dispensed over $6.9 million in program development grants and over $37.6 million in initial program grants to help the States to develop their programs, to administer their initial programseto train their personnel in the, new requirements, and to purchase new equipment. In several instances OSM detailed its personnel to States to assist in the preparation of their permanent program submissions. OSM has also met with individual States to determine how best to meet the Act's environmental protection goals. Equally important, the Secretary structured the state program approval procesi to assist the states in achieving primacy. He voluntarily provided his preliminary views on the adequacy of eich state program to identify needed changes and to allow them to be made without penalty to the state. The Secretaiy adopted a special policy to insure that communication between him and the states remained open and uninhibited at all times. This policy was critical to avoiding a period of enforced silence with a state after the close of the public commentperiod on its program, and has been a vital part of the program' review process (see 44 FR 54444, September 19,1979). The Secretary has also developed in' his regulations the critical ability to approve conditionally a state program. Under the Secretary's regulations, conditional approval gives fullprimacy to a state even though there are minor deficiencies in a program. This power is not expressly authorized by the Act; it was adopted through the Secretary's rulemaking authority under 30 U.S.C. 201(c), 502(b), and 503(a)(7). The Act expressly gives the Secretary only two options-to approve or disapprove a state program. Read literally, the Secretary would have no flexibility; he would have to approve those programs that are letter-perfect and disapprove all others.To avoid that result and in recognition of the difficulty of developing an acceptable program, the Secretary adopted the regulation providing the authority to approve conditionally a program. Conditional approval has a vital effect for programs approved in the Secretary's initial decision: it results in the implementation of the permanent program in a state months earlier thanmight otherwise be anticipated, While this may not be significant in states that already have comprehensive surface coal mining regulatory programs, In many states that earlier implementation will initiate a much higher degree of environmental protection. It also implements the rights SMCRA provides to citizens to participate in the regulation of surface coal mining through soliciting their views at hearings and meetings and enabling them to file requests to designate lands as unsuitable for mining if they are fragile, historic, critical to agriculture, or simply cannot be reclaimed to their prior productive capability. The Secretary considers three factors in deciding whether a program qualifies for conditional approval. First Is the state's willingness to make good faith efforts to effect the necessary changes. Without the state's commitment, the option of conditional approval may not be used. Second, no part of the program can be incomplete. As the preamble to the regulations says, the program, even with deficiencies, must \"provide for implementation and administration for all processes, procedures, and systems required by the Act and these regulations\" (44 FR 14961). That is, a state must be able to operate the basic components of the permanent program: the designation process; the permit and coal exploration systems; the bond and insurance requirements; the performance standards; and the inspection and enforcement systems. In addition there must be a functional regulatory authority to implement the other parts of the program. If some fundamental component is missing, conditional approval may not be used. Third, the deficiencies must be minor. For each deficiency or group of deficiencies, the Secretary considers the significance of the deficiency In light of the particular state in question. Examples of deficiencies that would be minor in virtually all circumstances are correction of clerical errors and resolution of ambiguities through attorney general's opinions, revised regulations, policy sthtements, changes in the narrative or the side-by-side. Other deficiencies require individual consideration. An example of a deficiency that would most likely be major would be a failure to allow meaningful public participation in the permitting process. Although this would not render the permit system incomplete because permits could still be issued, the lack of any public participation could be such a departure from a fundamental purpose of the Act that the deficiency would most likely be major.

Acoudingly. the Secretary is conditionally approving the Arkansas program. lif approval shall terminate if regulations or policy commitments correcting dfciencies .3 and 4 are not enacted and submitted by January 1. 1981 and if state legislation correcting deficiency number 1 is not enacted and submitted by April 15, 1981. This conditional approval is effective November 21,1980. Beginning on that date. the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology sall be deemed the regulatory audmrity in Arkansas and all Arkansas surface coal mining and reclamation operations on non-federal lands and all coal exploration o non-federal lands in Arkansas shall be subject to the permanent regulatory proam. On now -ederal lands in Arkansas, the permanent elplt'ry program consists of the sAte program conditionally approved by the Secretary. On federal lands, the permanent regulatory program consists of the federal rules made applicable under 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter D, Parts 740--745. Arkanas and the Department of Interior wAy enter into a cooperative agreement to apply the requirements of the approved Arkansas permanent regulatory program to federal lands under 30 CPR Pit 745. The Secretary's approval of the Arkansas program relates at this time only to the permanent regulatory program under Title V of SMCRA. Te a a does not constitute approval of my provisions related to implementation of Tile IV under SMCRA. the abandoned mine lands reclamation program. In accxordanoe with 30 CFR Part 884, Arkansas may submit a State Reclamation Plan now that its permanent program has been conditionflty approved. At the time of such a subnfsion, all provisions relating to abandoned mined lands reclamation will be reviewed by officials of the Department of the Interior.

The initial program became effective on February 3,1978, for new coal miirdng operations on non-federal and non-Indian lands that received sate permits on or after that date, and on May 3,1978, for all coal mines existing on that date. The initial program rules were promulgated by the Secretary on December 13,1977, under 30 CFR Parts 710-725 and 795,42 FR 62839, et seq. The permanent program will become effective in each state upon the approval of a state program by the Secretary of the Interior or implementation of a federal program within the state. If a state program is approved, the state, rather than the federal government, will be the primary regulator of activities subject to SMCRA. The federal regulations for the permanent program. including procedures for states to follow in submitting state programs and minimum standards and procedures the state programs must include to beeliible for approval, are found in 30 CFR Parts 7O0-M and 730-865. Part 705 was published October 20,1977 (4 FR 5806M), and Parts 795 and W6 (originally Part 830) were published December 13, 1977 (42 FR 58239). The other permanent program regulations were published March 13, 17 (44 FR 15312-15463). Errata notices were published 28001), June and July 15, 1980 (45 FR 474Z4). Amendments to the regulations were published October 22, 1971 (44 FR 80M89) and September 4. 190 (45 FR 58780-58786), as corrected December 19,1979 (44 FR 75143), 44 FR 75302-75303), FR 77440-77447), January 11, FR 2826-2829), April 15, 1980 (45 FR 2599-200).

See 44 FR 67942 (November 27, 1979 44 FR 77447-77454 (December 31, 199), 45 FR 8913 (January 30 1980), and 45 FR 51547-51550 (August 4.1980). General Background on State Program Approval Process Any state wishing to assume primary jurisdiction for the regulation of coal mining under SMCRA may submit a program for consideration. The Secretary of the Interior has the responsibility to approve or disapprove the submission. The federal regulations governing state program submissions are found at 30 CFR Parts 730-732. After review of the submission by OSM and other agencies, an opportunity for the state to make additions or modifications to the program. and an opportunity for public comment, the Secretary may either approve the program unconditionally; approve it conditioned upon minor deficiencies being corrected in accordance with a specified timetable; or disapprove the program in whole or in part. If any part of the program is disapproved, the state may submit revisions to correct the items that need change to meet the requirements of SMCRA and the applicable federal regulations. If the revised program is also diasapproved, SMCRA requires the Secretary of the Interior to establish a federal program in that state. The state may again request approval to assume primary jurisdiction after the federal program has been implemented. The procedure and timetable for the Secretary's review of state programs7701.7 77018 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations was initially published March 13,1979 (44 FR 15326J, to be codified at 30 CFR Part 732. As a resultof litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the deadline for states to submit proposed programs was extended from August 3, 1979, to March 3, 1980. Section 30 CFR 732.11(d)'required that if all required and fully enacted laws and regulations were not part of the program by November 15, 1979, the program would be disapproved. Because the submission deadline had been changed to March 3, 1980, 30 CFR 732.11(d) was amended to provide that program submissions that do not contain all required and fully enacted laws and regulations by the 104th day following program submission will be disapproved pursuant to the procedures for the , Secretary's initial decision in Section 732.13 (45 FR 33927, May 20, 1980). The Missouri program was submitted to OSM on February 1,1980. The 104th day after February 1 was May 15,1980. The Secretary's rules for the review of state programs implement his policy that industry, the public, and other agencies of government should-have a meaningful opportunity'to participate in his decisions. The Secretary also has a policy that a state should be afforded the maximum opportunity possible to change its program, when necessary, to cure any deficiencies in it. To accomplish both of these policy objectives the Secretary determined that the laws and rules upon which the state bases its program must be finalized at the beginning of the public comment period. By identifying the laws and rules in effect on the 104th day as the basis of his program approval decision, the Secretary assists commenters by informing them of program elements which should be reviewed. Meaningful public comment would be undermined if the program elements were constantly changing up until the day before the Secretary's decision. The 104 day rule affords the state 31 months following submission within which it may modify ifs laws and rules. In addition, after the Secretary's initial program decision, the states l ave additional opportunities to reyise their laws and regulations. All program dlenients other than laws and rules, including Attorney General's opinions, program narratives, descriptions and other information, may be revised by the state at any time prior to program approval. The Secretary will provide opportunity for public comment on those changes, as appropriate. The Secretary, in reviewing state' programs, is utilizing the criteria ofSection 503 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253), and 30 CFR 732.15. In reviewing the Missouri program, the Secretary has followed the federal rules as cited above under \"General Background on the Permanent Program\" and as affected by three recent decisions of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in In Re: Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation. Because of that litigation the court issued its initial decision irr two\"rounds.\" The Round I opinion, dated February 26,1980, denied several generic attacks on the permanent program regulations, but resulted in suspension or remanding of all or part of twenty-tao specific regulations. The Round II opinion, dated May 16,1980, denied additional generic attacks on the regulations, but remanded some 40 additional parts, sections or subsections of the regulations. The court also ordered the Secretary to \"affirmatively disapprove, under Section 503 (of SMCRA), those segments of a state program that incorporate a suspended or remanded regulation\" (Mem. Op., May 16, 1980, p. 49). However, on August 15, 1980, the court stayed-this portion of its opinion. The effect of this stay is to allow the Secretary to approve-state program provisions equivalent to remanded or suspended federal provisions in the three circumstances described in paragraph 1 below. Therefore, the Secretary is applying the following standard to the review of state program submissions: 1. The Secretary need not affirmatively disapprove state provisions similar -to those federal regulations which have been suspended or remanded by the district court where the state has adopted such provisions in a rulemaking or legislative proceeding which occurred either (1) before the enactment of SMCRA or (2) after the date of the Round H district court decision, since such state regulations clearly are not'based solely upon the suspended or remanded federal regulations. (3) The Secretary need not affirmatively disapprove provisions based updn suspended or remanded federal rules if a responsible state official has requested the Secretary to approve them. 2. The Secretary will affirmatively 'disapprove, to the extent required by the court's judgments, all provisions of a state program. which incorporate suspended or remanded federal rules and which'do not fall into one of the three'categories in paragraph one, above. The Secretary believes that the effect of his \"affirmative disapproval\" of a section in the state's regulations is thatthe requirements of that section are not enforceable in the permanent program at the federal level to the extent they have been disapproved. That is, no cause of action for enforcement of the provisions, to the extent disapproved, exists In the federal courts, and no federal inspection will result in notices of violation or cessation orders based upon the\"affirmatively disapproved\" provisions. The Secretary takes no position as to whether the affirmatively disapproved provisions are enforceable under state law and in state courts. Accordingly, these provisions are not being pre- empted or suspended, although the Secretary may have the power to do so under Section 504(g) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11. 3. A state program need not contain provisions to implement a suspended regulation and no state program will be disapproved for failure to contain a suspended regulation. 4. A state must have authority to implement all permanent program provisions of SMCRA, including those provisions of SMCRA upon which the remanded or suspended regulations were based. 5. A state program may not contain any provision that is inconsistent with a provision of SMCRA. 6. Programs will be evaluated only on those provisions other than the provisions that must be disapproved because of the court's order. The remaining provisions will be approved unconditionally, approved conditionally, or disapproved, in whole or in part, In accordance with 30 CFR 732,13. 7. Upon promulgation of new' regulations to replace those that have been suspended or remanded, the Secretary will afford states that have approved or conditionally approved programs a reasonable opportunity to amend their programs, as appropriate. In general, the Secretary expects that the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17 will govern this process. A list of the regulations suspended or-remanded as the result of the Round I and Round II litigation was published in the Federal Register On July 7,1980 (45 FR 45604). To codify decisions on state programs, federal programs, and other matters affecting individual states, OSM has established a new Subchapter T of 30 CFR Chapter VII. Subchapter T will consist of Parts 900 through 950. Provisions relating to Missouri will be found in 30 CFR Part 925. Background on the Missouri Program Submission 1, On February 1, 1980, OSM received a proposed regulatory program from the State of Missouri. The program was Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations 77019 submitted by the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission, the agency designated as the primary regulatory authority under the Missouri permanent program. Notice of receipt of the submission initiating the program review was published in the February 11, 1980, Federal Register (45 FR 9123- 9124) and in newspapers of general circulation in Missouri. The announcement invited public participation in the initial phase of the review process as it related to the Regional Director's determination of whether the submission was complete. On March 13,1980, the Regional Director held a public review meeting in Jefferson City, Missouri, on the program submission and its completeness. The public comment period on completeness began on February 11, 1980, and closed March 13,1980. On March 24,1980, the Regional Director published notice in the Federal Register announcing that the program submission had been determined to be complete (45 FR 18987). Amendments to the Missouri Program On May 14,1980, the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission submitted to OSM numerous revisions to the Missouri permanent program submission. On May 23,1980, the Regional Director published notice in the Federal Register (45 FR 34907-34909), and in newspapers of general circulation within the State, that the revisions to the Missouri program submission were available for public review and comment. The notice also set forth procedures for the public hearing and comment period on the substance of the Missouri program. On June 23,1980, the Regional Director held a public hearing on the Missouri submission in Kansas City, Missouri. The public comment period on the Missouri permanent regulatory program ended on July 1,1980. On July 1, 1980, OSM received a letter dated June 30,1980, from the Director of the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission indicating that Missouri could not adequately implement and administer the permanent program until October 1, 1980. Missouri cited the need to train staff and prepare for implementation of the permitting process. The letter indicated that Missouri woud be prepared to administer the permanent program by October 1,1980. On July 7, 1980, OSM received a document dated July 3, 1980, from the Director of the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission requesting that the Secretary approve certain program provisions proposed to beaffirmatively disapproved pursuant to the U.S. District Court opinion on state program provisions comparable to remanded or suspended federal regulations discussed above under \"General Background on the State Program Approval Process.\" See Administrative record number MO-146. This request was subsequently withdrawn as discussed in the fourth paragraph below. On July 16,1980 (45 FR 47713-47715), the Director published in the Federal Register a proposed list of the Missouri regulations to be affirmatively disapproved because they are comparable to federal rules suspended or remanded by the district court. The public was invited to comment on the completeness of the list. Comment was also invited on both the June 30th and July 3rd letters received from the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission. described above. On July 7,1980, the Regional Director submitted his recommendation to the Director of OSM that the Missouri program be approved in part and disapproved in part, together with copies of the transcripts of the public meeting and public hearing, written presentations, exhibits, copies of all public comments received and other documents comprising the administrative record. On July 16, 1980, the Secretary published a notice formally disclosing to the public the comments received on the Missouri program from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of Agriculture, and other federal agencies (45 FR 47712). On September 2, 1980, the Director of the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission withdrew the State's July 3, 1980, request that the Secretary not affirmatively disapprove certain state program provisions analogous to remanded or suspended federal regulations. See administrative record number MO-186. Also, see the paragraph entitled \"Other Secretarial Considerations\" below for a discussion of how the Secretary is proceeding on this issue. On September 17, 1980, the Director of OSM recommended to the Secretary that he approve with conditions the Missouri program. On August 7,1980, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency concurred in the Secretary's approval of those provisions of the Missouri program relating to air and water quality standards being approved today. See administrative record number MO-184. On August 11, 1980 and September 12, 1980, Missouri promulgated those regulations that were submitted to OSMIn proposed and pre-proposed form on May 14,1980. Those regulations corrected most of the deficiencies that OSM identified earlier to the State (See Administrative Record No. MO-98). Elements Upon Which the Secretary Evaluates the Program for This Decision In consideration of the matters discussed above under \"General Background on State Program Approval Process,\" the Secretary hereby sets forth the elements of the proposed Missouri program upon which the findings and decisions below are being made. (a)(1) Because of the 104 day rule promulgated May 20,1980,30 CFR 732.11(d) (45 FR 33927), only those statutory provisions and rules that were fully enacted on or before May 15, 1980, are being considered as a basis for this decision. (a](2) All provisions not fully enacted on the 104th day, including those presently enacted and proposed amendments and revisions to the Missouri permanent program, are being considered and discussed in this notice, but cannot be approved now by the Secretary. Other Secretarial Considerations Provisions of the Missouri program analogous to those federal rules suspended or remanded by the court were previously proposed for disapproval. A public comment period was held to determine the completeness of the list of provisions to be disapproved and the extent to which each of the provisions would be disapproved. See 45 FR 47713, July 16, 1980. No comments were received as a result of that notice. However, OSM has determined that the proposed list was incomplete in that Section 10 CSR 40- 8.040, Penalty Assessment, which is analogous to 30 CFR Part 845, was not included. Accordingly, those regulations identified at 45 FR 47713 (uly 16.1980) and Missouri regulation 10 CSR 40-8.040 (insofa. as it establishes a point system for assessing civil penalties) are being affirmatively disapproved by the Secretary in this decision. Secretary's Findings 1. In accordance with Section 503(a) of SMCRA, the Secretary finds that Missouri has, subject to the exceptions in to carry out the provisions of SMCRA and to meet its purposes in the following ways: (a) The Missouri Surface Coal Mining Act (MSCMIA) and the regulations adopted thereunder provide for the regulation of surface coal mining and 77020 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations reclamation operations on non-Indian and non-federal lands in Missouri in accordance with SMCRA, except that Missouri omits provisions for protection of Missouri Land'Reclamation Commission employees performing their duties in accordance with Section 704'of SMCRA. The general criminal provisions do not provide the same degree of protection for state employees as Section 704 of SMCRA does for federal employees. The Secretary finds that this deficieicy is minor because the history of state and coal industry relations in Missouri indicates that state employees will not likely be either significantly deterred in performing their duties or subject to violence or harassment during the time this deficiency is being corrected; (b) The MSCMA provides sanctions for violations of Missouri laws, regulations or conditions of-permits concerning surface coal mining and reclamation operations, and these sanctions meet the requirements of SMCRA, including civil and criminal actions, forfeiture of bonds, suspensions, revocations, withholding of permits, and the issuance of cessation orders by the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission or its inspectors; (c) The Missouri Land Reclamation Commission has sufficient administrative and technical personnel to enable Missouri to regulate surface coal mining and reclamation operations in accordance with the requirements of SMCRA; (d) Missouri law provides for the effective implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of a permit system that meets the requirements of SMCRA for the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on non- Indian and non-federal lands within Missouri; (e) The MSCMA has established a process for the designation of areas as unsuitable for surface coal mining in accordance with Section 522 of SMCRA,\u00b0 30 U.S.C. 1272; (f) Missouri has established, or the purpose of avoiding duplication, a process for coordinating the review and' issuance of permits for surface coal mining and reclamation operations with other federal and state permit processes applicable to the proposed operations;.(g) Missouri has fully enacted 11 regulations consistent with regulations issued pursuant to SMCRA,.with the following exceptions: (1) The Missouri regulation8 omit' enforcement authority provisions comparable to 30 CFR Part 843 including enforcement of cessation orders (843.11), enforcement of notices of violation (843.12), suspension or revocation ofpermits (843.13), service of notices of violation and cessation orders, formal review of citations (843.16), inability to comply (843.18) and injunctive relief (843.19). The Secretary finds that this 'deficiency is minor because the State has basic enforcement authority and procedures in the Missouri Surface Coal, Mining Act adequate to enforce the permanent program until said time as the deficiency is corrected. (2) Missouri omits regulations providing for citizen suits comparable to 30 CFR 700.13. The Secretary finds that this deficiency is minor because the MSCMA contains authority adequate to allow citizen suits as required by Section 520 of SMCRA. The absence of\" the procedural provision contained in 30 CFR 700.13 should not adversely affect a citizen's rights during the time the deficiency is being corrected. - (3) Missouri omits regulations allowing for the public participation aspects of 43 CFR Part 4, as required by 30 CFR 840.15, including the award of costs and attorneys' fees found in 43 CFR 4.1290. The Secretary finds that this deficiency is minor because the award of costs and attorneys' fees is authorized by the MSCMA. The absence of implementing regulations should not adversely affect public participation during the time this deficiency is being corrected. (4) Missouri omits regulations to provide procedures for petitioning the Director of the Land Reclamation .Commission to initiate rulemaking consistent with 30 CFR 700.12. Public participation in rulemaking under a state program is required by 30 CFR 732.15(b)(10). The Secretary finds that this deficiency is minor because theI absence of petition procedures in the Missouri regulations should not adversely affect public participation in rulemaking during the time this deficiency is being corrected. (5) Missouri omits permitting xequirements and performance standards for underground mining in accordance with 30 CFR Parts 782, 783, 784 and 817, and failed to prohibit ' underground mining until after state regulations are promulgated. The Secretary finds that this deficiency is minor because the State has basic authorityin the MSMCA to regulate underground mining until such time as the permitting and performance standards apply to underground mining. Further, no underground mining is being conducted or is proposed to be conducted in the state. (6) Missouri omits permitting requirements and performance standards for concurrent surface and underground mining operations inaccordance with 30 CFR 785.18 and 30 CFR Part 818, and failed to prohibit such operations until after state regulations are promulgated. The Secretary finds that this deficiency is minor because no concurrent surface and underground mining operations are being conducted in the state and no such operations are proposed to be conducted during the time this deficiency is being corrected, (7) Missouri omits permitting requirements and performance standards for in situ processing activities in accordance with 30 CFR 785.22 and 30 CFR Part 828 and failed to prohibit such operations until after state regulations are promulgated. The Secretary finds that this deficiency Is minor because no in situ processing activities are being conducted in the state and no such activities are proposed to be conducted during the time this deficiency is being corrected. (8) Section 10 CSR 40-.3.040(4)(D)(4) provides for a broad variance for restoration of stream channels and construction of permanent diversions after temporary diversions have been constructed. This variance is not allowed under SMCRA or 30 CFR 816.44(d). The Secretary finds that this deficiency is minor because the restoration of stream channels and construction of permanent diversions should not be adversely affected during the time that this deficiency is being corrected. - (9) Section 10 CSR 40-3.050(4)(A]2B is inconsistent with 30 CFR 816.65(af[2)[1t) 'in that it does not require \"persons\", to be notified prior to night blasting. The Secretary finds that this deficiency Is minor because the state has agreed during the time this deficiency is being corrected not to grant the special variance for night blasting unless the applicant agrees to notify all persons consistent with 30 CFR 816.05(a)(2)(i). (10) Section 10 CSR 40--3.120(7)(B)4 omits specific performance standards for the revegetation of commercial forest land and is, therefore, inconsistent with 30 CFR 816.117(b)(4). The Secretary finds that this deficiency is minor because revegetation of forest land should not be adversely affected during the time that this deficiency Is being corrected. (11) Section 10 CSR 40-5.020(5)(B)2 Is ,inconsistent with 30 CFR 764.15(b)(2) because of the omission of requirements that the Land Reclamation Commission notify the public whenever a lands- unsuitable petition is received. The Secretary finds that this deficiency is minor because the state has agreed to notify the public whenever a lands- unsuitable petition is received during Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations the time that this deficiency is being corrected. (12) Missouri regulations omit a provision requiring that all persons engaged in surface coal mining and reclamation operations comply with the terms and conditions of their permits and the state's permanent regulatory program. This omission is inconsistent with 30 CFR 771.19. The Secretary finds that this deficiency is minor because the state has the authority in the MSCMA to require persons engaged in mining and reclamation operations to comply with the terms and conditions of their permits and the state's permanent regulatory program. Further, this deficiency will be corrected prior to issuance of any permanent program permits. (13) Section 10 CSR 40--6.050(8)(B)7 omits a requirement for a description in an operations and reclamation plan of how toxic-forming materials will be disposed. This omission is inconsistent with 30 CFR 780.18(b)(7). The Secretary finds that this deficiency is minor because operation and reclamation plans are not required during the time this deficiency is being corrected. (14) Section 10 CSR 40-6.070(12)(B) does not require permittees to grant right of entry to authorized representatives of the Secretary of the Interior for inspection and enforcement purposes, making it inconsistent with 30 CFR 786.27(b). The Secretary finds that this deficiency is minor because during the time this deficiency is being corrected, authorized representatives have the right of entry as provided in 30 CFR 842.13. (15) Section 10 CSR 40-6.090(4)(A)1 does not specify the parameters that will be used to determine what changes constitute significant departures from a mining permit. This is inconsistent with 30 CFR 788.12(a)(1). The Secretary finds that this deficiency is minor because during the time this deficiency is being corrected the state will not be required to determine what changes constitute significant departures. (16) Section 10 CSR 40-7.010(7)(D) grants an exception from revegetation requirements for a long term intensive agricultural land use. This is inconsistent with 30 CFR 805.13(d) as suspended by court order. No exemptions from those requirements of 30 CFR Part 816 derived from Section 515(b)(20) of SMCRA are presently allowed. The Secretary finds that this deficiency is minor because the state will not have an opportunity to grant an exception to these revegetation requirements during the time this deficiency is being corrected. (17) Section 10 CSR 40-7.030(1) is inconsistent with 30 CFR 807.11(g)because it does not expressly state that a permittee or any affected person may request a hearing on bond release decisions. The Secretary finds that this deficiency is minor because bond release decisions will not be made during the time this deficiency is being corrected. (18) Section 40-7.040(2) omits a procedure for bond forfeiture where the permittee failed to comply with a compliance schedule. This is inconsistent with 30 CFR 808.13(a)(4). The Secretary finds that this deficiency is minor because bonds will not be forfeited during the time this deficiency is being corrected. (19) Section 40-8.010(1)(A)60, definition of permittee, omits the phrase\"persons required to hold a permit,\" thus failing to include wildcat operators. This is inconsistent with the definition in the federal rules under 30 CFR 701.5. The Secretary finds that this deficiency is minor because wildcat operators will not be required under the permanent program to have a permit during the time this deficiency is being corrected. (20) Section 40-8.010(1)(A)87, definition of surface coal mining operations contain additional definitions of affected land and \"disturbed land\" , which are defined and used differently in the federal regulations in 30 CFR 701.5. Missouri also includes separate definitions of \"affected area\" and \"disturbed area.\" The Secretary finds that this deficiency is minor because the state will not need to make determinations based on these definitions during the time this deficiency is being corrected. (21) Missouri regulations omit a definition of \"underground development waste,\" thereby being inconsistent with 30 CFR 701.5. The Secretary finds that this deficiency Is minor because the state will not need to make determinations based on this definition during the time this deficiency Is being corrected. (22) Section 10 CSR 40-8.040(1) omits a time frame for the Land Reclamation Commission to notify an operator of a penalty assessment. This is inconsistent with the thirty day maximum specified by 30 CFR 845.17(b). The Secretary finds that this deficiency is minor because the state agrees to give the operator notice within thirty days of a penalty assessment during the time this deficiency is being corrected. 2. As required by Sections 503(b)(]}- (3) of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1253(b)(1-{3), and 30 CFR 732.11-732.13, the Secretary has through OSM: (a) Solicited and publicly disclosed the views of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, theSecretary of Agriculture, and the heads of other federal agencies concerned with or having special expertise pertinent to the proposed Missouri program; (b) Obtained the written concurrence of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency with respect to those aspects of the Missouri program that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act as amended, (33 U.S.C. 1151-1175), and the Clean Air Act as amended, (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.). (See administrative record number MO-184) and; (c) Held a public review meeting in Jefferson City, Missouri, on March 13, 1980. to discuss the completeness of the Missouri program submission and subsequently held a public hearing in Kansas City, MIssouri, on June 23,1980, on the substance of the program submission. 3. In accordance with Section 503(b)(4) of SMCRA. 30 U.S.C. 1253(b)(4), the Secretary finds the State of Missouri has the legal authority and qualified personnel necessary for the enforcement of the environmental protection standards of SMCRA and 30 CFR Chapter VII. as noted more specifically in these findings. 4. In accordance with 30 CFR 732.15, and on the basis of information in the Missouri program submission, including the section-by-section comparison of the Missouri law and regulations with SMCRA and 30 CFR Chapter VII, public comments, testimony and written presentations at the public meeting and hearing, and other relevant information, the Secretary finds that (a) the proposed Missouri program provides for the state to carry out the provisions and meet the purposes of SMCRA and 30 CFR Chapter VII within its borders, and that Missouri has not proposed any alternative approaches to the requirements of 30 CFR Chapter VII pursuant to 30 CFR 731.13. This finding Is made pursuant to 30 CFR 732.15[a). (b) Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.15(b)(1). the Secretary finds that the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission has the authority under Missouri laws and regulations to implement, administer, and enforce all applicable requirements consistent with 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter K, and the Missouri program includes provisions to do so, with the exceptions noted in Findings 1(g)5, 1(g)6, 1(g)7. 1(g)8, 30 CFR 732.15(b)(2) the Secretary finds that the Missouri Land Reclamation Commisson has the authority under Missouri laws and regulations and the Missouri program includes provisions to implement,77021 77022 FederalRegister I Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations administer and enforce a permit system consistent with 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter G, and prohibit surface coal mining and reclamation operations without a permit issued by Missouri, with the exceptions noted in Findings 1(gJ5, 1(g)6, 1(g)7, 1(g)12, 30 CFR 732.15(b)(3), the Secretary finds that the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission has the authority under Missouri laws and the Missouri program includes provisions to regulate coal exploration consistent with 30 CFR Parts 776 and 815 and to prohibit coal exploration that does not comply with 30 CFR Parts 776 and 815. (e) Pursuant to 30 CER 732.15(b)(4), the Secretary finds that the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission has the authority under Missouri laws and-the Missouri program includes-provisions to require that persons extracting coal incidental to government-financed construction maintain information on- site consistent with 30 CFR Part 707. These provisions are at 10 CSR 40-8.020 of the Missouri regulations. () Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.15(b](5), the Secretary finds that the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission has the authority under Section 444.810 of the MSCMA and in Part 10 CSR 40-8.030 of the Missouri regulations, and the Missouri program includes provisions to enter, inspect and monitor all coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations onnon-indian and non-federal lands within Missouri consistent with the requirements of Section 517 of SMCRA and 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter L with the exception noted in Finding 1(g)14. (g) Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.15(b](6), the Secretary finds that the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission has the authority under Missouri laws and the Missouri program includes provisions to implement, administer afid enforce a system of performance bonds and liability insurance, or other equivalent guarantees, consistent with SMCRA and 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter-J (as promulgated March 13, 1979 44FR 15312) with the exceptions noted in Findings 1(g)(16), 1(g)(17), and 1(g)(18). The performance bond and liability insurance provisions of Section 507(f), 509, 510, and 519 of SMCRA and 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter J are incorporated in Sections 444.820(7), 444.830, 444.835, and 444.875 of MSCMA and in Chapter 7 of the Missouri regulations. (h) Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.15(b)(7), the Secretary has determined that the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission has the authority under Section 444.870 of the MSCMA, and the programprovides in Part 10 CSR 40-8.040 of the Missouri regulations, to provide for civil and criminal sanctions for violation of Missouri law, regulations and conditions of permits and exploration approvals including civil and criminal penalties, in accordance with Section 518 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1268) and consistent with 30 CFR Part 845, as remanded by the district court, including the same or similar procedural requirements. (i) Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.15(b)(8), the Secretary finds that the Missouri Land Reclamation Commisson has the authority under Section 444.885 of the MSCMA, and the program contains in Parts 10 CSR 40-8.030 and 10 CSR 40- '8.040 of the Missouri regulations, provisions to issue, modify, terminate and enforce notices of violation, cessation orders and show-cause orders in accordance with Section 521 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1271) and consistent with 30 CFR Chapter VII; Subchapter L including the same or similar procedural requirements, with the exceptions noted in Findings 1(g)1 and 1(g)22. U) Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.15(b)(9), the Secretary finds that the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission has authority under Section 444.890 of MSCMA and Parts 10 CSR 4G-5.010 and 10 CSR 40- 5.020 of the Missouri regulations, and the Missouri program contains provisions for the designation of areas as unsuitable for surface coal mining -consistent with 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter F, with the exception noted in Finding 1(g)11. (k] Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.15(b)(10), the Secretary finds that the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission has the authority and the Missouri program provides for public participation in the development, revision and enforcement of Missouri regulations consistent with the public participation requirements of SMCRA and 30 CFR Chapter VII with the following exceptions noted in Findings 1(g)2, 1(g)3 and 1(g)4. The Secretary further finds that the public has had a meaningful opportunity to participate in the development of the state program submitted to OSM based.on the information in the administrative record, the public hearings Missouri held on the adoption of regulations pursuant to the MSCMA inJefferson City, Missouri on December 4,1979, June 3, .1980, and July 2,.1980, and the public comment periods provided pursuant to the Missouri Administrative Procedures Act. (I) Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.15(b)(11), the Secretary finds that the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission has the authority under Missouri laws and the Missouri program includes provisions to monitor, review,-and enforce theprohibition against indirect or direct financial interests in coal mining operations by employees of the Missour! Land Reclamation Commission consistent with 30 CFR Part 705. These provisions are contained in Section 444.885(8) of the MSCMA and in Part 10 CSR 40-8.060 of the Missouri regulations. (in) Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.15(b)(12), the Secretary finds that the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission has the authority under Section 444.905(4) of the MSCMA to require the training, examination, and certification of persons engaged in or responsible for blasting and the use of explosives in accordance with Section 719 of SMCRA. Missouri has no regulations on the training, examination, and certification of persons engaged in blasting, but 30 CFR 732.15(b)(12) does not require a state to implement regulations governing such training, examination and certification until six months after federal regulations for these provisions have been promulgated. These federal regulations have not been promulgated at this time. (n) Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.15(b)(13), the Secretary finds that the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission has the authority unddr Section 444.020(4] of the MSCMA and Part 1Q CSR 40-8.05O of the regulations, and the program contains provisions to provide for a small operator assistance program consistent with 30 CFR Part 795. (o) Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.15(b)(14), the Secretary finds that the Missouri program does not contain authority to provide for protection of employees of the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission in accordance with the protection afforded federam employees under Section 704 of SMCRA. See Finding 1(a). (p) Pursuant to 30 CFR 732,15(b)(15), the Secretary finds that the Missouri Land Reclamation Commissioh has the authority under Sections 444.895 and 444.900 of MSCMA and parts 10 CSR 40- 8.030 and 10 CSR 40-8.040 of the Missouri regulations to provide for administrative and judicial review of Missouri program actions in accordance with Sections 525 and 526 of SMCRA and 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter L. (q) Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.15(b)(10), the Secretary finds that the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission has authority under Missouri laws and the Missouri program contains provisions to cooperate and coordinate with and provide documents and other information to the Office of Surface Mining under the provisions of 30 CFR Chapter VII. Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1900 / Rules and Regulations 77023 (r) Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.15(c), the Secretary finds that the MSCMA and regulations adopted thereunder and the other laws and regulations of Missouri do not contain provisions that would interfere with or preclude implementation of the provisions of SMCRA and 30 CFR Chapter VII. (s) Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.15(d), the Secretary finds that the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission and other agencies having a role in the program have sufficient legal, technical, and administrative personnel and sufficient- funds to implemenL administer, and enforce the provisions of the program, the requirements of 30 CFR 732.15(b), and other applicable state and federal laws. Disposition of Comments 1. The National Park Service (NPS) identified six counties in Missouri that contain NPS units and requested that they be: 1) consulted on any surface coal mine application that may have an impact on units under their jurisdiction; 2) allowed to participate in inspections of operations that may have an effect on an NPS unit; and 3) able to participate in the development of criteria for designating lands unsuitable for surface mining near NPS units. The Secretary has determined that there are no coal deposits located in or within close proximity to the six counties identified by the National Park Service, thereby alleviating NPS's concerns. No charge, therefore, is required. 2. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) requested that narrative Section VII 9-10, submitted pursuant to 30 CFR 731.14(g)(9) and (10), be revised to include coordination and consultation between the Missouri Department of Natural Resources and the FWS. Missouri Sections VII 9-11 were amended to include coordination and consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. (See Administrative Record No. MO-114). 3. The Regional Office of the FWS submitted a statement, in accordance with the Section 7 Interagency Cooperation Regulations (50 CFR 402,43 FR 870) and the Endangered Species Act, as amended, preliminarily indicating that the Missouri program would jeopardize some endangered species and their habitat However, the Director of FWS has subsequently submitted a non-jeopardy opinion concerning the Missouri program submission. See Administrative Record No. MO-188. 4. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) recommended that Missouri be notified of the existing Bureau of Land Management [BLM), USGS, and Officeof Surface Mining (OSM) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the management of federal coal. Missouri has been provided a copy of the joint MOU. 5. The USGS recommended that Missouri include procedures for processing any proposed mine plans or permits that include federal lands. Such processing procedures need not be included in the state plan because. 1) in states without a cooperative agreement with the Interior Department, the Secretary has sole responsibility for rcview and approval of permit applications on federal lands, and 2) in slates with an approved cooperative agreement, the Secretary has joint responsibility with the state, and the procedure for processing mine plans or peim.ts will be identified in the cooperatve agreement. 6. The Department of Agriculture (USDA) suggested language be added to the narrative discussion on bonding to insure that surface owners are notified of the decision of the Director of the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission on bond releases. The provisions of Section 10 CSR 40-7.030(I](E)2 of the Missouri regulations insure that surface owneys will be notified of decisions concerning bond releases made by the Director of the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission. 7. The USDA suggested language be added to the narrative discussion on exploration permits to insure that federal, state, and local agencies will be notified when lands they administer are affected by an exploration application. The provisions of the Missouri program apply only to operations on non-Indian and non-federal lands. Although Section 10 CSR 40-6.020 of the Missouri regulations does not require that such agencies be specifically notified of an exploration application, it does -rovide for general public notice. Furz hermore, local governmental entities will be advised of decisions on explorat!on applications (10 CSR 40-6.020[4)(A). This notification procedure is the same as prescribed in 30 CFR Part 776. 8. The USDA suggested adding \"or the sU: fie owner\" after \"public\" in item LE 2. on p.ige 4 6 of chapter VI. T-his is unnecessary bccaase the term \"pubhc\" includes surface o',ners; therefore, s5lrfacp owners already have fl e rlg!Ni to request inspections. 9. The USDA commented that provisions found at RSM 444.774(1] on pnge 2 33 of Chapter IV do not azluw enough flexibility for grading i% hn timber production is the intended postmining land use. The provisions that the USDA is concerned with are from the 1975 Missouri Strip Mine law that isno longer in effect. Therefore, no change is necessary. 10. The USDA indicated that te regulations do not adequately address ecological succession when timber production is the postmining land use, and largely ignore past research on reforestation of mined lands. The Secretary recognizes that complex ecological relationships characterize forest ecosystems, however, the revegetation standards found at 10 CSR 40-3.120 in the Missouri regulations adequately insure that a diverse, effective and permanent vegetative cover of the same seasonal variety native to the area will be established. 11. The USDA commented that the definition of \"Rangeland\" found at 10 CSR 40-2.030 should not include the word \"forest\" as the twy are not compatible. The interim regulation referred to by the cominenter has been revised and the word \"Rangeland\" is no lorngir definad in amended regulation 10 CSR 40-8.010. 12. The USDA suggestd that funds received from the payment of fees or bond forfeitures be made available to the state nursery to guarantee trae seedling orders from mine operators for reclamation purposes. The Secretary has no authority under SMCRA to require such a procedure be included in a state program. 13. The USDA suggested that experimental mining should be permitted separately and therefore have no effect on the bond release on other parts of the permit area. The commenter also suggested that operators be able to amend existing permits to include experimental practices. Finally, the USDA commented that it would be helpful if exploration permits were issued directly to research agencas. The Secretary has determined that all of the aforementionel options are possible under 10 CSR 40-6.060 of the Missouri rculations. 14. The USDA suggested that MEiZ:ouri cater into a cooperative agreement or sign a memorandam of understanding raith the U.S. Forest Service to rulate mining in the Mark Twain National FoIrest. The com-menter also suggested that timbi:r cleared from mining sitzs on Foreat Service land b- utilized rathser than buried or burned. Under Stion 23 of S.MCRA it is optional for a state to cnter into a cooperative agreement wirh the Seretary to regulate mining on federal lands. Ho wever, 30 CFR 741.20 and 741.21(a][) require that the Regional Director of OSM consult with the authorized officer of the surface managing agency prior to taking any action on a mine application on federal lands. Also, 30 CFR 740.4(d) requires the 77024 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations consent or concurrence of the surface management agency concerning special requirements relative to the protection of non-mineral resources, including timber, on areas affected by surface coal mining. 15. The USDA suggested adding surface owners to the list of people who receive notification of decisions made on exploration permit applications by the Land Reclamation Commission. The provisions for who must be notified of such decisions in the Missouri program are the same as those in the Secretary's regulations at 30 CFR 776.14(a). Under these provisions, the public must be notified of these decisions by publication in a local newspaper. No change is required. 16. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) suggested that Missouris submission contain regulations for performance standards consistent with 30 CFR Parts 817 and 828 covering underground mining activities and in situ processing respectively. The Secretary agrees that Missouri be required to promulgate regulations concerning underground mining and in situ processing consistent with 30 CFR Parts 817 and 828. See findings 1(g)5 and 1(g)7. 17. The EPA expressed concern that coordination with other agencies could be a problem, particularly coordination with the agency charged with water quality responsibilities under Sections 208 and 303 of the Clean Water Act. The Missouri program specifically provides for coordination with the Missouri Clean Water Commission with respect to the Clean Water Act. Also Section 10 CSR 40-6.01013)(B) specifically requires coordination on Sections 208 and 303 matters. 18. The EPA suggested that Missouri inspectors be \"cross-trained\" in air and water quality monitoring to improve the effectiveness of the program. The Secretary does not have the authority to require such \"cross-training\". 1g, The EPA recommended that performance standards for coal exploration be included in the Missouri program if exploration activities are permitted. Regulations consistent with 30 CFR 815.15 regarding such standards are included in the Missouri program at 10 CSR 40-4.010. 20. The Department of Energy (DOE) suggested that a hydrologist, geologist, and a mining engineer be added to the staff of the Land Reclamation Commission. Missouri has amended its organizational structure in 731.14(e) to include a hydrologist and an engineer. The position of reclamation specialist lists a background in geology or aclosely related field as one of the requirements. 21. ThdeDOE suggested that the narrative for 30 CFR 731.14(g)(4) be expanded to explain in greater detail the provisions for public participation in the inspection and monitoring of coal . exploration, mining and reclamation operations. Public participation in these matters is discussed in detail in the narrative portion of the Missouri' program for Section 731.14(g)(14). 22. The DOE commented that Missouri did not include a regulation consistent with 30 CFR 771.19, Compliance with -Permits. The Secretary agrees that Missouri should promulgate a regulation consistent with 30 CFR 771.19. See Finding 1(g)12. Further, the Secretary preliminarily determined that proposed regulation 10 CSR 40-6.010(l)(c) appears consistent with 30 CFR 771.19. 23. The DOE commented that Missouri did not include a regulation consistent with 30 CFR 827.11 regarding the applicability of special performance standards to certain coal processing plants and support facilities. The Secretary finds that Missouri regulation 10 CSR 40-4.050(1) providing for requirements for coal processing plants and support facilities is consistent with 30 CFR 827.11. 24. The DOE commented that the Missouri program should include regulations comparable to 30 CFR Parts 782, 783, and 784 concerning Underground Mining Permit * Applications. The Secretary agrees that the Missouri program must include regulations consistent with 30 CFR Parts 782, 783, and 784. See finding 1(g)5. 25. The DOE asked that provisions comparable to 30CFR Part 824 be included in the Missouri program to assure protection of the environment from mining in areas of \"hilly terrain\". The Secretary disagrees. Under Sections 515 (c) and (e) of SMCRA, these provisions are optional. Not including this Part, which is an exemption from the requirement to return land to its approximate original contour for mining on steep slopes and mountains, makes the Missouri program more stringent, i.e., the exemption is not available under the Missouri program. Therefore, no change is required. '26. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) commented that Section 10 CSR 40-2.070(2)(1) did not specify the design storm duration in regard to dams constructed with waste material. Section 10 CSR 40-2.070(2)(1) is an interim program regulation and will not be a part of the regulations contained in Missouri's permanent program. Furthermore, Missouri's permanent regulation on this subject,Section 10 CSR 40-3.080(l1)lA), \"Dams and Embankments: Design consistent with 30 CFR 816.93. 27. MSHA commented that Section 10 CSR 40-2.070(4) did not require that an abandonment plan be approved by the regulatory authority prior to the removal of dams. Again, this section was an interim regulation and will not be a part of the permanent program. Missodri's -permanent program regulation on this subject, 10 CSR 40-3.040(16), \"Postmining rehabilitation of sedimentation ponds, diversions, impoundments, and facilities,\" is consistent with 30 CFR 816.56, 28. MSHA commented that the 100- year, 24-hour design requirement found at Section 10 CSR 40-3.080(10)(B) of the Missouri regulations was less stringent than MSHA's 100-year, 6-hour requirement. The Secretary will not require the state to adopt a more stringent requirement than his rules and since the state regulation is consistent with 30 CFR 816.92(b), the recommended change is not required. 29. MSHA commented that Missouri's definitions of \"explosives\" and \"blasting agent\", found in Section 8 CSR 30- 2.010(6) of the Missouri Division of Labor and Industrial Relations, regulations differ from MSHA's definitions in 30 CFR 77.2. The ' regulations of the Division of Labor and Industrial Relations are not a part of the proposed state program and are, therefore, not being evaluated by the Secretary except that he has determined that they are not inconsistent with SMCRA. 30. One commenter stated that the Missouri program provides for only two types of performance bonds, surety and -certificate of deposit, and requested that OSM require the state to allow all forms of bonding allowed under the federal regulations. The Secretary has determined that the bonding provisions folind at 10 CSR 40 Chapter 7 of the Missouri regulations are consistent with 30 CFR Subchapter J. Any decision by a state to allow fewer bonding alternatives than the federal rules provide would not render the state program less stringent than the minimum federal requirements. Background on Conditional Approval The Secretary is fully committed to two key aims which underlie SMCRA. The Act calls for comprehensive regulation of the effects of surface coal mining on the environment and public health and safety and for the Secretary to assist-the states in becoming the primary regulators under the Act. To enable the states to achieve that Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations ,,2a primacy, the Secretary has undertaken many activities of which several are particularly noteworthy. The Secretary has worked closely with several state organizations such as the Interstate Minng Compact Commssion, the Council of State Governments, the National Governors Association and the Western Interstate Energy Board. Through these groups OSM has frequently met with state regulatory authority personnel to discuss informally how the Act should be administered, with particular reference to umque circumstances in individual states. Often these meetings have been a way for OSM and the states to test new ideas and for OSM to explain portions of the federal requirements and how the states might meet them. Alternative state regulatory options, the \"state window\" concept, for example, were discussed at several meetings of the Interstate Miing Compact Commission and the National Governors Association. The Secretary has dispensed over $6.9 million in program development grants and over $37.6 million in initial program grants to help the states to develop their programs to adiminister their initial programs, to tram their personnel in the new requirements, and to purchase new equipment. In several instances OSM detailed its personnel to states to assist in the preparation of their permanent program submissions. OSM has also met with individual states to determine how best to meet the Act's environmental protection goals. Equally important, the Secretary structured the state program approval process to assist the states in achieving primacy. He voluntarily provided his preliminary views on the adequacy of each state program to identify needed changes and to allow them to be made without penalty to the state. The Secretary adopted a special policy to insure that communication between hun and the states remained open and uni hbibited at all times. This policy was critical to avoiding a period of enforced silence with a state after the close of the public comment period on its program and has been a vital part of the program review process (See 44 FR 54444, September 19, 1979]. The Secretary has also developed in his regulations the critical ability to approve conditionally a state program. Under the Secretary's regulations, conditional approval gives full primacy to a state even though there are minor deficiencies in a program. This power is not expressly authorized by the Act; it was adopted through the Secretary's rulemaking authority under 30 USC 2o1(c). 5W(b). and 53(a)[7).The Act expressly gives the S=retary only two options-to approve or disapprove a state program. Read literally, the Secretary would h-v.e no flexibilitv he would have to approve those programs that are letter-perfcct and disapprove all others, To a.rnd that result and in recognition of the difficulty of developing an acceptable prri, the Secretary adopted the regulai',n providing the authority to appro. e conditionally a program. Conditional approval has a vital effect for progars approved in the Secret ir s initial decision: it results in the implementation of the permanent program in a state months earlier 1han rmght otherwise be antiupatcd. While t&is may not be significant in states that already have comprehensive suface mining regulatory programs, in malty states that earlier implementation w1 initiate a much higher degree of environmental protection. It abla implements the rights SMCRA rr a to citizens to participate in the regulation of surface cual nnimng through soliciting their v.ews at hearings and meetings and enabling thcm to file requests to designate L!nds as unsuitable for mining if they are frcgle, historic, critical to agriculture, or sumply cannot be reclaimed to th ir p1ur productive capability. The Secretary considers thrce fLcturs in deciding whether a program qaalfies for conditional approval. r'rst i she state's willingness to make gooi waith efforts to effect the necessary chtmgcs. Without the state's commitment, the option of conditional approval may not b used. Second, no part of the program can be incomplete. As the preamble to the regulations says, the program, even with deficiencies, must \"provide for implementation and administration for all processes, procedures, and systems required by the Act and these regulations\" (44 FR 14961). That is. a state must be able to operate the basic components of the permanent program, the designation process; the permit and coal exploration systems; the bond and insurance requirements; the performance standards; and the inspection and enforcement systems. In addition there must be a functional regulatory authority to implement the other parts of the program. If some fundamental component is nssing, conditional approval may not be used. Third, the deficiencies must be minor. For each deficiency or group of deficiencies, the Secretary considers the significance of the deficiency m light of the particular state in question. Examples of deficiencies that would be minor m virtually all circumstances arecorrection of clerical errors and rcsolution of ambiguitics through attorney general's opinions, ravs:i regulations, policv statementE, chan-:s deficimncies rzq_-ire md;-=duc ci'nridcration. An micst lMkely in __a pormtting render the permit sf'ytcm tn:zrIete beCause prmits could still be IZsuoEI the !ack of any public particpatien ciuld ba such a departure from a fundamental purpose of the Act that the uefinncy woild most likely be major. The use of a conditional approval is not and cannot be a substitute for the adiption of an -dequate program Section 7j2.13[i) of Title 30 of the regulations g7. es the Secretary h ttle d[eretion in terminating programs %nwere the state, in the SEcretary's view, fa Js to fulfill the conditions. The purpose of the conditional authoriv power is to assist, not excuse, states from achieving compliance with SMCR,. Conditional Approval As indicated above under Secratu-y s Findings i(a] and 1(g), there are twenty- threc minor defifeenci-s that the Secretary requres be corrected. In all other respects, the Missouri program (excluding provisions that must be disanprovEd to comply wth the order of the U.S. District Court for the Distnct of Columbia, May 16, 19 )0 meats the critria for approval. The first deficiency, as indicatcl in Finding 1(a), is the absence ofprovisions for protection of Missouri Land Recamation Commission employeas performing their duties in accordance with Section 704 of SMCRA. The second deficiency, as indicated in Finding 1(g)(1), is the absence of regulatory pro.isions providing far enforcement authority in accordarca with 30 CFR Part 843. The third deficiency, as indicated in Finding 1(g)(2), is the absence of regulations providing for citizen suits in accordance with 30 CFR 700.13. The fourth deficiency, as indicated in Finding 1(g)(3], is the absence of regulatory provisions providing for recovery of costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, in accordance with 43 CFR 4.1290-4.1296. The filth deficiency, as indicated in Finding 1(g)(4), Is the absence of regulatory provisions providing for procedures for petitioning the Director of the Land Reclamation Commission to initiate rulemaking in accordance with 30 CFR 732.15(b)(10). 77026 Federal Register [ Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations The sixth deficiency, as indicated in Finding 1(g)(5), is the absence of permitting requirements and - performance standards for underground mining operations in accordance with 30 CFR Parts 782, 783, 784 and 817. The seventh deficiency, as indicated in Finding 1(g)(6], is the abseice of permitting requirements and performance standards for concurrent surface and underground mining operations in accordance with 30 CFR 785.18 and 30 CFR Part 818. The eighth deficiency, as indicated in Finding 1(g)(7), is the absence of permitting requirenients and performance standards for in situ processing activities in accordance with 30 CFR 785.22 and 30 CFR Part 828. The ninth deficiency, as indicated in Finding 1(g)(8), concerns the inclusion in the Missouri regulations of a broad variance for restoration of stream channels and construction of permanent diversions after temporary diversions were constructed. This variance is not in accordance with SMCRA of 30 CFR 81.44(d). The tenth deficiency, as indicated in Finding 11(g)(9), concerns the inconsistency between the Missouri regulations and 30 CFR 816.65(a)(2)(ii) concerning who is to be notified prior to blasting at night time. The eleventh deficiency, as indicated in Finding 1[g)(10), is the absence of specific performance standards for the regulation of commercial forest land in accordance with 30 CFR 816.117(b)(4). The twelth deficiency, as indicated in Finding 1(g)(11), concerns the inconsistency between the Missouri regulations and 30 CFR 764.15(b)(2) relative to the public notification procedures upon receipt of land unsuitable petitions. The thirteenth deficiency, as indicated in Finding 1(g)(12), is the absence of a -provision requiring that all persons engaged in surface coal mining and reclamation operations comply with the terms and conditions of their permits and the state's permanent regulatory program in accordance with 30 CFR 771.19. The fourteenth deficiency, as indicated in Finding 1(g)(13), is the absence of a provision requiring a description in the reclamation and operation plan of how toxic materials will be disposed of in accordance with 30 CFR 780.18(b)(7). The fifteenth deficiency, as indicated in Finding 1(g)(14), is the absence of a provision grantinig the right of entry to mine sites to authorized representatives of the Secretary in accordance with 30 CFR 786.27(b).The sixteenth deficiency, as indicated in Finding 1(g)[15), is the absence of specific parameters that will be used to determjne significant departures from mining permits in accordance with 30 CFR 788.12(a)(1). The seventeenth deficiency, as - indicated in Finding 1(g)(16), concerns the inclusion in the Missouri regulations of an exception from revegetation requirements for long term intensive agricultural land uses. This exception is not in accordance with 30 CFR 805.13(d) as suspended by court order. The eighteenth deficiency, as indicated in Findidng 1(g)(17), concerns the inconsistency of the Missouri regulations with 30 CFR 807.11(g) as it relates to requests for hearings on bond release decisions.The nineteenth deficiency, as indicated in Finding 1(g)(18], is the absence of a procedure for bond forfeiture where the permittee fails to comply with a compliance schedule in accordance with 30 CFR 808.13(a)(4). The twentieth deficiency, as indicated in Finding 1(g)(19), is the inconsistency of Missouri's definition of \"permittee\"- and OSM's definition found at 30 CFR 701.5. The twenty-first deficiency, as indicated in Finding 1(g)(20), concerns the inconsistency of Missiouri's definition of \"surface coal mining operation\" and OSM's definition found at 30 CFR 701.5. The twepty-second deficiency, as indicated in Finding 1(g)(21), is the absence of a definition of \"underground development waste\" in the Missouri regulations. The twenty-third deficiency, as indicated in Finding 1(g)(22), is the absence of a provision requiring the Land Reclamation Commission to notify' operators of a penalty assessment within thirty days as specified by 30 CFR 845.17(b). Given the nature of these deficiencies , and their magnitude in relation to all the other provisions of the Missouri program, the Secretary of the Interior, has concluded that they are minor deficiencies. Accordingly, the program is eligible for conditional approval under 30 CFR 732.13(i) because: 1. The deficiencies are of a size and nature as to render no part of the Missouri programincomplete since all other aspects of the prbgram meet the requirements of SMCRA and 30 CFR Chapter VII and these deficiencies, which will be promptly'corrected, will not directly affect environmental performance at coal mines; 2. Missouri has initiated and is actively proceeding with steps to correct the deficiencies; and3. Missouri has agreed, by letter dated October 28,1980, from Governor Teasdale, to correct the regulation deficiencies by April 1, 1981, and the Statutory deficiency by October 1, 1081, Accordingly, the Secretary Is conditionally approving the Missouri program. The approval shall terminate If regulations correcting the twenty-two deficiencies are not enacted by April 1, 1981, or if the one statutory deficiency Is not corrected by October-I, 1981. This conditional approval is effective November 21, 1980. Beginning on that date, the Missouri Land Reclamation Commission shall be deemed the regulatory authority in Missouri and all Missouri surface coal mining and reclamation operations on non-Federal, and non-Indian lands and all coal explorations on non-Federal and non- Indian lands in Missouri shall be subject to the permanent regulatory program. In compliance with the order of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, May 10, 1980, the Secretary affirmatively disapproves the regulations as listed below in 30 CFR Section 925.10(b). On non-Federal and non-Indian lands in Missouri, the permanent regulatbry program consists of the State program approved by the Secretary. On Federal lands, the permanent regulatory program consists of the Federal rules made applicable under 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter D-Parts 740-745. Missouri and the Department of the Interior will have the opportunity to enter into a State/Federal Cooperative Agreement to include the requirements of the approved Missouri permanent regulatory program on Federal lands. The Secretary's approval of the Missouri program relates at this time only to the permanent regulatory program under Title V of SMCRA. The approval does not constitute approval of any provisions related to implementation of Title IV under SMCRA, the abandoned mine lands reclamation program. In accordance -with 30 CFR Part 884, Missouri may submit a State Reclamation Plan now that its permanent program has been approved. At the time of such a submission, all provisions relating to abandoned mined lands reclamation will be reviewed by officials of the Department of the Interior. Additional Findings The Secretary has determined that, pursuant to Section 702(d) of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1292(d), no environmental impact statement need be prepared on this conditional approval. The Secretary has determined that this document is not a significant rule Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations under E.O. 12004 or 43 CFR Part 14, and no regulatory analysis is being prepared on this conditional approval.

Federal legister / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations 77029 SUmEARY: This final rule amends the Private Express regulations to permit payment of postage on privately shipped letters by means other than those which are presently required, provided that the alternative means are set out in a written agreement with the Postal Service. This new rule is intended to permit the development of alternative payment procedures that can be tailored to the needs of the individual shippers while also ensuring that the Postal Service receives the revenue to which it is entitled. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 22,1980. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Jerry Belenker, (202) 245-4616. suPPLEMENTARY IFORMATioN: On September 12,1980, the Postal Service propO~ed (45 FR 60453] a rule which would permit persons who ship or carry letters outside the mails, under circumstances requiring payment of postage, to enter into agreements specifying methods of payment which differ from those contained in 39 U.S.C. 601(a) (1)-{6) and 39 CR 310.2(b) (1)-{6). The existing rule requires that- (1) The letter be enclosed in an envelope or other suitable cover, (2) the postage be paid by stamps, or postage meter stamps, on the cover or by other methods approved by the Postal Service: (3) a name and address appear on the cover, (4) the cover be sealed; (5) stamps be canceled in ink by the sender, and (6) the date of the letter, or of its transmission or receipt by the carrier, be endorsed by the sender or carrier. The proposal was intended to authorize payment of postage in ways (which may differ from one firm to another) that are more convenient than the existing procedures, while ensuring that the Postal Service receives the revenue to which it is entitled under the Private Express Statutes. No comments on the proposal were received. Accordingly, the Postal Service hereby adopts, without change, the following revision of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations: In \u00a7 310.2 revise paragraph (b] to read as follows: PART 310-ENFORCEMENT OF THE PRIVATE EXPRESS STATUTES \u00a7 310.2 Unlawful carriage of letters (b) activity described in paragraph (a) of this section is lawful with respect to a letter if- (1) (i) The letter is enclosed in an envelope or other suitable cover;, (ii) The amount of postage which would have been charged on the letter ifit had been sent through the Postal Service is paid by stamps, or postage meter stamps, on the cover or by other methods approved by the Postal Service; (iii) The name and address of the person for whom the letter is intended appear on the cover, (iv) The cover is so sealed that the letter cannot be taken from it without defacing the cover, (v) Any stamps on the cover are canceled in ink by the sender, and (vi) The date of the letter, or of its transmission or receipt by the carrier, is endorsed on the cover in ink by the sender or carrier, as appropriate; or (2) fi) The activity is in accordance with the terms of a written agreement between the shipper or the carrier of the letter and the Postal Service. Such an agreement may include some or all of the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. or it may change them, but it must- (A) Adequately ensure payment of an amount equal to the postage to which the Postal Service would have been entitled had the letters been carried in the mail; (B) Remain in effect for a specified period (subject to renewals); and (C) Provide for periodic review, audit and inspection. (ii) Possible alternative arrangements may include but are not limited to-- (A) Payment of a fixed sum at specified intervals based on the shipper's projected shipment of letters for a given period, as verified by the Postal Service; or (B) Utilization of a computer record to determine the volume of letters shipped during an interval and the applicable postage to be remitted to the Postal Service.

Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. E-351, 401 M St. SV., Washington, D.C. 20460, (202-755-1397), SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA issued a notice that was published in the Federal Register on December 5,1978 (43 FR 56935) that E. L du Pont de Nemours & Co., Wilmington. DE 19898, had submitted a pesticide petition (PP 8FZ119) which proposed that 40 CFR Part 180 be amended by establishing a tolerance for residues of the herbicide hexazinone [3-cyclohexyl-6- (dimethylamino)--methyl-1,3,5-triazine- 2,4,(1H,3M-dione] and its metabolities (calculated as the parent compound) in or on sugarcane with a tolerance limitation of 0.2 ppm. No comments were received in response to this notice of filing. The data submitted in this petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. The data included metabolism studies in plants and lactating goats; plant residue studies; a rat acute oral with a LD% of 1,690 milligrams (mg)/kilogram Ckg]; a guinea pig acute oral ID,. study a LDa of 860 mg/kg; a 90-day rat feadin3 study with a no-observable-effect-level (NOEL) of 1.0 ppm; a 90-day dog f-eding study with a NOEL of 1,003) ppm; a rat teratology study which shawad that the compound was not t3ratogenfc at 5.000 ppm (highest level tasted] a rabbit tcratolo.g, study with a NOEL of 125 rg/kg (highest level tested) for teratolopy; a two-year rat chronic feeding/oncogenicity study with a NOEL of 200 ppm and no oncogenic effects; a rat 3-generation reproduction study with a NOEL of .500 ppm for adverse reproductive effects: and an Ames test negative for mutagenic activity. 77030 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations An oncogenicity study in a secondspecies and a 6-month (or longer) non-rodent feeding study are lacking. Furthexclarification of the metabolism ofhexazinone in animals-is also required in order to reinforce the present findings. E. 1. du Pont de Nemours & Co.has agreed to submit a mouse oncogenicity study by February 1981,and to conduct and submit a non-rodent feeding study and a metabolism studyby January 1982, and agreed towithdraw this tolerance If these studiesindicate a potentially significant adverse finding. There are no permanent tolerances forhexazinone. Based on the 90-day dogsubchronic feeding study with a NOELof 1,000 ppm and.a safety factor of 2,000,the acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.0125 mg/kg/day and the maximalpermitted intake (MPI) is 0.75 mg/day per 60 kg person. The requestedtolerance will utilize 1.46 percent of the ADI. There are no regulatory actions pending against registration of thischemical. The metabolism of hexazinone in plants is adequately understood andan analytical method (nitrogen selectivegas chromatography) is available for enforcement purposes. There is a labelrestriction against the feeding of sugarcane forage to livestock, and sinceno detectable residues are expected inother sugarcane byproduct feed items,there is no reasonable expectation ofresidues in meat, fat, meat byproducts, eggs, and milk. The pesticide is considered useful forthe purpose for which the tolerance isbeing sought, and it is concluded thatthe tolerance of 0.2 ppm in or onsugarcane will protect the public health. It is concluded, therefore, that thetolerance lte established as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this.regulation may, by December 22, 1980,file written objections with the Hearing Clerk, EPA, Rm. M-3708 (A-110), 401 MSt. SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. Suchobjections should be submitted inquintuplicate and specify the provisions of the regulation deemed to beobjectionable and the grounds for theobjections. If a hearing is requested, theobjections must state the issues for thehearing. A hearing will be granted if theobjections are supported by grounds legally sufficient to justify the relief sought. Under Executive Order 12044, EPA isrequired to judge whether a regulation is\"significant\" and therefore subject to theprocedural requirements of the Order or \"whether it may follow other specializeddevelopment procedures. EPA labels these other regulations \"specialized.\"This regulation has been reviewed and has been determined that it is a specialized regulation not subject to the-procedural requirements of Executive Order 12044.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA issued a notice that published in the Federal Register of September 2, 1980 (45 FR 58193) that BASF Wyandotte Corporation, 100 Cherry Hill Road, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054 had submitted a pesticide petition (PPOE2380). This petition proposed that 40 CFR 180 be amended by the establishment of a tolerance for combined residues of the fungicide 3- (3,5-dichlorophenyl)-5-ethenyl-5.methyl. 2,4 oxazolidinedione and its moiety resulting from preharvest application inor on the raw agricultural commodity kiwifruit at 10 ppm. No comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee were received in response tothis notice of filing. The data submitted in the petition andother relevant materials have been evaluated. The toxicological data considered in support of the tolerance included a mouse teratology study, a three-generation rat reproduction study, a chronic feeding oncogenic study inrats, a chronic feeding oncogenic-study in mice, a dominant lethal assay In mice, a repeated oral dosing metabolism study in rats, a 90-day rat study, and a g-day dog study. Based on a 90-day dog study,, the no-observed-effect level (NOEL) is 300 ppm, or 7.5 mg/kg of body weight (bw) per day. Using a 2,000-fold safety factor, an acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.0038 mg/kg of bw/day and a maximum permissible intake (MPI) is 0.2550 mg/day for a 60 kg person. The tolerance results in a maximum theoretical exposure of 0.0045 mg/day for a 1.5 kg diet. The tolerance utilizes 2.0 percent of the ADI. No tolerances have previously been established for residues of 3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl).S. ethenyl-5-methyl-2,4-oxazolldinedione, An adequate analytical method (gas chromatolgraphy using arn electron capture detector) is available for enforcement purposes. Assurance has been given that 3-(3,5- dichlorophenyl)-5-ethenyl-5-methyl-2,4 oxazolidinedione) for use on kiwifrult will be regulated by the country of originin accordance with use patterns used indeveloping the supporting residue data, The proposed tolerance is adequate tocover residues in or on kiwifruit.

L. 91-448 (October 14, 1980) created a new section, 49 U.S.C. 11344 (e) which permits under certain circumstances anapplication to be filed for motor carrier transportation prior or subsequent to rail transportation. We are adopting interim rules under this section which indicate (1) the type of application which must be filed with the Commission to receive special interm6dal authority, (2) iyho must file the application, (3) upon-whom the application must be served, (4) how the application can be protested, (5) the action the Commission will take. on such applications, and (6) the means by which interested parties can show that the special intermodal authority should be revoked. DATES: These interim rules shall be effective on November 18, 1980. Comments upon these rules are due on or before December 22, 1980. ADDRESSES: An original and 15 copies of comments, if possible, should be sent to Ex Parte No. 282 (Sub-No. 7), Room 6414, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, D.C. 20423. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ellen Hanson, (202) 275-7245 or Wayne Michel, (202) 275-7960. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The addition of 49 U.S.C. 11344(e) by the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 permits a rail carrier, or a person controlled by or affiliated with a rail carrier, together with one or more affected shippers, to apply for special intermodal authority. This authority would allow applicants to provide motor carrier transportation prior or subsequent to rail transportation to serve inadequately Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations 77033 served shippers located on a rail line other than that of the applicant carrier. The special intermodal authority would be for an indefinite duration and would apply to anyone located on the inadequately served line. The rules contained in the appendix adopt procedures for the Commission to handle these proceedings. There are five basic sections in these rules. They cover- (1] The contents of the application, (2) notification of the public of the application through service on designated interested parties and concurrent newspaper publication of a notice, (3) protests to the application, (4) the Commission's action on an application, and (5) petitions by interested parties to show that the circumstances requiring special intermodal authority no longer exist. The rules provide that an original and five copies of the application must be filed on the Commission. The applioation must contain certain information identifying the applicants and the carrier which will be providing the service. In addition, applicants must file verified statements demonstrating presently impaired rail service and inadequate motor common carrier service which results in the serious failure of the rail carrier serving the shippers to meet the rail equipment or transportation schedules of shippers or which otherwise seriously fail to provide adequate normal rail service required by shippers which shippers would reasonably expect the rail carrier to provide. These statements should specifically detail: (1] The nature, duration and extent of the impaired rail service, (2) the reasons why motor common carrier service to shippers is inadequate, and (3) the rail equipment and transportation schedule needs of the shipper(s). Shipper certification that existing rail and motor common carrier service is inadequate will create a rebuttable presumption that special intermodal authority is necessary and should be granted. Applications may only be filed by a rail carrier, or a person controlled by or affiliated with a rail carrier, together with one or more affected shippers. At the same time as the application is filed with the Commission a copy must be served on the carrier(s) providing the allegedly impaired rail service and the designated State agency(s) in which the property is located. In addition, on or before the filing date, a notice must be published in a local newspaper of general circulation setting forth (1) the names and addresses of the applicants, and, if different, the person(s) providingthe special Intermodal service, (2) the location of the rail line with impaired service, and (3) the procedure for filing protest with the Commission. The original and five copies of protests in the form of sworn statements must be filed %ith the Commission within 10 days of the filing of the application. The Commission is required by the statute to act on these applications within 30 days. If no protest is filed, the Commission shall approve the application. If the application for special intermodal authority is protested, the Commission shall either approve or disapprove it by the 30th day after its filing. The Commission's grant of the application for special intermodal authority will take effect immediately, and will run until revoked by request of the applicants. If any other party believes that the special authority is no longer warranted it should petition the Commission to revoke the authority. Petitioner(s) will have the burden of proving that the original circumstances warranting the special authority no longer exist. An original and five copies of the petition must be filed with the Commission and copies must be served concurrently on applicants. Applicants will have 30 days to respond to the petition to revoke the special authority. After reviewing the petition(s) and response(s), the Commission will issue an order either revoking the special intermodal authority or denying the petition. These rules will be used by the Commission on an interim basis. The Commission is faced with an impractical situation in which the due and required execution of the agency functions would be prevented by undertaking a rulemaking prior to the adoption of any rules. Thus, notice and comment for these interim rules are not required under 5 U.S.C. 553{b)(B). Public comments are invited on these interim rules as a basis for final rules. The original and 15 copies of written facts, views, and arguments concerning the proposal detailed in this notice shall be submitted. The proposal may be modified by the comments we receive. We shall act as quickly as possible in formulating final rules. The rules in the appendix are proposed pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 11344(e) and 5 553.By is added to read as follows: 11111.11 Special intermodal authority. (a) Application--{1 T Who may file.

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service 7 CFR Part 726 Burley Tobacco; 1981 National Marketing Quotas for Burley Tobacco AGENCY:. Agrictltural Stabilization and Conservation Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Secretary of Agriculture must announce by February 1,1981, the national marketing quotas for barley tobacco for the 1981-82 marketing year. The public is invited to comment on the amount of the national marketing quota and other factors set forth in this proposed rule. DATE: Written comments must be received by January 21,1981 in order to be sure of consideration. ADDRESSES:. Send comments to the Director, Price Support and Loan Division, ASCS, U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, D.C. 20013. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Robert L Tarczy, Program Specialist. Price Support and Loan Division, ASCS, Room 3754 South Building, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, D.C. 20013, (202) 447- 6733. The draft impact analysis describing the options considered in developing this proposed rule and the impact of implementing each option is available on request from Robert L Tarczy. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION. This proposed rule has been reviewed under USDA procedures established to implement Executive Order 12044 and has been classified \"significanL\" In compliance with Secretary's Memorandum No. 1955 and \"Improving USDA Regulations\" (43 FR 50988) it is determined after review of these and related regulations contained in 7 CFR 726.2 for need, currency, clarity, and effectiveness that no additional changes be proposed at this time. Any commentswhich are offered during the public comment period on any of these regulations, however, will Le evaluated in development of the final rule. The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program that this Proposed Rule applies to is: Title-Commudity Loan and Purchases; Number-o051. This action will not have significant impact specifically on area and community development. Therefore, review as established by OMB Circular A-95 was not used to assure that units of local Government are informed of this action. The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938. as amended (referred to herein as the \"Act\") requires the Secretary to determine and announce the amount of the national marketing quota for the 1981-82 marketing year. Section 319(b) of the Act provides that this action shall be taken on or before February 1,1981. Section 319(c) of the Act provides that the national marketing quota determined under this section for burley tobacco for any marketing year shall be the amount produced in the United States which the Secretay estimates will be utilized in the United States and will be exported during such marketing year, adjusted upward or downward in such amount as the Secretary, in his discretion, determines is desirable for the purpose of maintaining an adequate supply or for effecting an orderly reduction of supplies to the reserve supply level. Any such downward adjustment shall not exceed 5 per centum of such estimated utilization and exports. For each marketing year for which marketing quotas are in effect under this section. the Secretary in his discretion may establish a reserve (hereinafter referred to as the \"national reserve\") from the national marketing quota in an amount not in excess of 1 per centum of the national marketing quota to be available for making corrections and adjusting inequities in farm marketing quotas, and for establishing marketing quotas for new farms (that is, farms for which farm marketing quotas are not otherwise established). A reserve of 800,000 pounds was established for the 190-81 marketing year (45 FR 8578). Section 301(b) of the Act defines \"Reserve supply level\" as normal supply plus 5 percent. \"Normal supply\" is defined as a normal year's domestic consumption and exports, plus 175percent of a normal year's domestic consumption ard 65 percent of a normal year's domestic consumption\" is defined as the yearly average quantity produced in the United States during the ten marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year in which such consumption is determined, adjusted for current trends in such consumption. A \"Normal year's exports\" is defined as the yearly average quantity produced in the United States which was exported from the United States during the ten marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year in which such exports are determined, adjusted for current trends in such exports. The reserve supply level used in determining the national marketing quota for the 1980-81 marketing year was 1,640 million pounds, calculated from a normal year's domestic consumption of 490 million pounds and a normal year's exports of 130 million pounds (45 FR 8578). The proposed reserve supply level for use in determining the national marketing quota for the 1981-82 marketing year is 1,678 million pounds, calculated from a normal years domestic consumption of 500 million pounds and a normal year's exports of 135 million pounds. Section 301(b) of the Act defines \"total supply\" as the carryover at the beginning of the marketing year (October 1) plus the estimated production in the United States during the calendar year in which the marketing year begins. The total supply for the 1980-81 marketing year is 555 million pounds based on carryover of 1,028 million pounds and estimated production of 1,583 million pounds. The amount of the national marketing quota for the 1980-81 marketing year is 615 million pounds based upon total utilization of 615 million pounds with no adjustments necessary to maintain or reduce supplies (45 FR 8578). For the 1981-82 marketing year, utilization in the United States is estimated to be about 490 million pounds and exports are estimated to be about 140 million pounds. The total supply for the 1980-1 marketing year is 95 million pounds less than the proposed reserve supply level. Accordingly a downward adjustment in estimated disappearance in the 1981 quota Is determined unlikely. Section 319(e) of the Act provides, in part, that each farm marketing quota shall be determined by multiplying the Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules previous year's farm marketing quota b3 a national factor obtained by dividing the national marketing quota determined under subsection 319(c) (les! the national reserve] by the sum of the farm marketing quotas for the immediately preceding year for all farmn for which burley tobacco marketing quotas will be determined: Provided, that such national factor shall not be lese than 95 per centum. Section 319(i) o the Act provides, in part, that if the Secretary, in his discretoh, determines it is desirable to encourage-additional marketings of any grades-of burley tobacco during any marketing year to insure traditional marketing patterns to meet the normal demands of export and domestic markets, he may authorize the marketing of such grades without the payment of penalty or deduction from subsequent quotas to the extent of 5 per centum of the farm marketing quota for the farm on which the tobacco was produced, and such marketings shall be eligible for price support. Section 319(h) of the Act provides tha effective with the marketing year beginning October 1, 1976, no marketing quota, other than a new farm marketing quota, shall be established for a farm on which no burley tobacco was planted or considered planted in any of the five years immediately preceding the year, for whtch farm marketing quotas are being established. Proposed Rule The subjects and issues involved in the proposed determinations with respect to burley tobacco for the 1981-8 marketing year are: 1. The amount of national marketing quota, 2. The amount of the reserve supply level S. The amount of the national reserve. 4. Whether the Secretary should implemen the provision in section 319(i) of the Act to encourage additional marketings of any grades to insure traditional marketing patterns. The national factor is not considered. an issue in these determinations because it results from a mathematical computation under section 319(e).of the Act.

Background Executive Order 12044. \"ImprovIng Government Regulations,\" (43 FR 12661] in part directs each Executive Agency to adopt procedures to improve and periodically review its existing regulations. In response, the Department of Agriculture issued Secretary's Memorandum 1955, \"Improving USDA Decisions and Regulations.\" This departmental memorandum implemented the President's prescribed measures for improving the Federal Government's rules and regulations by establishing procedures designed to minimize unnecessary burdens on the public while achieving maximum effectiveness in all decisions including rulemaking and regulatory review processes. Public participation was noted to be an important source for obtaining ideas and information to better serve the public in this undertaking. All agencies were, therefore, directed to solicit actively public comment and to obtain the greatest possible public input. Furthermore, each USDA agency was to develop a plan to assure that regulations which have existed more than 5 years would be reviewed. Pursuant to these directives, the Administrator, FSQS. has adopted a plan for the review of existing regulations and has appointed a Regulatory Review Task Force to conduct such review. The FSQS plan covers the entire review process and includes a detailed discussion of the following categories: (1) Background and Requirements for the Review, (2) Regulations Subject to the Review, (3) Review Criteria and Priorities, (4] Public Comment and Organization. and (5] Schedule for Review of Existing Regulations. A copy of the plan is available for public inspection in the office of the Regulations Coordination Division during regular hours of business. The Regulatory Review Task Force is responsible for.77037 Federal Register / VoL 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules 1. Coordinating the overall review. 2.

Setting a schedule and monitoring operations within this schedule. 5. Establishing the priority for reviewing allAgency regulations. 6. Certifying to the Administrator and Assistant Secretary that each regulation has been, thoroughly reviewed within the guidelines of Executive Order 12044 and Secretary's Memorandum 1955. 7. Recommending a \"Significant\" or \"Not determined to be Significant\" designation. 8. Establishing a date for the next review of the regulation. 9. Other related duties. As the FSQS Task Force commences its review of specific sections of Agency regulations, the Department will publish a notice in the Federal Register inviting public comments on those particular regulations to be reviewed. This Prenotice The Task Force is reviewing the regulations for the voluntary inspection of egg products and grading, the voluntary grading of shell eggs and U.S. standards, grades and weight classes for shell eggs, the mandatory inspectionof eggs and egg products and-the voluntary grading of poultry products and rabbit products (7 CFR Parts 2855, 2858, 2859, and 2870). The Department is\" inviting comments from consumers, the-industry, Federal, State,.and local agencies, and other Interested parties to assist the-Task Force in identifying and reconsidering those portions of the aforementioned regulations which: 1. Present consumer concerns with respect to health and food safety. 2. Impose unnecessary burdens on the public or industry. 3. Are not consistent'with legislative goals. 4. Are difficult to-enforce, i.e., those found inefficient inu-achieving the intended results. 5. Indicate unnecessary overlapping jurisdiction with other Government agencies. I - 6. Are unclear, difficult to understand,. or are duplicative of, or inconsistent with, other regulations. ' 7. May be improved by use of new scientific and technological innovations. All comments received will be carefully considered by the FSQS' Regulations Review Task Force. In the event that it appears changesin the existing regulatibns are necessary, amendments will be proposed in theFederal Register in confofmance with established rulemaking procedures.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Significance The proposal was reviewed under USDA procedures established in Secretary's Memorandum No. 1955 to implement ExecutiveOrder 12044, and has bqen classified\"bignificant.\" Background. On March 21, 1980, the Food Safety and Quality Service piblished a proposal to amend the United States Standards for Gradei of Major Canned Fruits. The proposed amendment, included standaids for canned sweet cherries, canned fruit cocktail, cannedpears, canned apricots, and canned grapes; all major canned fruits packed In California. Also included is a proposal for a new United States Standards for Grades of Canned Fruit Mix. Interested persons were given until-December 12, 1980, to comment. The Agency has been requested by the Canners League of California to extend the period of time within which data, views, or arguments may be submitted to December 12, 1981. The request stated that additional time was needed to develop comments which will accurately reflect the manufacturing practices of the industry. Since the Agency is interested in receiving meaningful data, the Agency has determinedthat these circumstances are considered sufficient justification for extending the comment period to December 12, 1981.

NOAA will establish appropriate safeguards against unwarranted disclosure of confidential information. Ill. Proposed and Final Rules NOAA will issue proposed rules to implement the Act after comments received in response to this ANPR have been evaluated. NOAA plans to issue the proposed rules in March 1981, and final rules in July 1981. NOAA plans to hold public hearings on the proposed rules, and on a draft environmental impact statement concerning this rulemaking, in April 1981. IV. Regulatory Issues, and Possible Alternative Approaches A. General Background OTEC facilities and plantships (a plantship is basically an OTEC facility that floats unmoored or moves through the water will produce electric power. or energy-intensive products, by using the thermal differential between warm ocean surface waters and cold, deep (approximately 1.000 meters waters.The OTEC principle can be applied most economically in areas where the thermal differential between surface and deep waters in about 20' C or more. This makes the most probable U.S. locations for OTEC facilities or plantships in the Gulf of Mexico area and the southeastern continental United States and the island areas under U.S. jurisdiction, such as the State of Hawaii. the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa. The electricity generated could be transmitted to shore by cable and then distributed via normal electric distribution grids. The energy also could be used at sea to produce ammonia, aluminum, or other products which would be transported to shore by conventional marine transportation methods. U.S. plantships could operate in a number of areas on the high seas. The industry is in a formative stage at present because, although the basic principles of OTEC power generation have been tested, the hardware, engineering, and operational requirements of commercial-scale OTEC operations have not yet been fully developed and will require substantial capital investments of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. The Act is intended, among other things. to: (1) Establish a stable legal structure to encourage private industry to develop OTEC as a commercial energy technology; (2] protect the marine and coastal environment and the interests of other users of the territorial sea, continental shelf and high seas, and foreign nations that may be affected by discharges from an OTEC facility or plantship; and (3) ensure that Federal OTEC-related actions are consistent with approved State coastal zone management plans. The Act authorizes the Administrator of NOAA to license (and requires persons to obtain licenses prior to] the construction, location, ownership and operation of: (1) OTEC facilities connected to the United States by pipeline or cable: (2) OTEC facilities located in the territorial sea of the United States. (3] OTEC plantships documented under the laws of the United States; and (4) OTEC plantships that are constructed, owned or operated by United States citizens. The Act requires NOAA to issue regulations for the licensing of these OTEC facilities and plantships. NOAA has a major responsibility for enforcing the Act and its implementing regulations. The Coast Guard is77039 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No.. 227 / Friday November 21, 1980 / Proposed, Rules responsible for enforcement ofmeasures for safety of life.uandproperty at sea.. B. Alternative 11gulatory Approaches Under Consideration NOAA is just beginning its-rulemaking process to implement the Act. In- developing OTECliensing-and- enforcement regulations, NOAA will address a wide variety of issues, including, for example: (1) The- amount' and type of financial, technical, environmental and other information that an applicant must submit with an application; (2] criteria for selecting a\"winning\" OTEC facility (or combination of facilities] when there are multiple applicants for the same geographic area; (3] environmental safeguards, including environmental monitoring requirements; and (4) the prevention of interference by one OTEC' facility or plantship with another, with other users of the territorial sea, Continental Shelf and high seas, and with foreign nations. In identifying and evaluating alternatives for the development of OTEC regulations for each of these general areas, NOAA first would define the basic objective for each, and then evaluate alternative approaches. For example, three'general approaches would be for NOAA to: (1) Address these areas in:substantial detail, in its regulatibns, providing specific terms that would apply to all OTEC operations. If experience later revealed that detailed and extensive requirements were unnecessary, NOAA could reduce them on a- case-by-case basis, (2) Address an area in more general terms in its regulations, and- then! developindividualized license terms, conditions, andrestrictions based on the. specific OTEC facility or plantbhip design and site characteristics associated with each license application. (3) Employ less detailed requirements in both the regulations and the terms, conditions, and restrictions for each OTEC license, and rely on the subsequent monitoring specified in the Act to ascertain whether additional requirements are needed in the future. In considering alternative approaches to these regulations, NOAA will assess the feasibility of relying ontechniques which may allow more flexibilityifor OTEC builders, owners, and operators while still accomplishing the purposes and meeting the requirements of the Act and providingadequate guidance to prospective OTEC designers and-users. For instance, NOAA may be. able to rely on general environmental performance standards orparameters, rather than,specifyingfdetailedzequiiements concerning use.of specified types of equipment or specified operating procedures. NOAA also may provide generalized-guidance in.its regulations for meeting the requirements of the Act, but then allow the applicant to identify in detail in-its application how it will meet these requirements. Once NOAA issued a license under this approach, NOAA would expect the OTEC builder, owner or operator to conduct its activities according to the terms of its application. NOAA will consider impacts on small business from the regulations. C.'Issues NOAA invites comment on the merits of applying the above alternative regulatory approaches (and any other approaches that commenters may suggest) to the issues discussed below and to any other regulatory issues arising under the Act. Several of the issues upon which NOAA seeks comment raise questions concerning potential overlaps in the roles and areas of jurisdiction of different Federal agencies. Although the Act gives NOAA the lead role in licensing OTEC facilities and plantships and in enforcing applicable legal reqtlirements, there is potential overlapping jurisdiction among NOAA, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Coast Guard. (See, for example, the following Issues: No. 1, No. 3, No.,10, No. 14, No. 15- No. 16, and No. 17.1 NOAAwelcomes suggestions on how potential overlaps may best be avoided in administering the.Act. NOAA!s initial views on how to approach certain issues are provided below. These initial views should not be interpreted tofbe NOAA's final decision, on how to address particular issues. Unless otherwise noted, section numbers refer to the Act. The-Applibation and License Process Issue No., 1: Information to be Submitted withan Application, ' What types and detail of financial,. technical and other information should NOAA's regulations require an applicant to include in an, application, for a license? (See section. 102(d)(2).) For example: (1) What information is necessary or appropriate.to the findings the Attorney General-must make under \u00a7 104 concerning creation of situations inconsistent.with the antitrust laws? (2) What information pertinent to granting.offinancial assistance under Title XI of the Merchant-Marine Act of 1936 shouldbe submitted, along with.anapplication for a NOAA license, and what pertinent information should not be submitted until the time an applicant actually applies to the Marltime Administration for Title XI assistance? (See Title It of the Act.) (3) What information is necessary or appropriate to the exercise of NOAA's environmental protection responsibilities under the Act? Initil NOAA View NOAA intends, as a general policy, to minimize the information required in a license application, consistent with the requirements of the Act. IssUe No. 2: Amount of Application Feo (a) What application fee should NOAA charge persons applying for initial issuance of an OTEC license? (See section 102(h).) (b) What application fee should NOAA charge persons applying for transfer or renewal of an OTEC license? InitialNOAA View (a) NOAA has not formulated an initial view regarding the appropriate application fee to cover administrative costs of reviewing and processing an application for initial issuance of a license. NOAAnotes that the fee charged by the Coast Guard for a Deepwater Port license application under a similar statute is $100,000, plus reimbursement to the government for processing costs above that amount (See 33'CFR 148.107). (b) NOAA has not formulated an initial view regarding the appropriate fee for the transfer or renewal of an OTEC license. Issue No. 3: \"One-Stop\"Application and Licensing Process / What role should NOAA play with respect to facilitating the appropriate, timely revieW, by other Federal (and, If appropriate, State and local) agencies of an application for licensing of an OTEC facility or plantship? (See section 101(c)(1), section 101(c)(4), section 101(d](1), and section 102(fl.) Initial NOAA View The Act states that an application filed with NOAA shall constitute an application for all Federal authorizations required for ownership, construction, and operation of an OTEC facility or plantship, except for authorizations administered by the Coast Guard. However, the Act does not explicitly state the role which NOAA Is to play with respect to other agencies after ithas sent copies of an application to them. NOAA has not formulated an77040 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 19&0 / Proposed Rules initial view on the degree of facilitation or coordination which is appropriate. Issue No.4: 'Land-based\" OTEC Facilities What special regulatory provisions, or exceptions from the general licensing and enforcement regulations, are appropriate for OTEC facilities which are located, in part, on land? Initial NOAA View NOAA has not formulated an initial view on this issue. Review of Applications Issue No. 5: Adjacent Coastal States Should additional, or more detailed, criteria be established to guide the determination of \"adjacent coastal states\" under section 105(a)(2) of the Act, or are the criteria specified in section 105(a)2) appropriately comprehensive and specific? Initial NOAA.View NOAA has not formulated an initial view on this issue. Issue No.& Opportunities for Public Participation Should additional opportunities for public review of OTEC license applications be established in NOAA's licensing procedures, or are the statutory requirements for public hearings and an environmental impact statement on each application sufficient means for public participation? (See section 102, especially section 102(g), and section 107(e).) In'tial NOAA View NOAA believes the public review provisions in the Act provide ample opportunity for public participation in the consideration of each application for an OTEC license. However, NOAA will consider additional means of enhancing the public's role in review of applications if commenters can suggest a way to accomplish this objective without incurring significant additional expense or delay in the application review process. Approval or Disapproval of an Application Issue No. 7\" 'The National Interest\" What criteria and procedures should NOAA use to determine whether a license application is or is not \"in the national interest and consistent with national security, and other national policy goals and objectives, including energy self-sufficiency and environmental quality\", a determination required by section 101(c)(2)?InitialNOAA View NOAA believes that any regulations on this issue ultimately must provide some flexibility for the Administrator of NOAA to judge the merits of each license application. Some additional guidance regarding illustrative factors to consider when making this \"national interest\" determination may be derived from: (1) Section 2 of the Act, entitled \"Declaration of Policy\"; (2) section 102(i)(3) of the Act, relating to decision criteria when multiple applications are received for the same site; and (3) from section 2 of Pub. L 96-310 (the Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Research, Development, and Demonstration Act), which states the findings and purposes of the Congress in enacting Pub, L 96- 310. Issue No. & Multiple Applications for Same Site Should NOAA's licensing regulations elaborate on the Act's criteria for choosing between two or more applications to locate an OTEC facility at the same site? (See section 102(i)(3).) What criteria or factors should NOAA use in specifying the geographic bounds of the \"application area\" encompassing the site proposed in an application for an OTEC facility? (See section 102(e)(1) and section 3(17).) InitialNOAA View NOAA has not formulated initial views on these issues. General Requirements Applicable to Licensees Issue No. 9: Diligence What standards would be appropriate regarding the duty of a licensee to pursue diligently the construction and operation of an OTEC facility or plantship for which he has received a license? For example, should NOAA require applicmtis to specify construction and opeation schedules In their application which would become conditions of the license? (See section 106.) Initial NOAA View NOAA believes that diligence standards should apply to all licenses issued (for example, to preclude efforts by speculators to secure rights to highly desirable OTEC sites if the speculators do not plan promptly to use the site's thermal resource). NOAA has not formulated an initial view regarding the specific content of such diligence standards.Issue No. 10.- Reports and Records What type of reports and records should NOAA require a licensee to maintain and submit? (See section 112.) Initial NO.14 View NOAA believes that although such requirements should be minimized. licensees should be required to maintain records regarding environmental quality, the electricity or other product production on the OTEC facility or plantship, any significant changes in the composition of ownership of the OTEC facility or plantship, and other subjects to be determined during this rulemaking. Issue No. 11. Removal of Components What bonding requirements should NOAA establish to assure the appropriate disposal or removal of OTEC facility or plantsbip components upon the termination, revocation, relinquishment, or surrender of a license? (See J 101(dj(3).) Initial NOAA View NOAA has not formulated an initial view on this issue. Issue No. 12 Confidentiality Should NOAA establish special criteria or procedures concerning confidentiality of certain types of trade secrets or commercial or financial informalion reported to or collected by the NOAA Administrator under the Act? Alternatively;are the Act's restrictions upon the Administrator's release of information that is exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552{b)[4) sufficiently clear that NOAA need not issue regulations to detail the Act's protections against disclosure? (See section 112(b), and 15 CFR Part 903, NOAA's \"Public Information\" and Freedom of Information Act regulations.) Initial NOAA IYew NOAA has not formulated an initial view on this issue. Environmental Safeguards; Avoidance of Use Conflicts Issue No. 13: Site Evaluation and Preconsruction Testing Should NOAA issue regulations governing site evaluation and pre- construction testing activities at potential OTEC facility or plantship locations? If the commenter believes NOAA should issue such regulations, should the regulations be issued before, contemporaneously with, or after NOAA's general licensing regulations? (See section 102(b).)77041 7 Federal Register / Vol: 45, No. 227 ] Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules InitlaiNOAA ViewNOAA believes that some information that might be gathered from OTEC industy participants conducting site evaluation and other at-sea activities couldbe useful in augmenting the information currently available for use in preparing the environmental impact statement on NOAA's general licensing regulations. However, the agency's issuance of siteevaluation and preconstruction testing regulations would achieve this objective only if industry actually will be conducting such activities during the next year or SO. -Issue No. 14. EnvironmentalProtection Measures - What types of environmental protection measures should be applied, 'as license conditions or by regulation, to the operation of OTEC facilities aid plantships? (See section 1061(d)(1) and 101(g).) How should they relate to EPA's requirements under the National PollutantDischarge Elimination System (NPDES)? InitialNOAA View NOAA could consider certain types of environmental protection measures for inclusion in its licensing regulations as \"generc' 6r \"across the board\" requirements applicable to all OTEC facilities and plantships. Such measures might include requirements that: (1) Any submarine electrical transmission cable or product pipeline be buried; (2) the discharge waters be mixed and discharged through a single outfall structure; (3) the discharge structure(s) be located at a specified depth below the surface (e.g., at the thermocline or pycnocline); or (4) specified anti- biofouling chemicals or procedures be used. Such requirements would be established only if supported by appropriate evidence. Such - requirements probably would require site-specific and design-specific \"fine- tuning\" through attachment of precise conditions to each license issued for an OTEC facility or.plantship. Issue No. 15: EnvironmentalMonitoring What specific types of environmental monitoring should NOAA require of each licensee, and how frequently should NOAA require submission of such monitoring reports? (See section 110(3).) How should NOAA's , requirements under the NPDES program? InitialNOAA View NOAA's initial view is that a licensee should be required to implement an'oceanographic and environmental monitoring program to meet at least the following objectives: (1) Demonstration of compliance with applicable State, Federal, or other pertinent water quality standards; (2) early detection of potential releases from the OTEC facility or plantship of toxic or hazardous substances; and (3) monitoring of the effects of the discharge plume. Issue No. 16: Criteria for Immediate Suspension What criteria should NOAA apply in determining whether to suspend construction or operation of an OTEC facility or plantship immediately in order to protect public health and safety or to eliminate an imminent and substantial danger to the environment? (See section 111(b).) Alternatively, what advantages or disadvantages may accrue in administerig'NOAA's enforcement responsibilities under the Act if NOAA chooses not to elaborate in regulations upon the standards provided in section111(b)? Initial NOAA View NOAA has not fdrniiIated an initial view on this issue. Issue No. 17 Prevention of Interference with Other Ocean-Users, and-Other Nations (a) What types of OTEC-related interference with other legitimate users of the ocean and with other nations' territorial seas or natural resource jurisidiction zones should NOAA seek to prevent? (For example, interference could arise from the thermal characteristics of the plume affecting the local ocean environment, or interference with a \"downstream\" OTEC facility could result due to increased biomass induced by the presence of nutrients upwelled and discharged by an\"upstream\" OTEC). (b) What types or categories of non- OTEC ocean uses or user groups should be specifically recognized in NOAA's regulations on non-interference? (c) What standards or criteria should NOAA use to determine -whether significant interference with other ocean uses would in fact occur? For example, how should NOAA define the phrase\"significant difference in-temperature\" under section 3(17)? - (d) What methodsand/or standards should NOAA use to reduce or prevent OTEC-related interference-with other ocean uses and users? (For example, NOAA could use license conditions; efforts to mediate-or arbitrate disputes; and criteria elaborating on the\"reasonable regard\" principle ofinternational law.) (Relevant sections of the Act: section 109(a); section 109(b); section 3(17).) Initial NOAA View NOAA has not formulated initial views on these issues. Issue No. 18: Upper Limit on Number of OTEC Facilities and Plantships Should NOAA specify an upper limit' on the number or total capacity of OTEC facilities and plantships, either overall or in a specific geographic area, after conducting studies under section 107(b) of the Act? (See section 101(c)(14).) Initial NOAA View Although the cumulative environmental effects or the potential for depleting the thermal resource by operation of a number of OTEC facilities and plantships is certainly worthy of substantial attention, NOAA believes that we do not now possess (nor are we likely to possess within the next few years) sufficient information to support a regulation limiting numbers of OTEC facilities and plantships. In lieu of such a regulation, the environmental and use. conflict implications of multiple OTEC operations in the same geographic areas could be addressed during the application review process for later-filed applications (see section o11(c)(11) and 101(c)(13)). NOAA probably will defer any'decision on this issue until the studies required under section 107 have been conducted. Enforcement Criteria Issue No. 19: Compliance, Orders What criteria should NOAA apply to issuance of compliance ordere? (See, section 302(a)(2).) InitialNOAA View NOAA has not formulated an initial view on this issue. Issue No. 20: Suspension, Revocation, or Termination of a License Should NOAA establish special criteria or procedures for the suspension, revocation, or termination of an OTEC license under certain circumstances? (See section 102(a) and section 111(a).) InitialNOAA View NOAA has not formulated an initial view on this issue. V. Public Participation A.

Background In the Federal Register of December 21, 1979 (44 FR 75659)1 FDA issued a notice of proposed rulemakingin which it proposed to adopt certain new positions relating tothe status of nitrites in bacon and otherredmeats under the color additive provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act). As used in that proposal and in this document, the term \"nitrites\" includes sodium and potassium nitrate and, sodium and potassiumnitrite. The question of nitrites' status as\"color additives\" was presented initially to FDA on March 12, 1979, in a citizen petition filed jointly by Public Citizen, Inc., and four others (Ref. 1-44 FR 75662; December 21, 1979). Thecitizen petition asked FDA to declare that nitrites in bacon are \"color additives\" within the-meaning of 'section 201(t)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(t)(1)) that may not be used until approved by FDA under the color additive provisions of the act (21 U.S.C. 376). FDA responded to the citizen petition by letter on June 29, 1979 (Ref. 2-44 FR 75662; December 21, 1979). In that letter, FDA stated its tentative conclusions that: (1] nitrites in bacon are capable of \"imparting color\" within the meaning of section 201(t)(1) of the act, but (2) nitrites are not properly regulated as\"color additives\" because they qualify for the exception in section 201(t)(1) of the act for substances determined by FDA to be \"* * * used (or intended to be used) solely for a purpose or purposes other than coloring.\" Theresponse tO the citizen petition stated FDA's intention to initiaterulemaking to. reach final conclusions on these questions. As noted, FDA initiated the necessary rulemaking by publishing a proposal in the Federal Register on December 21, 1979 (44 FR 75659). The proposal explained that.FDA's tentative conclusion that nitrites are capable of imparting color to bacon would, if made final, also apply to nitrites used in other red meatproducts. Thus, FDA included in the proposal a request for information on whether red meat products other than bacon also might qualify for the exception to the \"color additive\" definition. FDA allowed a 60-day comment period on the proposal and request for information. At the request of several industry groups and firms, -FDA extended the comment period on the request for information to May 19, 1980 (see 45 FR 11841; February 22,1980) and then indefinitely (45 FR 32324; May 16, 1980). FDA based the indefinite extension- of the deadline on the request for information on the fact that information concerning possible exceptions to the '.color additive\" definition for nitrites in meats other than bacon would be-needed only if FDA concludes finally thatnitrites meet the threshold requirement for \"color additive\" status (i.e., are capable of imparting color). Because the expense required to collect the information would be wasted if FDA were to conclude that nitrites do not \"impart\" color, the agency agreed to defer the exception issue until after a final decision is reached on whether nitrites \"impart\" color.Although the comment period on the request for information was deferred, the comment period on whether nitrites \"impart\" color to. bacon and other red meats and whether nitrites in bacon qualify for the exception to the \"color additive\" definition closed on February 19, 1980. FDA received more than 150 comments on the proposal. The vast majority of the- comments focused on whether nitrites are capable of \"imparting\" color 9nd argued on scientific, legal, and policy grounds that FDA's tentative conclusion on this point was incorrect. FDA agrees that its - tentative conclusion was incorrect and now concludes that nitrites do not \"impart\" color to bacon within the meaning of section 201(t)(1) of the act. The reasons for this conclusion are discussed below. I. Discussion . The act defines the term \"color additive\" in section.201(t)(1), The term \"color additive\" moans a material which- , '. (A) is a dye, pigment, or other substance made by a process of synthesis or similar artifice, or extracted, Isolated, or otherwise derived, with or without Intermediate or final change of Identity, from a vegetable, animal, mineral, or other source, and (B] when added or applied to a food, drug, or cosmetic, or to the human body or any part thereof, Is capable (alone or through reaction with other substances) of Imparting color thereto; except that such term does not include any material which the Secretary, by regulation, determines Is used (or Intended to be used) solely for a purpose or purposes other than coloring. .Under this definition, a substance added to food is a \"color additive\" If It is \"capable * * * of Imparting color\" to the food, but color-imparting substances -can be excepted from the definition If FDA (by delegation of authority from the Secretary) makes certain determinations about the purpose for which the substance is used. The threshold question of whether a substance Is capable of \"imparting color\" obviously is of paramount importance; only if a, substance \"imparts\" color must FDA consider whether it qualifiea for the exception to the \"color additive\" definition. The \"color additive\" definition was enacted by Congress as part of the Color Additive Amendments of 1900, which established a separate premarket approval system for color additives. A similar system had been in effect for food additives since the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1950, Before enactment of the Color Additive Amendments, non-coal-tar colors added to food were regulated as \"food additives,\" but the Color Additive Amendments amended the definition of the term \"food additive\" to exclude\"color additives.\" Thus, in the months and years following enactment of the Color Additive Amendments, It was necessary for FDA to determine whether particular substances previously regulated under the \"food additive\" provisions of the act should be regulated instead as \"color additives.\" As many comments correctly point out, FDA's original determination with respect to nitrites was that they should continue under the \"food additive\" provisions of the act because the effect of nitrites in meat was merely to \"fix\" the color of the meat, not \"impart\" color. This original determination is reflected in FDA regulations promulgated as far back as 1962 in which sodium nitrite and sodium nitrate are specifically identified as \"food additives\" and are approved for use as preserVatives and fixatives (21 CFR 121.1063 and 121,10B4 (27 FR 2090; March 3, 1962), sirtce[ II --. -- = I I77044 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 1 Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules recodified as 21 CFR 172.170 and 172.175 (recodification in the Federal Register of March 15,1977; 42 FR 14302)). FDA has consistently throughout the years maintained its position that nitrites merely \"fix\" rather than \"impart\" color. The position is reflected in current FDA regulations (21 CFR 172.170 and 172.175) and has been asserted publicly by FDA in judicial proceedings. See Public Citizen v. Foreman, 471 F. Supp. 586, 593 (D.D.C. 1979). In addition, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulations governing the use of nitrites describe the color effect of nitrites as a color \"fixing\" effect (see 9 CFR 318.7(c)(4)). In response to 'the Public Citizen petition asking FDA to regulate nitrites in bacon as \"color additives,\" FDA reconsidered its longstanding position that nitrites merely \"fix\" color. The citizen petition argued that nitrites \"impart\" color to bacon because when nitrites are added to bacon they combine with the myoglobin naturally present in red meat to form a substance that, when heated during the curing process, yields nitrosohemochrome (or nitrosylhemochrome), which is similar in color to fresh pork (pink) but makes the color last longer. The petition contended that no pork without nitrosohemochrome has the exact color of meat with it, but the petition also argued that it is irrelevant for purposes of the \"color additive\" definition whether a substance changes the color of food in a noticeable way. By focusing almost exclusively on the details of the chemical reaction that occurs when nitrites are added to bacon, the Public Citizen petition appears to provide a plausible basis for concluding that nitrites \"impart\" color, and FDA tentatively adopted Public Citizen's position in its response to the citizen petition. In explaining its tentative conclusion that nitrites \"impart\" color, FDA described in its proposal the chemical reaction that occurs when nitrites are used in the curing of bacon (see 44 FR 75660 December 21,1979). The agency noted that the color resulting from the use of nitrites in bacon is \" * similar to, and sometimes nearly indistinguishable from. * *.. the color of the freshly slaughtered meat The agency tentatively concluded that nitrites\"impart\" color, however, because, after heating, meat without nitrites turns brown while meat with nitrites retains its pink color. The majority of comments attack FDA's tentative conclusion on several grounds. On technical grounds, the comments argue that the true color-imparting pigment in meat is myoglobin, which can be various shades of purple, red, pink, or brown depending on the compounds with which it interacts. They argue that the effect of nitrites Is to maintain the myoglobin in a stable form that is red in color, noting correctly that the intensity of the red color in nitrite- treated meat is related directly to the concentration of the pigment, not the amount of nitrites added to the meat- once the pigment is stabilized by nitrites, the addition of more nitrites does not increase the intensity of the red color. Thus, these comments seem to argue, color is \"imparted\" to meat by a naturally occurring pigment; nitrites merely \"fix\" the pigment in a form that produces a stable, red color. One comment included photographic evidence intended to show that there is no difference visible to the naked eye between the color of bacon cured with nitrites and the color of uncured pork belly (the portion of the hog from which bacon is produced) 1 day after slaughter. This comment cited a letter in the legislative history of the Color Additive Amendments from then Secretary of Health, Education. and Welfare (HEW] Flemming, which states that the HEW- drafted bill that became the Color Additive Amendments of 1960 was intended to cover substances whose coloring effect is \"apparent to the naked eye\" (H.R. Rep. No. 1761 at 79:1900 U.S. Code, Cong. and Adm. News 2929). According to the comment, the comparison of the color of nitrite-cured bacon with that of uncured pork belly 1 day after slaughter is the critical comparison for the purpose of considering whether nitrites \"impart\" color because it is about I day after slaughter that the uncured pork belly would be displayed to consumers on the supermarket shelf. The comment argues that, because there is no visible difference at this point between the color of nitrite-cured bacon and uncured pork belly, nitrites do not \"impart\" color. In addition to making these technical arguments, the comments point out that if FDA finally adopts its tentative conclusion that nitrites \"impart\" color, it will be changing a 20-year-old interpretation of the act without there being any new facts to justify a change. The comments are correct that the relevant scientific facts, i.e., the nature of the chemical reactions that occur when nitrites are added to meat, have not changed since the Color Additive Amendments were enacted in 1900, and there is no genuine dispute over what those reactions are. Thus. the issue of whether nitrites \"impart\" or merely \"fix\"color turns on how the chemical reactions are characterized for the purpose of applying the \"color additive\" definition. This is largely a matter of statutory interpretation; and, the comments argue, the interpretation given the statute by FDA officials immediately following its enactment is entitled to substantial deference. The comments argue further that, because the industry has relied on FDA's original interpretation for nearly 20 years, that interpretation should not be changed. especially in the absence of any significant new facts justifying a change. Based on the comments it received. FDA concludes that its reconsideration of whether nitrites \"impart\" or merely \"fix\" color, which the agency undertook in response to the Public Citizen petition, focused too narrowly on thd chemical reactions that occur when nitrites are added to bacon and other red meats and failed to give adequate weight to the practical meaning of the\"color additive\" definition and FDA's past interpretation of it. FDA concludes that its original and long-held position that nitrites in bacon merely \"fix\" rather than \"impart\" color reflects a sound and reasonable interpretation of the \"color additive\" definition. Nothing contained in Public Citizen's petition or in the comments on FDA's proposal justify a change in that interpretation. FDA's original position that nitrites are not \"color additives\" is consistent with the practical approach Congress intended FDA to take in distinguishing \"color additives\" from other categories of substances added to food by food manufacturers and processors. As noted above, just 2 years before the enactment of the Color Additive Amendments, Congress had enacted the Food Additives Amendment of 1958, which established a premarket approval system for all substances (including colors) that are added to food by food processors and manufacturers, excepting only those substances that are generally recognized as safe, had already been approved by FDA or USDA, or were subject to an existing. adequate regulatory scheme, e.g., pesticide residues under the Pesticide Residue Amendment of 1954. Congress and HEW (the Department that drafted the bill) thus were aware when the Color Additive Amendments were under consideration that all substances intentionally added to food would be subject to acceptably rigorous regulatory standards whether regarded as \"color additives\" or not and that it was therefore unnecessary to make fine distinctions among substances based on such refined considerations as the77045 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No.. 227 / Friday, November 21,, 1980 / Proposed Rules precise nature ofthe chemicaireaction that occurs when a substance is added to food. Illustrative of the practical approach Congress adopted for distinguishing\"color additives\" from other substances added ta food is Secretary Flemming's explanation., noted briefly above, for why coloring materials used in food packaging would not ordinarily be\"coloradditives,\" even if they migrate to the food: liJt is our view that the bill is intended to regulate substances that color or are capable of coloring food to a degree apparent to the naked eye. Thus. a component of food packaging that migrated into food but did not change its color in the ordinary sense of the term would continue to be regulated, if necesssary, under the food additives amendment and would not become subject to the proposed color additives bill. H.R. Report No. 1761, P. 79; 1960 U.S. Code, Cong. and Adm. News 2929. (emphasis added].' It also is clear from the legislative history that even substances that affect the color of food in readily apparent ways are not all 'considered \"color additives.\" In responding to a concern expre.sed by the pesticide industry that certain pesticides might arguably fall within the proposed \"color additive\" definition, Secretary Flemming wrote tle following to Congressman Oren Harris: The second question relates to pesticide chemicals as defined in section.201(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. We are advised-that certain fungicides used in fruit production have the effect not only of protecting the tree against plant diseases but also of affecting or supporting natural plant processes so the plant produces better color and finish in the fruit and some plant growth regulators, when applied to plants, likewise enhance the development of normal color in produce derided from them. It is our view that pesticide chemicals used in this way are not color additives within the meaning of the proposed legislation and-do not impart an artificial color to the raw agricultural commodities. Rather, they- promote the development of thL natural color of produce as a result of the normal physiological processes of the plant. The legislation which we drafted was not Intended to apply to pesticide chemicals which enhance color by affecting or supporting natural plant processes * * * Hearings on' HR. 7624 and S. 2197 Before the House Comm. On Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 86th Cong., 2nd Sess. 188-189 (1960) (letter from Arthur S. Flemming to Rep. Oren Harris). (emphasis added). It is likely that one could trace the chain.of chemical reactions that causally connect the pesticides discussed by Secretary Flemming andthe resulting color of the fruit, but that obviously is. not what Congress intended FDA to do-in-applying the \"color additive\" definition; The legislative history, coupled with the-use of the terms \"dye\" and \"pigment\" in the definition itself, suggest instead that Congress intended the. term \"color additive\" to cover dyes, pigments, and similar'substances-that are ordinarily thought of as coloring agents. Against this background, it is clear why the FDA officials. responsible for the initial implementation of the Color Additive Amendments did not regard nitrites to be -\"color additivies.\" Nitrites have been used as curing agents in modem meat processing since early in the century for their preservative, flavor, and color-fixative effects. During those years, the USDA regulations approving the use of nitrites have consistently described the coloring effect of nitrites as a color \"fixative\" effect and have explicitly distinguished between coloring agents per se (such as coal tar dyes) and~curing agents, whose purposes include, inter alia, \"fixation\" of color. This distinction is maintained in USDA's current regulation (see 9 CFR 318.7(c)(4)). When the Color Additive Amendments were enacted in 1960, FDA- officials presumably did not scrutinize the chemical reactions that occur when nitrites are added to meat in order to determine whether nitrites were to be regarded as \"color additives.\" They * apparently relied instead on the traditioinal conception of nitrites not as\"coloring agents\" but as \"curing agents\" * that accomplish a variety of processing purposes and that affect the color of meat in a way quite different from dyes, pigments, and other \"coloring agents.\" As the comments on FDA's proposal demonstrate, nitrites do not-add a new color to bacon, but instead react with the naturally occurring pigment in meat (myoglobin) to produce during the curing process a form of the pigment that is more 'table. The color of the nitrite- cured bacon is not readily distinguishable, however, from the color of the uncured pork belly at or shortly after slaughter. On these grounds, it was reasonable for FDA officials not to regard nitrites to be \"color additives\" and to continue to regulate them under the more logically applicable Food Additives Amendment The grounds that apparently underlie FDA's original position that nitrites are not \"color additives\" remain sound. In the ordinary slnse of the term, nitrites do not \"impart\" color, they merely \"fix\" the colornaturally present in meat, It is a well-founded principle of statutoryconstruction that the agency's interpretation of its own statutes should be given great weight, Public Citizen v. Foreman (D.C. Cir. No. 79-1690, July 31, 1980). In this case, FDA hereby reaffirms the agency's longstanding interpretation. In. reaphing its tentative conclusion that nitrites \"impart\" color, FDA relied in part on the fact that meat without nitrites turns brown after heating, while meat with nitrites retains Its pink color, However, as a matter of common sense, preserving oz \"fixing\" an existing color so that it does not change during heating is clearly not the same as \"'impartlng\" a new color. As shown by the legislative, history discussed earlier, it is the addition of a visibly different, new color that makes a substance fall within the\"color additive\" definition. Substances that affect the color of food in other ways are regulated under other provisions of the act. If, in applying the \"color additive\" definition, FDA were to take into account routinely the effects of healing (or cooking) on the color of processed foods, the task of.determining whether substances are \"food additives\" or\"color additives\" would become extraordinarily complex and would produce surprising results. The heat to which foods are exposed during processing or cooking is sufficient to change the chemical composition, and thus possibly the color, of many. substances both naturally present in and added to food. For example, sugar added to bakery products before cooking causes the finished products to have darker crusts than they otherwise would have. However, regardless of how one might describe the chemical reactions that occur, sugar and 'other substances that only affect the color of finished food articles as a result of changes in color that occur after exposure to heat during processing or home cooking are not the kind of substances Congress intended to regulate as \"color additives.\" By taking a practical, common sense approach to distinguishing between \"color additives\" and other substances, FDA has been able to avoid wasteful disputes about the proper regulatory category for such substances and to implement the Color Additive Amendments and other food safety provisions of the law In a way that is consistent with both the intent of Congress and the protection of the public health, As discussed earlier the majority of comments received argue in favor of FDA's final decision to consider nitrites as color fixatives and therefore not color additives. Comments also were received that argue that nitrites do in fact impartu Im77046 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules color as originally proposed by the agency. FDA has considered these comments and rejects them for the reasons stated in this document. Still other comments state that while nitrites do indeed impart color, they qualify for the exception to the color additive law since they are used solely for purposes other than coloring. Since the agency rejects the premise of these comments that nitrites impart color, further consideration of their status under the color additive law is irrelevant and therefore has not been considered by the agency in reaching this decision. Lastly, there were several comments that did not substantively address the issue of whether nitrites \"fix\" or \"impart\" color. Rather they generally argued that the risks and benefits of nitrites should be considered in deciding their status. All but one of these comments urged the continued availability of nitrites in meat products. The purpose of this rulemaking is to determine whether nitrites used in meat products are color additives within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. 321(t). A risk/ benefit analysis is not relevant to this consideration and, therefore, FDA has not considered these comments in reaching the decision that nitrites \"fix\" rather than \"impart\" color. Based on its conclusion that nitrites do not \"impart\" color to bacon, FDA will not adopt as final regulations proposed \u00a7 70.70 Capacity of nitrites in meat products to impart color and J 70.100 Nitrites in bacon, which incorporated, respectively, FDA's tentative conclusions that nitrites \"impart\" color but that nitrites in bacon qualify for the statutory exception to the \"color additive\" definition (see 44 FR 75662]. Those proposed regulations are hereby withdrawn. It also is unnecessary for FDA to consider further whether nitrites in meats other than bacon qualify for the exception to the \"color additive\" definition. FDA thus withdraws its request for information on that issue. FDA's conclusion that nitrites \"fix\" rather than \"impart\" color to bacon constitutes final agency action in response to the Public Citizen petition asking FDA to regulate nitrites in bacon as \"color additives.\" Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (secs. 201(s), (t)(1), 402(a), 701(a), 72 Stat. 1784 as amended, 74 (21 (t)(1), 342(a), 371(a), 376]] and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.1), the proposed regulations (44 FR 75639; December CODE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Office of the Secretary 29 CFR Part 2 General Provisions; Rule Making AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, Labor.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to a recommendation of the Administrative Conference of the United States, the Secretary of Labor waived his entitlement to the exemption from rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) for matters relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts. Before the regulation went into effect, most agencies under the Secretary of Labor had already informally adopted APA rulemaking procedures. Therefore, the regulation merely reaffirmed existing policy. However, it has become advisable to revoke in part the waiver of the exemption in order to assure that information-gathering procedures like those used by BLS are not subject to APA rulemaking requirements. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit hasrecently held that methqdology developed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to establish unemployment figures used for allotment of funds under Title VI of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act are \"rules\" which must be-promulgated pursuant to APA notice and comment procedures. Batterton v. Marshall, No. 78-1414 (Aug. 28, 1980). The Court of Appeals' decision makes clear, however, that such methodology would ordinarily be exempt from APA procedures as a matter relating to public benefits, under 5 U.S.C. 553(aJ(2). Had the Department not waived the exemption, these BLS procedures would not be subject to APA. informal rulemaking requirements. The Department's position has been that information-gathering procedures are not rules within the meaning of the APA, but rather investigatory functions not subject to APA requirements. Had the Department anticipated that such procedures could be deemed \"rules\" subject to APA notice and comment requirements, it would not have waived its right to invoke the exemption for information gathering relating to \"public property, loans, grants, benefits. or contracts.\" The Department's concern is for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Bureau's statutory role is to accumulate information on labor-related subjects for use of the Congress, other government agencies, and the public. The Bureau's information-gathering activities are statl3tical in nature and are conducted on the basis of scientific principles. To subject purely statistical decision making to procedures required for review of policy decisions under the Administrative Procedure Act might sabject BLS methodology to nonstatistical policy influences. It is essential to avoid equating statistical and policy decisions. The Secretary has therefore determined that it is necessary to amend the exdsting regulation and reclaim the right to invoke the 5 U.S.C. 553[a]F2] exemption insofar as it covers the Bureau's information-gathering procedures. The Department does not intend to invoke the exemption for any other matters \"relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts.\" but will continue its practice of using APA notice and comment procedures for any such matters othar than data collection procedures. The original waiver of the exemption was not promulgated pursuant to APA notice and comment procedures because it was a general statement of policy and a rule of agency procedure within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 553(b](A). (See 36 FR 12976 (July 10,1971)). For the same77047 77048 Federal Register /, Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules reason, it is not necessary to revoke the waiver pursuant to APA requirements for advance notice, public participation, and delay in the effective date. However, in furtherance of the public interest, the Department will voluntarily comply with the APA's comment period in revoking this agency procedural rule. In any event, the Department of Labor has determined that the proposal in this document is not a \"major regulation\" that requires preparation of a regulatory analysis and extension of the comment period to 60 days under Executive Order 12044 and the Department's guidelines published at 44 FR 5570 (Jan. 26,1979). Accordingly, the Department proposes to amend Part 2, Subtitle A of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations as set forth below. PART 2-GENERAL PROVISIONS 1. The authority citation for Part 2 reads as follows: Authority.-5 U.S.C. 301 and 5 U.S.C. 552-558, unless otherwise, noted. 2. Section 2.7 is revised to read as foll6ws: \u00a7 2.7 Rule making. It is the policy of the Secretary of Labor, that in applying the rule making provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. section 553), the exemption therein for matters relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits or contracts shall not be relied upon as a reason for not complying with the notice and public participation requirements thereof except for all information- gathering procedures adopted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210(202) 532-021. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background\" The Arizona Occupational Safety and Health Plan was approved under Section 18(c) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 667(c)) (hereinafter called the Act] and Part 1902 of this Chapter on October 29, 1974 (39 FR 39037). Part 1953 of this chapter provides procedures for-the review and approval of State change supplements by the Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health (hereinafter called the Assistant Secretary). Description of Supplements 1. The-State passed.several amendments to its Occupational Safety and Health Act on August 27, 1977. The amendments aie based on commitments made to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration before plan approval and include: a. A clarification that sanctions shall apply to violations of any provision of the Act, not only to violations of standards (A.R.S. 23-418). b. A provision that standards or regulations shall assure, as far as possible, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity even if such employee has regular exposure to the. hazard dealt with by such standard for the period of his working life (A.R.S. 23- 410). c. A clarification that notice of an intended inspection shall not be given prior to the time of actual entry upon the worksite (A.R.S. 23-408). d. Expanded provisions for the granting of extended abatement periods, including an opportunity for employees to participate in hearings concerning petitions for modification of abatement (A.R.S. 23-417).e. Clarifications of the definition of, \"interested party\" to include employees (A.R.S. 23-401]. f. Addition of information concerning the Review Board, including personnel and funding (A.R.S. 23-421, 422, 423, 433). 2. The State had also intended to submit an amendment deleting the requirdment that a non-serious violation exists \"unless the employer did not, and could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence, know of the presence of such condition or practice.\" (A.R.S. 23-401(9)). However, this legislation was not enacted, and the State is proposing that this amendment not be required. By letter of July 31, 1979, Larry Etchechury, Director of the Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health, indicated that the State has had no trouble proving employer knowledge and has not withheld any citations because of lack of employer knowledge. In addition, the State has promised to litigate if a citation for a non-serious violation is challenged on the basis of lack of employer knowledge. The State also promised to seek a legislative change to its Act if monitoring reveals any problems with this provision.

Eula Bingham, Assistant Secretary of or] BILLING COoE OF THE INTERIOR National Park Service 36 CFR Part 7 Buffalo National River, Ark.; Motor Boat Regulations; Restricted Access to Cave Systems AGENCY: National Park Service. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The first proposed rule will regulate motorboat usage on the Buffalo River. This is necessary because the narrow stream channel, character of river flow, and visitor use patterns will not allow for unregulated use of motorboats at Buffalo National River. The result will be a reduction in conflict among users and the maintenance of the pristine quality of the Buffalo River. The second proposed regulation will close most of the caves in Buffalo National River and institute a permit system for entry into those which remain open. This will protect the natural resources of the wild cave system and promote the safety of park visitors who may enter them. DATES: Writtem comments, suggestions. or objections will be accepted until December 22, 1980. ADDRESS: Comments should be directed to: Superintendent, Buffalo National River, Post Office Box 1173, Harrison, Arkansas 72601. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. John Welch, Acting Superintendent Buffalo National River, Telephone: (501) 741-5443. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:Background The proposed motorboat regulation is being promulgated by the National Park Service to protect visitors and resources within Buffalo National River. This action is also a part of the final master plan and the proposed regulation has undergorte public review within the master plan process. As proposed, it will provide for a reduction in visitor use conflict on the rocky, shallower upstream portions of the river where powerboat and hand powered crafts are in conflict. It will reduce the impact of petro chemical pollutants from motorboats on the aquatic fauna and flora of the river and on water quality. It will also enhance the prestine experience of river users by reducing the manmade noise common to motor driven boats. These same factors are present, but to a lesser degree, for the lower reaches of the Buffalo. On the lower one-third, from approximately U.S. Highway 14 to the mouth at the White River, the flow of the Buffalo increases and the river channel widens. Because of this increased flow and widening of the river canyon, the character of the river allows for limited powerboat usage if motors are restricted in size, i.e. horsepower ratings. The determination to regulate entry into the wild cave systems at Buffalo National River was based on the following considerations: 1. The recognized responsibility of the National Park Service for visitor safety; and 2. The legislative mandate that the National Park Service conserve and preserve the natural resources of Buffalo National River for future generations. In developing this regulation, it was recognized that the speleological environment is an exceedingly delicate one and very responsive to human intrusion. The conditions of caves over time and the value of the cave systems are directly affected by human traffic and the actions of these people as they visit these underground resources. Speleothemes removed or destroyed, marks made on the wall, canisters of carbide dumped on the floor-all acts incompatible with protection of the cave resources-are directly related to v;sitor use. These and other acts of vandalism will persist, If not indefinitely, at least for many years and will detract from the cave's value in every sense. Protection of the park visitor was another factor considered in establishing this proposed regulation. Visitors often enter these cave systems unprepared to handle the special situations and hazards inherent to wildcaves. They may encounter deep pits, mud slides, water traps, interconnected passageways and cold damp environments which increase the potential for hypothermia. In developing the proposed regulation to protect the caves and visitors, the following specific areas were considered: 1. Protection of the endangered species of Indiana and Gray Bats that use the caves at Buffalo National River for hibernaculums, maternity and swarming purposes; 2. Protection of fragile cave features and rare formations from damage caused by souvenir collectors, vandalism, carelessness and overuse; 3. Protection of visitors from dangerous hazards found in wild cave systems that they may be unprepared or untrained to handle; 4. Maintaining some unique and little used caves as research study areas where research in cave systems can he conducted; and 5. Protection of the archeological and historical resources found in cave systems at Buffalo National River from damage by vandals, artifact collectors, and careless users. Continuation of unregulated cave entry at Buffalo National River willlead to several adverse impacts: 1. A reduction or elimination of the endangered species of bats and other cave fauna; 2 A reduction in the fragile and rare cave formations; and 3. An increase in visitor accidents associated with cave systems. In preparing this regulation, the Superintendent has developed a list of caves open to public entry on government lands within the exterior boundaries of Buffalo National River. The caves which are listed as open to the public have been assessed and rated for content and hazards. All caves on the list are rated in classes that permit them to remain open to the public providing certain requirements are met. Persons who plan to explore the cave resources at Buffalo National River are urged to request from the Superintendent copies of free informational materials that describe the caves open to public use and other ' requirements. An environmental assessment on this proposed regulation on cave access has been prepared as required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (83 Stat. 852, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) This assessment is on file at the park headquarters at the address listed above.77049 Federal. Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules Public Participation The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practicable, to afford the publip an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written comments, suggestions. or objections regarding the proposed - regulation to the address noted at the beginning of the rulemaking. In the interest of brevity and efficiency, the National Park Service is publishing both of these proposed rules together. However, the Service reserves the right to publish either rule separately as a final regulation. Impact Analysis The National Park Service'has determined that this document is not a significant rule requiring preparation of a regulatory analysis* under Executive Order 12044 and Part 14 of Title 43 of the Code of Federal Regulations; nor is it a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the environment, which would require prepardtion of an\" environmental impact statement. Drafting Information The following persons participated in the writing of this regulation; John Turney, former Superintendent, and. John Welch, Buffalo National River, Harrison, Arkansas. Authority: Sec. 3 of the Act of August 25, 1916 (39 StaL 535, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 3); 245 DM 1 (44 FR 23384); and National Park Service Order No.,77 (38 FR 7478), as amended. F. R. Holland Jr.,# Acting Associate Director, Management and Operations. In consideration of the foregoing, it is proposed to amend Pait 7 of Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations by the addition of a new \u00a7 7.35 (a) and (b] as follows: \u00a7 7.35 Buffalo National River. (a] Gasoline, diesel, or other internal combustion engines with a rating of 10 h.p. or less may be used to propel water craft on Buffalo National River from Highway 14 access point to the White River: Iii all bther river locations internal combustion engines are prohibited.

(b) (1) All caves located on Federally owned lands within the exterior boundaries of Buffalo National River, Arkansas, except those which are listed as being open, are closed to publicentry. This list of open caves is available for public inspection at Park Headquarters at Harrison, Arkansas. (2) The Superintendent may issue permits for entry into caves or'parts of caves for scientific'purpos es a-d recreational use. (3) Entering into any cave system, except as provided for in tis sectioi, is prohibited.

SUMMARY: The Veterans Administration is proposing to amend its regulation to permit the implementation of general and specific ekemptions of the Privacy Act of 1974. Currently, for example, investigations conducted by the Office of the Inspector General are seriously hampered when the subject of an investigation requests, under the Privacy. Act, access to any and all information that the Inspector General has regarding him or her. Amendment of the regulation would allow the Veterans Administration to implement the exemptions for specified Privacy Act systems of records, thereby preventing subjects of an investigation from interfering with or frustrating the investigatory process, preventing disclosure of investigative techniques, and maintaining the Veterans Administrations ability to obtain necessary-information from third-party sources by protecting the confidentiality of-a source's identity.- DATES: Comments must be received on or before January 21, 1981 It is proposed to make this amendment effective the date of final approval. ADDRESSES: Send written comments to Administrator of Veterans Affairs (271A), Veterans Administration, 810 Vermont Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20420. All Written comments received will be available for public inspection' only at the Veterans Administration Central Office, Veterans Services Unit in room 132 of the above adaress between the'houts of 8 am and-4:30 pi Monday through Friday fexcept holidays) until February, 5,1981. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION bONTACT 389-\"' 3928]. Sections 552a(j] and (k), Title 5, United StatesCode, provide that the head of an agency may exempt any system of records from specific provisions of the Pr vacy Act of 1974. The Veterans, Administration has several law enforcement systems of records which warrant the protection afforded by \u00a7 \u00a7,552a (j) and (k). However, the current VA Regulation 582 does not permit the Veterans Administration to utilize either exemption. Specifically, under \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the agency would be exempt from disclosing identification information, criminal investigative materials, and reports compiled between the stages of arrest qand release from the agency's supervision. Under \u00a7 552a(k), the agency could refuse individual access to the accounting of Its routine use disclosures, and imder an express promise of confidentiality withhold the identity of a source. The agency would also be exempt from the requirements for publication of procedures for individual access and amendment, records source categories and the maintenance requirement for accuracy and relevancy of files. In order that the Veterans Administration may implement \u00a7 \u00a7 552a (j) and (k) of Title 5, U.S.C. for specific systems of records, VA Regulation 582 is being amended. APPROVED: November 17,1980, By direction of the Administrator Rufus H. Wilson, Deputy Administrator. In 38 CFR Part 1, \u00a7 1.582 is revised to read as follows: \u00a7 1.582 Exemptions. Certain systems of records maintained by the Veterans Administration are exempted from the provisions of the Privacy Act in accordance with exemptions (j) and (k). (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j) and (k)). The system of records which are in the (j) and (k) exemptions, are identified in the VA Privacy Act system of records notice.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 21.4264 is amended to eliminate references to the principal source of earning a livelihood for a veteran or eligible person in a farm cooperative course and to substitute a reference to the student's average weekly agricultural effort. This proposal does not meet the Veterans Administration's established criteria for significant regulations. They will have little effect on schools. The proposal will not require schools to make additional reports. The proposal will have no effect, either direct or indirect, on businesses, the general public, the environment, or State and local governments. There will be no costs to businesses or to educational institutions caused by this proposal. The proposal will have no effpct on other programs or agencies. The proposal will affect some veterans, but the effect will be beneficial since it will allow them to receive educational assistance allowance for which they may not have qualified otherwise.

November 17,1980. By direction of the Administrator. Rufus H. Wilson, DeputyAdministrator. Therefore, the Veterans Administration proposes to amend 38 CFR Part 21 by revising J 21.4284 to read as follows: J 21.4264 Farm cooperative courses. (a) Description of a farm cooperative course. A farm cooperative course is an institutional agricultural course. It provides training on a reduced basis to those engaged in farming, compared to other types of training. Part-time benefits are provided for students whose farming operation will not permit them to attend class at least 10 hours per week. (38 U.S.C. 1682; 1732) (b) Form cooperative students must be farmers. In order to receive educational assistance allowance a veteran or eligible person must be engaged concurrently in agricultural employment for an average of at least 40 hours per week. This agricultural employment must be relevant to the farm cooperative course. (38 U.S.C. 1682; 1732) (c) Acceptable class schedules. (1) The institutional portion of a farm cooperative course- (I) May be on a term, quarter or semester basis, or (ii) May consist of courses which- (A) Are offered during at least 44 weeks of the year, and (B) Require a minimum of 5 clock hours per week. (2) The time involved in field trips and individual and group instruction, sponsored and conducted by the educational institution offering farm cooperative courses may be counted toward meeting the clock-hour requirements. See \u00a7 21.4270(b) for measurement of farm cooperativecourses. (38 U.S.C. 1682 1732) (d) Application. (1) Any school desiring to enroll veterans, spouses or children in farm cooperative courses- (I) Will submit to the appropriate State approving agency a written application for approval in accordance with \u00a7 21.4253 or \u00a7 21.4254 as appropriate; and (ii) Must submit statements of fact showing at least the following: (A) That the course is set up in the school catalog or other literature of the school; (B) That the agricultural course is offered concurrently with agricultural employment; and (C) That the school itself verifies on a continuing basis that students are engaged for an average of at least 40 hours per week in suitable agricultural employment which is relevant to the institutional agricultural course offered by the school and is in an area consistent with their institutional training program. (2) For the purposes of this paragraph suitable agricultural employment must include employment on a farm or other agricultural establishment where the basic activity is either- (I) The cultivation of the ground such as the raising and harvesting of crops including fruits, vegetables and pastures, or (ii) The feeding, breeding and managing of livestock, including poultry and other specialized farming. (3) The Veterans Administration does not consider employment in training establishments which are engaged primarily in the processing, distribution or sale of agricultural products or combinations thereof, such as dairy processing plants, grain elevators, packing plants, hatcheries, stockyards or florists shops to be suitable agricultural employment. (38 US.C. 1682, 1732) (e) Approval criteria. The appropriate State approving agency may approve the school's application when the agency finds upon investigation that the school and its courses have met the following conditions. (1) The criteria specified in \u00a7 21.4253 or \u00a7 21.4254, as appropriate; and (2) The requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.

The intended effect of these revisions is to provide for the attainment and maintenance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for lead in Iowa. EPA is proposing to approve the revisions with exceptions. These minor deficiencies are discussed in the \"Proposed Actions\" section. EPA will work with the Iowa Department of Environmental Quality to correct these deficiencies.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On October 5, 1978, a NAAQS for lead was promulgated by the EPA. The standard was set at a level of 1.5 micrograms of lead per cubic meter of air ( g Pb/m3), averaged over a calendar quarter. As required by section- 110(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, within ninemonths after promulgation of a NAAQS each state shall submit a SIP revision which provides for attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS within the state. The state of Iowa has developed and submitted a SIP for the attainment of the lead NAAQS. The basic requirements of a lead SIP are outlined in 40 CFR Part 51, Subpart E (43 FR 46264, October 5, 1978). These provisions require the submission of air quality data, emission data, air quality modeling, a control strategy, and a demonstration that the lead NAAQS will be attained within the time frame specified by EPA according to the Clean Air Act. The deadline for attainment, as stated in the lead standard final rulemaking (43 FR 46246, October 5, 1978), is no later than October 31, 1982. Description of Proposed SIP Revision On August 19, 1980, the Iowa Department of Environmental Quality submitted, on behalf of the Governor, the state SIP for attainment of the NAAQS for lead. The SIP includes the following. (1) A summary of air quality data measured since 1974, a description of' the methods used to collect the data,' and an evaluation of the reliability of the data. No monitored exceedences of the lead NAAQS has been observed in Iowa since 1974. (2) A baseline emission inventory for all point sources emitting five or more tons of lead per year in Iowa, including a mobile source inventory. (3) A summary of projected lead emissions for point and area sources to 1983. (4) Air quality modeling around the two major point sources of lead within Iowa, two lead-acid battery plants. The modeling shows no exceedences of the lead NAAQS through late 1982 and early 1983. (5) A demonstration that the lead NAAQS will be attained and maintained around the two lead-acid battery plants. (6) A demonstration that mobile sources will not cause an excqedence of the lead NAAQS within the state. (7) A description of the control strategy for attaining and monitoring the lead NAAQS throughout Iowa. (8) A description of the Iowa regulations for new source review. (9) A description of the Iowa r~gulations for insuring maintenance of the lead NAAQS. (10) A commitment to do long-term monitoring around the lead-acid battery plants. (11) A description of the opportunities that the public had to comment on the lead SIP.EPA's Proposed Actions ' After evaluating the Iowa lead SIP as to whether it meets all requirements for an approvable lead SIP, EPA proposes to approve the plan. Minor deficiencies do exist in the SIP, and EPA requests the Iowa Department of Environmental Quality to correct these deficiencies. One deficiency of the SIP submittal is the date of attainment of the lead NAAQS. The SIP provides for an attainment date in 1983. This date Is erroneously based on the assumption that the attainment date should be three years from actual EPA approval/ disapproval of the SIP. The ahIainment date bhould be October 31, 1982, three years from the statutory approval/ disapproval date of October 31,1979. this time frame was set forth in the October 5,1978 Federal Register notice promulgating the NAAQS for lead (43 FR 46246). Since the SIP demonstrates that the State is presently In attainment and projects attainment through 1983, the difference in attainment dates (October 1982 vs. 1983) in this situation is not grounds for disapproval of the SIP. EPA requests Iowa to correct the attainfent date in the lead SIP to read October 31,1982 and submit the correction to EPA before EPA's final action on the Iowa lead SIP. A second deficiency of the SIP concerns review of new sources of lead. This deficiency, which applies to all criteria pollutants, was noted in a previous rulemaking published on March 6,1980 at 45 FR 14565. the State of Iowa has committed to revising their new source review regulations by December 31,1980. These regulations must provide for review prior to construction or modification of new sources with an estimated emission rate of 5 tons of lead or more per year. The procedure nust also provide for 30 days notice for the public to review the State's proposed actions before the final approval/disapproval of new source permits. EPA requests that the State submit information showing these deficiencies have been corrected before final acton is taken on the Iowa lead SIP. Other deficiencies of the SIP submittal concern the monitoring sites used for lead monitoring, and part of the , modeling done for the lead-acid battery plants. The SIP reports that most of the State sampling sit6s do not meet the currently proposed EPA siting criteria for lead monitoring, since the State's sites were selected before the criteria was formulated. Any future lead monitoring should be conducted at sites which conform to the EPA criteria for lead sites. EPA requests that the State77052 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday. November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules revise its lead monitoring system to conform to the EPA guidelines for long- term monitoring for lead. The State should submit the revisions to EPA in writing within nine months of the date that the final guidelines for lead monitoring are published. The State mentions that problems were encountered in the modeling of the lead-acid battery plants. Discrepancies were encountered between the EPA emission factors and stack test information obtained by the State at one of the lead-acid battery plants. Also, there is a question as to the proper method to extrapolate modeled 24 hour averages for lead to quarterly averages. The modeling done by Iowa does not show any exceedances of the lead NAAQS around the lead-acid battery plants. Since the State has committed to further modeling and additional monitoring around the two lead-acid battery plants, EPA considers these deficiencies as resolvable through continued work between the State and EPA. If, after additional modeling and monitoring, exceedances of the standard are predicted or observed, revisions to the Iowa SIP for control measures will be requested by EPA. Public Comments Under Section 110 of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and 40 CFR Part 51, the Administrator is required to approve or disapprove the regulations submitted as revisions to the SIP. The Regional Administrator hereby issues this notice setting forth these revisions as proposed rulemaking and advises the public that interested persons may participate by submitting written comments to the Region VII Office. Comments received on or before February 19, 1981, will be considered. Comments received will be available for public inspection at the EPA Region VII Office and at the locations listed in the Addresses Section of this notice. The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove the proposed revisions will be based on the comments received and on a determination whether the amendments meet the requirements of Section 110(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR Part 51, Requirements for Preparation. Adoption and Submittal of State Implementation Plans. The Iowa Department of Environmental Quality has certified, and EPA has confirmed that the public hearing requirements of 40 CFR 51.4 have been met. Under the Executive Order 12044, EPA is required to judge whether or not a regulation is \"significant\" and therefore subject to the procedural requirementsof that order, or whether it may follow, other specialized development procedures. EPA labels these other regulations \"specialized.\" EPA has determined that this regulation is a specialized regulation and not subject to the procedural requirements of Executive Order 12044.

ACTION: Proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY. In order to satisfy the requirements of Part D of the Clean Air Act, as amended, the State of Missouri revised its State Implementation Plan (SIP) in 1979. On April 9 and on May 9, 1980, EPA conditionally approved certain elements of Missouri's plan. On September 9,1980, the State submntted documentation that two of these conditions have been fulfilled. These conditions involve a schedule for implementing an inspection and maintenance (I/M) program for vehicle emissions control and a commitment involving the adoption of difficult transportation control measures TCLs). On August 7,1980, EPA published regulatory changes affecting new source review in nonattainment areas. A third condition, involving the definition of potential emissions, has been addressed by EPA's new source permit regulations. On September 24,1980, EPA published a Notice of Receipt to advise the public that the State of Missouri has made a submission involving these conditions. The conditional approval of the SIP was continued in that action. This notice advises the public that EPA proposes to approve the Missouri submission. Interested persons are invited to submit comments on this proposal. DATES: Comments must be received before December 22,1980. ADDRESS: Comments should be sent to Mr. Wayne G. Leidwanger, Air Support Branch, Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIL 324 East 11th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATIOW: On Aprl 9.1980, EPA conditionally approoved certain elements of Missouri's SIP with regard to the requirements of Part D of the Clean Air Act, as amended. A detailed discussion of that action can be found in the Federal Register notice published on that date (45 FR 24140). A. Inspection/Maintenance Program Section 172b]11) of the Act is applicable only in the case of ozone and carbon monoxide nonattainment areas which have been granted an extension beyond December 31. 1982, to attain the standards. The St. Louis area was granted an extension by EPA until December 31,1987, as discussed in the April 9 notice. Section 172(b[lul)(BI of the Act requires that the SIP establish a spedific schedule for implementation of a vehicle emissicn control inspection and maintenance (tNIM) program. I/M refers to a program whereby motor vehicles receive periodic inspections to assess the funtioning of their exhaust emission control systems. Vehicles which have excess emissions must then undergo mandatory maintenance. EPA has issued guidance on the general criteria for SIP approval including specific criteria for I/M programs. This includes a July 17.1978. memorandum specifying interim milestones in accordance with the general requirement of 40 CFR 51.15(c) requiring increments of progress for compliance schedules over one year in length. (For additional references regarding SIP approvability the reader should consult the April 9 rulemaking] Among other items, a specific schedule for implementing and I/M program, including interim milestones, must be included in the SIP. The Missouri SIP did not establish such a schedule. As a result, one of the conditions promulgated by EPA on April 9 required the State to develop by August 31,1980, a schedule which will be followed to lead to a mandatory I/M program. On September 9.1980, the State submitted an I/M program schedule.77053 77054 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules EPA believes the schedule submitted by Missouri for the I/M program in the St. Louis area complies with EPA policy. The schedule includes the major milestones which will lead to a mandatory I/M program. Proposed Action EPA proposes to approve the I/M schedule as part of the Missouri SIP and to revoke the applicable condition. B. Transportation Control Measures Section 172(b)(11)(C) of the Act requires the SIP to identify other measures necessary for attainment of the air quality standards. This includes transportation control measures (TCM's) as referenced in Section 110(a)(3)(D). The Missouri SIP includes emission reductions for TCM's in the St. Louis area. The East-West Gateway Coordinating Council (EWGCC) is the designated lead planning agency for the St. Louis region and has the required legal authority to develop transportation plans. Although EWGCC is committed to an analysis of alternative TCM's, the SIP did not provide a commitment to justify any decision not to adopt difficult control measures. Section 108(f) lists measures which EPA believes are reasonably available. Consequently, in the April 9 rulemaking, EPA promulgated a condition requiring that EWGCC provide by August 31, 1980, a commitment to justify any decision not to adopt difficult control measures./ On June 25,1980, the EWGCC Board of Directors adopted a resolution to comply with the above condition. The state submitted it as a SIP revision on September 9, 1980. EPA believes the resolution provides the necessary 'commitment regarding difficult TCM's. Proposed Action EPA proposes to approve the commitment by EWGCC as part of the Missouri SP and to revoke the applicable condition. C. New Source Review in Nonattainment Areas On May 9, 1980 (45 FR 30626), EPA promulgated-final rulemaking on Missouri's regulations for the review and permitting of new of modified sources of air pollutant emissions in nonattainment areas. One of the conditions for approving these regulations was that the state change the definition of potential emissions to be consistent with EPA's definition by March 1, 1981. The state definition allows sources to include enforceable permit conditions on operating rates and hours of operation and to include air pollution control equipment incalculating annual emissions. At the time of the May 9 rulemaking, EPA had both an existing and a newly proposed definition of the term and the state definition was not consistent with either. (A detailed explanation is given in the May 9 Federal Register notice.) On August 7,1980, EPA published regulatbry changes affecting new source review in nonattainment areas (45 FR 52676). A final definition of potential emissions'was promulgated (amended \u00a7 51.180j)(1])iv). That definition included the provisions similar tothose previously adopted by the State of Missouri. However, EPA's definition states that any physical or operational limitation taken into consideration in determining potential emissions must be Federally enforceable. Th6 Missouri regulation states only that \"enforceable permit conditons\" may be considered. The Missouri regulation might allow consideration of physical or operational limitations, such as operating permit conditions, which would not be Federally enforceable. EPA believes that the Missouri definition of potential emissions is consistent with EPA's definition and that the condition promulgated on May 9 has been met. However, EPA is soliciting comments regarding the above issue, specifically, whether the regulation is approvable as written, or whether some remedial action by EPA is appropriate. Proposed action EPA proposes to revoke the condition concerning Missouri's definition of potential emissions. D. Conclusion There are other conditions promulgated by EPA which must be addressed by the State before the Missouri SIP can be fully approved. Until all conditions are met, conditional approval of the SIP will continue. The public is invited to submit comments on whether the Missouri submission should be approved as a revision to the SIP and whether the applicable conditions have been met. A notice of receipt was published in the Federal Register on.September 24, 1980 (45 FR 46826), at which time the public was advised of the submission. With the publidation of the notice of receipt and the 30-day comment period allowed on this proposed rulemaking, 60 days will have been allowed for public inspection and comment on the Missouri SIP revision. The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove will be based on comments received and on a determination of whether the amendments meet the requirements ofPart D and Section 110(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR Part 51, Requirements for Preparation, Adoption and Submittal of Implementation Plans. Under Executive Order 12044, EPA Is required to judge whether a regulation Is\"significant\" and, therefore, subject to the procedural requirements of the Order, or whether it may follow other specialized development procedures, EPA labels these other regulations\"specialized.\" I have reviewed this regulation and determined that it is a specialized regulation not subject to the procedural requirements of Executive Order 12044. This notice of proposed rulemaking Is issued under the authority of Section 110 of the Clean Air Act as amended. Dated: October 20,1980. Kathleen Camiln, RegionalAdministrator.

Introduction On May 21, 1980 (45 FR 33981) the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated conditional approval of parts of the New York State Implementation Plan (SIP) with regard to their ability to meet requirements of Part D of the Clean Air Act. The contents of these parts of the SIP and the history of their development aresummarized in an EPA notice of proposed rulemaking which was published in the Federal Register on December 10, 1979 (44 FR 70754). In addition, with regard to other parts of the plan concerning public transportation improvement measures, the reader is referred to an EPA notice of proposed rulemaking published on June 30, 1980 (45 FR 43794). Generally, the SIP contains regulations and other control measures aimed at attainment of the ozone and carbon monoxide national ambient air quality standards and public transportation improvement measures necessary to meet basic transportation needs. These measures were to be supported by plans, programs, projects, studies and other actions needed to ensure the development, and implementation of various measures to reduce motor vehicle emissions. In its review of the SIP, EPA found that the plan did not provide adequate administrative and technical procedures and other documentation necessary to ensure its further development and implementation. These shortcomings were identified in EPA's December 10, 1979 Federal Register proposal; the additional information necessary to correct them was identified in the following conditions on SIP approval promulgated by EPA in its May 21, 1980 Federal Register notice at 40 CFR 52.1674(e)(1), (2), (3), (5), (6), and (7): (e)(1). On or before August 1, 1980 the State must submit to EPA key milestones (actions and dates) associated with projects relating to the transportation control measures which are a part of its SIP. Measures which have a particular need for the identification of additional milestones with regard to their proposed actions include: (i) Parking Restrictions, (ii) Freight Transportation. (iii) Limitation on Authorized Parking, (iv) Bike Lanes (Demonstration Project), (v) Express Bus and Carpool Lanes, (vi) Pedestrian Priority Zones, (vii) Traffic Flow Improvements for Arterials. (viii) Traffic Flow Improvements for Limited Access Highways. tix) Employer Based Programs, (x) Private Car Restrictions, (xi) Alternate Work Schedules. (xii) Bicycle Lanes and Storage Facilities, and (xiii) Park and Ride and Fringe Parking. (e)(2). On or before August 1,1980 the State must submit to EPA an improved program of study for the broader application of the following measures:(i) Freight Transportation, (ii) Express Bus and Carpool Lanes, (iii) Pedestrian Priority Zones, (iv) Employer Based Programs, (v) Private Car Restrictions, (vi) Alternate Work Schedules, (vii) Bicycle Lanes and Storage Facilities. In addition, each new and existing study's schedule, its funding source, its anticipated products, its relationship to measures, projects and other studies, and procedures for tracking its progress and reporting on its findings must be submitted to EPA. (e)(3]. On or before August 1.190, the State must submit to EPA additional documentation to support its determination that-the measure, \"Controls on Extended Vehicle Idling,\" is not reasonably available. If such additional documentation cannot be provided, this measure must be recategorized. (e)(sJ. On or bofore August 1, 1980 the State must submit to EPA SIP revision criteria and procedures for making changes to transportation projects contained in the SIP. Criteria for\"significant\" change to a project should consider the degree of change in a project's scope, cost, schedule for implementation and status as to its\"reasonableness.\" SIP revision procedures should provide for changes to a measure's categorization and the failure to include a project in the Transportation Improvement Program. (e)(6). On or before August 1,1980 the State must submit to EPA SIP revision criteria and procedures for making changes to transportation studies contained in the SIP. fe)(7). On or before August 1,1980 the State must submit to EPA identification of the resoarces necessary to carry out the transportation planning process and the following transportation elements of the SIP: (i) Parking Restrictions, (ii) Freight Transportation, (iii) Heavy Duty Gasoline Truck Retrofit, (iv) Express Bus and Carpool Lanes, (v) Pedestrian Priority Zones, (vi) Traffic Flow Improvements for Arterials, (vii) Employer Based Programs, (viii) Park-and-Ride and Fringe Parking, (Lx) Alternate Work Schedules. On July 28.1980, the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) responded to these conditions. II. State Submittal The State's July 28,190 submittal provides information related to77055 I Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 2f, 1980 / Proposed Rules transportation control measures contained in the SIP for the New York City metropolitan area. The submittal consists of: A transmittal letter to EPA;' a July 29, 1980 letter with attachments from the Tri-State Regional Planning Commission (Tri-State) to the NYSDEC containing information in response to conditions (e)(1), (2), (3), (6) and (7); an August 1, 1980 document prepared by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) entitled, \"Item #1 SIP Commitments: Status of Projects\" which addresses condition (e)(1), a document prepared by the NYSDOT in response to condition (e)(5) regarding SIP revision criteria and procedures for changing projects; and an August 5, 1980 memorandum from the NYSDEC containing a page inadvertantly excluded from the July 28, 1980 submittal. The following sections summarize the information presented in these documents and provide EPA proposed findings as to their adequacy with regard to each condition: A. Key milestones associated with projects relating to transportation control measures which are part of the SIP (condition (e)(1)). 1. Content The State submittal with regard to this condition consists of a document prepared by the NYSDOT entitled \"Item #1 SIP Commitments: Status of Projects\" and a letter from Tri-State. The NYSDOT document consists of a brief discussion of the transportation project development process and the milestones that have been selected to implement and measure progress of the various projects contained in the SIP. Estimated milestone completion dates for each project in the SIP for which the NYSDOT is responsible are also provided. The NYSDOT notes that it is' committed to implementing SIP projects, but it asserts that, due to unforseen circustances, it might not be possible to meet all completion dates. The criteria and procedures that will be followed if a date is not met are described in the discussion of condition (e)(5] relating to SIP revision. The NYSDOT uses a slightly different set of milestones for projects than the milestones suggested by EPA in its December 10, 1979 Federal Register notice. Those projects for which NYSDOT has responsibility do not include the EPA suggested financial milestone concerning the date that the project would be included in the State's Section 105 grant submission to the Federal Highway Administration. The State claims that, while the Section 105 program generally is a more accurate means of tracking projects than theregion's Transportation Improvement Program, it is not as good a means of tracking most of the SIP projects. Various reasons are given to support this claim. The NYSDOT projects also do not include the financial milestone calling for the date of inclusion of a project in State and local budgets. The NYSDOT document notes that,,with the exception of some park-and-ride projects and the Westchester County vanpool project, SIP projects do not necessarily require local matching funds. Therefore, the State contends that the appearance of these projects in a local budget is not necessary for implementation. Regarding the State budget, highway projects are not listed individually but are included as lump sum amounts for different types of projects. For highway projects it is State policy to match all federal money available with State funds. The information relating to this condition contained in the Tri-State letter rqlates to SIP projects for which agencies other than NYSDOT have responsibility. The material does not provide any discussion concerning the development, selection, and planned utilization of the milestones. Project milestones are provided but some EPA suggested milestones are not used for all transportation control measures. Table I presents milestones and completion dates as contained in the submittal for permanent and demonstration projects. 2. Adequacy EPA's review focused on whether or not suitable milestones were provided -for SIP projects. Generally, the milestones submitted by the State are adequate for use as a guide in implementing projects and for tracking their implementaion progress. However, milestones for some projects were missing from the State submittal. This -information sh6uld be provided to EPA during the public comment period. The State should also be aware that as work towards project implementation proceeds, milestones might need to be refined or created. B. An improved program of study for the broader application of certain transportation control measures and other improvements to the study program (condition (e)(2)). - 1. Content The State submittal with regard to this condition consists of: * A brief description outlining the process by which the improved program of study was developed;* A brief description of how'the existing program of study will be used to develop additional studies for the broader application of control measures: * A summary of new studies or previously proposed studies for which EPA Section 175 or Urban Mass Transportation Administration Section 8 funds have been allocated; and 9 The New York State air quality program schedule for development of the required July 1, 1982 SIP revision. The new studies included in the SIP for each measure are listed in Table 2. In addition to developing a program of study for the broader application of control measures, the condition required the submittal of additional Information on studies contained in the 1979 SIP revision. The State submittal provides some additional information about the existing studies. 2. Adequacy A program of study for the broader application of certain transportation control measures is critical for developing the 1982 SIP revision. Studies also are essential for determining a measure's \"reasonableness\" and opportunities for its application beyond those contained in the 1979 SIP revision, Based on review of the State submittal, EPA proposes to find the program of study for the broader application of measures to be adequate. The State's improved program of study is not a final program but, in Part, calls for the utilization of results of studies which are underway or proposed in order to determine where further study is needed. Although this approach is acceptable, the State submittal could, have been more comprehensive. For example, the State could have added to the SIP several existing and proposed transportation studies contained in the area's Unified Planning Work Program because of their ability to lead to the broader application of control measures, Also, most of the studies included in the submittal are not really \"new\" but were previously included in the SIP. Thus, EPA questions their inclusion in this table of \"new\" studies. In addition, several of the studies have completion dates in 1982. EPA questions how these studies will be used for preparation of a timely 1982 SIP revision. Except for information on how some existing studies will be used to identify new study needs, the State's submittal does not provide information on their anticipated products and their relationship to control measures, projects and other studies, Moreover, some studies have progressed since the 1979 SIP revision was prepared. This should have enabled the State toI I I I I I II77056 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1900 / Proposed Rules 77057 develop supplemental study milestones for determining the reasonableness of application of control measures. For example, as part of a capacity management study being performed by the New York City Department of Transportation a demonstration project is soon to be implemented on the East River Crossings. The milestones related to this demonstration project and follow-up activities should be developed. EPA understands that work is being performed to obtain additional information on this and other studies and encourages the State to submit this information to EPA during the public comment period so that it may be incorporated into the SIP.

Aat dond docamentation necessary to de temiae the reasaobkmss \"Controls on Extended Vehcle Iling\" (coadition (e)(3) 1. Content The State submittal with regard to this condition consists of a brief description of how this measure was classified in the SIP as being \"not reasonably available.\" Tkis discussion mentions that the measuze was classified as \"not reasonably availahle\" even though the SIP contained narrative material describing it as \"reasonabW' in certain counties ai the New York City metroplitaa area. Upon further evaluation the State has proposed to recategorize this measure on a geograpcal basis in the following manner as was doe in the SEP: New To* City-ms reasonably bs a lead role in the SR'uevisioa poscess, will coordinate the reevu Aim of these detrminations with each county and transportation coordinating committee. This activity wffl be performed hrough the use of a detaied set of criteria developed by the NYSDEt t ee ne reasonableness bf the measure. T-State, in conitnction with MYSM, has Pequested that comfies and principal cities in the area review their ciessifcation of this strate\" and povide adequate justification if the strategy is found to be not reesenebly avalable. Copies of these letters are included in the submittal. Based on the responses received, the NYSDEC will submit a revision to the MP to reclassify this measure, as appropriate. 2. A dequocy EPA's review of this condition focused upon the adequecy of the additional documentation necessary to determine the reasonableness of the measure, \"Contmis en Extended Vehicle Idling.\" The Staet submittal gives Wttle in the form of adfienal documentation in this regard. TWet has been provided is the- basis s en whick the necessary evahmem wil proceed. The criteria to detenine reasonebleness concentrates on reg etery controls, EPA suggests that consideration also should be given to vo4untary controls. Otherwise, the criteria and procedvres to be utilized appear to be adequate. f a final finding of unreasonabl6ess is made, the State shouW submit a formal SIP revisionoffering sufficient evidenvce for making this deterinatio. If the measure is found to be reasonably available. commitments to study or implement it should be incorporated in the SIP. In addition, specific studies of the measure should be incorporated into the area's Unified Planning Work Program. Any finding should be reviewed and endorsed by the appropriate elected officials, transportation coordinating committee and Tri-State. D. Criteria andrprocedures for revising and making changes to transportation projects contained in the SIP (Condition (e)(5)). The State submittal with regard to this condition focuses on developing criteria and procedures for revising and making changes to transportation projects contained in the SIP. This condition was promulgated primarily because the SIP did not fulty describe a process for determining when and how to change projects contained therein. Criteria to determine what constitutes a\"significant change\" to a SIP project. which in kim necessitates the development of justification for a SIP revisio , were not adequately described in the 1IM9 SIP revision. Also, the procedures for c a project's status from ' available\" to\"not reasenaWy avaibl\" were not fully developed. In addition, the State's proposed proce*re to delete a SIP project from the Transportation Improvement Program if no claim of emission reduction credit was made for that project was found to be unacceptable by EPA. In its sbmal, the State stresses that the SIP revisio process must not be so cumbersome as to delaf development of the IM MP revision. The procedures described uilie the ongoing transpotation-air quality planning process, including review by the appropriate cidxen advisory committee. Any chasge to a project's milestones or classifation of reasonableness will be subject to the procedures. The State submittal isludes a commitment to develop for indusion in the SIP substitute actions sufficient to offset any adverse air quality impact of a change to a project that results in the inability of the State to continue making reasonable further progrme towards attainment of standards. Where a change to a project does not j*paidize reasonable further progress and adequate justification for the change is provided, it also will be proposed to EPA as a SIP revision. Only \"significant\" changes to a project will be subject to a full justification and air quality analysis. Achange will be considered \"significant\" if any of the following criteria are meL: * The schedule for final implementation (not intermediate stepsl has to be postponed by more than is months from the date specified in the SIP; \" A change of greater than 10 percent is made in a specific characteristic of a project that is likely to change the project's impact on air quality. Such characteristics could be the cost for implementing a program commitment. the miles of a bikeway or the square footage of a pedestrian mall: or The State or responsible implementing agency does not intend to, or cannot, carry out a SIP project. An increase in cost will not necessitate a SIP revision so long as the action is still expected to meet the commitment and schedule defined. If a change in cost requires a project modification that exceeds any of the aforementioned criteria, then cost will he cited as the justification called for in the procedure. 2. Adequacy EPA's review of this condition examined the adequacy of the criteria and procedures for making changes to transportation projects contained in the SIP. A primary objective of EPA in establishing this conditianwas to keep the SIP development process dynamic and flexible, yet at the same time honoring previous commitments and ensuring that measures necessary to ensure attainment of air quality standards as expeditiously as possible are contained in the SIP. Generally, EPA found the State submittal with regard to this condition to be acceptable. However, the criteria could be Improved. The criterion fordefining when a delay in project implementation is\"significant' appears to be unduly lenient and could jeopardize the achievement of reasonable further progress towards attainment of air quality standards. EPA suggests that consideration be given to changing the threshold time period for this criterion from 15 months to 6 months. This time period is within the annual time period used by the State to determine if reasonable further progress is achieved. Using a 6-month delay as the threshold for assessing whether a change is\"significant\" will help ensure against the possibility that project delays will jeopardize achievement of reasonable further progress. EPA also suggests that the State establish time periods for implementing the procedures. For example a suggested period of four months appears77073 I Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules to be reasonable for the time period from when a SIP revision is found to be necessary because of a change in a project and when the revision is submitted to EPA. Other time periods which should be defined include those for determining whether a change to a project is \"significant.\" Such schedules should consider the-time requirements needed to work within the integrated transportation-air quality planning process. E. Criteria .andprocedures for revising and making changes to transportation. studies contained in the SIP (condition (e)(6)). 1. Content The State submittal with regard to this condition does not present any formal criteria and procedures for revising and making changes to transportation studies contained in the SIP. The State asserts that, since each study is unique and has a particular objective, scope, cost, schedule, and status, little benefit would be dervied from developing general criteria: Instead, the State proposes that a SIP Study Committee be established consisting of representatives of EPA, the Urban Mass Transportation Administration,.the Federal Highway Administration, NYSDEC, NYSDOT, Tri- State and study sponsors. Any proposed change to a study would be presented to the Committee by the sponsoring agency along with a demonstration that the proposed change would not significantly affect reasonable further progress toward attainment of air quality standards. The Committee would act within 60 days of receiving a proposed study change and provide the sponsor with a determination on whether or not the change was acceptable as submitted or acceptable with conditions. The sponsor would have 30 days to respond to the conditions. Once a study change has been approved by the Committee, it would be submitted to the appropriate transportation coordinating committee, citizen advisory committee, and to the Tri-State Standing Committee on Transportation for review and approval. All approved changes will be incorporated into the Unified Planning Work Program as that document Is updated. 2. Adequacy Generally, EPA finds the State's proposal to establish a SIP Study Committee instead of developing general criteria for changing studies in the SIP to be adequate. This procedure should ensure that the SIP program of study will remain viable. However, EPA is concerned that there is no definitionof what is a significant effect on reasonable further progress 'Before the Committee could act on a change, this term would have to be fully defined and agreed to-by the membes of the , \" Committee. EPA suggests that criteria and procedures similar to those which will be used by the State for evaluating. changes to SIP projects also be applied to studies. In addition, when determhing whether a change to a study is acceptable, the Committee must consider its impact on the ability of the State'to prepare the 1982 SIP revision and any other future revisions. F. Identification of the resources uecessary to carry out the transportation planning process and certain transportation elements of. the- SIP (e)17)). 1. Content The State submittal with regard to this condition identifies three primary transportatioi related elements'of the SIP and the resources n6cessary to carry them out: Implementation and demonstration actions The submittal provides three tables which list the cost and funding source for various SIP projects. Some information on resources was unavailable to the State and thus not provided. No cost information was provided for projects whic already have been implemented. o Special SIP and relate studies The submittal provides a table which summarizes the resources available, abcording to funding source, for studies listed as \"committed\" or \"underway\" in the 1979 SIP. This table includes all studies that were initiated before July 1980. Studies that are not underway, but which have committed funding, are presented in the table. The submittal also provides another.table which summarizes, bi funding source, costs for SIP and related studies scheduled to start July 1, 1980 or later. These studies are to be primarily composed of the Section 175 Phase 1[ and Urban Mass Transportation Administration Section 8 grants contained in the 1980-1981 Unified Planning Work Program. Transportation planning process The submittal provides a table which summarizes the necessary funding available for the transportation planning process. This funding is also identified in the 1980-1981 Unified Planning Work Program. 2. Adequacy', I GenerAy, EPA finds the identification of resources to be adequate. However, a major\"\"shortcoming is the lack of Identification of the manpower resources being committed to by agencies.responsible for SIP development and implementation. Since some agencies have a large degree of responsibility and limited staff available, an assessment of resource adequacy would be beneficial and should be submitted by the State during the public comment period, A major problem is that the submittal identifies only the total dollar amounts available for the study program. Funding available for individual studies Is not identified. However, the State's May 21, 1980 proposed revision to the SIP did provide most of this detailed financial information relating to studies (see 45 FR 56369, August 25,1980). The submittal does not provide any information related to the heavy duty gasoline truck retrofit mbasure. However, EPA is providing the State with $300,000 in Clean Air Act Section 105 funds to determine the reasonableness of this measure. These funds should be sufficient to accomplish this effort. If the idudy finds this measure to be reasonable, the State will then have to identify the necessary resources for its implementation. II. EPA Proposal EPA proposes to find that the State's August 2,1980 submittal adequately meets the conditions on approval of the New York SIP promulgated at 40 CFR 52.1674 (e) (1), (2), (3), (5), (6) and (7). The purpose of requiring the submittal was to improve the existing SIP by' identifying and commiting to a control program adequate to prepare an acceptable 1982 SIP revision and to implement the 1979 SIP revision, IV. Public Comment This-notice Is Issued as required by Section 110 of the Clean Air Act, as amended, to advise the public that comments may be-submitted as to whether the proposed revision to the New York State Implementation Plan for the New York City metropolitan area should be approved or disapproved. The Administrator's decision regarding approval or disapproval of this proposed. plan revisiorwill be based on whether it meets the requirements of Sections 110 and 172 of the Clean Air Act and applicable EPA requirements in 40 CFR Part 51. This current SIP revision request was submitted to EPA in accordance with the appropriate CFR requirements, Section 174(b) of the Clean Air Act requires that SIP revisions be coordinated with the continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive transportation planning process required under Section 134 of Title 23 of theI I I I I I I77074 Federal Register I Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules United States Code. EPA particularly invites comments from the Tri-State Regional Planning Commission (the Metropolitan Planning Organization for the New York City metropolitan area), its committees, and any other transportation planning agencies or organizations which have SIP-related responsibilities. Comments received on or before January 21, 1981, will be considered in EPA's final decision. All comments received will be available for inspection at the Region HI Office of EPA at 26 Federal Plaza, Room 1005, New York, New York 10278. Under Executive Order 12044, EPA is required to judge whether a regulation is\"significant\" and therefore subject to the procedural requirements of the Order or whether it may follow other specialized development procedures. I have reviewed this package and determined that it is a specialized regulation not subject to the procedural requirements of Executive Order 12044.

SUMMARY. On July 18,1980, the State of Wyoming submitted a revision to the Wyoming Air Quality Standards and Regulations which provides for the establishment of source specific opacity limits for large fuel burning units. The State's mass emission limit remains unchanged. EPA proposes to approve the State's revision and solicits comments on whether this revision meets the requirements of 40 CFR Part 51 and the Clean Air Act DATE: Written comments should be submitted on or before December 22, 1980. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to: Robert R. DeSpain, Chief, Air Programs Branch, Environmental Protection Agency, 1860 Lincoln Street, Denver, Colorado 80295, (303) 837-3471.Copies of the revision are available for public inspection between 8.00 a.m. and 4.'00 p.m. Monday through Friday at the following offices: Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, Air Programs Branch, 1800 Lincoln Street, Denver, Colorado, 8029.

Kircher, Chief, Planning and Operations Section, Environmental Protection Agency, 1860 Lincoln Street, Denver, Colorado 80295 (303) 837-3711, SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 18,1980, the State of Wyoming submitted a revision to the Wyoming Air Quality Standards and Regulations which provides for the establishment of source specific opacity limits for large fuel burning units upon petition from the operator that the unit Is unable to meet the otherwise applicable opacity limit (20 percent) but is meeting the applicable mass emission limit. This provision applies to fuel burning units withiheat input of greater than 2500 x 10Btu per hour, and the newly established opacity limit may not exceed 40 percent. Since the proposed exemption requires that the mass emission limit be met by the source, this provision will not result in increased emissions and will not jeopardize attainment and maintenance of the national ambient air quality standards in Wyoming. Interested persons are invited to comment on the revision and whether it was adopted and submitted in accordance with the requirements of Section 110 of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR Part 51 (Requirements for the Preparation, Adoption, and Submission of State Implementation Plans). Comments submitted on or before December 22, 1980 will be considered. EPA finds good cause for limiting the comment period to 30 days because the revision is administrative in nature and would not result in a change in emissions from any source. Under Executive Order 12044, EPA Is required to judge whether a regulation is\"significant\" and therefore subject to the procedural requirements of the Order or whether it may follow other specialized development procedures. EPA labels these other regulations \"specialized.\" I have reviewed this regulation and determined that it is a specialized regulation not subject to the procedural requirements of Executive Order 12044.This notice of proposed rulemaking is issued under the authority of Section 110 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7410.] Dateh CFR Part 60 [AD-FRL-1561-7] Review of Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources: Phosphate Fertilizer Plants AOENCr.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Fluoride was the only pollutant other than the criteria pollutants, specifically named as requiring Federal action in the March 1970 \"Report of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to the7'7075 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules United States (91st) Congress.\"' The report concluded that \"inorganic fluorides are highly irritant and toxic gases\" which, even in low ambient concentrations, have adverse effects on, plants and animals. The United States Senate Committee on Public Works in its report on the Clean Air Amendments of 1970 (Senate Report No. 91-1196, September 17,1970, page 9) included fluorides on a list of contqminants that have broad national impact and require Federal Action. The 'Engineering and Cost Effectiveness Study of Fluoride Emissions Control\" (contract EHSD 71- 14), published in January 1972, listed the phosphate fertilizer industry among the largest fluoride emitters in the Uniited States, accounting for nearly 14 percent of the total soluble fluorides emitted annually at that time. On October 22,1974 (39 FR 37602),' under section 111 of the Clean Air Act. and amended, the Administrator proposed standards of performance for' five new affected facilities-within the phosphate fertilizer industry as follows: Wet-process phosphoric acid plants, suoerphosphoric acid plants, diamnmonium phosphate plants, triple superphosphate plants, and granular triple superphosphate storage facilities. The regulation, promulgated on August 6, 1975 (40 FR 33152], limits total fluoride emissions to the following weights per unit of PO, input- Wet process phosphoric acid, triple superphosphate, 0.1 g/kg (0.20 lb/Ti. Emission limits for granular triple superphosphate storage facilities are 2.5X10-4g/hr per kilogram stored (5X10-4lb/hr ton). There is no opacity regulation. The Clean AirAct Amendments of 1977 require that the Administrator of EPA review and, If appropriate, revise established standards of performance, for new stationary sources at least ever3 4 years (Section 11(b)(1)(B)). This notice announces thatEPAhas completed a review of the standard of performance for phosphate fertilizer plants and invites comment on the results of this review. Findings Industry Growth Rate During the years 1974 through 1979, the production capacity of the domestic fertilizer industry increased as follows: For wet process phosphoric acid, 46 percent; superphosphoric acid, percent; and triple superphosphate, 15percent. Superphosphoric acid contains much less water per unit of P2Os than does wet process phosphoric acid; therefore, ihe resulting saving in weight and shipping costs has encouraged increasing the capacity for manufacturing superphosphoric acid. Also, superphosphoric acid is less corrosive than wet process phosphoric acid and can be stored with less deposition of impurities. Additions to triple superphosphate capacity have, decreased because of the recent trends toward liquid fertilizers, which are easier for the farmer to apply. The estimated growth from 1980 to 1985 in domestic phosphate fertilizer plants is limited, for the following reasons. Facilities for the manufacture of phosphate fertilizer from-phosphate rock were-overbuilt in the 1970's and are only now approaching full utilization of production capacity. The'use of phosphate fertilizer in the United States decreased about 9 percentin 1978, partly because of alleged overfertilization of some soils. Potential production increases outside the United States may reduce exports. Control Technology Current Control Technology There have been no notable improvements in the design of aqueous scrubbers since the present standards were promulgated. Some improvement has been reported in the operation of the scrubber with less plugging and with reduced downtime when plugging occurs. Emerging Control Technology The gypsum pond is considered to be one of the major fluoride emission sources in a phosphate fertilizer plant. However, the pond emits a relatively large weight of fluoride from an area that is very great compared with that of the, other sources. Nevertheless, pond contribution to ground level concentration of fluorides is evidently small, as indicated by the effectiveness of scrubber controls in reducing high ground level concentrations. An interesting recent development is claimed to permit eliminating about half of the pond area with a resulting pond fluoride emission reduction of about 50 percent. This reduction is made by shifting the plant cooling load fromthe pond to a closed-circuit cooling tower. The cooling tower in turn supplies a fluoride scrubbing system with Water. Fluoride evolution from this scrubbing system has been reduced at one of two ' plants by partial recoveryof fluoride as salable 25 percent fluosilisic acid and by liming to further prevent orreducefluoride emissions. It is not practical to depend on liming alone, however, because of the costs of the large tonnage of lime that would be required. These processes that combine pond area reduction with closed cooling tower, scrubber, and liming systems now appear to be in their development stage. More experience is needed to determine their costs and performances. The hemihydrate process, an old process revived by the Japanese, makes wet process phosphoric acid by crystallizing calcium sulfate twice in different forms. The final crystal Is the familiar dihydrate, but this product contains very little phosphate in the crystal. This decrease In the phosphate content of the gypsum crystals increases the yield of phosphoric acid and also produces a purer and more salablo gypsum. In addition, 30 percent or more of the fluoride originally present in the phosphate rock is said to be recoverable in salable form. The hemihydrate process has not been demonstrated In the United States. Domestic rock causes difficulties in this process, and the hemihydrate process would have to be investigated fully to determine whether these difficulties can be overcome. One plant makes triple superphosphate directly from wet process phosphoric acid and calcium carbonate. The only potential for fluoride emissions arises from the fluoride content of the wet process phosphoric acid. This might be advantageous in a local situation: but the balance of the potential fluoride evolution would only be'transferred elsewhere to wherever the wet process acid was made from phosphate rock. One fertilizer plant has added a dry absorption process that is due to come on line in 1980. In this process a dry absorbent is continuously injected into the plant tailgas stream. The dry solid adsorbs gaseous fluorides, and both the original and the added particulates are then removed in a following baghouso, Operating data will be needed to assess this new process. Results Achievable With Demonstrated Control Technology Emission source test results were available for one of the emerging control technologies. Source tests for the plant that manufactures triple superphosphate directly by reacting calcium carbonate and wet process phosphoric acid showed fluoride emissions just under the new source performance standard of 0.1 g/kg P2O input (0.20 lb/Ti. Conclusions Based on the above findings, EPA concludes that the existing standards ofI | 77076 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules performance for fluorides are still appropriate. There have been no notable improvements in aqueous scrubber control technology. Further significant fluoride reductions by scrubbing are unlikely if ordinary gypsum pond water is used. Emerging technologies or their variants may later permit further reductions in fluoride emissions. EPA is studying radioactive particulate emissions from the phosphate fertilizer industry. If control is found advisable, emission regulations will be developed by the Office of Radiation Programs for this source under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Interregional Research Project No. 4 (IR- 4), New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, PO Box 231, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, has submitted pesticide petition number 9E2241 to EPA on behalf of the IR-4 Technical Committee and the Agricultural Experiment Stations of Idaho, Maine, Michigan, and New York. This petition requested that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, amend 40 CFR Part 180 by the establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of the chemical calcium hypochlorite in or on the raw agricultural commodity potatoes. The data submitted in the petition and all other relevant material have been evaluated. The pesticide is considered useful for the purpose for which the tolerance is sought. The toxicology and other scientific data considered in support of the proposed exemption were a rat acute oral Me. study of 0.85,gram (g) (0.64-1.3 g)/kilogram Ckg). Calcium hypochlorite is currently exempted from a tolerance requirement under 40 CFR 180.1001(c) as a sanitizing and bleaching agent when used in accordance with good agricultural practices as an inert (or occasionally active) ingrediqnt in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops or to raw agricultural commodities after harvest. No actions are currently pending against continued registration of this chemical. There is no reasonable expectation of residues in eggs, meat, milk, or poultry as delineated in 40 CFR 160.6(a)(3). The Agency has determined that the proposed exemption from the requirement of a tolerance will protect the public health. Therefore, it is proposed that 40 CFR Part 18o be amended as set forth below. Any person who has registered or submitted an application for the registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request by December 22,-1980 that this77077 Federal Register I Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules rulemaking proposal be referred to an advisory committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The California Department of Food and Agriculture, 1220 N St., Sacramento, CA 95814, has submitted pesticide petition 8E2083 to EPA. This petition requesTed that the Administrator, pursuant to sectioA 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, propose the establishment of a tolerance for residues of the fungicide 5-ethoxy-3-, trichloromethyl-1,2,4-thiadiazole and its mono-acid metabolite 3-carboxy-5- ethoxy-1,2,4-thiadiazole in or on the raw agricultural commodity strawberries. The data submitted in the petition and all other available material have been evaluated. The pesticide is considered useful for the purpose for which the tolerance is sought. The toxicology data considered in support of the proposed tolerance of 0.2 ppm in or on strawberries were an acute oral LDso of 1,077 milligrams [mg)/kilogram (kg) for rats; a two year rat oral feeding study with a no-observable-effect-level (NOEL) of 80 ppm; a two-year dog oral feeding study with a NOEL of 100 ppm; a rabbit study negative at 15 mg/kg for teratology and fetotoxicity; a rat reproduction study with a NOEL equal to, or greater than, 80 ppm but less than 640 ppm. Data currently lacking and considered desirable include an oncogenic evaluation in a second species. However, a two-year oncogenicity (feeding) study in mice is currently beinE conducted. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) has been calculated to be 0.025 mg/kg/day, based on the dog two-year chronic feeding study NOEL and using a 100 fold safety factor. The maximum permissible intake (MPI) for'the subject fungicide is calculated to be 1.5 mg/day/60 kg. Present published tolerances include those for avocados at 0.15 ppm and an interim -tolerance for cottonseed at 0.3 ppm.I The percentage of the ADI currently utilized by published tolerances is 0.05 percent. The requested tolerance would increase the percentage of the ADI utilized from 0.05 to 0.09 percent. The totalktheoretical maximum residue contribution TWMC) would be increased from 0.0007 to 0.0013 mag/day/ 1.5 kg. The metabolism of the subject fungicide is adequately understood and an adequate analytical method (electron capture gas chromatography) is available for enforcement purposes. Since strawberries are not a feed item, there is no expectation for residues of the fungicide.in meat, milk, poultry, and eggs. There are presently no actions pending against the continued registration of this chemical. Thus, based on the aboveinformation considered by the Agency, the tolerance of 0.2 ppm in or on strawberries established bV amending 40 CFR Part -180 would protect the public health. It is proposed, therefore, that the tolerance be established as set forth below. Any person who has registered or submitted an application for the registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request on or before December 22, 1980 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an advisory committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

ACTION: Proposed rule, SUMMARY: The Committee proposes to amend its regulations on the preparation of reports workshops must maintain on blind persons and on the procedures relating to changes in specifications or other descriptions of commodities or services on the Procurement List, The proposed changes regarding blind persons limit the reporting requirements to those required by law. The methods used by the Government in describing commodities have changed substantially since the current provisions of \u00a7 51-5.11 were established In 1973. The proposed changes provide guidance regarding the actions to be taken when there i a change in the specification, description or designation of a commodity on the Procurement List or the scope of work or other conditions in the provision of a service on the Procurement List. DATES: Comments must bereceived on or before January 20, 1981. ADDRESS: Committee for Purchase from the Blind and Other Severely Handicapped, 2009 14th Street, North, Suite 610, Arlington, Virginia 22201, FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. C. W. Fletcher, (703) 557-1145. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 51-4.3 assigns certain responsibilities to workshops participating in the Committee's program. a. Currently the provisions of subparagraphs a(6) require that the report on visual acuity and field of vision for blind persons be signed only by a licensed physician. This requirement has been found to be unduly restrictive since States license Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules persons other than physicians to measure visual acuity and field of vision. This subparagraph is being changed to permit any person licensed to evaluate visual acuity and field of vision to sign the reports maintained by workshops on blind persons. b. Subparagraph a(7) regarding the maintenance of reports of evaluations on the capability for competitive employment now applies to both the blind and the other severely handicapped. Blindness is defined specifically in Section 5(1) of Pub. L 92- 28 (41 U.S.C. 48b(i)). An evaluation of a blind person's capability for competitive employment and an annual reevaluation is not required for that person to qualify as blind. However, such evaluations and reevaluations are required as one element in establishing the qualification of a person to be classified as \"other severely handicapped.\" Subparagraph a(7) has been reWritten to cause this requirement to apply to the other severely handicapped only and has been incorporated in the revised paragraph (b) which now covers the requirements for the maintenance of records on other severely handicapped individuals. c. In a number of instances State or other public agencies assist workshops in placing clients in competitive employment. Subparagraph a8) has been revised to indicate that a workshop placement program may be operated by or for the workshop. Section 51-5.11 covers the responsibilities of procuring agencies regarding notification of central nonprofit agencies and the Committee on specification changes affecting comodities on the Procurement List. a. The section has been revised to expand the scope to cover services and has been updated to reflect the various types of documentation currently used by the Government in its purchasing actions. Several procuring agencies have misinterpreted the intent of the current -notification requirement. The section has also been rewritten to ensure timely coordination and notification of contemplated changes which would affect commodities and services on the Procurement List. b. A new \u00a7 51-5.12 has been added to cover replacement items for commodities that are already on the Procurement List. It is proposed to amend 41 CFR 51 as follows: 1. Revise paragraph 51-4.3(a)(6)(7) to read: \u00a7 51-43 ResponsibUties (a) * * * (6) Maintain a file on each blind individual which includes a writtenreport reflecting visual acuity and field of vision of each eye, with and without glasses, prepared by a person licensed to make such an evaluation. (7) Maintain an ongoing placement program operated by or for the workshop to include liaison with appropriate community services such as the State employment service, employer groups and others; and list with one or more of these services those individuals capable of normal competitive employment. 2. Delete paragraph 51-4.3(a)(8). 3. Revise paragraph 51-4.3(b) to read: (b) Each workshop for other severely handicapped participating under the Act shall, in addition to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, maintain a file for each other severely handicapped individual which includes: (1) A written report prepared by a licensed physician, psychiatrist, or qualified psychologist reflecting the nature and extent of the disability or disabilities that cause such person to qualify as other severly handicapped. (2) Reports on the individual's capability for normal competitive employment, prepared at least annually by a person or persons qualified by training and experience to evaluate the work potential, interests, aptitudes and abilities of handicapped persons. The file on individuals who have been in the workshop for less than two years shall contain the report of the initial or readmission evaluation and, where appropriate, the next annual reevaluation. The file on individuals who have been in the workshop for two or more years shall, as a minimum. contain reports of the two most recent annual reevaluations. 4. Revise 1 51-5.11 to read as follows: \u00a75.11 Speciffcation changes and similar actions. (a) Specifications or other descriptions for commodities on the procurement list may undergo a series of changes to keep current with industry changes and agency needs. Since it is not feasible to show the latest revision current on the publication date. only the basic specification or description is referenced In the procurement list. Procurement agencies shall notify the workshop and the central nonprofit agency concerned of the latest applicable specification or description. (b) When a government department or agency is changing the specification or description of a commodity on the Procurement List, including a change that involves the assignment of a new national stock number or itemdesignation, the office assigned responsibility for the action shall obtain the comments of the Committee and the central nonprofit agency concerned on the proposed change and shall notify the workshop and the central nonprofit agency concerned at least 90 days prior to the date for its implementation. (c) Similarly for services, the procuring activity shall notify the workshop and central nonprofit agency concerned at least 90 days prior to date that any changes in the scope of work or other conditions will be required. 5. Add a new \u00a7 51-5.12 to read as follows: \u00a751-5.12 Replacement Commodities. When a commodity on the Procurement List is replaced by another commodity which has not been previously procured, the replacement commodity is automatically on the Procurement List and shall be procured from the workshop designated by the Committee. The commodity being replaced shall continue to be included on the Procurement List until there is no longer a requirement for that commodity. tPub.

The need for this notice is to satisfy the statutory requirements as provided for in Sections Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, and Section 1001(a) and 1001(b) of the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977, as amended. A notice that the Secretary was preparing to make determinations with respect to the 1981 Feed Grains and Soybean Programs was published in the Federal Register on September 9, 1980 (45 FR 59363) in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553 and provided for a 30-day comment period. The press release dated September 12 requesting Comments on the 1981 Feed Grain and Soybean Programs extended the comment period to October 27, 1980. One hundred forty-five responses, coming from 28 States and the District of Columbia, were received. Those responding included 92 farmers, 18 State and County ASC Committees, 2 Soil and Water Conservation District Chairmen, 10 national farm organizations, 6 State farm organizations, 7national agribusinesses, 2 Congressmen, 2 national organizations, and 6 representing consumer and consultant interests. In addition, a survey was received from a producer association representing 314 larger scale producer views. A summary of the responses with respect to the 1981 crop of feed grains and soybeans is as follows: 1. National Program Acreages (NPA's): Eight commented. All recommended that the 1981 NPA's be equal to or less than those announced for the 1980 feed grain crops. 2. Set-Aside: Ninety commented, with 37 preferring some level of set-aside requirement for f6ed grains. Four recommended a 10-percent set-aside while 3 recommended 20 percent. The rest favored some level of set-aside. Fifty-three comments were received suggesting a zero set-aside. Sixty-seven percent of the producer association's survey responses favored no set-aside. 3. Land Diversion: Sixty-four , commented With 37 recommending some type of land diversion program for feed grains. These comments suggestedlevels of land diversion ranging from 10 to 25 percent; however, there was little consensus on the specifid percentage of land to be diverted. Fifty-seven percent of those surveyed by the producer association do not want land diversion. 4. National Recommended Reduction Percentage: Seven commented. All requested no percentage reduction in the acreage planted to feed grains from the previous year. 5. Target Prices: Sixty-eight commented, with 36 referring specifically to corn and 28 to sorghum. Target price levels preferred for corn ranged from $2.35 to $4.00 per bushel. Recommended sorghum target prices ranged froin $2.55 to $6.00 per bushel. Seventeen suggested adjusting target prices for NCA and set-aside compliance. Thirteen wanted target prices tied to inflation and the cost of production. Of those responding to the producer association survey, 45 percent favored a corn target price of $2.70 with'no set- aside. Fifty percent favored a target of $2.85 with set-aside. 6. NationalAverage Loan and Purchase Rates: Sixty-one commented. TIj & ittle consensus on recommended loan and purchase rates with respect to the 1981 crop of feed grains and soybeans, but the majority preferred some type of increase. Corn loan rates varied from $2.25 per bushel to 100 percent of parity. Soybean loan rates varied from$5.02 per bushel to 90 to 100 percent of parity. Eighty-three percent of the responses to the producer association survey favored increases in th orn loan levels ranging from $2.35 tof,.pe.r bushel. 7. Barley and Oats in the Program: There were 73 comments on this pws-Vishmvith 5 favoring just barley in the program, 3 favoring just oats, and 42 suggested that both barley and oats be included. Twenty-three did not want barley or oats in the progam. 8. Compliance with the Normal Crop Acreage (NCA]: Seventy-two commented with 67 percent favoring required compliance with the farm NCA as a condition qf eligibility for program benefits. Thirty-seven percent of those surveyed by the producer association favor required compliance with the NCA. 9. Limitation on PlantedAcreage: Forty-nine commented, with 20 favoring a limitation; 7 are in favor if there is set- aside and 22 are not in favor of a limitation on planted acreage. 10. Rye: Two comments were received. One favored a $2.00 loan rate for rye, while the other favored a $3.00 loan rate.Eleven comments favored no feed grain program. Eight comments were received on offsetting compliance, with seven opposed and one in favor of offsetting compliance. All comments received were duly considered by the Secretary. Accordingly, the Secretary made determinations petaining to the 1981 crops of corn, sorghum, barley, oats, rye, and soybeans. These determinations were announced in a press release on November 14, 1980. The purpose of this notice is to affirm the determinations as previously announced. -Notice of Determinations 1. National program Acreages (NPA 's) for the 1981 Crops of Corn, Sorghum, and Barley. In accordance with section 105A(d)(1) of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, it is hereby proclaimed that NPA's for the 1981 crop of corn shall be 90.1 million acres sorghum, 15.4 million acres; and barley, 9,7 million acres. The national program acreages are based on the following data: Corn Sorghum Biley\" (a) Estimated domestic use. 1981-82.............. .5,030 (b) Estimated 835 (c) Plus .. ..2,.60 (d) Minus estimated Imports. .I (e) Plus stock adjustment' 880 (f) Dved by estimated na- tional weighted average farm program yield (bu ac.) ....... . 102 (g) Equals preliminary 1981NPA-....... 90.1 'a. 6.7 of 1980/81 world consumption of coarse grn, .. 1.480 b.

The national allocation factors will be determined prior to December 1981 for barely and April 1982 for corn and sorghum, 2. No Set-Aside for 1981 Crop Feed Grains. Section 105A(f)(1) of the 1949 Act provides that the Secretary shall provide for a set-aside of cropland if the7709677096 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. .n / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices Secretary determines that the total supply of feed grains is, in the absence of such a set-aside; likely to be excessive taking into account the need for and adequate carryover to maintain reasonable and stable supplies and prices and to meet a national emergency, Accordingly, it is hereby determined and proclaimed that no set- aside of cropland will be required for the 1981 crops of feed grains. In making the determinations as to set-aside in accordanoe with the statutory authority set forth above, the Secretary utilized the following economic data. The 19O/81 world feed grain production is forecast at 716 million metric tons (MMTI, down about 2- percent from the 1179180 leveL Combining production with beginning stocks results in total supply forecast at 805 MMT-about 1 percent below the 1979-80 level. Total utilization, estimated at 746 MMT, is 2.5 percent above the previous year. This leaves 59 MMT ending stocks, which are less than 8 percent of utilization and a third below the 197918 level. Total U.S. feed grain supplies (corn. sorghum, barley, and oats) for the 1980/ 81 marketing year (MY) are estimated at 245 MMT with utilization estimated at 223 MMT. This results in a 22 MMT carryover, compared with 52 MMT for 1979/80. With a season average price for corn estinmted to range from $3.30 to $3.75 a bushel, gross farm income from feed grain production, including program payments, is estimated at a record $26 billion-ma increase of $2.8 billion over the 1979/80 previous record. In 1981/82, more land is expected to be planted to feed grains, and with average weather, a significant annual increase in world production should occur. Assuming continued expansion in world livestock and poultry production, utilization will also rise, leaving 1981182 world ending stocks near this year's level U.S. feed grain acreage in 1981 with no set-aside program is expected to be 3 to 4 percent larger than 1980 feed grains planted acreage. Larger plantings are expected for corn. sorghum, and barley. with oats acreage about equaling the 1980 level Yields will likely exceed the drought reduced levels of 1980 but may not match the record level of 1979. With the increased acreage, production may be near the record 1979 level Feed use during 1981/82 could show a slight increase over 1980/81 depending on the response of the livestock and poultry sectors to higher grain prices and narrower feeding margins during 1981. U.S. feed grain exports in 1981/82 will likely continue to increase. Ending stocks are projected to remain atrelatively low levels and will be well below what is considered an excessive stocks position. As a result, prices should continue strong for the 1981 crop year. In 1960181, world soybean production is expected to be lower, but due to larger beginning stocks, total supply should decrease only about 5-percent to 99 MMT. Total U.S. soybean supplies for the 1980/81 MY are estimated at 58 MMT with utilization at 53 MMT. Carryover stocks are estimated at 4.5 MMT, 55 percent below the IM7/80 level With a season average price for soybeans estimated to range from $7.35 to $9,85 a bushel, gross farm income from soybean production is estimated at a record $15-0 billion-a 6-percent increase over the 1979/80 previous record. Given this outlook for feed grains and the corn-soybean relationship, it is determined that no set-aside is needed for the 1981 crop of feed grains. Such a determinatioa will allow farmers the flexibility to expand production to meet requirements. A set-aside program to reduce feed grain production could agravate an already tight supply-demand situation. Should supplies exceed current expectations, the farmer owned reserve program will be available to producers as a viable alternative to remove excess grain from the market. 3. 1981 Land Diversion. In view of the decision not to require a set-aside of cropland as a condition of eligibility for loans, purchases, and payments and in view of the fact that land diverson payments are not necessary to assist in adjusting the total national acreage of feed grains to desirable goals, no land diversion program as provided for by section 105A(f)(2) of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, will be implemented for the 1981 crop of feed grains. 4. Recommended Raduction from 1980 Planting for 181 Crops of Corn, Sorghum, and Barley. In accordance with section 105A(d)(3) of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, it is hereby determined and proclaimed that a zero percent reduction in acreage from that planted to corn. sorghum or barley on a farm for harvest in 1980 shall be applicable to the acreage of such crops planted for harvest in 1981 on such farm. The 190 acreage planted for harvest to such crops will include the acreage actually harvested plus any approved prevented planted acreage. With a zero percent reduction, producers who plant no more corn, sorghum or barley for 1961 harvest than was planted for harvest for each of those commodities in 1980 will beeligible for deficiency payments on the entire 1981 planted acreage of such crops, if in compliance with other program provisions. Th1s determination is based on the following data: Cam b13-0 poonrcs~-Od R~XA;- Pa 5r 0 5, 1981 Established \"Target\" icm The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1980 (Pub. L 96-213.approved March 18. 1980) amends section 105A(b)[1)IB) of the Agricultural Act of 1949. as amended, and provides that the 1M corn target price be not less than the 1980 target ($2.35), adjusted upward to reflect changes in the costs of producing corn as the Secretary finds necessary and appropriate for the purpose of' establishing and maintaining a fair and equitable relationship between loan rates, established prices, and production costs for corn and competing commodities. Target prices per bushel for the 1981 crops will not be less than $2.35 for corn; $2.50 for sorghum: and $2.55 for barley. Final target prices for these commodities will be annoumced by April 1,1962. It is hereby determined that the 1981-crop established \"target\" prices for corn. sorghum and barley will not be further increased pursuant to section 1001Mb] of the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977, as amended by the Agricultural Act of 1980, to compensate producers for not exceeding the established farm normal crop acreage (NCA). 6. 19601 Loan and Purchase Levels (Feed grains and Soybeans). In accordance with section 105Aa(1) of the Agricultural Act of 1949. as amended, it is hereby determined that the 1981 crop feed grain loan and purchase levels per bushel will be not less than $2.25 for corn, $2.14 [$3.82 per cwt.) for sorghum, $1.83 for barley. $1.16 for oats. and $1.91 for rye. The loan and purchase level for soybeans, as provided for by section 201(e) of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, will be not less than $3.02. Final determination will be made when supply prospects are clearer and with a further review of the farmer- owned reserve program objectives for the 1981 crop of feed grains.77097 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices 7. Inclusion of Barley and Oats in the Feed Grain Program. It is hereby determined that the 1981 crop barley will be included in the feed grain program and, therefore, a producer will be eligible for target price protection, price support loans and for participation in the farmer-owned reserve with respect to the 1981 crop of barley. It is also determined that 1981 crop oats will not be included in the' feed grain program. However, oats will be eligible for the 1981 loan and purchase program and the farmer-owned reserve program. 8. Compliance with Farm Normal .Crop Acreage (NCA) for Program Benefit Eligibility. Pursuant to section 1001(a) of the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977, as amended, it is hereby determined for the 1981 crop of feed grains that corn, sorghum and barley producers shall be required to plant within the established farm NCA as a condition of eligibility for loans, purchases and payments under the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended.

An, Environmental Impact Statement (EISJ for the Program was published on May 30,1973, discussing each class of oilr carrying vessel on which construction had started.or which was likely to be constructed' with the aid' ofi DS during the Tanker Construction Program.

Strict compliance with the pollution abatement provisiont of the, MarAd Standard Specifications for Merchant Ship Construction, as revised, were required, on all tankers, built with CDS. It also herd that CDS assistance would be considered' for retrofitting, tankers which were constructed' under the Program to incorporate anti- pollution features that are developed by' the U.S. Coast Guard, MarAd, or the Intergovenmental Maritime, Consultative Organization (IMCO.

All the vessels were constrqcted in compliance with the pollution abatement provisions of the MarAd Standard Specifications for Merchant Ship Construction (MarAd standard specifications) and with the plans and specifications of the National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO), which included provisions for special pollution controls. This class of vessel is described in the EIS as an example of an \"Intermediate Tanker\" and an \"Ore/ Bulk/Oil Carrier\" (OBO) in Section IL and the environmental impact of constructing such ships is covered throughout the HIS in various sections. Since the environmental impact of offering CDS assistance for the construction of these vessels has already been discussed fully in the EIS, and Docket A-75 provides for the use of CDS funds for retrofitting tankers with anti-pollution devices, the Board has decided that neither a new EIS nor a Supplement to the HIS is required with respect to these applications. The retrofitting, which is required by the PTSA and will be regulated by the U.S. Coast Guard, is expected to augment the pollution features already incorporated in the construction of the vessel and to reduce the potential for pollution of the marine environment.

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Environmental Impact Statement; Incidental Take of Dail Porpoise AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of IDtent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement SUMMARY: The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is issuing thisnotice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement will be prepared on the incidental take of Dall porpoise in the Japanese salmon fishery, and to invite participation in the scoping process on this issue. DATE: Comments are requested by December 5,1980. ADDRESS: Please address the individual identified below. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Mr. Richard B. Roe, Acting Director, Office of Marine Mammals and Endangered Species. National Marine Fisheries Service, Washington, D.C. 20235, Telephone: (202) 634-7481. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATIOW A three- year exemption from the incidental take permit requirements of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA) granted the Japanese salmon fishery in the North Pacific Ocean. and implemented by 1978 amendments to the North Pacific Fisheries Act of 1954 (NPFA), will expire in June 1981. Marine mammals, primarily the Dall porpoise, are taken in the course of commercial gillnet operations by Japanese fishing vessels within and outside the United States fishery conservation zone (FCZ) in the North Pacific and Bering Sea. An October 1980 report to the International North Pacific Fisheries Commission (INPFC) indicates that the incidental take of Dall porpoise (Phoooenoides da!i) in the Japanese mothership fishery in 1980 was approximately 7,234. Approximately 4,452 of these animals were estimated to have been taken with the FCZ, and 2782 outside our waters. The Dall porpoise population in the North Pacific and Bering Sea area is estimated at between 840,000 and 2.3 million animals. these estimates have a large variance because of small sample size and the limited amount of area that we were able to survey. A decision on whether to allow the Japanese fishery to take marine mammals within our waters should be communicated to the Japanese by April 1981, before they begin preparations for the 1981 fishing season. To ensure that our decision is made in accordance with the purposes and policies of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1989 (NEPA), NMFS will prepare a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) which contains a discussion of the environmental impacts of the following three alternative actions: (1) Issue a permit to the Japanese salmon fishery which allows the take of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations, according to the provisions of Section 103 of the MMPA (proposed action); (2) recommend legislative action to extend the permitexemption; and (3) no action (including impacts on Japanese participation in the INPFC). This notice of intent to prepare an EIS is being sent to appropriate Federal, State and local agencies and private organizations and individuals who may have an interest in this proposal. No formal scoping meeting is planned at this time. To ensure that the full range of actions, alternatives and impacts and all significant issues relating to a decision on this matter have been identified, we invite the participation of all interested parties in this scoping process, through comments and suggestions directed to the individual identified above.

SUMMARY: The Commission denies a petition requesting it to issue a consumer product safety standard requiring gas-fired heating furnaces to be equipped with a sealed combustion system and an automatic shut-off when hazardous conditions, such as release of carbon monoxide, occur. The Commision is taking this action because it does not believe that the mandatory standard requested by the petitioner is necessary or appropriate at this time to address any risk of injury presented by gas furnaces. The Commission notes that the problem of indoor air pollution is a broad one, involving combustion products from fuel-fired appliances in general. Commission staff has two research and evaluation projects scheduled on indoor air pollution. The Commission believes it is premature to mandate petitioner's remedy until other remedies in the context of the larger issue can be studied. ADDRES&. Copies of the petition and the staff's briefing materials on the petition may be obtained from the Office of the Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission, 1111 18th SL NW, Washington, D.C. 20207.

Background Section 10 of the Consumer Product Safety Act [CPSA) provides that any interested person pay petition the Consumer Product Safety Commissionto commence a proceeding for the issuance of a consumer product safety rule. Section 10 also provides that if the Commission denies such a petitlon, it shall publish its reasons for denial in the Federal Register. Buy letter dated January 8,1980. Albert Montague through th-Is attorney, Robert Kap!an. petiticred the Commission to issue a consumer product safety standard requiring gas- fired heating furnaces to be equipped with a sealed combustion system and an automatic thermal shut-off. (Petition CP8o-5 The petitioner contends that this standard is necessary because of the high incidence of carbon monoxide poisonings related to the use of gas-fired furnaces. The petitioner states that he has developed a sealed combustion system (the \"Bi-Loop\") which also contains an automatic thermal switch which operates to shut down the furnace when a hazardous condition arises. The letter from the petitioner's attorney also states that recent efforts to make residences air that because of energy concerns Is leading to internal pollution problems necessitating the use of sealed combustion furnaces in all homes.* The Commission notes that a sealed combustion system such as that suggested by the petitioner has two vents to the exterior of a dwelling, one of which provides intake air for combustion. Conventional gas furnaces, by contrast, have only one vent and draw air for combustion from the environment immediate to the furnace. 2. Commission Decision on the Petition Based on all available information. including information submitted by the pctitioner and information gathered by Commission staff, the Commission has decided to deny this petition. The reasons for the Commission's decision are discussed below. Information from the National Center for Health Statistics mortality files, the Commission's death certificate files, and the 1977 Housing Census indicates that during 1977 an estimated 80 deaths occurred as a result of carbon monoxdde poisoning from furnaces. The Commission staff estimates that 56 of 'An earler letter dha!d Octaer w. 19 fro Mr. Ka,-Tn on c! this cLent was not Led as a peliton because it ccrcened Lhe same risk and product Iaznay 8. 190 letter from Mr. Kaplan w3s determled to contain new Information. speciflcaly the recent effors to make residences air tight and the development of the sealed combustion\"Bi-Loop system.77105 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices these deaths may be attributed to gas furnaces based on the fact that 70 percent of all fuel-fired furnaces in use in 1977 were gas-fired. The staff notes, however, that gas furnace carbon monoxide deaths may actually be greater than the proportion of gas furnances in to all furnaces in use. This is because combustion products from gas-fired equipment, unlike those of oil- fired furnance, do not usually exhibit an odor which would warn of equipment malfunctions. From a review of the Commission's death certificate files for the 5 year period 1974-78, the staff concludes that there is no trend of increased carbon monoxide poisoning deaths which would support the petitioner's contention that recent efforts to make homes air tight have greatly increased the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning. Along similar lines, the Commission's engineering staff believes that with conventional techniques, it would not be possible to weatherize a home to the point where a properly functioning conventional gas-fired furnace would become hazardous. Despite the lack of any trends showing an increasing numer of carbon monoxide poisonings associated with gas furnaces, the Commission notes that the injury data in absolute terms appears to indicate that there is a problem with carbon monoxide poisoning from gas furnaces. In addition, the Commission points out that a staff\" analysis of in-depth investigations indicates that a sealed combustion system could be effective in preventing some carbon monoxide poisonings and deaths associated with gas furnaces, namely those incidents involving inadequate venting of flue products, including blocked vents and chimneys that are too low to provide a proper draft and air flow. The Commission believes, however, that any problem of carbon monoxide poisoning and gas furnaces should be addressed in the larger context of risks from combustion products from fuel- fired appliances in general. The Commission notes that it has scheduled a project (the \"Tighter Thermal Envelope\" project) to begin in Fiscal Year 1981 that, in cooperation with the Department of Energy .(D.O.E.], the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and other federal agencies, will examine the health effects of reduced air infiltration in homes, In addition, Commission staff plans to continue an ongoing study of consumer exposure to low levels of certain combustion .products. The Commission plans to test . fuel-fired appliances under conditions ofactual use to accurately measure the levels of carbon monoxide produced. The first product to be studied by the Commission will be the unvented gas- fired space heater. The Commission believes it would be premature at this time to mandate sealed combustion systems for gas-fired furnaces until other remedies such as carbon monoxide detectors or oxygen depletion sensors can be evaluated in the context of the larger issue of indoor air pollution and residential weatherization and the problems that may flow therefrom. Accordingly, the Commission has concluded that the mandatory standard suggested by the petitioner is not necessary or appropriate at this time address any risk of injury presented by gas furnaces and has denied the petition.

The purpose of these progress reports, the ninth of which appears below, is to provide an update on where agencies stand in this process and to inform interested persons of when to expect the publication of proposed procedures for their review and comment. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. C. Foster Knight, Acting General Counsel, Council on Environmental Quality, 722 Jackson Place, NW. Washington, D.C. 20006; 202-395-5750. Ninth Progress Report on Agency Implementing Procedures Under the National Environmental Policy Act At the direction of President Carter (Executive Order 11991], on November 29, 1978, the Council on Environmental Quality issued regulations implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"). These regulations appear at Volume 43 of the Federal Register, pages 55978-56007 and in volume 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, parts 1500- 1508. Their purpose is to reduce paperwork and delay associated with the environmental review process and to foster environmental quality through better decisions under NEPA. Section 1507.3 of the NEPA regulations provides that each agency of the Federal government shall adopt procedures to supplement the regulations. The purpose of agency \"implementing procedures,\" as they are called, is to translate the broad standards of the Council's regulations into practical action in Federal planning and decisionmaking. Agency procedures will provide government personnel with additional, more specific direction for implementing the procedural provisions of NEPA, and will inform tile public and State and local officials of how the NEPA regulations will be applied to individual Federal programs and activities. In the course of developing implementing procedures, agencies are required to consult with the Council and to publish proposed procedures in the Federal Register for public review and comment. Proposed procedures must be revised as necessary to respond to the ideas and suggestions made during the comment period. Thereafter, agencies are required to submit the proposed final version of their procedures for 30 day review by the Council for - conformity with the Act and the NEPA regulations. After making such changes as are indicated by the Council's review, agencies are required to promulgatetheir final procedures. Although CEQ's regulations required agencies to publish their procedures by July 30,1979 a number of Federal agencies did not meet this deadline. We stress, however, that the CEQ regulations are in effect now and are binding on all agencies of the Federal government now, whether or not the agencies are on time or late with their own procedures. The Council published its first progress report on agency implementing procedures on May 7,1979, its second report on July 23,1979, its third report on September 26, 1979, its fourth report on November 2,1979, its fifth report on December 14,1979, its sixth report on January 29,1980, its seventh report on March 25,1980, and its eight report on June 25,1980 (44 42786). The ninth progress report appears below. The Council hopes that concerned members of the public will review and comment upon agency procedures to insure that the reforms required by President Carter and by the Council's regulations are implemented.

The development of agency implementing procedures is a critical stage in Federal efforts to reform the NEPA process. These procedures must, of course, be consistent with the Council's regulations and provide the means for reducing paperwork and delay and producing better decisions in agency planning and decisionmaking. Interested persons will have the opportunity to make their suggestions for improving agency procedures when they are published in the Federal Register in proposed form. Broad public participation at this crucial juncture could go a long way toward ensuring that the goals of the NEPA regulations are widely implemented in the day-to- day activities of government. Prior to promulgation of final procedures, agencies are required to submit the proposed final version of their procedures to the Council for review. When the Council finds that an agency's procedures conform with NEPA and the NEPA regulations, the Council sends a letter of approval to the agency after which the agency may adopt and publish its procedures in final form. The following is an example of the approval letter. Honorable R. Max Peterson Chief Forest Service, Department of Agriculture, Washington. D.C. Dear Mr. Peterson Section 1507.3 of the Regulations for Implementating The Procedural Provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, 40 CFR 1500, et seq. provides that each agency shall as necessary adopt procedures to supplement the regulations. Section 1507.3 also provides that final agency procedures shall be adopted only after review by the Council on Environmental Quality. On June 12, 1979 your predecessor, Mr. John McGuire. transmitted for Council review final procedures developed by the Forest Service under Section 1507.3 of the NEPA regulations. These procedures were published in the Federal Register for public review and comment on April 29, 1979. The comment period on the procedures concluded May 31, 1979. The preamble to the procedures contains a point-by-point response to the major comments received on the procedures. The Council has completed its review of the procedures developed by the Forest Service. Based on that review, the Council has determined that the procedures address all of the sections of the regulations required to be addressed by Section 1507.3(b) of the regulations. The procedures will take effectand supplement the NEPA regulations once they are published In final form In the Federal Register. Yours truly, Nicholas C. Yost, General Counsel.

AOENCY* U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Albuquerque District. ACTION: Preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). SUMMARY: 1. ProposedAction and Alternatives: The authorized action considered by the EIS is the construction of setback levees on the west bank of a six mile stretch of the Arkansas River near Florence. Other authorized measures included dams on Coal and Oak Creeks and the diversion of Chandler Creek to the Oak Creek watershed. Along with the authorized project certain other measures were considered for Coal and Oak Creeks and the Arkansas River. These included various channel modifications to increase the capacities of Coal and Oak Creeks using concrete and gabion lined channels and non-structural measures in the Oak and Coal Creeks axid Arkansas77109 Federal Register / Vo. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 2T. 1960 / Notices River floodplains.

Telephone number (703) CODE 3810-71-M I Decis[ontTo Construct and Operate ar Atlantic Coast Strategic Submarine Base-at the Naval Submarine Support Base, Kings Bay, Georgia: Pursuant to the provisions of the regulations implementing the procedural provisions of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act (Part 1505.2 of. Title 40,, Code of Federal Regulations), the Department of the Navy announces its decisioni to, construct and operate a Strategic Submarine Base (SSB) at the Naval Submarine SupportBase, Kings Bay, Georgia. The decision will providefor the basing of one TRIDENT (orTRIDENT successor] submarine squadron, including strategic and defensive weapons storage and transfer, TRIDENT I1 missile production (if missile is approved), refit industrial support,complete refresher and off-crew trainingi waterfront support, possible administrative and personnel support, and on-base housing. Torpedo, maintenance and TRIDENT I missile production wilt remain in Charleston, South Carolina. Alternatives originally considered to Kings Bay as a potential Strategic Base were no action and four other candidate sites-. The, no-action alternative was considered unacceptable because of strategic defense needs. The four other candidate siting alternatives as discussed in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS] were Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island; Cheatham Annex, Virginia, Charleston, South Carolina; and Mosquito Lagoon, Florida. The previously'noted option for Kings Bay was selectecas the site of the base to best satisfy operational requirements and minimize environmental impacts for the ashore-based TRIDENT facility. Additional alternative basing studies for training, strategic weapons, defensive weapons and certain support facilities were conducted and Kings Bay was selected as the site of training, strategic and defensive weapons storage, and other related support functions and facilities while TRIDENTI missile production and torpedo maintenance will remain in Charleston, South Carolina. Alternatives were examined at Kings Bay with regard to placement of waterfront facilitfes, ashore facilities, and dredge disposal sites. The selected configurations and facility sites were chosen to minimize environmental impact within operational guidelines. Of the waterfront configurations considered, the form selected minimize dredging andloss of bay bottom area. Potential? development beyond the existing andproposed facilitleEwas also considered for an additional squadron of POSEIDON andior TRIDENT submarines. Based on comments received from the public and from Federal, state, andlocal agencies concerning the proposed action and the Draft Supplement EIS, the major environmental] effects of, or reservations expressed concerning, the proposed action are ross of habitat, both aquatic and terrestrial, potential effects upon. the Manatee andIndigo snake (as protected species], loss and/or alteration of wetlands andwooded. swamps, potential fiscal consequences to local governments, and alterations to the rural nature of theimmediate geographical area. Considerable effort has gone into reducing and minimizing the potential loss-of significant habitat during the master planning for facilities andton-77110 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices base operations. Additional commitments to mitigative measures have been included to offset the identified physical and socio-economic effects. Mitigating actions by the Navy to offset the results of dredging include construction of inshore reefs for oyster and aquatic feeding habitat, monitoring of dredging operations to manage poterltial effects upon water quality, seasonal restrictions on blasting for construction dredging, establishment of a manatee alert/watch-program as well as education and information programs for both contractor personnel and base- employed personnel. A positive result of the deeper bay habitat will be expected greater over-wintering protection of the white shrimp. Mitigating actions by the Navy to offset the effects of dredge material disposal include creation of waterfowl and nesting bird habitats within the disposal areas, funding of a survey to be conducted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service using the Habitat Evaluation Procedure (HEP) (and the development of a management plan based on the results of the HEP survey), use of an Indigo snake sighting program prior to constraction in possible snake areas and excavation and/or preservation of eligible archeological sites ha aocordance with Federal procedures. Mitigating actions by the Navy to offset the effects of facility construction include construction of retention ponds to reduce flow rates, and broad, flat drainage swales to offset the loss of on- site storage and existing vegetative buffer. Water quality monitoring will be expanded to include areas of A-1 development. The above mentioned HEP survey will also include the facility development areas. Wetlands and wooded swamps within proposed developed areas will be avoided and preserved to the extent practicable. Additionally, the Indigo snake survey program noted previously will be conducted prior to construction in snake areas. Along with the stated monitoring, survey and management programs, the Navy will maintain established contact with cognizant state and Federal agencies to assure enforcement of the mitigation commitments defined in the Final Supplement to the Environmental Impact Statement.Dated: November 17.1980.

The Confederated Tribes state that they did not have an opportunity to review the application until several months subsequent to the initial June 25, 1979. deadline for intervention. The Kootenai Tribe supports the Confederated Tribes in their assertion that the entire area of the proposed project \"is a vision quest site of deep religious significance to the Kootenai people.\" The Kootenai Tribes oppose the licensing of the project on the ground that it would desecrate the sanctity of the Kootenai River and surrounding area. The League of Women Voters of Montana state that they are interested in addressing energy development in alternatives to the proposed project. The League also expressed an interest in other matters. The Montana Wildlife Federation and the National Wildlife Federation (Federation) jointly petitioned to intervene and seek to maintain the Kootenai River in its free-flowing condition. Northern Lights filed separate pleadings opposing the intervention of the Confederated Tribes and the Kootenai Tribe. The applicant states that the area where the project would be located has considerable development already in place. The applicant also states that the proposed project should in no way interfere with the rights and interests of the Kootenai and other Indians at this site. The applicant also states that the interventions should be denied because they were filed late, particularly since the Tribes were aware of the proposed project as early as May 16, 1978. No opposition to the p0titions to intervene filed by the League and the Fedcration was received. Subsequent to Northern Lights' answer to the petitions to intervene filed by the Confederated Tribes and the Kootenai Tribe. the Lower Kootenai Band of Canada and Lucy Caye (Lower Kootenai Band) petitioned to intervene. The Lower Kootenai Band assert that the proposed project would have adverse environmental impacts in Canada and would affect their subsistence rights, aboriginal fishing. hunting and gathering rights, religious practices, and farming efforts. No opposition to the Lower Kootenai Band's petition was filed.77119 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices Ih addition, the Confederated Tribes and the Kootenai Tribe amended their petitions to intervene. The Confederated Tribes state that after reviewing Staff's draft environmental impact statement, they are now opposed-to the project on environmental grounds, its need, and economic viability. The Kootenai.Tribe also expanded its opposition to the project. The Kootenai Tribe now questions the need for the power and the project's economic feasibility. No opposition to the amended petitions was received. Participation by the above-named petitioners may be in the public interest. Pursuant to \u00a7 375.302, of the Commission's regulations, 45 FR 18 CFR 3.5(a) (1979), the above-named petitioners are permitted to intervene in this proceeding subject to the Commission's Rules and Regulations under the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. 791(a)-825(r]. Participation of the Intervenors shall be limited to matters affecting rights and interests specifically set forth in their petition to intervene. The admission of the Intervenors shall not be construed as recognition by the Commission that they might be aggrieved by any order entered in this proceeding. Kenneth F. Plumb, Secretary.

AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of applicability. SUMMARY: Applicability of New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) under the Clean Air Act has been determined as indicated below.' Vickers Petroleum Corporation Vickers Petroleum proposes to construct, at their Ardmore, Oklahoma, refinery, two new floating roof storage tanks. The proposed tanks No. 131 and 132 will store 125,000 barrels and 80,000 barrels of gasoline respectively. New Source Performance Standards (40 CFR Part 60, SubpartKa) have been promulgated to regulate the emission of volatile organic compounds VOC) into the atmosphere from petroleum storage vessels. Under these regulations petroleum storage vessels with a capacity of 151,412 liters (40,000 gallons) or greater storing VOC, except fuel oils numbers 2-6, must meet the control requirements. Since these tanks will store VOC other than number 2-6 fuel oil and have capacities exceeding 151,412 liters, they aresubject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 60 Subpart Ka. Houston Industries, Inc./ARCO Petroleum Products Company, Houston, Ship Channel Cogeneration Project Houston Industries and ARCO Petroleum Products, in a cooperative effort, propose to develop a major cogeneration project to generate power and steam at a single site located on the Houston Ship Channel using solid alternate fuel(s) as defined in the Power Plant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978. High pressure steam will be expanded to generate approximately 170 megawattas of electrical capacity for the Houston Lighting and Power Companygrid. The expanded low pressure process steam, approximately 3.5 million pounds per hour, will be sold to industrial consumers. The project will make use of three 3,000 million B.T.U, per hour fossil fuel-fired steam generators. The primary fuel will be petroleum coke combined with heavy fuel oil as necessary to sustain combustion of the coke. New Source Performance Standards (40 CFR Part 60, Subpart Da) have been promulgated to regulate the emission of particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NO1) into the. atmosphere from electric utility steam generating units. Under these regulations, electric utility steam generating units capable of combusting more than 73 megawatts (250 million BTU/hr) heat input 6f fossil fuel which commenced construction or modification after September 18, 1078, must meet the requirements of 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart Da. Since this project will have electric utility steam generators with a heat input exceeding 73 megawatts, they must meet the requirements of 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart Da. County of Saline Saline County has installed a new asphalt concrete plant at Benton, Arkansas. The plant will produce approxinately 48,000 tons per year of asphaltic paving materials. New Source Performance Standards (40 CFR Part 00, Subpart I) have been promulgated to regulate the emission of particulate matter into the atmosphere from Asphalt Concrete plants constructed or modified after June 11, 1973. Such plants must meet-the requirements of this subpart, Since this plant was put Into operation after this date it is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart I. Texas Refining Company Texas Refining Company proposes to construct a petroleum topping unit at Midland, Texas. The facility will consist of a crude oil heater unit and four 420,000 gallon storage tanks. New Source Performance Standards (40 CFR Part 60, Subpart Ka), have been promulgated to regulate the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) into the atmosphere from petroleum storage vessels. Under these regulations petroleum storage vessels with a capacity of 151,412 liters (40,000 gallons) or greater storing VOC, except fuel oils number 2-6, must meet the requirements of 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart Ka. Since these tanks will store VOC other than number 2-6 fuel oil and have capacities exceeding 151,512 liters, they are subject77122 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart Ka. Cities Service Company Cities Service Company proposes to construct a hydrocarbon fractionation facility near Mont Belvieu, Texas. The facility will consist of two 150 million B.T.U. per hour heat input process heaters, eight 1,000 horsepower gas turbines, eight 105,000 gallon pressurized storage vessels, and an emergency plant flare. New Source Performance Standards (40 CFR Part 60, Subpart GG), have been promulgated to regulate the emission of nitrogen oxides (NO.) and sulfur dioxide (SO,) into the atmosphere from stationary gas turbines. Under these regulations stationary gas turbines constructed after September 10, 1979, with a heat input at peak load equal to or greater than 10.7 gigajoules per hour (which is approximately equal to 1,000 lp output), based on the lower heating value of the fuel fired, must meet the requirements of this subpart. Since the eight turbines are rated at 1,000 lp each they are subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart GG. DATES: Under Section 307(b)(i) of the Clean Air Act, judicial review of this action is available only by the filing of a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit within 60 days of today. Under Section 307(b)(2) of the Clean Air Act, the requirements which are the subject of this notice may not be challenged later in civil or criminal proceedings brought by EPA to enforce these requirements.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Rick Green, Chemical Control Division (TS-794), Office of Pesticides and ToxicSubstances, Environmental Pro.tection Agency, Rm. E-221, 401 M St. SW., Washington, D.C. 20460 (202-426-3980]. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 5(a)(1] of TSCA [90 Stat. 2012 (15 U.S.C. 2604),- requires any person who intends to manufacture or import a new chemical substance to submit a PMN to EPA at least 90 days before manufacture or import commences. A \"new\" chemical substance is any substance that is not on the Inventory of existing substances compiled by EPA under. section 8(b) of TSCA. EPA first published the Initial Inventory on June 1, 1979. Notices of availability of theInventory were published in the Federal Register of May 15, 1979 (44 FR 28558- Initial) and July 29, 1980 (45 FR 505444- Revised). The requirement to submit a PMN for new chemical substances manufactured or imported for commercial purposes became effective on July 1, 1979. EPA has proposed premanufacture notification rules and forms in the Federal Register issues of January 10, 1979 (44 FR 2242] and October 16, 1979 (44 FR 59764). These regulations, however, are not yet in effect. Interested persons should consult the Agency's Interim Policy published in the Federal Register of May 15, 1979 (44 FR 28564) for guidance concerning premanufacture notification requirements prior to the effective date of these rules and forms. In particular, see page 28567 of the Interim Policy. A PMN must include the information listed in section 5(d)(1) of TSCA. Under section 5(d)(2) EPA must publish in theFederal Registernonconfidential information on the identity and use(s) of the substance, as well as a description of any test data submitted under section 5(b). In addition, EPA has decided topublish a description of any test data submitted with the PMN and EPA will publish the identity of the submitter unless this information is claimed confidential. Publication of the sdction 5(d)(2) notice is subject to section 14 concerning disclosure of confidential information. A company can claimconfidentiality for any information submitted as part of a PMN. If the company claims confidentiality for the specific chemical identity or use(s) of the chemical, EPA encourages the submitterto provide a generic use description, a nonconfidential description of the potential exposures from use, and'a generic name for the chemical. EPA will publish the generic name, the generic use(s), and the potential exposure descriptions in the 'Federal Register. If no generic usQ description or generic name is provided, EPA will develop one and after providing due notice to the submitter, will publish an amended Federal Register notice. EPA immediately will review confidentiality claims for chemical identity, chemical use, the identity of the submitter, and for health and safety studies. If EPA determines that portions of this information are not entitled to confidential treatment, the Agency will publish an amended n6tice and will place the information in the public file, after notifying the submitter and complying with other applicable procedures. After receipt, EPA has 90 days to review a PMN under section 5(a)(1). The section 5(d)(2) Federal Register notice indicates the date when the review period ends for each PMN. Under section 5(c), EPA may, for good cause, extend the review period for up to an additional 90 days. If EPA determines that an extension is necessary, it will publish a notice in. the Federal Register. Once the-review period ends, the submitter may manufacture the substance unless EPA has imposed restrictions. When the submitter beginsto manufacture the substance, he must report to EPA, and the Agency will add the substance to the Inventory. After the substance is added to the Inventory, any company may manufacture It without providing EPA notice under section 5(a)(1)[A). Therefore, under the Toxic Substances Control Act, summaries of the data taken from the PMN's are published herein. Interested persons may, on or before December 20,1980 submit to the Document Control Officer (TS-793), Management Support Division, Office of Pesticides and Toxic Substances, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm.

IFR D Pennsylvania; Issuance of Specific Exemptions To Use Mesurol on Grapes AGENCY:. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA has granted specific exemptions to the Maryland. Oregon, and Pennsylvania Departments of Agriculture (hereafter referred to as \"Maryland\". \"Pennsylvania'\", \"Oregon\",or the \"Applicants\") to use Mesurol to control depredating birds on 300 acres of grapes in Maryland, 800 acres in Oregon, and 1.500 acres in Pennsylvania. The specific exemptions are issued under the Federal Insec'ticide, Fungicide, and RodenticideAcL Oregon's and expire on November 30. 1980 FOR FURTHER WFORMATION COTACT: Donald R. Stubbs, Registration Division (TS-787), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmentdl Proiection Agency, Rm. E-124, 401 M St.. SW., Washington. D.C. 20W4 (202-426-0223). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:. According to the Applicants. birds can seriuusly reduce the crop of marketable grapes. The amount of injury varies from year to year. reflecting bird populations and availability of alternative food sources. Grapes are generally harvested after other berry crops and thus can bucome a major food source for birds. Grapes are subject to feeding at all times after the fruit has begun to ripem Bird species observed in grape fields inGlude robins, finches, starlings, sparrows, mourning doves, orioles. cedar waxwings, and blackbirds. There are currently no pesticides registered for bird control in grapes. There are two types of alternative control a% ailable: (a) scare devices. and Ib) exclusion devices. According to the Applicants, scare devices do not prevent, but only reduce, feeding injury; some birds quickly adapt to these de%. ices. The Applicants claim that exclusion devices are prohibitively expensive. Mesurol is currently registered as a bird repellent on dbr'ries. The Applicants propose to apply from 2.67 to 5.33 pounds of Mesurol. which contains the active ingredient (a.i.] 3,5- dimethyl4-[methylthio) phenyl methylcarbamate, per acre with up to three applications. The Applicants anticipate that grape growers in Maryland may lose up 1 251 ---- 1-10 251 ---- 251 1.-IQ77127 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices in Oregon up to $100,000, and those in Pennsylvania from $150 to $300 per ton on wine grapes, and $250 to $350 per ton on table grapes, if Mesurol is not available. EPA has determined that residues of the a.i. and its cholinesterase-inhibiting metabolites would not exceed 10 parts per million (ppm) in or on grapes, 20 PPM in or on raisins, and 50 ppm in or on grape pomace and raisin waste, from the proposed use. These residue levels have been judged adequate by EPA to protect the public health. EPA has also determined that the proposed use should not present an undue hazard to the environment. After reviewing the applications and other available information, EPA has determined that the criteria for exemptions have been met. Accordingly, Oregon and Pennsylvania have been granted specific exemptions to use the pesticide noted above until November 30, 1980, and Maryland until October 30, 1980, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the applications. The specific exemptions are also subject to the following conditions: 1. The product Mesurol 75% WP insecticide-bird repellent, EPA Reg. No. 3125-288, may be used. -2. Maryland may apply Mesurol by ground equipment at a rate of 2.67 pounds (2.0 pounds a.i.] per acre; Oregon may apply Mesurol at a rate of 2.67 to 5.33 pounds of product (2.0 to 4.0 pounds a.i.) per acre using air or groind equipment; and Pennsylvania may apply Mesurol at a rate of 2.0 to 5.33 pounds of product (2.0 to 4.0 a.i.) per acre using ground equipment. No more that three applications may be made per season. 3. Application of Mesurol is restricted to those grape fields where damage-from bird depredation will cause significant economic losses, as determined by Cooperative Extension or authorized 'State personnel. 4. Application is to begin at the first sign of major bird damage. A one-day pre-harvest interval is imposed. 5. In Maryland, a total of 1,200 pounds a.d. are authQrized to treat up to 300. acres. In Oregon, a total of 9,600 pounds a.i. are authorized to treat up to 800 acres. In Pennsylvania, a total of 18,000 pounds a.i. areauthorized to treat up to 1,500 acres. 6. Mesurol is toxic to fish and other aquatic organisms. Precautions must be taken to avoid or minimize spray drift to aquatic areas. 7. Mesurol is highly toxic io bees exposed to direct treatment or residues on crops or blooming weeds. It may not be applied or allowed to drift to crops or weeds when bees are actively visiting the area.8. All applicable directions, restrictions, and precautions on the registered label must be followed. 9. Residues of the a.i. and its cholinesterase-inhibiting metabolites not exceeding the following levels may enter Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has been notified of these actions. 10. Each of the Applicants is responsible for assuring that all of the provisions of that State's specific exemption are met and must submit a final report summarizing the results of this program by February 28, 1981.

ADDRESS: Requests for copies of the summary of safety and effectiveness data and petitions for administrative review may be sent to the Dockets Management Branch (formerly the Hearing Clerk's office) (HFA-305), Foodand Administration, Rm. 4-62, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT Henry Goldstein, Bureau of Medical Devices (HFK-402), Food and Drug Administration, 8757 Georgia Ave., Silver Spring, MD 0910, 301-427-8162. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The sponsor, Allergan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Irvine, CA, submitted an application for premarket approval of the Allergan SoflensTM Cleaning and Soaking Solution for polymacon hydrophilic contact lenses to FDA on September 11, 1975. The application was reviewed by the Ophthalmic Device Section of the Ophthalmic; Ear, Nose, and Throat; and Dental Devices Panel, an FDA advisory committee, which recommended approval of the application. On October 3, 1980, FDA approved the application by a letter to the sponsor from the Acting Director of the Bureau of Medical Devices. Before enactment of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 tthe amendments) (Pub. L. 94-219, 90 Stat, 539-583), soft contact lens solutions were regulated as new drugs. Because the amendments broadened the definition of the term \"device\" in section 101(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.SC. 321(h)), soft contact lens solutions are now regulated as class III devices (premarket approval). As FDA explained in a notice published in the Federal Register of December 16,1977 (42 FR 63472), the amendments provide transitional provisions to ensure continuation of premarket approval requirements for class III devices formerly considered new drugs. Furthermore, FDA requires, as a condition to approval, that sponsors of applications for premarket approval of soft contact lenses or solutions comply with the records and reports provisions of Part 310 (21 CFR Part 310), Subpart D, until these provisions are replaced by similar requirements under the amendments. A summary of the safety and effecti eness data on which FDA's approval is based is on file in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) and is available upon request from that office. Requests should be identified with the name of the device and the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. The labeling of the SoflensTm Cleaning and Soaking Solution states that the solution is designed for daily use to clean, hydrate, and disinfect polymacon contact lenses. Sponsors of any soft (hydrophlic) contact lenses that have been approved for marketing areadvised that whenever FDA publishes a notice in the Federal Register of the agency's approval of a new solution for use with an approved soft contact lens, the sponsor of each lens shall correct its labeling to refer to the new solution, at the next printing or at such other time as FDA prescribes by letter to the sponsor. A sponsor who fails to update the restrictive labeling may violate the misbranding provisions of section 502 of the act (21 U.S.C. 352) as well as the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41-581, as amended by the Magnuson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act (Pub. L. 93-637). Furthermore, failure to update the restrictive labeling to refer to new solutions that may be used with an approved lens may be grounds for withdrawing approval of the application for the lens, under section 515(eJ(1J(F) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360(e)(1][Ff9. Opportunity for Administrative Reiew Section 515[d)(3) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(d)(3)) authorizes any interested person to petition, under section 5151g) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360efg)), for administrative review of FDA's decision to approve this application.

SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in accordance with the Infant Formula Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-359) is establishing the content of and the format by which all reports by manufacturers of infant formulas are to be submitted to FDA. This notice designates the types of Information required to be submitted, the time when such information is to be submitted, and the offices in FDA where such reports are to be sent. The purpose of the reporting requirements is to ensure compliance with the 1980 Infant Formula Act. ADDRESS: Manufacturers of infant formulas are to submit the required reports to Chief, Regulatory Affairs Staff (HFF-204), Bureau of Foods, Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:.F. Edward Scarbrough,'Bureau of Foods (HFF-204), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204,202-245-3117. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In 1978 a major manufacturer of soy protein- based infant formulas reformulated its soy product line. This reformulation resulted in products containing an inadequate amount of the essential nutrient, chloride. By mid-1979 substantial numbers of cases of hypochloremic metabolic'alkalosis in infants, characterized by a failure to thrive, were diagnosed. Most of these cases were associated with prolonged exclusive uses of these brands of infant formulas. Thus, it became apparent that greater control over the formulation and production of ifant formulas was necessary. Accordingly, Congress passed and the President signed into law on September 26, 1980, the Infant Formula Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 98-359, 94 Stat. 1190). This amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) establishes a new section 412 (21 U.S.C. 350a) which specifies more stringent control over infant formula manufacturing and processing. It also provides for certain notification to the FDA from infant formula manufacturers. This notice addresses the reporting requirements of section 412 (b) and (c) of the act and reporting exemptions under section 412(f) for certain formulas. Section 412(b)(1) of the act requires manufacturers to notify FDA within 90 days following the date of its enactment [December 26, 1980) and on each 90th day thereafter, that each infant formula produced by the manufacturer for commercial or charitable distribution for human consumption provides the nutrients required by section 412(g) of the act. This notification requirement will expire upon the effective date of the quality control and assurance procedukal regulations which FDA will be proposing in the Federal Register in the near future. Infant formulas falling into this category are deemed to be\"existing\" formulations if they are identical to those in commercial use on or before December 26, 1980 and are still being manufactured after December 26, 1980. Section 412(b)(2) of the act requires manufacturers to notify FDA, not later than the 90th day before the first processing of any infant formula for commercial or charitable distribution for human consumption that any \"new\" infant formula provides the nutrients required by section 412(g) of the act: \"New\" infant formulas are those newly developed formulations placed in commercial use after December 26, 1980and which are not reformulations within the meaning of section 412(b)(3). Section 412(b)(3) of the act requires manufacturers, before the first processing of any infant formula for commercial or charitable distribution for human consumption, when the.. manufacturer deternidnes that a change in its/formulation or a change In Its processing may affect whether the formula is adulterated under section 412(a)(1), to notify FDA of such changes and that the new formulation provides the nutrients required by section 412(g) of the act. \"Reformulated\" infant formulas are those in which a change In processing or a change in formulation occurred with respect to infant formulas in commercial use after December 20, 1980. S~ction 412(c).of the act requires _manufacturers to promptly notify FDA when they have knowlede, as defined In section 412(c)(2) of the act, that an infant formula which has been processed by the manufacturer and -which is in the marketplace may not provide the required nutrients or is otherwise adulterated or misbranded and, if so adulterated or misbranded, presents a health risk. Section 412(fo of the act provides an exemption from the adulteration provisions of section 412(a) for any infant formula which is represented and labeled for use by an infant who has an inborn error of metabolism or a low birth weight, or who otherwise has an unusual medical or dietary problem. Such unusual iedical conditions include, but are not limited to, Infants suffering from phenylketonuria or severe kidney diseases. These conditions require formulas specifically tailored to the infants' medical needs. See S. Rept. No. 96-916, 96th Cong., 2d Sess,, p. 10 (1980). Such formulas are also exempt from the notification requirements of section 412 (b) and (c)(1)(A) of the act. However, these formulas are not exempt from the other requirements of section 412, or the other applicable sections of the act. For the purpose of this notice FDA believes that infant formulas, unless limited to a specific population because of a special dietary or medical need, are not exempted from the reporting requirements of section 412. These nonexempt formulas are readily available to the general public, and include those for infants with conditions such as milk or other food allergies, digestive enzyme deficiencies which cause intolerances to food components such as carbohydrates, and malabsorption problems such as those related to the intestinal absorption of some food fats. Thus, FDA expects thatii ,. ... ... ... ... __J u nw77136 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 1 Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices all the required reports covered by this notice will be submitted for these types of infant formula products. FDA will be proposing regulations defining the precise terms and conditions of the exemption for formulas in the near future. In the meantime, questions concerning this exemption should be sent to Chief, Regulatory Affairs Staff, at the address above. A.

Palo77137 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices ' Alto, CA, submitted an application for premarket approval of CSI T (Crofilcon A) Hydrophilic Contact Lens to FDA on June 15,1979. The application was reviewed by the Ophthalmic Device Section of the Ophthalmic; Ear, Nose, and Throat; and Dental Devices Panel, an FDA advisory committee, which recommended approval of the application. On September 19, 1980, FDA approved the application by a letter to the sponsor from the Acting Director of the Bureau of Medical Devices. Before enactment of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (the amendments) (Pub. L, 94-295, 90 Stat. 539-583), soft contact lenses and solutions were regulated as new drugs. Because the amendments broadened the definition of the term \"device\" in section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic-Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321(h)), soft contact lenses and solutions are now regulated as class III devices '(premarket approval). As FDA explained in a notice published in the Federal Register of December 16, 1977 (42 FR 63472), the amendments provide transitional provisions to ensure continuation of premarket approval . requirements for class Ill devices' formerly regulated as new drugs. Furthermore, FDA requires, as a condition to approval, that sponsors of applications for premarket approval of soft contact lenses or solutions comply with the records and reports provisions of Part 310 (21 CFR Part 310), Subpart D, until these provisions are replaced by similar requirements under the amendments. A summary of the safety and effectiveness data on which FDA's approval is based is on file with the Dockets Management Branch (address above) and is available upon request from that office. Requests should be identified with the name of the device and the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. The labeling of an approved contact lens states that the lens is to be used only with certain solutions for disinfection and other purposes. The\" restrictive labeling informs new users that they must avoid using certain products, such as solutions intended for use with hard contact lenses. However, the restrictive labeling needs to be updated periodically to refer to new lens solutions that FDA approves for use with an approved contact lens: A sponsor who fails to update the restrictive labeling may violate the misbranding provisions of section 502 of the act (21 U.S.C. 352) as well as the Federal Trade Commission Act (15U.S.C. 41-58), as amended by the Magnuson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act (Pub. L. 93-637). Furthermore, falure to update the restrictive labeling to refer to new solutions that may be used with an approved lens may be grounds for withdrawing approval of the application for the lens, under section 515(e)(1](F) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(e)(1)(F)). Accordingly, whenever FDA publishes a notice in the Federal Register of the agency's approval of a new solution for use with an approved lens, the sponsor of the lens shall correct its labeling to refer to the new solution at the next printing or at any other time FDA prescribes by letter to the sponsor. Opportunity for Administrative Review Section 515(d)(3) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(d)(3)) authorizes any interested person to petition, under section 515(g) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(g)) for administrative review of FDA's decision to approve this application. A petitioner may request either a formal hearing under Part 12 (21 CFR Part 12) of FDA's administrative practices and procedures regulations or a review of the application and FDA's action by an independent advisory committee of experts. A petition is to be in the form of a petition for reconsideration of FDA action under \u00a7'10.33(b) (21 CFR 10.33(b)). A petitioner shall identify the form of review requested (hearing or independent advisory ccmmittee),and shall submit with the petition supporting data and information showing that there is a genuine and substantial issue of material fact for resolution through administrative review.

SUBJECT: Announcement of Availability of Funds for the Research and Development Projects in Aging Program. SUMMARY: The Administration on Aging (AoA) announces that applications are being accepted for the Research and Development Projects in Aging Program authorized by Title IV, Part B of the Older Americans Act of 1965, as amended (42 USC Sec. 3001, et. seq.) DATES: Closing date for receipt of applications is: Janaury 23,1981. Scope of This Announcement This announcement relates only to the discretionary grants program conducted by the Adruirstration on Aging under the Research and Development Projects in Aging Program, Title IV, Part B of the Older Americans Act. The Administration on Aging also administers discretionary grant programs in education and training, long-term care and model projects on aging. The announcement covers funding priorities for the Fiscal Year 1981. For further information, consult the Research and Development Guidelines, Division of Research, Administration on Aging, Room 3280 HHS North Building, 330 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, D.C. 20201. Program Purpose The Research and Development Projects in Ag Program is the foundation of AoA knowledge building cfforts, The purpose of this program is to award grants which will contribute to the well.being of the elderly by: (1) ldentif ing and studying current77139 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices patterns and factors that affect the'lives of older persons; and (2) developing, demonstrating, and evaluating approaches and methods for improving the life circumstances of older persons. This program gives particular attention to the needs of the very old and impaired whose problems are aggravated by social isolation, low income, rural residence, and minority status. Programs Goals and Objectives The goal of the Research and Development Program authorized in Title IV-B of the Older Americans Act is to build policy and program relevant knowledge in support of three (3) objectives: 1. Understanding the needs and conditions of older persons; 2. Developing or modifying public and private policies to improve the life circumstances of older persons; 3. Developing and implementing comprehensive and coordinated community based service systems for older persons. Special Considerations The Fiscal Year 1981 research - program will-be limited to research projects in the following two categories: Concept and Option Papers-which analyze existing information in the light of current and future policy and practice, and identify alternative strategies for addressing major social problems. Proposals for a series of such papers from one researcher, or from a group of researchers, which show promise of analyzing a particular issue from differing theoretical perspectives, will also be considered for funding, . providing that the total budget is not in excess of $75,000. Small-Scale Data Collection or Data Analysis Products-which may extend an existing research project or further analyze existing data; policy relevant case studies, pilot studies, or other exploratory research designs in pursuit of specific research objectives relevant to the AoA policy issues and concerns. The amounts indicated as available and the number of awards anticipated should be considered as suggestive, not restrictive, although AoA expects awards generally to reflect these projections. Proposals are expected to address to the fullest extent possible the major social issues of the Department including: strengthening the place of the aged person in the family; assisting recent immigrants who are aged in their adjustment to American society; and targeting public resources toward the efficient management of social servicesystems, and the specific needs of sub- populations among the aged. These priority sub-populations include: low- income and minority aged; the aged in. rural areas; physically and mentally impaired aged;'aged with special social needs, inciluding recent immigrants, migrants and seasonal farnworkers; aged women living alone; and other low- income oxtunderserved older persons. In addition, the 1978 Amendments to the Older Americans Act place emphasis on meeting the unique needs of the elderly living in rural settings and assuring that the needs of minority aged are addressed. Therefore, applications in response to any policy issue identified below which are limited in scope to the rural elderly or the minority elderly -Al receive consideration for funding, when such limitation is judged to be appropriate. AoA particularly encourages and the Commissioner on Aging will give special consideration to applications submitted by eligible applicants for projects to be, conducted by minority researchers within the framework of the priorities for research identified herein. This preference applies with reference to the following four minority groups: Black, Hispanic, Asian-American, and American Indian. Areas for Which Proposals Are Solicited In Fiscal Year 1981 the program is focused on policy concerns organized around the following three themes, or broad issue areas: 1. Impact of Aing on Society 2. The Elderly as a Resource 3. Services to Facilitate Well-Being of the Elderly In each of the three themes, AoA has identified the following policy issues which applicants are expected to address in their proposals. Applicants may address more than one policy issue. However, each application should be limited to issues within one theme. A researcher may submit an application which deals with policy issues not specified by AoA, or offers a rephrased or redirected version of a . specified policy issue. Such applications will compete against all other applications submitted. Theme 1. Impact of Aging on Society 1-A. Effects upon the aged family member of increased numbers of women in the workforce, from the perspective of availability and capacity of informal supports; and implications for changing demands on the formal service system. 1-B. Projected needs for, and supply of, acute and chronic care services including availability of manpower.1-C.

The Commissioner on Aging will make the final decision on each grant application for this program. Applications which are complete and conform to the requirements of this program announcement will be considered. All conforming grant applications are subject to a comprehensive review and evaluation by qualified reviewers who are not employees of the Administration on Aging. For purposes of the review process, proposals are classified into two categories: (1) data collection and data analysis projects; (2) concept or option papers. Both categories of proposals will be reviewed by two separate review panels. The first panel (technical review panel] will judge the technical merits of proposals using two different sets of criteria, one set for data collection and analysis projects and one set for concept and option papers, as described below. Proposals recommended for funding by the technical review panel will be submitted to the second review panel (program and policy relevance .review panel) for an assessment of their program and policy relevance. This second review panel will rate all proposals using an additional set of criteria for this purpose, as described below. The outcome of this second review will be a final set of recommendations which the Commissioner on Aging will use in making funding decisions. The Commissioner will take into account the recommendations of thereviewers, the comments of the State Agencies on Aging and the Regional AoA Offices, and the recommendations of AoA staff. Comments on the application may also be requested from appropriate specialists and consultants inside and outside of government. The Commissioner will endeavor to balance awards among the three theme areas. Unsuccessful applicants will be notified in writing. Successful applicants will be notified through the issuance of a Notice of Grant Awarded. This notice sets forth the amount of funds granted, the purpose of the grant, the terms and conditions of the grant award, the total grantee participation for the budget period, the effective date of the award, and the budget period for which support is given.

The Center would be expected to plan and conduct a broad program of basic and policy research on the nature, causes and effects of poverty. This grant will replace the core grant which has been made non- competitively to the Institute for Research on Poverty by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (now Health and Human Services) for the past seven years.A. Type of Application Requested This announcement seeks applications for a grant to develop and conduct an inter-disciplinary program of quantitative and qualitative research on the determinants of economic inequality and related social problems. The program will include basic research Into the nature, caunes, and effects of changes in the distribution of Income, mobility patterns, and the incidence of poverty. The program will also include policy research into the effects of specific government programs on the income distribution, economic mobility, and the incidence of poverty, and the ability of alternative approaches to reduce the amount of poverty, encourage mobility, or alleviate the effects of low income. 1. Research Program. The Center will be expected to plan, Initiate and maintain a poverty research program of high caliber. This should Include supporting the work of members of the Center staff, as well as providing intellectual leadership in the research community by establishing links with a broad range of other scholars studying poverty issues, through visiting and postdoctoral appointments, research agendas, conferences and seminars, publications, and a limited program of nonresident grants, for example. The research program should include the approaches of several disciplines to increase the understanding of the issues beyond what is possible from analysis within the framework of a slngie discipline. At a minimum, the staff should include competency in economics and sociology, along with at least two other disciplines. The research program should also include a mixture of quantitative and qualitative research projects. Quantitative research that involves the collection of data and its statistical analysis must be complemented by qualitative research that Involves case studies and analyses of the structure of institutions and markets, theoretical analyses (based on both quantitative research findings and case studies) of the economic, social, and political processes and institutions that together generate economic inequality, and discussions of the policy'implicatons of research findings. It is expected that the research program will support work that produces major advances at the frontiers of knowledge In the poverty field. It is, for example, appropriate to consider use of the grant to make advances in research techniques, where they are needed for or related to poverty research.77144 Federal Register / Vol. 46, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices 'Io assure the quality of the research and a careful examination of the output of the Center within the academic community, the Center must establish and maintain a formal tie with a university, including links with relevant departments within that university. The applications should discuss how those links will be assured. It is also important that the continuity of the poverty research program supported by Community Service Act funds be maintained; hence the application should specify in detail how administrative arrangements will be made to ninmize start-up and transition delays. In general, the work of the Center will be self-initiated and self- directed. However, the Assistant Secretary (or his or her designee) must approve the plans for the year s research before expenditures from the grant for that year can be made; and the Center and its staff members may from time to time be asked to comment on research plans, serve on panels to evaluate research proposals, and provide critical commentary on research products. 2- Content and Organization of Application. The application must begin with the required application forms and a three to five page overview and summary of the application. Staff resumes should be included in a separate appendix. The central core of the application must contain four sections, presented in the following order: (a) An analysis of the nature, causes, and effects of recent changes in the income distribution, individual mobility within the overall distribution and the incidence of poverty. The analysis should discuss both the factual evidence on changes and research on the causes and effects of the changes. The discussion should emphasize (bat not necessarily be limited to) the past. twenty years. It should in no way be limited tu a discussion of the contrib~utions that have been made by the Instr;7e for Research on Poverty althougp it should not, of course, ignore those contributions. Examples of the kinds of issues that should be discussed include the effects of demographic trends Lchanges in fertility, marital stability, and migration, for example), the effects of inflation, the effects of changing rates of aggregate and sectoral economc growth and related shifs in the location and types of jobs available, the effects of the growth of fringe benefits as part of total compensation, the effects of alterations in government transfer, tax, employment, and macroeconomic stabilization policies,and the effects of these developments and the resulting changes in economic inequality on existing government programs and the demand for new or revised programs. (b) A prvspectas for pov-eity research. outlining the major poverty research themes to be articulated over the nrxt seven years. The pruspectus should discuss the kind of poverty r, iarch activities that are needea fo an'vcpate future policy debutes and the role of the proposed Poverty Re~earch Cn-er in promoting those at tivities. The prospectus should not assume vintlaued effort by the Institute for Research on Poverty at the same level as over the past fourteen years, since. vs indicated earlier, this grant is proposed to replace the core grant of the Institute The prospectus should follow from ILe historical analvsis section. It mw. of course, also discuss research a-ras and issues that were not mentioned in that analysis if the author or authors of the application feel there have bnn gaps in past research, or that new factors have or soon will begin to affect incume distribution, mobility patterns, and the incidence of poverty. The prospectus may discus% research issues from a government program or sochl prblem perspective as long as these perspectiv es are clearly connected in the application to the announcenwnt's central concern with ecunanrnc inequality While this prospectus %ill not include the kind of detailed descripions of individual research projects that will be expected m the Center's annual research plans, it should be specific about long- term research themes, The lines of research described in the prospectus should be concrete enough that priject descrptions in subsequent arnnal research plans can be viewed as articulating a researmn theme discussed in the prospectus. An applicaLon that simply contains an adhcn categorization of an unstructurEd set of research projects will be jud,ed unacceptable. (c) A staffing and organizational proposal for the Po% erty Restakn Center, including an anri sis of the types of background needed among staff members, the Center s orgarzatsonal structure, 0nd linkiges ,.wih the host universi- and othEr orgar.rzAiuns. It is in this third sf-chon inO4 Me should ch, and the tntinuit of tie preien? puvertyresearch program. Full resumes of proposed staffmembers should be included as a separate appendix to the apolication. The time commitment t. Center for each proposed staff member shuuld be indicated. The kinds of administrative and tenure arranr;ments the Center proposes to make sbn.h also be discussed in tbs section. In a! Ltion, the author(s) of the apne:catfon and the role wIch he or she (they) will pe.v in the pr:,pocd Poverty Research Canter must be specified. (d) A swum=rv of pest work at the university and at the exastfng mstilutlon proposed as the location of the new Poverty Research Center that relates directly or indirectly to the natura, causes, and effects of changes in the distribution of income, mobility patterns, and the incidence of pvertv. Where specifc indiv duals are proposed for the staff of the Center, it is legitimate to dismiss their past research. whether or not it took place in either the institution proposed to be the lo:,tion of the new Poverty Research Center or the host university.

On October 30,1979, pursuant to the provisions of the Alaska Business Corporation Act, the Native village of Anvik (Central Native Corporation) amended its Articles of Incorporation changing the corporate name to Ingalik, Incorporated. Ingalik, Incorporated, n its application, excluded unnamed lake in Secs. 13 and 14, T. 28 N., R. 60 W.. Seward Meridian. Because this body of water has been determined to be nonnavigable, it is considered to be public lands withdrawn under Sec. 11(a)(1) and available for selection bythe village pursuant to Sec. 12(a) of ANCSA. Section 12(a) and 43 CFR 2651.4(b) and (c) provide that the village corporation shall select all available lands within the township or townships within which the village is located, and that additional lands selected shall be compact and in whole sections. The regulations also provide that the area selected will not be considered to be reasonably compact ff it excludes other lands available for selection within its exterior boundaries. For these reasons, the water body which was improperly excluded in the application of Ingalik, Incorporated, is considered selected.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORATION In addition to the description and analysis of the proposed action, the FEIS analyzes five alternatives and identifies the agency preferred alternative, which includes portions of the proposal and alternatives. The FEIS also includes testimonj from five public hearings on the DEIS, 130 letters of comment, and appropriate responses. As described in the FEIS, the applicants' proposed action is to construct and operate a 500-MW powerplant and a 55.000-acre-foot reservoir in Warner Valley. Utah, and a 2,000-MW powerplant at Dry Lake, Nevada, with coal slurried to the plants from the Alton coal field in southern Utah. Analyzed alternatives to the proposed action include. (1) construct a 2,000-MW powerplant at Dry Lake, Nevada, with coal slurried from the Alton coal field; (2) construct a 2,0--MW powerplant and a 55,000-acre-foot reservoir at Warner Valley, Utah, with coal trucked from the Alton coal field and a 1,000-MW powerplant at Dry Lake, Nevada, with coal railed from central Utah or southwestern Wyoming: (3) construct a 2,000-MW powerplant at Dry Lake, Nevada, with coal railed from central Utah or southwestern Wyoming: (4) energy conservation and the development of alternative energy sources; and (5) no action. In developing and analyzing the alternative for energy conservation and alternative sources, the California Public Utilities Commission developed and provided data which presented the projected energy needs and energy conservation results for California, a major recipient of the proposed energy production and transmission. The agency preferred alternative in the FEIS is the development of the Harry Allen powerplant at Dry Lake, Nevadaand associated transmission lines, at a capacity to meet State and Federal regulatory requirements, in combination with energy conservation and alternative energy resources. Under this alternative, action would be deferred on the Alton coal field and associated coal slurry pipelines until the Utah State Engineer decides on the proponents' water rights applications and the Secretary of the Interior has rendered a decision on the unsuitability petition for the Alton coal field. This alternative does not include development of the proposed powerplant at Warier Valley, Utah: associated transmission lines and proposed coal slurry pipeline; or the proposed Warner Valley reservior, as currently designed, A limited number of copies of the FEIS are available at the Cedar City District Office, Bureau of Land Management, 15,79 North Main Street, Cedar City.

These rules provide, among other things, that a petition for intervention, either in support of or in opposition to the granting of an application, must be filed with the Commission within 30 days after the date notice of the application is published in the Federal Register. Protests (such as were allowed to filings prior to March 1, 1979) will be rejected. A petition for intervention without leave must comply with Rule 247(k) which requires petitioner to demonstrate that it (1) holds operating authority-permitting performance of any of the service which the applicant seeks authority to perform, (2) has the necessary equipment andfacilities for performing that service, and (3) has performed service within the scope of the application either (a) for those supporting the application, or, (b) where the service is not limited to the facilities of particular shippers, from and to, or between, any of the involved points. Persons unable to intervene under Rule 247(k) may file a petition for leave to intervene under Rule 247(1) setting forth the specific grounds upon which it is made, including a detailed statement of petitioner's interest, the particular facts, matters, and things relied upon, including the extent, if any, to which petitioner (a) has solicited the traffic or business of those supporting the application, or, (b) where the identity of those supporting the application is not included in the published application notice, has solicited traffic or business identical to any part of that sought by applicant within the affected marketplace. The Commission will also consider (a) the nature and extent of the property, financial, or other interest of the petitioner, (b) the effect of the decision which may be rendered upon petitioner's interest, (c) the availability of other means by which the petitioner's interest might be protected, (d) the extent to which petitioner's interest will be represented by other parties, (e) the extent to which petitioner's participation may reasonably be expected to assist in the development of a sound record, and (fJ the extent to which participation by the petitioner would broaden the issues or delay the proceeding. Petitions not in reasonable compliance with the requirements of the rule may be rejected. An original and one copy of the petition to intervene shall be filed with the Commission indicating the specific rule under which the petition to intervene is being filed, and a copy shall be served concurrently upon applicant's representative, or upon applicant if no representative is named. Section 247(f) provides, in part, that an applicant which does not intend to timely prosecute its application shall promptly request that it be dismissed, and that failure to prosecute an application under the procedures of the Commission will result in its dismissal. If an applicant has introduced rates as an issue it is noted. Upon request, an applicant must provide a copy of the tentative rate schedule to any protestant. Further processing steps will be by Commission notice, decision, or letter which will be served on each party of record. Broadening amendments will not be accepted ofter November 21, 19&0. Any authority granted may reflect administrative acceptable restrictiveamendments to the service proposed below. Some of the applications may have been modified to conform to the Commission's policy of simpliflying grants of operating authority. Findings: With the exceptioniof those applications involving duly noted problems (e.gs., unresolved common control, unresolved fitness questions, and jurisdictional problems] we find. preliminarily, that each common carrier applicant has demonstrated that its proposed service is required by the present and future public convenience and necessity, and that each contract carrier applicant qualifies as a contract carrier and its proposed contract carrier service will be consistent with the public interest and the transportation policy of 49 U.S.C. 10101. Each applicant is fit, willing, and able properly to perform the service proposed and to conform to the requirements of Title 49, Subtitle IV. United States Code, and the Commission's regulation. Except where specifically noted this decision is neither a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment nor a major regulatory action under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975. In those proceedings containing a statement or note that dual operations are or may be involved we find, preliminarily and in the absence of the issue being raised by a petitioner, that the proposed dual operations are consistent ,with the public interest and the transportation policy of 49 U.S.C. 10101 subject to the right of the Commission, which is expressly reserved, to impose such terms, conditions of limitations as it finds necessary to insure that applicant's operations shall conform to the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 10930(a) (formerly section 210 of thenterstate Commerce Act.) In the absence of legally sufficient petitions for intervention, filed on or before December 22,1980 (or, if the application later becomes unopposed), appropriate authority will be issued to each applicant (except those with duly noted problems) upon compliance with certain requirements which will be set forth in a notification of effectiveness of the decision-notice.

The following applications, filed on or after April 1, 1979, are governed by the special procedures set forth in Part 1062.2 of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations (49 CFR 1062.2). The rules provide, in part, that carriers may file petitions with this Commission for the purpose of seeking intervention in these proceedings. Such petitions may seek intervention either with or without leave as discussed below. However, all such petitions must be filed in the form of verified statements, and contain all of the information offered by the submitting party in opposition. Petitions must be filed with the Commission on or before December 22, 1980. Petitions for intervention without leave (i.e.) automatic intervention) may be filed only by carriers which are, or have been, participating in the joint-line service sought to be replaced by applicant's single-line proposal, and then only if such participation has occurred within the one-year period immediately preceding the application's filing. Only carriers which fall .within this filing category can base their opposition upon the issue of the public need for the proposed service. Petitions for intervention with leave may be filed by any carrier. The nature of the opposition, however, must be limited to issues other than the public77182 Federal Register I Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 190 / Notices need for the proposed service. The appropriate basis for opposition, i.e., applicant's fitness, may include challenges concerning the veracity of the applicant's supporting information, and the bona fides of the joint-line service sought to be replaced (including the issue of its substantiality).

Find ns.\" With the exception of those applications involving duly noted problems (e.gs., unresolved common control, unresolved fitness questions, and jurisdictional problems) we find, preliminarW, that each applicant has demonstrated that its proposed service is required by the present and future / public convenience and necessity. Each applicant is fit, willing, and able properly to perform the service proposed and to conform to the requirements of Title 49, Subtitle IV, United States Code, and the Commission's regulations.

[FR Wolfeboro Railroad Associates- Petition for Exemption From Filing an Application To Acquire and Operate a RailroadUne and From Filing an Application To Issue Securities AGENCY: Interstate Commerce Commission. ACTION: Notice of proposed exemption. SUMMARY: In Docket No. AB-208F, Wolfeboro Rail Road Co., Inc.-Entire Line Abandonment Near Sanbornville At Wolfeboro, in Carroll County, NH (not printed), decided September 24, 1979, the Commission issued a certificate and decision authorizing abandonment of the entire 12-mile line. In November, 1979, a limited partnership, Wolfeboro Railroad Associates (Associates) purchased the stock of Wolfeboro Rail Road Co., Inc. (Wolfeboro) intending to reinstitute the tourist and freight services which Wolfeboro had previously provided. On July 3, 1980, Associates filed a petition for exemption from: (1) 49 U.S.C. 10901, which requires prior Commission approval for the acquisition and operation of the railroad line; and (2) 49 U.S.C. 11301, which requires Commission approval of all issuances of securities and assumptions of obligations by railroads. DATES: Comments must be received on or before December 22,1980. ADDRESS: Send an original and 12 copies of all comments to: Section of Finance, Room 5414, Interstate Commerce Commission, 12th St. and Constitution Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20423. All written statements will be available for public inspection during regular business hours at the same address. Comments should refer to Finance Docket No. 29409. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ellen Hanson,-(202) 275-7245. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: By petition filed July 3, 1980, Associates requests exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505: (1) From the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 10901, with respect to acquisition and operation of railroads; and (2) from 49 U.S.C. 11301, with respect to issuingsecurities and assumption of liabilities by railroads. In 1973, Wolfeboro acquired the 12- mile line between Wolfeboro and Sanbornville, NH, intending to attract primarily tourist patronage. The attempt failed and the Commission authorized abandonment of the entire line In Docket No. AB-208F. Wolfeboro Rail Road Co., In--Entire Line Abandonment Near Sanbornville at Wolfeboro, In Carroll County, NH (not printed), decided September 24.1979. No steps have been taken to effect abandonment. In November 1979, Associates purchased all of the stock of Wolfeboro, acquired certain related lands, assumed certain liabilities, and subsequently leased all of the railroad's real estate and operating equipment in order to resume operations. Associates is a limited partnership with two general partners (WMC, Inc. and Wolfeboro Railroad Management Corp.) and 20 individual limited partners. Associates believes that the limited partnership form of association enhances its ability to build the railroad into a profitable operation. It further believes that the timetable and cost of filing applications under if 10X1 and 11301 to accomplish the change in legal form (from the existing corporation to a limited partnership) are too long and too burdensome for it to bear as a small business attempting to get started. Associates maintains that the circumstances surrounding its activities meet the criteria for exemption under \u00a7 10505. It argues that the two matters sought to be exempted are very limited in scope. No public offering is involved and the shares will be sold only to 2 general and 20 limited partners for a total consideration of $660,000. The railroad itself is only 12 miles long and has only one connection, with the 'Boston & Maine Corporation at Sanbornville. The nature and volume of service to be provided is allegedly such that it will have little, if any, impact on national transportation. The public interest in this proceeding, according to Associates, will extend no further than the local communities (which hoipe to benefit from tourism) and two local businesses (which hope to use the railroad for freight service). The public, according to petitioner, would actually benefit from speedy Commission action through granting the exemptions. These circumstances present a situation of limited impact which appears to be appropriate for exemption from Commission regulation. Operationally, the area served and services provided by petitioners are quite limited. The legal ramifications ofthe proposal are also relatively minor because Associates essentially proposes to step into Wolfeboro's shoes. The oly real change is to the limited partnership form of doing business. We can exempt a matter related to a rail carrier under 49 U.S.C. 10505 if it: (1) Is of limited scope; (2) is not necessary to carry out the transportation policy of 49 U.S.C. 10101: (3) would be an unreasonable burden; and (4) would serve little or no useful public purpose. Before considering an exemption we are required to provide the opportunity for a proceeding. This request for comments on the proposed exemptions of the involved transaction is that opportunity. All comments filed, along with petitioner's application, will be used to determine whether either of the exemptiona should be granted, in whole or in part. All persons filing comments in this proceeding are required to serve one copy on petitioner's representatives: John Cunningham, Michael Joseph. Kominers, Fort. Schlefer & Boyer, 1776 F Street NW., Washington, DC 20006. This proceeding is instituted under the authority of 49 U.S.C. 10505 and pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 and 559. This proceeding is not a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment or energy consumption. Dated November 61980. By the Commission. Chairman Gaskins.

The petition is filed under section 101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. A summary of the petitioner's statements follows: 1. The petition concerns the installation of lighting fixtures on the mine's roof bolting machines: 2. Petitioner states that installation of lighting fixtures on the mine's roof bolting machines would result in a diminution of safety to the miners affected because the lights: a. Cause eye strain for the miners as they travel from dark to lighted areas of the mine; b. Limit the vision of the machine operator past the glow of the lights; and c. Reduce the effectiveness of the miners' cap lamps. 3. For these reasons, the petitioner requests a modification of the standard.

CODE 45t0.-26-M Office of the Secretary LTA-W-90511] Bethlehem Steel Carp;, Sparrows Point, Maryland Determinations Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2273) the Department of Labor herein presents the results of on investigation regarding certificatiorr of eligibility: to apply for worker adjustment assistance., In order to make an affirmative determination and issue a certification of eligibility to apply for adjustment assistance, each of thegroup eligibility requirements of Section 222 of the Act mut be-met. (1) That a significant number or proportion of the workers in the workers' firm, or an appropriate subdivision thereof, have become totally or partially separated, or are threatened to become totally or partially separated. (2).That sales or production, or both, of the firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely. (3) That increases of imports of articfes like or directly competitive with articles produced-by the firm or appropriate subdivision have contributed importantly to the separations, or threat thereof, and to the absolute decline in sales or production, The investigation was initiated on Tune 30,'1980 In response to a petition received or June 1T. 1980 which was filed by the United Steelworkers of America om behalf of workers and formerworkers. at Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Sparrows Point, Maryland.:--= I I III I III I77:198 Vesal Reis~er / Vol. 46, No. 127 / Friday, November 21, 100 / Notices Wykers at tie-Sparrows Point plant produceteelndsteel products.

A Departmet of Labor survey revealed that some of Sparrow Points's customer increased their purchases of imported cold rolled sheet in 1979 compared to 1978 or in the first eight months of I0 compared to the same period in AM A Department of Labor survey revealed that none of Sparrow Points's customers increase their purchases of imported avanized sheet in 1979 compared to 1978 or in tere first eight months of 1980 compared to the same period in 1979. A Department of Labor survey revealed that Sparrow Point's customers reduced their overall demand for rods from both domestic and foreign sources in 1979 compared to 1978 and in the first eight months oH980 compared to the same period in 1879. Most of the surveyed customers did not purchase imported rods. In 1979 compared to 1978, none of the surveyed costomers reduced purchases from the Sparrows Point plant while increasingpmrchases of imported rods. In thf-first eight months of 180 compared-to the same period in 199, the customers-that increased-purchases of imported rods did so by an amount that accounted for an insignificant portion of Sparrow Points's rod sales decline over those periods. With-iespect to the production of pipe, all the criteria have been met U.S. imnports of carbon steel pipe and tube increased both absolutely and relative to domestic shipments in the first half of 1930 compared to the first half of 190. A Department of Labor survey revealed that some customers reduced purchases of pipe from the Sparrows Point plant and increased purchases of imported pipe in the first eight months of 1980 compared to the same period in 1979. The Department is in the process of obtaining additional information on Sparrow Point's production and sales of hot rolled sheet, wire and wire products and tin plate products. The findings for these products and for basic steelmaking at Sparrows Point will be issued in a separate determination.Conclusion After careful rview of the facts obtained in the investigation. I conclude that increases of imports of articles like or directly competitive with the pipe produced at the Sparrows Point, Maryland plant of Bethlehem Steel Corporation contributed importantly to the decline in sales or production and to the total or partial separation of workers of that plant. In accordance with the provisions of the Act, I make the following certification: \"All workers or Bethlehem Steel Corporation. Sparrows Point.

This determination was published in the Federal-Register on August 8. 1980. (45 FR 5206). The union claimed in its application for reconsideration that the Department placed excessive reliance on its customer survey and-made no mention in its denial of increased U.S. imports of passenger car and truck tires in 1979. The union further claimed that other workers at other URW-represented plants including workers at a Firestone plant in Salinas, California were certified for trade adjustment assistance within the last two years. The Department's review of the investigative file showed that passenger car tire and truck tire workers at the Decatur, Illinois plant did not meet the\"contributed importantly\" test of the Trade Act of 1974. The review also showed that truck tire production at Decatur increased, in quantity, in 1979 compared to 1978 and in the first two months of 1960 compared to the same period in 197. The Department's survey of Firestone's passenger car tire customers showed that the respondents'reliance on imports of passenger car tires was not significant and was substantially below the industry-wide levels of imports in 1978 and 1979. The Department's survey of Firestone's trck tire customers showed that they either did not import or decreased their imports of truck tires in 1979 compared to 1978 and in the first four months of 1980 compared to the same period in 1979. Customers who decreased purchases of truck tires from Firestone and increased imports represented an insignificant proportion of Firestone's truck tire sales and an insignificant proportion of Firestone's decline in sales in 1979 compared to 1978 and in the first four months of 1980 compared to the same period in 1979. In order for a worker group to become certified it must meet all three statutory criteria under Section 222 of the Trade Act including the \"contributed importantly\" test. The\"contributed importantly\" test is determined through a survey of the firm's customers. Truck tire workers at Decatur did not meet the decreased production or sales criterion nor the\"contributed importantly\" test while passenger car tire workers did not meet the \"contributed importantly\" test. Increased imports of passenger car and truck tires by themselves are not enough for the Department to grant certification. The Department does not agree with the claim that its investigation of the Decatur worker group was conducted differently from other adjustment assistance investigations by'the Department The Department's certifications of Salinas and South Gate were based on three elements: the trend in company imports; the trend in aggregate imports; and the results of the survey of the plants' customers. On all three points the data indicated contrary results in the Decatur case. The Department notes that the certifications for the Salinas and South Gate worker groups were based on data available at the time of the investigation. The petition dates for the Salinas and South Gate worker groups are November 16,1979 and August 21, 1979, respectively, while the peztion date for the Decatur worker group is March 5,1980. Company import data for passenger car tires in the Salinas and South Gate cases ran to November 1979 and July 1979, respectively; however the downward trend in company imports which began in the third quarter of 1979 was not yet ovvious at the time of these investigations. In the Decatur investigation the Department had company import data on passenger car tires through March 1980, which showed77199 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices clearly a significant decrease in company import activity. U.S. aggregate import data at the time of the Salinas and South Gate investigations ranonly through September and June 1979, respectively. These data showed that U.S..imports of passenger car tires increased both absolutely and relative to domestic production in the first six months and the first nine months of 1979 compared to the respective periods in 1978. However, U.S. aggregate ireport data for passenger car tires at the time of the Decatur investigation was showing an absolute decrease in the first six months of 1980 compared to the same period in 1979. Further, the downward trend in company imports of passenger car tires beginning in the second half of 1979 runs in tandem with the decline in U.S. aggregate imports of passenger car tires for that period and the first six months of 1980. In its reconsideration, the Department updated its earlier Firestone surveys and conducted another large random survey of Firestone's customers. The 'Department's updated survey showed that the import reliance in passenger car tires in the first six months of 1980 was not significant. The random survey showed that import reliance in the first six months of 1980 Was below that for the same period in 1979. The few responding customers with declining purchases from Firestone and increasing imports represented less than one-half of one percent of Firestone's total sales decline in 1979 and 1980. Although a two-part survey on Firestone's customers was conducted in the Salinas investigation, one including national accounts and the other-local Western accounts the Department did not see fit to do this for the Decatur plant since it is the Department's understanding that Decatur's output is marketed nationally.

This determination was published in the Federal Register on July 11, 1980, (45 FR 46932). *The union claimed in its application for reconsideration that the - Department's investigation was not - consistent with others conducted by the Department and that their private brand tire customers were not included in the Department's survey. The union did not seek reconsideration with respect to' tractor-tire workers at Des Moines. The Department's review of the investigative file showed that passenger car tire workers at the Des Moines, Iowa plant did not meet the \"contributed importantly\" test of the Trade Act of 1974. Only workers producing earthmover tires at Des Moines met all the statutory criteria for certification. The Department's survey of Firestone's passenger car tire customers showed that the respondent's reliance on imports of passenger car tires was not significant and was substantially below the industry-wide levels of imports in 1978 and 1979. The Department does not agree with the claim that its investigation of the Des Moines worker group is inconsistent with others, especially the Salinas and South Gate, California investigations conducted by the Department. The Department's certifications of Salinas and South Gate were based on three elements: the trend in company imports; the trend in aggregate imports; and the results of the survey of the plants' customers. On all three points the data indicated contrary results in the Des Moines case. The Department notes that the certificallons for the Salinas and South Gate worker groups were based on data available at the time of the investigation. The petition dates for the Salinas and South Gate worker groups are November 16,1979 and August 21; 1979, respectively, while the petition date for the'Des Moines worker group is March 3, 1980. Company import data for passenger car tires in the Salinas.and South Gate cases ran to November 1979 and July 1979, respectively; however the downward trend in company imports which began in the third quarter of 1979was not yet obvious at the time of these investigations. In the Des Moines investigation the Department had company import data on passenger car tires through March 1980, which showed clearly a significant decrease in company import activity. U.S. aggregate import data at the time of the Salinas and South Gate investigations ran only through September and June 1979, respectively. These data showed that U,S. imports of passenger car tires increased both absolutely and relative to domestic production in the first six months and the first nine months of 1979 compared to the respective periods in 1978, However, U.S. aggregate Import data for passenger car tires at the time of the Des Moines investigation was showing an absolute decrease in the first six months of 1980 compared to the same period in 1979.

Further, the Department found on reconsideration that a substantial amount of the production at Des Moines in 1979 was private brands; however, only a negligible amount consisted of Seiberling or Zenith tires-the primary house brands at the Barberton, Ohio facility of a Firestone subsidiary. The Department found that of the 20 private brands listed in the application, nine were included in the Department's survey among which were several of Firestone's largest private label customers.__ I ,i I77200 Federal Register / Vol. 45.

Vergne, Tenn.; Negative Deternination on Reconsideration On September 22 1980, the Department made an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application., for Reconsideration for workers and former workers producing truck tires at the La Vergne, Tennessee plant of the Firestone ITe andRubber Company. This deenninatien was published in the Federalf ister on September 30, IN0% (46 FRO8476). The union claimed in its application for reconsideration that the Department s iestigation was not consistent with othes conducted by the Departmentespecially the Firestone investigations concerning the Salinas, and South Gate, California plants. The union also claimed that their private brand truck tire customers were not included in the Department's survey. The Departneant's review of the investgativefle showed that the truck tire wonlem at the La Vergne, Tennessee plant did not meet the\"contributed importantly\" test of the Trade Act of I8'. 7%e Department surveyed major customers and a random sample of the smaller customers of Firestone who purchased truck ires. Most custonm from both groups indicated that they either did not import or decreased their imports of truck tires. Customers who decreased purchases of truck tires from Firestone and increased their import purchases represented an insignificant proportion of truck tire sales for Firestone and an insignificant proportion of Firestone's decline in sales in 1979 compared with 1W78 and in the first four months of 130 compared with the jame period in 17. The Department does not agree with the claim that its investigation of the La Vergne plant is inconsistent with others conducted by the Department, especiallythe Salinas and South Gtc Ca hforria investigations The Depdrtment notes that it conducted its investigation of the Salinas and South Gate piants i an earlier time frame, based on their earher petitions The Department's certification of Salinas and South Gait were based on three elements; the trend in compary imports; the trend ir aggregate imports; and the results of the survey of the plants' customers, On all three points the data indicated contrary results in the La Vergne case. First, with respect to company imports, Firestone's imports of truck tires in 1960 were negligible when compared to La Vergne's production of truck tires in 190. Secondly, at the time of the Salinas and South Gate investi tions, the Department had U.S. aggregate import data through September and June of 1979. respectively. These data showed that U.S. imports of truck tires increased both absolutely and relative to domestic production in the rt six and nine months of i compared to their respective periods in 1978. However, at the time of the La Vergue Investigation. U.S. aggregate import data for tnic tires was daclining. U.S. imports of truck tires decreased absolutely in the first six months of 1960 compared to the same period in 1=. Layoffs at La Vergne began in March 1980. Further, the Department found on reconsideration that only a minor amount of the huck tire production at La Vergne in 17 and 1980 was private brands and that many of these private brand were included in the Department's survey among which were several of Firestone's largest private label customrs. In its reconsideration the Department had available a new survey of Firestone's truck tire cuetomem. Through the first six months of 1980, this survey was consistent with the earlier truck tire customer survey.

The 'determination was published in the Federal Register on September 19, 1980, (45 FR 62589). Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c), reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances: (1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous; (2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts previously considered; or (3) If, in the-opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justifies reconsideration of the decision. The union claims that even though imports of receiving tubes have decreased, the potential for worker separations has increased. The union also claims that their workers should have been certified since millions of receiving tubes, tube mounts and T.V. sets are being imported. The Department's review showed that the petition for workers p roducing receiving tubqs at General Electric Tube Products' plant in Owensboro, Kentucky did not meet the increased import criterion in 1979'and the first half of1980. U.S. imports of electronic receiving tubes decreased both absolutely and' relative to domestic shipments in 1979 compared to 1978 and in the first half of 1980 comparedto the same period in 1979. Company imports of the tube mounts decreased in 1979 compared to 1978 and in the first five months of 1980 compared, to the same period in 1979. The domestic receiving tube industry faces a receding market because of the advances of solid state technology. The displacement of tubes in new T.V. equipment has caused a decline in original equipment tube sales to nearly zero. Additionally, the quality and popularity of solid state television has been a factor in the decline in replacement sales of receiving tubes in recent years. The Department does not consider that the union's claim that the potential for worker s~pardtions at the Owensboro plant has increased provides a basis for certification under the Trade Act of 1974. Actual layoffs at Owensboro were attributed to the declining domestic market for electronic receiving tubes. The Department does not agree for the following reasons with the union's claim that the Owensboro workers should have been certified since T.V. sets, receiving tubes, and tube mounts are being imported. Firstly, imported T.V. sets incorporating receiving tubes cannot be considered as imported receiving tubes. The Department has% previously determined that a finished article is not like or directly competitive with its component parts. This position is supported by the courts. Secondly, one of the criteria for group certification under the Trade Act is that imports of products directly competitive with the product produced at the workers' firm or appropriate subdivision must have increased.-This is not the case with the workers at Owensboro since imports of receiving tubes decreased in the period under investigation. Thirdly, the mounts produced at Owensboro are only used for Owensboro tube production. Company imports of mounts were found to be decreasing,_ Conclusion After review of the application and the investigative file, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation of fact or misinterpretation of the law which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is; therefore, denied.Signed at Washington, D.C., this 13th day of November 1980. James F. Taylor, Director, Office of Management, Adiministration and Planning.

[FR Doc 8(- led 11-&)-40: 15 a1 ] BILLING CODE 703.I-M NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION [NUREG-06191 BWR Feedwater Nozzle and Control Rod Drive Return Line Nozzle Cracking; Report Issuance and Availability A task group with members from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff has prepared a report entitled \"BWR Feedwater Nozzle and Control Rod Drive Return Line Nozzle Cracking\" (NUREG-0619), dated October, 1980. The report provides the staffs resolution of the NRC's Generic Technical Activity A-10, which was an \"Unresolved Safety Issue\" pursuant to Section 210 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974. The generic study resulted from the inservice discovery of cracking in feedwater nozzles and control rod drive return line nozzles. NUREG-0619 describes the technical issues, the technical studies and analyses performed by the General Electric Company and the NRC staff, the staffs technical positions based on these studies, and the staffs plans for requiring licensee and applicant continued implementation of its technical postions. The NRC staff has concluded, in the case of the feedwater nozzles, that the combination of nozzle clad removal, installation of General Electric.designed triple sleeve spargers (or others with satisfactory characteristics), procedural changes, and systems changes where deemed necessary, will assure the goal of long term operation without significant crack growth. However, nooperatirg reactor currently satisfies all requirements, and plant specific implementation will be necessary. The staff has established inservice inspection intervals based upon its evaluation of the combined proposed solutions. With regard to the control rod drive return line nozzle, the staff has concluded that certain control rod drive hydraulic system modifications will be necessary on all operating reactors. The staff's principal considerations were the need to prevent cracking of the nozzle and the need to assure high pressure control rod drive system flow to the reactor vessel sufficient to cover the core when other other sources of water are unavailable. This was the case at some times during the fire at Brown's Ferry Unit No. 1. The staff report requires that each operating plant prove this capability, which may require the simultaneous operation of the two control rod drive pumps, and also requires that plants currently under licensing review conform to the criteria developed for operating reactors for both the feedwater nozzle and control rod drive return line nozzle issues. This requirement plus others contained in Part II of NUREG-69, represents a conservative departure from current licensing criteria. Public comments on the report, including the proposed new requirements and implemenation schedules, were solicited from Interested organizations, groups and individuals. The staff has evaluated the comments received and has incorporated the applicable comments in this revision of NUREG-0619.

Anthony Bournia, Acting Chief Licensing Branch No, 1, Division of Licensing. 50-3200LA1 Metropolitan Edison Company, et al., (Three Mile Island Nuclear Station, Unit 2); Amendment of Order I Metropolitan Edison Company, Jersey Central Power and Light Company and Pennsylvania Electric Company (collectively, the Licensee) are the holders of Facility Operating License No. DPR-73, which had authorized operation of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Station, Unit 2 (TMI-2 at powerlevels up to 2772 megawatts thermal. The facility, which is located in Londonderry Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, is a pressured water reactor previously used for the commercial generation of electricity. By Order for Modification of License, dated July 20, 1979, the Licensee's authority to operate the facility was suspended and the Licensee's authority was limited to maintenance of the facility in the present shutdown cooling mode (44 FR 45271). By further Order of the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, dated February 11, 190, a new set of formal license requirements was imposed to reflect the post-accident condition of the facility and to assure the continued maintenance of the current safe, stable, long-term cooling condition of the facility (45 FR 11282). These requirements, in the form of proposed Technical Specifications, would modify the facility operating license so as to: (1) define operating parameters for the current safe, stable, long-term cooling mode for the facility (defined as the reco% cry mode), and delete all other permissible operating modes so as to assure that operation of the facility in other than the stable shutdown condition of the recovery mode is precluded. (2) impose functional, operability. redundancy and surveillance requirements as well as safety limits and limiting conditions with regard to those structures, s)stems. equipment and components necessary to maintain the facility in the current safe, stable shutdown condition and to cope with foreseeable off-normal conditions, (3) prohibit venting or purging or other treatment of Ithe approximately 57,000 curies of krypton-85 in] the reactor bulding atmosphere, the disLharge of water decontaminated by EPICOR-1l system, and the treatment and disposal of high-level radioactively contaminated water in the reactor building, until each of these activities has been approved by the NRC,1 consistent with the Commission's Statement of Policy and Notice of Intent to Prepare a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (44 FR 67738]. On the basis of the public health, safety, and interest, the requirements of the proposed Technical Specifications, attached to the February 11, 1980 Order, were made effective immediately. Under the terms of the Order, since requests for a hearing are pending before an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, the proposed formal license amendment incorporating these proposed Technical IBy Memorandum and Order, dated June 12. Ic9d, the Commission gave the approval contemplated by this restriction insofar as necessary for the Lcensee to conduct a puqin of the TMt-2 containment in accordance with procedures approved by the NRC. CLI-aO-2S. Th activity was completed on July 1, 1960.Specifications will become effective, in the event a hearing is granted, on the date specified in an order made following the hearing or, upon other final dispositiion of such proceeding. It Following the March 28,1979 accident at TMNII-Z it became necessary in late April 1979 to alter the preferred cooling mode for the reactor by a transition from use of forced circulation by the reactor coolant system pumps to natural convection circulation. By letters dated July 31, 1980 (Reference 1) and August 5,1980 (Reference 2), the Metropolitan Edison Company (licensee) proposed changes to the Recoverv Mode technical specifications for Three Mile Island Unit 2 (TMI-2) providing for the implementation of the Mini Decay Heat Removal System [MDHRS) for long-term core cooling. Although several modes for removing decay heat would be available, the MDHRS would provide a forced flow system for removing decay heat from the TMI-2 reactor fuel. Accordingly, the proposed changes would impose operability requirements for the MDHRS and would also delete the operability requirements for certain Balance of Plant (BOP) systems which have been used since the March 28, 1979, accident, but would no longer be required, for removing the decay heat The operability requirements for these BOP systems had been imposed by the Order of the Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation on February 11, 1980, (45 FR 11282) in the form of proposed Technical Specifications. The proposed change would make available a newly installed MDHRS to remove decay heat rather than the present method which accomplishes this function by using the \"A\" steam generator in a steaming mode to the condenser. The licensee's proposal required certain modifications to meet our requirements. With the incorporation of these staff required modifications, we have found the proposal to be an acceptable method for removing the decay heat and have therefore granted the licensee's request to modify the method used for long term core cooling. The TMI-2 Reactor Coolant System (RCS) is currently operating in a natural circulation heat removal mode with heat rejection from it being accomplished by both loss to ambient (reactor atmosphere and sump water) and through the \"A\" steam generator. The reactor building is in turn being cooled by the reactor building fan coolers while the \"A\" steam generator is steaming to the condenser through the turbine77205 Federal Register / Vol. 45, %No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices bypass valve, This mode of core cooling has been in effect since late April 1979. With passage of time and, the associated reduction of deday heat generation rate (presently approximately 75 kw), the natural circulation flow has changed from continuous to cyclic with increasing intervals between the cyclic flow \"burps\". Heat rejection through the \"A\" steam generator by steaming to the condenser requires the operation of several major BOP systems including: circulating water system, main steam system and the \"A\" steam generator, condensate and feedwater systems, main condenser and package boiler. Conversion to and use of the MDHRS for core cooling would simplify the plant operations since use of the MDHRS would eliminate the need for operating the previously noted BOP systems. The MDHRS is classified as a nonsafety grade system but it is designed and installed to seismic Category I requirements up to and including the second isolation valve in its supply and discharge lines. The balance of the system is designed and installed to Operating Basis Earthquake requirements. The MDHRS takes suction from the \"B\" loop of the Decay Heat System (DH) outlet from the reactor vessel via a connection to the Alternate Decay Heat Removal System (ADM). After passing through one of the MDHR's parallel heat exchangers and pumps, the reactor coolant is returned to the reactor coolant system through the \"B\" Core Flooding injection nozzle via a connection to the ADH and DH systems. Connection of the ADH to the DH was evaluated and approved in NUREG- 0557. The MDFIRS is sized such that one pump and one heat exchanger (two of each are installed) could remove up to approximately 1 MW of decay heat. Therefore the MDHRS has more than adequate cooling capacity forremoving the present and future decay heat loads. The MDHRS would be cooled by the Nuclear Services Closed Cycle Cooling System which is required to be operable by proposed Technical Specification 3.7.3.1. The power supply for the MDHRS pumps and motor operated valves is from redundant Class 1E busses which would be manually loaded on the Class 1E diesel generators in the event of a loss of off-site power. In the event the MDHRS is not used or becomes inoperable, backup cooling modes are available for removing the decay heat from the RCS. These backup cooling modes include the long term \"B\" steam generator cooling system and \"Loss to Ambient.\" The long term \"B\" steam generator cooling system hasbeen previously evaluated and its operability would continue to be required by proposed Technical Specification 3,7.1. The NRC staff has reviewed the licenrFee's results of the \"Loss to Ambient\" cooling mode and has performed an independent analysis, the results of which are in agreement with the licensee's conclusion. Therefore, we have concluded that any one of these cooling methods provides an acceptable means for long tern cooling of the reactor core. The staffs overall evaluation of the MDHRS is presented in the concurrently issued Safety Evaluation Report (SER). The MDHRS has a design pressure of 235 psig. Therefore, consideration was given to possible sources of overpressurization of the MDHRS. Three potential sources of MDHRS overpressurization were identified. These sources were: (1) Makeup pump operation with MDHRS in operation, (2) Pressurizer heater operation and (3) 'Malfunction of the Standby Pressure Control (SPC) System. To preclude operation of a makeup pump during operation of the MDHRS, the licensee proposed to delete the requirement for an operable makeup pump from the proposed Technical Specifications but to retain the option to operate the pump for certain operations (e.g., degassing). The licensee further stated that the electrical power supply circuit breakers for the makeup pumps would be \"racked out\" when valve DH- V1 orDH.V171 is open. Since operation of a makeup pump may be required in one or more of the backup cooling modes or for degasssing operations, we will retain a requirement for its operability in proposed Technical Specification 3.1.1.1. However, to provide assurance that the MDHRS will not be overpressurized due to operation. of a makeup pump, we propose to add a requirement to proposed Techncial Specifications 3.1.1.1 that all makeup pumps be made inoperable when valve DH-V1 or DH-V171 is open by 'racking out\". their electrical power supply circuit breakers. We would also add a surveillance requirement to the Recovery Operations Plan to periodically verify that these breakers are \"racked out.\" These actions provide assurance that the MDHRS would not be overpressurized due tooperation of the makeup pumps. Operation of the pressurizer heaters while operating the RCS in a water solid mode with the MDHRS in operation creates- the potential for overpressurization of the MDHRS due to volumetric expansion of the ractor coolant as a result of heat input to thereactor coolant. The licensee has calcualted that the electrical energization of all the pressurizer heaters (1638 kw) would result in a volumetric expansion on the reactor coolant which would require a compensating relief capacity of 8.6 gpm. The MDHRS has an installed relief valve capacity of 53.5 gpm. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's result of this potential overpressurization event and has performed an independent check, the results of which are in agreement with the licensee's conclusion. Therefore, we agree that operation of the pressurizer heaters while operating the MDHRS with a water solid RCS would not result in overpressurization of the MDHRS, Overpressurization of the MDHRS due to a malfunction of the SPC system has been precluded by reducing the SPC In- service nitrogen bank pressure to a new operating range of 225 to 400 psig and by the installation of a SPC system pressure relief valve (SPG-R14) which has been set to provide overpressure relief if the SPC system pressure exceeds 125 psig which is substantially below the MDHRS design pressure of 235 psig. The change in the nitrogen bank pressure was approved on July 25, 1980 (Reference 3). The licensee also proposed deleting from proposed Techncial Specification 3.1.1.1 the requirements for a boric acid storage system and an associated flow path to the RCS. -We have reviewed this proposed change and since redundant boron injection flow paths from the BWST to the RCS via the makeup pump and decay heat removal pump exists we find the proposed change acceptable. The licensee's proposed Technical Specification for the MDHRS would require only one operable vIDHRS pump and heat exchanger with an action statement providihg instructions to be taken in the event of their inoperablity. Our position is that this Technical Specification should require the operability of both MDHRS pumps and heat exchangers and the associated flow path and that applicable action statements should be supplied dealing with the inoperability of the various components in the MDHRS. The staff's position is consistent with the operability requirements for similar systems (e.g., proposed Tedhnical Specifications 3.7.2.1, 3.7.3.1 and 3.7.4.1) in which the redundant systems are required operable and action statements are provided for when one or both systems are inoperable.

For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. George A. Fitzsinmons, Secretary. November 17,1980. No. SR-NASD-80-18] National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; Proposed Rule Change by Self-Regulatory Organization Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), as amended by Pub. L. No. 94-29, 16 (June 4, 1975), notice Is hereby given that on October 10, 1980, the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a proposed rule change as follows: The NASD's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change Text of Proposed Rule Change The following is the ful text of proposed amendments to Section B.3. of Part II of Schedule D of the Association's By-Laws (language to be deleted is bracketed, new language is italicizedj. Part II, Paragraph B.3.h. h in the case of stock the total number of shares publicly held shall be less than 100,000 (shares held directly or indirectly by any officer or director of the issuer and by any person who Is the beneficial owner of more than ten percent of the class shall ordinarily not be considered as being publicly hold]; in the case of rights or warrants, the total number of rights or warrants initially. issued shall be less than 100,000;77212 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices Part I, Paragraphs B.3.m. and B.3.n. m. in the case of rights or warrants, the underlying security [shall] is not [be] an authorized security unless such underlying security is listed on a registered national securities exchange (if the underlying security is authorized, or if it is listed on a national securities exchange, the number of [warrants publicly held] rights or warrants initially issued shall be considered only in conjunction with initial authorization); or n. in the case of units not yet authorized, one of the component parts of the unit fails to comply with the requirements for eligible securities not yet authorized; in the case of units already authorized, one of the component parts of the unit fails to comply with the requirements for authorized securities or no market maker is registered in the unit. [(The number of units publicly held shall be considered only in conjunction with initial authorization.]] Part HI, Paragraph C.2.j. j. in the case of rights or warrants, the underlying security [shall] is not [be] an authorized security. [(If the underlying security is authorized the number of\" warrants publicly held shall be considered only in conjunction with initial authorization.)] The NASD's Purpose of Proposed Rule Change The purpose of the proposed rule change is to provide, in the case of rights or warrants of domestic issuers, aminimum standard of 100,000 rights or warrants initially issued. In addition, it eliminates reference to such a standard in the case of domestic units as well as rights and warrants of foreign issuers. The NASD's Basis Under the Act for the Proposed Rule Change Section 15A(b](11) provides that an association of brokers and dealers shall not be registered as a national securities association unless the Commission determines that the rules of the association contain provisions governing the form and content of quotations relating to securities sold otherwise than on a national securities exchange, which may be distributed or published by any member or other persons associated with a member, and the persons to whom such quotations may be supplied. Such rules relating to quotations shall be designed to produce fair and informative quotations to prevent fictitious or misleading quotations and to promote orderlyprocedures for collecting, distributing and publishing quotations. Comments Received From Members, Participants or Others on the Proposed Rule Change Comments were neither solicited nor received. The NASD's Statement on Burden on Competition The proposed rule change will clearly provide that a minimum number of rights or warrants must have been issued for inclusion in NASDAQ. The Association believes that the requirement that 100,000 rights or warrants must have been initially issued provides sufficient depth to the market to prevent any potential manipulation. A similar requirement is not necessary in the case of units because of the close relationship between the prices of units and the underlying securities, each of which have to qualify independently. The Association believes, therefore, that any burdens on competition are incidential and the proposed rule change is in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. On or before December 26,1980, or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the above-mentioned self- regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: (a) By order approve such proposed rule chahge, or (b) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.

Other securities are appraised at values deemed best to reflect their fair value as determined in good faith by or under the supervision of officers of the Applicant in a manner specifically authorized by the Board of Directors. Applicant proposes to effect sales, redemptions and repurchases of its shares at net asset value calculated to the nearest one cent on a shaye having a value of one dollar. Rule 22c-1 under the Act provides, in pertinent part, that no registered investment company or principal underwriter thereof issuing any redeenable security shall sell, redeem, or repurchase any such security except at a price based on the current net asset value of such security which is next computed after receipt of a tender of such security forredemption or of an order to purchase or sell such security. Rule 2a-4 under the Act provides, as here relevant, that \"current net asset value\" of a redeemable security issued by a registered investment company used in computing its price for purposes of distribution, redemption and repurchase shall be-determined with reference to (1) current market value for portfolio securities with respect to which market quotations are readily available and (2) for other securities and assets, fair value as determined in goodfaith by the board of directors of the registered company. In Release No. 9786 the Commission issued an interpretation of Rule 2a-4 expressing its view that (1) it is inconsistent with the provisions of Rule 2a-4 for money market funds to value their assets on an amortized cost basis except with respect to portfolio securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less and provided that such valuation method is determined to be appropriate by each respective fund's board of directors, and (2) it is inconsistent with the provisions of Rule\" 2a-4 for money market funds to \"round off\" calculations of their net asset value per share to the nearest one cent on a share value of $1.00, because such a calculation might have the effect of masking the impact of changing values of portfolio securities and therefore might not \"reflect\" such funds' proper portfolio valuation as required by Rule 2a-4: ' Section 6(c) of the Act provides, in part, that the Commission may, by order upon application, conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person; security or transaction, or any class orclasses orpersons, securities or transactions, from any provision or. provisions of the Act or any rule or .regulation thereunder, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes, fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. In support of the relief requested, Applicant represents that in the view of its management, a stable $1.00 net asset value would benefit Applicant and its shareholders because: (i) shareholders would have the convenience of being able to determine the value of their holdings simply by knowing the number of shares they own and, consequently, (maintenance of investment records would be simplified; (ii) Applicant could be more competitive with the increasing number of money market mutual funds that attempt to maintain a $1.00 net -asset value per share; (iiI) shareholders and potential shareholders generally are not concerned with the minor \\ differences which might occur between yield achieved through \"market\" pricing and the yield computed by using the\"penny rounding\" valuation method described herein; and (iv) if the net asset value of Applicant were, in fact, ,maintained, at a constant price, there would be no realization of nominal capital gains and losses that might otherwise occurwith a \"floating\" net asset value. Applicant further represents that many shareholders-, including bothfinancial institutions and individuals, have indicate that they strongly favor a ,stable $1.00 net asset value per share. The Board of Directors of Applicant firther believes that computing its not asset value per share to the nearest one cent on a share value of one dollar as described above will allow Applicant to maintain a constant net asset value per share under most circumstances and, thereby, permit Applicant to serve tho interests and requirements of its shareholders notwithstanding its usae of pricing methods other than amortized cost for valuing its portfolio instruments having remaining maturities in excess of 60 days. The application further represents that the Board of Directors has determined in good faith that this method of calculating the net asset value per share of Applicant, under such circumstances, is appropriate. Applicant further states that the following conditions may be imposed in any order granting the exemptions it has requested: 1. That Applicant's Board of Directors, in supervising Applicant's operations and delegating special responsibilities involving portfolio management to the Applicant's investment adviser, underakes (as a particular responsibility within the Board's overall duty of care owed to Applicant's shareholders) to assure, to the extent reasonably practical, taking into account current market conditions affecting the Applicant's inveslment objective, that Applicant's net asset value per share as computed for purposes of effecting sales, redemptions and repurchases of its shares, rounded to the nearest one cent, will not deviate from $1.00. 2. That Applic nt will seek to maintain a dollar-welghted average portfolio maturity appropriate to its objective of maintaining a stable price per share, and that Applicant will not (1) purchase an instrument with a remaining maturity greater than one year, or (ii) maintain a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity in excess of 120 days. 3. That Applicant's purchases of portfolio instruments, including repurchase agreements, will be limited to those U.S. dollar denominaied instruments which the Board of Directors determines present minimal credit risks, and which are of high quality as determined by any major rating service or, in the case of any instrument that is not rated, of comparable quality as determined by the Board. For the foregoing reasons, Applicant submits that the exemptions from the provisions of Rule 2a-4 and 22c-1 under the Act which it has requested are77214 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.

[FR Doc. 80-36337 Filed :45 am] BILLING CODE 6010-01-M No. 11445; 812-47061 Rowe Price New Horizons Fund, Inc.; Filing of Application November 17, 1980. Notice is hereby given that Rowe Price New Horizons Fund, Inc. (\"Applicant\"), 100 East Pratt Street, Baltimore, MD 21202, a no-load, open- end, diversified management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (\"Act\"), filed an application for an order of the Commission on July 28, 1980, and an amendment thereto on November 12, 1980, pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Act declaring that Paul M. Wythes shall not be considered an \"interested person\" of the Applicant or its investment adviser, T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. (\"PriceAssociates\"), as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Act by reason of his status as a limited partner of Hambrecht & Quist, a California limited partnership registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All interested persons are referred to the application on file with the Commission for a statement of the representations contained therein, which are summarized below, The Applicant is a Maryland corporation. The investment objective of the Applicant is long-term growth of capital through investment primarily in stock of small growth companies in which mangement believes have the potential to become major companies in the future. The board of directors of Applicant has determined to consider Mr. Wythes for election as a director of the Applicant on condition that the order requested in the subject application is granted by the Commission. Mr. Wythes was a founding director on the National Venture Capital Association in Washington, D.C. (1972- 75). Mr. Wythes was a director and president of the Western Association of Venture Capitalists of San Francisco, California from 1970 through 1974' Between 1954 and 1963, Mr. Wythes was- Senior Marketing Engineer for the Industrial Products Group of Honeywell, Inc., selling scientific and industrial instrumentation throughout northern California. From 1963 to 1964, Mr. Wythes was employed by Beckman Instruments, Inc., as an associate on their corporate staff involved in long- range planning, mergers, acquisitions, market and product studies worldwide. Applicant 9tates that Mr, Wythes is presently and since 1979 has been a limited partner in the firm of Hambrecht & Quist, a California limited partnership which is registered as a broker-dealer with the Commission. Mr. Wythes is not otherwise employed or compensated by the firm, and he does not participate in the management of the firm. Mr. Wythes has also advised the Applicant that for the year 1979 his share of the profits of Hambrecht & Quist Was less than 15 percent of his total income. The application indicates that Mr. Wythes is also and since 1970 has been, one of four general partners of Sutter Hill Ventures (\"Sutter Hill\"), a California limited partnership which makes venture capital investments. Mr. Wythes is also a director of various portfolio companies of Sutter Hill. One other general partner of Sutter Hill is also a limited partner of Hambrecht & Quist, with an interest in its profits and losses identical to that of Mr. Wythes. The total of their combined interest inthe profits and losses of Hambrecht & Quist is substntially less than 5 percent. Mr. Wythes h as advised the Applicant that his salary as a general partner of Sutter Hill and his income from investments provide the major portion of his total income. Applicant states that decisions with respect to the purchase and sale of portfolio securities on behalf of the Fund are made by officers of the Applicant pursuant to recommendations of Price Associates. All of such officers are also officers of Price Associates. In selecting broker-dealers, consideration is given to such factors as the price of the security, the rate of the commission, the size and difficulty of the order, the reliability, integrity, financial condition and general execution and- operational capability of competing broker-dealers, and the brokerage and research service which they provide to Price Associates or to the Applicant, The board of directors does not participate in the allocation of the Applicant's brokerage, but reviews such allocations on the basis of quarterly and other periodic reports furnished to it by Price Associates. In the years 1979, 1978 and 1977, the Applicant paid Hambrecht & Quist brokerage commissions (including d-scodnts received in connection with underwritings) of $17,296, $31,031 and $23,659, respectively. The Applicant states that it has been advised that Price Associates anticipates that in the future Applicant's brokerage will be allocated in the same manner and approximately to the same extent as in the past without regard to whether or not Mr. Wythes is elected to the Applicant's board, subject in each case to compliance with the applicable rules of the Commission under the Act. In the opinion of Price Associates, Hambrecht & Quist is one of the most knowledeable firms in the United States in terms of its ability to find and evaluate small, high technology companies of the type that might be suitable for investment by the Applicant, and is, in addition, an active market maker in the securities of such companies. Applicant asserts that if it were not able to continue to deal through or with Hambrecht & Quist, the Applicant might be deprived of (i} the opportunity to purchase or sel securities for which Hambrecht & Quist is considered the most able broker-dealer to effectuate such transactions, and (ii) an important source of investment information. The application states that at the present time Applicant owns securities of one company which is also owned by Sutter Hill, and the securities of one77215 Federal Register I Vol. 45, Np. 227 [ Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices other company which was previously but is not now owned by Sutter Hill. The Applicant presently holds one additional security which was formerly (but is not now) held by Sutter Hill. The boatd of directors of the Applicant has determined that if Mr. Wythes becomes a director of the Applicant it will not acquire securities of any company in which Sutter Hill holds an investment unless and until the desirability of such investment has been approved by a majority of the non-interested directors of the Applicant at the time of such acquisition other than Mr. Wythes. Any such investment will in any event be subject to an investment restriction of the Applicant which prohibits the Applicant from purchasing the securities of any issuer if any officer or director of the Applicant owns more than Y2 of 19, or if all officers and directors of the Applicant together, own more than 5% of the securities of such issuer. The Appli*cant has represented that in applying such restriction it will treat all securities owned by Sutter Hill as if they were owned individually by Mr. Wythes to the extent of his interest in the profits and losses of Sutter Hill. Section 2(a)(19) of the Act, in pertinent part, defines an interested person of an investment'pompany or an investment adviser as any broker or dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or any affiliated person of such broker or dealer. Section 2(a)(3) of the Act defines an \"affiliated person\" bf another person to include any partner of such other person. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that, ' the Commission may conditionally or ,unconditionally exempt any person from any provision of the Act if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. The Application states that in the opinion of the board of directors of the Applicant, Mr. Wythes is a man of recognized integrity, intelligence, judgment, independence and standing who would contribute greatly to the perspective of the board in evaluating the performance of the Applicant and Price Associates in investing in smaller public companies because of his experience in venture capital investing. The Applicant states that its b6ard of directors has noted that, if Hambrecht & Quist were a corporation, the interest of Mr. Wythes in its profits and losses would be less than the minimum amount necessary to constitute him an affiliated person of that firm under the definitionof affiliated person in Section 2(a)(3) of the Act. The Applicant states that, in the opinion of the board of the Applicant, a person whose sole relationship to a broker-dealer is the ownership of a linited partnership interest of' substantially less than 5%, is necessarily further removed from management than he would be if he held voting stock of.a corporation and was in a position to participate in the selection of management. Further, Applicant states that since Mr. Wythes would not be deemed to be an interested person of Hambrecht & Quist if he held voting ' stock with a commensurate interest in profits and losses which put him in a position to participate in the selection of management, the relationship of Mr. Wythes to Hambrecht & Quist is not the type of relationship intended to be subsumed within the statutory definition of interested person. Accordingly, the Applicant has requested that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 6(c) declaring that Mr. Wythes shall not be deemed to an interested director of the Applicant solely by reason of his status as a limited partner of Hambrecht & Quist. As a condition to the granting of the order requested by the application, the Fund has agreed to an undertaking that: (i) Mr. Wythes will not be counted as a non-interested director in the determination of the number of non- interested directors of the Applicant for the purposes of Section 10(a) of the Act, although he will be counted as'a director for the purposes of determining the total number of directors to whom the Section 10(a) ratio test applies, and (ii) Mr. Wythes will not vote on any matters relating to the allocation of any portfolio brokerage by the Applicant or the selection of dealers with which the Applicant effects portfolio transactions as principal (including, but not limited to, transactions to-which sections 10(f) or 17(a) of the-Act or Rules 10f-3 or 17e- -1 thereunder are applicable), or to any other matter involving any relationship between the Applicant and Hambrecht & Quist; provided, however, that for the purposes of determining the number of votes of interested as well as non- .inteiested directors required to take action on any such matter, Mr. Wythes will be counted as a director in. determining the total number of directors and will be counted as a non- interested director in determining the total number of non-interested directors. Mr. Wythes shall.be treated as a non- interested director for all other purposes under the Act (except Section 10(a) as explained under (I) above), including,but not limited to, Sections 15(c) and 17(g) of the Act. Notice is further given that any interested person may, not later than December 9, 1980, at 5:30 p.m., submit to the Commission in writing a request for a hearing on the matter accompanied by a statement as to the nature of his interest, the reasons for such request, and the issues, if any, of fact or law proposed to be controverted, or he may request that he be notified if the Commission shall order a hearing thereon. Any such communication should be addressed: Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, D.C. 20549.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Proposed Rule Change by Midwest Clearing Corp. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), as amended by Pub. L. No. 94-29, 16 (June 4,1975), notice Is hereby given that on November 10, 1080 the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a proposed rule change as follows: Statement of Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change Rule 5, Section S,of the Rules of the Midwest Clearing Corporation is hereby amended as follows: Additions Italicized-[Deletions Bracketed]77216 I I I Federal Register / Vol. 45. No, 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 I Notices Rule 5 Security Positions Under CNS Security Loans Sec. 5. In the event the amount of a security subject to pending Security Withdrawal Requests shall exceed the available amount of the security delivered to the Corporation against short value positions, the Corporation shall fill such Request to the extent possible out of existing loan free positions, and such positions shall be changed to lean value positions as a result thereof in accordance with the followin. The loan free poeition of the Partic4ant In the claw of Ptrnidpants with the kighest slook loon priority who has had a loan free position in such security for the longest number of consecutive days preceding the delivery without moving any part thereof to a loan value posifien shall be change to a loan value position. In the event that both long value positions and loan kee positions remain with respect to any sec-rity on any business day after the procedures described in Section 4 and the preceding paragraph of this Section 5 have been completed, the long value positions shall be changed to clearing free positions, and the loan free positions shall be changed to loan value position, until all long value positions of all loan free positions have been elm-inated, whichever occus first. Long value positions shall be changed into clearing free positons in accordance with the system of priorities set forth in the second paragraph of Section 4, and loan free positions shall be changed into loan value positions in accordance with the system of priorities set forth in the preceding paragraph of this Section 5. Securities held in a Participant's loan free and loan value positions shall not be offset against the Participant's short value positions unless the Member shall specifically instruct the Corporation to do so. Statement of Basis and Purpose The basis and purpose of the foregoing rule change is as follows: The proposed rule change basically clarifies MCC's Automatic Stock Loan Program which is designed to satisfy priority needs for stock that are not filled via normal deliveries from participants. The present system takes stock out of loan free positions on a first-in, first-out basis. The rule change will allow MCC to establish prioritized classes of Participants to-which thisfirst-in, first-out procedure will still apply within each.class. The proposed rule change promotes the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions by providing a more equitable use of the clearing agency among participants. It is also designed to help perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and acurate clearance and settlement of securities transaction by making MCC more competitive in providing sen ices to its Participants. The Midwest Clearing Corporation believes that no burdens have been placed on competition. The proposed rule change would, in fact, enhance competition in that it will provide a more equitable means of allocating stock loan priority to participants. By December n, 1980. or within such longer period jil as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding, or (uj as to which the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: (a) By order approve such proposed rule change, or (b) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons desiring to make written submissloms should file 6 copies thereof with the Secretary of the Commission. Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, D C. 20549. Copies of all such filings with respect to the foregoing and of all written submissions will be available for inspection and copying in the Public Reference Room. 1100 L Street N.W., Washington, D.C. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self- regulatory organization.

Feese, Entry, Examination, and Liquidation Branch, Duty Assessment Division, Office of Trade Operations, U.S. Customs Service, 1301 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, D.C. 202;9 (202-566-81). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 205(a}{4)(C) of the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), provides that the Secretary of State shall certify to the Secretary of the Treasury any determination that a fishing vessel of the United States, while fishing in waters beyond any foreign nation's territorial sea, to the extent that such sea is recognized by the United States, has been seized by a foreign nation as a consequence of a claim of jurisdiction not recognized by the United States. The responsibility for this certification was delegated to the Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs by Department of State Delegation of Authority No. 138 of April 29, 1977. Pursuant to section 205(b) of the Act, upon receiving this certification, the Secretary of the Treasury is required to take such action as may be necessary and appropriate to prohibit the importation of all fish and fish products from the fishery involved. Section 205(c) of the Act provides that if the Secretary of State finds that the reasons for the import prohibition under section 205 no longer prevail, the Secretary of State shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury, who shall promptly remove the import prohibition. On October 21,1980, the CAROL LINDA, CINDY ANN, and MARY S., fishing vessels of the United States, were seized by authorities of the government of Ecuador, respectively, 114, 165, and 112.5 miles off the shore of Ecuador for fishing for tuna without Ecuadorean authorization. Ecuador claims jurisdiction over tuna within 200 miles of its coast. The United States does not recognize this jurisdiction. Pursuant to section 205(a) of the Act, on November 4,1980, the AssistantSecretary of State certified the seizure of these three vessels as meeting the requirements of section 205(a)(4)(C) of the Act. Determination Under the authority of sections 205[b) and (c) of the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976, on November 5,1980, the Secretary of the Treasury determined that the entry for consumption or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of tuna and tuna products from Ecuador (the\"country of origin\") is prohibited until the Department of State notifies the Secretary of the Treasury that the reasons for this prohibition no longer prevail. Tuna and tuna products processed in Ecuador to any extent, including packing in ice, will be considered tuna or tuna products from Ecuador. At this time, this prohibition does not extend to in-bond shipments to and through the United States. Drafting Information The principal author of this docunent was Barbara E.

The Final Impact Statement desuribing the options considered in developing this final ruleand the impact of implementing each option is available on request for the above named individual. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This- final action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established in Secretary's Memorandum 1955 to implement E.ecutive Order 12044, and has been classified \"not significant.\" Background In the June 8,1979 Federal Register (44 FR 33380, et seq.), the Department issued an emergency rulemaking implementing several miscellaneous amendments and interpretations of the food stamp regulations that had been issued in the October 17, 1978 Federal Register (43 FR 47846, et seq.). Two of those \" amendments pertained to State agency liabilities and Federal sanctions. The first implemented Section.11(h) of the ,Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. Z020) giving the Secretary the authority to demand payment from State agencies of Federal monies lost as the result of negligence or fraud on the part of the State agencies in the certification of applicant households. The second amendment implemented the provisions -of Section 14 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 2023) which required that State agencies- aggrieved by claims issued byFNS be- given opportunities to have the claims reviewed through an administrative review process. These two provisions of the overall State agency liability and Federal sanction process were issued as emergency rules because of the imminent implementation of other regulations implementing the Act. In the November 9, 1979 Federal Register (44 FR 65318), the Department proposed a set of rules to implement all of the State agency liability and Federal sanction provisions of the Act. That proposed rulemaking included, almost verbatim, the negligence and administrative review rules that were issued on June 8, 1979. The Departinent did this so that-readers would be able to comment on the entire package of sanction and liability rules being issued pursuant to the Act. In addition to the negligence and administrative review regulations, the proposed rules contained provisions pertaining to absolute State agency liabilities, ' injunctive relief, and the suspension and disallowance of State agency administrative funds. , The Department received two sets of comments on the sanctions and liabilities regulations. The first set came in response to the June 8, 1979 emergency rulemaking, the second set in response to the November 9, 1979 proposed rulemaking. All pertinentcomments concerning both rulemakings were taken into consideration in developing these final rules. General The Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended, provides for injunctive relief and the suspension and disallowance of administrative funds to enforce compliance with the Act, the regulations issued pursuant to the Act, and the FNS- approved State Plans of Operation, which includes the FNS-approved State Operating Guidelines. The Act also established two categories of State agencyliability with respect to agency operation of the Program. Section 7(f) (7 U.S.C. 2016(o) of the Act makes State agencies liable for issuance losses, while Section 11(h) makes State agencies liable for certification losses due to negligence or fraud in the State agencies' operations. In developing these final rules, the Department tried to delineate, as clearly as possible, the liability of the State agencies, the use of sanctions available to FNS, and the procedures State agencies must follow to obtain an administrative review of claims filed against them. Since issuance of the proposed regulations on November 9, 1979, Congress has enacted new legislation (Pub. L. 96-249, Sec. 120, 94 Stat, 362, May 26, 1980) which clarifies the tools available'to the Department to enforce compliance with the Act. Section 11(g) of the 1977 Act, as amended, now makes clear that the Secretary has authority to seek injunctive relief and/or withhold administrative funds from a State if he finds a State agency failed to comply with any provisions of the Food Stamp Act, the regulations issued pursuant to the Act, or the State Plan of Operation. In fact, Section 11(g) contains a requirement that the Secretary withhold administrative funds, in an amount he deems appropriate, if he determines that a State agency has failed to comply with any provisions of the Act, regulations, State Plan, or standards for efficient and effective administration. The standards for efficient and effective Program administration were defined in the Performance Reporting System rules (45 FR 15884 et. seq.) as the provisions of the Act, regulations and FNS-approved State Plan of Operation. In devising the proposed regulations, the Department assumed it had the authority to sanction State agencies, whether or not it chose to seek injunctive relief through referral to the Attorney General. Pub. L. 96-249 confirms this'authority. The House Committee Report on the Food Stamp Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations Act Amendments of 1980 (Pub. L. 96- 249) states: \"The Department's proposed and disputed regulations of November 9,1979, are consistent with the Committee's approach and the language of the section and legislative history as well * * * (Tihe Committee has decided to revise and clarify the sanctions provisions of the 1977 Act. essentially collapsing the liability provisions of section 16(b) and 11(g) in order to make the Secretary's options as clear as they already should be.\" House Rpt. No. 96-788 (House Report) 96th Cong., 2nd Sess., p. 140. The final regulations retain the broad authority described in the proposed regulations for the Department to enforce State agency compliance with the Act, regulations, and State plans. The final regulations also retain the flexibility allowing the Secretary to seek injunctive relief and/or withhold administrative funds from a State agency, simultaneously or in sequence, to assure proper State agency performance. The Department recognizes that the law and these regulations provide broad, sweeping authority for the Secretary to sanction State agencies for failure to comply with innumerable Program requirements. The Department agrees with State agency comment that a primary method for achieving State agency compliance with the law should be informal discussion and conciliation. The Department has no intention of utilizing the sanction process to enforce absolute compliance with every Program requirement no matter how minor it may be. It is the intention of the Department to utilize its authority to sanction State agencies in a reasonable manner. While the use of this authority may vary from situation to situation, the use of sanctions will not ordinarily be the first approach employed by the Department to achieve satisfactory State agency performance in the administration of the Program. The Department fully understands that a heavy-handed use of sanctions can be, in the long run, antithetical to the Program's best interests. State Agency Liabilities Section 7(f) of the Act states that: \"Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the State agency shall be responsible to the Secretary for any financial losses involved in the acceptance, storage and issuance of coupons.\" (7 U.S.C. 2016(f) (Supp. I 1977)). This section of the final rules sets forth the types of financial losses for which State ageqcies will be held liable. Only a few of the comments addressing this section of the proposedrules offered specific suggestions for change. Those adopted were aimed at the overall goal of clarifying the rules. For example, the proposed rules specified that State agencies would be -held liable for \"duplicate ATP transactions caused by State agency error.\" At the suggestion of FNS' Mountain Plains Regional Office, this has been changed to \"the duplicate issuance of benefits caused by State agency error.\" The Department made this change recognizing that it did not intend to absolve State agencies with HER card issuance systems of liability for duplicate Issuances due to State agency error. However, we have added a caveat that State agencies will not be held liable for the duplicate transaction of ATP cards if the duplicate transactions occurred as a result of events beyond the State agency's control. This is necessaxy because duplicate transactions, by their very nature, do not lend themselves to a strict liability approach. Some duplicate transactioqls may occur, for example, if ATP cards are stolen and cashed. As a result, duplicate issuances that are beyond the practical preventive ability of the State are not considered a State agency liability by these regulations. At the same time, State failure to install proper issuance controls can increase duplicate transactions beyond a \"non- preventable\" level. States would be liable for such duplicate transactions. Two comments recommended that the Department delete the provision holding -State agencies liable for coupons lost in disasters, to the extent that the State agency could not show that the coupons were destroyed and not redeemed. This suggestion was not adopted since the Department reasoned that the occurrence of disasters did not relieve State agencies of their responsibility to account for coupons in their possession. However, the wording of the provision in the proposed rules did appear to be more stringent than the Department intended. Therefore, the Department reworded the provision so that it now reads that State agencies will be held liable for coupons lost in disasters unless they can provide reasonable evidence that the coupons were destroyed and therefore not redeemied. The Department does not anticipate that this provision will be invoked very often. In the past, the same provisip was used very infrequently and only when a situation arose in which it was clear that coupons missing after a disaster had not been destroyed in the disaster. No change in the frequency of use is envisioned.The major change in this section is the result of the Department's changes in the definition of negligence. The definition of negligence included in the June 8.1979 emergency rulemaking and in the November 9,1979 proposed rulemaking gave the Secretary authority. to bill State agencies for financial losses resulting from State agency negligence in certification and issuance activities. Several commenters objected to this definition, noting that Section 11(h) of the Act gave the Secretary the authority to bill State agencies only for losses due to negligent certification actions. These commenters believed that the emergency and proposed regulations exceeded statutory authority in that they applied the authority to bill for losses due to negligende in activities other than certification. This viewpoint was buttressed by legislative history in the House Committee on Agriculture's Report accompanying the 1980 Amendments to the Food Stamp Act (Pub. L. 96-249). It was noted in that Report that the Secretary could respond to State agency noncompliance with Program requirements by making ..* * a negligence claim (but only if the program failure related to household certification)\" or by holding \" * * * States strictly liable for financial losses (but only if losses occurred in the issuance functions) * *\" (House Report, p. 139). Acting un the arguments raised from these two sources, the Department has narrowed the definition of negligence. The definition now clearly subjects certification functions to the negligence provisions, while clearly identifying issuance functions as being subject to the absolute liability provisions. Consequently. there are several differences between the proposed and final rules in this section. Liability for overissuances to households who received benefits after their certification periods expired, overissuances caused by State agency failure to process promptly public assistance changes, and overissuances assessed due to missing documentation such as casefiles, has been deleted from the strict liability section. A second major change in this section was ijade in the provisions applicable to court suit liabilities. The changes are due to the reorganization and clarification of the rules. The State agencies' responsibilities for acting and reporting on court suits that they become involved in have been deleted from \u00a7 276.2 of the rules and included in \u00a7 272.4(f). Thus, Part 276 does not contain any rules other than rules77259 77260 -.Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations directly.related to State agency liabilities and Federalsanctions: A final issue bearing discussion is objection raised-by several commen to the idea of \"absolute\" or \"strict\" liability for financial losses involved issuance, The Texas State agency -..-recommended thata tolerance limit established which would have to-be exceeded by a State agency before assessment of liability. The South Carolina State agency suggested that liability be limited to instances in which a State agency w found guilty of gross negligence, whi the Kentucky Stateagency suggeste( be limited to instances in which Stat agency mismanagement was-involve The California State agency asked tl good cause provision be included in rules. The Department considered these suggestions but did not adopt them because neither the statute nor the -related legislative history support th inclusion of a tolerance limit or good cause provision in the issuance sanc rules. A close examination of the lay reveals that it is the lack of a toleran level or good cause provision in the issuance sanction rules that separate those rules from the certification sanction rules. Ther6 is an implicit gi cause provision inherent in the certification sanction rules, since the rules require that the Secretary makc determination of negligence prior to assessing liability to'a State agency. There is no absolute or strict liabilit3 applied to certification operations ar there is no good cause provision in t issuance sanction rules. Rather, Congress intended thatState agencic be held-liable for \" * * any financit losses involved in acceptance, storal and issuance of coupons.\" (Section 7 Food Stamp Act 6f 1977, as amended .\" This intent was'echoed in the House Committee Report on the 1980 - Amendments to the Food Stamp -Act 1977 where it is noted that the Secrel can \"* * * hold States strictlyliabh financial losses * * *' that occur in issuance functions (Emphasis added, House Report, p. 139). Therefore, absolute or strict liability has been --retainedwith regard to-issuance operations. -. Negligence or Fraud Many of the comments submitted-( the negligence and fraud section of t proposed and emergency regulations contained objections to the definitioi negligence. Most of these comments stated that the definition was too brc and/or imprecise. In response, the Department narrowed the definition negligence by deleting all referencesissuance. As explained above, issuance s activities will be subject to the absolute .the --liability provisions of the rules while ters ocertification activities will be subject to the negligence provisions. This narrows I in the scope of the definition. As set forth -in these final rules, a State agency can\" be be found negligent if there is a loss of Federal funds due to the State agency's disregard of Federal requirements contained in the Act, the regulations, or the FNS-approved State Plan of Operation. Additionally, a State agencyas may be found negligent if it implements, le without first obtaining FNS approval, l it -procedures that deviate from procedures .e required in these sources and result in a -d.. loss of Federal funAds. Thus, if a State iat a -agency fails to implement a regulatory the change and-that failure results in a loss of Federal funds, the State agency may be charged with negligence and a claim for the lost funds may be filed. Likewise, if a State agency, without first obtaining e FNS approval, implements new to verification prbcedures that are differenition from the verification procedures , -prescribed by the Department.and thece new procedures result in a loss of Federal funds, the State-agency may be e found negligent and a claim for the lost funds may be filed.reod Deleted from the definition is the Ise provision that authorized FNS to a determine a State agency to be negligentif the State agency failed to maintain proper-controls over certification,- r functions and-the failure resulted in a d loss of-Federal funds. This latter he provision was deleted primarily due to -the Department's concern that it !s duplicated the Quality Control Sanction al System. (Rules to establish this system, ge, which was mandated by Section 126 the(f, 1980 Amendments to the Food Stamp Act (94Stat. 364), were proposed in the October 3, 1980 Federal Register). The Department does not-intend.to establish of .-sanctions requiring that State agencies tary be held liable and billed twice for the a.for same deficiencies. The deletion of this particular provision should make this clear. However, if situations arise where there are overlaps in liability provisions, the Department-will not double-bill State agencies. --Several commenters..objected to the -. provision that-authorized FNS to use -statistidally valid projections in on determining the amount of loss caused he by a State agency's negligence. Most of these commenters requested that the i of provision be eliminated; some suggested -that it be expanded to explain the iad techniques-that would be used. The Department decided to retain the of provisioi. (It should be noted, however, to that a similar provision-in the proposedState agency liabilities section was deleted when certification losses wore deleted from that section.) It Is the Department's position, supported by its Office of the Inspector General, that statistically valid projections provide an accurate view of the extent of deficiencies in a State agency's operations and that they also present accurate projections of the amounts of loss resulting from the deficiencies. The Department did Include a basic description in the rules of the techniques that will be used in making statistical projections. Whenever a statistical projection is made it will be made using a 95 percent, one-sided confidence level, In other words, after a sample Is completed a range of loss'will be established such that it can be predicted, with 90 percent certainty, that the actual loss Is within the range. If a billing is made, the billing will be for thb lowest amount in the range. Thus, It can be predicted, with 95 percent certainty, that the actual loss is either the billed amount or higher. Some commenters suggested that the Department include a tolerance limit in the negligence definition. Others suggested that a good cause provision be included. Still others requested that the Department describe in the regulations the procedures that would be used in determining whether a State agency had been negligent. The common theme underlying all of these comments was a concern that the Department would use negligence sanctions on a frequent basis in response to very minor certification deficiencies. It was pointed out in the preamble to the proposed regulations that \"(w)hile the regulations reflect the legislative change from gross negligence to negligence, the Department does not intend to establish a negligence billing for all losses of Federal funds. Consideration would be given to the -circumstances causing the loss and the ,steps the State. agency took td prevent the loss from recurring before determining negligence.'! (44 FR 65323). The Department has no plans to initiate or follow a different course of action, Thus, readers should be assured that minor certification deficiencies discovered by the Department will not result in negligence billings. .Additionally, it should be noted that, .'given the policy-stated above, the -. Department cannot issue a negligence charge where there is good cause for overissuances; good cause is an Implicit but inherent aspect of negligence. Collection of Claims The proposed rulemaking contained provisions that specified procedures for Federal 'Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations 77261 payment of absolute liability and negligence claims. In both provisions it was noted that State agencies would be billed for appropriate amounts and asked to remit payment of the losses. If payment was not made, the provisions allowed FNS to recover the amount of the claims through offsets to the State agencies' Letters of Credit. Several commenters objected to this recovery method. They noted that if offsets were used, services to participants and applicants could suffer from the decrease in administrative funds. Some commenters contended that the offset method of recovering absolute liability claims and negligence claims was not provided for in the Food Stamp Act and, therefore, legally could not be used. The Department carefully considered these comments but decided to retain the provisions as proposed. The Department realizes that the offset method of collepting claims could have detrimental effects on a State agency's administration of the Program. Therefore, it is hoped that State agencies that receive claims will remit payments for them and avoid offsets. If an offset is required, however, FNS has the authority to recover the claim in a single offset or in a series of offsets spread over a period of up to three years. This ability to spread out the offsets, thereby reducing the size of each one, minimizes the negative impatt the offsets would have on State agency operations. The Department disagrees with the contention that it lacks the authority-to offset absolute liability and negligence claims. While no authority to offset is specifically mentioned in the Food Stamp Act, the Department believes it extends from the Secretary's authority to issue regulations necessary for the efficient and effective operation of the program (Section 4(c) of the Act) and from the Federal Claim Collection Act of 1966. This view is supported by the House Committee Report which states, in part, that: .* * the Secretary could send a billing or collect funds through offset under the strict liability or negligence provisions in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, which is applicable to all Federal claims whether or not specifically referred to in a particular statute.\" Emphasis added, House Report p. 142. Suspensions and Disallowances This section of the regulation describes the types of sanctions that may be used if the Department determines that a State agency is operating the Program in an inefficient or ineffective manner, i.e., is out ofcompliance with any provisions of the Act, regulations, or FNS-approved State Plan of Operation. This section also explains the procedures that the Department will follow should it be necessary to use these sanctions. In general, the comments which addressed the provisions of this section supported the proposed rules. However, there were some concerns raised and suggestions made with regard to the warning procedures of the rules. The previous warning process was a two step proces's that included informal and formal warnings, each followed by periods of at least 30 days in which State agencies could take corrective action to eliminate the deficiency and avoid a suspension or disallowance of administrative funds. The Department's experience with this process demonstrated that it often resulted in long delays before corrective action was taken, and thus was not always responsive to problem situations. The Department tried to design a warning process that could be more responsive to problem situations. Thus, the previous informal warning with its automatic 30 day corrective action period was replaced by an advance notification with a corrective action period of unspecified length. The length of time would be decided by FNS at the time of issuance of the advance notification and determined by the circumstances at hand. Further, the proposal would have allowed the Department to dispense with the advance notification and immediately issue a formal warning if the problem involved a State agency's failure to meet the commitments made in an approved corrective action plan. (Since the State agency already knew of problems in these instances and had formulated corrective action, it was reasoned that an advance notification was not necessary.) Several commenters objected to these changes, recommending that advance notifications always be issued before formal warnings, and that the Department establish a specified period of time which must elapse between the issuance of an advance totification and a formal warning. One commenter suggested that this time period be 30 days. Since the adoption of these suggestions would essentially result in the retention of the previous warning process, one which had proven to be unresponsive in some cases, the Department rejected the suggestions. Other commenters recommended that advance notifications and formal warnings specify what action needed to be taken to correct the noted deficiency and, thus, avoid the suspension ordisallowance of funds. State agencies are in the best position to determine what actions will be most effective to correct a deficiency in their administration of the Program. Therefore, State agencies remain responsible for formulating such action. Injunctive Relief The injunctive relief provisions of the proposed regulations have been retained in the final rules. Very few comments were received suggesting changes in these provisions. Two commenters suggested that the Department rely on injunctive relief as the primary tool for enforcement of compliance with Program requirements. The Department did not incorporate this suggestion into the regulations. As was pointed out earlier, it was Congress' intent in providing several compliance tools to give the Secretary flexibility in deciding how best to bring a State agency into compliance with Program requirements. See House Report, pp. 138-139. Therefore, no change was made in the rules that would limit this flexibility. Good Cause The proposed rulemaking did not contain a specific definition of\"good cause\" as it would be applied to sanctions. This did not mean that the Department would not consider good cause in the application of sanctions. Rather, the Department determined that the mechanism used in asserting claims, the warning process, allowed State agencies to show good cause. As the preamble to the proposed rulemaking noted:\" * the Department is proposing to retain a warning process * * to ensure that States have the opportunity to correct problems prior to losing the Federal share of administrative funds through a sanction process.\" (44 FR 65323) Several commenters acknowledged this position but requested that the Department go further and actually define good cause as it would apply to the sanction process. As these commenters pointed out, the opportunity for State agencies to show good faith efforts to correct noncompliance was not adequate to allow all good cause conditions to be taken into account. The House Report. to the 1980 Food Stamp Amendments, Pub. L 96-249, contains legislative history supporting the commenters. In a description of how the sanction process is to work the Report states that: \"The State would be given an adequate opportunity in an appropriate administrative setting to make a showing of good cause for failure to comply * * *. \"Good cause\" would be defined by regulations 77262 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 7- Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations promulgatbd by the Secretary but would not encompass a lack of resources that the State has the ability to remedy and would include external impossibility or programmatic inconsistency.\" House Report, p. 142. In light of the comments received and the legi.slative history of Pub. L. 96-249, the Department developed a good cause provision that will apply to the use of injunctive relief and the withholding of administrative funds for failure to meet efficiency and effectiveness standards. The good cause provision is not applicable to the absolute liability rules nor to, the negligence rules. The Department determined that Congress did not intend to have the good cause provision applied to absolute liability situations and that, as explained above, it is the lack of a good cause provision that sets these liabilities apart. The Department is not applying the good cause provisions to negligence claims since, as explained above, a lack of godd cause is inherent in the use of the negligence sanction. As developed, the Department will determine good cause on a case-by-case basis; i.e., each case will be evaluated against the good cause criteria in the definition of good cause before seeking injunctive relief or suspending or disallowing funds. By applying the good cause criteria in this manner, the Department retains the flexibility it needs to make honest and accurate determinations as to whether or not good cause exists. This should work to the advantage of both State agencies and the Department.\" The good cause definition included in the rules is general. It is intended to be general so that the flexibility needed for its equitable use will be enhanced. Readers should not assume however, that the general nature of the definition will lead to nearly automatic findings of good cause. As stated above, the Department fully intends to evaluate each case against the criteria before determining whether good cause exists. Generally, the criteria in the good cause provision follow the reasoning of the language in the House Report. Thus, good cause will include things outside State control, such as natural disasters and strikes, and will not include things within State control, such as lack of resources. In the application of the criteria, the mere existence.of a situation specified in the good cause provision will not result in a finding of good cause. For example, the occurrence of a natural disaster does not necessarily mean that a, State agency had good cause for failing to comply with food stamp. administrative requirements. Thus, if a State agencyfails to use correct pr6cedures during a disaster, the Department might seek to sanction the State agency. Administrative RevieW Process Many commetiters offered suggestions for changes in the administrative review process.Most of these commenters were concerned that iighti and responsibilities were not clear. Taking these comments into account, the Department revised the rules establishing the administative reyiew process. Since-these provisions were extensively rewritten, this portion of the rulemaking is beipg issued as interim final. It will go into effect with the other provisions. The Department is accepting comments on these provisions and will publish final administrative review rules in the future. One-particular aspect of the review process, which seven commenters addressed, involved the impartiality of the review official. The commenters recommended that the final rules guarantee that the review authority be an impartial third party. The proposed administrative review rules did not specify whether the official designated, by the Secretary would be an impartial third party. In the preamble to those rules, however\",the Department stated that the review authority designated by the Secretary could be someone with a prior knowledge of the case being 'reviewd. The Department accepted this recommendation and these final rules require that the review authority be a \"neutral third party\" (\u00a7 276.6(h)(i)). This does not mean that the reviewing officials may not be employees of the Department of Agriculture. Secretary's Memorandum No. 2003, Revised, dated January 3, 1980, which establishes the State Food Stamp Appeals Board, provides that \"Persons who are officers or employees of the Department of Agriculture or any of its constituent agencies, except FNS, as well as other, Federal officers or einpfoyees, may serve on the Appeals Board. Persons who are not employed by the Federal Government may also be asked to serve on the Appeals Board. However, no .person who has been associated with the case being appealed shall serve as an Appeals Board member.\" The rules prohibit anyone involved in the original decision to file a claim from reviewing the appeal of the claim. This will ensure that impartiality is maintained so that reviews of claims are conducted in as equitable a manner as possible. Many of the comments received suggested specific 'changes in the processing of appeals. One of these was that State agencies be given the right to an in-person hearing on all claims thatare appealed.The Department accepted this suggestion. As proposed, State agencies had the right to a personal hearing if they appealed negligence claims or disallowances of funds, Thus, the suggestion was that they be given the right to an in-person hearing of appeals of issuance claims. Since these claims will generally be disputes of records such as accountability and inventory reports, the Department does not foresee that in-person hearings will be necessary to reach equitable decisions. The Department believes that in these cases a review of the disputed records along with any other , information provided by the State agency will be adequate. However, to ensure that the appeals process Is as, equitable as possible, the Department will grant State agencies the option of having in-person hearings or reviews of records on all appeals. The rules provide for two types of hearings: hearings before the full Appeals Board and hearings before single hearing officials, Generally, appeals of negligence claims and disallowances of administrative funds will be heard by the full Appeals Board while appeals of other claims, those that would not have had hearings, will be heard by single hearing officials, The rules will allow, however, full Appeals Board hearings of issuance claims and single hearing official hearings of negligence claims and disallowances. Other commenters recommended that suspension of administrative funds be included as claims that are\"appealable.\" The Department did not accept this recommendation. A suspension is not a claim in any way that billings for issuance losses, negligence charges or disallowances are claims. Since State agencies can have their suspended administrative funds restored by correcting the deficiencies that led to the suspension the Department decided not to include suspensions in the administrative review process. Should a State agency fail to take action to correct a deficiency thereby causing a suspension to become a disallowance the State agency can appeal the disallowance, Several commenters requested that the Department revise the time limits included in the rules for requesting reviews and submitting supportive information. The proposed procedures gave State agencies 10 days from the filing of~a claim by the Department to request a claim. These rules also proposed giving State agencies 10 days from the date the request for appeal was acknowledged for State agencies to submit any additional information they Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations had. The final rules alter these time frames. State agencies still must file a request for an appeal within 10 days of receiving a claim. This 10 day limit is set in section 14 of the statute (7 U.S.C. 2023 (Supp. 11977)) and cannot be changed. Requests for appeals filed later than 10 days after receipt of a claim cannot be granted. However, State agencies that request appeals in a timely manner shall have 30 days from the date they submit their request for appeal in which to submit any additional information they want to submit. This should give State agencies time to assemble any data and other supportive information they may have. Other chaiiges in these timeliness requirements were also included in the rules. For instance, the rules now require that State agencies be notified of hearings at least 10 days prior to their occurrence. They also allow State agencies to postpone hearings, provided there is good cause. The Department made other changes in the rules, all designed to clarify the procedures and specify State agencies' v rights and responsibilities. These are all self-explanatory. Implementation These rules are effective on December 22,1980. From that date forward, incidents resulting in claims or injunctive relief shall be subject to the sanctions and liabilities provisions presented here. As of that date the changes made in the administrative review process will be in effect as well. Accordingly, Parts 272 and 276 are amended as follows: PART 272-REQUIREMENTS FOR PARTICIPATING STATE AGENCIES Subparagraph (18) is added to \u00a7 272.1 (g) and paragraph (f) is added to \u00a7 272.4. Both read as follows: \u00a7 272.1 General terms and conditions. * * * * * (g) Implementation. (18) Amendment 166. The provisions of amendment 168 shall be effective on the thirtieth day following their \" publication.

State agencies involved in suits shall, upon request of FNS, take such action as is necessary to join the United States and/ or appropriate officials of the Federal Government, such as the Secretary of USDA or the Administrator of FNS, as parties to the suit. FNS may request to join the following types of suits: (A) Class action suits; (B) A suit in which an adverse decision could have a national impact; (C) A suit challenging Federal policy such as a provision of the Act or regulations or an interpretation of the regulations; or, (D) A suit based on an empirical situation that is likely to recur. (ii) FNS may advise a State agency to' seek a settlement agreement of a court suit if the State agency is being sued because it misapplied Federal policy in administering the Program. (iii) State agencies shall notify FNS when court cases have been dismissed or otherwise settled. State agencies shall also provide FNS with information that is requested regarding the State agency's compliance with the requirements of court orders or settlement agreements. (2) FNS shall notify all State agencies of any suits brought in Federal court that involve FNS' administration of the Program and which have the potential of affecting many State agencies' Progam operations. (State agencies need not be notified of suits brought in Federal Court involving FNS' administration of the Program which may only affect Program operations in one or two States.) The notification provided to State agencies shall contain a description of the Federal policy that is involved in the litigation. (91 Stat. 958 (7 U.S.C. 2011-2027))PART 276--STATE AGENCY LIABILITIES AND FEDERAL SANCTIONS In and a new \u00a7 276.6 is added. With these additions and revisions Part 276 is revised to read as follows: 270.1 Responsibilities and rights. 270.2 State agency liabilities. 270.3 Negligence or fraud. 270.4 Suspension/disallowance of administrative funds. 270.5 Injunctive relief. 27.6 Good cause. 276.7 Administrative review process. 91 Stat. 958, (7 U.S.C. 2011-2027). \u00a7 276.1 Responabliltles and rights. (a) Responsibilities. (1) State agencies shall be responsible for establishing and maintaining secure control over coupons and cash for which the regulations designate them accountable. Except as set forth in \u00a7 276.2(c]iiv), any shortages or losses of coupons or cash shall be a strict State agency liability and the State agency shall pay to FNS, upon demand, the amount of the missing coupons or cash regardless of the circumstances of the loss. (2) State agencies shall be responsible for preventing losses of Federal funds in the certification of households for participation in the Food Stamp Program. If FNS makes a determination that there has been negligeice or fraud on the part of a State agency in the certification of households for participation in the Food Stamp Program, FNS is authorized to bill the State agency for an amount equal to the amount of coupons issued as aresult of the negligence or fraud. (3) State agencies shall be responsible for efficiently and effectively administering the Program by complying with the provisions of the Act, the regulations issued pursuant to the Act, and the FNS-approved State Plan of Operation. A determination by FNS that a State agency has failed to comply with any of these provisions may result in FNS seeking injunctive relief to compel compliance and/or a suspension or disallowance of the Federal share of the State agency's administrative funds. FNS has the discretion to determine in each instance of noncompliance, whether to seek injunctive relief, to suspend or disallow administrative funds, to do both together, or to do each in sequence. (b) Rights. State agencies have the right to appeal all claims brought against them by FNS and be afforded an77263 77264 Federal Register / Vol.- 45, No. 227 / Friday, November-, 21,-.1980 / Rules and Regulatiohs administrative review by a-designee c the secretary.

(2) In computing amounts of losses of Federal funds due to negligence, FNS may use actual, documented amounts or amounts-which have been determined ie -through.the use of statistically valid projections. When a statistically validprojection is used, the methodology will include a 95 percent, one-sided confidence level. (3) FNS will base it determinations of negligence on information drawn from any of a number of sources. These information sources include, but are not' limited to, State and Federal Perf~rmance Reporting reviews, State and Federal audits and investigations, State, corrective action plans and any required reports.

When making such determinations, FNS shall use all information that is available relating to State agencies' administration of the Program. This information includes, but is not limited to, information received from Performance Reporting System reviews, Federhl reviews, audits, investigations, corrective action plans,. financial management reviews, and the public. (2) FNS.may determine a State agency's administration of the Program to be inefficient or ineffective if the State agency fails to comply with the food stamp requirements established by the Food Stamp Act, the regulations issued pursuant to the Act, or the FNS- approved State Plan of Operation. (3) If FNS determines that a State agency's administration of the Program is inefficient or ineffective, FNS may warn the State agency that a suspension and/or disallowance of administrative funds is being considered. After a State agency receives a warning, FNS may either suspend or disallow administrative funds or take both Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations actions in sequence, depending on the statement in the warning. (b) Suspension. A suspension of funds is an action by FNS to temporarily withhold all or a portion of the Federal share of one or more of the cost categories of a State agency's budget for administration of the Food Stamp Program. Suspensions of funds shall remain in effect until FNS determines that a State agency has taken adequate corrective action to correct the problem causing the suspension, in which event the suspension will be rescinded, or until FNS decides to disallow the suspended funds. FNS shall suspend funds in accordance with \u00a7 277.16. (c) Disallowance. (1) A disallowance of funds is an action by FNS in which reimbursement is denied for otherwise reimbursable administrative costs claimed by a State agency in one or more of the cost categories of a State agency's budget for Program administration. (2) In accordance with \u00a7 277.16, FNS has the option of disallowing funds in another cost category, or all or a portion of the entire Letter of Credit if the disallowance is based on a finding that the State agency failed to take a required action. FNS may disallow funds after previously suspending such funds or may disallow funds immediately following the expiration of the formal warning under the conditions specified in paragraph (e) of this section. (d) Warningprocess. Prior to taking action to suspend or disallow Federal fuids, except those funds which are disallowed when a State agency fails to adhere to the cost principles of Part 277 and Appendix \"A\", FNS shall provide State agencies with written advance notification that such action is being considered. If a State agency does not respond to such an advance notification to the satisfaction of FNS, FNS shall provide the State agency with a formal warning of the possibility of suspension or disallowance action. However, when a State agency fails to meet the objectives in an FNS-approved corrective action plan, FNS may omit the advance notification and immediately issue a formal warning. (1) Advance notification. Immediately upon becoming aware that a deficiency or deficiencies in a State agency's administration of the Program may warrant the suspension and/or disallowance of Federal funds, FNS shall advise the State agency in writing of the deficiency and shall provide a specific period of time for correction of such deficiency or deficiencies. The time period allowed the State agency for corrective action will vary according to the nature of the deficiency.(2) Formal warning. FNS shall issue a formal warning to a State agency if the State fails to correct to the satisfaction of FNS the deficiencies noted in an advance notification within the time specified in the advance notification. FNS may also issue a formal warning to a State agency without rst issuing an advance notification if a State agency fails to comply with an FNS-approved corrective action plan. (i) Formal warnings shall include the following information: (A) Specific descriptions of the deficiencies, explaining how the State agency is out of compliance with Program requirements; (B) A Statement as to whether Federal funds will be suspended, disallowed or both, if appropriate; (C] The amount of Federal funds that will be suspended and/or disallowed or an estimate of the amount if actual cost are unavailable; and (D) A statement of FNS' willingness to assist State agencies is resolving the deficiencies. (ii) A State agency shall have 30 days from receipt of a formal warning to submit evidence that it is in compliance or to submit a corrective action proposal, including the date the State agency will be in compliance. (iii) When the deficiency cannot be corrected within 30 dyes of receipt of a formal warning but the State agency submits an acceptable plan for correcting the deficiency, FNS shall hold the formal warning in abeyance pending completion of the actions contained in *the plan within the time specified in the plan. (iv) FNS shall cancel a formal warning when the State agency submits evidence that shows, to the satisfaction of FNS, that the deficiency has been eliminated. (e) Suspension/disallowance of funds. The Administrator of FNS shall notify State agencies in writing by certified mail or through personal service that administrative funds are being suspended or disallowed. Such action may occur when any of the following situations arise: (1) A State agency fails to respond to the deficiencies cited in a formal warning within 30 days of receiving the warning; (2) The response by a State agency to the deficiencies cited in a formal warning is unsatisfactory to FNS; or (3) A State agency fails to meet the commitments it made in its corrective action proposal and a formal warning had been held in abeyance pending completion of that corrective action. (f) Appeals. After FNS has taken action to disallow Federal funds the State agency may request an appeal inaccordance with the procedures specified in \u00a7 276.7. \u00a7 276.5 InjunctIve relief. (a) General. If FNS determines that a State agency has failed to comply with the Food Stamp Act, the regulations issued pursuant to the Act. or the FNS- approved State Plan of Operations, the Secretary may seek injunctive relief against the State agency to require compliance. The Secretary may request injunctive relief concurrently with negligence billings and sanctions against State agencies affecting administrative funds. (b) Requesting injunctive relief. Prior to seeking injunctive relief to require compliance, FNS shall notify the State agency of the determination of noncbmpliance and provide the State agency with a specific period of time to correct the deficiency. The Secretary shall have the discretion to determine the time periods State agencies will have to correct deficiencies. If the State agency does not correct the failure within the specified time period and the Department decides to seek injunctive relief, the Secretary shall refer the matter to the Attorney General with a request that injunctive relief be-sought to require compliance. \u00a7 276.6 Good cause. (a) When a State agency has failed to comply with provisions of the Act, the regulations issued pursuant to the Act, or the FNS-approved State Plan of Operation, and, thus, is subject to the suspension/disallowance and injunctive relief provisions in \u00a7\u00a7 276.4 and 276.5, FNS may determine that the State had good cause for the noncompliance. FNS shall evaluate good cause in these situations on a case-by-case basis, based on any one of the following criteria: (1) Natural disasters or civil disorders that adversely affect Program operations; (2) Strikes by State agency staff; (3) Change in the Food Stamp Program or other Federal or State programs that result in a substantial adverse impact upon a State agency's management of the Program; and (4) Any other circumstances in which FNS determines good cause to exist. (b) If FNS determines that food cause existed for a State agency's failure to comply with required provisions and standards, FNS shall not suspend or dijallow administrative funds nor seek injunctive relief to compel compliance with the provisions and standards.77265 77266 -Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Rules and Regulations \u00a7 276.7 Administrative reviewprocess.

ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This notice proposes a portion of the Agency's standards for development of certain data on physical and chemical characteristics of substances for which EPA will require testing under section 4(a) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (Pub. L. 94-469; 90 Stat. 2006; 15 U.S.C. 2603). These standards will be incorporated into future TSCA section 4 rules that will 'designate particular.cIfemicals for testing. When EPA requires testing on specific chemicals, the person performing the test will be required to conform to the methods and conditions in these standards with such modifications as may be appropriate for the specific chemical. The Agency will use the data geneiatbd by such testing to aid in assessing whether chemicals present unreasonable risks. EPA is proposing here preliminary standards for testing density/relative density, melting temperature, vapor prdssure, octanol/water partition coefficient, and soil thin layer chromatography. DATES: Written comments should be submitted on or before January 21, 1981. Oral comments will be received on February 10, 1981. See Supplementary Information for public meeting information.

Introduction Support documents which provide the scientific and technical bases for the test standards proposed in this package are available upon request from the Industry Assistance Office (TS-799), Office of Pesticides and Toxic Substances, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. E--427, 401 M! Street, SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. The support documents, when read together with this preamble, will provide an explanation oi the bases for these standards. 'EPA proposed under section 4 of the Toxic Substances Control Act, (TSCA)(Pub. L. 94-469; 90 Stat. 2006; 15 U.S.C. 2603) standards for the development of data on chronic health effects published in the Federal Register of May 9, 1979 (44 FR 27334 et seq.). With the proposal, EPA began the process of codifying healthf effects standards for incorporation into future TSCA section 4 test rules. EPA proposed standards for testing chemicals for acute and subchronic toxicity, mutagenic effects, teratogenic effects, reproductive effects, and standards for metabolism studies published in the Federal Register on July- 26, 1979 (44 FR 44054). Today EPA is co-fifnuing the process of codifying test standards by proposing the first environmental testing standards. In the future, the Agency will propose chemicals to be tested in accordance with section 4 test standards. In the present rulemaking to codify test standards, the issues center on the suitability of the proposed generic standards for testing chemicals under' these future section 4 test rules. In rulemakings to require the testing of specific chemicals or categories of chemicals, the issues will center on the need to test the identified chemicals, and the appropriateness of any needed -modifications to those generic standards when applied to particular chemicals. In the future EPA will be proposing additional test standards for neurobehavioral toxicity, other physical, chemical, and environmental persistence characteristics, and various ecological effects. In addition, EPA has proposed a set of Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) for use with test standards on human health effects (44 FR 27334), and in a separate proposal in this issue of the Federal Register EPA is proposing a GLP for use-with test standards on ecological effects and on chemical, physical, and environmental persistence characteristics. The Agency's goal is to promulgate - test standards for every important environmental effect and for the physical, chemical, and persistencecharacteristics which can be used in judging the environmental fate of a chemical. The Agency does not Intend to require the use of all or even necessarily a significant fraction of the available test standards in a given test rule that requires testing of a specific chemical, Testing requirements will only be applied to a specific chemical if the Agency finds such testing is necessary in accordance with section 4 of the Act. When EPA determines that chemical substances satisfy the testing prerequisites in section 4(a), these chemical substances will be joined In section 4(a) test rules with standards finalized as a result of today's proposal, or with revisions or modifications of these standards, as necessary and appropriate. EPA's legal authority to require testing of chemical substances in accordance with test standards and the use of test data for assessing the risk potential of toxic substances are set forth in the document proposing Chronic Health Effects Standards published in the Federal Register of May 9, 1979 (44 FR 27335). II. Major Issues Several informal comments received by EPA in response to earlier drafts of these standards and some written and oral comments on published proposed standards for testing for health effects have raised two major questions: (1) Why is EPA issuing \"generic\" test standards rather than preparing and proposing test standards as part of each rule? (2) Why are TSCA proposed test standards generally more detailed and specific than standards or guidelines used by other agencies or used by EPA in other programs? The following discussion explains EPA's reason for the use of generic standards and for preparing test standards with a relatively high degree of specificity. \"Generic\" Standards As explained in other places in this proposal, EPA is developing test standards for application in section 4 testing rules. Steps in the process are: 1. EPA prepares proposed test standards and publishes them for public comment. 2. EPA revises the standards,, considering comments received, and issues the standards as rules published in the Code of Federal Regulations, 3. When the Agency proposes rules that require testing of individual chemicals, the proposed rule will incorporate test standards as appropriate. In the proposed rule, the77332 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1960 / Proposed Rules Agency may modify the standards as needed because of characteristics peculiar to the chemicals addressed by the rule. During the public comment period on each test rule, the issues for comment will focus on the appropriateness of testing the chemical and the need to modify the standards based on specific chemical characteristics. 4. In chemical-specific test rules, the Agency normally will not modify the basic standards except as applied to individual chemicals. At regular intervals, but at least once each year as required by TSCA, EPA reviews all test standards and proposes modifications as necessary. The alternative would be for EPA to create new standards for testing in each test rule. Thereby, as each proposed testing rule is issued, all details of the testing standards for each prescribed test would be included with the proposed rule. Each aspect of each test standard also would be open for. detailed comment as part of the commenting on the proposed rule. EPA's reasons for developing standards separately are: (1) Section 4 of TSCA requires that EPA assure that testing of chemicals produces data that are \"reliable and adequate\". This means, for example, that the methods prescribed must be reviewed and validated. Since testing conditions may be chemical specific, it simply is neither practical nor efficient for EPA to validate testing methods for each rule; it is necessary to have a basic set of validated and accepted generic standards which have received reviews and acceptance that can be applied as the rules demand, with modifications as necessary for particular chemicals. (2] EPA must have an orderly process for annual review of standards. Section 4(b](2)(B] of TSCA mandates that standards for testing be reviewed at least every 12 months. EPA plans to conduct these reviews through two processes: (a] A review of existing standards by its own scientists and invited scientists from outside the Agency. (b] Solicitation of comments from all interested parties through public announcement of an open period of consideration of review. In order for such an orderly review process to work, it is necessary for EPA to have specific objects of review in the form of uniform standards for testing that are used in the many different rules. Again, it is not practical and would be extremely difficult to review a set of standards if the standards were scattered among a host of differing rules,with differences in the standards from rule to rule. (3) EPA is obligated to develop testing standards that are, to the extent practicable, consistent with standards of other agencies, with standards of other EPA programs, and with accepted international standards for testing of chemicals. In most cases these are generic standards and do not apply to specific chemicals or chemical groups. Standards for TSCA testing will of course differ in many ways in order to meet the specific requirements of the Agency for assessing risk of chemicals under TSCA. So-called \"generic\" standards allow EPA a practical basis for examining the standards of other organizations and programs, judging their suitability for application to TSCA testing, making modifications as necessary, securing comment. conducting regular reviews of the changes in the state-of-the-art and the standards developed by others, and incorporating the changes in TSCA standards. (4) EPA wants to encourage manufacturers to test chemicals on their own initiative. EPA feels that a set of acceptable standards for conducting tests provides manufacturers with a good set of guidance as to the standards of data that they should seek to achieve in their own testing programs. Specificity Section 3(12)(B) of TSCA states that\"standards for the development of test data\" means, to the extent necessary, a prescription to assure that data respecting such effects and characteristics are reliable and adequate: (i) The manner in which such data are to be developed. (ii)}The specification of any test protocol or methodology to be employed in the development of such data. (iii) Such other requirements as are necessary to provide such assurance. There are many aspects to EPA's requirements for reliable and adequate data: (1) EPA must be able to judge the accuracy and precision of the data. By use of a relatively small number of mithods that have been validated and standardized, EPA is able to compile information on the accuracy and precision of prescribed tests. If EPA were to allow great freedom in the selection or alteration of testing methods, it would be necessary to require each tester to submit data on validation, precision, and accuracy with each set of data. (2] EPAmust be able to prescribe that certain data fail within specified levelsof accuracy. Examples are data that EPA uses in certain models predicting environmental fate, exposure, or toxicity to certain parts of the environment. The most practical way to prescribe accuracy is to specify standardized techniques which have been validated as being capable of meeting the accuracy requirements which the Agency needs. (3) Certain types of testing data are used In risk analyses which require data that are highly comparable to use in interpolation. extrapolation, or evaluation of surrogates. EPA. for example, uses toxicity or reproductive tests on a few species of aquatic plants and animals to judge whether or not chemicals have effects on the overall aquatic environment. The test species have been carefully selected and the testing schemes have been made highly specific in order for EPA to make broad analyses of environmental impact based on the results of a few tests. Without the strict standards on the few types of tests which EPA uses as surrogates, it would be necessary for the Agency to require a much larger group of tests. (4) It is necessary to prepare testing standards for dealing with the least experienced laboratories. Although many laboratories have highly experienced scientific staffs and facilities and normally conduct chemical tests in professional, reliable manners, there are others who do not. In the cases of the best laboratories it would probably be possible to expect adequate and reliable data based only on general guidance for testing methodology. But with the less experienced laboratories, the staff are not able to make adequate judgments as to which specific testing standard to apply and where the standards may or may not be altered without adversely affecting the results. EPA, therefore, feels that it must write standards that are specific so as to provide adequate guidance to the least experienced testing laboratories as to which specific techniques must be used and which portions of the testing protocols may or may not be modified. In order to meet the four requirements stated above, and others, and to assure comparability of data among chemicals and laboratories it is necessary to limit many of the discretionary variations which are often permitted in testing protocols. For these reasons, the standards for TSCA section 4 testing specify detailed instructions to assure that reliable data are developed to satisfy the needs of EPA for good information to conduct chemical risk assessments. In spite of the specificity, these standards are general in several77333 Federal Register./ Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules respects, and where necessary, more specific requirements or modifications related to the chemical substance(s) to be tested may be proposed in specific chemical test rules. See Good Laboratory Practice Standards for Health Effects (44 FR. 27362) for a discussion of the problem of unreliable test data. II. Basis and Purpose of Physical; Chemical, and Environmental Persistence Test Standards General ' Testing of physical, chemical, and. environmental persistence characteristics will be required as part of a test rule in those cases were the Agency determines that data from such testing are necessary to evaluate the environmental fate or other pertinent - characteristics of a chemical. Assessment of the fate of a chemical substance after its release into the environment often is essential for the evaluation of exposure and risks posed by that chemical. Fate, in this sense, is defined as the transport and1 transformation of a chemical by natural means after it is released to the environment from a point source,'e.g., a manufacturing plant or waste treatment plant, a disposal site such as a landfill, or a dispersive use. Determination of the fate of a chemical substance in the environment may involve investigation of the nature of dispersal and ultimate distribution, and of the types and-rates of reactions in which the chemical participates during transport, Fate determinations help to identify the chemical form(s), the environmental compartments or concentration ranges to which the environment will be exposed, and the organisms exposed to the chemical. Chemical Transport Chemicals -discharged into the environment are generally released into one or more of four media: air, water, soil, and sediment. Discharged materials often do not reside long in one medium but are transported to other medfa by processes that depend upon the characteristics of the region into which they are released, e.g, meterological conditions, the flow of surface waters, the location and flow of groundwaters, tidal action, topographic characteristics, and the characteristics of soils, sediments, and suspended particulates, and on certain physical and chemical characteristics of the substance itself. An analysis'of the transport of discharged chemicals is further complicated because receiving and transporting media can be divided into avariety of subtypes. For example, water can be fresh, saline, estuarine, undergound, or free-flowing in streams, or ponded in lakes. Similarly, soils may vary in structure, composition, and chemical properties. Several methods are available for helping to determine the tendency of a chemical to become distributed into one or more environmental media following its release, i.e., its partitioning potential. One of these methods is direct field measurement or'monitoring. A very small portion of all chemicals, however, has been the object of field study or monitoring programs and, therefore, existing monitoring data usually are not available for adequately determining partitioning potential. In addition, monitoring is expensive and generally requires a considerable amount of time to accomplish. Most determinations of chemical transport must therefore depend, at least in part, on analyses of several important chemical and physical characteristics, such as: (1) density; (2) melting and boiling temperatures; (3) octanol/water partition coefficients; (4) solubility in water;, (5) vapor pressure; (6) adsorption/desorption on particulate surfaces; (7) particle size distribution for insoluble solids; (8) dissociation constants in water for substances which dissociate in water;, and (9) ultraviolet and visible absorption spectra. The test standards proposed in this - Federal Register notice are detailed descriptions of methods for measuring several of the characteristics mentioned above. They have been -valuated by EPA and have been found suitable for developing good and reliable data as required under section of TSCA. Some of the methods have been selected from those adopted by standardizing organizations; but others have been developed by or for.EPA, or adopted' from other sources as the needs of EPA dictated. Chemical Persistence Chemical persistence can be defined as the ability of a chemical to retain-its molecular integrity, and its physical, chemical, and functional characteristics in the environment through which iFis transported and distributed following its environmental release. The inverse of chemical persiftence is chemical degradability or transformation, which can be brought about through physical, biological, chemical, and photochemial mechanisms. The susceptibility or resistance of a chemical to degradation will determine, to a large extent, its residence time in a particular medium, environmental comiiartment, or ecosystem. Persistence is a major factor in determining thesteady-state concentration that a chemical may attain in a particular medium or in a compartment thereof, i.e., its residence time. Thus, If the rate of.degradation in a medium or environmental compartment exceeds Its rate of entry, there is less likelihood of its achieving significant environmental concentration levels in that medium or. compartment. However, there could still be cause for concern if the rate of uptake by biota in those areas exceeded the rate of chemical degradation, or If dispersion or transport were poor so that the chemical tended to concentrate in small \"hot spots,\" areas of relatively high concentrations of a chemical, Data on chemical persistence and on chemical transport can assist In making pretesting decisions such as the selection of species to test for chemical effects. Thus, if data on persistence and transport showed that it is likely that a chemical will concentrate or persist in a particula: environment, it might be logical to test for effects on a wide v~iriety of species residing in that environment. As stated above, degradation of chemical substances can take place by physical, biological, chemical, and photochemical mechanisms. The test standards found in Subpart L describe what EPA believes are some of the best\"screening\" tests for assessing potential degradability by each mechanism. As EPA and the scientific community develop more sophisticated test mechanisms, EPA's test standards for measuring chemical persistence will address the following: (1) biodegradation-aerobic and anaerobic, (2) photochemical (3) cheinical degradation-hydrolytic, reductive, and oxidative. General Criteria for Test Selection Test methods described in Subpart L are selected on the basis of several criteria. First, the selected methods must be capable of providing information precise enough for use in risk assessments. Selected methods also must be cost effective and be recognized by the scientific community as part of the state-of-the-art technology. Exceptions may be made when intensive surveys of the literature indicate that there are deficiencies in the state-0f-the- art, such as with tests that do not answer the important questions, are poorly validated, or are inadequately described. When this occurs, hybrid tests incorporating the best features of several methods will be constructed for interim use pending the development of better methodologies and validation of77334 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules the hybrids themselves. Where problems of this type have been identified, EPA is vigorously seeking solutions through development of new tests or validation of recently developed tests that are not yet widely accepted. IV. Scientific Policy Considerations General The major question which applies to all types of tests which generate data to be used in predicting environmental effects and the fate of chemical substances is the validity of using laboratory results to make predictions of chemical behavior in the \"real world\". Extrapolation of the results of controlled laboratory tests to predictions of the environmental behavior of chemicals is accepted practice. The alternative of testing in the environment itself is often impractical for a number of reasons. The environment is a heterogeneous entity with endless variations. ThereforT, direct testing in the environment i usually limited to cases in which the specific area of chemical release is known and there is adequate assurance that the chemical would be fully contained within the proscribed area. In the absence of these conditions, field testing is often economically prohibitive and could be hazardous if chemicals of unknown toxicity were to be applied to the environment. Since it is impossible to simulate all environments, generic testing standards must address a representative set of relevant environmental variables, chosen to be economically and technically practical. The Agency specifically solicits conuiient from interested parties on the adequacy with which this objective would be met by the proposed standards. Relationship to EPA Pesticide Registration Guidelines EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs has proposed testing guidelines under the Federal Insecticide. Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended (FIFRA) (86 Stat. 973; 89 Stat. 751; 7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.) which contain data requirements comparable to those proposed by these standards published in the Federal Register of August 22,1978 (43 FR 37336). In addition, EPA and other Federal agencies may issue regulations under other statutory authorities which would impose requirements similar to those in these standards. The Agency's policy is to reduce the burden on the regulated public which might arise from conflicting requirements tinder these different sets of regulations and guidelines.Proposed test standards to meet TSCA and FIFRA requirements differ to some extent because of the Agency's need to evaluate a greater variety of chemicals and exposure situations under TSCA, and the continuing evolution of technology. For example, chemicals registered under FIFRA are known biocides and have been developed for their intentional release and destructive effects on various types of organisms. On the other hand, under TSCA, the Agency must evaluate the effects of a variety of chemicals whose harmful effects and exposure routes may or may not be known. It is logical, therefore, that EPA may take different approaches to testing these two classes of materials. The final \"iCA test standards and final FIFRA guidelines will be consistent to the extent practical. In this proposal, the major differences are that TSCA test standards include broader ranges of testing techniques within each test standard as a result of the greater variety of chemicals which may be subjected to testing under TSCA. Also, the TSCA test standards provide instructions to the tester on the selection of an appropriate technique from among those cited in the standard whereas the FIFRA guidelines do not. A more specific discussion of the differences between individual TSCA and FIFRA standards appears in the support document of each proposed TSCA test standard. Relationship to Interagency and International Test Guidelines EPA is participating in two major efforts to develop multiagency agreement on test methods-one interagency and one international. EPA has joined with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA of DHHS), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA of DOL) and the Food Quality and Safety Service (FQSS of USDA), to form the Interagency Regulatory Liaison Group (IRLG). The general purpose of the IRLG is to coordinate the regulatory activities of the five member agencies. One IRLG committee, in which EPA participates, is developing testing guidelines for human health and environmental effects. The guidelines so developed are intended to yield data acceptable to all five agencies. When proposed IRLG testing guidelines are completed, EPA will review and revise its test standards to be consistent with IRLG guidelines, to the extent that EPA's statutory responsibilities will permit. EPA also is working with the IRLG and other agencies in the developmentof schemes for standardized reporting formats and improved recordkeeping and reporting. The present plan is for IRLG to announce the availability of its reporting formats as it announces the availability of its standards. To the extent practical, EPA will adopt the same reporting formats for use in reporting data from the tests outlined in these standards. In developing chemical testing and other activities under TSCA, EPA has been afull and regular partner in extensive international consultations and activities, especially through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The Agency places high priority on these international activities and will attempt to achieve an international harmonizing of chemical testing requirements. A principal objective is to reduce the burden on the international chemical industry which might be caused by unnecessarily vague or inconsistent requirements. To the extent practical under laws of the several countries, the objective is to provide that data developed to meet one country's requirements are acceptable to another. Comments from other countries and international organizations will be solicited and given serious consideration as the Agency develops these and other regulations. Agreement reached through the international activities in which the EPA is engaged will be considered in EPA development of regulations subject to the strictures of the Agency rulemaking process. Future Environmental Test Standards The Agency intends to promulgate test standards which can be applied selectively, as necessary, to obtain data on all factors which need-to be known to assess a chemical's environmental effects and fate. The standards proposed here are only part of a group of tests needed to characterize chemicals and that group, in turn, is a subset of a broader category of test standards on physical, chemical, and environmental persistence characteristics. Over the next several months the Agency also will be proposing a full range of test standards for ecological effects, ranging from simple, short-term acute toxicity tests to more complex life- cycle testing, and covering organisms found in the major compartments of both the aquatic and terrestrial environments. The Agency currently is involved in a major research effort to develop and validate additional testing methodologies at both ends of the spectrum of complexity. A number of protocols designed to provide rapid.77335 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules inexpensive screening of chemicals for ecological effects are being investigated currently. The Agency also is pursuing complex testing systems which enable quantification of effects above the population level of ecological organization. V. Economic Analysis, The economic analysis of test standards has two major parts.-The first part involves analyzing the cost of the individual tests outlined in the standards, or the cost of the protocols associated with these standards. The, second part will occur when these test standards arereferenced in test rules for specific chemicals and chemical groups. The second analysis will consider the, potential economic impact of these costs on the parties involved, e.g., manufacturers and/or processors. Economic analyses for the standards proposed here are included in the: * support documents andin a report by Enviro Control, Inc., which is part of the public record for this rulemaking. The analyses cover only the costs of the procedures associated with these standards. The estimates were prepared from a survey of commercial laboratories, and by separating the protocol into components and estimating the cost of each component, inclding direct labor cost, bverhead cost, other direct costs, general and administrative costs, and profit or fee. Estimates of the costs of the five tests proposed here are: 1. For density/relative density the range is $13 to $109 per test. 2. For melting temperature the range is $25 to $125 per test. 3. For vapor pressure the range is $64 to $ 595 per test, depending on the characteristics of the chemical and the, protocol used. There may be additional' costs of up to approximately $1,000 for chemical analyses, again depending on the type of material being tested. 4. For octanol/water partition coefficient the range is $100 to $1,400 per test, which may be reduced significantly if several tests are run at once. There may be additional costs of chemical analyses-which will not exceed$1,000 per sample for most materials. - 5. For soil thin-layer chromatography the range is $1V2 to $850 per test. For some chemicals there may be additional costs of chemical analyses which will not exceed $1,000 per sample for most materials. All of the above cost estimates assume that the proposed Good Laboratory Practice Standards apply to the testing. When the Agency applies these test standards to test rules for specific chemicals and chemical groups, it will analyze the potential economic impactof these test rules on the parties subject to the rules. This analysis will consider the market, financial, and economic conditions of the chemicals involved, either as individual chemicals or as members of a group. It will consider the impact of the test costs on production, by considering such items as price changes, demand elasticities, and the availability of substitutes, and it will consider the ability of the ,income from a chemical to support testing required. The economic impact analysis of the combination of tests will be presented in * support documents when the test rules are proposed; they will be subjected to public comment, and revised if needed. Economic factors relating to individual tests will be considered in developing all test rules. VI. Public Meetings EPA persoinel responsible for developing these proposed Environmental Test Standards will be available to meet with interested persons from companies, trade, associations, organized labor and citizen organizations on February 10, 1981 at: Skyline Inn, South Capitol & I Streets, SW., Washington,.D.C.. The meeting will be from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. This location is three blocks east of the EPA Headquarters, Waterside Mall, 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. - Persons who wish to make presentations should request time by contacting the Industry Assistance Office by telephone, either toll free (800-424-9065] or on 554-- 1404 in Washington. Time will be scheduled between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. The Agency will make a transcript of the sessions for inclusion in the official public record. Participation in a session will be limited to those who have requested that time to make oral comment. One purpose of providing this opportunity for-oral comment is to provide EPA with information on costs and approaches to compliance for impacted companies, especially small ones. The other purpose of this public meeting is to allow EPA to digest the scope and nature of-written comments on scientific and'technical points before hearing oral argument or comment on them. The Agency's general criterion for alloting time will be that a person has an interpretation, data or experience that is best presented orally with the opportunity for-cross-checking communication with the Agency. In this. case, an additional criterion will be that aperson-has a review of the written commentary already submittedto share with the Agency. EPA's experience has shown that this roundtable formatfor, public meetings by request that are opento the public yields more productive exchanges for both commentators and the Agency. EPA encourages commentators to use the toll free telephone to ask questions of clarification early in the written comment period to aid their formulating their comments. VII.

During the rulemaking proceeding, interested peasons should notify EPA ofI1! 77336 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules additions they believe should be made to the record. EPA particularly encourages this notification during the early part of the comment period. VIII. Proposed Test Standards The following introductory material applies to the five specific test standards included in this proposal: Density/Relative Density The density of a substance influences movement of a chemical in the environment. Solids and liquids will float or sink in water depending on their density, and lightweight granular materials will be more easily transported in the air than will heavy materials. Tests for determining density are inexpensive and most testing laboratories will be able to run the tests with at least the accuracy required by EPA. The test standard requires sponsors to determine density or density relative to water or air (relative density) at ambient temperature. It is written in a general way, to permit the selection of a technique appropriate to the particular chemical from a variety of available techniques. These techniques were selected on the basis of their relatively low cost and acceptability by the scientific community as outlined in the support document. A theoretical calculation of density is specified for gaseous materials, but the measurement of real gas density is permitted as an option. Factors that influence the selection of a technique for a liquid test material include volatility and viscosity. Factors that influence the selection of a technique for a solid test material include particle size, wetability by possi'ble immersion liquids, and solubility in possible immersion liquids. The test is to be performed at standard reference temperatures. Melting Temperature The melting temperature describes whether a chemical substance or mixture will be solid or fluid under ambient pressure. This information will allow the Agency to determine the form in which the chemical will be found when in the environment. The form is important because it determines whether the chemical will stand in place or flow away from spills, stockpiles, or places of use or disposal. When combined with density information and solubility information it determines how the chemical will move in a waterway; when combined with other information such as volatility and particle size, it determines the distribution and dispersal of the material.Melting temperature is the temperature at which the change from solid to liquid takes place. In practice many materials, particularly those that are mixtures or form glasses, do not melt sharply at a well defined temperature, but rather soften and liquify over a range of temperatures. For these materials other terms are used, including pour point, congealing temperature, initial and final melting temperature, or melting range. In addition, impurities influence the melting temperature, sometimes by many degrees. The proposed test standard would require sponsors to determine melting temperature of the test chemical or the range of temperature over which it melts, within the range from -30\"C to +250\"C. Ambient temperatures in the United States rarely go below -30C in the winter and above 43\"C in the summer. Higher temperatures, such as are caused by the sun shining on dark surfaces or by heated apparatus, give an upper limit of interest of 250\"C. Most environmental surfaces are below this temperature at all times and even heated apparatus cools below this temperature within minutes after being turned off. The standard is written to permit selection of an appropriate technique from a spectrum of techniques selected on the basis of their relatively low cost and acceptability to the scientific community as outlined in the support document. Vapor Pressure The vapor pressure of a chemical affects the tendency of a substance to volatilize, and therefore is important in determining the environmental fate of the chemical. Volatilization is the loss of a substance from a surface or from solution by evaporation, and volatilization from land and water surfaces is the most important source of material for airborne transport. Volatilization is probably the single largest means by which pesticides are lost and transported over wide areas and into bodies of water far from the application location. The airborne vapors of a hazardous chemical may present a threat to humans and other life exposed to those vapors, not only in the areas of chemical release but also at sites remote from the volatilization site. This occurs when vapors are removed from the air, primarily by precipitation with rain or snow. There are several procedures for the measurement of vapor pressure. These include static procedures, boiling point procedures, methods of vapor transfer by a current of inert gas (\"gas saturation\" or \"transpiration\"techniques), evaporation from an open surface, and effusion procedures. There are also many specialized techniques that have been used for very precise vapor pressure determinations of specific kinds of materials or for micro and semimicro determinations. A procedure for measuring the vapor pressure of materials released to the environment ideally would cover a wide range of vapor pressure values, at ambient temperatures. No single procedure can cover this range, so two different procedures are described in this test standard, each suited for a different part of the range. The isoteniscope procedure is for pure liquids with vapor pressures from 0.1 to 100 kPa. For vapor pressure of 10- to103 Pa, a gas saturation procedure is to be used. The isoteniscope procedure usesa standardized technique that was developed to measure the vapor pressure of certain liquid hydrocarbons. The sample is purified within the equipment by removing dissolved and entrained gases until the measured vapor pressure is constant, a process called \"degassing.\" Impurities more volatile than the sample will tend to increase the observed vapor pressure. Results are subject to only slight error for samples containing non-volatileimpurities. The gas saturation procedures described utilize relatively simple equipment. Results are easy to obtain and can be quite precise. The same procedures also can be used to study volatilization from laboratory-scale environmental simulations. OctanollWaterPartiton Coefficient The tendency of an organic chemical to bioconcentrate in living cells can be inferred from the value of the octanol/ water partition coefficient, K,. Chemicals with K,,, less than 10 will not significantly partition into, or tend to accumulate in, living cells. Chemicals with K., greater than lOwill tend to accumulate. Chemicals that exist in the environment at subtoxic levels may bioconcentrate to toxic levels once inside organisms. This test standard describes a detailed and commonly used procedure for determination of the octanollwater partition coefficient K., for organic chemicals. The method determines the distribution of the chemical between octanol and water after equilibration. Values of K., can then be calculated from the resulting data. The test standard is designed to determine the octanol/water partition coefficient of the test chemical in the range 10 to 10. For chemicals whose values lie outside77337 Federal Register /\" Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules this range, K.. should be characterized as less than 10 or greater than 106 with no further quantification. Other methods for determining or estimating partition coefficients such as reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography were rejected for reasons presented in the support document. Soil Thin-Layer Chromatqgraphy Soil thin-layer chromatography (TLC). is a qualitative screening method for estimating a chemical's leaching potential. Leaching of chemicals through soil is an important process which determines if a chemical will reach the ground water or remain at or near the soil surface. If a chemical reaches groundwater or remains at the soil surface, deleterious environmental and human health effects may arise due to plant and animal uptake and throughthe contamination of food and water supply. This test was selected over the soil isotherm and-soil column methods since it is the least expensive and most widely used technique for the screening of a chemical's leaching potential. - General Statement on Hazardous Solvents Several of the tests contained in this standard require the use of solvents which are known or suspected to be hazardous. In a few cases the solvents are specified, e.g., benzene, and in other cases, where the tests specify a \"solvent of choice,\" it is expected that benzene, or toluene, or other similar materials may be selected. The Good Laboratory Practice Standards and other procedural specifications warn testing laboratories that such known or suspected hazardous materials should be used in these tests only in strict accordance with protective measures that will safeguard the laboratory personnel performing the tests. Note.-Under Executive Order 12o44, EPA' is required to judge whether a regulation is\"significant\" and therefore subject to the procedural requirements of the order or whether it may follow other specialized development procedures. EPA labels these other regulations \"specialized.\" This regulation has been reviewed and it has been determined that it is a specialized regulation not subject to the-procedural requirements of Executive Order 12044. (Sec. 4, Toxic Substances Control (TSCA), (90 Stat 2006 (15 U.S.C. 2603))) Dated: September 25,-1980. Douglas M. Costle,_ .Administrator. Therefore, it is proposed that 40 CFR Part 772 be amended by adding a new Subpart L to read as follows:Subpart L-Physical, Chemical, and Environmental Persistence Cheracterlstics Sec. 772.122-1 density. (a) Purpose. This standard will develop data on density and relative density (specific gravity) of chemical substances and mixtures. EPA will use the data on density to evaluate the manner and extent that chemicals will be transported in the environment and the places where they will be deposited. (b) Definitions. (1) \"Apparent density\" is the weight in air of a unit volume of a material. It differs from the density in thdt the buoyancy correction has not been applied, and normal gravity is assumed. (2) \"Apparent relative density\" differs from the relative density in that the buoyancy corrections for the mhterials and the reference material have not been applied. For this test apparent relative density will be accepted as relative density. (3) \"Bulk density\" of a material is the mass of material in a container divided by the volume of the container. In a loosely packed granular or powdery solid, a substantial fraction of the total space is occupied by gas that fills the interstices, and therefore bulk density is substantially less than the particle densityw This test standard does not determine bulk density, it determines the particle which is the true density of the material. (4) \"Density\" is the mass of a unit volume of a material. It is a function of temperature, hence the temperature at which it is measured should be specified. For a solid, it is the density of the impermeable portion rather than the bulk density.- (5) \"Relative density\" (\"specific gravity\") is the ratio of the density of a material to that of a reference material, each measured under specified conditions of temperature and pressure. For liquids the reference material is gas- free distilled water, for gases, it is dry air of normal carbon dioxide content. (c) Good laboratorypractice. The - Good Laboratory Practice Standards for Physical, Chemical, Persistence, and Ecological Effects Testing in \u00a7 772.110-2 must be followed in performing this standard. (d) Conditions-1) Apparatus. The apparatus used for experimental tests must be of a type appropriate for the measurement technique being used, andmust meet the folloving specific standards: Thermometers must conform to specifications as specified in the standard density measuremeit technique selectedi and shall have a calibration traceable to the National Bureau of Standards.

The following materials must be available: (I) Density reference substances as required by the technique, for calibrating the density-measurement apparatus and for comparative density measurements, selected from or in addition to the following list, and prepared according to the recommendation of the technique used in Table 1 under paragraph (e)(1)() of this section: gas-free distilled or demineralized water, mercury, standardized glass, cyclohexane, or toluene. (ii) Comparison gases, as required by the technique, for relative density measurements of gases, or for displacement by solids. Suggested comparison gases are helium or dry air. (ii) Immersion liquids as required by the technique and by the substance to be tested, Suggested immersion liquids cyclohexane, or isopropyl salicylate. (3) Temperature of test (I) The density or relative density of the material must be determined at 25\u00b0C (298.15 K), except as allowed in paragraph (d)(3)(i) or (ili), of this section. (ii) If the material is an industrial material of a class for which engineering standards for measurement have been set at 15\u00b0C, the density may be measured at 15\u00b0C (288.15 K). (iii) If the material belongs to a class of chemicals for which international measurement standards have been set at 20=C, the density may be determined at 20\u00b0C (293.15 K).

The standard in this subpart is designed to develop values of vapor pressure, at environmentally relevant temperatures, of chemical substances. The EPA will use the data to evaluate transport in the environment. (b) Definitions. (1) \"Desorption efficiency\" of a particular compound applied to a sorbent and subsequently extracted with a solvent is the weight of the compound which can be recovered from the sorbent divided by the weight of the compound originally sorbed. (2) \"Pascal\" (Pa) is an international unit of vapor pressure and is defined as newtons per square meter (N/m}. A Newton is the force necessary to give acceleration of one meter per second squared to one kilogram of mass. (3) The \"torr\" is a unit of pressure defined as equal to 133.3 pascals or 1 mn Hg at OC.(4) The \"vapor pressure\" is the pressure at which a liquid or solid is in equilibrium with its vapor at a given temperature. (5) \"Volatilization\" is the loss of a substance to the air from a surface or from solution by evaporation. (c) Good Joboratorypractice. The Good Laboratory Practice Standards for Physical, Chemical, Persistence, and Ecological Effects Testing, in \u00a7 772.110- 2. must be followed in performing this standard. (d) Conditions. (1) The apparatus used for the test procedures must be of a type appropriate for the measurements described in paragraphs (e) and (g) of this section. (2) The tests must be performed under conditions of normal laboratory room temperatures. (e) Procedures. The vapor pressure of compounds must be determined by one of the following procedures. (1) Isoteniscope procedure. The isoteniscope procedure described as ANSI/ASTM Method D 2879-75 is applicable for the measurement of vapor pressures of liquids with vapor pressures of 0.1 to 100 kilopascals (kPa) (0.75 to 750 torr). ANSI/ASTM D 2879- 75, \"Standard Test Method for Vapor Pressure-Temperature Relationships And Initial Decomposition Temperature of Liquids by Isoteniscope\", is incorporated by reference. It is for sale from the American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia Pa. 19103. It is also available for inspection at the Office of the Federal Register Information Center, Room 8301, 1100 L Street NW, Washington, D.C. 20408. The isoteniscope method involves placing a liquid sample in a thermostated bulb (the isoteniscope) connected to a manometer and a vacuum pump. Dissolved and entrained gases are removed from the sample in the isoteniscope by heating the sample at reduced pressure. The vapor pressure of the sample at selected temperatures is determined by balancing the pressure due to the vapor of the sample against a known pressure of an inert gas. The vapor pressure of the test compound must be determined in triplicate at 25 _0.5\"C and at any other temperatures (- 0.5') specified in a Test Rule. Additional vapor pressure measurements must be made at appropriate temperatures, as necessary, to assure that there is no need for further degassing, as described in the ASTM method. (2) Gas saturation procedure. The gas saturation procedure, described in paragraph (g) of this section. is applicable for solids and liquids with vapor pressures at ambient temperatures of 10- Pa to I kPa (7.5X10'- torr to 7.5 torr). (f) Reporting. (1) Report information required in \u00a7 772.110-2 (h) of Good Laboratory Practice Standards. (2) The triplicate calculated vapor pressures for the test material at each test temperature and the average calculated vapor pressure at each temperature must be reported. (3) A description of analytical methods used to analyze for the test material and all analytical results must be reported. (4) For the isoteniscope procedure, the plot of log p vs the reciprocal of the temperature in K developed during the degassing step and showing linearity in the region of 298.15 K (25*C and any other required test temperatures, must be included. (5) For the gas saturation procedure, the data must include calculations of vapor pressure at three or more gas flow rates at each test temperature, showing no dependence on flow rate. The data also must include a description of sorbents and solvents employed and the desorption efficiency calculations. (6) The average calculated vapor pressure at each temperature must include the calculated standard deviation. (7) A description of any difficulties experienced or any other pertinent information should be provided. (g) Gas saturation procedure for vapor pressure. The gas saturation procedure is based on methodology currently being developed by SRI International under contract to the Environmental Protection Agency EPA Contract No. 68-01-5117). (1) The test procedures require the use of a constant-temperature box as in the following Figure 1.77345 Federal Register / VoL 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules /FIGURE 1 -SCHEMATIC DIAGRAM OF VAPOR SATURATION APPARATUS Insulated box N2 Out to flow meter N2out The insulated box, containing sample holders, may be of any suitable size and shape. The sketch m Figure I shows a box containing three solid sample holders and three liquid sample holders, which allows for the triplicate analysis of either a solid or liquid sample. Temperatures within the box must be controllable to \u00b10.5\u00b0 or better. Nitrogen gas, split into six streams and controlled by fine needle valves (approximately 0.79 mm orifice), flows into the box via, 3.8mm (0.125 in.) .d. copper tubing. After temperature equilibration, the gas flows through the sample and the sorbent trap and exits from the box. The flow rate of the effluent carrier gas is measured at room temperature with a bubble meter or other suitable device. The flow rate must be checked frequently during the experiment to assure that there is an accurate value for the total volume of carrier gas. The flow rate is used to calculate the total volume room temperature) of gas that haspassed through the sample and sorbent (vol/time x time= volume). The vapor pressure of the test substance can be calculated from the total gas volume and the mass of sample vaporized. If v is the volume of gas that transported mass w of the vaporized test material having a molecular weight M, and if p is the equilibrium vapor pressure of the sample at temperatureT, then p is calculated by the equation: p = (wAQ vRT/v) In the equation, R is the gas constant (8.31 Pa mnol-K-1). The pressure is expressed in pascals (Pa), the volume in cubic meters (ml), mass in grams and T .n kelvins (K). T = 273.15 + t, if t is ,neasured in degrees Celsius \u00b0C). (2) Solid samples are loaded into 5- mi.d. glass tubing between glass wool plugs. The following Figure 2 is a drawing of a sample holder and absorber system.

The sample tube is connected by aground- glassball-and-socket joint to a similar tube containing the sorbent. The'sorbent tube contains two sections of sorbent material (front and backup) separated by glass wool. The sections are approximately 15 mm and 10 mm long, respectively. The backup section is used to check for compound release from the front section. (3) Liquid samples are contained in a holder as shown in the following Figure 3: BILLING CODE 6560-31-M Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules 77349 FIGURE 3 -LIQUID COMPOUND SAMPLING SYSTEM N2 Out N2 in Glass wool *- Sorbent tube glass frit BILLING COOE 6550-31-C 77350 , Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules Incoming nitrogen gas (containing no interfering impurities) passes through a coarse frit and bubbles through a 38 cm column of liquid sample. The stream passes through a glass wool column to trap aerosols and then through a sorbent tube, as described above. The pressure drops across the glass wool column and the sorbent tube are negligible. (4) With both solid and liquid samples, at the end of the sampling time, the front and backup sorbent sections are analyzed separately. The compound on each section is desorbed by adding the sorbent from that section to 1.0 ml of desorption solvent in a small vial and allowing the mixture to stand at a suitable temperature until no more test compound desorbs. The desorption solvent must contain no impurities which would irterfere with the analytical method of choice. The resulting solutions are analyzed quantitatively by a suitable analytical method to determine the weight of sample desorbedifrom each section. The choice of the analytical method, sorbent, and desorption solvent is dictated by the nature of the test material. Commonly used sorbents include charcoal, Tenax GC, and XAD-2. The sorbent, desorption solvent, and analytical methods employed must be described in 'detail. (5) The desorption efficiency must be measured for every combination of sample, sorbent, and solvent used. The desorption efficiency is determined by injecting a known mass of sample onto a sorbent and later desorbing it and analyzing for the mass recovered. For each combination of sample, sorbent, and solvent used, the determination. must be made in triplicate at each of three concentrations. Desorption efficiency may vary with the concentration of the actual sample aid it is important to measure the efficiency at or near the concentration of sample under gas saturation test procedure conditions. (6) To assure that the gas is indeed saturated with test compound vapor, each compound nust be sampled at three differing gas flow rates. Appropriate flow rates will depend on the test compound and test temperature. \"If the calculated vapor pressure shows no dependence on flow rate, then the gas is assumed to be saturated. \u00a7 772.122-4 Octanot/water partition coefficient '(a) Purpose. This standard is designed to develop values of octanol/water partition coefficient of chemical substances and mixtures. The EPA will use the numerical values of the octanol/ water partition coefficient obtained tohelp assess environmental fate, health, and environmental effects of chemical substances. (b) Definition. \"Octanol/water partition coefficient\" (Ko,) is defified as the equilibrium ratio of the molar concentrations of a chemical in n- octanol and water, in dilute solution. K.. is a constant for a given chemical at a given temperature. (c) Good laboratorypractice. The Good Laboratory Practices Standards for Physical, Chemical, Persistence, and Ecological Effects Testing, in \u00a7 772.110- 2, must be followed in performing this standard.\"' (d) Conditions.-(1) Special laboratory equipment. (i) A thermostatic bath, or chamber, or room with a shaker and temperature -. control as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. (!i) An.ultracentrifuge with temperature control as specified in -paragraph (d)(2) of this section. (iii) Stainless steel or glass centrifuge tubes with sealable caps. Special glass centrifuge tubes can be used up to approximately 12,000G, and.stainless steel tubes can be used at higher G values. (iv) A mechanical shaker. (v) A Hach 2100 Turbidimeter (or an equivalent instrument). (vi) A pH meter capable of resolving differences of 0.1 pH unit or less. (2) Temperature control. The temperature of the water bath, or chamber, or room, and the ultracentrifuge must be controlled to (25_t 1) c. (3) Purity of solvents. n-Octanol, purified as described in the test procedures'under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, and distilled or reagent grade water, i.e. ASTM.Type II water or an equivalent grade must be used. ASTM Type II water is described in ASTM D 1193-77, \"Standard Specification for Reagent Water\", which Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, Pa. 19103. It is also available for inspection at the - Office of the Federal Register Information Center, Room 8301, 1100 L Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20408.- * (4) Concentration of solute. All experiments must be carried out at a concentration C < 0.01M (Molar)-in octanol and water and well below the solubility in either phase. (5) Equilibration time. In general, 1 hour of gentle agitation is sufficient to reach equilibrium. For surfactants, at least-16 hours is Tequirbd to reach equilibrium. (6) Octanol/water volume ratio. The ratio of the volumes of the two liquids must be-adjusted as appropriate for therelative solubility of the chemical In octanol and water. By adjusting the volumes, concentration errors (resulting from analytical errors) are minimized and errors resulting from dividing large numbers by small numbers are kept to a minimum. (7) Chemical analysis of the octanol and water phases. In determining the K., value for any given solute, the octanol and water phases must be analyzed for the chemical. An analytical method should be selected which is most applicable to the analysis of the specific chemical. Chromatographic methods are preferable because of their compound specificity in analyzing the parent chemical without interference from impurities. Whenever practicable, the chosen analytical method should have a precision within :h5 percent. (8) Emulsification and ultracentrifugation. Gentle shaking must be used to minimize the formation of emulsions. Ultracentrifugation Is necessary to separate troublesome emulsions and to separate the octanol and water phases. Therefore, ultracentrifugation must be carried out at 250C for 20 minutes in a temperature controlled ultracentrifuge, The acceleration (G) value required to break the emulsion and to achieve complete separation of the octanol and water phases can be determined by trial-and- error experimentation. (9) Equilibration vessel. (i) If feasible, equilibration should be carried out In a centrifuge tube (stainless steel or glass) with a.sealable cap. The centrifuge tubes must be almost completely full. In this way, partitioning with air will be minimized, especially'for volatile chemicals, and the mixture will be completely mixed. (ii) Very hydrophobic chemicals, with K.,. in the order of 10 to 106, require relatively large volumes of the aqueous phase. Hence, for these chemicals, equilibration must be carried out In a large ground-glass stoppered flask. (10) Speciation effects. The octanol/ water partition coefficient, K.,,, has been defined in paragraph (b) of this section. The mathematical statement of K., is: Equation 1 K1,,-- 0oct-ol Cwater where C is the molar concentration of the solute in octanol and water at equilibrium at a given temperature. (i) If the chemical does not associate or dissociate in octanol and water, then equation (1) must be used and Ko,, must be determined at molar concentrations C < 0.01M and Ci=0.01C. Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules (ii) If the chemical associates in octanol or water or in both liquids, then equation (1) must be used and K,., must be determined at molar concentrations C < 0.0M, C1=o.1C, C2=0.01C, C3=o.oo1C ....... When K, is constant at two molar concentrations differing by a factor of 10, then the effect of association has been minimized or eliminated. (iii) If a molecule dissociates or associates in octanol and water, then equation (1) must be modified to take into account such speciation changes as ionization, aggregation, and hydration. For the special case where no association takes place in octanol and only dissociation takes place in water, equation (1) becomes: Equation 2 KOW =Coctanol (1 -' water) (Cwater) where a represents the degree of dissociation in water. For chemicals which reversibly ionize or protonate (e.g., carboxylic acids, phenols, or anilines), equation (2) must be used with water buffered at pH 5.0, 7.0, and 9.0. Buffers described in the test procedures under paragraph (g)(1](ii) of this section must be used. (11) Prerinsing of all transfer vessels. All transfer vessels must be prerinsed with a portion of the equiloriu aqueous phase prior to transfer for analysis. (e) Procedures. The test conditions outlined in paragraph (d) of this section must be followed in carrying out all octanol/water partition coefficient experiments. Recommended procedures are given in the test procedures under paragraph (g) of this section. (f) Reporting. In addition to the following requirements, information specified in \u00a7 772.110-2(h) of Good Laboratory Practice Standards must be reported. This test standard is designed to determine the octanol/water partition coefficient of the test chemical in the range 10 to 106. For chemicals outside this range, the octanol/water partition coefficient should be reported as K,,.<1o or K.,,>106 with no further quantification. (1) Specific analytical and recovery procedures. (i) Provide a detailed description or reference for the analytical procedure used, including the calibration data and precision. (ii) If extraction methods were used to separate the solute from the octanol andaqueous phases, provide a description of the extraction method and recovery data. (iii) Report the experimental (G) value required to break the emulsion and to achieve complete separation of the octanol and water phases. (2) Ttst data. For each individual determination, report the octanol/water partition coefficient at each concentration of the test substance, including the molar concentration of chemical in each phase [Cd and C,,t,,]. In addition, report the mean value of K.,, and the standard deviation. (g) Test procedures--1) Reogents and solutions. (i) Octanol and water. Very pure n-Octanol can be obtained as follows: Wash pure n-octanol (minimum 98 percent pure) sequentially with 0.IN HSO4, with 0.IN NaOH, then with distilled water until neutral. Dry the n- octanol with magnesium sulfate and distill twice in a good distillation column under reduced pressure [b.p. about 80'C at 0.27 kPa (2 torr)]. The octanol produced must be at least 99.9 percent pure, e.g., a grade equivalent to Fisher Scientific Co. No. A-402 \"Certified Octanol-l\". Distilled or reagent grade (ASTM Type 11J water must be used. {ii) Buffer solutions. Prepare buffer solutions using reagent grade chemicals in distilled or reagent grade water as follows: pH 5.0-250 mL of 0.M potassium hydrogen phthalate: 113 mL of 0.1M sodium hydroxide. Adjust final volume to 500 mL with reagent grade water. pH 7.0-250 mL of O.1M potassium dihydrogen phosphate; 145 mL of 0.IM sodium hydroxide. Adjust final volume to 500 mL with reagent grade water. pH 9.0-250 mL of 0.075M borax: 09 mL of 0.1M HCI. Adjust final volume to 500 niL with reagent grade water. Check the pH of each buffer solution with a pH meter at 25\"C and adjust to pH 5.0, 7.0, or 9.0, if necessary. (iii) Presaturation of the solvents. Before a partitioning experiment is carried out, prepare octanol saturated with water and water saturated with octanol. Add purified n-octanol to a large stock bottle and sufficient distilled water to saturate it. Shake the flask for 24 hours on a mechanical shaker. Then allow sufficient time for the mixture to stand so that the two phases separate. Repeat this procedure using another large stock bottle containing distilled water and sufficient octanol to saturate it. The desired quantities of the presaturated solvents can be taken from these stock bottles for each partition experiment.(iv) Preparation of test solution. Prepare a solution of the test material in octranol at a molar concentration of 10-2 to 10-3M. (2) Procedure. (i) Add a small volume of the octanol test solution (1 to 5 mL] to a centrifuge tube with a sealable cap as described under paragraph (d](9] of this section. (ii) The volume of water required is variable, depending upon the amount of chemical required for chemical analysis. Generally, 20-40 mL of water should be sufficient. Add the required volume of water to the centrifuge tube as described under paragraph (d)(6) of this section. Make sure that the centrifuge tube is almost completely full. In this way, partitioning with air will be minimized. This is important, especially when determining K, for volatile chemicals. (iii) Equilibrate the samples at 25'C in a constant temperature bath, or chamber, or room by gently shaking the centrifuge tube for 1 hour. Avoid vigorous shaking which may cause troublesome emulsions to form. For surfactants, a minimum of 16 hours of shaking is required as described in paragraph (d](5) of this section. (iv) Centrifuge the samples at 25'C for 20 minutes to break any emulsion and to separate the octanol and water phases. Evidence for breaking the emulsion and separation of the water and octanol phases can be obtained using a turbidimeter. The acceleration (G) value required to break the emulsion and to achieve complete separation of the octanol and water phases can be determined by trial-and-error experimentation. (v) Sample the octanol and water phases as follows: (A) Withdraw by pipet a known volume of the octanol phase (approximately 1/2 or less of the total octanol phase) and transfer to an analysis cell or diluting solvent. Before transferring the aliquot of the octanol phase, wipe the outside of the pipet with a paper tissue. (B) Remove by pipet the remainder of the octanol phase including the interfacial layer and discard. (C) Insert another clean pipet close to the bottom of the centrifuge tube and carefully withdraw a known volume of the aqueous phase. Wipe the bottom exterior part of the pipet with a tissue and discharge the aqueous sample directly into an analysis cell or extraction solvent.

Determine the concentration in the octanol and water phases. Express the concentration of the chemical in octanol and water in moles/liter (M). (vii) Determine the partition coefficient in triplicate (Steps i through vii) at two concentrations of the test material C < 0.01M and C, = 0.1C as described in paragraph (d)(10)(i) of this section. If K., is not constant at C and C1 then association effects should be considered. Therefore, follow steps i through vii at lower concentrations until Kow is constant at two concentrations differing by a factor of 10 as described in paragraph (d)(1O(ii) of this section. (viii) Very hydrophobic chemicals (with K0w on the order of :f04 to 10) require relatively large volumes of the aqueous phase as described in paragraph (d)(6) and (9)(ii) of this section. Hence, for very'hydrophobic materials, equilibrate the octanol and water phases in a large ground-glass stoppered flask as described in step iii. For the final phase separation, transfer the two phase mixture to centrifuge tubes that have been prerinsed with * some of the aqueous phase, centrifuge as described in step iv, withdraw aliquots from each centrifuge tube as described in-step v, and recombine for analysis.

This standard is designed - to develop soil leachihg data on chemical substances at an environmentally relevant temperature. The EPA will use these data to evaluate adsorption and desorption of chemicals in the environment. (b) Definitions. (1) \"Catio'n exchange capacity\" (CEC) is the sum total of exchangeable cations that a soil can adsorb; expressed in milliequivalents per 100 grams or milliequivalents per gram of soil.(2) \"Particle size analysis\" is the determination of the various amounts of the different particle sizes in a soil sample (i.e., sand, silt, clay) usually by sedimentation, sieving, micrometry or combinations of these methods. The names and size limits of these particles as widely used in the United-States are: Very coarse sand-2.0 to 1.0 nun dia Coarse sand-1.0 to 0.5 mnm Medium sand-0.5 to 0.25 mm\" Fine sand-0.25 to 0.125 Very sand--O.125 to mm Silt-0.062 to 0.002 mm Clay-<0.002 mm (3) \"R1\" is the furthest distance traveled by a test material on a thin- layer chromatography plate divided by, the distance traveled by a solvent front (arbitrarily) set at 10.0 cm in soil TLC studies). (4) \"Soil\" is the unconsolidated mineral material on the immediate surface of the earth that serves as a natural medium for the growth of land plants, and has-been subjected to and influenced by various factors such as parent material, climate, macro- and microorganisms, topography, and time. (5) \"Soil aggregate\" is the combination or arrangement of soil separates (sand, silt, clay) into secondary units. These units may be arranged in the profile in a distinctive characteristic pattern fnd can be classified on the basis of size, shape, and degree of distinctness into classes, types, and grades. - (6] \"Soil classification\" is the systematic arrangement of soils into groups or categories on the-basis of their characteristics; broad groupings are made on the basis of general characteristics and subdivisions on the basis of more detailed differences in specific properties. The soil classification system used today in the United Stats is the 7th Approximation- Comprehensive System. (7) \"Soil horizon\" is a layer of soil or- soil material approximately parallel to the land surface and differing from - adjacent layers in physical, chemical, and biological properties or characteristics such as color, structure, texture, consistency, kinds, and numbers of organisms present, degree of acidity or alkalinity, and various other properties. (8) \"Soil order\" is the broadest category of soil classification based on general similarities of physical/chemical properties resulting from formation by similar general genetic processes. (9) \"Soil organic matter\" is the organic fraction of the soil; it includes plant and animal residues at various stages of decomposition, cells and tissues of soil organisms, and substances synthesized by.the soil population.-(10) \"Soil pH\" is the negative logarithm to the base 10 of the hydrogen ion activity of a soil as determined by means of a suitable sensing electrode coupled with a suitable reference electrode at a 1 : 1 soil : water ratio. (11) \"Soil series\" is the basic unit of soil classification. It is a subdivision of a family, and it consists of soils which are essentially alike in all major profile characteristics except the texture of the \"A\" horizon. (12) \"Soil texture\" refers to the classification of soils based on the relative\" proportions of the various soil separates present (i.e., clay, sandy clay, silty clay, clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, silt loam, silt, sandy loam, loamy sand, sand). (c) Good laboratory practice. The Good Laboratory Practice Standards for Physical, Chemical, Persistence, and Ecological.Effects Testing, in \u00a7 772.110- 2, must be followed in performing this standard. (d) Conditions. (1) The number and type of soils to be used will be specified in the Test Rule, (2) Equipment required: Distilled- deionized water adjusted to pH 7 by boiling to remove C02; clean glass plates (TLC); glass rods or a variable thickness plate spreader; masking tape; closed chromatographic chambers: ,analytical instrumentation necessary .and appropriate for the detection and quantitative analysis of the test chemical. (3) The test procedure may be run at 23 -\u00b1 5\u00b0C. (4) Only gentle crushing and grinding of the air dried soil must be employed to reduce aggregate size before or during sieving. (e) Procedures. (1) First, air dried soils must be sieved at 250 micrometers. (2) Water must be added to the sieved soil until a smooth, moderately fluid slurry is attained (approximately Y4 ml H20 added for each gram of soil). (3) The soil slurry must be evenly and quickly spread' across the clean glass plate by use of a variable thickness plate spreader, tise of a glass rod, or other available methods. If a glass rod Is used, layer thickness must be controlled by affixing multiple layers of masking tape along the plate edges. Soil layer thickness must be 500-750 micrometers, (4) The plates must be air dried at 25\u00b0C for a minimum of 24 hours after uniform slurry application is achieved. (5) A horizontal line must be scribed 11.5 cm above the base through.the soil layer down to the glass so as to stop solvent movement. (6) The test chemical must then be spotted at 1.5 cm above the base. For radiolabeled materials 0.5-5 g77352 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules containing 0.01-0.03 pCi of 14c labeled compound may be used. (7] At least three replicate plates must be used for each soil. (8) If the compound is volatile, a clean plate must be placed over the soil TLC plate to impede volatilization. (9) The plate must be immersed base down at some angle from the vertical in a closed chromatographic chamber containing I-H20 at a height of 0.5 cm. (10) The solvent front must migrate to the 11.5 cm line before the plates are removed from the chamber. (11) Rf values must be determined. Zonal extraction, plate scanning, or any other method or combination of methodssuitable for detection of the parent test chemical may be used.

ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This notice proposes good laboratory practice (GLP) standards for the development of data on physical, chemical, persistence, and ecological effects fo chemical substances for which EPA will require testing under section 4 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (Pub. L 94-469,90 StaL 2003,15 U.S.C., 2601, et seq.). These proposed standards supplement \"Good Laboratory Practice Standards and Health Effects,\" proposed on May 9, 1979 (44 FR 27362). The good laboratory practice standards include general standards that apply to all laboratory testing for physical, chemical,77353 Federal Register / Vol. 45,. No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules persistence, and ecological effects under section 4 of TSCA. When these proposed good laboratory practice standards are made final, they will be included as requirements, where appropriate, in testing rules promulgated for specific chemicals. Compliance with, these standards will assure the reliability and adequacy of data submitted pursuant to testing rules promulgatged under section 4.

Ritch, Jr., Industry Assistance Office, (TS-799), Office of Pesticides and Toxic Substances, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. F-427, 401 M.St., SW., Washington, D.C. 20460, (800-424- 9065), In D.C.: SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Introduction Under section 4(b) of TSCA (90 Stat. 2003, et seq., 15 U.S.C., 2601 et seq.], EPA is preparing proposals for standards for the development of test data. These data are to be used to determine if particular chemicals present, or do not present, unreasonable risks, to health or the environment. The proposal consists of this notice, a separate notice titled, \"Proposed environmental effects test standards for Toxic Substances Act test rules- Physical, chemical, and environmental persistence characteriktics,\" which appears elsewhere in this copy of the Federal Register, and previously proposed test standards published in the Federal Register of May 9,1979 (44 FR 27334), and July 26, 1979 (44 FR 44054). In this notice, EPA is proposing general Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) ,Standards for Physical, Chemical, Persistence, and Ecological Effects Testing. These GLP Standards are designed to assure the reliability and adequacy of data submitted, and are issued to supplement previously proposed GLP Standards for Health Effects (44 FR 27362) issued on May 9, 1979. These practices are proposed to apply generally to all testing for physical, chemical, persistence, andecological effects conducted under section 4 of TSCA, by or on behalf of manufacturers or processors of chemical substances or mixtures. Separate GLP standards for health effects testing and physical, chemical, persistence, and ecological effects testing are necessary for a number of reasons. Testing to be.conducted in accordance With proposed health effects standards is primarily concerned with effects on a limited number of animal species. It does not address the analytical problems associated with physical, chemical, and persistence testing nor does it address the special problems associated with the wide variety of vertebrates, invertebrates, and plant species covered in ecological effects testing. While these'GLP Standards will apply generally to all prescribed tests for physical, chemical, persistence, and ecological effects, individual tests may contain specific GLP instructions that apply to that particular test. I. Previously Proposed Good Laboratory Practice Standards for Health Effects EPA proposed new Parts 770, 771, and 772 to be added to Chapter I of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, published in the Federal Register of May 9, 1979 (44 FR 27335). The preamble to proposed test standards for physical, chemical, and environmental persistence characteristics, which appear elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, outlines the content of the several parts and subparts. Part of the proposal of May 9, 1979, included proposed Good Laboratory Practice Standards for Health Effects (frequently cited simply as \"Health GLP\") (44 FR 27362) for inclusion in 40 CFR 772.110-1. Proposed GLP Standards for Physical, Chemical, and Environmental Persistence Characteristics and Ecological Effects Testing presented here are for inclusion as \u00a7 772.110-2, in the same part and subpart identified for the Health GLP. Preamble discussions of the authority -and need for GLP Standards as they apply to testing for health effects are, in general, equally applicable to these proposed standards. Problems with the - adequacy of testing data were identified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the mid 1970's and were reportedto the Senate Subcommittee on Health (Committee on Labor and Public Welfare). FDA's inspections of several pharmaceutical houses and c6ntract laboratories found unacceptable ' laboratorypractices that, in turn, called into-question the v-alidity of test data submitted.-Unacceptable practicesincluded selective reporting and underreporting of results, lack of adherence to specified protocols, inadequate qualification and supervision of personnel, poor animal care procedures, poor recordkeeping techniques, and the geneial failure of sponsors to monitor studies. Later inspections and audits done jointly by FDA and EPA also indicated that testing facilities do not always follow good laboratory practices. I. Proposed Good Laboratory Practice Standards These proposed GLP Standards prescribe methodology for the selection, handling, and storage of the test substance; personnel qualifications, and the organization of the testing laboratory; minimal facilities; equipment specifications; operation of the testing facilities; requirements for a study plan and the conduct of a study; requirements for recordkeeping and reports; and specific appendices applicable to testing for physical, chemical, and persistence characteristics and to testing for ecological effects. Proposed GLP Standards for Physical, Chemical, and Persistence Characteristics and Ecological Effects Testing have been harmonized as much as possible with the proposed GLP Standards for Health Effects Testing. The Health GLP Standards have, in turn, been harmonized to the extent practicable with the GLP issued by the FDA. A detailed comparison is included in the preamble to the GLP Standards for Health Effects Testing. Additional general discussion and comparisons with the Health GLP are presented in the following paragraphs ana concentrate on differences between the Health and Environmental GLP Standards. (a) Introduction. Statements of the authority, purpose, and scope of GLP Standards proposed here are similar to the authority and purpose stated for GLP Standards for Health. These GLP Standards for Physical, Chemical, and Persistence, and Ecological Effects Testing are consistent with the guidance for GLP issued by several professional societies and EPA program offices. Definitions incorporated in these GLP Standards include several terms not included in the GLP Standards for Health, mainly because environmental testing covers different types of testing. Also, a few of the definitions are made broader, such as \"testing facility,\" which will cover laboratories which perform a wider variety of testing, with different methods and test species, than do laboratories that do health testing.77354 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules (b) Testing and control substances. Requirements for documenting the purity of the test substance and for minimizing contamination or alteration during storage and handling are intended to assure consistency of testing results. The language of these proposed Standards differ slightly from the language in the Health GLP, but essentially the requirements on the testing laboratory are the same. (c) Organization andpersonnel. This tection of the standard is to assure that laboratories doing testing are staffed by personnel who are competent to do the testing, that the staff and laboratory are organized in a manner that is likely to lead to proper conduct of the tests, and that the laboratory has a suitable organization, staff, and procedures to implement good quality assurance. There are several small differences between requirements in this section and requirements in the Health GLP Standards. These GLP Standards, for example, require that the quality assurance unit monitor all work but it only recommends, not requires, that the unit be separate and independent from those conducting the work. This was made a recommendation in order to allow small laboratories with limited staffs some flexibility in conforming with this provision of the GLP Standards. These GLP Standards also require development of a quality assurance plan prior to starting of testing, not as testing proceeds, in order to make the plan available for Agency review at any time. These Standards also require maintaining a master schedule of all testing in order to provide an indication of total work load and allow evaluation of whether testing was done under overloaded conditions. (d) Facilities. Requirements for facilities in this GLP Standard are considerably shorter than the reauirements in the GLP Standards for Healtbbeeause the Health GLP includes detailed standards for facilities for animals. This would be impractical to include in these Standards since such a wide variety of species are included in ecological effects testing standards. Thezefoem specific requirements for facilitie, for testing for environmental effects using animals are proposed in I 772.1MO-4 of these proposed GLP Standards and in specific GLP sections of some, individual test standards. (e) Equipment Standards are proposd in this section to assure that equipment in testing laboratories is properly designed and adequately maintained so that reliable data can be collected. In addition, the standards require that records be maintained of equipmentinspection, maintenance, testing, calibration, standardization, failure, malfunction, and repair. (f) Testing facilities operation. To assure consistent, high-quality data, testing laboratories are to have written standard operating procedures and adequate manuals and records also are to be maintained. The language of standards proposed in this section differs slightly from language in the health GLP in order to allow for different types of facilities needed for physical, chemical, persistence, and ecological testing. In addition to the GLP requirements for facilities in \u00a7 772.110- 2(f), there also are requirements for special facilities for ecological effects testing outlined in \u00a7 772.110-4 of these proposed GLP Standards. Additional requirements for facilities also many be outlined in standards for individual tests because they are test specific. (g) Study plan and conduct of a study. This section of the GLP Standard is to assure that tests of chemical substances are planned carefully, and then are carried out in accordance with the plan. or otherwise that deviations are documented. The wording of this section differs only slightly from that in the corresponding section of the Health CLP in order to allow for differences in the types of tests to which they apply. In addition, this GLP requires information on chemical stability which EPA regards as important in planning long-term tests or other types of test in which transformation of the chemical may affect results. (h) Records andreports. Final reports from the testing of chemicals must be complete in order to permit EPA and the test sponsor to judge adequacy and reliability of data to be used in assessing the potential fate of or environmental hazard from a substance. Differences from the Health GLP are minor; one difference is that this Environmental GLP requires reporting of quality-assurance methods used in testing-a factor which EPA counts as important in judging acceptability of testing. (i) Physical, chemical and pers irtence testirg. Testing for physical, chemical, and persistence characteristics has several specific GLP requirements above and beyond the requirements proposed in the main portion of these GLP Standards. These special requirements are detailed in \u00a7 772.110-3, and deal with special qualifications and training for personnel, and with special requirements for the testing laboratory. Persons who perform tests for physical. chemical, and persistence characteristics of chemicals need to have training and/or experience inchemistry, biology, microbiology, or closely related areas. Laboratories must have adequate space for a variety of specialized equipment. Special requirements are proposed to protect laboratory personnel from potentially dangerous exposure to sewage during certain microbiological tests. () Ecological effects testing. Testing for ecological effects of chemical substances generally involves the exposure of a wide variety of plants and animals of chemical substances and mixtures. Consequently, there are many special GLP requirements that apply to the personnel, facilities, operation. planning and conduct, and reporting of ecological effects testing. These special GLP requirements are detailed in \u00a7 772110-4 of this GLP Standard. (1] Personnel Several diseases and infections that affect people also may present a threat to the organisms involved in testing for ecological effects of chemical substances. Consequently, all illnesses of laboratory personnel are to be reported and infected persons who may affect the testing are to be excluded from contacting the test organisms. Most testing of chemicals using fish, birds, other animals, or plants requires first the availability of organisms, and then their maintenance in often delicate cultures. It also may involve sophisticated analytical chemistry techniques as well as pathological examination. EPA, therefore, in these GLP Standards requires that the tests be conducted by personnel with sufficient training and/or experience in appropriate specialty areas such as biology, veterinary science, pathology, analytical chemistry, fisheries biology, and other specialty areas. In addition to the special requirements contained in \u00a7 772.110-4. some of the test standards for ecological testing also contain additional personnel requirements. (2) Facilities. Testing of chemicals for ecological effects is likely to involve work with a large number of different types of plants and animals. Laboratories doing the testing must, therefore, have adequate facilities to care for the different test sedes, to avoid mixup, and to provide that the several different types of tests do not interfere with each other. Proposed GLP Standards in \u00a7 772.110-4. applicable to ecological effects testing, are intended to guard against such types of problems. Reference is made to general provisions to the Animal Welfare Act and to other general standards for the care and testing of animals (including fish]. The standards require adequate rooms for separation of species and tests where interferences may result, but they do not require categorical separation of allII77355 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Proposed Rules species or of all different types of tests. Separate spaces are required for certain aseptic procedures, for cleaning and maintenance of equipment, and for facilities for personnel such as lockers, showers, toilets, and washing areas. -(3) Testing facilities operation. Section 772.110-4 outlines the requirements for standard operating procedures for the handling of organisms, and includes specific paragraphs on special aspects of care for and handling of organisms. These special GLP provisions are intended to assure that testing is done with strong, healthy organisms, and that the test. results are not affected by mix-up or by damage from poor handling or extraneous factors (4) Study plan and conduct of a study. In addition to general requirements for a study plan and conduct of testing outlined in \u00a7 772.110-2(g) of these GLP Standards, \u00a7 772.110-4(e) provides for specific requirements for testing for ecological effects. The study plan needs to consider how test organisms are selected, as well as their indentification, feeding, and methods of dosing with the test chemical. This \u00a7 772.110-4(e) also requires specific indentification of test organisms and identification of gross findings by a pathologist doing a histopathological examination. (5) Reporting of the study results. Reports of ecological effects testing are to include specific details on the numbers and types of test organisms, and on the chemical dosages adminsitered and the manner in which they were administered. (k) Inspection of testing facility. The Agency will conduct inspections of testifig facilities and audits of data developed by those facilities if the testing was, or is being done in support of TSCA regulations according to Part 772, Subparts L, M, or N. IV. Economic Analysis These GLP standards are very similar to FDA's Good Laboratory Practice Regulations for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies which became law on June 20, 1979. By now, after several years of industry-wide discussion and development of the FDA GLP's and after one year of actual enforcement, regulations have already impacted the cost of performing animal toxicity studies. Thus, it is conceivable that the proposed EPA GLP environmental standards will have little or no further impact on testing costs in'laboratories which conduct both health effects and environmental effects testing. In addition, many of the laboratories that do environmental testing already adhere to similar GLP requirements issued byEPA program offices and several professional societies such as the American Public Health Association (APHA), American Water Works Association (AWWA), the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), and the EPA program offices for Water and pesticides. Due to the fact that Good Laboratory Practice standards are not specific protocols, itis impossible to provide an itemized component cost breakdown. In fact, GLP's represent operational procedures which are designed to affect all methods and tests. Thus, the economic impact of GLP standards can only be measured in terms of their relative impact,.e.g., percentage increase, upon the cost of performing any and all tests. Private-estimates from industrial and independent contract testing laboratories secured by EPA contractors have ranged from 10 to 80 percent increase in the cost of testing; the general consensus being that GOP regulations have increased testing costs by an average of 50 percent over pre- GLP prices. Unfortunately, it is impossible at this time to obtain a more accurate estimate of the economic impact of GLP regulations The following examples demonstrate how GLP standards are actually operational procedures and why it is impossible to calculate an itemized component cost breakdown: (1) Most laboratories did not have a Quality Assurance Unit (QAU) in early pre-GLP times. Much of the time spent by QAU personnel can be charged as a Direct Labor Cosf onea study, but quite often the QA Unit is partially supported -by-overhead. The impact of this overhead expense depends on the size of the unit, the salaries paid, the size of the laboratory, the relative magnitude of the overhead burden, and the efficiency with which the QAU performs its job. (2) The preparation of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) is entirely an overhead expense. It takes management, technical (both senior and junior), and clerical time to write SOP's initially and to continually update them. The use of SOP's does probably increase technical efficiency and minimize training time. The magnitude of these effects depends upon whether or not a laboratory previbusly had SOP'S. (3) Other procedures.regarding test articles, protocols, record keeping, etc. undoubtedly add additional labor costs to each test. The magnitude of the impact depends upon procedures which were followed before GLP's came into effect. (4) Other requirements concerning the adequacy and design of facilities; theadequacy, maintenance, and calibration of equipment; and the adequacy, supervision, training, and experience of available technical and management personnel are impossible to describe In terms of economic impact on test costs due to variations in the availability of these resources at each laboratory, both before and after GLP's became law. EPA will do an economic analysis to estimate the cost of testing for each environmental test standard proposed In Subparts L and M. Each estimate will be made on the assumption that these GLP standards apply, and therefore will include GLP incremental costs In the total cost estimated for each test. V. Public Record EPA has established a public record for this rulemaking (document number OPTS-46004A) Which along with a complete index is available for inspection in the OPTS Reading Room from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. (Rm E-447, 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. 20480). This record includes basic information considered by the Agency in developing this proposal. The Agency will supplement the record with additional information as it is received. The record includes the following information: (1) USEPA-OPTS. \"Proposed Physical, Chemical, Persistence and Ecological Effects Test Standards for Toxic Substance Control Act Test Rules.\" (2) USEPA-OPTS. \"Proposed Physical, Chemical, Persistence and Ecological Effects Test Standards for Toxic Substance Cofitrol Act Test Rules Support Document.\" (3) USEPA-OPTS. \"Toxic Substances Control Act Premanufacture Testing of New Chemical Substances\" (44 FR 16240) and all public comments received on this discussion document.

Published documents cited in this preamble are incorporated in the record by reference. EPA will accept additional and relevant material for the record at any time between this proposal and the final designation of the rulemaking -record4 on or before the date of promulgation of these requirements as prescribed by TSCA section 19(a)(3). VI. Public Meetings EPA personnel responsible for developing these proposed Environmental Test Standards will be available to meet with interested persons from companies, trade associations, organized labor and citizen organizations on February 10,1981 at- Skyline Inn. South Capitol & I Streets, SW., Washington, D.C. The meeting will be from I p.m. to 5 p.m. This location is three blocks east of the EPA Hieadquarters, Waterside Mall. 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. Persons who wish to make presentations should request time by contacting the Industry Assistance Office by telephone, either toll free (800-424-9065) or on 554- 1404 in Washington. Time will be scheduled between I p.m. and 5 p.m. The Agency will make a transcript of the sessions for inclusion in the official public record. Participation in a session will be limited to those who have requested that time to make oral comment. One purpose of providing this opportunity for oral comment is to provide EPA with information on costs and approaches to compliance for impacted companies, especially small ones. The other purpose of this public meeting is to allow EPA to digest the scope and nature of written comments on scientific and technical points before hearing oral argument or comment on them. The Agency's general criterion for allotting time will be that a person has an interpretation, data or experience that is best presented orally with the opportunity for cross-checking communication with the Agency. In this case, an additional criterion will be that a person has a review of the written commentary already submitted to share with the Agency. EPA's experience has shown that this roundtable format for public meetings by request that are open to the public yields more productive exchanges for both commentators andthe Agency. EPA encourages commentators to use the toll free telephone to ask questions of clarification early in the written comment period to aid their formulating their comments. Note.-Under Rxecutive O4er 22044. EPA is required to judge whether a regulation Is\"significant\" and therefore subject to the procedural requirements of the Order or whether it may follow other specialized development procedures. EPA labels these other regulations \"specialized.\" This regulation has been reviewed and it has been determined that it is a specialized regulation not subject to the procedural requirements of Executive Order 2044.

ACTION: Notice of Actions under NIH Guidelines for Research Involving - Recombinant DNA Molecules. SUMMARY: This notice sets forth actions taken by the Director, NIH, under the January 1980 NIH Guidelines for Research Involving RecombinintDNA Molecules (45 FR 6724). EFFECTIVE DATE: November 21, 1981. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Additional information can be obtained from Dr. William J. Gartland, Office of Recombinant DNA Activities (ORDA), National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20205. (301) 496-6051. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I am promulgating today several actions under the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules. These were reviewed and recommended for approval by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAO) at its meeting on September, 25-26, 1980. In accordance with Section IV-E-1-b of the NIH Guidelines, I find that these actions comply with the Guidelines and present no significant risk to health or the environment. This announcement provides background information on the actions including an analysis of correspondence concerning these actions received up to Octoiber 31, 1980. Immediately following this announcement, there appears.in the Federal Register a copy of revised NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules. These revised Guidelines differ from the previous version of the Guidelines promulgated on January 29, 1980 (45 FR 6724) by incorporating within them: changes in the Guidelines which were recommended at the RAC meeting of March 6-7, 1980, and promulgated on April 14, 1980 (45 FR 25366); changes in the Guidelines which were recommended at the RAC meeting of June 5-6,1980, and promulgated on July 29, 1980 (45 FR 50524); and changes in the Guidelines which were recommended at the RAC meeting of -September 25-26, 1980 and which are discussed in this announcement.I. Proposal To Introduce Genes Cloned in E. Coli K-12 into Arabidopsis Plants Through the Use of Agrobacterium Tumefaciens Carrying an E. Coli/Ti Hybrid Plasmid Vector Ina letter dated March 21, 1980, Dr. Donald J. Merlo of the University of Missouri-Columbia, requested an evaluation of the containment appropriate for the following protocol: A. A hybrid vector, constructed from the E. coli plasmid pBR325 and the origin of replicatibn and transfer genes of Agrqbacteriumrtumefaciens plasmid Ti, will be cloned in E. colt K-12. B. Arabidopsis DNA will be introduced into the E. colil/Ti hybrid plasmid and clone in E. colt K-12. C. The thiamine gene of E. coli will bed introduced into the E. colilTi vector carrying Arabidopsis DNA and cloned in E. coli K-12. D. The hybrid plasmid into which Arabidopsis DNA and the thiamine gene have been ligated will be transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens. E. Agrobacterium tumefaciens will be used to introduce the E. colilTi plasmid vector carrying the E. coi Thiamine gene and Arabidopsis DNA into Arabidopsis plants. The RAC discussed Dr. Merlo's proposed protocol at the June 5-6, 1980 meeting. The RAC stated that the first three steps of the proposed experiment are covered by Section 11-0 of the Guidelines. It was agreed that steps D and E are covered by Appendix E and that P3 containment is indicated. However, as the proposed inserted sequences were.well characterized, and as Arabidopsis DNA will be returned to Arabidopsis, the RAC suggested that containment for steps D and E could be lowered to P2. - Since this had not been published in the Federal Register for comment prior to the June 5-6,1980, RAC meeting, this proposed lowering would, howevel, have to be published in the Federal -Register for thirty days of comment and re-considered at the September 25-26, 1980 meeting. .In a letter dated July 22, 1980, Dr. Merlo described the proposed experiments in greater detail and requested that the containment conditions for steps D and E be lowered at least to P2 and preferably to P1. Dr. Merlo's proposal was published in the August 21, 1980, Federal Register (45 FR 55924). No comments were received during the thirty day comment period. The RAC, at its September 25-:26, 1980 meeting, once again discussed this issue. A motion to approve the experiments at the P2 level of containment failed by a vote of 4 in favor, 9 opposed, with 3abstentions, Then, by a vote of 12 In favor, 2 opposed, with 3 abstentions, the RAC recommended approval of the proposed experiments under PI containment. I accept this recommendation, and text has been added to Appendix E of the Guidelines indicating this. 11. Request for Certification of a Bacillus Stearothermophilus Derived Plasmid as the Vector Component of an HV1 Bacillus Subtilis Host-Vector System Dr. DavidB. Wilson of Cornell University, in a letter dated May 12, 1980, requested certification of a Bacillus stearothermophilus derived plasmid, pAB124, as the vector component of an HV1 Bacillus subtills host-vector system. The HVl-certified Bacillus subtilis strain RUB331 would be used as the host component. The RAC discussed this propog'al at the June 5-6, 1980 meeting. It was noted that Bacillus stearothermophilus Is a non-pathogenic thermophile found in soil near hot springs, on compost, etc. In addition, plasmid pAB124 can be transformed into and maintained In Bacillus subtilis by natural physiological methods; pAB124 might, therefore, be considered a plasmid indigenous to Bacillus subtilis. The committee agreed that this proposal should be published in the Federal Register for comment and acted upon at the September 25-26, 1980 meeting. Dr. Wilson's proposal was published for thirty days of comment in the August 21, 1980, Federal Register (45 FR 55925). No comments were received during this period. The RAC once again discussed the proposal at the September 25-20, 1980 meeting. The RAC recommended approval of the proposal by a vote of 16 in favor, none opposed, I accept this recommendation, and text has been added to Appendix D of the Guidelines indicating this. III. Request for Certification of a Bacillus Subtilis Strain as the Host Component of an HV2 Host-Vector System On March 28,1980, Dr. William Burke, Jr., of Arizona State University, requested certification of Bacillus subtilis strain ASB298 as the host component of an HV2 host-vector system. Dr. Burke's request appeared in the Federal Register of Aprir 30, 1980 (45 FR 28907). No comments were received during this period. Additional information was submitted by Dr. Burke in a letter dated May 13,1980. Dr. Burke's proposal was evaluated by an ad hoc working group and subsequently presented to the RAC at the June 5-6,1980 meeting, One RAC77372 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices reviewer said the working group was satisfied with the data presented, and said the single issue not addressed by Dr. Burke concerned the possibility of transfer of genetic information from ASB298 to other Bacilli by transformation. After some discussion of this point, the RAC deferred consideration of the proposal pending the submission of additional information on transformation frequencies in soil. In an addendum dated September 8, 1980, Dr. Burke supplied information on the persistence of ASB298 in sterile soil, and on the frequency of genetic exchange in both soil and under optimized laboratory conditions between strain ASB298 and highly transformable B. subtilis strains. A second notice concerning Dr. Burke's request subsequently appeared in the Federal Register of August 21. 1980 (45 FR 55925). No comments on this request were received by the NIH. The RAC reconsidered this request at its September 25-26,1980 meeting. On the basis of the strain's characteristics and the frequency of transformation in soil, the RAC recommended, by a vote of 14 in favor, none opposed, and 2 abstentions, that strain ASB298 be certified as the host component of a B. subtilis HV2 host-vector system. The RAC specified that ASB898 be used with plasmids certified as the vector components of HV1 Bacillus subtilis host-vector systems. I accept this recommendation, and text has been added to Appendix D of the Guidelines indicating this. IV. Proposed Amendments Of Section IV-E-2. In a letter dated April 10, 1980, Dr. Irving Johnson of Eli Lilly and Company, submitted several proposals to amend the Guidelines. One of these proposals would have amended Section IV-E-2 to include the following language: \"Appropriate representatives of industry shall also be chosen to provide expertise in fermentation technology, engineering, and other aspects of large- scale production.\" This proposal appeared in the Federal Register of April 30, 1980 (45 FR 28908). Two comments were received during the thirty day comment period. One commentator stated that: \"Any attempt to add industrial expertise to the committee * * * is to convert the committee to a self-appointed consensus standards organization.\" Another commentator said, \"We strongly object to (this] proposal *... The RAC considered this proposal at the June 5-6, 1980 meeting. The committee agreed that, while it wouldbe desirable to have a member with expertise in fermentation technology appointed to RAC. language specifying\"representatives of industry\" was inappropriate. The RAC agreed that the following amended language should be published for comment and considered at the September 1980 meeting: \"Members should be chosen to provide expertise in fermentation technology. engineering, and other aspects of large-scale production.\" In a letter dated July 25, 1980, Dr. Johnson requested that his original language amending Section IV-E-2 be reconsidered at the September 1980 meeting. Dr. Johnson's proposed language and the language constructed by the RAC both appeared for public comment in the Federal Register of August 21,1980 (45 FR 55928). One comment was received during the thirty day comment period: \"We have long held the view that the RAC membership should include persons versed in scientific aspects of industrial microbiology. As with the rest of the Committee, they should be selected for the excellence of their qualifications. Such persons would complement the present technical expertise of RAC by providing knowledge In areas of fermentation technology and large-scale industrial applications. This expertise differs from that of safety engineers and is concerned with basic biological problems of large-scale technology *.... The proposals to amend the language of Section IV-E-2 were discussed by the RAC at the September 25--26,1980 meeting. At that time, the RAC again felt that appointing fermentation technology expertise to RAC was desirable, but that the proposal language specifying appointment of \"representatives of industry\" was inappropriate. By a vote of 13 in favor, 2 opposed, and 2 absentions, the RAC recommended approval of the following language: \"Members should be chosen to provide expertise in fermentation technology, engineering, and other aspects of large-scale production.\" I accept the intent of the RAC recommendation that RAC \"members should be chosen to provide expertise in fermentation technology, engineering, and other aspects of large-scale production.\" I do not believe that it is necessary to change the NIH Guidelines or the RAC Charter in order to assure that the intent of the RAC be honored. This can be accomplished through appointment of one or more individuals with appropriate expertise to fill vacancies that periodically occur in RAC membership.V. Request to Clone Schizosaccharomyces Pombe DNA in Schizosaccharomyces Pombe Using Hybrid Plasmid Vectors Dr. Benjamin Hall of the University of Washington requested permission to clone Schizosaccharomycespombe DNA in Schizosaccharomycespombe using approved HV1 Saccharomyces cerevisiae/E coli hybrid plasmids as vectors. Dr. Hall pointed out that Schizosaccharomycespombe has been the subject of intense genetic studies in the laboratory and has been used to ferment beverages for human consumption. He requested that P be established as the level of physical containment. This proposal appeared in the August 21,1980, Federal Register (45 FR 55929). No comments were received during the thirty day comment period. The RAC discussed this proposal at its September 25-26,1980 meeting, and recommended approval by a vote of 17 in favor, none opposed. I accept this recommendation, and text has been added to Appendix E of the Guidelines indicating this. VI. Proposed Amendment of Appendix E of the Guidelines In a letter dated July 28,1980, Dr. Fritz Reusser of The Upjohn Company requested that two sections of Appendix E be amended. These sections currently read as follows: -\"Bacillus subtilis strains that do not carry an asporogenic mutation can be used as hosts specifically for the cloning of DNA derived from E. col K-12 and Streptomyces coelicolor using NIH- approved Staphylococcus aureus plasmids as vectors under P2 conditions. * \"Streptomyces coelicolor can be used as a host for the cloning of DNA derived from subtilis, E. coli K-12, or from S. aureus vectors that have been approved for use inB. subtilis under P2 conditions, using as a vector any plasmid indigenous to Streptomyces coelicolor or able to replicate in that host by natural biological mechanisms.\" The proposed revision would permit additional Streptomyces species to be utilized in these experiments. The spacies to be added are already included in Appendix A. Sublists C and D, as two groups of Streptomycetes known to exchange DNA by physiological means. Dr. Reusser noted that these species are not pathogenic for humans, animals or plants. The proposed revised sections of Appendix E would read as follows: -\"Bacillus subtilis strains that do not carry an asporogenic mutation can be used as hosts specifically for the cloning77373 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No., 227./ Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices of DNA derived from E. coli K-12 and Streptomyces coelicolor, S. aureofaciens, S. S. venezuelae using NIH- approved Staphylococcus aureus plasmids as vectors under conditions. coelicolor, S. rimosus, S. griseus, S. cyaneus, and S. venezuelae can be used as hosts for the cloning of DNA derived from B. subtilis, E. coli K-12, or from S. aureus vectors that have been approved for use in B. subtilis, under P2 conditions, using as vectors any plasmids indigenous to these Streptomyces species or able to replicate in these hosts by natural biological mechanisms.\" The proposed appeared in the Federal Register of August 21, 1980 (45 FR 55928). No comments were received - concerning the proposal during: the thirty day comment period. The RAC evaluated the proposal at the September 25-26, 1980 meeting, considering and voting separately on each of the two sections proposed to be amended. With regard to the first section, by a vote of 14 in favor, none opposed, and 3 abstentions, the RAC recommended that the proposed amended language be adopted, i.e.: * \"Bacillus subtlis strains that do not carry an asporogenic mutation can be used as hosts specifically for the cloning of DNA derived from E. coliK-12 and Strept6myces coelicolor S. aureofaciens, S. S. venezuelae NIH-approved Staphylococcus aureus plasmids as vectors under P2 conditions.\".I accept this recommendation, and this section of Appendix E has been so amended. The RAC then considered the second section proposed to be amended. During the discussion it was suggested that the language be modified to specify the use of \"nonconjugative\" plasmid vectors. By a vote of 15 in favor, none opposed, and 2 abstehtions, the RAC recommended approval of the following modified language:' 0 \"Streptomyces coelicolor S aureofaciens, S. cyaneus, S. venezuelae can be'used as hosts for the cloning of DNA derived from B. subtills, E. call K-12, or from S. aureus vectors that have been approved for use in B. subtilis, under P2 conditions, using as vectors any nonconjugative plasmids indigenous to these Streptomyces species or able to replicate in these hosts by natural biological mechanisms.\" Subsequent to the RAC meeting, two comments on this amended language were received by the NIH.One commentator wrote that the proposal: * would have the effect of reversing a previous decision by the RAC and increasing the level of containment required for experiments that have been permitted under' P2 conditions for some time. Thus, the amendment is a 'major action'; it does not seem appropriate that it be made part of the Guidelines in the absence of a 30-day period' providing ari opportunity for workers in the field and others to offer comments on it. \"It should also be noted that the concept of'conjugative' versus 'non-conjugative' plasmids has been derived.from enteric bacteria and may not apply to a wide variety of other bacterial species. For examplethe mechanism for genetic exchange in Streptomyces species is not fully understood; it may be a consequence of hyphal fusion that permits transfer of plasmid and chromosomal genes. If this is true, it may never be possible to isolate a 'non-conjugative' plasmid per se * * \" \"Since all of the Streptomyces species that exchange genetic information with S. coelicolor-are free-living non-pathogenic soil organisms-,nd since the change in the Guidelines originally proposed under Action 916 involved genes from only non-pathogenic, well-characterized donor bacteria, I urge your approval of the original proposal without the amendment.\" - The other commentator wrote: \"I would like to see this amended proposal published for public comment and put to a second vote at the next RAC meeting before you approve this action. The amended -proposal failed to receive sufficient consideration'of the following points. First of' all, in no previous actions regarding Streptomyces species was any consideration given during the deliberations to establish ' levels of physical containment as to whether the vectors were capable of mediating exchange of genetic information. Therefore, this action by the RAC is more restrictive than previous actions and, in my opinion, is. inconsistent with the intent of the RAC. In fact, experiments can be carried out at P2 levels of containment in which B. subtilis, E. coll K-12, or S. aureus vector DNA is cloned into S. coelicolor hosts using vectors capable of self-mediated exchange in accordance with Appendix E of the current NIH Guidelines. \"Second of all, the use of the term 'non-'conjugative' is inappropriate because the actinomycetes do not exchange genetic information by the process of conjugation as it is known for eubacteria. Rather actinomycetds exchange genetic information by heterokaryosis. In some experiments, the frequency of genetic exchange can be altered by the presence of plasmids and some plasmids can mediate their own transfer to new hosts. \"I feel that to restrict cloning in the actinomycetes to using 'non-conjugative' or non-self-transmissible vectors would be\" unduly harsh and would severely restrict research with this valuable group of organisms. Considering the level of potential hazard (which I consider minimal) and the potential benefit (which I view as.considerable), P2 containment Is more than sufficient protection regardless of the vectors employed.\" Taking into consideration these comments, I am deleting the requirement for use of nonconjugative plasmids in these systems. If anyone wishes to propose a requirement for use of nonconjugative plasmids in these systems, it will be published for comment in the Federal Register as a proposed major action for consideration .at a future RAC meeting. Accordingly, the relevant section of Appendix E has been amended to read as follows: a \"Streptomyces coelicoldr, S. aureofaciens, S. rmosus, S. griseus, S, cyaneus, and S. venezueole can be used as hosts for the cloning of DNA derived from B. subtilis, E. coli K-12, or fromi S. aureus vectors that have been approved for use In B subtilis, under P2 conditions, using as vectors any plasmids indigenous to these Streptomyces specieb or able to replicate In these hosts by natural biological mechanisms.\" VII. Request for Consideration of a Proposal to Clone the Tox A Gene of Staphylococcus Aureus In a memorandum dated July 29, 1980, Drs. Alan G. Barbour and Leonard W. Mayer of the Laboratory of Molecular Structure and Functions, Rocky -Mountain Laboratory, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Dieases, requested an assessment of the containment levels-appropriate for cloning the Staphylococcus aureus pyrogenic exotoxin type A (Tox A), Drs. Barbour and Mayer indicated that they would prefer to clone the Tax A gene in an HV2 Bacillus subtilis host-vector system (since one of the activities of Tox A is enhancement of the toxicity of E. colf endotoxin) but, if no HV2 B, subtilis host-vector system were available, they requested permission to clone the Tox A gene in an E K2 E. coil K-12 host-vector system. The RAC took this request under consideration at the September 25-26, 1980 meeting. The major determination for the RAC to make was whether Tox A is a \"potent toxin\" under Section I-D- 2 of the Guidelines. It was noted that the lethality of Tox A for animals is not great. The RAC by a vote of 17 in favor, none opposed, recommended that the cloning of the Tox A gene be permitted under P3 containment with either an HV2 B. subtilis or an EK2 E. col K-12 host-vector system. The scientists who submitted this request, noting that one of the activities of ToxA is enhancement of the toxicity of E. coil endotoxin, said they preferred to work in B. subtills rather than E.'coll77374 Federal Register I Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices if an HV2 B. subtilis host-vector system were available. Since an HV2 B. subtilis system is in fact now certified (see item m of this announcement) I am approving the cloning of the Staphylococcus aureus Tox A gene in an HV2 Bacillus subtilis host-vector system at P3 containment. Text has been added to Appendix E indicating this. VIII. Request for Permission to Transform Chlamydomonas Reinhardi With E. Coli/Saccraromyces Cerevisiae Plasmids. The RAC at its September 25-26, 1980 meeting considered similar requests from Dr. John Carbon of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Dr. Stephen Howell of the University of California, San Diego, to introduce E. coli-Saccharomyces cerevisiae hybrid plasmids containing defined DNA segments into Chlamydomonas P2 conditions. The host' is photosynthetic green algae. C. reinhardi is non-pathogenic, produces no known toxin, and is not known to exchange genetic information with other organisms. This proposal was published for comment in the Federal Register of August 21,1980. No comments were received during the thirty day period for comment. A motion to approve these experiments at the P2 level of containment was passed by a vote of 16 in favor, none opposed, and one absention. I accept this recommendation, and text has been added to Appendix E of the Guidelines indicating this. IX. Request For Permission To Transform Candida Albicans With E. Coli-S. Cerevisiae Plasmid. The following notice appeared in the Federal Register of August 21, 1980: Request for permission to transform Candida olbicans with E. coli-S cerevisiae plasimids. Dr. P. T. Magee of Michigan State University, and Dr. W. LaJean Chaffin of Texas Tech University, have requested consideration of the appropriate containment level for the return of Candida albicons DNA to the host of origin. The Candida albicans DNA will be cloned in E. coil K-12 or in Saccharomyces cerevisiae employing a hybrid plasmid vector derived from E. coll K- 12-S. cerevisioe or the yeast 2 micron plasmid. During the thirty day comment period, no responses were received. The RAC discussed this proposal at its September 25-26,1980 meeting. It was noted that Candida albicans is a normal inhabitant of the flora of man. It can be a pathogen in compromisedindividuals but does not produce a toxin. This is basically a return of DNA to host of origin type of experiment, with the intermediate host being either E. cali K-12 or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The RAC by a vote of 14 in favor, 1 opposed, and 3 absentions recommeded approval of this proposal at the P2 level of containment. I accept this recommendation, and text has been added to Appendix E of the Guidelines indicating this. X. Proposal To Transform Haemophilus Influenzae With E. Col/H. Influenzae Hybrid Plasmid The RAC at its September 25-26,1980 meeting considered a proposal from Dr. Hamilton Smith of the John Hopkins University to insert an E. coli TnlO tet gene into a naturally-occurring Haemophilus plasmid and to use the hybrid plasmid to transform H. influenzae Rd. a nonpathogenic strain. It was noted that a tetracycline resistance gene found naturally in Haemophilus is genetically related to the TnlO teti gene of E. coli. A motion to approve these experiments at the P1 level of containment was passed by a vote of 12 in favor, none opposed, with 7 abstentions. I accept this recommendation, and text has been added to Appendix E of the Guidelines indicating this. XI. Proposed Exemption For Streptococcus Sanguis And Streptococcus Pneumoniae A request submitted by Dr. Walter Guild of Duke University Medical Center that Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus pneumoniae be considered as natural exchangers of DNA under the exemption category of Section I-E-4 and Appendix A of the Guidelines was considered by the RAC. This proposal was published for comment in the Federal Register of August 21, 1980. No comments were received during the 30 day period for comment prior to the September 25-26, 1980 meeting. The evidence presented by the investigator demonstrated that these organisms exhange genetic material in both directions by the natural process of transformation. The RAC recommended by a vote of 16 in favor, none opposed, and 1 absention that a new sublist be added to Appendix A of the Guidelines exempting recombinant DNA experiments between Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus pneumonioe. I accept this recommendation and these two organisms have been added as sublist F of Appendix A.XII. Request For Permission To Incorporate Recombinant DNA In Zymomonas Mobilis The RAC considered a request from Drs. B. Montenecourt and D. Eveleigh of Rutgers University to permit the cloning of DNA derived from Pseudomonas strains that are non-pathogenic to animals or plants in an E. coli K-12 host, followed by transfer of the recombinant DNA into Zymomonas mobils. This proposal was published for comment in the Federal Register of August 21,1980. No comments were received during the 30 day comment period. The RAC by a vote of 17 in favor, none opposed and with no abstentions recommended approval at the P2 level of containment for the proposed experiments. I accept this recommendation, and text has been added to Appendix E of the Guidelines indicating this. XIII. Request To Transform Protoplasts of Streptosporangium With Recombinant DNA The RAC at its September 26, 1980 meeting considered a proposal to transform protoplasts of Streptosporangium with a hybrid plasmid containing pBR322 plus a Streptosporangium plasmid into which have been incorporated specified DNA segments from Streptomyces species or an HV1 approved Bacillus sqbtilis cloning vector. It was noted that members of the Streptosporangium genera are soil bacteria and have never been implicated in any human, animal, or plant diseases. Further, these nutritionally fastidious organisms have not been reported to produce toxins harmful to humans. The motion to approve these experiments at the P2 level of containment was passed by a vote of 17 in favor, none opposed, and I abstention. I accept this recommendation, and text has been added to Appendix E of the Guidelines indicating this. XIV. Proposed Revision of Subsections of Section II-C-1--e A notice appeared in the Federal Register of January 31,1980 concerning proposed revision of Section IU-C-1-e, and its subsections. It was recommended that Section I-C-1-e, III-C-1-e-(1), and III- C-1-e-(1}-(b], of the Guidelines be changed and that a new Section ll---1- e-(1)-(c be added. Section m-c-1-e-z2 would remain unchanged. The RAC, at its March 6-7,1980 meeting, recommended adoption of Section IIT-C-77375 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices 1-e, III-C--e-(1), and lI-C-1-e-1)-a] as published in the Federal Register of January 31, 1980, with certain modifications in Section I-C-1-e-{1]- (a). The Director, NIH, accepted this recommendation and promulgated the following sections in the Federal Register of April 14, 1980: \"III-C-1-e. All Viral Vectors. \"III-C,--e-). Other experiments involving eukaryotic virus vectors can be .done as follows: \"IIi-C-1-e-{)--(a]. Recombinant DNA- molecules containing no more than two-thirds of the genome of any eukaryotic virus [all viruses form'a single Family (36 being considered identical (50)1 maybe propagated d maintainea in cells in tissue culture using ,,- containment. For such experiments, it must be shown that the cells lack helper virus for the specific Families of defective viruses being used. The DNA may contain fragments of the genomes of viruses frommore than one Family but each fragment must be less thai two-thirds of the genome.\" At its March 6-7,1980 meeting, the RAC voted to defer consideration until the June 5-6, 1980 meeting of the new Sections m-C-1--e-(1)-(b] and IH-C-1- e-41J-(c) as proposed in the Federal Register of January 31, 1980, and- requested that a-working group develop additional information. Accordingly, a working group met on May 13,1980, during the annual meeting of the- American Society for Microbiology in Miami Beach, Florida. The report of the working group was considered briefly at the June 5-6,1980 RAC meeting when it was decided that it would be considered again by the RAG at its September 25- 26, 1980 meeting. The Working Group discussed the question of the appropriate containment' conditions for experiments involving recombinant DNA molecules containing less than two-thirds of the gehome of any eukaryotic virus which may be rescued with helper virus. On the basis 6f the consensus of the virologists, the following recommendation was proposed, as a revision of Section m1-C- 1-e-(1)-(b] of the Guidelines: \"III-C--e-1)-(b). Recombinants with less than two-thirds of the genome of any eukaryotic virus may be rescued with helper virus using P2 c6ntainmentif wild type strains of the virus are CDC Class 1 or 2 agents, or using P3 containment if wild type strains of the virus are CDC Class 3 agents(1).\" This proposal was published for comment in the Federal Register of August 21, 1980. During the thirty day comment period no responses were received. At the September 25-26, 1980 meeting, the RAC discussed this proposal again. Some members of the committeeexpressed concern whether the rescue of a defective recombinant virus with helper virus could result in the formation of a virus with an altered host specificity or increased pathogenicity. It was noted that the working group of, virologists previously discussed this point, and reached the conclusion that the recombinar t virus wold pose no greater biohazard than the wild type virus used as a helper. The consensus of the'working group was that the level of containment required for rescue of the recombinant virus should correspond to the same level of-biohazard as the helper virus as determined by the CDC classification. The motion to accept the proposed revision of subsection I1-C-1-e-(1)-(b) was passed by a vote of 10 in favor, 5 opposed, and I abstention. I accept this recommendation, and Section fII-G--e-(1)-(b) has been sol modified. This modification justifies two further changes in the Guidelines. First, new text has been added to Section I1I-. C-1 to advise the reader of the relationship of the subsections of-, Sections 11I-C-i-a, Ill-C-i-b, Iff-C---c, and ]II-C-1-d of the Guidelines to the subsections of Section III-C---e. Also, Table IV of the Guidelines has been eliminated. XV. Proposed Containment For Cloning Between Members of the Actinomycetes Group Dr. Dean Taylor of the Smith Kline and French Laboratories, proposed that the third entry in Appendix E of the Guidelines be modified to read: P2 physical containment shall be used for DNA recombinants produced between members of the Actinomycetes group except for those species which are known to be pathogenic for man, animals, or plants. This proposal was made previously by the RAC Working Group on Prokaryotic Host-Vectors Other Than E. coft and appeared in the Federal Register, April 13,1979 (44 FR 2Z316). The RAC -considered the.proposal at its May 21- 23, 1979 meeting and rdcommended to' restrict this so that it did not include the entire Actinomycetes group but rather only the genera Streptomyces and Micromonospora..The Director, NIH, accepted this recommendation and the action was published in the Federal Register, July 20, 1979 (44 FR 42916), and appears as the third entry in Appendix E of the Guidelines. This proposal was published for comment in the Federal Registerof August 21, 1980. During the 30 day comment period, no comments were received.During the RAC discussion of this proposal it was noted that the family of Actinomycetes include many genera that are not pathogenic for man, animals, or plants. The microorganisms in this group are mainly found in soil, and are of medical and industrial importance. They produce ninety percent of the antibiotics used in medicime. Although some members of the group are parasitic, most do not cause disease, or are marginal pathogens. A motion to restrict the proposal to members of the Actinomycetes group which are known riot to be pathogenic for man, animals, or plants, failed by a vote of 3 in favor, 11 opposed, with 3 abstentions. A motion to accept the proposal as published in the Federal Register on August 21,1980, passed by a voteof 16 in favor, 1 opposed, with 1 abstention. I accept this recommendation, and the third entry in Appendix E of the Guidelines has been so amended XVI. Changes in Registration Requirements Dr. Maxine Singer, National Cancer institute, National Institutes of Health, proposed a series of changes in the administrative requirements specified by the Guidelines. The proposal would elimnate NIH review, registration, and approval for all experiments assigned containment conditions in the Guidelines. In submitting the proposal, Dr. Singer stated: When the Guidelines were first promulgated, many arguments appeared to dictate a complex system of review and approval prior to the initiation of experiments. Regardless of how one views the wisdom of the earlier decisions, the multi- level system with its emphasis on central review at the NIH is now clearly unnecessary, inhibitory, expensive, and conterproductive in relation to the respect accorded the containment recommendatlions. By now, Institutional Biosafety Committees have accumulated sufficient expelence with. and knowledge of the Guidelines to operate as independent review groups. Safety Officers now function in many research institutions. Furthermore, the good laboratory practices mandated by the Guidelines have become routine practice in many laboratories. Indeed, confidence in the efficiacy of Guidelines has been based primarily on compliance by individual investiators within their own laboratories. The administrative changes that accompanied the revised containment levels for experiments with E. coli K-12 and S. cerevisiae earlier this year recognized that central review and approval were no longer necessaryily desirable or useful. The present proposal is an extension of that idea. In brief, the proposal eliminates central review, registration, and approval for all737677376 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices experiments assigned containment conditions in the Guidelines. Investigators would be required to notify their Institutional Biosafety Committees prior to 'the initiation of experiments and those committees would be responsible for reviewing the registration documents for consistency with the provisions of the Guidelines and advising the investigators of necessary changes. No Memoranda of Understanding would be required. IBCs and investigators would still be expected to petition the ORDA regarding experiments not explicitly covered by the Guidelines, experiments requiring case-by- cai-e review and experiments involving exceptions to the provisions {or prohibitions). The NIH and the RAC would function as policy making elements with responsibility to change the Guidelines as required, to evaluate containment requirements for experiments not explicitly covered by the Guidelines, and for consideration of exceptions. Seven years have passed since the scientific community first raised questions regarding recombinant DNA experiments. The ignorance of those early years has been supplanted with a wealth of experience and information. Just as the early stringent Guidelines were promptly adopted in response to the ignorance, we must now respond just as promptly to the current more realistic appraisals. The proposed revisions were published in the Federal Register of August 21, 1980, for comment, as Item 8 of the notice. Specific changes were proposed in many different places in the Guidelines, specified under subheadings \"A\" through \"X' within Item 8. Seventeen letters were received commenting on the proposal. Sixteen commentators supported its adoption. One commentator stated: Maxine Singer's initiative (Federal Register, August 21, 1980) to have the NIH Guidelines fall primarily under local control is both wise and timely. Decisions about scientific research are best left to the investigtors both for efficiency and as a matter of fundamental principle. Only in exigency, should this ideal be violated. Perhaps we've passed through such an occasion with R-DNA research. However, it is now the time to return to the more normal situation. Since work with recombinant DNA has proven to be very safe and very important, dual review at the national and local levels serves no good purpose. As one involved from the beginning in the R-DNA issue, I've always felt that the 'Guidelines' should be guidelines; they turned into regulations. With the proposed change, they will revert and also the unfortunate quasi-regulatory role that the NIH has had to play will begin to disappear. Another commentator said: I think the IBC mechanism has proven its effectiveness in interpreting and enforcing the letter and intent of the Guidelines governing recombinant DNA research. I do not see how the practices of submission, obtaining and recording, etc., of MUA's particularly therequirements for annual submissions of MUA's fi-r each continuing NIH grant or for applications for new grants, contributes to the safely of research. An updated statement of work in progress from each investigator to the IBC's would be significantly simpler to administer and would ensure as much real safety as the present system. Another observed: I agree with her that the function of review. registration, and monitoring of research workers falling into categories explicitly mentioned in the Guidelines can be effectively administered by the local Institutional Biosafety Committees. This would reduce the workload for ORDA allowing it to spend more time determining policy and revising the Guidelines according to requests or to new data. It would simultaneously ease the bureaucratic workload for the researcher without jeopardizing the effectiveness of the Guidelines. Not only are the procedures described in the Guidelines now standard practice among most laboratories, as pointed out by Dr. Singer. but I feel that the local Institutional Biosafety Committees are in much better position to evaluate compliance with the Guidelines. Because of their past experience with the Guidelines, I feel that these committees are ideally suited to take over this important administrative role. One commentator made the following observation about Institutional Biosafety Committees: Institutional Biosafety Committees clearly seem able to operate as independent review groups, and the laboratory practices set forth in the Guidelines have now become part of the standard operating procedures of laboratories working in the field. In other fields of biological research, safety procedures are implemented entirely at the local level, even when known biohazards are involved. It is no longer necessary to have a unique multi-level system in an area where seven years of extensive experience has shown the absence of a unique hazard. Another commentator said the following about central review: Elimination of central review at NIH for experiments classified in the Guidelines will save a great deal of time for both the investigator and the reviewers at NIH. I believe the experience of the past six years justifies a change toward an administrative arrangement long successfully practiced in the handling of proven microbial pathogens, namely national guidelines enforced by local biosafety committees. One commentator made the following observation about the current system of NIH review: The present complex system of review on both local and Federal levels is no longer necessary. It Is wasteful of time, effort, and money. It is, in fact. counterproductive because bureaucratic requirements seen by investigators to be clearly unnecessary lead to disrespect for regulations that should be respected. Institutional Biosafety Committees should, in my opinion, be fully capable ofmonitoring laboratory practices and containment levels specified by the Guidelines. Another letter included the following remark: I strongly endorse the proposed changes because I believe that the risks of this research are now clearly minimal and because the bureaucracy and.consequent wasted time are truly detrimental to progress in an area that promises to be of great benefit to mankind. The Chairman of one lMC reporting the unanimous endorsement of his committee stated: We feel strongly that safety is solely a function of the effectiveness of the local institutional practices, on the part of the Prs and the IEC. in complying with and enforcing the Guidelines. The submission of MUAs adds nothing but expensive and time- consuming paperwork. The one letter against the proposal stated the following: At present, we do not believe that there are good reasons for changing the registration requirements. Although present procedures demand some extra paperwork, they permit centralized keeping of files which could be of significant use in reviewing the extent of work on recombinant DNA and its possible hazards. Somebody should know what is going on. The RAC discussed the proposal at length at its September 25-26,1980 meeting. Dr. Singer, who atteided this portion of the meeting, summarized the proposal and presented her arguments for adopting it. It was noted that the proposal has two major aspects, which could be acted upon separately. The first aspect is that it would eliminate NIH review of protocols for which containment levels are specified by the Guidelines. The second aspect is that the proposal would eliminate the requirement for pre-review by the local EBC prior to initiation of all experiments for which containment levels are specified by the Guidelines (Prior review is already not required for most experimentsl. Some members of the RAC felt that adoption of the proposal should be delayed until a broad-based survey of the functioning of IBCs is completed. Some members of the RAC felt that pre-review of all experiments by the IBC should not be eliminated at the present time. The RAC then voted separately on a four-part motion proposed by Dr. Gottesman. The RAC voted 15 in favor, 3 opposed. with no abstentions, to eliminate the requirement for NIH review of IBC decisions on any experiments for which containment levels are specified in the Guidelines. The RAC voted 12 in favor, 5 opposed with 1 abstention, to defer consideration77377 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices of eliminating pre-review of experiments by the IBCs until the frequency of principal investigator error in selecting the appropriate containment levels has been determined. The RAC voted 17 in favor, none opposed, with 1 abstention, that IBCs keep records of recombinant DNA research done in their institution, including a record of the frequency of errors in classificaion of experiments by the principal investigator. The RAC voted 15 in favor, 3 opposed, with no abstentions, that IBCs no longer need'register with NI-f recombinant DNA experiments for which containment levels are specified in the Guidelines. I accept these recommendations. The four-part motion passed by the RAC indicated the intent of the RAC to recomment acceptance of certain concepts in the proposal by Maxine Singer (i.e., elimination of the requirement for IBC registration with, and NIH review of, experiments for which the containment levels -are specified in the Guidelines), but to defer recommendation of other concepts (i.e., the proposal to eliminate pre-review by the EBC for these experiments].' As noted earlier, th'e proposal by Maxine Singer published as Item 8 in the Federal Register of August 21, 1980, consisted of proposed-changes in many different places of the Guidelines, specified under subheadings \"A\" to- \"X\". Following the RAG rieeting, I asked a four-person group to revise these proposed changes in order to translate the four-part general motion of the RAG into specific, Guideline changes. The group (consisting of Dr. Bernard Talbot, my Special Assistant, Dr. William Gartland, Director of the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, Dr.. Maxine Singer, originator of the proposal, and Dr. Susan.Gottesman, RAC member and originator of the four- part motionpassed by the RAC) - unanimously agreed on wording which translates the intent of the RAG into specific changes in the Guidelines. I have accepted their recommendatfons. The result is that some of the changes \"A\" through \"X\" originally proposed by Dr. Singer have been accepted as proposed; some have been rejected, thereby leaving the relevant portions of the Guidelines unchanged; and some have been further modified so that particular sections now are different- from both the Guidelines-prior to the: Singer proposal and from the Singer proposal. Specifically, the sections where the changes proposed by Dr. Singer have been accepted are: \"E\"-Deletion of of Sections IV-F-1 and IV-F-2. The proposed changes which have been rejected thus leaving the .. Gudelines.as they were previous to the Singer proposal are: \"Q\"--Heading of Section IV-D-5-d; \"R\"-Heading of Section IV-D-5-e; and \"T\"-Proposed deletion of Section IV-E-1-b-(3)-(e). The proposed changes which have been further modified so that the sections now read differently from the Guidelines prior to the Singer proposal and from the Singer proposal are: \"A- Section III; \"B\"-Section M-O; \"C\"- IV-F--4, and VI-C, dealing with registration, have been eliminated, as has the proposed Section IV-D--5-e-(6). One consequence of these changes is that MUAs need-no longer be filed with NIH and the term \"MUA\" has been deleted from the Guidelines. One part of the RAG four-part motion called for BCs to keep records of recombinant DNA research done in their institution, including a record of the frequency of errors in classification of experiments by the principal investigator. This requirement for record keepingwill be specified in the revision of the Administrative Practice Supplement to the NIH Guidelines to be issued. in November 1980. During the-RAC discussion, the concept of requiring the IBCs to report annually to.NIH on all recombinant DNA research being done at the institution, was rejected. NIH is sponsoringa meeting of IBG Chairmen on November 24-25,1980. The issue of possibly reporting annually to NIH will be discussed at that meeting. Following that discussion, I will agaimreview this issue. It should be emphasized that NIH remains responsible for specifying containment conditions for all experiments not explicitly covered by the Guidelines. Tifs includes experiments requiring case-by-case review and exceptions to the provisions. or prohibitions of the Guidelines. Principal investigators must petitionNIH for consideration of such proposed experiments. NIH will follow existing procedures in such cases and will notify the principal investigators as before. No such experiments are to be approved by the IBCs until containment conditions have been set by the NIH. No such experiments are to be initiated by Pia until appropriate registration documents have been submitted to and approved by the IBC. The registration documents should include the NIH statement of containment conditions. XVIL Procedures For Review of Large- Scale Experiments Section I-D-6 of the Guidelines prohibits \"large-scale experiments (e.g., more than 10 liters of culture) with organisms containing recombinant DNA's, unless the recombinant DNAs are rigorously characterized and the absence of harmful sequences established.\" Section IV-E--1-b-(3)-(d) of the Guidelines states that the Director, NIH, is responsible for \"authorizing under procedures specified by the RAC, large- scale experiments (i.e., more than 10 liters of culture) for recombinant DNAs that are rigorously characterized and free of harmful sequences.\" Part VI of the Guidelines, \"Voluntary Compliance,\" encourages institutions not otherwise covered by the Guidelines to follow the standards and procedures set forth in the Guidelines. At its September 1979 meeting, the RAC adopted the following procedures to be followed by applicants proposing to exceed the 10-liter limit: ' \"Application Procedures for Large- Scale Recombinant DNA Experiments \"1. For each research project proposing to exceed the 10-liter limit, the applicant shall file a request with the NIH Office of Recombinant DNA Activities (ORDA). The request should include the following information:\"a. The Memorandum of Understanding and Agreement (MUA) submitted to the local Institutional Biosafety Committee. The MUA should include, or have appended to it, a summary paragraph which describes the proposed project in language that is comprehensible to nion-specialists. \"b. A statement of the rationale for wishing to exceed the 10-liter limit.\"c. A specification of the total volume ofthe fermenter to be used. \"d. Evidence that the recombinant DNAs to be employed in the research have been rigorously characterized and are free of harmful sequences.\"e. A description of the applicant's laboratory practices, containment equipment, and facilities relevant to the containment of large volumes of culture.I I77378 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices \"f.

' These procedures may be refined or revised on the basis of discussion and action by the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee.\" At recent RAC meetings, there have been extensive discussions of the role of the RAC and NIH in the review of large- scale proposals submitted by industry. (Minutes of RAC meetings are available from ORDA.) At the June 1980 meeting, the RAC passed a motion by a vote of seventeen to zero with one abstention that the following proposal be published in the Federal Register for consideration at the September 1980 meeting: \"The following procedures should be adopted for approval of requests to grow greater than 10 liters of organisms containing recombinant DNA. The RAC will determine if a given recombinant DNA-containing strain is rigorously characterized and the absence of harmful sequences established. Such a determination shall include specification of the containment level (P--LS). These determinations should not in any way be construed as RAC certification of safe laboratory procedures for industry scale-up. Adherence to the specified containment conditions is the responsibility of the local IBC.\" This proposal was published for comment in the Federal Register of August 21,1980. There it was pointed out that if the proposal were accepted, itwould have the effect of changing the application procedures to read as follows: \"Application Procedures for Large- Scale Recombinant DNA Experiments \"1. For each research project proposing to exceed the 10-liter limit, the applicant shall file a request with the NIH Office of Recombinant DNA Activities (ORDA). The request should irtclude the following information:\"a. The Memorandum of Understanding and Agreement (MUA) submitted to the local Institutional Biosafety Committee. The MUA should include, or have appended to it. a summary paragraph which describes the proposed project in language that is comprehensible to non-specialists. \"b. A statement of the rationale for wishing to exceed the 10-liter limit.\"c. Evidence that the recombinant DNAs to be employed in the research have been rigorously characterized and are free of harmful sequences. \"d. Specification of the P-LS level proposed to be usea as defined in the NIH Physical Containment Recommendations for Large-Scale Uses of Organisms Containing Recombinant DNA Molecules. (Federal Register, April 11,1980). \"2. Each request submitted to ORDA shall be referred to a working group of the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee for review. \"3. Following review and approval by the working group, each request shall be submitted to the entire Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee for review. \"4. Following review and approval by the RAC, each request shall be submitted to the Director, NIH, for final review. \"5. Applications for large-scale experiments which are submitted by institutions not receiving NIH funds for recombinant DNA research shall be kept confidential (provided the institutions so desire) in accordance with the provisions of the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules. \"These procedures may be refined or revised on the basis of discussion and action by the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee.\" During the comment period, two comments were received. One commentator stated: I regret that the RAC wishes to terminate its reviews of engineering plans for proposed private-sector DNA operations. Another letter stated: -We agree with the RAC proposal passed in June 1980. to exclude regulatory functions dealing with industrial scale-up. We believe that the current mission of the RAC Isappropriate and that its present constitution. representing scientific and public interests, is not well suited for a regulatoey role. Other bodies of the federal government already have the mandate to carry out regulatory functions and should acquire necessary resources and expertise. The proposal was discussed at length at the September 25-26,1980 RAC meeting. Dr. Krimsky said that although at previous RAC meetings he had argued strongly for proposals like this, he had now changed his mind. because he had come to realize that such pre-review as the RAC has been performing is unique, and that no other agency would conduct such a review. He proposed, as an alternative proposal, that there be established a subcommittee of the RAC made up of some members of the RAC and some members of NIH staff with expertise in facilities and technologies. and that the subcommittee request representation from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the Center for Disease Control (CDC). and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA]. In this proposal, the subcommittee would review engineering and technology, and its review would be transmitted directly to the Director, NIH. After discussion, this alternative motion was withdrawn from consideration for the time being, with the understanding that it would be reconsidered later in the meeting. During further discussion of the proposal as published in the Federal Register of August 21,1980, Dr. Fedoroff indicated her support for eliminating RAC review of the details of physical containment for individual large-scle proposals, as is already the case for small.scale research. Dr. King indicated her support of the proposal as an acceptable compromise. Following further discussion, the RAC voted 12 in favor, 5 opposed, with one abstention, to adopt the proposal as published in the Federal Register of August 21, 1980. I accept this recommendation and procedures for its implementation are published at the end of this section. Later in the meeting, Dr. Krimsky introduced the following motion to establish a large-scale review subcommittee: \"An industrial review subcommittee of the RAC shall be established with the responsibility for advising the Director on procedures and facilities design pertaining to applications for large-scale operations. \"After the full RAG has reviewed the biological containment requirements for77379 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices a large-scale proposal, the subcommittee shall examine the applicant's plans for -large-scale operations and issue recommendations to the Director on plant design, health surveillance and environmental monitoring. The Director shall advise institutions of recommended design parameters and operational procedures. The determination shall not be construed as NIH certification of industrial operations. \"The subcommittee shall invite participation from NIH's biosafety staff plus OSHA, NIOSH, CDC, FDA, EPA, and USDA.\" Dr. Fedoroff expressed concern about delays if first the full RAC and then subsequently a subcommittee were to be involved in the review process. Others agreed. Dr. Gottesman said that she was opposed to continuation of review of equipment design in individual applications by either the full RAC or subcommittee. Dr. Logan of OSHA, speaking in behalf of the proposal,-said that the delays need not be serious and that such subcommittee r~view would be beneficial. He said that OSHA does not have the legal authority to conduct pre-review of applications. Dr. Campbell said that while he opposed'a subcommittee doing pre-review of individual applications, he favored a subcommittee to prepare future. revisiohs of the Physical Containment Recbmmendations for Large-Scale Uses of Organisms Containing Recombinant DNA Molecules (i.e., the definitions of Pl-LS, etc.) and to monitor how well the system is working. Dr. Gottesman proposed an-amendment to Dr. Krimsky's motion to establish the subcomm ittee with these functions, but to dono pre-review of individual applications. An amendment to this amendment proposed by Dr. Krimsky to include subcommittee pre-review of '' individual applications failed by a vote of 3 in favor, 15 opposed, with no abstentions. After further amendments were adopted, the RAC passed the following motion by a vote of 15 in favor, 2 opposed, with 1 abstention: \"A large-scale review subcommittee of the RAC shall be established with the responsibility for advising the RAC on procedures and facilities design pertainipg to large-scale operations, and on the performance of local IBCs in reviewing physical containment facilities. \"The subcommittee shall invite participation from NIH's biosafety staff plus OSHA, NIOSI!, CDC, FDA, EPA, and USDA.\" I agree with the establishment of a group to report to the RAC on recommendations for future'revisions ofthe Physical Containment Recommendations for Large-Scale Uses of Organisms Containing Recombinant DNA Molecules (i.e., the definitions of PI-LS, etc.) and on the performance of local IBCs in reviewing large-scale physical containment facilities. A Workidg Group of the RAC was established at the May 1979 meeting to develop the Physical Containment Recommendations for Large-Scale Uses of Organisms Containing Recombinant DNA Molecules. These recommenditionswere reviewed at the December 1979 and March 1980 RAC Meetings before being published in the Federal Register on April 11, 1980. Establishing a new \"subcommittee\" of the RAC to deal with this issue would require a formal change in the RAC Charter. Therefore, I favor reconstitution of the current RAC \"Working Group\" for this purpose. As noted above (see item IV of this announcement), the RAC has recommended that RAC \"members should be chosen to provide expertise in fermentation technology, engineering, and other aspects of large-scale production.\" I expect that an individual with these qualifications will shortly be -appointed. When this happens, I will ask that the appointee consult with the RAC Chairman and that together they decide on which additional RAC niembers should be appointed to the. reconstituted Large-Scale Review Working Group. The RAC recommended that participation be invited from \"NIH's biosafety staff plus OSHA, NIOSH, CDC, FDA, EPA, and USDA.\" Ideally, all Federal agencies with representatives on the RAC should be invited to participate in the deliberations of the Working Group. In accordance with the recommendation of the RAC, the Working Group will not be involved in pre-review of-individual applications. To assist in its function of advising the RAC on the performance of local IBCs in reviewing physical containment facilities and on future revisions.of the Large-Scale Physical Containment Recommendations, the Working Group may request information from individual companies. Since NIH is not a regulatory agency, the intent of any such information collection will be fact- finding, to help in development of general recommendations from the Working Group to the RAC, and not for purposes of regulatory actions directed at individual companies. In response to recommendations of the RAC, the revised application- procedures for large-scale proposals are- now promulgated as final, i.e.:\"Application Procedures for Large- Scale Recombinant DNA Experiments. \"1. For each research project proposing to exceed the 10-liter limit, the applicant shall file a request with the NIH Office of Recombinant DNA Activities (ORDA]. The request should include the following information:\"a. The registration document submitted to the local Institutional Biosafety Committee. This should include, or have appended to it, a summary paragraph which describes the proposed project in language that is comprehensible to non-specialists. \"b. A statement of the rationale for wishing to exceed the 10-1iter limit. .\"c. Evidence that the recombinant DNAs to be employed in the research have been rigorously characterized an4 are free of harmful sequences. \"d.

Following review and approval by the working group, each request shall be submitted to the entire Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee for review. \"4. Following review and approval by the RAC, each request shall be submitted to the Director, NIH, for final review. \"5. Applications for large-scale experiments which are submitted by institutions riot receiving NIH funds for recombinant DNA research shall be kept confidential (provided the institutions so desire) in accordance with the provisions of the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules and to the extent permitted by law. \"These procedures may be refined or revised on the basis of discussion and action by the NIH ReCombinant DNA Advisory Committee.\" These application procedures are identical to those published for comment on August 21, 1980, except for the elimination of the term \"Memorandum of Understanding and Agreement,\" its replacement by the term \"registration document,\" and addition of the clause\"and to the extent permitted by law\" in paragraph 5. As discussed above (in item XVI of this announcement), the term \"Memorandum of Understanding and Agreement\" has been eliminated from the Guidelines. The revised Guidelines, in Section III, describe the77380 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices required contents of a registration document. The revised \"Application Procedures for Large-Scale Recombinant DNA Experiments\" differ from the previous version (adopted at the September 1979 RAC meeting) in requiring that the application specify a \"P-LS\" level at which the work will be done, rather than requiring individual details of physcial containment. In other respects the Application Procedures adopted at the September 1979 RAC meeting remain' identical in the revised Application Procedures promulgated today. As noted in the minutes of the September 6-7, 1979 RAC meeting, review of each large- scale proposal by the RAC, \"might be at a meeting, but it also might be through mail ballot.\" This option will be retained. Additional Announcements of the Director, NIH Section IV-E-1-b-(3)-(d) of the Guidelines gives responsibility to the Director, NIH. for \"authorizing, under procedures specified by the RAC, large- scale experiments (i.e., involving more than 10 liters of culture] for recombinant DNAs that are rigorously characterized and free of harmful sequences.\" Acordingly, several requests for authorization to culture, on a large- scale, recombinant DNA host-vector systems have been received and reviewed by the NIH. I. Genentech, Inc. On November 4, 1980, the Director, NIH, on the recommendation of the RAC, approved a request from Genentech, Inc., for the large-scale culture up to 750 liters of EKI host- vector systems containing plasmids into which have been ligated cDNA coding for human leukocyte interferons. This request was approved with the understanding that Genentech, Inc., has agreed to permit an observer, designated by NIH, to visit the facilities if NIH should choose to inspect the site. The principal investigators are Drs. Michael Ross and Norm S. C. Lin. The work is to be done at the PI-LS level of containment at the research and development facility at 460 Point San Bruno Boulevard, South San Francisco, California 94080. II. Burns-Biotec Laboratories, Inc. On November 4, 1980, the Director, NIH, approved requests from Burns- Biotec Laboratories, Inc., a wholly- owned subsidiary of Schering Corporation, for large-scale culture of EK1 host-vector systems containing plasmids coding for human leukocyte interferon, and certain derivativesthereof, in a 1000 liter fermentor (up to 750 liter working volume) at the PI-LS level of containment. The request was approved with the understanding that Burns-Biotec Laboratories, Inc., has agreed to permit an observer, designated by NIH, to visit the facilities if NIH should choose to inspect the site. The principal investigator for this project is Dr. Donald E. Baldwin. The large-scale growth of the organisms is to be carried out at plant facilities located in Elkhorn, Nebraska. Dated: November 14,1980. Donald S. Fredrickson, Director National Institutes of Health. OMB's \"Mandatory Information Requirements for Federal Assistance Program Announcements\" (45 FR 39592) requires a statement concerning the official goverinent programs contained in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. Normally NIH lists in its announcements the number and title of affected individual programs for the guidance of the public. Because of the guidance in this notice covers not only virtually every NIH program but also essentially every federal research program in which DNA recombinant molecule techniques could be used. it has been determined to be not cost effective or in the public interest to attempt to list tlese programs. Such a list would likely require several additional pages. In addition. NIH could not be certain that every federal program would be included as mitny federal agencies, as well as private organizations, both national and international, have elected to follow the NIH Guidelines. In lieu of the individual program listing, NIH invites readers to direct questions to the information address above about whether individual programs listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance are affected. NIH programs are not covered by OMB Circular A-95 because they fit the description of \"programs not considered appropriate\" in Section 8-{b)-4) and (5) Circular. 80-36S Filkd 11-20-W, &45 am] BILLING CODE 4110-M-U77381 Friday November 21, 1980 Part VIi Department of Health and Human Services National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, November 1980 Federal.

Scope of the Guidelines I-A. Purpose. The purpose of these Guidelines is to specify practices for constructing and handling (i) recombinant DNA molecules and (ii) organisms and viruses containing recombinant DNA molecules. I-B. Definition of Recombinant DNA Molecules. In the context of these Guidelines, recombinant DNA molecules are defined as either (i) molecules which are constructed outside living cells by joining natural or synthetic DNA segments to DNA molecules that can replicate in a living cell, or (ii) DNA molecules that result from the republication of those described in (I) above. I-C. GeneralApplicability. See Section IV-B. I-D. Prohibitions. The following experiments are nut to be initiated at the present time: ) I-D-1. Formation of recombinant DNAs derived from the pathogenic organisms classified (1) as Class 4 or 5 (2) or from cells known (2A) to be infected with such agents, regardless of the host-vector system used. I-D-2. Deliberate formation of recombinant DNAs containing genes for the biosynthesis of toxins potent for vertebrates (2A) (e.g., botulinum or diphtheria toxins; ienoms from insects, snakes, etc.). I-D-3. (Deleted). I-D-4. Deliberate release into the environment of any organism containing recombinant DNA. I-D--5. Deliberate transfer of a drug resistance trait to microorganisms that are not known to acquire it naturally, if such acquisition could compromise the use of a drug to control disease agents In human or veterinary medicine or agriculture. (2A) I-D-6. Large-scale experiments (e.g., more than 10 liters of culture) with organisms containing recombinant DNAs, unless the recombinant DNAs are rigorously characterized and the absence of harmful sequences established (a). (See Section IV-E-1-b- (3]-(d).) I-D (1-6). Experiments in Categories I-D--1 to I-D-6 may be expected (4) from the prohibitions (and will at that time be assigned appropriate levels of physical and biological containment) provided that these experiments are expressly77384 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices approved by the Director, National Institutes of Health (NIH), with advice of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC), after appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment. (See Section IV-E-1-b--1]- (e).) Experiments in Categories I-D-l, I-D- 2, I-D--5, and experiments involving \"wild type\" host-vector systems are excepted from the prohibitions, provided that these experiments are designed for risk-assessment purposes and are conducted within the NIH high- containment facilities located in Building 41-T on the Bethesda campus and in Building 550 located at the Frederick Cancer Research Center. The selection of laboratory practices and containment equipment for such experiments shall be approved by the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities (ORDA) following consultation with the RAC Risk Assessment Subcommittee and the NIH Biosafety Committee. ORDA shall inform RAC members of the proposed risk-assessment projects at the same time it seeks consultation from the RAC Risk Assessment Subcommittee and the NIH Biosafety Committee. If a major biohazard is determined, the clones will be destroyed after the completion of the experiment rather than retaining them in the high containment facility. Other clones that are non-hazardous or not of major hazard will be retained in the high containment. I-E. Eemptions. It must be emphasized that the following exemptions (4) are not meant to apply to experiments described in the Sections I- D-1 to I-D-5 as being prohibited. In addition, any recombinant DNA molecules involving DNA from Class 3 organisms (1) or cells known to be infected with these agents, or any recombinant DNA inolecules which increase the virulence and host-range of a plant pathogen beyond that which occurs by natural genetic exchange, are not exempt unless specifically so designated by NIH under Section I-E-5. The following recombinant DNA molecules are exempt from these Guidelines, and no registration with NIH is necessary:. I-E-1. Those.that are not in organisms or viruses. (5) I-E-2. Those that consist entriely of DNA segments from a single nonchromosomal or viral DNA source, though one or more of the segments may be a synthetic equivalent. I-E-3. Those that consist entirely of DNA from a prokaryotic host, including its indigenous plasmids or viruses, when propagated only in that host (or a closely related strain of the samespecies) or when transferred to another host by well established physiological means; also those that consist entirely of DNA from a eukaryotic host, including its chloroplasts, mitochondria, or plasmids (but excluding viruses), when propagated only in that host (or a closely related strain of the some species). I-E-4. Ceratin specified recombinant DNA molecules that consist entirely of DNA segments from different species that exchange DNA by known physiological processes, though one or more of the segments may be a synthetic equivalent. A list of such exchangers will be prepared and periodically revised by the Director, NIH, with advice of the RAC, after appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment. (See Section IV-E-1-b-(1)- (d).) Certain classes are exempt as of publication of these Revised Guidelines. The list is in Appendix A. An updated list may be obtained from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20205. I-E-5. Other classes of recombinant DNA molecules, if the Director, NIH, with advice of the RAC, after appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment, finds that they do not present a significant risk to health or the environment. (See Section IV-E-1-b- (1}-{d).) Certain classes are exempt as of publication of these Revised Guidelines. The list is in Appendix C. An updated list may be obtained from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, 20205. I-F. General Definitions. See section IV-C. II. Containment Effective biological safety programs have been 9perative in a variety of laboratories for many years. Considerable information, therefore, already exists for the design of physical containment facilities and the selection of laboratory procedures applicable to organisms carrying recombinant DNAs. (6-19) The existing programs rely upon mechanisms that, for convenience, can be divided into two categories: (i) a set of standard practices that are generally used in microbiological laboratories, and (ii) special procedures, equipment, and laboratory installations that provide physical barriers which are applied in varying degrees according to the estimated biohazard. Experiments on recombinant DNAs, by their very nature, lend themselves to a third containment mechanism- namely, the application of highly specific biological barriers. In fact.natural barriers do exist which limit either (i) the infectivity of a vector, or vehicle, (plasmid or virus) for spedific hosts or (ii) its dissemination and survival in the environment. The vectors that provide the means for replication of the recombinant DNAs and/or the host cells in which they replicate can be genetically designed to decrease by many orders of magnitude the probability of dissemination of recombinant DNAs outside the laboratory. As these three means of containment are complementary, different levels of containment appropriate for experiments with different recombinants can be established by applying various combinations of the physical and biological barriers along with a constant use of the standard practices. We consider these categories of containment separately here in order that such combinations can be conveniently expressed in the Guidelines. In constructing these Guidelines, it was necessary to define boundary conditions for the different levels of physical and biological containment and for the classes of experiments to which they apply. We recognize that these definitions do not take into account all existing and anticipated information on special procedures that will allow particular experiments to be carried out under different conditions than indicated here without affecting risk. Indeed. we urge that individual investigators devise simple and more effective containment procedures and that investigators and institutuional biosafety committees recommend changes in the Guidelines to permit their use. H-A. Standard Practices and Training. The first principle of containment is a strict adherence to good microbiological practices. (6-15) Consequently, all personnel directly or indirectly involved in experiments on recombinant DNAs must receive adequate instruction. (see Sections IV- D---g, IV-D-5-d and IV-D-8-b.). This shall, as a minimum, include instructions in aseptic techniques and in the biology of the organisms used in the experiments, so that the potential biohazards can be understood and appreciated. Any research group working with agents with a known or potential biohazard shall have an emergency plan which describes the procedures to be followed if an accident contaminates personnel or the environment. The principal investigator must ensure that everyone in the laboratory is familiar with both the potential hazards of the77385 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices work and the emergency plan. (See Sections IV-D-5-e and IV-D-3-d.) If a research group is working with a known pathogen where there is an effective vaccine it should be made available to all workers. Where serological monitoring is clearly appropriate it shall be provide. (See Sections IV-D-1-h and IV-D-8-c.) 11-B. Physical Containment Levels. The objective of physical containment is to confine organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules, and thus to reduce the potential for exposure of the laboratory worker, persons outside of the laboratory, and the environment to organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules. Physical containment is achieved through the use of laboratory practices, containment equipment, and special laboratory design. Emphasis is placed on primary means of physical containment which are provided by laboratory practices and containment equipment. Special laboratory design provides a secondary means of protection against the accidental release of organisms outside the laboratory or to the 'environment. Special laboratory design is used primarily in facilities in which experiments of moderate to high potential hazardsare performed. Combinations of laboratory practices, containment equipment, and special laboratory design can be made to achieve different levels of physical containment. Four levels of physical containment, which are designated as P1, P2, P3, and P4, are described. It should be emphasized that the descriptions and assignments of physical-containment detailed below are based on existing approaches to containment of pathogenic organisms. For example, the \"Classification of Etiologic Agents on the Basis of Hazard,\"(7) prepared by the Cefiters for Disease Control, describes four general levels which roughly correspond to our descriptions for P1, P2, P3, and P4; and the National Cancer Institute describes three levels for'research on'oncogenic viruses which roughly correspond to-our P2, P3, and P4 levels.(8] It is recognized that'several different combinations of laboratory practices, containment equipment, and special laboratory design may be appropriate for containment of specific research activities. The Guidelines, therefore, allow alternative selections of primary, containment equipment within facilities that have been designed to provide P3 and P4 levels of physical containment. The selection of alternative methods of primary containment is dependent, however, on the level of biological containment provided by the host-vectorsystem .used in the experiment. Consideration will also be given by the Director, NIH, with the advice of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee to other combinations which achieve an equivalent level of containment. (See Section IV-E-1-b-(2)-(b).) Additional material on physical containment for plant host-vector systems is found in Sections III-C-3 and 111-C-4. -II-B-1. P1 Level. Il-B-i-a.

Biological Containment. II-D-1. Levels of Biological Containment. In consideration of biological containment, the vector (plasmid, organelle, or virus) for therecombinant DNA and the host (bacterial, plant, or animal cell) in which the vector is propagated in the laboratory will be considered together. Any combination of vector and host which'is to provide biological containment must be chosen or constructed so that the following-types of \"escape\" are minimized: (i) survival of the vector in its host outside the laboratory and (ii) transmission of the vector from the propagation host to other nonlaboratory hosts. The following levels of biological containment (-V, or Host-Vector, systems) for prokaryotes will be established; specific criteria will depend on the organisms to be used. Eukaryotic host-vector systems are considered in i Part m. - II-D-i-a. HVI. A host-vector system which provides a moderate level of contaimnent. Specific systems: II-D-1-a-(1). EK1. The host is always E. coll K-12 or a derivative thereof, and the vectors include nonconjugative plasmids (e.g., pSC101, ColEl, or derivatives thereof [21-27]) and variants of bacteriophage, such as lambda (28-- 33). The E. coli K-12 hosts shall not it contain conjugation-proficient plasmids, whether autonomous or integrated, or generalized transducing phages, except as specified ir Section III-0. fl-D-I-a-(2). Other Prokaryotes. Hosts and vectors shall be, at a minimum, comparable in containment to E. colt K-12 with a non conjugative plasmid or bacteriophage vector. The data to be considered and a mechanism for approval of such HV1 systems are described below (Section I-D-2). II-D--b. HV2. These are host-vector systems shown to provide a high level of biological containment as demonstrated by data from suitable tests performed in the laboratory. Escape of the recombinant DNA either via survival of the organisms or via transmission of recombinant DNA fo other organisms should be less than 1/108 under specified conditions. Specific systems: II-D-I-b-(1). For EK2 host-vector n systems in which the vector is a plasmid, no more than one in 108 host cells should be able to perpetuate a cloned DNA fragment under the-t specified nonpermissive laboratory conditions designed to represent the' natural environment, either by survival of the original host or as a consequence of transmission of the cloned DNA fragment. II-D-i-b-(2). For'EK2 host-vector systems in which the vector is a phage, no more than one in 108 phage particles -should be able to perpetuate a cloned DNA fragment under the specified nonpermissive laboratory conditionsdesigned to represent the natural environment either (i) as a prophage (in the inserted or plasmid form) in the laboratory host used for phage propagation or (ii) by surviving in natural environments and transferring a cloned DNA fragment to other hosts (or their resident prophages).\" I-D--c. HV3. These are host-vector systems in which: 1I-D-1-c-(1). All IV2 criteria are met. II-D-i-c-(2). The vector is dependent on its propagation host or is highly defective in mobilizability. Reversion to host-independence must be less than 1/108 per vector genome per generation. II-D-l-c-(3). No markers conferring resistance to antibiotics commonly used clinically or in agriculture are carried by the vector, unless expression of such markers is dependent on the propagating host or on unique laboratory-controlled conditions or Is blocked by the inserted DNA. II-D-1-c-(4). The specified containment shown by laboratory test6 has been independently confirmed by specified tests in animals, including primates, and in other relevant environments. II-D-1-c-(5). The relevant genotypic and phenotypic traits have been independently confirmed. II-D-2. Certification of Host-Vector Systems. II-D-2-a. Responsibility. HVI systems other than E. coli K-12, and HV2 and HV3 host-vector systems, may not be designated as such until they have been certified by the director, NIH. Application for certification of a host- vector system is made by written application to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20205. Host-vector systems that are proposed for certification'will be reviewed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC). (See Section IV-E-1-b-(1)-(c).) This will first involve review of the data on cbnstruction, properties, and testing of the proposed host-vector system by a Working Group composed of one or more members of the RAC and other persons chosen because of their expertise in evaluating such data, The Committee will then evaluate the report of the Working Group and any other available information at a regular meeting. The Director, NIH, is responsible for certification after receiving the advice of the RAC, Minor modifications of existing certified host- vector systems, where the modifications are of minimal or no consequence to the properties relevant to containment may be certified by the Director, NIH,77390 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices without review by the RAC. (See Section IV--1-b-(3]-W.] When new host-Nector systems are certified, notice of the certification will be sent by the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities (ORDA) to the applicant and to all Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBCs] and will be published in the Recombinant DNA Technical Bulletin. Copies of a list of all currently certified host-vector systems may be obtained from ORDA at any time. The Director, NIH, may at any time rescind the certification of any host- vector system. (See Section IV-E-i-b- [3-[i).) If certification of a host-vector system is rescinded, NIH will instruct investigators to transfer cloned DNA into a different system, or use the clones at a higher physical containment level unless NIH determines that the already constructed clones incorporate adequate biological containment. Certification of a given system does not extend to modifications of either the host or vector component of that system. Such modified systems must be independently certified by the Director, NIH. If modifications are minor, it may only be necessary for the investigator to submit data showing that the modifications have either improved or not impaired the major phenotypic traits on which the containment of the system depends. Substantial modifications of a certified system require the submission of complete testing data. ll-D--?b. Data To Be Submitted for Certification. I-D-2--b-(1). HV1 Systems Other than E. Coli K-12. The following types of data shall be submitted, modified as appropriate for the particular system under consideration: (i) A description of the organism and vector;, the strain's natural habitat and growth requirements; its physiological properties, particularly those related to its reproduction and survival and the mechanisms by which it exchanges genetic information; the range of organisms with which this organism normally exchanges genetic information and what sort of information is exchanged; and any relevant information on its pathogenicity or toxicity. (ii) A description of the history of the particular strains and vectors to be used, including data on any mutations which render this organism less able to survive or transmit genetic information. (iii) A general description of the range of experiments contemplated, with emphasis on the need for developing such an HV1 system. ll-D-2-b-(2). HV2 Systems. Investigators planning to request HV2certification for host-vector systems can obtain instructions from ORDA concerning data to be submitted (33A, 33B). In general, the following types of data are required: (i) Description of construction steps, with indication of source, properties, and manner of introduction of genetic traits. (ii) Quantitative data on the stability of genetic traits that contribute to the containment of the system. (ii) Data on the survival of the host-vector system under nonpermissive laboratory conditions designed to represent the relevant natural environment. (iv) Data on transmissibility of the vector and/or a cloned DNA fragment under both permissive and nonpermissive conditions. (v) Data on all other properties of the system which affect containment and utility, including information on yields of phage or plasmid molecules, ease of DNA isolation, and ease of transfection or transformation. (vi) In some cases, the investigator may be asked to submit data on survival and vector transmissibility from experiments in which the host-vector is fed to laboratory animals (e.g., rodents). Such in viva data may be required to confirm the validity of predicting in vivo survival on the basis of in vitro experiments. Data must be submitted in writing to ORDA. Ten to twelve weeks are normally required for review and circulation of the data prior to the meeting at which such data can be considered by the RAC. Investigators are encouraged to publish their data on the construction, properties, and testing of proposed HV2 systems prior to consideration of the system by the RAC and its subcommittee. More specific instructions concerning the type of data to be submitted to NIH for proposed EK2 systems involving either plasmids or bacteriophage X in E. ORDA. II-D--b-{3). HV3 Systems. Putative HV3 systems must, as the first step in certification, be certified as HV2 systems. Systems which meet the criteria given above under II-D--1-{c)-, ll-D-1-(c)-2, and II-D-1-{cJ-3 will then be recommended for HV3 testing. Tests to evaluate various HV2 host-vector systems for HV3 certification will be performed by contractors selected by NIH. These contractors will repeat tests performed by individuals proposing the HV2 system and, in addition, will conduct more extensive tests on conditions likely to be encountered in nature. The genotypic and phenotypic traits of HV2 systems will be evaluated. Tests on survival and transmissibility in and on animals, including primates, willbe performed, as well as tests on survival in certain specified natural environments. I-D-3. Distribution of Certified Host- Vectors. Certified HV2 and HV3 host- vector systems (plus appropriate control strains) must be obtained from the NIH or its designees, one of whom will be the investigator who developed the system. NIH shall announce the availability of the system by publication of notices in appropriate journals. Plasmid vectors will be provided in a suitable host strain, and phage vectors will be distributed as small-volume lysates. If NIH propagates any of the host strains or phage, a sample will be sent to the investigator who developed the system or to an appropriate contractor, prior to distribution, for verification that the material is free from contamination and unchanged in phenotypic properties. In distributing the certified HV2 and HV3 host-vector systems, NIH or its designee will (i] send out a complete description of the system; (ii) enumerate and describe the tests to be performed by the user in order to verify important phenotypic traits; (iii] remind the user that any modification of the system necessitates independent approval of the system by the NIH: and (iv) remind the user of responsibility for notifying ORDA of any discrepancies with the reported properties or any problems in the safe use of the system. NIH may also distribute certified HV1 host-vector systems. I m. Containment Guidelines for Covered Experiments Part 1I discusses experiments covered by the Guidelines. The reader must first consult Part I. where listings are given of prohibited and exempt experiments. Containment guidelines for permissible experiments are given in Part Ill. For these experiments no registration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is necessary. However, for these experiments, prior to their initiation, investigators must submit to their Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) a registration document that contains a description of (a) the source(s) of DNA, (b) the nature of the inserted DNA sequences, (c) the hosts and vectors to be used, (d) whether a deliberate attempt will be made to obtain expression of a foreign gene in the cloning vehicle and if so, what protein, and (e) the containment conditions specified by these Guidelines. This registration document must be dated and signed by the investigator and filed only with the local IBC. The IBC shall review all such proposals: IBC review prior to initiation77391 3 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices of the experiment is not required for most experiments described-in Section 111-0. Prior IBC review is required for all other'experiments described in the subsections of Part m. Changes from the levels specified in Part m for specific experiments'(or the assignment of levels to experiments not explicitly considered here) may not be instituted without the express approval of the Director, NIH. (See Sections IV-F_-1-b-(1}-(a), IV-E-l-b-[1}-[b), IV-E-l7 b-(2)-(b), IV-E-i-b-(2)-[c), and IV-E-1-b-(3}-(b].} In the classification of containment criteria for different kinds of recombinant DNAs, the stated levels of physical and biological containment are .minimal for the experiments designated. The use of higher levels of biological containment (HV3<HV2<HVi) is encouraged if they are available and equally appropriate for the purposes of the experiment. III-O: Classification of Experiments Using E. coli K-12 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Host-Vector Systems. Most recombinant DNA experiments being done employ E. coil K-12 host- vettor systems; others employ the S. cerevislae host-vector systems. These are the systems for Which we have the most experience and knowledge. Some experiments using E. coli K-12 and S. cerevisiae host-vector systems and prohibited (see Section I-D). Some experiments using E. coil K-12 and S. cerevisiae host-vector systems are exempt from the Guidelines (see Section I-E). Experiments using E. coli K-12 host- vector systems and DNA from Class 3 organisms [11 or from cells kndwn to be infected with these agents will be conducted at P3 containment or at a lower level as specified by NIH (See Section IV-E-1-b-2-(e)). Other experiments using E. coil K-12 or laboratory strains of S. cerevisiae shall use P1 physical containment and; except as specified in the last paragraph of this section, an HV1 host-vector' system ti.e., for experiments using E. coli K-12 (a) the E. coli host shall'not contain conjugation-proficient plasmids or generalized transducingphages, and (b) Ff - bacteriophages or non-conjugative plasmids [491 shall be used as vectors. For experiments in S. cerevisiae, laboratory strains shall be used].,For these experiments review by-the IBC prior to the initiation.of the experiment is not required. An exception; however, which does require prior review and approval by the IBC is any experiment in which there is a deliberate attempt to have the E. coli K-12 efficiently express as a protein product the informationcarried in any gene derived from a eukaryotic organism or from any virus or viroid which infects a eukaryotic .organism. Experiments involving th6 insertion into E. coli K-12 of DNA from prokaryotes that exchange genetic information with E. coil by known physiological processes will be exempted from these Guidelines if they' appear on the \"list of exchangers\" set forth in Appendix A (see' Secti5n I-,-4). For those not on the Appendix A list but Vihich exchange genetic information (35) with E. call, experiments may be performed with any E. coli K-12 vector (e.g., conjugative plasmid). When a non- conjugative vector is used, the E. coli K- 12 host may contain conjugation- proficient plasmids, either autonomous or integrated, or generalized transducing phages. III-0-i. Experiments Involving Class 3 Organisms. Experiments involving recombiant DNA from Class 3 organisms (1) or from cells known to be infected with these agents may be conducted at P3 containment in E. coll K-12 EKi hosts (see Section 111-0). Containment levels for all other' experiments with Class 3 organisms or with recombinant DNA which increases the virulence and host range of a plant .pathogen beyond that which occurs by natural genetic exchange will be determined by NIH. (See Section (IV-E- 1-b-2-e)}. 11-A. Classification of Experiment& Using Certain HV1 Host- Vector Systems. Certain HVI and HV2 host-vector systems are assigned containment levels as specified in the subsections of this Section III-A. Those so classified as of publication of these rervised Guidelines are listed in Appendix D. An updated list may be obtained from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20205. HI-A-1. Shotgun Experiments. These experiments involve the production of recombinant DNAs between the vector and portions of the specified cellular source, preferably a partially purified fraction.

Other Cold-Blooded Animals andLowerEukaryotes This large class of eukaryotes is divided into two groups: HIf-A-i-a-(5-a. Species that are known to produce a potent polypeptide toxin (34) that acts in vertebrates, or are known pathogens listed in Class 2, (1) or are known to carry such pathogens must use P3 physical containment + an HV2 host-vector. When the potent toxin is not a polypeptide and is likely not to be the product of closely linked eukaryoto genes, containment may be reduced to P3+HV1 or PZ+HV2. Species that produce potept toxins that affect invertebrates or plants but not vertebrates require P2+HV2 or P3+HV1. Any species that has a demonstrated capacity for carrying particular pathogenic microorganisms Is included in this group, unless the organisms used as the source of DNA have been shown not to contain those agents, in which case they may be' placed in the following group. (2A) rn-A-I-a-{5}-(b). The remainder of the species in this class including plant pathogenic or symbiotic fungi that do not produce potent toxins: P2+HV1 or PI+HV2. However, any insect in this group must be either (i) grown under laboratory conditions for at least 10 generations prior to its-use as a source of DNA, or (ii) if caught in the wild, must be shoivn to be free of disease-causing microorganisms or must belong to a species that does not carry microorganisms causing disease in vertebrates or plants. (ZA) If these conditions cannot be met, experiments must be done under P3+-HV1 or P2+HV2 containment. rn-A--a-t6). Plants. P2 physical containment + an HV1 host-vector, or PI+HV2. If the plant source makes a potent polypeptide toxin, (34) the containment must be raised to P3 physical containment + HV2 host- vector.

The containment levels required for shotgun experiments with DNA from prokaryotes apply to their plasmids or phages'(See Section III-A-1-b.)Ill-A-3. Lowering of Containment Levels for Characterized or Purified DNA Preparations and Clones. Many of thd risks which might conceivably arise from some types of recombinant DNA experiments, particularly shotgun' experiments, would result from the inadvertent cloning of a harmful sequence. Therefore, in cases where the risk of inadvertently cloning the\"wrong\" DNA is reduced by prior enrichment for the desired piece, or in- which a clone made from a random assortment of DNAs has been purified and the absence of harmful sequences established, the containment conditions for further work may be reduced. The following section outlines the mechanisms for such reductions. Ill-A-3-a. Purified DNA Other than Plasmids, Bacteriophages, and Other Viruses. The Tormation of DNA recombinants from cellular DNAs that have been purified (41) and in which the absence of harmful sequences has been established (3) can be carried out under lower containment conditions than used for the corresponding shotgun experiment.(42). The containment may be decreased one step in physical containment (P4+P3; P3+P2; P2+P1) while maintaining the biological containment specified for the shotgun experiment, or one step in biological containment (HV3+HV2; HV2+HV1) while maintaining the specified physical containment. The Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) must review such a reduction and the approval of the IBG and of the NIH must be secured before such a reduction may be put into effect. EBC approval is sufficient for such a reduction except for any ltwering of 'containment under Section IMl-A-3--a to levels below P1 +HV1, which requires prior NIH approval. (See Section IV-E-1-b-(3)-[e).)Virus classIll-A-3-b. Characterized Clones of DNA Recombinants. When a cloned DNA recombinant has been rigorously characterized and the absence of harmful sequences has been established (3) experiments involving this recombinant DNA may be carried out under lower containment conditions. Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBCs) may give approval for a single- step reduction in physical or biological containment on receipt of evidence of characterization of a clone'derived from a shotgun experiment and its probable freedom from harmful genes. IBC approval is sufficient for such a reduction except for any lowering of containment under Section M-A-3-b to levels below P1+HV1, or reduction of containment levels by more than one step, which also requires prior NIH approval. (See Section IV-E-1-b-3-(e).) 111-B. Experiments with Prokaryotic Host-Vectors Other Than Certain certified HV1 and HV2 host- vector systems appear in Appendix D. The containment levels for these systems are given in the subsections of Section Il1-A. Other systems in the future may be certified as HV1 and HV2. At thetime of certification, the classification of containment levels for experiments \"using them will be assigned by NIH.I M-B-2. Return of DNA Segments to Prokaryotic Non-HVI Host of Origin, Certain experiments involving those prokaryotes that echange genetic information with E. coli by known physiological processes will be exempt from these Guidelines if they appear on the \"list of exchangers\" set forth in Appendix A (see Section I-E-4). For a prokaryote which can exchange genetic information(35) with E. coli under laboratory conditions but which Is not on the list (Host A), the following type of experiment may be carried out under P1 conditions without Host A having been approved as an HVI host: DNA from Host A may be inserted into a vector and propagated in E. coli K-12 under P1 conditions.'Subsequently, this recombinant DNA'may be returned to Host A by mobilization, transformation, or transduction and may then be propagated in Host A in any desired vector under P1 conditions. , For a prokaryote which does not exchange genetic information with E. - coil (Hdst B), the following type of , experiment may be carried out without Host B having been approved as an HVt host: DNA from Host B may be inserted into a vector and propagated in E. coil K-12 under P1 conditions. Subsequently, this recombinant DNA may be returned to Host B and progagated in Host B under P1 conditions.(43)77394 . Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices M-B-3. Non-HVi Systems. Containment levels for other classes of experiments involving non-HV1 systems may be approved by the Director, NIH. (See Sections IV-E-i-b- 1)-f b), rV-B-1- b-(2)-{c), and IV-E--1-b-[3)-(b) ) In those cases where genetic exchange has not been demonstrated between two bacterial species A and B, neither of which is known to be pathogenic for man, animals, or plants, recombinant DNA experiments involving only A and B can be conducted under P3 containment2.A) Lower levels of physical containment may be assigned by NIH for specific donor-recipient combinations (See Section IV-E-I-b-2-(O). rn-C. Experiments rn-C--a, -b, -c and -d involve the use of specific viral vectors, namely polyoma, SV40, human adenoviruese 2 and 5, and mouse adenovirus strain FL, respectively. The subsections of Section rn--C-i-e involve the use of all viral vectors including the specific viral vectors considered in the subsections of Sections rn-c-1-a, -b, -c and -d, as well as any other viral vector. When the reader finds that the containment level given for specific experiment in a subsection of Section rn-C-i-e is different from the containment level given in a subsection of Section rn-C-- a, -b, -c or -d, he may choose which of the two containment levels he wishes to use for the experiment. rn-C-I-a.

DNA recombinants formed between such vectors and host DNA, when propagated only in that hose (or a closely related strain of the same species), are exempt. from these Guidelines (see Section I-E). DNA recombinants formed between such vectors and nonviral DNA from cells other than the host species require only P1 physical containment for cells in culture since vertebrate cells in tissue culture irjherently exhibit a very high level of containment.

DNA recombinants formed between such Vectors and DNA from cells other than the host species require P1 physical containment'for invertebrate cells in culture since invertebrate cells in culture inherently exhibit a very high level of containment. Experiments which require -the use of whole animals will beevaluated by NIH on a case-by-case basis. (45) III-C-3. Plant Viral Host- Vector Systems. (48) The DNA plant viruses which could currently serve as vectors for cloning genes in plants and plant call protoplasts are Cauliflower Mosiac Virus (CaMV) and its close relatives (2A) which have relaxed circular double-stranded DNA genomes with a molecular weight of 4.5 X 106, and Bean Golden Mosaic Virus (BGMV) and related viruses with small (<106 d~ltons) single-stranded DNA gonomos. CaMV is spread in nature by aphids, in which it survives for a few hours. Spontaneous mutants of CaMV which lack a factor essential for aphid transmission arise frequently. BGMV Is spread in nature by whiteflies, and certain other single-strandedDNA plant viruses are transmitted by leafhoppers. The DNA plant viruses have narrow host ranges and are relatively difficult to transmit mechanically to plants, For this reason, they are most unlikely to be accidentally transmitted from spillage of purified virus preparations. When these.viruses are used as vectors in intact plants, or propagative plant parts, the plants shall be grown under P1 conditions-that is, in either a limited access greenhouse or plant growth cabinet which is insect- restrictive, preferably with positive air pressure, (2A) and in which an insect fumigation regime is maintained. Soil, plant pots, and unwanted infected materials shall be removed from the greenhouse or cabinet in sealed Insect- proof containers and sterilized. It is not necessary to sterilize run-off water from the infected plants, as this is not a plausible route for secondary infection, When the viruses are used as vectors In tissue cultures or in small plants in axenic cultures, no special containment is necessary. Infected plant materials which have to be removed from the greenhouse or cabinet for further research shall be maintained under insect-restrictive conditions. These measures provide an entirely adequate degree of containment. They are similar to those required in many countries for licensed handling of \"exotic\" plant viruses. The viruses or their DNA may also be useful as vectors to introduce genes Into plant protoplasts. The fragility of plant protoplasts combined with the properties of the viruses provides adequate safety. Since no risk to the environment from the use of the DNA plant virus/protoplast system Is envisaged, no special containment is necessary, except as described in the following paragraph.77396 Federal Register / VoL 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices Experiments involving the use of plant genomes to propagate DNA sequences from eukaryotic viruses will be evaluated by NIH on a case-by-case basis (45) and will be conducted under the prescribed physical and biological containment conditions. (See Section IV-E-1-b-{3-{c).) rI-C. Plant Host- Vector Systems Other than Viruses. (48) Organelle, plasmid, and chromosomal DNAs may be used as vectors. DNA recombinants formed between such vectors and host DNA, when propagated only in that host (or a closely related strain of the same species), are exempt from these guidelines (see Section I-E). DNA recombinants formed between such vectors and DNA from cells other than the host species require P2 physical containment. The development of host- vector systems that exhibit a high level of biological containment, such as those using protoplasts or undifferentiated cells in culture, permit (2A) a decrease in the physical containment to P1. Intact plants or propagative plant parts which cannot be grown in a standard P2 laboratory because of their large size may be grown under the P1 conditions described above in Section rn-c, except that (i) sterilization of run-off water is required where this is a plausible route for secondary infection and (ii) the standard P2 practices are adopted for microbiological work, and (iii) negative air pressure should be employed in the greenhouse or growth chamber when infectious agents are used which generate airborne propagules. I-C-6. Fungal or Similar Lower Eukryotic Host- Vector Systems., Certain certified HV1 and HV2 host- vector system appear in Appendix D. The containment levels for these systems are given in the subsections of Section M-A. Other systems in the future may be certified as HV1 and HV2. At the time of certification, they may be added to Appendix D (and thus the containment levels for their use will be those of the subsections of Section M- A). Alternatively, at the time of their certification, another classification of containment levels for experimenls using them may be assigned by NIH. In addition to the experiments described above, the following experiments may be carried out without the eukaryotic host (Host C) having been approved as an HV1 h6st. DNA from Host C may be inserted into a vector and propagated in E. coi K-12 under P1 conditions. Subsequently, this recombinant DNA may be returned to Host C and propagated there under P1 conditions. (43)Containment levels for other classes of experiments involving non-HV1 systems may be expressly approved by the Director, NIH. (See Sections IV-E-1- b-(1]-(b). IV-E-1-b-(2)-(c). and IV-E-1-b-(-{8-by.} III-C-6. Return of DNA Segments to a Higher Eukaryotic Host of Origin. DNA from a higher eukaryote (Host D) may be inserted into a vector and propagated in ]- coli K-12 under P1 containment conditions. Subsequently, this recombinant DNA may be returned to Host D and propagated under conditions of physical containment comparable to P1 and appropriate to the organism under study. (24) rn-C-7. Transfer of cloned DNA Segments to Eukaryotic Organisms. II--C-7-a. Transfer to Non-human Vertebrates. DNA from any nonprohibited source [Section I-D], except for greater than one quarter of a eukaryoticeviral genome, which has been cloned and propagated in F. col\" under P1 conditions, may be transferred with the E. coli vector used for cloning to any eukaryotic cells in culture or to any non-human vertebrate organism and propagated under conditions of physical containment comparable to P1 and appropriate to the organism under study (24). Transfers to any other host will be considered by the RAC on a case-by- case basis (45). rn-C-7--b. Transfer to Higher Plants. DNA from any nonprohibited source [Section I-D) which has been cloned and propagated in E. coli or S. cerevisioe under Pi conditions, may be transferred with the \u00a3 cali or S. cerevisiae vector used for cloning to any higher plant organisms (Angiosperms and Gymnosperms] and progagated under conditions of physical containment comparable to P1 and appropriate to the organism under study (2A]. Intact plants or propagative plant parts may be grown undr Pi conditions described undr Section n-C-. Containment must be modified to ensure that the spread of pollen, seed or other propagules is prevented. This can be accomplished by conversion to negative pressure in the growth cabinet or greenhouse or by physical entrapment by \"bagging\" of reproductive structures. Transfers to any other plant organisms will be considered on a case-by-case basis (45). m-D. ComplementaryDNAs. Specific containment levels are given in Section M-A-3-a (see also last column of Table III) for complementary DNA (cDNA] of viral mRNA. For the other Sections of the Guidelines, where applicable, cDNAs synthesized in vitro are included within each of the above classifications. For example, cDNAs formed fromcellular RNAs that are not purified and characterized are included under III-A- 1, shotgun experiments; cDN's formed from purified and characterized RNAs are included under I-A--3; etc. Due to the possibility of nucleic acid contamination of enzyme preparations used in the preparation of cDNAs, the investigator must employ purified enzyme preparations that are free of viral nucleic acid. lII-E. Synthetic DNAs. If the synthetic DNA segment is likely to (24] yield a potentially harmful polynucleotide or polypeptide (e.g.. a toxin or a pharmacologically active agent), the containment conditions must be as stringent as would be used for propagating the natural DNA counterpart If the synthetic DNA sequence codes for a harmless product,(2A] it may be propagated at the same containment level as its purified natural DNA counterpart. For example, a synthetic DNA segment which corresponds to a nonharmful gene of birds, to be propagated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, would require P2 physical containment plus an H-VI host-vector, or P1+ HV2. If the synthetic DNA segment is not expressed in vivo as a polynucleotide or polypeptide product, the organisms containing the recombinant DNA molecule arc exempt (4) from the Guidelines. IV. Roles and Responsibilities IV-A. Policy. Safety in activities involving recombinant DNA depends on the individual conducting them. The Guidelines cannot anticipate every possible situation. Motivation and good judgement are the key essentials to protection of health and the environment. The Guidelines are intended to help the Institution, the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), the Biological Safety Officer, and the Principal Investigator determine the safeguards that should be implemented. These Guidelines will never be complete or final, since all conceivable experiments involving recombinant DNA cannot be foreseen. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the Institution and those associated with it to adhere to the puipose of the Guidelines as well as to their speiffics. Each Institution (and the IBG acting on its behalf) is responsible for ensuring that recombinant DNA activities comply with the Guidelines. General recognition of institutional authority and responsibility properly establishes accountability for safe conduct of the research at the local level.77397 Federal Register / Vol., 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices The following roles and responsibilities constitute an administrative framework in which safety is an essential and integral part oJ research involving recombinant DNA molecules. Further clarifications and interpretations of roles and responsibilities will be issued by NIH as necessary. I IV-B. General Applicability. The Guidelines-are applicable to all recombinant DNA research within the United States or its territories which is conducted at or sponsored by an Institution that receives any support for recombinant DNA research from NIH.' This includes research performed by NIH directly. I An individual receiving support for research involving recombinant DNA must be associated with or sponsored by an Institution that can and does assume the responsibilities assigned in these Guidelinies. The Guidelines are also applicable to projects done abroad if they are supported by NIH funds. If the host country, however, has established rules for the conduct of recombinaht DNA projects, then a certificate of compliance with those rules may be submitted to NIH in lieu of compliance with the NIH Guidelines. NIH reserves the right to withhold funding if the safety practices to be employed abroad are not reasonably consistent with the NIH Guidelines. IV-C. General Definitions. The following terms, which are used throughout the Guidelines, are defined as folloyws: IV-C-1. molecules\" means either (i) molecules which are constructed outside living cells by joining natural or synthetic DNA segments to DNA molecules that can replicate in a living cell, or (ii) DNA molecules which result from the replication of a molecule described in (i) above.

IV-D-1-h. Determine the necessity, in connection with each project, for health surveillance of recombinant DNA research personnel, and conduct, if found appropriate, a health surveillance program for the project. [The Laboratory Safety Monograph (LSM) discusses various possible components of such a program-for example, records of agents handled, active investigation of relevant illnesses, and the maintenance of serial serum samples for monitoring serologic changes that may result from the employees' work experience. Certain medical conditions may place a laboratory worker at increased risk in any endeavor where infectious agents are handled. Examples given in the LSM include gastrointestinal disorders and treatment with steroids, immunosuppressive drugs, or antibiotics. Workers with such disorders or treatment should be evaluated to determine whether they should be engaged in research with potentially hazardous organisms during their .treatment or illness.] IV-D-1-i.

IV-G-5. Voluntary Compliance. Any individual, corporation, or institution that is nototherwise covered by the Guidelines is encouraged to conduct recombinant DNA research activities in accordance with the Guidelines, through the procedures set forth in Part VI. -V. Footnotes And References -1. The reference to organisms as Class 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 refers to the classification in the publication Classification of Etiologic Agents on the Basis of Hazaid, 4th Edition, July 1974; U.S. Department otHealth, Education, and -Welfare, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control, Office of Biosafety, Atlanta, Georgia 30333. The list of organisms in each- class, as given in this publication,-is reprinted in Appendix B to these Guidelines. ' The Director, NIH, with advice of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, may designate certain of the agents which are listed as Class 2 in the Classification of, Etiologic Agents on the Basis of Hazard, 4th Edition, July 1974, as Class 1 agents for the Purposes of these Guidelines (See section IV- E-1-b-2]-(d}). An updated list of such agents may be obtained from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities (ORDA}, National Institutes of Health. Bethesda, Maryland 20205. The entirb Classification of Etiologic Agents on the Basis of Hazard is in the process of revision., For experiments using Vesicular Stomatitis virus (VSV), contact the NIH Offic; of Recombinant DNA Activities. - A. In Parts I and Ill of the Guidelines, there are a number of places where Judgments are to be made.'These include:\"cells known to be infected with such agents\" (Section 1-D-l) \"toxins potent for vertebrates\" acquire naturally\" (Section I-D-5]; \"known to produce a potent polypeptide toxin * * * or known to carry such pathogens. * * * not likely to be a product of closely linked eukaryote genes *... shown- not to contain such agents\"- (Section M-A-1- a-(5]-(a)); \"shown to be (Footnote 34). In all thise dases the principal investigator is to make the initial judgment on these matters as part of his responsibility to \"make the initial determination of the required levels of physical and biological containment in accordance with the Guidelines\" (Section IV-D-7-a). In all these cases, this judgment is to be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee as part of its responsibility to make \"an independent assessment of the containment levels- - required by these Guidelines for the proposed research\"-(Section IV-1)3-a-1]). If the IBC wishes, any specific cases maybe referred to the NIH Office of Recombinant DNA Activities as part of ORDA's functions to \"provide advice to all within and outside -NIH\" (Section V-E-3, and ORDA may request advice from the Recombinant DNAAdvisory Committee as part of the RAC's responsibility for \"interpreting and determining containment levels upon request by ORDA\" (Section IV-E-1-b-(2)-(aD}. 3. The following types of data should be considered in determining whether DNA recombinants are \"characterize\" and the absence of harmful sequences has been established: (a) the absence of potentially harmful genes (e.g., sequences contained In indigenous tumor viruses or sequences that code for toxins, invasins, virulence factors, etc., that might potentiate the pathogenicity or communicability of the vector and/or the host or be detrimental to humans, animals, or plants); (b) the type(s) of genetic Information on the cloned sedment and the nature of transcriptional and translation gone products specified; Cc] the relationship between the recovered and desired segment (e.g., hybridization and restriction endonuckease fragmentation analysis where applicable): (d) the genetic stabillity of the cloned fragment: and (e) any alterations in the biological properties of the vector and host. 4. In Section I-E, \"exemptions\" from the Guidelines are discussed. Such experiments are not covered by the Guidelines and need not be registered with NIH. In Section I-D on \"prohibitions,\" the possibility of \"exceptions\" is discussed. An \"exception\" means that any experiment may be expressly released from a prohibition. At that time it will be assigned an appropriate level of physical and biological containment. 5. Care should be taken to Inactivate recombinant DNA before disposal. Procedures for inactivating DNA can'be found in the \"Laboratory Safety Monograph. A Supplement to the NIH Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research.\" 6.

A Class Iis a ventilated cabinet for personnel protection having an inward flow of air away from the operator. The exhaust air from this cabinet is filtered through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. This cabinet is used in three operational modes: (1) with a full-width open front, (2) with an installed front closure panel (having four 8-inch diameter openings) without gloves, and (3) with an installed front closure panel equipped with arm-length rubber gloves. The face velocity of the inward flow of air through the full-width open front is 75 feet per minute or greater. A Class H cabinet is a ventilated cabinet for personnel and product protection having an open front with inward air flow for personnel protection, and HEPA filtered mass recirculated air flow for product protection. The cabinet exhaust air is filtered through a HEPA fiter. The face velocity of the inward flow of air through the full-width open front is 75 feet per minute or greater. Design and performance specifications for Class H cabinets have been adopted by the National Sanitation Foundation, Ann Arbor, Michigan. A Class 111 cabinet is a closed-front ventilated cabinet of gas-tight construction which provides the highest level of personnel protection of all biohazard safety cabinets. The interior of the cabinet is protected from contaminants exterior to the cabinet The cabinet is fitted with arm-length rubber gloves and is operated under a-negative pressure of at least 0.5 inches water gauge. All supply air is filtered through HEPA filters. Exhaust air is filtered through two HEPA filters or one HEPA filter and incinerator before being discharged to the outside environment. 21.

As classified in the Third Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses: Classification and Nomenclature of Viruses. R. E. F. Matthews, Ed. Intervirology 12 (129-296) 1979. (As noted in the Prohibition Section. the use of viruses classified [1] as Class 4 or 5 is prohibited.) 37. The cDNA copy of the viral mRNA must be >99% pure; otherwise as for shotgun experiments with eukaryotic cellular DNA. 37A. For the purpose of these Guidelines, viruses of the families Papovavirida, Adenoviridae and Herpetoviridae (38) should be considered as \"transforming\" viruses. While only certain of these viruses have been associated with cell transformation in viva or in vitro, it seems prudent to consider all members to be potentially capable of transformation. In addition, those viruses of the family Poxviridae that produce proliferative responses--Le., myxoma, rabbit and Yaba viruses-should considered as \"transforming:' 38.=-99% pure (i.e, less than 1% of the DNA consists of intact viral genomes); otherwise as for whole genomes. 39. The viruses have been classified by NCI as \"moderate-risk oncogenic viruses.\" See \"Laboratory Safety Monograph-A Supplement to the NIH Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research\" for recommendations on handling the viruses themselves. 40. (Deleted) 41. The DNA preparation is defined as \"purified\" If the desired DNA represents at least 99% (w/w) of the total DNA in the preparation, provided that it was verified by more than one procedure. 42. The lowering of the containment level when this degree of purification has been obtained is based on the fact that the total number of clones that must be examined to obtain the desired clone is markedly reduced. Thus, the probability of cloning a harmful gene could, for example, be reduced by more than 105-fold when a nonrepetitive gene from mammals was being sought. Furthermore, the level of purity specified here makes it easier to establish that the desired DNA does not contain harmful genes. 43. This is not permitted, of course, ifit falls under any of the Prohibitions of Section I-D. Of particular concern here is prohibition I-D-5, i.e., \"Deliberate transfer of a drug resistance trait to micro-organisms that are not known to acquire it naturally if such acquisition could compromise the use of a drug to control disease agents in human or veterinary medicine or agriculture.\" 44. Because this work will be done almost exclusively in tissue culture cells, which have no capacity for propagation outside the laboratory, the primary focus for containment is the vector. It should be pointed out that risk of laboratory-acquired infection as a consequence of tissue culture manipulation is very low. Given good microbiological practices, the most likely mode of escape of recombinant DNAs from a physically contained laboratory is carriage by an infected human. Thus the vector with an inserted DNA segment should have little or no ability to replicate or spread in humans.77403 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices For use as a vector in a vertebrate host cell system, an animal viral DNA molecule ihould display the following properties: (i] It should not consist of the whole genome of any agent that is infectious for humans or that replicates to a significant extent in human cells in tissue culture. If the recombinant molecule is used to transform nonpermissive cells (ie, cells which do not produce infectious virus particles, thisis not a requirement. (ii) It should be derived from a virus whose epidemiological behavior and host range are well understood. , (iii) In permissive cells, it should be defective when carrying an inserted DNA segment (i.e., propagation of the recombinant DNA as a virus must be dependent upon the presence of a complementing helper genome). In almost all cases this condition Would be achieved automatically by the manipulations used to construct and propagate the recombinants. In addition, the amount of DNA encapsidatedin the particles of most animal viruses is defined within fairly close limits. The insertion of sizable foreign DNA sequences, therefore, generally demands a compensatory deletion of viral sequences. It maybe possible to introduce very short insertions (50-100 base pairs) without rendering the viral vector defective. In such a situation, the requirement that the viral vector be defective is not necessary, except in those cases in whichthe inserted DNA encodes a biologically active polypeptide. It is desired but not required that the functional anatomy of the vector be known- that is, fL-re sLogid be a clear idea of the location within the molecule of: (i) the sites at which DNA synthesis originates and terminates, (it) the sites that are cleaved by restriction endonucleases, and (iii) the template regions for the major gene product. . If possible the helper virus genome should: (i) be integrAted into the genome of a stable line of host cells (a situation that would effectively limit the growth of the vector' recombinant to such cell lines) or (ii) consist of a defective genome, or an appropriate conditional lethal mutant virus, making vector and helper dependent upon each other for propagation. However, neither of these stipulations is a requirement. 45. Review of NIH on a case-by-case basis means that NIH must review and set appropriate containment conditions before the work may be undertaken. NIH actions in such case-by-case reviews will be published in the Recombinant DNA Technical Bulletin. 46. Provided the inserted DNA sequences are not derived from eukaryotic viruses. In the latter case, such experiments will be evaluated on a case-by-casebasis. 47. >99% pure; otherwise as for shotgun experiments. I 48. A USDA permit, required for import and interstate transport of pathogens, may be obtained from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA, Federal Building. Hyattsville, MD 20782. r 49. A subset of non-conjugative plasmid vectors are also poorly mobilizable (e.g., pBR322, pBR313). Where practical, these vectors should be employed.50. i.e., the total of all genomes within a Family shall not exceed two-thirds of the genome. VI. Voluntary Compliance .VI-A. Basic policy. Individuals, corporations, and institutions not otherwise covered by-the Guidelines are encouraged to do so by following the standards and procedures set forth in Parts I-IV of the Guidelines. In order to simplify discussion, references hereafter, to \"institutions\" are intended to encompass corp6rations, and individuals who have no organizational affiliation. For-purposes of complying with the Guidelines, an individual intending to carry out research involving recombinant DNA is encouraged to affiliate with an institution that-has an, Institutional Biosafety Committee approved under the Guidelines. -Since commercial organizations have special concerns, such as protection of proprietary data, some modifications and explanations of the procedures in Parts I-IV are provided below, in order to address these concerns. VI-B. BCApproval. The NIH Office -of Recombinant DNA Activities (ORDA) will review the membership of an institution's Institutional Biosafety Committee (I1C) and, where it finds the BC meets the requirements set forth in Section IV-D-2, will give its approval to the IBC membership. It should be emphasized that. employment of an IBC member solely for purposes of membership on the IBC does not itself make the member an institutionally affiliated member for purposes of Section IV-D-2-a.Except for the unaffiliated members, a member of an IBC for an institution not otherwise covered by the Guidelines may participate in the review and approval of a project in which the member has a direct financial interest, so long as the member has not been and does not expect to be engaged in the project. Section IV-D-2-d is modified to that extent for purposes of these institutions. VI--C. (Deleted) * VI-D. Certification of Host-Vector Systems. A host-vector system may be proposed for certification by the Director, NIH, in-accordance with the procedures set forth in Section II-D-2-a. Institutions not otherwise covered by the Guidelines will not be subject to Section II-D-3 by complying with these procedures. In order to ensure protection for proprietary data, any public notice regarding a hose-vector system which is designated by the institution as proprietary under Section VI-F-1 will be issued only after consultation with theinstitution as to the content of the notice. VI-E. Requests for Exceptions, Exemptions, Approvals. Requests for exceptions from prohibitions, exemptions, or other approvals required by the Guidelines should be requested by following the procedures set forth In the appropriate sections in Parts I-IV of the Guidelines. In order to ensure protection for proprietary data, any public liotice regarding a request for an exception, exemption, or other approval which is designated by the institution as proprietary under Section VI-F-1 will be issued'only after consultation with the institution as to the content of the notice. VJ-F. Protection of Proprietary Jiata, In general, the Freedom of Information Act requires Federal agencies to make their records available to the public upon request. However, this requirement does not apply to, among other things, \"trade secrets and commercial and financial information obtained from at person aad privileged or confidential.\" 18 U.S.C. 1905, in turn makes It a crime for an officer or employee of the United States or any Federal department or agency to publish, divulge, disclose, or make known \"in any manner or to any extent not authorized by law any information coming to him in the course of his-employment or official duties or by reason of any examination or investigation made by, or return, report or record made to or filed with, such department or agency or officer or employee thereof, which information concerns or relates to the trade secrets, [or processes * * * of any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or association.\" This provision applies to all employees of the Federal Government, including special Government employees. Members of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee are \"special Government employees.\" VI-F-1. In submitting information to NIH for purposes of complying voluntarily with the Guidelines, an institution may designate those items of informiationwhich the institution believes constitute trade secrets or privileged or 6onfidential commercial or financial information. VI-F-2. If NIH receives a request under the Freedom of Information Act for information so designated, NIH will promptly contact the institution to secure its views as to whether the information (or some portion) should be released. VI-F--3. If the NIH decides to release this information (or some portion) in response to a Freedom of Information request or otherwise, the institution will77404 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices be advised; and the actual release will not be made until the expiration of 15 days after the institution is so advised, except to the extent that earlier release, in the judgement of the Director, NIH, is necessary to protect against an imminent hazard to the public or the environment. VI-F-4. Projects should be registered in accordance with procedures specified in the Administrative Practices Supplement. The following information will usually be considered publicly available information, consistent with the need to protect proprietary data: a. The names of the institution and principal investigator. b. The location where the experiments will be performed. c. The host-vector system. d. The source of the DNA. e. The level of physical containment. VI-F-5-a. Any institution not otherwise covered by the Guidelines, which is considering submission of data or information voluntarily to NIH, may request presubmission review of the records involved to determine whether. if the records are submitted, NIH will or will not make part or all of the records available upon request under the Freedom of Information Act. VI-F-5-b. A request for presubmission review should be submitted to ORDA. along with the records involved. These records must be clearly marked as being the property of the institution, on loan to NIH solely for the purpose of making a determination under the Freedom of Information Act. ORDA will then seek a determination from the HEW Freedom of Information Officer, the responsible official under HEW regulations (45 CFR Part 5), as to whether the records involved (or some portion) are or are not available to members of the public under the Freedom of Information Act. Pending such a determination, the records will be kept separate from ORDA files, will be considered records of the institution and not ORDA, and will not be received as part of ORDA files. No copies will be made of the records. VI-F-5-c. ORDA will inform the' institution of the HEW Freedom of Information Officer's determination and follow the institution's instructions as to whether some or all of the records involved are to be returned to the institution or to become a part of ORDA files. If the institution instructs ORDA to return the records, no copies or summaries of the records will be made or retained by HEW, NIH, or ORDA. VI-F-5-d. The HEW Freedom of Information Officer's determination will represent that official's judgement, as of the time of the determination, as towhether the records involved (or some portion) would be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, if at the time of the determination the records were in ORDA files and a request was received from them under the Act. Appendix A-Exemptions Under I-E-4 Section I-E-4 states that exempt from these Guidelines are \"certain specified recombinant DNA molecules that consist entirely of DNA segments from different species that exchange DNA by known physiological processes, though one or more of the segments may be a synthetic equivalent. A list of such exchangers will be prepared and periodically revised by the Director, NIH, with advice of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, after appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment (see Section IV-E-1-b- ()-{d).) Certain classes are exempt as of publication of these Revised Guidelines. The list is in Appendix A.\" Under exemption I-E-4 of these revised Guidelines are recombinant DNA molecules that are (1) composed entirely of DNA segments from one or more of the organisms within a sublist and (2) to be propagated in any of the organisms within a sublist.

Appendix C-Exemptions Under I-E-5 Section I-E-5 states that exempt from these Guidelines are \"Other classes of recombinant DNA molecules, if the Director, NIH, with advice of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, after appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment, finds that they do not present a significant risk to health or the environment. (See Section IV-E--1- b-(1)-(d}.) Certain classes are exempt as of publication of these Revised Guidelines.\" Under exemption I-E-5 of these Revised Guidelines are those recombinant DNA ipolecules that are propagated and maintained in cells in tissue culture and that are derived entirely from non-viral components (that is, no component is derived from a eukaryotic virus).Appendix D-HV1 and HV2 Host- Vector Systems Assigned Containment Levels as Specified in the Subsections of Section III-A As noted above at the beginning of Section IIl-A, certain HVI and HV2 host-vector systems are assigned containment levels as specified in the subsections of Section III-A. Those so classified as of publication of these Revised Guidelines are listed below. * HV1-The following specified strains of Neurospora crassa which have been modified to prevent FS 590, UCLAI01 (these are conidial separation mutants). (3) eas strain UCLA191 (an \"easily wettable\" mutant). HV1-Asporogenic mutant derivatives of B. subtilis. These derivatives must not revert to sporeformers with a frequency greater than 10-7; data confirming this requirement must be presented to NIH for certification. The following plasmids are accepted as the vector components of certified RUB 331 and BGSC 1S53 have been certified as the host component of HV1 systems based on these plasmids. HV2-The asporogenic mutant derivative of Bacillus subtilis, ASB298, with Guidelines As noted in the subsections of Sections IV-E-l-b-(1) and IV-E-l-b-(2), the Director, NIH, may take certain actions with regard to the Guidelines after consideration by the RAC. Some of the actions taken to date include the following: 1. The following experiment has been approved: The cloning in B. subtilis, under P2 conditions, of DNA derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae using EK2 plasmid vectors provided that an HVI B. subtilis host is used. 2. Unmodified laboratory strains of Neurospora crassa can be used in all \"These follow the assigned containment levels as specified in the subsections of Section Ill-A sith one exception. This exception is that experiments involving complete genomes of eukar*ottc viruses will require P3 + HVI or P2 + HV2 rather than the levels given in the subsections of Secion Ill-A.experiments for which HVI N. crassa systems are approved provided that these are carried out at physical containment one level higher than required for HVI. However, if P3 containment is specified for HVl N. crassa, this level is considered adequate for unmodified N. crassa. For P2 physical containment, special care must be exercised to prevent aerial dispersal of macroconidia. including the use of a biological safety cabinet. 3. P2 physical containment shall be used for DNA recombinants produced between members of the Actinamycetes group except for the species which are known to be pathogenic for man, animals, or plants. 4. Cloned desired fragments from any non-prohibited source may be transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing a Ti plasmid (or derivatives thereof), using a nonconjugative E. coliplasmid vector coupled to a fragment of the Ti plasmid and/or the origin of replication of an Agrobacterium plasmid, under containment conditions one step higher than would be required for the desired DNA in HVI systems (i.e. one step higher physical containment than that specified in the subsections of Section III-A). Transfer into plant parts or cells in culture would be permitted at the same containment level (one step higher). 5. Bacillus subtilis strains that do not carry an asporogenic mutation can be used as hosts specifically for the cloning of DNA derived from E. coliK-1Z and Streptomyces coelicolor, S. aureofaciens, S.

OMB's \"Mandatory information Requirements for Federal Assistance Program Announcements\" (45 FR 39592) requires a statement concerning the official government program contained in the Catalog of Federal DomesticAssistance. Normally NIH lists In its annoucements the number and title of affected individual programs for the guidance77408 Federal Register / Vol. 45, No. 227 / Friday, November 21, 1980 / Notices of the public. Because the guidance in this notice covers not only virtually every NIH program but also essentially every federal research program in which DNA recombinant molecule techniques could be used. it has been determined to be not cost effective or in the public interest to attempt to list these programs. Such a list would likely require several additional pages. In addition, NIH could not be certain that every federal program would be included as many federal agencies, as well as private organizations, both national and international, have elected to follow the NIH Guidelines. In lieu of the individual program listing. NIH invites readers to direct questions to the information address above about whether individual programs listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance are affected. NIH programs are not covered by OMB Circular A-95 because they fit the description of \"program not considered appropriate\" in Section 8-[b)-[4] and [5) of that Circular. [FR Doc. 80-36316 "}
