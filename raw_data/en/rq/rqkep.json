The [Scientific Research Deanship](https://srd.qu.edu.sa) has recently released its 5-years Scientific Research Strategy for 2020-2025, which was set on the university's capabilities in line with national priorities and regional challenges and opportunities. The activities and outputs of the strategy include pioneering research activities that foster innovation and entrepreneurship, support the process of continuous development and improvement in academic programs, support for research skills, develop their activities and improve them to serve the community. Ten major priorities in different fields were set for the research strategy summarized as follow: - Sustainable and value chain research in agricultural and veterinary sciences This priority addresses the sustainability of agricultural and animal health. Research activities under this priority deal with many topics such as industrial transfer of dates, recycling of date palm waste to valuable products, production of biofertilizers and biocontrol agents, and the development of local strains of broiler and laying hens. It also involves camel heath and production, mass production of natural enemies to eliminate the effect of destructive pests and reduce the use of harmful chemical pesticides, as well as finding effective ways to rationalize irrigation water and conserve water resources. All activities proposed in this priority are in line with international research and development trends (R&D) and targeting the goals stated by United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Outcomes of this research priority will enhance the global R&D trends through different means such as increase healthy farm products resulted in improving public health, reduction of environment contamination, and other. - Prevention and control of non-communicable diseases This priority addresses noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) as a global health, and facilitates research on prevention of NCDs and improvement of health care. - Sustainable Developments in the Energy, Water, and Environmental Engineering Sectors Energy and water systems have often been treated as a separate system over the entire pathway from production to consumption. However, their close interdependence requires some perspective of the water-energy nexus, especially in regions with very high water stresses combined with a myriad of rapid changes in resource production and consumption. The proposed research areas within this priority address 7 out of 17 Goals of Sustainable Development established by UN to transform our world including clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, industry, innovation, and infrastructure, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, climate action, and life below water - Management of common Infectious Diseases Infectious diseases considered a significant public health concern and cause considerable socioeconomic problems worldwide. So, this priority addresses the fundamental issues that are continuing to cause both health and economic problems in the country and try to minimize the spread of various communicable diseases transmitted from animal to human or from human to human; through the development of vaccines to prevent and manage the spread of disease. Also, as Infectious disease can spread from person to person and can travel from county to country, this priority is intended to reduce the burden of global infectious diseases through the management and control of the infectious diseases common in Saudi Arabia as well as by working with international partners. - Proposed approaches for Cybersecurity towards KSA Digital transformation One of the main pillars of Kingdom 2030 vision is the digital transformation, which creates a wide use and reliance on the technology, yet give a rise to the risk of cybercrimes/cyberattacks. Therefore, cybersecurity researches becomes one of the most important subjects that are under consideration around the world by governments, businesses and academia. In this research priority, Qassim University aims to perform multiple Cybersecurity research activities to enhance cybersecurity on the digital transformation. These activities include developing intrusion detection systems, access control and privacy protection and frameworks for analyzing the implementation of the cybersecurity regulation in Saudi Arabia and the big data security analytics. Moreover, the university aims to establish several collaborative MSc programs with international universities in USA and UK which can focus on cybersecurity R&D trends. - Innovative Biotechnology and nanotechnology for a healthy life Biotechnology and nanotechnology are disciplines that developed from the interaction of physical sciences, molecular engineering, biology, chemistry, and biotechnology, and holds major advances in pharmaceuticals and health care in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of various disease. Biotechnology and nanotechnology research is a promising field that can generate income, and can initially focus on the improvement of dangerous diseases treatment. Globally, nanoparticles have become part of daily life as they found in fertilizers, and cosmetics, for instance. Given the breadth of the potential applications, nanotechnology has become a research priority for many countries, as shown by the UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 in. Thus, the outcome of this research priority will focus directly on bettering the health of chronic disease patients such as cancer patients, etc. around the globe. - Development of Smart Cities More than half of the world's population lives in cities today, with that figure set to rise over the coming decades. There is a pressure on cities to provide better and more efficient infrastructures and services. To address the growing demand from residents to deliver a better quality of life, cities should rely on information and communications technology, infrastructure and intelligent devices or what so called smart cities, where cities integrates the quality of life for its citizens, the energy-efficient, the local economy, transport, traffic management, environment, public safety and interaction with government for future cities developments. This research priority aims to pave the way for improving the quality of life in Saudi Arabia, and the globe. The university has the capacity in terms of highly-qualified researchers having multi-disciplinary research teams from different applied sciences departments to achieve sustainable smart cities with strategies that focus on autonomous Security/Safety Systems, Physical Infrastructure and Efficient use of Energy Resources, ultimately responding to the physical, social and safety needs of the citizens. - Application-based Intelligent Analytics for Problem Solving Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has received an increasing interest of researchers and institutions. Different applications of AI in different domains (such as healthcare, industry, military, ... etc) provide efficient solutions and improvements. With the recent local and world-wide interest in AI domain, this research priority aims at solving and directly augments many inherent KSA problems using Machine Learning, Computer Vision, optimally processing big data, big data tools and techniques, deep Learning, image-based solutions, data science for security and the Internet of Things (IoT) domains. All the activities in this priority are trying to solve real-world problems, which is an inherent theme of the AI and the Data Science paradigm. - Increase the internal capability of researchers and research staff to perform excellent research - Roadmap for Sustainable Development of Qassim Region Explore rankings data for Qassim University Key statistics - 10.2No. of students per staff(1) - 6%Percentage of International Students(1) - 62 : 38Student Ratio of Females to Males(1) - 42,159Number of FTE Students(1) Subjects taught at Qassim University Physical sciences - Geology, Environmental, Earth & Marine Sciences - Physics & Astronomy - Chemistry - Mathematics & Statistics Clinical, pre-clinical & health - Other Health - Medicine & Dentistry Social sciences - Sociology - Geography Arts & humanities - Architecture - History, Philosophy & Theology - Languages, Literature & Linguistics - Art, Performing Arts & Design Business & economics - Business & Management - Accounting & Finance - Economics & Econometrics Psychology - Psychology Life sciences - Sport Science - Agriculture & Forestry - Biological Sciences - Veterinary Science Computer science - Computer Science Law - Law Engineering & technology - Electrical & Electronic Engineering - Civil Engineering - General Engineering - Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering - Chemical Engineering Education - Education "}
