It is based on the belief that living beings have a vital energy, called \"qi\", that circulates through twelve invisible energy lines known as meridians on the body. Each meridian is associated with a different organ system. An imbalance in the flow of qi throughout a meridian is how disease begins. These energy lines are connected by over 1,000 points on the body. During your session, these points are activated or stimulated by your acupuncturist using needling, moxibustion, cupping, electrostimulation, and often accompanied by the use of herbal medicine. Acupuncture is a holistic medical system, which means it is meant to treat the entire body, even if you want to target a specific health issue. Conditions commonly treated by acupuncture include: migraines and tension headaches sinusitis common cold addictions including quitting smoking trigeminal neuralgia meniere's disease tennis elbow sciatica insomnia anxiety arthritis menstrual cramps fibromyalgia low back pain asthma weight loss infertility and many more conditions and symptoms How Acupuncture Works There are numerous theories about how acupuncture works. Some of them are: acupuncture stimulates the release of pain-relieving endorphins acupuncture influences the release of neurotransmitters, substances that transmit nerve impulses to the brain acupuncture influences the autonomic nervous system acupuncture stimulates circulation acupuncture influences the electrical currents of the body What a Typical Acupuncture Treatment is Like Before the initial appointment, patients usually complete a health history questionnaire. The acupuncturist then interviews the patient, asking about his or her primary health concerns, lifestyle habits, diet, emotions, menstrual cycle, sleep, temperature, appetite, stress, and sensitivity to foods, temperature, and seasons. During the interview, the acupuncturist examines the client carefully, noting his or her face color, voice, and tongue color and coating. There are also three pulse points at the wrist of each hand that the acupuncturist will assess to further determine the health of the 12 meridians. After the interview, the acupuncturist gives a diagnosis and begins treatment. Typically the acupuncturist will use 6-12 needles during the treatment. The number of needles used does not correspond with the intensity of the treatment, rather it is the precise placement of the needles that is important. Upon insertion, the client may feel a slight sting or prick. Once the needle is inserted there should be no pain. You should feel comfortable during the treatment. Treatment length varies from seconds to longer than one hour. The typical length is about 20 to 30 minutes. The acupuncturist may use the following techniques during the treatment: moxibustion - heating of acupuncture needles with dried herb sticks to activate and warm the acupuncture point. Also known as \"moxa.\" cupping - the application of glass cups to create a suction on the skin. This is to relieve stagnation of qi and blood, e.g. in sports injury. herbal medicine - Chinese herbs may be given in the form of teas, pills, and capsules to supplement acupuncture treatment. electrostimulation - provides electrical stimulation to two to four acupuncture needles. Can be used for pain relief and muscle pain. laser acupuncture - non-needle stimulation of acupuncture points. Call now to make an appointment - "}
