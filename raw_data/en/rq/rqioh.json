At the time, Meldy Cojuangco was still alive. Also, some information and photos in this feature first appeared in the July 2006 issue of Tatler Philippines, in the article entitled Imelda Cojuangco: The Face of Grace. Like other social orders, Philippine society goes through continuous evolution. Belles of the ball and \"It\" girls come and go, and men of the hour\u2014as their name suggests\u2014spend but a few precious moments in the limelight. However, high society does have its mainstays, a select group of people whose names alone instil all-around respect, the kind that withstands the passing of time and the fickleness of human affection. Meldy Cojuangco is one of these bastions. So pervasive is her influence in high society that in any social affair, the conversation will, at one point or another, turn to her\u2014even without her in attendance. These days it's usually to inquire after her health, how the legendary socialite is coping with the twilight years. Often it's just to sing her praises. \"She's a woman with a golden heart and golden pockets,\" one friend says. Another immediately joins in: \"Yes, Meldy is one of the most generous people I know.\" People seem to have only kind words for her. While Meldy's power was given to her by the strength of her pedigree coupled with wealth passed down for generations, the love her peers and employees have for her can be credited to her grace and her devotion to a good Catholic life.
