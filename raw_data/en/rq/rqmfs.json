Immunize for a better life! Parents and health care professionals are the key to protecting adolescents from HPV cancers. January 2017WHAT IS HPV? HPV is a virus almost everyone will be infected with at some point in their lives. HPV is spread through sexual contact and can be spread even when an infected person has no signs or symptoms. In most cases, HPV infection goes away on its own and people infected with the virus never knew they had it. However, when HPV does not go away, it can cause health problems such as genital warts and cancer. Cancer often takes years to develop after a person is infected with HPV. HPV can have many serious consequences in both men and women including: CERVICAL CANCER VULVAR CANCER VAGINAL CANCER ANAL CANCER PENILE CANCER OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER (cancer in the back of the throat, including the base of the tongue and tonsils ) GENITAL WARTS RECURRENT RESPIRATORY PAPILLOMATOSIS (RRP) (a rare condition in which warts grow in the throat) About 79 million Americans are currently infected with HPV, and 14 million people become newly infected each year. Approximately 33,000 HPV-associated cancers occur annually in the U.S., including 12,600 HPV-associated cancers in males. The American Cancer Society (ACS) projects 12,000 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will occur in the U.S. and about 4,000 women will die from the disease each year. Worldwide, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women and is estimated to cause more than 470,000 new cases and 233,000 deaths each year. HOW MANY DOSES ARE NEEDED AND ON WHAT SCHEDULE? The HPV vaccine consists of either a two- or three-dose series over a six-month period and can be administered at the same time as other vaccines. A complete HPV vaccine series is necessary to provide full protection. The vaccine works best and produces a higher immune response in preteens (11-12 years of age) than it does in older teens and young adults. IS THE HPV VACCINE SAFE? The HPV vaccine is safe and effective. The rst HPV vaccine was available in 2006, and since then, more than 40 million doses of vaccine have been administered. There have been no serious safety concerns associated with HPV vaccination. However, like any medication, vaccines can cause some side effects. The most common side effects from the HPV vaccine are minor and include soreness or swelling where the vaccine was given, low-grade fever or headache. Such minor symptoms are normal and should be expected as the body builds immunity. Serious reactions are very rare. Vaccines are held to the highest standard of safety. The U.S. has the safest, most effective vaccine supply in history. Years of testing are required by law before a vaccine can be licensed. Once in use, vaccines are continually monitored for safety and effectiveness. Anyone who receives a vaccine should be fully informed about both the benets and the risks. Any questions or concerns should be discussed with your health care provider. IS HELP AVAILABLE FOR THE COST OF VACCINES? Check to see if your health insurance covers the HPV vaccine. If your child does not have health insurance or does not have insurance that covers vaccines, ask your health care provider about the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. The VFC program provides vaccines to eligible children from birth through 18 years of age. YOUR CHILD'S IMMUNIZATION RECORD It is important to keep immunization records in a safe place. Proof of immunizations may be necessary throughout life. The Iowa Department of Public Health does not maintain historical paper immunization records. However, immunization records can be entered into a permanent statewide electronic database called Iowa's Immunization Registry Information System (IRIS). IRIS contains a public record access feature that allows parents or adults to search for their own or their child's immunization record at https://iris.iowa.gov. If records are not found, ask your health care provider to enter your immunization record into IRIS. HPV CAUSES CANCER in 33,000 Americans yearly \u2014 that's 1 person approximately every 16 minutes. HPV PREVENTION The HPV vaccine is the best protection against the most common types of human papillomavirus. The vaccine offers the greatest health benets to individuals who complete the series prior to any exposure to HPV. Health care professionals recommend routine vaccination of boys and girls at 11 or 12 years of age with catch-up vaccination for older adolescents and young adults. "}
