As the temperature goes down, people can have all sorts of issues such as cold, cough, flu etc. These are caused due to a weak immune system. This is a result of aggravated Vata and Kapha doshas in the body. With the changing seasons, the strength of the body also changes. Every season calls for a unique regime and diet to deal with the outside temperature. Here is a quote from Charaka Samhita that describes the physiology of human body in the winter season. During winters, we have the strongest digestive power which is due to an increase in fire (Agni ) content of our body, hence this is the time to give nourishment to our body. As said, due to high fire, depriving our body of nutritious food can cause it to burn our own body tissues which can lead to severe diseases and disorders. That's why we commonly see dryness on the skin in winters as the excess fire starts burning the tissues and the water content in our body. So, it is highly recommended to drink enough water to keep away from dryness, pains and itching in winters. According to Ayurveda, if the body is filled with Ama (toxins) and lacks Ojas (the finest product of digestion), then many infections can find their way into the body In this season, our body is more susceptible to disorders like Arthritis, Psoriasis, Depression, Viral fever etc. And all this happens because of low immunity. Winter has a bad name as it is also called the flu season, yet according to Maharishi Ayurveda, winter doesn't have to be the \"season of misery\". Hemant Ritu is actually the best season to improve immunity. It's not at all a weakening season if you know how to use it to strengthen your immunity from within. Apart from all kinds of nutritious foods, the best way to improve Immunity is regular intake of Maharishi Amrit Kalash, especially in the winter season. Amrit Kalash is the King of Rasayanas and it not only prevents infection but also increases longevity for a healthy and better life. To improve your health and immunity, we recommend doing everyday oil massages (Abhyanga) with herbal steam baths and going for detoxification procedures also known as Panchkarma.
