In this context, specifically in India, the homeopathic remedy, Arsenicum Album 30C prepared from arsenic trioxide was widely prescribed and publicly supplied through government agencies among adults and school-going children. Inorganic arsenic, known as the \"king of poisons\" is a highly toxic substance with the potential to cause acute as well as chronic injury to multiple organ systems, mainly skin, lung, liver, and kidneys. Acute liver injury due to arsenic-containing formulations is seldom reported.
