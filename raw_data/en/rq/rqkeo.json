Conventional treatments include [exercise](https://www.forbes.com/health/fitness/benefits-of-exercise/), loss of excess weight, medications and supportive devices such as canes or crutches. However, many people are also be interested in supplements. This article explores some of the supplements often marketed as providing joint pain relief, helping you identify promising options for effective pain management, based on research. What Is Joint Pain (Osteoarthritis)? [Osteoarthritis](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/arthritis/osteoarthritis/) is a chronic and progressive condition that results from wear and tear on the body. The main effects of osteoarthritis are joint space narrowing, cartilage degeneration and, ultimately, bone degeneration, says Emily Scott, D.O., C.A.Q.S.M., of Direct Care Physicians of Pittsburgh and a member of the Allegheny County Medical Society. Osteoarthritis symptoms include deep, achy pain in certain areas of the body (especially with movement), morning stiffness, crepitus (a crackling sound in the joints) and limited range of movement, says Leah Johansen, M.D., a family medicine physician specializing in functional medicine at Lifeforce, an online health optimization platform. 5 Top Supplements for Joint Pain Researchers have studied the effects of the following supplements in people living with osteoarthritis. However, it's important to note that while some supplements may help ease symptoms, they shouldn't be seen as a substitute for physician-prescribed treatment. It's important to always speak with your doctor before adding a new supplement to your routine. Turmeric [Turmeric](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/turmeric-health-benefits/) is a relative of ginger and is often used in traditional Chinese and Indian medicine. When used as a spice, it gives foods like curries their golden hue. Also known as Curcuma longa, turmeric contains curcumin\u2014an anti-inflammatory compound that may help reduce inflammation caused by arthritis, says Dr. Scott, citing a 2022 Frontiers In Immunology systematic review and meta-analysis. The review examines the administration of curcumin and Curcuma longa extract in over 2,000 participants with different types of [arthritis](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/arthritis/arthritis-symptoms/), including osteoarthritis. Curcumin and Curcuma longa extract both showed potential in improving arthritis symptoms and reducing inflammation. Specific to osteoarthritis, curcumin and Curcuma longa extracts had comparable effects to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in reducing joint pain and stiffness and improving function. Additionally, when combined with NSAIDs, curcumin's effects were more notable than with NSAIDs alone. However, researchers note more studies are warranted to draw conclusions [[2]](#footnote_2). Fish Oil Fish oil contains [omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/omega-3-fatty-acids/), essential nutrients that combat inflammation. \"There have been limited studies that have consistently shown [fish oil](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/fish-oil-supplements-benefits/) benefits on joint and cartilage health,\" says Dr. Scott. The Arthritis Foundation echoes this, but also notes that research yields mixed results. On the positive end, a 2016 randomized control trial illustrates that both low and high-dose fish oil may improve symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Interestingly, the group administered low-dose fish oil in the study had greater improvement in function and pain scores compared to the high-dose fish oil group at two years [[3]](#footnote_3). Another 2020 randomized controlled trial shows that fish oil supplementation significantly reduced osteoarthritic pain in participants living with excess weight and [obesity](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/obesity-statistics/) compared with no fish oil supplementation [[4]](#footnote_4). While these studies are promising, optimal treatment protocols around fish oil supplementation have yet to be determined, so more research needs to be done. Chondroitin and Glucosamine Chondroitin and glucosamine are structural components of cartilage, the cushioning tissue around your joints. Chondroitin supplements are typically sourced from animal cartilage, while glucosamine supplements are made from shellfish or vegetable origins. It's been suggested that chondroitin and glucosamine can potentially alleviate joint pain and impede the progression of joint deterioration and cartilage loss, says Dr. Johansen. Chondroitin and glucosamine can be taken individually or in combination. A 2018 meta-analysis found that chondroitin was superior to placebo in alleviating pain and enhancing physical function in participants with osteoarthritis. Additionally, glucosamine exhibited a significant effect on reducing stiffness compared to placebo [[5]](#footnote_5). However, another 2018 meta-analysis examining various supplements for osteoarthritis concluded that chondroitin and glucosamine, as individual supplements, were either ineffective or showed small benefits [[6]](#footnote_6). Recent research on chondroitin and glucosamine for osteoarthritis focuses more on the combination of these two supplements rather than on them individually. A 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that combining chondroitin and glucosamine is more effective than using them individually for treating knee osteoarthritis [[7]](#footnote_7). Collagen [Collagen](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-collagen-powders/) is a protein found in bones, cartilage, muscles, skin and tendons. It helps keep these tissues strong to withstand stretching. Most collagen products on the market are derived from animal sources like skins, tendons, bone and hides. Different types of collagen products have been studied in joint health, with type II collagen and hydrolyzed collagen being the most studied in osteoarthritis. Collagen can help reduce activity-related bone pain and strengthen tendons and ligaments, notes Dr. Johansen, who cites, a 2019 meta-analysis in International Orthopaedics that shows collagen is effective in improving osteoarthritis symptoms [[8]](#footnote_8). However, a 2023 Nutrients review of collagen supplementation for joint health explains that while most collagen ingredients that have been studied seem to be effective, there is a lot of variation in how they've been studied, how much to take and the treatment period [[9]](#footnote_9). Possible Drawbacks of Using Supplements for Joint Pain One possible drawback of using supplements is they may not address the root cause of joint pain, such as musculoskeletal alignment or [dietary aspects](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-anti-inflammatory-foods/), says Dr. Johansen. Supplements also have the potential to interact with specific medications and may pose risks for individuals with certain medical conditions. If you're taking blood-thinning medications, it's advised to avoid turmeric/curcumin and fish oil. Additionally, individuals preparing for surgery or those with gallbladder disease should avoid turmeric/curcumin. It's also important to note that taking chondroitin alongside blood thinners may increase the risk of bleeding. Furthermore, individuals with [glaucoma](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/what-is-glaucoma/) should exercise caution with glucosamine, as it could potentially worsen eye pressure. Always consult your doctor before adding any supplement to your routine, especially if you have a medical condition, advises Dr. Scott. Lastly, it's important to note that supplements aren't regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the same way medications are, and standards can vary among manufacturers, says Dr. Scott. She recommends researching and selecting brands you're familiar with or those recommended by your doctor. When to See a Doctor for Joint Pain \"See a physician early on about joint pain,\" says Dr. Johansen. Dr. Scott agrees, emphasizing that only a physician can conduct a thorough evaluation, determine the underlying cause of joint pain and provide appropriate treatment to prevent further damage.
