Staff members collected, wrote, verified,and coordinated the information to produce the publication. The 2001 edition is a culmination of effort involving many other individuals and departments: the House Research Depart-ment, the House Fiscal Analysis Department, the Office of theChief Clerk, the Index Department, and the Office of the Revisorof Statutes.Introduction The 82nd Session of the Minnesota Legislature convened on Jan. 3, 2001, and adjourned at midnightMay 21, 2001, the last day lawmakers could meet asspecified by the Minnesota Constitution. A total of 59 legislative days were used \u2014 one day short of half the biennial allotment of 120 legislativedays. (A legislative day is counted when a quorum ofeither the House or Senate is present to conductbusiness as a body.) However, the Legislature's work was not finished. Only one omnibus bill conference committee wasable to reach agreement before the constitutionaldeadline. Both the House and Senate approved theearly childhood and family education funding billwith just seconds to spare before midnight. Gov. Jesse Ventura vetoed the bill, leaving all ma- jor budgetary items unfinished. The governor calledthe Legislature into special session June 11, 2001. Itwas the first special session called during Ventura'sterm as governor. Leaders from both the House and Senate negoti- ated with the governor's office for two weeks duringthe special session before reaching a final agreement.State officials began making preparations during Juneto handle a potential government shutdown thatwould have occurred had the budget bills not beenapproved prior to July 1, 2001. The Legislature adjourned the special session dur- ing the early morning hours June 30, 2001. Gov.Ventura signed all the bills that day, and Secretary ofState Mary Kiffmeyer signed the last bill at 11:41 p.m.\u2014 just moments before the start of the fiscal year. The 2001 session was the third round of Minnesota's tripartisan government \u2014 with the state's first Inde-pendence Party governor, a DFL-led Senate, and aRepublican-controlled House of Representatives.Though previous sessions had not required a specialsession, it is not unusual for some budgetary mattersto be settled outside the constitutional bounds of theregular legislative session. There have been 40 specialsessions in the state's history. In 2001, 2,565 bills were introduced in the House and 2,285 in the Senate. During the special session,the House introduced another 35 bills and the Senateintroduced an additional 36. Of the 231 bills andthree resolutions sent to the governor during boththe regular and special sessions, 11 bills were vetoed in full, and portions of five other bills were line-itemvetoed. No vetoes were overridden during 2001. Overall, the list of accomplishments from the 2001 session includes the double-digit tax cuts for allproperty classes; extensions for some Minnesota Fam-ily Investment Program recipients nearing the60-month limit for benefits; funding to provide moreaccess to health insurance for children and adults; afelony drunken driving penalty; a statewide anti-racial profiling plan; and elimination of the state-determined general education levy. New Laws 2001 is divided into five major parts: First, the Highlights section beginning on page 9 is written in an easy-to-read style for those who want aquick overview of legislation approved in 2001. Second, the Vetoed Bills section lists all the bills that were vetoed and line-item vetoed by the gover-nor and synopses of his reasons for doing so. Third, the Bills in Limbo section describes some of the bills discussed in 2001, but not passed by theHouse and Senate. Because this is the first year of thetwo-year spending cycle, these bills remain alive, orviable, for consideration next year. Fourth, the Summary section gives a technical summary of each approved bill as it appeared on thebill when it was sent to the governor. Also included isa listing of all sections of Minnesota Statutes that the bill affects. And fifth, the Index section provides a list of bills by Chapter number, House file number, Senate filenumber, bill title, effective date, and finally, by key-words. Many indexes are included to make it as easyas possible for people to find what they need. If you wish to obtain a copy of a bill, call the House Chief Clerk's Office (651) 296-2314, or the SenateInformation Office (651) 296-2343. Ask for the billby Chapter number, or by the House or Senate filenumber. Bills are also available on the Legislature's World Wide Web site (http://www.house.mn).

The new laws are categorized alpha- betically under topics, such as Agricul-ture, Banking, and Bonding. Where billsfall under more than one topic, crossreferences are cited. Appropriations billsare discussed under the topics to whichthey apply. For easy reference, House file (HF) numbers, Senate file (SF) numbers, andChapter (CH) numbers appear at theend of each highlight. An asterisk aftereither the House file or the Senate fileindicates the version of the bill sent to thegovernor. Stories on major appropria-tions laws include references to articleand section numbers wherever possible.Effective dates are included in most of thestories. The Highlights Subject Index begin- ning on page 149 also is useful for findinginformation on specific subjects. AGRICULTURE# Controlling animal disease outbreaks A new law effective May 26, 2001 authorizes the governor to declare an emergency for thepurpose of controlling dangerous domesticanimal diseases. In such a state of emergency, the Board of Animal Health may establish and enforce quar-antine zones to prevent the spread of disease.Under the new law, board jurisdiction willextend to people, property, and livestock, andwill include the existing authority to order thecondemnation of livestock and carcass dis-posal. Under previous law, the board had theauthority to destroy diseased animals, but couldnot restrict movement of people. The new law permits the board to petition the governor to declare the emergency. In do-ing so, the state 's chief executive could make available all resources normally reserved fornatural disasters, such as floods or tornadoes. Reports of devastating outbreaks of Foot and Mouth Disease in the United Kingdomprompted the new law. Supporters wanted toensure that the state was adequately preparedto quickly suppress an outbreak should it oc-cur in Minnesota.Foot and Mouth Disease is a highly conta- gious viral infection afflicting hoofed animalssuch as cows, pigs, goats, and deer. There are atleast seven strains of the disease which humanscan carry but do not catch. Although fewer than 1 percent of adult ani- mals die as a direct result of the disease, it isfatal for about one-half of young animals. It isalso destructive because it slows animal growth,resulting in smaller and less productive adultanimals. While the virus is transmitted among ani- mals via bodily secretions, it can also be spreadon people 's shoes or other clothing, in human nostrils, in animal products, and even by thewind. Under the new law, the board can also estab- lish quarantine zones of no larger than a three-mile radius from animals believed to be in-fected and for no longer than 72 hours. Withinthe zone, the board can establish rules govern-ing the movement of people, vehicles, or ani-mals. Agriculture officials suggested the 72-hour limit should be sufficient because all af-fected animals should be slaughtered andburned or buried within one day of a positivediagnosis. Rep. Tim Finseth (R-Angus) and Sen. Steve Murphy (DFL-Red Wing) sponsored the law. HF2514*/SF2368/CH192 Altering feedlot inventories A new law will alter the way feedlots are inventoried, modify provisions related to such,and provide for alternative methods of dis-posal of milkhouse process wastewater. Effective May 19, 2001, the new law specifies that farmers whose feedlots have been inven-toried by a county need not duplicate similarregistration activities individually. Rep. William Kuisle (R-Rochester), who sponsored the legislation in the House, said thelaw will assist sustainable agricultural practicesby granting feedlot regulation exemptions toland that remains in pasture. Sustainable agri-cultural practices generally favor small farmsand allow animals to move about open spaces. He explained that \"pasture \" land is legally defined as agricultural land that retains vegeta-tion. Only farmland that has been sufficientlytrampled by livestock to lose its vegetation isregulated as a feedlot. Additionally, the legislation, in part, forbids the state Pollution Control Agency from re-quiring feedlot operators to maintain precipi-tation records as a condition of being granteda feedlot permit, as long as a government agencyor educational institution already collects suchdata. It also requires feedlot permit holders togive notice when they intend to transfer own-ership or control of a feedlot. Also, an animal feedlot in shoreland that has been unused may resume operation after ob-taining a permit, regardless of the number ofyears the feedlot was unused.A new law allows the governor to declare an emergency to control dangerous domestic animal diseases,such as Foot and Mouth disease.PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID10NEW LAWS2001Highlights The new law also allows alternative methods for disposal of milkhouse process wastewatersby a dairy operation of 300 animals or fewer.Included among acceptable alternatives is dis-charge of process wastewaters onto agricul-tural lands, as defined in state statute. Sen. Steve Murphy (DFL-Red Wing) spon- sored the law in the Senate. HF1734/SF1659*/CH128 Fair foundation established The state agricultural society may establish a nonprofit Minnesota State Fair Foundation,under a new law effective Aug. 1, 2001. Federal nonprofit status is defined by U.S. Internal Revenue Code, which specifies thatthe new foundation must benefit and carry outthe purposes of the agriculture society. Under the new law, sponsored in the House by Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris), the foun-dation may \"solicit, receive, hold, invest, and contribute funds and property ... in a manner consistent with the public good. \" The law says that funds received must be primarily used forcapital expenditures and other needs notfunded by other means. Jennings explained that most other major public institutions in Minnesota enjoy the sup-port of affiliated nonprofit foundations. Sen. Dallas Sams (DFL-Staples) sponsored the measure in the Senate. HF406/SF511*/CH85 Veterinary medicine review The complaint review committee of the state Board of Veterinary Medicine will be grantedthe power to issue legally binding cease anddesist orders, under a new law effectiveAug. 1, 2001. Specifically, the board committee may com- pel the stopping of the unauthorized practiceof veterinary medicine, or any actions thatdirectly violate or threaten to violate existinglaw. If the order were contested, the new law provides that a hearing must be held before anadministrative law judge. It also clarifies whenthe hearing must be held, when a decisionmust be rendered, and what happens if nohearing is requested or the accused fails toappear for the hearing. Rep. Lynda Boudreau (R-Faribault), who sponsored the measure in the House, said theboard itself had suggested the need for addi-tional authority to combat unlicensedveterinarians, mostly from other states, ille- gally prescribing medication to farm animals. Boudreau added that existing procedures for countering illegal prescriptions requiredtoo much time to effectively prevent violationsof veterinary guidelines. Sen. Steve Kelley (DFL-Hopkins) sponsored the measure in the Senate. HF1145/SF333*/CH108 Expanding landowner definitions A new law amends the definition of a land- owner to allow farmers to participate in aprogram intended to maximize the environ-mental quality of marginal farmland. Rep. George Cassell (R-Alexandria) spon- sored the measure effective Aug. 1, 2001 in theHouse. He said the Board of Water and SoilResources asked him to support the measure. Under a prior change in corporate farm law, some farmers were ineligible to participate inthe Reinvest in Minnesota plan, a conservationprogram which returns portions of unusedfarmland to native vegetation and restoredwetlands. The new law expands the definition of a landowner as \"an individual or entity that is not prohibited from owning agricultural landunder (state statute) and either owns land or ispurchasing eligible land under a contract fordeed. \" It also increases the payment to landowners for conservation easements and establishmentof cover. The board must now pay a maximumof $200 per acre for limited duration ease-ments and $300 per acre for perpetual ease-ments of native species restoration, up to $600per acre on wetland restoration, and a maxi-mum of $125 per acre for limited durationeasements and $150 per acre for perpetualeasements. Sen. Dennis Frederickson (R-New Ulm) sponsored the legislation in the Senate. HF1481/SF1164*/CH99 Lien clarifications A new law clarifying agricultural liens is effective July 1, 2001. Officials called existing law concerning agri- cultural liens confusing and contradictory.Liens against crops and livestock can be ofseveral types \u2014 the most important of which are liens to ferriers, livestock breeders, thresh-ers, veterinarians, agricultural production in-puts, landlords, and planting crop owners.However, a problem with existing lien law is that a number of these liens each made theclaim of having a higher priority than all othershave. The bill, which adopts recommenda-tions made by the Agricultural Lien Task Forceof the Business Law Section of the MinnesotaState Bar Association, ranks the order priorityof liens against crops and livestock to eliminatesuch confusion. The new law will also repeal a large portion of agricultural lien law and proposes codingfor new language removing ambiguities andproviding more uniform procedures record-ing liens. Rep. Bob Ness (R-Dassel) and Sen. Steve Murphy (DFL-Red Wing) sponsored themeasure. HF285*/SF339/CH57 Education council membership Certain ex officio members of the Minnesota Agriculture Education Leadership Council willhave the option of designating temporary orpermanent replacements that represent thesame constituency, under a new law. The council was created in 1997 to \"develop recommendations to the Legislature and thegovernor and provide review for agricultureeducation programs in Minnesota. \" It is com- posed of 16 members, including lawmakers,representatives from the governor 's cabinet, education officials, private groups, and agri-cultural business leaders. The law also changes the name of the Senate committee represented to the Senate Agricul-ture, General Legislation and Veteran 's Affairs Committee, instead of Agriculture and RuralDevelopment. Finally, the law extends the sunset date of the council by one year to June 30, 2003. Rep. Bob Ness (R-Dassel), who sponsored the bill in the House, said council membersneeded the freedom to designate replacementsdue to the distance between meeting placesand leaders ' homes. Sen. Steve Dille (R-Dassel) sponsored the law in the Senate. It is effective March 9, 2001.

Jesse Ventura, will urge the United States Postal Service tocreate a postage stamp reproducing a famousphotograph created by a Minnesotan early inthe 20th Century. In the photograph, an elderly man sits pen- sively with bowed head and folded hands at atable holding a pair of spectacles on top of aBible, a bowl of gruel, a loaf of bread, and aknife. Eric Enstrom shot the famous image in his studio in Bovey in 1918. As the black and whitephotograph entitled \"Grace \" became more popular, Enstrom 's daughter Rhoda Nyberg began hand painting the prints in oil. Rep. Loren Solberg (DFL-Bovey), House sponsor of the measure, said the print becameso popular that Enstrom eventually sold thecopyright to the Augsburg Publishing House. The resolution was carried on behalf of a group of citizens in Grand Rapids and Bovey. The Senate sponsor was Sen. Bob Lessard (Ind-Int 'l Falls). HF1391*/SF1318/R3 A resolution urging the United States Postal Service to create a stamp of a famous photo created inMinnesota was signed by Gov. Jesse Ventura. \"Grace\" was photographed in Bovey, Minn., in 1918.PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEIDBANKING# Money transmitter licensing Money transmitters \u2014 non-banks that sell or issue money transfers and payment instru-ments \u2014 will soon be required to be licensed, under a new law. The new law prohibits those selling money orders or traveler 's checks, wiring money, or doing electronic transfers from doing businesswithout a license after Jan. 1, 2002. Before thebill was signed, Minnesota was one of eightstates that did not specifically license this activ-ity, according to documents from Traveler 'sExpress Company, Inc., which supported the legislation. Officials were concerned that these busi- nesses, which often handle large sums of moneyfor consumers, were not subject to license orspecific oversight. The new law, dubbed the Minnesota MoneyTransmitters Act, establishes a $4,000 initial application fee for licensure. The annual li-cense renewal fee will be $2,500, which must beaccompanied by an informational report thatincludes the most recent audited financial state-ment. The new law also requires licensees to bebonded for at least $50,000, have a minimum12NEW LAWS2001Highlights net worth of $100,000, and pass a criminal background check. License fees cover the cost for regulating the transmitters. The state Department of Com-merce will oversee the businesses and performthat regulation. Under the law, the commercecommissioner has the same rights to conductfinancial examinations as the commissionerhas with respect to banks. Also, if the licenseeis found to be in hazardous financial condi-tion, the commissioner is permitted to ask acourt to appoint a receiver to take control ofthe licensee 's assets. The law is sponsored by Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville) and Sen. Steve Kelley (DFL-Hopkins). HF1311/SF1485*/CH148 New financial institution provisions A new law makes technical changes to laws regulating financial institutions. Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville) sponsored the measure, which was suggested by the stateDepartment of Commerce. Under previous law, a financial institution did not have to obtain the approval of thecommissioner in order to invest in propertyand buildings for its own use if the total valuewere less than 50 percent of its existing capitalstock and surplus. The institution had theability to increase that to 75 percent with ap-proval of the commissioner. The new lawchanges the 75 percent variance limit to100 percent, effective May 1, 2001. Unstaffed after-hours drop boxes will no longer be treated as separate branch offices ofa bank, even if they are not located within 1,500feet of the main office or branch, under thenew law. This section is effective Aug. 1, 2001. The new law also includes two provisions for state-chartered banks. The first, effectiveAug. 1, 2001, will no longer require these banksto file stockholder lists annually with the com-missioner of commerce. The second, effectiveMay 1, 2001, removes the requirement thatbanks that do not have federal deposit insur-ance must file stockholder lists annually withthe county recorder. All Minnesota banks arerequired to have federal deposit insurance. With the approval of the commissioner, banks or trust companies may now invest50 percent, instead of 25 percent as was for-merly in law, of a bank 's or trust company 's stock or surplus in a subsidiary. The new lawalso changes the definition of a subsidiary from50 percent ownership to 20 percent owner-ship. This section is effective May 1, 2001.As of Aug. 1, 2001, mortgage originators will be required to keep copies of advertisementsthey use for 26 months. In addition, the timeframe for a disclosure to a mortgage loan cus-tomer changes from 72 hours to three businessdays, effective May 1, 2001. The Senate version of the law was sponsored by Sen. James Metzen (DFL-South St. Paul).

Effective July 1, 2001, the law allows the state to borrow money to fund several improve-ment projects considered to be high priority. The Legislature typically produces its main bonding legislation in the second year of thebiennium, but smaller measures may be passedin year one of a session. Gov. Jesse Ventura line-item vetoed one appropriation to acquire land for a St. Paulproject (see related story, page 89). Rep. Jim Knoblach (R-St. Cloud) and Sen. Keith Langseth (DFL-Glyndon) sponsored thelegislation. 2001 Special Session HF8*/SF25/CH12Environmental projects Nearly $51.5 million will be bonded to ac- quire easements and implement conservationpractices on frequently flooded cropland andon drained or altered wetlands in theMinnesota River Basin. Federal funds are available for the Conser- vation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP),which is designed to protect soil while enhanc-ing water quality and supporting wildlife habi-tats. However, federal dollars require a statematch. In 1994 the Legislature authorized $90 mil- lion in bonds over a 10-year period for theclosed landfill cleanup program. The 2001bonding law re-appropriates a $20.5 millionallocation cancelled by the report that cancelsunused bonds after four years. The law bonds $2 million to acquire land for wetlands or restore wetlands to be used toreplace wetlands drained or filled as a result ofthe repair, maintenance, or rehabilitation ofexisting state roads. The Board of Water andSoil Resources is permitted to enter into agree-ments to acquire land, restore and create wet-lands, and to acquire existing wetland bankingcredits with money from this appropriation. Disaster relief The city of Eagan will receive $5 million and Austin $2 million to pay costs not covered byfederal disaster programs for publicly ownedcapital improvements, including storm drain-age system improvements, acquisition, reloca-tion, and other accountability measures.(Art. 1, Sec. 8)13Highlights NEW LAWS2001 An additional $2 million is allocated to the commissioner of natural resources for grantsto local units of government for publicly ownedcapital improvements to assist with the cost ofmitigative storm drainage system improve-ment and other flood mitigation efforts. Ofthat money, $234,000 is appropriated forprojects in the Red River Basin. School buildings A $19 million maximum effort loan is avail- able for a school district with buildings theDepartment of Children, Families and Learn-ing will not allow to continue to operate givenidentified air quality and structural problems.The law states the East Central School District(Sandstone) may apply to the department forthe loan to help create one K-12 facility. Students attending the Crosswinds Middle School in Woodbury will have a finished schoolbuilding in the fall, due in part to the law,which allocates $1.7 million for the school tocomplete construction and furnishing of thefacility. The Crosswinds school was funded in the 2000 bonding law at less than its request. If theschool had not received additional fundingother options considered included privatefunding or short-term borrowing. \"I don 't think it 's good public policy to have a school building completed, programs readyto go, children ready to move into the building,and have it not be habitable, \" said Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville). The 2001 bonding law contained $1.7 million in funds for the East Metro, inter-district Crosswinds MiddleSchool in Woodbury to finish construction and furnish a new school building.PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID Other projects The law bonds $10 million to match federal funds, which will be used to replace or rehabili-tate local deficient bridges. Funds may be usedfor preliminary engineering and environmen-tal studies, abandoning an existing bridge thatis in need of replacement, but will not bereplaced, and construction of a road to facili-tate the abandonment of an existing bridgedeemed deficient if that is more cost efficientthan replacing the bridge. The commissioner of administration will receive $2.2 million to complete tuckpointing,masonry repair and associated interior repairson the State Office Building, and $1.2 millionto upgrade the primary electrical distributionsystem in the capitol complex. Bridging health care A new law effective May 1, 2001 will assure funding in the coming year for the GilletteChildren 's Specialty Healthcare center 's addi- tion and renovation. The law switches the source of the hospital 's 2000 appropriation from bonds to cash. Thatis balanced by authorizing bonding for thesame amount \u2014 $7 million \u2014 for a portion of the 2000 transportation finance act appropria-tion for local bridge replacement andrehabilitation. According to the House Majority Leader Tim Pawlenty (R-Eagan), the House sponsorof the measure, the St. Paul facility is more than 100 years old and in need of immediate atten-tion. \"The place is overwhelmed, \" he said.

Dubbedthe Accountancy Act of 2001, the law is effec-tive Jan. 1, 2003. The State Board of Accountancy will be required to adhere to new, more detailed, stan-dards for the examination it administers forCertified Public Accountants (CPAs). The newlaw will alter the experience and educationalrequirements for the certificate to be a CPAand will also require the board to consult withMinnesota colleges and universities to developeducational standards. Now, certificates cannot be issued for more than one year. Prior law did not limit theduration of certificates and licenses. The new legislation will also allow residents in other states to receive a certificate if theymeet certain education requirements and havefour years of experience. Licensed Public Accountants (LPAs) will be grandfathered in as CPAs, under the law. Un-der previous law, all owners and partners of aCPA firm had to be CPAs. The new law willrequire that only a majority of the owners and partners must be CPAs. The law was sponsored by Rep. Doug Stang (R-Cold Spring) and Sen. John Hottinger(DFL-Mankato). HF661/SF859*/CH109Special dealer sales opportunities A new law will allow motor vehicle dealerships to add a new horse-powered itemto their offerings. Effective Aug. 1, 2001, a dealer may establish a temporary place of business outside thecounty where it maintains its licensed locationto sell horse trailers without obtaining an addi-tional license. Such a business will also be allowed to do the same for recreational vehicles given that cer-tain conditions are met. For example, the salecan be no more than four times per year, for nolonger than 12 consecutive days. In addition,each location other than a county fair or thestate fair in the seven-county Twin Cities met-ropolitan area must be established jointly withat least four other recreational dealers, or ifoutside the seven-county area, with one otherdealer, and the dealer must notify the registrarof motor vehicles of each location. Rep. William Kuisle (R-Rochester) spon- sored the measure in the House. He said anindustry group brought the bill to his attentionand requested his assistance in changing law toallow for short-term shows. Sen. Steve Murphy (DFL-Red Wing) spon- sored the measure in the Senate. HF1821/SF1666*/CH151 Auto dealer franchises A new law will define unfair trade practices by automobile manufacturers, distributors, orfactories. Effective Aug. 1, 2001, the law will define as unfair the practice of refusing to allow a dealerto transfer a dealership to a qualified transfereeof the dealer's own choosing. \"Under current law, manufacturers can ex- ercise a first right of refusal and essentially takeaway a transaction from a willing buyer and awilling seller,\" said Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville), House sponsor. The new law will allow manufacturers to prohibit the sale of a dealership if the transfereeis not a person of good moral character ordoesn't meet the franchisor's existing stan-dards. Dealers could not exercise their right torefuse a deal if the ownership transfer wereproposed among family members or involveda dealership manager with at least four yearsexperience. Under the new law, denials of requests to transfer ownership must be delivered to thedealer within 60 days after the manufacturerreceives an application requesting an owner- ship transfer. Previous law gave 60 days afterthe manufacturer receives all information itneeds to evaluate the transferee. According to McElroy, industry officials suggested problems with previous law govern-ing the sale of dealerships and requested thenew law to solve those problems. Sen. Don Betzold (DFL-Fridley) sponsored the measure in the Senate. HF779*/SF823/CH62 Equipment buyback changes A new law will change requirements regard- ing the relationship between farm implementdealers and manufacturers. Effective Aug. 1, 2001, the new law will specifically add outdoor power equipment to alist of equipment that manufacturers andwholesalers must repurchase from dealers withwhom they have cancelled a sales agreement.The law limits the definition of outdoor powerequipment to specifically exclude motorcycles,boats, and other vehicles. Among other changes, the new law will also15Highlights NEW LAWS2001 shorten the existing 90-day period during which the repurchase must occur to 60 days. Addi-tionally, the percentage of the current pricethat the manufacturer is required to pay thedealer for returned equipment is increasedfrom 85 percent to 95 percent. The remaining 5 percent would cover the cost of moving the equipment to another deal-ership. Equipment dealers supported the law. The new law will also extend the buyback requirement to data processing and commu-nications software and hardware, specializedrepair tools, and signage purchased to meetrequirements set by wholesalers ormanufacturers. Rep. Bob Gunther (R-Fairmont) and Sen. Dallas Sams (DFL-Staples) were the sponsors. HF933*/SF983/CH72 Hawking license repealed In 1911 Minnesota experienced an increased population, as many people migrated to thestate. In an effort to lend some legitimacy toevery day business transactions that came withthose people, the Legislature passed a law re-quiring a person engaging in hawking or ped-dling wares to be licensed by the county. Ninety years later lawmakers decided it was time to repeal that law, effective Aug. 1, 2001,as part of an effort to remove obsolete lawsfrom the books. The peddling and hawking license law re- quired individuals to file an application withthe county auditor specifying whether the in-tent was to carry on business by wagon, bysome other vehicle, or on foot. A license issued to a person using a wagon or other vehicle \"drawn by two or more horses orother beasts of burden\" had a fee of $35. If anautomobile or \"vehicle or conveyance pro-pelled by any mechanical power\" was used, thelicense fee was $50. A person conducting busi-ness on foot, by means of a pack, basket, orother means cost $7.50. A person who failed to exhibit a license when requested by a law enforcement official wasguilty of a misdemeanor. A separate law allowing statutory cities to regulate hawkers and peddlers remains ineffect. Rep. Mark Buesgens (R-Jordan) and Sen. Claire (R-Prior Lake) were the spon-sors of the measure.

The measure, which features nearly $606 million in direct appropriations, includ-ing $544 million from the general fund, iseffective July 1, 2001, unless otherwise noted. Gov. Jesse Ventura vetoed a similar bill at the end of the 2001 regular session because itlacked a plan for childcare consolidation andbecause the omnibus tax bill remained in ne-gotiation. A House proposal to begin childcareconsolidation was presented to the workinggroup, but was eventually rejected. Neverthe-less, Ventura did not veto any portion of thespecial session bill. Rep. Barb Sykora (R-Excelsior) and Sen. Becky Lourey (DFL-Kerrick) sponsored thelegislation. Here are some highlights. 2001 Special Session: HF4*/SF5/CH3Dollars and cents As a general overview, the law includes $429.8 million in direct appropriations forchildren and family support, $105 million inself-sufficiency and lifelong learning catego-ries, $49.7 million in prevention, and$21.3 million for libraries. More specifically, the law provides increases in adult basic education (to $66.9 million) andforecasted childcare programs ($160.9 million),the latter of which serves people who receive aidfrom the Minnesota Family Investment Pro-gram (MFIP). The law also reflects an antici-pated $4 per child increase in early childhoodand family education funding, a provision thatwas modified during the 1999 session. A boost of$9 million in new federal Temporary Assistancefor Needy Families (TANF) funds will go tochildcare via the Basic Sliding Fee. In addition to keeping Head Start funding at previous levels of $18.38 million annually, thelaw calls for childcare funding to remain atcurrent levels other than the increase in TANFfunding. (Art. 1, Sec. 17-19; Art. 3, Sec. 9) A new provision affecting community edu- cation funding is also part of the law. Begin-ning in fiscal year 2002, a local school districtmay choose to levy additional dollars in prop-erty taxes to support community educationafter-school programming. With funding avail-able in fiscal year 2003 a district operating ayouth after-school enrichment program wouldreceive a minimum of $2,470 up to a maxi-mum of $172,604 based on population. Thetotal cost of this expansion, if fully activated, isestimated at $5 million per year. (Art. 2,Sec. 13) Prevention The law also provides money for programs that seek to minimize risk behavior in youthand to promote safe communities. A $191,000grant to the Guard Our Youth program, thatmakes armories available for youth, after-school, and community education programs,was approved. (Art. 2, Sec. 16) The law calls for the creation of a 22- member council to advise the commissioner ofthe Department of Children, Families andLearning on the implementation and the con-tinued operations of the children's trust fundand the abused child program. The council,which is the merging of two previously existingcouncils, will sunset on June 30, 2005. Amongother duties the council will monitor how andwhere money is spent, assess where funding isneeded, and provide guidance regarding issuesof public awareness and intervention in abuseand neglect situations. CHILDREN#16NEW LAWS2001Highlights The law also extends the ending date for the state interagency coordinating council toJune 30, 2003. The council recommends poli-cies to ensure a comprehensive and coordi-nated system of all state and local agency ser-vices for children under age five with disabili-ties and their families. (Art. 1, Sec. 14) Adult Basic Education Under the new legislation, 2 percent of the state total adult-basic education aid must beset aside for supplemental service grants.(Art. 3, Sec. 4) The law also changes the time when the commissioner of the Department of Children,Families and Learning will conduct financialaudits of programs. Beginning in calendar year 2003, one-half of the adult education programs that receive aidfor fiscal year 2002 will be audited and theother one-half will be audited in 2004. Begin-ning in fiscal year 2005 these programs must beaudited at least once every five years. (Art. 3,Sec. 6) Under the law the ABE policy task force must make recommendations to the Legisla-ture on a funding formula for non-districtprograms based on cost and revenues. TheLegislature must receive the report byFeb. 15, 2002. (Art. 3, Sec. 7) Additionally, the law calls for the hiring of a state adult basic education director, whoseduties will include coordinating the policy taskforce and providing information to the legisla-tive finance committees that oversee adult edu-cation programs. (Art. 3, Sec. 8) Accountability measures The law specifies that districts can no longer keep a large chunk of cash in reserve accounts. Under the new law, the average balance during the most recent three-year period in adistrict 's early childhood family education re- serve account on June 30 each year must not begreater than 25 percent of the district 's early childhood program annual revenue for theprevious year. Any money greater than thattotal will count against state aid for the currentschool year. This is also true of a district 's school readiness reserve account. Both provi-sions are effective with revenue for fiscalyear 2003. (Art. 1, Sec. 8, 12) For forecasting purposes, it also requires the commissioner to report to the Legislature twiceannually information on the actual number offamilies receiving childcare assistance and thecost of direct service. The report must includethe number of families who receive assistanceand number who would receive assistance at various increments of income eligibility andexit levels. (Art. 1, Sec. 16) Libraries For libraries, the most significant change is that the law establishes regional library tele-communications aid of $2.4 million for thebiennium. Regional public libraries may applyfor these funds for data and video access andrelated costs to improve or maintain electronicaccess and connect the library system withinformation infrastructure administered by theDepartment of Administration. This sectionexpires July 1, 2003. Furthermore the law requires the commis- sioner to recommend to the Legislature byFeb. 1, 2002 a permanent method for fundingtelecommunications access as part of the basicsupport grant for public libraries. (Art. 4,Sec. 3, 4) Child welfare changes A new law will make changes to state law governing child placement and other childwelfare issues, effective Aug. 1, 2001. Sponsored by Rep. Kathy Tingelstad (R- Andover) and Sen. Sheila Kiscaden (R-Rochester), the law clarifies and updates pro-visions relating to child protection proceed-ings and child welfare permanency planningfor children in out-of-home placement, andmakes state law conform with certain federallaw requirements. The law, in part, establishes a task force that would review the Uniform Parentage Act of2000 and make recommendations to the Leg-islature by Jan. 15, 2002, as to whether it shouldadopt all or part of the act. The task force will include representatives of 20 different groups including, the Departmentof Health, the Department of Human Services,adoption agencies, lawyers, judges, children 's advocates, and parent organizations. The Uniform Parentage Act of 2000 was drafted by the National Conference of Com-missioners on Uniform State Laws to updatethe 1973 act of the same name. It is a documentintended to be a model for states. The original act addressed the special needs of children born outside of marriage, declaring\"equality for parents and children without re- gard to marital status of the parents. \" Accord- ing to the prefatory note to the new act, it\"contributed much to bringing about a more enlightened approach to some sensitive issuesthat can divide people of goodwill. \" The 2000 act integrates the 1973 act, updates provisions regarding divorce and parentage,acknowledges children of \"assisted concep- tion, \" and includes language regarding genetic testing. Furthermore the new law expands child mal- treatment investigations, including the expan-sion of reporting requirements to schoolboards, and granting the commissioner of thestate Department of Children, Families andLearning access to educational, personal andwelfare data for assessment. This part of the law makes conforming amendments to data classifications and childprotection laws to implement legislation en-acted last biennium that provides for theDepartment of Children, Families and Learn-ing to handle child abuse complaints in educa-tional settings. Other child placement provisions modified in the law include: allowing the commissioners of health and human services to exchange birth recordsand recognitions of parent data to identifychildren subject to threatened injury by aperson responsible for the care of the childand modifies certain requirements relatingto termination of parental rights; adds social services agencies to the list of entities that may enter a relative care agree-ment or other agreement that addresses thesafety and permanency needs of the child;and provides that social services agencies may convene a meeting of a child 's parents and relatives to develop a plan to provide for thesafety and stability of the child any time themeeting is in the best interests of the child.Previously, a meeting could only occur afteran agency assesses a report of neglect orphysical or sexual abuse of a child, and de-termined the child needs protection servicesand a relative care agreement may be in thebest interests of the child.HF1397/SF1394*/CH178 Redefining child neglect (See Crime, page 18) Additional protection for children (See Crime, page 18) Easing payment pains (See Family, page 38) Child support changes (See Family, page 38)17Highlights NEW LAWS2001 Healthy alternatives: Children's health (See Human Services, page 52) Healthy alternatives: Immunizations (See Human Services, page 54) Healthy alternatives: Alternative autism therapies (See Human Services, page 55) Limited bus driving privileges (See Safety, page 68) School bus driver regulations (See Safety, page 69) Early childhood, family education (See Vetoed Bills, page 86) CONSUMERS# Motor vehicle information A new law will permit the Department of Public Safety to release a modified copy of itsaccident records database to the public uponrequest. Effective Aug. 1, 2001, the commissioner may release the information to companies whomeet requirements established in the new lawonly if that company furnishes at least the costof preparing the information \"on a bulk basis. \" The commissioner may not release the follow-ing information: names, driver 's license num- bers, license plate numbers, addresses, andother identifying data. However, under the new law, the depart- ment may release a vehicle license number if abusiness that collects accident and damageinformation for the purposes of buying a ve-hicle certifies it will use the information only toestablish vehicle history regarding its involve-ment in an accident. If the purpose is to iden-tify individuals, then the department is barredfrom releasing the information. Users of the data are expected to be compa- nies that for a fee will provide potential usedvehicle buyers a copy of the vehicle 's accident history. The new law specifies that illegal use of the information constitutes a misdemeanor, a con-viction that carries a sentence of imprison-ment up to 90 days and a $1,000 fine. House sponsor Rep. Tom Workman (R- Chanhassen) said he pursued the measure af-ter considering that he and his 15-year-olddaughter will soon be looking for new cars and all consumers shouldn 't have to wonder the history of individual cars. The law was sponsored in the Senate by Sen. Grace Schwab (R-Albert Lea). HF1830/SF2006*/CH91 Protection for inventors Inventors will have more consumer protec- tion under a new law effective Aug. 1, 2001. Rep. James Clark (R-New Ulm), House spon- sor of the measure, said inventors are some-times scammed by so-called invention devel-opers and \"can pay up-front fees and receive nothing in return. \" The new law makes changes to previous state law regulating invention developers, whichare businesses or individuals that charge a feeto promote a person 's invention. Clark said the Minnesota Inventors Congress, based inRedwood Falls, part of Clark 's legislative dis- trict, found that some inventors were paying$5,000 to $30,000 to \"unscrupulous invention companies \" for invention marketing services and receiving nothing in return. In previous law, invention developers were required to be bonded, but no agency kepttrack of the bond status, Clark said. Under thenew law, the secretary of state 's office is re- quired to maintain a list of all outstandingbonds so that inventors can know whether theinvention development company has a bond. The bond amount is increased from $25,000 to $50,000, and is required for all those adver-tising, rather than only those actually provid-ing, invention development services. \"The need for the increase is that the initial fee can be thatmuch, plus the other charges they expect in-ventors to pay along the way, \" Clark said. Many licensed businesses are required by state law to hold a bond as a guarantee they willprovide the service purchased or advertised. Also, the law will also increase punitive dam- ages from $2,500 to $10,000. The Senate sponsor was Sen. Dennis Frederickson (R-New Ulm).

The new law, sponsored in the House by Rep. Neva Walker (DFL-Mpls), will requirethat the director of the Minnesota Center forCrime Victim Services, housed within theDepartment of Public Safety, develop rules toadminister the per diem program for sheltersaround the state. Shelters are reimbursed for the costs to house women and their children on a per-person,per-day basis. The cost reimbursements werepreviously disbursed by the Department ofHuman Services based on a formula, but upontransfer to the Department of Public Safety inthe late 1990s, program reimbursements werecapped. As a result, the programs are anticipating a shortfall beginning in 2003. Funding to helpprevent the shortfall was included in the omni-bus transportation and public safety financelaw. The Center for Crime Victim Services dis- burses grants to various agencies statewidethat provide services for victims of crime. Manyof those agencies provide services to victims ofdomestic assault and abuse. Sen. Linda Berglin (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the measure in the Senate. HF1925/SF1369*/CH152 Offender recidivism study A new law effective Aug. 1, 2001, will require the commissioner of corrections to conduct astudy of electronic alcohol monitoring. Specifically, the study will compare recidi- vism and pre-trial, conditional release viola-tion rates among comparable drunken drivingoffenders who are subject to monitoring andthose offenders who are not. The analysis mustbe completed and reported to the chairs of theHouse and Senate committees having jurisdic-tion over this area by Feb. 15, 2002. Rep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-Falcon Heights), who sponsored the measure in theHouse, said that electronic alcohol monitoring18NEW LAWS2001Highlights saves money by precluding the need for prison sentences for certain offenders. \"These people are a danger to society only if they are drinking, \" she said. \"Hopefully, they will get some help. I want judges and courts touse (the electronic devices) more often. \" The study must incorporate several control variables, including: the offense level as deter-mined by the number of prior drunken drivingconvictions, date of offense, length of incar-ceration, and length of time an offender issubjected to electronic alcohol monitoring.The commissioner has discretion to includeadditional control variables in conducting thestudy. \"The study must also determine whether the impaired driving recidivism, if any, occurredduring or following the period of electronicalcohol monitoring, and whether it occurredpretrial or following conviction, \" the new law states. Electronic alcohol monitoring tools consist of a telephone based alcohol concentrationmeasuring device and an offender identifica-tion system. Law enforcement and probationofficials are able to determine if offenders areviolating conditions of parole or pre-trial release by remotely observing the results of on-the-spot alcohol-concentration checks.

The law was sponsored in the House by Rep. Doug Fuller (R-Bemidji). Existing law provides for certain minimum fines for any offense. Generally that amount is30 percent of the maximum fine. The maxi-mum fine for a misdemeanor is $1,000, and$3,000 for a gross misdemeanor. Maximumfines for felonious acts vary. Any fine may be reduced to $50 if a defen- dant qualifies for the services of a public de-fender, is otherwise indigent, or if the finecreates an undue hardship for the defendant ortheir family. Under the new law, that policy will be amended to allow judges to impose commu-nity service. The new law states that commu-nity service in lieu of a fine may be worked offat a rate of $5 per hour. Exceptions are permit-ted in cases of disabled or ill defendants. Previous law did allow sentences which al- lowed fines to be worked off. However, it didnot establish a standard for measuring howmuch of a fine had been worked off. Fuller saidsome poorer defendants were assigned lesswork because their fines were set lower than fordefendants capable of paying the full fine. Under the new law, all defendants will be required to work off or pay more equal fines.That consistent standard allows for a more fairsystem, Fuller said. Sen. Tony Kinkel (DFL-Park Rapids) spon- sored the Senate measure. HF865*/SF1266/CH71 Redefining child neglect A new law will amend the definition of child neglect by replacing three words with one. The law previously defined child neglect as the \"failure to protect a child from conditions or actions which imminently and seriouslyendanger the child 's physical or mental health. \" The new law replaces \"which imminently and \" with the word \"that. \"Rep. Debra Hilstrom (DFL-Brooklyn Center), who sponsored the law in the House,said she hoped counties would be able to inves-tigate complaints of child neglect sooner un-der the change. Hilstrom said her initial concern for the issue was prompted by a personal experiencein which her attempt to alert child protectionservices that a child was being \"tied up by mom \" during visitation was ignored. \"I was screened out, \" she said, in part because previ- ous law demanded that a child be imminentlyendangered. She added that, prior to the new law 's pas- sage, it was easier to remove a child from anabusive or neglectful home than to initiate aninvestigation. Sen. Leo Foley (DFL-Coon Rapids) spon- sored the law in the Senate. It is effectiveMay 22, 2001. HF1516/SF1583*/CH136 Additional protection for children Children living with people who have com- mitted child abuse in other states will be con-sidered in need of protection, under a new law. State law dictates that children need protec- tion if they reside, or will reside, with someoneguilty of child abuse. Prior to the measure, courts defined \"child abuse \" only by violations of existing Minnesota law. Beginning on Aug. 1, 2001, the definition will be expanded to include similar acts com-mitted in other jurisdictions, including otherstates, the District of Columbia, and triballands. Violations of federal law will also beincluded in this provision. Under the new law, a violation in another jurisdiction will be considered grounds for achild 's need for protection if the perpetrator 's act would have been a crime if it had beencommitted in Minnesota. Rep. Doug Fuller (R-Bemidji) and Sen. Tony Kinkel (DFL-Park Rapids) sponsored themeasure. HF953*/SF1265/CH73 Victims and expunging records A new law will give crime victims the oppor- tunity to comment on petitions by their assail-ants to expunge the criminal 's own records. Previous law allowed convicts to petition for the expungement of their records, meaningthat a record of a particular offense would be19Highlights NEW LAWS2001 sealed. Convicted criminals must petition the prosecutorial body holding jurisdiction overthe offense they wish expunged. Rep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-Falcon Heights) sponsored the law that will requirecriminals to include in their motions forexpungement the names and other pertinentinformation about any identifiable victims.Petitioning criminals must also include anyinformation regarding restraining orders pre-venting them from contacting victims, underthe new law. McGuire said she signed onto the bill to assist a victim who wished to influence a judge 's decision regarding an assailant 's motion to expunge a criminal record. \"I believe in victim notification, \" she said. Under the new law effective Aug. 1, 2001, the prosecutorial office must then serve by mailthe petition for expungement on any identifi-able victims. That service will specifically de-scribe the victim 's right to be present and submit a verbal or written statement at theexpungement hearing. Specifically, the new law allows victims to describe \"the harm suffered as a result of the crime and the victim 's recommendation on whether expungement should be granted ordenied. \" The judge will consider the victim 's statement when making a decision. Sen. Jane Ranum (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the bill in the Senate. HF372/SF229*/CH209 Officer protection A new law effective Aug. 1, 2001, will grant federal law enforcement officials the same au-thority to arrest people and protection fromdamage in Minnesota that officers from neigh-boring states currently exercise when aiding astate officer. Previously, officers from other states were granted the ability to arrest or detain people inMinnesota if several conditions were met,including: they must be on duty and be acting in response to a request made by a Minnesotapeace officer; they must act under the direction of the Minnesota personnel whom they assist andmust behave according to the regulations ofhis or her own jurisdiction; and they must surrender anyone arrested \"with- out unnecessary delay \" to a Minnesota peace officer.Supporters of the new law were concernedthat federal officials were not given the same status as out-of-state officers under Minnesotalaw. Officers from other states are guaranteedthe same protection regarding tort claims madeagainst the state as are Minnesota peace offic-ers. Under the new law such protection will beextended to federal peace officers renderingassistance in Minnesota. The new law specifically includes personnel from the Federal Bureau of Investigation; theU.S. Drug Enforcement Administration; theU.S. Marshal Service; the Secret Service; theBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms;and the U.S. Immigration and NaturalizationService. Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove) and Sen. Randy Kelly (DFL-St. Paul) sponsored the law. HF556*/SF756/CH16 Corrections changes A new law makes several changes to Depart- ment of Corrections guidelines, effectiveAug. 1, 2001. Among the most significant changes under the new law is a requirement that the depart-ment report annually to the Legislature severalpieces of information including: the amountspent per day to incarcerate adults, recidivismrates for all adult facilities, and the department 's mission, goals, and objectives. Some of these reporting requirements exist under existing law, but this law moves all re-porting requirements to one place. Per diem cost reductions were a primary focus of the department in its budget requestthis year. Legislators are interested in monitor-ing the progress of the program to reduce costsand the effect that process has on institutionsand employees. Furthermore, the department must com- plete a recidivism analysis of adult facilities,juvenile services, and community service pro-grams. The new law instructs the departmentto specifically examine educational programs,vocational activities, treatments, and indus-trial and educational services. Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester) sponsored the new law in the House and Sen. SatveerChaudhary (DFL-Fridley) sponsored it in theSenate. Another provision will create a peer review process for health care providers serving in-mates. Under the law, a committee must re-view and evaluate information relating to thequality of care and treatment provided to of-fenders and to contract with the commissionerof human services to conduct background stud-ies of individuals providing services in alljuvenile residential and detention facilities. Another provision of the new law amends existing statute governing criminal sexual con-duct to make sexual penetration of an inmateby a guard or other prison personnel qualify ascriminal sexual conduct in the third degree. Aconviction for this offense carries a maximum15-year sentence and up to a $30,000 fine. If there is no penetration, the crime is of the fourth degree, carrying a 10-year maximumsentence and a fine up to $20,000. Consent ofthe victim is not a defense in either case. The law allows records of court-ordered HIV tests to be kept in records maintained bythe Department of Corrections. Previously, nocourt records could include any record of thetest or its result. Another change requires the corrections commissioner to make continued reports onefforts to recruit a diverse workforce. HF1261*/SF1937/CH210 Public nuisance changes A 1923 law defined itinerant carnivals to be a public nuisance and prohibited them in thestate. A new law repeals that section of state law, effective Aug. 1, 2001. The statutes define an itinerant carnival as \"a promiscuous gathering of people, as specta- tors or otherwise, at which lewd or obscenefeatures are a part, or at which any gamblingconcessions are given or games of chance prac-ticed or in or about which actors or otherpersons connected therewith are engaged inimmoral pursuits, or at which attractions areexhibited which affect the health or morals ofthe community. \" The old law established a fine of not less than $50 but not more than $100 for those partici-pating in allowing or conducting an itinerantcarnival or imprisonment in a county jail orcity workhouse for between 30 days and threemonths. The repeal of the so-called obsolete law was one of several passed by lawmakers and signedby Gov. Jesse Ventura during the 2001 session. Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville) and Sen. Randy Kelly (DFL-St. Paul) were the sponsors.

The new law, which includes more than $365 million in spending from the state 's gen- eral fund, contains language regarding amerger of the Department of Economic Secu-rity into the Department of Trade and Eco-nomic Development, and several one-timefunding initiatives designed to address devel-opment and housing issues. Gov. Jesse Ventura line-item vetoed about $1.3 million from the bill in local projects (seerelated story, p. 89). Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville) and Sen. Ellen Anderson (DFL-St. Paul) sponsored theomnibus legislation that is effective July 1, 2001 unless otherwise noted. Below are some highlights of the measure.2001 Special Session: HF5*/SF12/CH4 Workforce development About $21.3 million over the biennium was appropriated for workforce developmentinitiatives. The state 's dislocated workers program is continued, but reorganized, under the mea-sure. The administration 's original budget rec- ommendations would have eliminated statefunding while maintaining the program onfederal funds only. Minnesota is one of 13states to supplement federal funds with statemoney. First implemented in 1991, the state pro- gram provides development services to unem-ployed workers who struggle to find employ-ment as a result of plant closures, mass layoffs,skills that are no longer current with the mar-ketplace needs, and technology changes. The new law allows the Job Skills Partner- ship Board to make grants to workforce serviceareas and other eligible organizations to pro-vide services to dislocated workers. Funds granted by the board may be used for employment transition services such as jobtraining, job search and placement assistance,skills and aptitude assessments, and careercounseling. The grants can also be used for services that allow the participant to become re-employedby retraining for a new occupation or industry,enhancing current skills and providing entrepreneurial training. Other support ser-vices such as family care assistance, commut-ing assistance, and housing and rental assis-tance may also be offered by the grantees. The new law also requires the board to work with representatives of local workforce coun-cils and local elected officials to establish per-formance standards for the programs and ac-tivities funded by the measure. McElroy said in recent years there have been waiting lists of people needing assistance atseveral of the state 's workforce councils and the new law allows the state 's Jobs Skills Part- nership Board greater flexibility in shiftingfunds to meet the needs of dislocated workers.(Art. 2, Sec. 7) Agencies merged The law incorporates the Ventura administration 's proposal to consolidate workforce-related programs and to abolish theDepartment of Economic Security. Thatdepartment 's program functions and employ- ees will be merged into other agencies andboards, under the measure. A workforce development program reorga- nization transition advisory team will be cre-ated to make recommendations to the gover-nor and the Legislature by Dec. 1, 2001. Thegoal is to streamline and consolidate the state 's workforce system to provide more efficientand effective workforce developmentprograms. Many of the Department of Economic Secu- rity services will be transferred to the Depart-ment of Trade and Economic Development, Additional funds were allocated to the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency by the 2001 Legislature, whichcould be used for homeless programs in the state, some of which will aid shelters.PHOTO BY ANDREW VON BANK21Highlights NEW LAWS2001 such as the workforce services unit for employment transition services, youth services,welfare-to-work services, and workforceexchange services. The transition team will consist of 12 mem- bers including six members appointed by thegovernor. That group must contain one mem-ber representing business, one representinglabor, and one representing job providers. TheHouse and Senate will also each appoint threemembers to serve on the team. The law specifies that the transition team must solicit input from all interested groupson how to best implement the reorganization.The team is required to consider alternativeconfigurations of existing programs. It also requires that no employee in the classified service should suffer a job loss, orhave salary or benefits reduced as a result of thereorganization. McElroy said it would be up to the reorgani- zation team to determine the name of the newdepartment. The original bills that passed theHouse and Senate would have named the de-partment the Department of Economic andWorkforce Development but McElroy saidthere were concerns that the acronym \"DEWD \" was inappropriate. (Art. 3, Sec. 1-7) Housing help In other appropriations, the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency will receive$129 million during the biennium to fund itsprograms. The appropriation includes The Minnesota Housing Finance Agency will receive a $44 million appropriation for the agency 's affordable rental investment fund, during 2002-03 under the omnibus jobs and economic development funding law.The funding is used to finance the acquisition, rehabilitation, and debt restructuring of federally assistedrental property and for making equity loans.PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID appropriation not added to the agency 's base budget. The funding is used to finance theacquisition, rehabilitation, and debt restruc-turing of federally assisted rental property andfor making equity loans. The fund is also usedby the agency to finance permanent and sup-portive rental housing units. (Art. 1, Sec. 5) In another effort to stimulate the construc- tion and availability of affordable housing inthe state, a $24 million appropriation is pro-vided for the agency 's economic development and housing challenge program. That program provides grants or loans to support economic development activities orjob creation within a community or region bymeeting locally identified housing needs. The new law provides that if a grant or loan is used for the demolition or removal of exist-ing structures, the cleared land must be usedfor the construction of housing to be owned orrented by people who meet the income limitsof the program, or for housing-related pur-poses that benefit adjacent residents. Further, the agency is required to review the potential displacement of residents and con-sider the extent to which displacement of resi-dents is minimized in making in reviewing thegrant or loan proposals. (Art. 5, Sec. 5)The omnibus jobs and economic development funding law directs the commissioner of economic securityto require general employment and training programs receiving state funds to make available informationrelating to opportunities for women in nontraditional careers in the trades and technical occupations.PHOTO BY ANDREW VON BANK $24 million for transfer of federal TemporaryAssistance to Needy Families (TANF) funds tothe Department of Revenue for the WorkingFamily Tax Credit program.

The House Jobs and Economic Develop- ment Finance Committee heard testimony thata national study found about one-half of peoplesurveyed thought they could contract HIVfrom a sneeze, cough, or touch from a personwith the virus. HIV is the virus that can developinto AIDS. (Art. 1, Sec. 4) Another one-time appropriation to the de- partment provides $35,000 for a report on thecosts and benefits of employers providing paidparental leave. The Senate had proposed creat-ing a voluntary parental leave program thatwould have reimbursed employers that pro-vided a paid leave of absence in conjunctionwith a birth or adoption of a child. However, working group members could not reach agreement on the provision so theissue will be studied further. (Art. 1, Sec. 5) Organ donation The new law will provide 40 hours of paid leave to public employees who donate organs.The measure allows employers to require veri-fication by a physician of the purpose andlength of each leave requested by the employeefor organ donation. The law requires the Department of Em- ployee Relations to prepare a report to theLegislature by Feb. 15, 2003 analyzing the costsof the paid leaves of absence. The provisionwill expire on June 30, 2004. The Senate had originally proposed allow- ing a 30-day leave of absence for employeeswho donate organs. However, House mem-bers of the omnibus bill 's working group ex- pressed concern that that amount of time mightprovide too much of a burden on smallemployers. (Art. 2, Sec. 9) Equity investment tool A state capital access program that pro- motes and assists in economic development isbeing expanded to make equity investmentsavailable to community organizations, under anew law effective Aug. 1, 2001. The legislation was initiated by the state Department of Trade and Economic Develop-ment, which wanted to make funding availablefor community development in the form ofequity investments (stocks or bonds) or loansfor other assistance under the capital access program. A \"community development venture capi- tal fund \" is defined in the law as a \"regional or local venture capital fund that makes equityinvestments in small or emerging companiesand has a financial as well as a social mission. \" Venture capitalists are usually a group of investors that offer money to invest in new orexpanding companies. They may also be will-ing to invest in a struggling business in order tokeep it from failing. Typically, the businessapproaches the venture capitalist with a pro-posal that the investors accept or reject. The commissioner of the department has new responsibilities with the additional fund,under the new law. Those duties include mar-keting the program to businesses and venturecapital funds and entering into contracts andagreements with those funds. The commis-sioner is also permitted to invest funds fromthe state 's capital access account to make eq- uity investments in venture capital funds. Under the law, the capital access program is exempted from a general five-year limit oncontracts provided in previous law. Rep. Tony Sertich (DFL-Chisholm) and Sen. James Metzen (DFL-South St. Paul) sponsoredthe law. HF1940/SF1472*/CH153 Job program changes Gov. Jesse Ventura signed a new law May 25 that modifies language pertaining to the JobSkills Partnership Program and the PathwaysProgram. Language in previous law for the Job Skills Partnership Program referred to serving \"dis- placed workers. \" The new law removes the word \"displaced \" so state law only refers to \"workers. \" In previous statute, the Pathways Program assisted in the \"transition of persons from welfare to work. \" The law changes the law to also assist \"individuals who are at or below 200 percent of federal poverty guidelines. \" Also under the Pathways Program, the new law deletes specifications that programs re-ceiving aid must \"serve public assistance re- cipients transitioning from welfare to work, \" and adds that aid recipients may be \"services supporting education and training programsthat serve eligible recipients. \" Prior language required employers who re- ceive funding through the HIRE EducationLoan Program to have used it to obtain themost \"cost-effective \" training. This sectionchanges the statement to refer to the most \"effective \" training. Participants in the programs and adminis- trators testified during the session that the lawsgoverning the programs were too restrictiveand made certain people ineligible though theyhad established their participation would bevaluable under the original intent of theprograms. For example, the cost-effective requirement eliminated participants who received a clearbenefit but didn 't necessarily meet the cost- effective guidelines. The law, effective Aug. 1, 2001, is sponsored by Rep. Bob Gunther (R-Fairmont) in theHouse and Sen. Dave Johnson (DFL-Bloomington) in the Senate. HF1941*/SF1899/CH181 HRA changes During the 2000 session, the Legislature passed a law changing the threshold amountson which municipal contracts were required togo through a formal bid process. Effective Aug. 1, 2001, a new law will change the threshold amount for housing and redevel-opment authorities (HRAs) to parallel thechanges from the previous year. HRAs are public bodies created by cities, counties, or on a multi-jurisdictional level, toprovide a sufficient supply of adequate, safe,and sanitary dwellings and to remedy the short-age of housing for low- and moderate-incomeresidents in addition to redeveloping blightedareas. The new law will increase the threshold for awarding contracts for construction work andrelated equipment from $25,000 to $35,000 foran authority whose area of operation has apopulation of less than 2,500. For those abovethat population level the threshold is $50,000. HRAs may now make emergency purchases exceeding $50,000, but not more than $75,000,with a four-fifths vote without requiring bids.Previously, HRAs could make emergency pur-chases up to $50,000 without receiving bids. Finally, the new law increases the limit from $25,000 to $50,000 for projects on which anHRA may accept a certified check or cashier 's check in lieu of a performance bond. Rep. Larry Howes (R-Walker) and Sen. Martha Robertson (R-Minnetonka) sponsoredthe measure. HF1589/SF1301*/CH14023Highlights NEW LAWS2001 Investment fund latitude Recipients of grants from the Minnesota Investment Fund will have more control overthe money they receive, under a new law effec-tive Aug. 1, 2001. Sponsored by Rep. Bob Gunther (R-Fairmont) and Sen. Dennis Frederickson(R-New Ulm), the new law will give morelatitude to cities or counties that receive repay-ment of funds awarded as loans or grants fromthe investment fund. Under the law, the entities would be able to contribute the money to larger projects, com-munity capital funds, or a statewide revolvingloan fund. The legislation adds new languageto allow the projects to be statewide and notmerely regional. The law has no direct fiscal impact to the state.HF1392/SF1258*/CH102 Rental application fee study (See Housing, page 51) Dismissed projects (See Vetoed Bills, page 89) EDUCATION# K-12 funding law Minnesota 's public schools will receive nearly $8.76 billion in funding during the 2002-03biennium, under the omnibus K-12 fundinglaw. The number represents an 8 percent in-crease over spending in the previous two years. The package approved by the House and Senate, and signed by Gov. Jesse Ventura with-out any vetoes, alters the way schools negotiateteacher contracts, helps less wealthy districtswith funding, affects school regulation of medi-cations for some students, and adds more over-sight of charter schools. Here are some of the highlights of the legis- lation sponsored by Rep. Alice Seagren (R-Bloomington) and Sen. LeRoy Stumpf (DFL-Thief River Falls). Items are effectiveJuly 1, 2001, unless otherwise noted. 2001 Special Session: HF2*/SF6/CH6 General education revenue Most of the $393 million in new money for the biennium will go to schools to increase theper-pupil funding formula, by about 2.6 per-cent in each of the next two years. The approxi-mately $290 million is nearly three times whatVentura recommended in January. The legislation calls for a $104 annual in- crease per pupil from $3,964 to $4,068 in fiscal School district employee contracts, including those with teachers, must now be structurally balanced,under the 2001 K-12 education funding law passed by the Legislature. School boards must determine bya resolution that an agreement will not exceed available district funds during the life of the agreement.PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID year 2002. The dollars will increase by the sameamount for 2003. (Art. 1, Sec. 16) In both years there is no change for pupil weighting or for declining pupil counts.Furthermore, compensatory revenues, which generally aid low-income districts, willrise as they are tied to the general formula. Provisions in the omnibus tax law aid less24NEW LAWS2001Highlights wealthy districts with an in- crease in the general-educa-tion funding formula begin-ning in fiscal year 2003. Underthe plan, districts whose vot-ers fail to approve excess levieswill receive up to an additional$415 per pupil. Thirty-sevendistricts now have no excesstaxes. Districts that have an excess levy, but not at the $415 level,will receive the difference be-tween their voter-approvedlevel and the $415 districts getfrom the state in the generaleducation formula. Proponents say this is crucial for poorer districts that havestruggled to pass such levies,especially in Greater Minnesota. Spending rules The law features numerous new provisions regarding how districts areallowed to spend dollars, and the reporting ofsuch. Class size revenue must now be used to reduce class sizes in kindergarten through thirdgrade, with a target ratio of 17 students perteacher. (Art. 1, Sec. 24) A report regarding class size for students in kindergarten through sixth grade, district-wideand at individual schools, must be made publicby a district by Dec. 1 of each year. The reportmust also make available the amount of rev-enue the district received and how it was used.(Art. 1, Sec. 26) In order to provide additional revenue for an optional all-day kindergarten program, districtsare allowed to reallocate general education rev-enue attributable to high school seniors choos-ing to graduate early. (Art. 1, Sec. 27) Previous law required districts receiving basic skills revenue to report the expenditures it in-curred to meet the needs of students. The newlaw requires that the report must also determinewhether increased expenditures raised studentachievement levels. (Art. 1, Sec. 30) An independent school evaluation service will be contracted to evaluate and report on theacademic and financial performance of allschool districts in areas such as: expenditures,the extent to which student outcomes improvecommensurate with spending increases, schooldistrict financial health, and school districtdebt and capital spending levels. The reportmust be completed within 360 days and thenmade available to officials, educators and thepublic so they can, among other things, easily compare districts. The law sets aside$2.5 million in 2002 for this. (Art. 2, Sec. 64) When a school board authorizes or permits violations of state law they may now have stateaid withheld. Previously, it was mandatory towithhold the money. This is also true whenfunds are used contrary to their statutory pur-pose. Additional dispute hearing requirementsare also included in the new law. (Art. 5, Sec. 5) Integration aid As for integration aid, the law equalizes the formula between Minneapolis and St. Paulbeginning in 2003 in hopes of reducing dispar-ity. Lawmakers said the districts are similar asurban districts and in the percentage of minor-ity populations. The new law also authorizes integration rev- enue for a district that files a plan with thecommissioner of the Department of Children,Families and Learning, where enrollment ofprotected students in the district exceeds15 percent, or for a member district of a multi-district integration collaborative that files aplan, but is not contiguous to a racially isolateddistrict. (Art. 2, Sec. 47) Structural balance, employee pay Another key component of the new law is that district employee contracts, includingteachers, must now be structurally balanced. The legislation instructs school boards that they must determine by a board resolution thatan agreement will not cause structuralimbalance, insomuch as expenses will not ex- ceed available funds during the life of the agree-ment. In addition, the school board must project revenues, expenditures, and fund balances forone year past the agreement. All projections and calculations must be made available to the public prior to and at the meetingwhere the resolution is adopted. (Art. 2, Sec. 61) The law also contains $8 million for a pilot project to reformulate how teachers are paid.The goal is to base pay on performance. The incentive moves the teacher pay system from the \"steps and lanes \" used to set teachers ' pay and instead rewards them for what theybring to the classroom and how students per-form. \"Steps \" refers to the number of years a person has taught, and \"lanes \" refers to the degrees a person has earned. If a district wants to convert its entire pay structure, it will receive an additional $150 perpupil to do so. (Art. 2, Secs. 54, 55) Teacher training The Center for Excellence in Urban Teach- ing, a 20-credit series of classes at HamlineUniversity, aims to increase the number ofnew minority teachers and help teachers of anybackground succeed in urban or urban-likeclassrooms. Two other programs at ConcordiaUniversity in St. Paul and the University ofSt. Thomas have similar missions.

(Art. 2, Sec. 2) Cost clarification, study The law also features a number of new stud- ies aimed at reducing operating costs. One study will examine the state 's whole funding structure in hopes of simplifying itand making it easier to understand. In propos-ing the legislation, lawmakers said the fundingstructure seemingly gets more complicatedevery session. (Art. 1, Sec. 48) Another provision relating to transportation calls for the commissioner of the Department ofChildren, Families and Learning to examinetransportation costs for 13 ridership categories,including regular, disabled, late activity, andenrollment options. The report is to look atfunding inequities, determine if public trans-portation options can be used more effectively,and make recommendations to provide equi-table transportation funding. (Art. 1, Sec. 51) Policy provisions Besides setting funding for fiscal years 2002 and 2003, the legislation establishes severalnew policies. The law directs the commissioner of chil- dren, families and learning to develop andimplement a system for measuring and report-ing students ' academic achievement and indi- vidual student progress, consistent with thestatewide educational accountability and re-porting system. It requires system components to measure the adequate yearly progress of schools andindividual students, and to include statewidemeasures of student academic achievementthat identify schools with high levels of achieve-ment and schools with low levels of achieve-ment that need improvement. Schools failing to meet adequate progress for two consecutive years must develop con-tinuous improvement plans for meeting stateand local expectations for studentachievement. (Art. 2, Sec. 5) The eligibility criteria allowing districts to participate in the alternative facilities bondingand levy program has been expanded. Districtshaving more than 1.5 million square feet ofspace and with an average age of the buildingspace of at least 35 years qualify beginning in fiscal year 2004. (Art. 4, Sec. 6) Under the law, a state board of administra- tion is created with $165,000 each year, givingadministrators oversight over their own peers,much like the Board of Teaching does withK-12 instructors. (Art. 7, Sec. 6) School principals now have the authority, in addition to teachers, to use reasonable forcewhen necessary to discipline a student. Thenew law creates a defense against civil liabilityand criminal prosecution. (Art. 2, Sec. 6) Non-licensed community experts employed by a district or charter school must have crimi-nal background checks completed and the lo-cal district must report that information to thestate Board of Teaching. (Art. 2, Sec. 9) Student achievement tests The law requires seventh graders to join third, fifth, and eighth graders in taking thestate basic skills tests beginning in the 2002-03school year. Officials must develop a process toallow students to take the basic skills test asearly as fifth grade. In addition, students mustbe able to perform computational skills on thebasic skills math test without a calculator be-ginning Feb. 1, 2002. Parents will also now have access to their student 's exam and answer sheet. The measure addresses concerns that some tests were markedwrong and students thought they failed whenthey had passed. (Art. 2, Secs. 4, 67-69) Charter schools Charter schools are now specifically included in the list of schools that require criminalbackground checks for teachers and otherschool staff. (Art. 2, Sec. 18) The legislation features new conflict of in- terest laws that prohibit people employed by afor-profit entity with whom the school con-tracts from serving on a school 's board of directors. Nonprofit employees may joinboards provided they disclose any conflicts tothe Department of Children, Families andLearning. (Art. 2, Sec. 20) In terms of forming a charter school, the new law allows the commissioner to elect to sponsora school or to assist the applicant in finding aneligible sponsor. It also allows a school district toform a corporation for the purpose of creating acharter school. (Art. 2, Sec. 21) Additionally the law creates a statewide char- ter school advisory council to, among otherthings, encourage school boards to make fulluse of charter school opportunities, provideleadership and support for charter school spon-sors to improve schools, and promote timelyfinancial management training. The council expires June 30, 2003. (Art. 2, Secs. 26, 66) Furthermore, the law directs the commis- sioner to review and approve or deny a leaseaid application based on four criteria. It alsoprohibits a charter school from using lease aidfor custodial, maintenance, or other operatingcosts. (Art. 2, Sec. 27) The law predicates a charter school 's state aid payments during its first three years ontimely quarterly filings of enrollment counts.(Art. 2, Sec. 28) The Minnesota State High School League must prepare a report for the Legislature byFeb. 15, 2002, that indicates the interest ofcharter school students in participating in ath-letic activities available in the students ' resi- dent district. The league must cover the cost ofthe report. (Art. 2, Sec. 73) Regulating Ritalin The new law also affects school regulation of students ' sympathomimetic medications. Sym- pathomimetic medications, such as Ritalin,are often used to treat a child diagnosed withattention deficit disorder (ADD) or attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Legis-lation sponsored by Rep. Barb Sykora (R-Exclesior) earlier in the session included manyof the provisions passed into this new law. Legislators and officials are questioning the prac-tice of prescribing Ritalin for school children, say-ing that attention deficit and hyperactivitydisorders may be overdiagnosed and parents arecoerced into giving the drug unnecessarily. A newlaw authorized a study of Ritalin prescriptionsamong school age children.PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID26NEW LAWS2001Highlights School administrators will be restricted from requiring a parent to provide sympathomi-metic medication to their child before read-mitting them to school after being suspended.A parent, after consulting with health care,education, or other professional providers, willnow be allowed to decide whether their childshould receive sympathomimetic medication.In addition, a parent 's refusal to provide their child with such medication does not constituteeducational neglect. Additionally, $50,000 is set aside for a study on the use of such medications. The reportmust include the number and overall inci-dence rate of Minnesota children ages 3 to 18by age, gender and race diagnosed with ADDor ADHD currently taking medications suchas Ritalin. It must also look at the number and inci- dence rate of children not identified with ADDor ADHD currently taking sympathomimeticmedications.

(Art. 2, Secs. 51, 52) Congress' special education promise The Legislature and Gov. Jesse Ventura have forwarded a resolution urging Congress tofulfill its promise to fund 40 percent of specialeducation costs. The resolution has now officially be sent to both the U.S. House of Representatives andSenate. Sponsors said the lack of funding hurts Minnesota 's education system by obligating the state to subsidize K-12 special educationcosts resulting from federal requirements. Federal allocations for special education funding have averaged 13 percent annually forthe past several years. The resolution reads: \"Over 25 years ago, the federal government required states to providechildren with disabilities an appropriate edu-cation, and for 25 years, the government hasfailed to meet its promise to pay 40 percent ofthe cost. \" Rep. Lyndon Carlson (DFL-Crystal) and Sen. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope) sponsored theofficial version that passed both houses andbecame law. Rep. Andrew Westerberg (R-Blaine), also sponsored a similar measure, ini-tially approved by House committees but ulti-mately set aside for the Senate version. HF670/SF647*/R2Asthma inhalers allowed Elementary and secondary school students with asthma will be allowed to carry theirinhalers in school, under a new law effectiveAug. 1, 2001. The law was sponsored in the House by Rep. Kathy Tingelstad (R-Andover). Tingelstad explained that students some- times need inhalers before they can reach thenurse 's office, where some schools require in- halers be kept. About 43 percent of schools inMinnesota have this requirement, she said. In order to carry and use the inhalers in school, students must have written parentalpermission that is renewed annually. The newlaw also requires the school nurse or otherauthorized party to \"assess the student 's knowl- edge and skills to safely possess and use anasthma inhaler in a school setting. \" Noting that asthma is the number one cause for missed school days, Tinglestad said thelegislation would help students control asthmabetter. Tinglestad said she was contacted by the American Lung Association about the legisla-tion. The association worked with the Minne-sota Nurses Association and the School NursesAssociation to draft legislation similar to thatin several other states. The Senate version was sponsored by Sen. Charles Wiger (DFL-North St. Paul), who per-sonally has asthma. HF1394/SF1706*/CH84 Class dismissal and removal Grounds for which students can be dis- missed or removed from class will be adjusted,under a new law effective Aug. 1, 2001. The new law states that a student who \"sig- nificantly \" \u2014 instead of \"materially and sub- stantially, \" as in previous law \u2014 disrupts the rights of others to an education could be dis-missed or removed from class. The new law adds \"willful conduct that sig- nificantly disrupts ... the ability of school per- sonnel to perform their duties, or school-spon-sored extracurricular activities \" as a ground for dismissal. In addition, the law clarifies thatany willful conduct of students that endangersschool district employees, as well as the pupil,other pupils, or surrounding people may callfor dismissal. The law expands grounds for removal from class to \"...conduct that interferes with a teacher 's ability to teach or communicate ef- fectively with students in a class or with theability of other students to learn, \" or that27Highlights NEW LAWS2001 endangers surrounding persons, including school district employees. Also, a new provision requires school dis- tricts to try to meet with the parent of a studentwho has been removed from school for 10cumulative days in a school year. The purposeof the meeting is \"to attempt to determine the pupil 's need for assessment or other services. \" Teachers and administrators who were con- cerned about the dismissal of disruptive stu-dents felt \"the evidentiary standard is too high to remove a student who is disrupting therights of other kids to learn, \" said House spon- sor, Rep. Jeff Johnson (R-Plymouth). \"This (law) just lowers the standard somewhat. \" Sen. Thomas Neuville (R-Northfield) was the Senate sponsor. HF2107*/SF1329/CH183 Drug paraphernalia notification In addition to drugs and alcohol, law en- forcement will now have to report to schooldistricts when a student is found in possessionof drug paraphernalia, under a new law effec-tive Aug. 1, 2001. \"It is a strong indication that they may be having problems with drugs, \" said the law 's House sponsor, Rep. James Clark (R-NewUlm), of an instance where a student is pos-sessing drug paraphernalia. The Minnesota Under a new law, law enforcement agencies mustnotify the appropriate school staff when the agencyhas probable cause to believe that the student isusing or possessing drug paraphernalia.PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID License deadline moved up The deadline for submitting applications for temporary teaching licenses was changedfrom Aug. 1 to July 1, under a new law. Rep. Jim Abeler (R-Anoka) sponsored the law in the House. It is effective for the 2001-02school year and beyond. The earlier date gives the state Board of Teaching, which reviews the applications, ad-ditional time to complete its work before theschool year begins. It also provides the Depart-ment of Children, Families and Learning addi-tional time to process the licenses. The new date also applies to the date by which the Board of Teaching may accept appli-cations for personnel variances. Furthermore,the law instructs the board to amend its rules toconform with the July 1 date. Sen. Leo Foley (DFL-Coon Rapids) spon- sored the law in the Senate. HF1192*/SF1979/CH68 Teacher certification variance Teacher candidates who enrolled in a teacher preparation program by Jan. 1, 2000 will be ableto graduate under former teacher certificationrules under a new law effective Jan. 17, 2001. The new law, sponsored in the House by Rep. Marty Seifert (R-Marshall), allows stu-dents who are close to completing their teach-ing degrees to save time and money by nothaving to enroll in additional courses. Accord-ing to the law, qualifying students must beenrolled in an accredited teacher preparationprogram.Seifert said the Legislature had directed the Minnesota Board of Teaching to revise teacherlicensure requirements in Minnesota, but thenew requirements did not permit certain cur-rently enrolled students to be grandfathered inunder old rules. Students who qualify to graduate under the former requirements may have attended schoolpart-time or have taken time off, Seifert said.Eligible students must apply for licensure un-der the old rules by Sept. 1, 2003.

Previous law required the law enforcement agency to report in writing to a school district 's chemical abuse pre-assessment team any stu-dent incident dealing with drugs and alcohol.The student 's parents would also be notified of any such incident. The new law applies thesame reporting guidelines to incidents of pos-sessing drug paraphernalia. The pre-assessment team is responsible for addressing reports of students ' chemical abuse problems and making recommendations forappropriate responses, according to the non-partisan House Research department.

HF1046/SF991*/CH1828NEW LAWS2001Highlights ELECTIONS# Type in political advertisements Paid political advertisements must not only contain a disclaimer stating who produced thematerial, but the disclaimer must be legible,under a new law effective Aug. 1, 2001. As it was originally introduced, the law would have required political disclaimers be at least10-point type. But during discussion of thelaw, many members suggested that both fontsize and style were important. Even in 10-pointtype, some fonts are difficult to read. The new law requires that the disclaimers \"must be in a legible text size and font.\" Rep. Marty Seifert (R-Marshall), House sponsor of the law, said many people in hiscommunity were upset with an advertisementthat appeared in the local newspaper, theMarshall Independent , near election time. Be- cause the disclaimer was difficult to read, it wasnearly impossible for voters to know who wasresponsible for producing the advertisement. Seifert said it was \"common sense\" that since the state requires the disclaimers, thatpeople be able to read them. Sen. Arlene Lesewski (R-Marshall) was the Senate sponsor.

Effective Aug. 1, 2001, the law will require national background checks of individuals ifthey have lived in Minnesota for less than 10years. Previous law only required nationalchecks if a person lived in Minnesota less thanfive years. Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley) and Sen. Dave Knutson (R-Burnsville) sponsoredthe measure. Leppik had sponsored a similarbill during the regular session, but a provisionthat would reduce liability for former employ-ers to give out employment information wasamended to the bill on the House floor. AHouse-Senate conference committee was notable to reach an agreement on that portion ofthe bill. Leppik said the measure is important for the owners of apartment buildings to know abouttheir managers' backgrounds for resident safety. Rep. Jim Knoblach (R-St. Cloud), who pro- posed attaching the employee reference lan-guage to Leppik's original bill, said he sup-ported the measure and did not want his pro-vision to derail what was otherwise a good bill. \"I think this bill is one small step to eliminat- ing the problem,\" said Rep. Luanne Koskinen(DFL-Coon Rapids), whose daughter's mur-der helped lead to the original law requiringmanager background checks. (The chief sus-pect in the 1994 murder of Kari Koskinen washer apartment manager, and he had been pre-viously convicted of three sex offenses. Hecommitted suicide before charges could befiled.) 2001 Special Session HF26/SF18*/CH7 Clarifying unemployment laws Effective Aug. 1, 2001, a new law clarifies several provisions of state law governing un-employment benefits. The new law deals primarily with technical changes. However, a few significant adjust-ments will allow some applicants to obtainbenefits more quickly, while others make statelaw adhere to federal law that requires Ameri-can Indian tribes to be treated similarly topublic employers in Minnesota. Specifically, the law allows public employers to switch between paying unemployment taxesand reimbursing the system directly. In addi- tion, a provision that automatically makes apublic employer a reimbursing entity, unless itspecifically elects to pay unemployment taxes,is effective May 26, 2001. Under the new law, American Indian tribes have the same flexibility, effective retroactivelyto Dec. 31, 2000. Also effective May 26, 2001, the law allows some unemployed people to backdate theirapplications for unemployment benefits insome situations. For example, many peopledon't apply for benefits until one week afterthey become unemployed. Because the unem-ployment requires applicants to wait a weekbefore receiving benefits, that creates a two-week lag. The new law allows some applicants to back- date their applications to the date they becameunemployed, thereby allowing those individu-als to receive necessary benefits one week earlier. Another provision will allow someone to receive unemployment benefits if he or shequits because of domestic abuse. Previous lawdisqualified such people from receiving unem-ployment benefits because they had techni-cally quit. Under the new law, the Department of Eco- nomic Security, which administers unemploy-ment benefits, can deny benefits to people whodo not provide all of the required informationin their applications. Each year, a task force, comprised of profes- sionals representing labor, industry, consumerissues, and the state, reviews recommendedchanges to unemployment insurance laws. TheDepartment of Economic Security compilesthose initiatives into one bill. This new lawresults from those efforts. Rep. Ken Wolf (R-Burnsville) and Sen. Den- nis Frederickson (R-New Ulm) sponsored thelaw. HF655*/SF1277/CH175 Workers' compensation changes Laws pertaining to workers' compensation will receive minor changes, under a new lawpassed by the 2001 Legislature. Effective Aug. 1, 2001, the new law is spon- sored by Rep. Bud Nornes (R-Fergus Falls) andSen. Arlene Lesewski (R-Marshall). The law primarily makes technical changes to workers' compensation statutes. Amongthose changes, a registered nurse will be addedto the Medical Services Review Board. Also, inorder for employers to be reimbursed from thespecial compensation fund for workers'29Highlights NEW LAWS2001 compensation expenses, they must be current with their records and with their workers ' com- pensation reporting and payment obligations. In addition, independent contractors will no longer need an employer identificationnumber from the Internal Revenue Service toqualify for workers ' compensation. Instead, these contractors can qualify by having filedbusiness or self-employment tax returns in theprevious year. HF2225/SF2046*/CH123 Wages payment protection Employers will be prohibited from altering the method in which they issue payments ofwages to employees who have left their com-pany, under a new law signed by Gov. JesseVentura. Brought to the Legislature by the state Department of Labor and Industry, the lawaddresses a complaint the department had re-ceived. The new law will protect employeeswho have quit or been terminated and haveearned commissions that have not yet beenpaid. Employers, be they people, firms, corpo-rations, or associations, \"may not alter the method of payment, timing of payment, orprocedures for payment of commissions earned... if the result is to delay or reduce the amount of payment, \" the law states. The law will also provide for civil action against the employer, who would be liable fortwice the amount in dispute. Effective Aug. 1, 2001, the law is sponsored in the House by Rep. Tony Sertich (DFL-Chisholm) and in the Senate by Sen. LindaHiggins (DFL-Mpls). HF1893/SF1344*/CH199 Genetic testing prohibited A new law will prohibit employers from requesting, requiring, or administering genetictesting from its workers. The legislation is aimed at preventing em- ployers from terminating or demoting, hiringor promoting workers based on genetic testingthat may reveal abnormalities or deficienciesin a person 's genes. Employers would also be restricted from affecting terms of employmentby using genetic information that a worker hasvoluntarily submitted. The new law allows employees to sue em- ployers who violate the law. The court mayaward \"up to three times the actual damages suffered due to the violation; (and) punitivedamages, \" the law states.The law was prompted by a 2001 case against the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad,which was sued for ordering employees to takeblood tests that would determine whether agenetic cause of carpal tunnel syndrome ex-isted. The railroad has suspended the tests, butlawsuits are still pending. The law, sponsored by Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) and Sen. Ellen Anderson (DFL-St. Paul), is effective Aug. 1, 2001. HF1886/SF1721*/CH154 Alternate forms of identification Beginning Aug. 1, 2001, minors will have a new option for showing proof of age for pro-spective employers. Prior to the new law, minors could only submit a copy of their birth certificate, driver 's license, or an age certification, which can beissued by a school superintendent. Now, an Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) Employment Eligibility FormI-9 is also acceptable for proof of age. \"Since the I-9 is required anyway and allows more flexibility, it was a logical change to allowit for an additional verification option, \" said Rep. Carl Jacobson (R-Vadnais Heights), theHouse sponsor of the law. The I-9 form also does not require the em- ployer to keep copies of the documents, therebykeeping sensitive information out of person-nel files. Jacobson said the city of Shoreview, which approached him about the legislation, hiresmany minors for summer employment. \"Getting the needed documentation often delayed the start dates for youth, \" he said. Since many youth do not yet drive, he said, a driver 's license may not exist; birth certifi- cates contain a great deal of personal informa-tion, such as race and parents ' marital status; and often an age certification is difficult toobtain from the school superintendent, giventhe timing of the city 's jobs. Sen. Mady Reiter (R-Shoreview) sponsored the law in the Senate. HF1409/SF1090*/CH82 Termination requests Employees and employers dealing with ter- mination will have a longer period of time torequest and provide the reason for the termi-nation, under a new law effective Aug. 1, 2001. Prior to the measure, state law provided that employees who have been involuntarily termi-nated had five working days beyond the date oftermination to request in writing the reason for the termination. Upon receipt of the re-quest, the employer then had five working daysto provide a written response. The time for employees to submit the re- quest will now be extended to 15 working days,and employers will now have 10 working daysto fulfill the request. Rep. Jim Rhodes (R-St. Louis Park), House sponsor of the law, said a constituent of hisapproached him about extending the time.When someone is terminated, he said, theywere sometimes \"in such shock \" that by the time they wanted a letter, the request periodhad already lapsed. \"This is to make it easier for the person that was terminated, \" he said. Sen. Steve Kelley (DFL-Hopkins) sponsored the measure in the Senate. HF1920/SF1835*/CH95 Employee assistance records Under a new law, employee assistance records will be accessible to the employee andheld confidentially. Employee assistance records are those docu- ments created when employees or their fami-lies are provided with counseling, assessment,or similar services paid for by an employer inorder to help employees address personal is-sues that may be creating productivity issues atwork, according to nonpartisan House Re-search staff. The legislation was introduced after an indi- vidual, whose case was handled by the stateAttorney General 's Office, was denied access to her own records, said Rep. Tony Sertich(DFL-Chisholm), House sponsor of the law. Effective Aug. 1, 2001, employees will have access to their own employee assistance records,and those of their children, if they are stillminors. The records must be provided at nocost within seven working days of the requestif the records are in the state, or 14 days if therecords are out of the state. Employee assistance records must also be kept separate from an employee 's personnel records. The law prohibits disclosure of the records to a third party, except in certain situations,such as if a court orders the release or if theirrelease is necessary to prevent physical harm orthe commission of a crime. Additionally, the law states that the rights provided in the legislation are in addition to,and not instead of, other rights that may be30NEW LAWS2001Highlights available to an employee under existing law or contract. The law was sponsored in the Senate by Sen. Twyla Ring (DFL-North Branch). HF604/SF564*/CH145 Personnel provisions A new law makes several changes to the state 's public employee personnel laws. The measure, sponsored by Rep. Steve Dehler (R-St. Joseph) and Sen. Julie Sabo (DFL-Mpls),is the Department of Employee Relationshousekeeping law. Included in law is an extension of a pilot project that began in 1995. That program gavethe department the authority to establish acomputerized system that evaluates requiredskills of open positions matching resumes ofapplicants with open jobs. The resumes arethen forwarded to the agency seeking to fill avacancy without the traditional ranking ofapplicants. The program was in addition to the formal state hiring procedure that includes a variety oftesting requirements for various jobclassifications. The program was established to remove bar- riers that discouraged state agencies from tak-ing innovative approaches to improving ser-vices and achieving cost savings. Under the new law, the pilot project is ex- tended, effective May 3, 2001, until full imple-mentation of the re-engineered selection pro-cess is complete, or until July 1, 2005, which-ever occurs first. Effective Aug. 1, 2001, the balance of the new law also establishes that a state employee 's identification number will not be the same asthe employee 's social security number because the identification number is publicinformation. New legislation also clarifies that the chief executive officers in the Department ofHuman Services are in unclassified state civilservice positions.

Jesse Ventura signed a new law that focuses on building power plants, includingincreasing distributed generation, and increas-ing conservation spending requirements formunicipal and cooperating utilities. The new law results from extended debate in both the House and Senate over the futuredirection of energy policy in Minnesota. Sup-porters call it a positive step to prevent poten-tial energy problems, like those suffered inother states in recent years. Beginning Aug. 1, 2001, power companies will face a more streamlined permitting pro-cess, making it quicker and, therefore, lessexpensive. Sponsors hope the law will have theeffect of cutting the time a coal or gas powerplant comes online in half. Under previouslaw, such a plant spends four to six years goingthrough the entire process of obtaining a per-mit and finding a site. The law also creates incentives for distrib- uted generation \u2014 small power plants \u2014 not previously being promoted by the state. Theplants, which can be powered by natural gas, hydrogen, or wind or solar power, are cleanerand easier to site. All utilities are required to invest 5 percent over five years into distributed generation andrenewable generation, under the law. Also,customers will be able to choose how much oftheir energy comes from renewable energy,effective Aug. 1, 2001. The new law orders the Public Utilities Com- mission to report to the Legislature utilities ' progress for renewable energy sources such assolar, wind, hydroelectric, or biomass. Whilethe law does not provide specific mandates fordeveloping renewable energy options, it givescompanies time to advance in that area. Thisportion is also effective Aug. 1, 2001. A study allows time to develop an adequate gauge of the industry 's capabilities for renew- able energy, as well as the opportunity to deter-mine a proper level should mandates be im-posed, sponsors said. The law requires utilitiesto make \"good faith efforts \" to provide 10 percent of their energy by renewable sourcesby 2015. Those eligible for the state 's conservation improvement program will also face differentguidelines under the new law, such as a nar-rower and tighter definition for what qualifiesas conservation. This provision is effectiveJan. 1, 2002. The law does not include further restrictions on emissions for power plants nor does itaddress more assistance for low-income resi-dents to help cover rising energy costs \u2014 par- ticularly heating and air conditioning. Both ofthose concerns were expressed by testifiers andmembers during the 2001 session. Additionally, the Department of Commerce is directed to develop a comprehensive energyreport to the Legislature by Dec. 1, 2001. Afinal report is due in December 2002. Rep. Ken Wolf (R-Burnsville) and Sen. James Metzen (DFL-South St. Paul) were thesponsors. HF659/SF722*/CH212 Loan program expanded An existing energy loan program law that previously only served rental housing will in-clude owner-occupied residential housing,under a new law. The program is funded with Exxon Oil over- charge money. In the 1980s, Exxon was over-charging customers for the cost of thecompany 's product and had to reimburse the state for the cost of overcharges. In 1993 the31Highlights NEW LAWS2001 Legislature placed some of the money into a revolving loan account for conservation forrenters. According to state law, half of the over- charge money is appropriated for specificprojects reviewed by the Legislative Commis-sion on Minnesota Resources. The rest of the money is available for energy conservation projects that directly serve low-income Minnesotans. However, that moneymust be specifically appropriated in law inorder to be used for that purpose. The new lawexpands the use of the revolving fund to in-clude low-income, owner-occupied residen-tial homes. The new law also lifts a restriction that people eligible for the loan must live in the Twin Citiesmetropolitan area; now, loans may be pro-vided in any area of the state. The law, sponsored by Rep. Ken Wolf (R- Burnsville) and Sen. James Metzen (DFL-SouthSt. Paul), is effective Aug. 1, 2001. HF1367*/SF1306/CH147 Heating help provided Low-income families received 2001 heating assistance two weeks early, under a new law. The law, sponsored by Rep. Dan McElroy (R- Burnsville) and Sen. Richard Cohen (DFL-St.Paul), released $12.2 million in federal moneyon Feb. 3, 2001, the law 's effective date, that would have otherwise not been granted untilFeb. 13. The Low-Income Heating Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), a program of the U.S.Department of Health and Human Services,provides services that help income-eligiblehouseholds keep their homes heated throughthe winter. Households meeting the incomelimits can receive a one-time grant, which isusually paid to their heating vendor. Grant size is based on the number of people in the household, gross household income, fueltype, and fuel consumption from the previouswinter. The households with the lowest incomesand highest bills receive the largest grants. The program also provides emergency heat- ing system repair for households in a no-heatsituation or have had their service discontin-ued or interrupted. McElroy said the program received many more applications during late 2000 and early2001 than in the past due to high energy costsfrom the winter. He said the average grant was$400 to $500 per family.

Included in the new law are funds for the Department of Natural Resources, Departmentof Agriculture, Pollution Control Agency, Of-fice of Environmental Assistance, Board ofWater and Soil Resources, and otherorganizations. Spending from the state 's general fund for these efforts will total about $548 million. Thefunding formula is complex because the moneycomes from numerous sources in addition togeneral tax revenues, including user fees, li-censes, surcharges, lottery proceeds, and fed-eral funds. Gone from the measure are three projects totaling $780,000 that were line-item vetoedby the governor. (See related story, page 90) Also not included in the new law is amandate that diesel fuel contain a percentage of biodiesel, which many legislators had sup-ported. This language was removed during theregular session. (See related story, page 91) Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater) and Sen. Leonard Price (DFL-Woodbury) sponsoredthe measure. Here are some highlights. All provisions are effective July 1, 2001, unless noted otherwise. 2001 Special Session: HF10/SF10*/CH2 Nurturing nature The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) will receive the largest percentage ofthe new law 's funding \u2014 some $594 million \u2014 for projects including firefighting, mineralsresearch, state park operations, snowmobilegrants-in-aid, and fish and wildlifemanagement. One provision will designate $12 million to maintain a trained force of firefighters to handlethe annual demands of Minnesota 's fire sea- son. Supporters of this provision testified that\"smokechasers, \" seasonal wildland firefighters, have been leaving Minnesota for more lucra-tive offers with other states or the federal gov-ernment.

HF274*/SF70/CH47 Wetland laws simplified Confusion over the differing rules and agen- cies regulating Minnesota 's wetlands led to the passage of a new law designed to simplify wet-land and public water laws. The legislationbuilds upon consolidation efforts approved bythe 2000 Legislature. Wetlands are recognized as a valuable re- source for a number of reasons. Collectively,they provide wildlife and fish habitats, reduceflooding and soil erosion, and improve waterquality. Under existing law, it is illegal for landown- ers and developers to drain or fill in certainwetland property unless they have establisheda replacement plan with the proper authori-ties. This permit process can be difficult be-cause a variety of local, state, and federal agen-cies have jurisdiction over wetland areas, andthe new law aims for consistent regulation. The Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR), together with the Department ofNatural Resources (DNR), coordinates thewater and soil resources planning activities ofcounties, soil and water conservation units,and watershed management organizationswithin the state.34NEW LAWS2001Highlights BWSR 's Permanent Wetland Preserves Pro- gram pays landowners to place eligible wet-lands under permanent conservation ease-ments. The new law expands program eligibil-ity to additional types of wetlands and pro-vides for an alternative payment option basedon the fair market value of the land if it weredrained. Another provision gives the water and soil board more flexibility in determining acreagereplacement ratios and values. Effective Aug. 1, 2001, a number of provi- sions in the new law are designed to streamlinethe application and appeal process. Watersheddistricts will be granted the same authority thatcounties now have to accept applications forwetland preservation areas and the DNR isallowed to waive their permit authority to localgovernments for certain public transportationprojects. Additionally, the new law will extend from 15 to 30 the number of days a landowner has toappeal a wetland decision. Another provision allows the DNR and peace officers to file a deed restriction with the countyrecorder if a property owner does not complywith a wetland or public waters restorationorder. Prospective buyers will benefit fromthis information because future landownersare still responsible for restoration orreplacement. Also, the new law will require the DNR to restore Bieloh Pond in Walker, Minn. Thepond was drained in Spring 2001 when theDNR removed a water level control device, andthe ensuing public outcry resulted in a com-promise between the department and the cityto re-fill the pond. The provision just rein-forces their agreement. Rep. Dennis Ozment (R-Rosemount) and Sen. Dan Stevens (R-Mora) sponsored themeasure. HF1828*/SF1486/CH146 State park boundary changes A new law will redraw the boundaries of several state parks and recreation areas for anet gain of 6,358 acres.

The new law also affects boathouse lot leases in the Soudan Underground Mine State Park.With certain specific limitations, an owner of aboathouse lease at Stuntz Bay will be allowed toreceive a lifetime lease when the present leaseexpires. Each year, adjustments are made to state parklands, but they require action by theLegislature in order to be official. Rep. Thomas Bakk (DFL-Cook) and Sen. Dennis Frederickson (R-New Ulm) sponsoredthe measure. HF1071/SF1082*/CH182Expediting permits A new law effective Aug. 1, 2001 authorizes the state Pollution Control Agency (PCA) toexpedite permits for new or expandedfacilities. The new law will allow people who want to construct or expand a facility regulated by theagency to pay for additional expenses incurredin expediting a permit. This payment will be in addition to regular permit fees and must reflect the costs of staffovertime or consultant services that are neededto expedite a permit review. The agency may agree to an expedited per- mit process as long as it does not interfere withits permitting program priorities. An applicant 's reimbursement must be paid in advance and is not contingent upon theactual issuing of a permit. Rep. Howard Swenson (R-Nicollet) and Sen. David Knutson (R-Burnsville) were thesponsors. HF1827/SF1613*/CH11635Highlights NEW LAWS2001 Conservation officer reviews A new state law prohibits the Enforcement Division of the Department of Natural Re-sources (DNR) from establishing game andfish citation quotas for its roughly 140 conser-vation officers. At the request of the conservation officers ' union, a new law removes an exception to thisprohibition that they felt unfairly allowed DNRmanagement to compare the enforcement ac-tivity of conservation officers for performanceevaluations. Officers maintained that numbers of tickets should not be weighted more heavily againsttheir overall efforts that also include issuingwarnings, improving response times, and com-munity education. They were concerned that they could be downgraded in reviews if their citation num-bers didn 't meet the average, which in effect resulted in quotas. Effective April 25, 2001, the new law aims to alleviate those concerns by eliminating thereference and making the statutory languagegoverning conservation officers more in linewith similar state highway patrol provisions. Rep. Dennis Ozment (R-Rosemount) and Sen. Tony Kinkel (DFL-Park Rapids) spon-sored the measure. HF501/SF283*/CH32 PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID A new law prohibits the Enforcement Division of the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) fromestablishing game and fish citation quotas for its roughly 140 conservation officers. The new law wasrequested by the conservation officers ' union. The omnibus environment and agriculture funding law also will provide for the hiriing of new officers. Pollution prevention A new law clarifies the enforcement author- ity of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency(PCA) over the state 's regulated facilities. The PCA 's Environmental Audit Program encourages businesses and local governmentsto voluntarily monitor and report potentialpollution hazards before minor problems be-come major liabilities. Participants are pro-tected from penalties in many cases, unlessthey have a poor track record or it is deter-mined their activities are criminal or couldpose a serious environmental or public healththreat. Participation does not guarantee that viola- tors will avoid fines and other penalties. Thenew law allows the PCA to proceed with en-forcement actions under certain additional cir-cumstances depending upon when the viola-tion occurred or was reported. Major facilities, including feedlots with more than 1,000 animal units and hazardous wastetreatment plants, are required to preparepollution prevention plans in addition to filingaudit reports. Another provision in the newlaw clarifies the definition of \"major facility \" for environmental audit purposes. Effective Aug. 1, 2001, the new law also requires the PCA to publish by April 1 of everyyear a separate report detailing the most recentinformation on air and water pollution in thestate, including figures that illustrate potentialRegulating water consumption Effective Aug. 1, 2001, a new law aims to protect the groundwater supply by closing whathas been referred to as the \"once-through cool- ing loophole \" in the state 's water laws. The once-through cooling systems that have generated concern use groundwater for tem-perature or humidity control and then dis-charge the water into a storm sewer or otheroutlet without returning it to its original source.Industrial processors and other facilities thatuse water for air conditioning are regulated bythe Department of Natural Resources (DNR). In 1990, the Legislature determined that facilities using more than five million gallonsannually for this purpose must phase out themethod by 2010 and equipment must be con-verted to work more efficiently. Also, the DNR stopped issuing expansion permits to these installations in 1991. Once-through cooling water use has decreased from11 billion gallons in 1989 to 4.22 billion gallonsin 1999, according to DNR figures. In 1992, the H.B. Fuller Company asked the Legislature to make an exception for theirVadnais Heights facility because their waterwas discharged into a wetland and a naturepreserve had been created. The Legislaturecomplied by creating a provision that allowedcertain installations to continue once-throughcooling operations beyond 2010 if they dis-charged the water into a nature preserve. However, under the new law, no company will be allowed to circumvent the law by creat-ing a nature or other preserve with the water. The Fuller company was the only entity to qualify under this provision until 2000, whenGeneral Mills wanted to expand once-throughwater consumption at its Golden Valley site.They sought approval under the nature pre-serve exception, but the proposal was met withresistance from the DNR and the two sidesended up in court. Although the department and General Mills ultimately reached an agreement and the com-pany instead went with a more water-wiseplan, some legislators and DNR officials de-cided it was time to clarify the statutessources of pollution and reflect the total and percentage increase or decrease from the pre-vious year. Previously the agency included thisinformation in its annual performance report. Rep. Bud Nornes (R-Fergus Falls) and Sen. Linda Higgins (DFL-Mpls) sponsored thelegislation. HF2028*/SF1785/CH18736NEW LAWS2001Highlights State land swaps and sales A new natural resources law authorizes a number of state land transactions, clarifiesDepartment of Natural Resources (DNR) au-thority over charges for the use or sale of state-owned lands, and revises a couple of trapping-related rules. Effective Aug. 1, 2001, the new law estab- lishes the Hill Lake Wildlife Management Areain Aitkin County and adds land to Hill LakeRiver State Forest and the Aitkin State WildlifeManagement Area. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the DNR Wildlife Management Area program.Through donations and acquisitions, morethan one million acres of land have been setaside for public hunting and wildlife observa-tion. The program supports habitat restora-tion and wildlife regeneration and is funded inpart by a surcharge on small game huntinglicenses. Occasionally, the department will determine the state 's interests would best be served if state-owned land were sold or exchanged. Thenew law grants legislative approval in the fol-lowing cases, with qualifications: the private sale of a parcel of state-owned land to Lake County, the public sale of school trust fund land border- ing White Iron Lake in Lake County, the public sale of a parcel of state-owned land along Minnesota Trunk Highway 61 in LakeCounty, the conveyance of state-owned land in the Mentel Wildlife Management Area in Mower Countyback to its original private owners, an exchange of state-owned land in Brooklyn Park for land owned by North Hennepin Com-munity College, and the private sale by Aitkin County of a parcel of consolidated-conservation land to Hill City. The new law also clarifies that a parcel of agricultural real estate will retain its exemptstatus in an exchange between the city of BirdIsland and a private party. Another provision will allow the DNR to exchange leased farmed wild rice land forcounty land, including tax-forfeited land. State agencies are generally not allowed to increase fees for goods, services, or licenseswithout approval by the Legislature. Anotherprovision in the new law exempts from legisla-tive approval certain charges for the use or saleof state-owned lands and minerals by the DNR. A separate provision allows party trapping, similar to party hunting, where a member of atrapping party may take more than the legallimit of small game as long as the total numbertaken by the group does not exceed the com-bined limits of all members of the party. Another trapping-related provision in the new law requires that bobcat, fisher, pine mar-ten, and otter pelts must be registered at a DNRwildlife office before they are sold or beforethey are transported out of state, and at least Area of detailCommunity connections When the Blufflands Trail System in south- eastern Minnesota was authorized by theLegislature in 1992, the statutory language im-plied that future trail connections had to in-clude certain towns within the region. The listhas grown over the years and now reaches intoFillmore, Houston, Olmsted, and Winonacounties. Effective Aug. 1, 2001, a new law clarifies that linking up with the trail system is volun-tary for those communities. There are plans to expand the trail system and landowners along future routes were con-cerned that local governments seeking rights-of-way would have the upper hand in negotia-tions if the law said the trail had to include acertain community. \"It gave the cities an unfair hammer, \"governing this process. Under the new law, the Fuller campus will be grandfathered in butother facilities must continue to phase outwater consumption for air conditioning by2010. Another provision re-establishes the DNR 's ability to charge certain water permit applica-tion fees that were inadvertently removed in a1999 law. The new law also expands thedepartment 's authority to issue a certain class of water use permits for a number of minimal-impact water consumption activities. Finally, the new law confirms that the DNR will cooperate with the U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers in the inventory and repair of damsthat were built in the 1930s and early 1940s bythe Civilian Conservation Corps and WorksProjects Administration, or Works ProgressAdministration as it was called before 1939.

The law specifies that ash from the burning of a structure for legitimate training purposesmust be classified as demolition debris andmay be disposed of in a \"permit by rule \" land disposal facility or a permitted demolition land-fill, with the consent of the landfill operator. Structures used in fire training exercises must be adequately prepared, under the law, includ-ing the removal of hazardous materials. Inaddition, fire training exercises must meet allapplicable concerns and regulations, includ-ing state Pollution Control Agency guidelinesregarding the removal of hazardous materials,such as asbestos. The new law stems from what PCA officials called taking a hard stand on what was beingburned and their desire to have the materialtreated as hazardous because of potentiallydangerous items in the building such as leadand mercury. On the other hand, fire personnel said they needed to burn structures for training pur-poses in order to do their job effectively andsafely. They also said it was too expensive todispose of ash as hazardous material, but ifthey had to training time would be reduced. Ultimately the bill is a compromise between fire marshals and the PCA aided by Reps. BobGunther (R-Fairmont) and Dennis Ozment(R-Rosemount).

HF790/SF702*/CH27Effective March 17, 2001, the law was prompted by a need to resolve a contentiouslake-level dispute that arose from a 1996 dropin the lake level of about 12 inches. The dropfollowed the county 's removal of vegetation and sediment upstream from the Coon Lakeoutlet structure that was impeding water flowand contributing to high lake levels. A group of lakeshore owners filed a lawsuit against the county and the DNR claiming dam-ages. The suit was suspended in 1998 pendinga study on raising the lake level. Following a feasibility study mandated by the 1999 Legislature, the DNR proposed mak-ing an experimental modification to the lakeoutlet structure to raise the lake 's elevation. The alteration to the outlet structure can beremoved if it is found to cause any seriousproblems for affected property owners. The measure was sponsored by Rep. Tom Hackbarth (R-Cedar) and by Sen.

The threshold level for organizations re- quired to have an annual financial review ofgambling funds will also climb from $50,000 to$150,000. Noontime bingo will be allowed under the new law. Currently, establishments that con-duct bingo games are restricted to having nomore than 10 bingo occasions each week. Atleast 15 bingo games must be held at each occa-sion, and each bingo event must continue for atleast 90 minutes, but not more than four hours. The new law will allow an organization to conduct bingo between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. andavoid the 15-game and time limit requirements. The new law will also permit the card club at Canterbury Park to hold one tournament peryear lasting no longer than 14 days. It wouldallow for more than 50 tables to be in useduring tournament play.

Effective Aug. 1, 2001, the new law specifies that child support payments collected by apublic agency must be credited as of the datethe payment is received by the central collec-tions unit. Sen. Arlene Lesewski (R-Marshall), who sponsored the measure in the Senate, said threeconstituents brought to her attention that childsupport payments mailed to the public au-thority are sometimes credited to the monthfollowing the month for which they are in-tended. As a result, she said the collectionagency sometimes indicates that parents arelate in paying child support, which can sendred flags to officials and others. Allowing the collection agency to declare that parents were late in payment after onlyone month 's cycle created \"a lot of animosity between couples, \" Lesewski said. The law requires the public authority to make reasonable efforts to ensure that auto-mated enforcement remedies take into consid-eration the time periods under the incomewithholding statute. The law also permits the public authority to submit debt for recollection only if the personowing money is in arrears in an amount greaterthan his or her total monthly support or main-tenance payment. Rep. Richard Mulder (R-Ivanhoe) sponsored the law in the House. HF2207/SF2022*/CH134provision will prevent counties from initiating prosecution until \"there has been an attempt to obtain a court order holding the person incontempt for failing to pay child support, \" according to the law. Explaining that \"criminal prosecution is not the way to collect child support, \" Smith said, the law \"puts another civil step in the way \" before counties could initiate criminal proceedings. Other provisions in the new law specify that a person obliged to pay child support has com-mitted a gross misdemeanor if she or he fails topay support for longer than 90 days but notmore than 180 days. That carries a punishmentof up to one year in prison and a fine of up to$3,000. A parent or spouse who is more than 180 days overdue with their payment or is in ar-rears in an amount equal or greater than ninetimes the monthly support will have commit-ted a felony under the new law. The maximumsentence for this crime could be up to two yearsand a fine of up to $5,000. Sen. David Knutson (R-Burnsville) spon- sored the legislation in the Senate.

The new law gives the responsibility for detaining suspects to club security personnel.Security personnel may also require the sus-pect to provide or verify identification. Secu-rity can also inquire as the whether the personpossesses any illegal contraband. Under the law, the detained person has the right to be promptly informed of the purposeof the detention and may not be subjected tounnecessary or an unreasonable amount offorce. The person cannot be detained for morethan one hour except when a peace officer orguardian of a minor cannot accept custodywithin that hour.

Jesse Ventura spends around$774.6 million for the two-year operating bud-gets of Minnesota 's constitutional offices, the Legislature, and state departments. Rep. Phil Krinkie (R-Shoreview) and Sen.Richard Cohen (DFL-St. Paul) were the spon- sors of the measure. The following are highlights of the law. All provisions are effective July 1, 2001, unlessotherwise noted. 2001 Special Session: HF9/SF9*/CH10 Salary increases The law will increase the salaries of all the state 's constitutional officers except the gover- nor. The increases, based on a percentage ofthe governor 's salary, take effect Jan. 6, 2003. Currently the governor 's annual salary is $120,300. Under the new law, the attorney general 's salary is set at 95 percent of the governor 's, the state auditor at 85 percent, the secretary ofstate at 75 percent, and the lieutenant governorat 65 percent. Currently, the lieutenant governor, the state treasurer (whose office will be abolished in2003) and the secretary of state all make $66,168.The attorney general 's salary is $93,983, while the state auditor makes $72,187. (Art. 1, Sec. 2) The attorney general 's office also receives $2.4 million over the biennium for salary in-creases. Cohen said the increase is necessaryfor the state to compete with the private sectorfor qualified attorneys. (Art. 1, Sec. 6)Horse track employment regulations (See Recreation, page 67) 40NEW LAWS2001Highlights Oversight of the Met Council The new law establishes a legislative com- mission to oversee the Metropolitan Council 's operating and capital budgets and the workand capital improvement programs. The commission will be composed of seven members each from the House and Senate.The committee chair would alternate each yearbetween the two bodies. Sponsors of the measure said the relation- ship between the Legislature and the TwinCities metropolitan area 's planning agency has become strained over the years because of alack of communication and collaboration. In previous years both the House and Senate had separate committees for local governmentand metropolitan affairs issues and the deci-sion to merge those two committees into onehas meant less time to oversee the Metropoli-tan Council 's activities. The new law requires the commission to monitor, review, and make recommendationsto the council on the tax rate and dollar amountof the agency 's property tax levies and any proposed increases. The commission will also monitor and make recommendations on appointments to thecouncil. (Art. 2, Sec. 13) Public TV going digital The law provides $7.8 million to the Depart- ment of Administration for grants to noncom-mercial television stations for a conversion todigital technology. The grant money will beused to leverage federal matching dollars. A mandate from the Federal Communica- tions Commission requires that all public tele-vision stations convert from an analog signalto digital by May 2003. Beginning in 2003,stations will still be able to broadcast with ananalog signal provided they have a digital sig-nal, as well. Once 85 percent of the homes inthe station 's market are capable of receiving a digital signal, the station will be required tostop its analog transmissions. The appropriation is far below the requested $21 million to address the conversion requiredby the federal government. Cohen said the lackof funding could lead to the shutdown of thepublic television station in Bemidji and couldadversely affect the Twin Cities station 's pro- gramming. (Art. 1, Sec. 12) The new law also creates a legislative work group consisting of legislators and representa-tives of public television to examine the best wayto take advantage of the digital technology andprovide gavel-to-gavel coverage of House andSenate floor sessions and committee hearings. The work group is required to make specific Effective March 1, 2003, the cost of a fishing license for seniors age 65 and above will increasefrom $6.50 to $17, the same amount paid by anglers under age 65.PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID The omnibus state government finance law appropriates $7.8 million in fiscal year 2002 for grants tononcommercial television stations, such as KTCA-TV in the Twin Cities, to assist with conversion to a digitalbroadcast signal as mandated by the federal government. recommendations regarding the consolidationof House and Senate television services includ-ing \"the advisability and practicality \" of hav- ing the coverage provided by public television. The working group interim report is due to the Legislature by Feb. 1, 2002 with a finalreport, including budget recommendations,due by Jan. 10, 2003. (Art. 1, Sec. 2)Analyzing transit projects The new law requires that the Department of Transportation may not approve a contractor purchase of goods or services for transit or other transportation purposes in an amount greater than $10 million unless a cost-benefitanalysis is completed that shows a positivebenefit to the public. LICENSE SNAG41Highlights NEW LAWS2001 In 1999 the Legislature passed a similar pro- vision for contracts valued at more than$5 million, but the provision was repealed thefollowing year. The requirement was one of the issues involved in a lawsuit Rep. Krinkie filed againstthe governor in 2000 claiming that Venturafailed to follow the provisions of the law re-quiring the cost-benefit analysis. The depart-ment completed a cost effectiveness study butKrinkie said the benefits of the Hiawatha Cor-ridor light-rail project should have been com-pared with other transit systems such as buses.That lawsuit was later dismissed. The new law applies to contracts that are expected to have a useful life of more thanthree years, and does not apply to purchases inresponse to a natural disaster. The new law sunsets on June 30, 2003. (Art. 2, Sec. 41) Double duty The new law allows legislative appointing authorities to work with the Department ofEmployee Relations in placing legislative staffon temporary assignments in state agencies.The Legislature remains responsible for thesalary and benefits of those employees. The law specifies that the assignments and hours must be negotiated between the legisla-tive appointing authorities and the state agen-cies. Refusal by a department commissioner tofind a suitable work assignment for interestedand qualified legislative staff is required to bereported to the finance committee chairs of theHouse and Senate that have jurisdiction overthat agency 's budget. (Art. 1, Sec. 2) Amateur sports The Department of Administration 's man- agement analysis division in consultation withthe Amateur Sports Commission is required toreport to the Legislature by Jan. 15, 2002, a planfor the commission to operate without a statesubsidy. The commission was created in 1987 to promote the economic and social benefits ofamateur sports. The measure requires that the plan describe new revenues the commission would obtain toreplace state funding, or plans for cost reduc-tions so the anticipated revenues would equalexpenditures without state subsidies. (Art. 1,Sec. 12) I do, but first ... Couples who complete at least 12 hours of premarital education, including the teachingof communication and conflict management PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY ANDREW VON BANK A policy provision in the state government finance law allows for a reduced $20 marriage license fee forcouples who receive at least 12 hours of premarital education from a clergy member or designee or amarriage and family therapist. Qualified education must include the use of a pre-marital inventory andcommunication and conflict management skills. skills, can obtain a marriage license for a feereduced from $70 to $20. The law specifies that counseling can be provided only by a licensed or ordained min-ister, a person authorized to perform marriageceremonies, or a licensed marriage or familycounselor. The measure stipulates that $15 of the $20 fee remains with the county in which the li-cense is granted. The remaining $5 will be usedjust as it was under the previous system \u2014 $3 will go to the special revenue fund in the De-partment of Children, Families and Learningfor child visitation centers and $2 will go theDepartment of Health for teen pregnancy pre-vention efforts. A similar bill passed both the House and Senate in 2000, but was vetoed by Gov. Venturabecause it increased all marriage license fees to$75. The Senate overrode the veto, but theHouse was unsuccessful in its attempt. (Art. 2,Sec. 82) Learning opportunities Members of the Minnesota National Guard will be eligible for a greater tuition and text-book reimbursement grant under the new law. The law increases from 75 percent to 80 percent the maximum tuition reimburse-ment amount for certain College of LiberalArts programs at the University of Minnesota,and for other specified institutions. Officers from the guard testified that the percentage increase will provide for moreflexibility in using the recruitment and reten- tion incentive. They sought a 100 percent al-lowance, but Rep. Krinkie said full reimburse-ment for some members would mean fewermembers could access the benefit. The percentage increase will expire June 30, 2003. (Art. 2, Sec. 64) Election equipment grants A $1.9 million appropriation to the com- missioner of administration is provided underthe new law for a grant program to help localunits of government update their voting equip-ment. Before making grants the commissionermust receive a recommendation from thesecretary of state. In order to qualify for the grant money, a county or city is required to purchase precinct-based optical scan ballot tabulation equip-ment. Currently many Greater Minnesotacounties use a central count optical scan sys-tem whereby cities bring their ballots to acentral location for ballots to be tabulated. Precinct-based optical scan machines allow voters who have incorrectly marked a ballotthe option of correcting the mistake beforeleaving the polling place. The new law requires the local unit of gov- ernment to provide a dollar-for-dollar matchof the grant that cannot come from state orfederal money. (Art. 18, Sec. 26)42NEW LAWS2001Highlights Other election provisions Military service personnel and others resid- ing overseas will be allowed to submit an ab-sentee ballot application by fax under the newlaw. The law also will allow those voters to re- quest an absentee ballot by e-mail if thesecretary of state makes the determination thatsecurity concerns have been adequatelyaddressed. The measure is an attempt to increase the likelihood that those individuals overseas canget their ballots in on time. (Art. 18, Sec. 15) The law also specifies that ballots for mili- tary and overseas voters must be prepared andfurnished in accordance with federal law. Infederal election law, there are particular datesby which the ballot must be prepared and sentto allow those voters a chance to get theirballots back to election officials in time.(Art. 18, Sec. 15) Another provision of the law authorizes the secretary of state to develop voting instruc-tions in languages other than English to beposted and made available in polling placesduring elections. (Art. 18, Sec. 24) The state 's chief election official is also re- quired to license a touch sensitive voting sys-tem for experimental use at an election beforeits approval for general use to permit blind orvisually impaired voters to cast a ballotindependently. (Art. 18, Sec. 38) PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID Public radio stations will receive $407,000 for equipment and community service grants in the nextbiennium, under the omnibus state government funding law. State pays up Approximately $251,000 is appropriated, under a new law effective July 1, 2001, thatprovides payments for the annual claims madeagainst the state. The claims vary in size and scope. Each year, the Legislative Coordinating Commission jointHouse-Senate Subcommittee on Claims meetsto hear the claims and determine which oneshave met the established threshold. Claims can affect any number of the differ- ent state agencies, as well. The new law provides more than $12,000 to the Department of Corrections for claims formedical services provided to individuals whowere injured while performing communityservice or sentencing to service work. To the Department of Natural Resources, the new law appropriates about $135,000 forclaims. One such claim involves reimbursingan organization for costs incurred as part of aproject entered into with the department thatwas abandoned because of concerns raised bythe federal government and Wisconsin offi-cials. Another grants money for a case wherean individual inadvertently lost income be-cause of the enforcement of invalid rules. The Department of Revenue is appropriated $13,098 under the law to reimburse aMinnetonka company for its claim of a salesand use tax overpayment. The law also designates Willis Lake in Waseca County as a wildlife management lake as partof an agreement with an individual who re-ceives $9,423 under the law to pay for croplosses caused by the elevated level of the lake. A claim of nearly $440 is appropriated to the commissioner of transportation for paymentto a Wisconsin woman whose car was dam-aged by an unknown driver who knocked de-teriorated curbing into a highway entranceramp in Duluth. Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin) and Sen. Randy Kelly (DFL-St. Paul) were the sponsors. HF634*/SF648/CH169 Officer testing change A new law will make it easier for qualified applicants for openings on police departmentsto become eligible for hire. Under previous law, police civil service com- missions are authorized to administer periodicexaminations for candidates. Notice must bepublished stating the time, place, and scope ofeach examination. The commissions grade and classify all the employees and maintain a register of the names,classes, age, compensation, period of past em-ployment and other facts and data. They alsokeep a second register of those who have ap-plied for positions. The new law effective Aug. 1, 2001 allows police civil service commissions to administeradditional examinations from time to timeduring the life of the eligible register withoutfurther publication requirements to applicantsmeeting threshold requirements. Applicants who pass the later examination will then be added to the eligible register. Police officials say the new law will help cities struggling to find officers keep their po-lice force at full strength. Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove) and Sen. Charles Wiger (DFL-North St. Paul) were thesponsors. HF1465/SF1432*/CH87 Indian advisory council membership The Urban Indian Affairs Advisory Council, which advises the Indian Affairs Council, willhave one additional member, under a new laweffective Aug. 1, 2001. Established in 1963, the Indian Affairs Coun- cil is the official liaison between state and tribalgovernments. This council is governed by eachof the elected tribal chairs of the 11 reserva-tions in the state, and two at-large membersrepresenting American Indians who live inMinnesota, but are enrolled in other states. The new law will add a member from Bemidji, increasing the advisory council fromfive members to six. Existing law requires43Highlights NEW LAWS2001 members from Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Duluth. The urban advisory council 's role is to ad- vise board members on the unique problemsand concerns of American Indians who live inurban areas of the state. Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls) was the House sponsor, and Sen. Tony Kinkel (DFL-ParkRapids) sponsored the measure in the Senate. HF1687/SF1206*/CH88 Report extensions Charitable organizations can file reports with the state later in the calendar year, under a newlaw, effective April 25, 2001. Sponsored in the House by Rep. Sondra Erickson (R-Princeton), the new law changesthe deadline for charitable organizations to filean annual report with the state Attorney General 's Office from June 30 to July 15 if the organizationkeeps records on a calendar year basis. For thosethat operate on a fiscal year basis, the law changesthe deadline from six months after the close ofthe fiscal year to the 15th day of the seventhmonth after the end of the fiscal year. Erickson indicated the measure had been brought to her by the Minnesota Council ofNonprofits to address the different due datesestablished for filing reports to the state andfederal government. Annual reports are required from charitable organizations that solicit contributions. The stan-dard report filed with the attorney general in-cludes the legal name of the organization; itsform of organization; the address of its principaloffice; the names of officers, directors, and trust-ees; and the name of the chief executive officer. The annual report also includes a financial statement and a copy of tax returns. Erickson said the law will help simplify and streamline the process for Minnesotans, par-ticularly the efforts of nonprofit organizations. Sen. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope) spon- sored the measure in the Senate. HF2119*/SF1915/CH45Rules changes A new law will make a variety of technical changes to the state agency rulemaking pro-cess, in addition to the changes made inChapter 179. Administrative rules, which have the force of law, are drafted and proposed by state agen-cies in order to implement the laws passed bythe Legislature. There is a specific legal processthat agencies must go through before the rulesare adopted. The new law is based on changes put for- ward by the Office of Administrative Hearings,which is responsible for conducting the publichearings required in the rulemaking process. Among the changes under the new law is the authority of state agencies to withdraw a por-tion of a proposed rule before it takes effect.Under previous law the entire proposed rulemust be withdrawn. State law also requires public notice be given at various stages of the rulemaking process.That public notice requires the state agency tomail a copy of the proposed rule or a descrip-tion, summary, or citation of the rule to thosewho may be affected by the changes. The newlaw clarifies that many of the required descrip-tions or citations or summaries be \"easily read- able and understandable. \" The new law also specifies that public hear- ings cannot be canceled by an agency withinthree working days of the hearing. Rep. Eric Lipman (R-Lake Elmo) and Sen. Don Betzold (DFL-Fridley) were the sponsorsof the measure. The new law is effective Aug. 1, 2001.HF1537/SF780*/CH106 New rulemaking process The state agency rulemaking process will see a variety of changes under a new law. Administrative rules, which have the force of law, are drafted and proposed by state agen-cies in order to implement the technical proce-dures of laws passed by the Legislature. Thereis a specific legal process that agencies must gothrough before the rules are adopted. Rep. Marty Seifert (R-Marshall), the House sponsor of the law, said the changes come as aDesigner difference A new law will allow more flexibility in the state Designer Selection Board 's choice of de- signers for projects. Under previous law the board was prohib- ited from selecting a designer with whom aboard member had a current financial interest. The new law, effective Aug. 1, 2001, will allow a board member to abstain from partici-pating in the review, discussion, or selection ofa designer while allowing the rest of the boardto choose or not choose that designer. The board is responsible for selecting de- signers for state agency construction projectswith an estimated cost greater than $750,000or a planning project with estimated fees greaterthan $60,000. The board also selects primarydesigners for the University of Minnesota andMinnesota State Colleges and Universities forprojects involving construction or remodelingresult of a 2000 law that established a Rules Reform Task Force to make recommendationson how the state could improve its rulemakingprocess. The task force, which met between the 2000 and 2001 sessions, was composed of membersof the House and Senate, representatives fromstate agencies, Gov. Jesse Ventura 's staff, busi- ness people, and citizens. Rep. Gene Pelowski,Jr. (DFL-Winona) chaired the group. Under previous law, agencies draft proposed rules and then publish them in the State Regis-ter. A 30-day comment period was then re-quired. If 25 people requested a hearing on theproposed rules, a public hearing before anadministrative law judge must then be held. The new law establishes a process for the Legislature to delay implementation of rulesuntil it adjourns an annual session. The provi-sion would give the House and Senate standingcommittees with jurisdiction over subject mat-ter the opportunity to review new rules and todelay the adoption of rules by a majority voteof the entire committees until the full Legisla-ture adjourns. The new law also allows any person to peti- tion a state agency for a variance of a rule.Agencies are allowed to grant the variance withconditions attached or if the rule causes unduehardship. Additionally, a process to repeal obsolete rules is established by the new law. Under theprocess, an agency will identify obsolete rulesand draft a notice plan under which the agencywill make reasonable efforts to notify thosewho may be significantly affected by the rulerepeal. The agency is required to publish a legalnotice giving its intention to repeal the rules. If25 or more people request in writing that theywant a more thorough examination, the cus-tomary rulemaking process will be followed. The new law repeals the June 30, 2001 sunset of the governor 's rule veto authority. The governor is allowed to veto all or a portion of a rule by submitting notice of theveto to the State Register within 14 days ofreceiving a copy of the rule from the secretaryof state. The new law specifies that the veto iseffective when the veto notice is submitted tothe State Register. Sen. Don Betzold (DFL-Fridley) was the Senate sponsor. Most of the provisions of the new law are effective May 26, 2001.

Leonard Price (DFL-Woodbury) were thesponsors. HF1455/SF1435*/CH33 Hiring contractors for state projects The qualifications of those contracted to perform certain professional services for thestate could become more of the focus for selec-tion under a new law. Under previous state contracting laws, the awarding of a contract was based on best valuethat includes an evaluation of price and mayinclude other considerations such as environ-mental considerations, quality, and vendorperformance. Effective July 1, 2001, the new law will allow that state agency selection of contractors regu-lated by the Board of Architecture, Engineer-ing, Land Surveying, Landscape Architecture,Geoscience and Interior Design be based onqualifications and not necessarily on the low-est bid as in other state contracts. Under the measure, a state agency choosing to use this selection procedure would first rank contractors solely on their qualifications. Oncethose have been determined the agency wouldbe allowed to get pricing information. According to Jeff Coleman, a professional engineer from the board, the qualification-based section has been in place at the federallevel since 1972 and is used in at least 36 states. The new law also establishes procedures for screening and selecting contractors, and thoseprocedures may be adjusted to accommodatethe cost, scope, and schedule of a particularproject. Rep. Jim Rhodes (R-St. Louis Park) and Sen. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope) were thesponsors. HF724/SF1064*/CH100 Administration modifications A new law will modify some provisions for the state Department of Administration. The law will extend the authority for several advisory groups. the governor 's advisory council on Technol- ogy for People with Disabilities will be ex-tended until June 30, 2003. The councilidentifies underserved groups and helpsidentify state policies and resources avail-able to provide assistance via technology. the Small Business Procurement advisory council, which advises the commissioner ofadministration on matters regarding smallbusinesses participating in the program, nowsunsets June 30, 2003. the Construction Codes Council, which will substitute the commissioner of commercefor the commissioner of public safety as amember of the group, will sunset June 30,2003. the Governor 's Residence Council, which develops an overall restoration plan for theresidence and surrounding grounds and ap-proves alterations in the existing structure,is extended until June 30, 2003.In addition, the shared savings program for energy conservation in state-owned buildings,which encourages changes to promote energyefficiency by reducing consumption, will nowend Jan. 1, 2006. This provision is retroactiveto Jan. 1, 2001. Hinging on a provision already in statute, the new law clarifies that data on an individualneeded for a report for the Management Analy-sis division of the department will be keptprivate if the division reasonably determinesthat person would not have provided the in-formation otherwise. Also, the state information infrastructure will be made accessible to serve American In-dian tribal governments. Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) and Sen. Martha Robertson (R-Minnetonka) sponsoredthe legislation. With the exception of the sharedenergy savings program, the law 's provisions take effect Aug. 1, 2001. HF1938/SF1680*/CH162 Boards no more An annual law repealing several obsolete state agency administrative rules is effectiveAug. 1, 2001. Under previous law, state agencies were re- quired to submit to the governor, the Legisla-tive Coordinating Commission, the legislativepolicy and funding committees overseeing theagency, and the Revisor of Statutes a list of anyrules or portion of rules that are obsolete,unnecessary, or duplicative of other state orfederal statutes or rules. To repeal a rule an agency is required to publish a notice 18 months prior to the effec-tive date. There is a public hearing processagencies must follow in order to adopt, amend,or repeal rules. In the new law, several of the rules repeal references to state boards that no longer existsuch as the Public Employment RelationsBoard, the Collection Agency Advisory Board and the State Lottery Board. Rep. Marty Seifert (R-Marshall) and Sen. Mady Reiter (R-Shoreview) were the sponsorsof the measure.

Effective Jan. 1, 2003, the new law will make it easier for pharmacists to process claims. The uniform prescription drug information for uniform health care identification cardswill be required on cards issued in Minnesotabeginning July 1, 2003. The law states thatgroup purchasers must annually certify com-pliance with the card requirements. Information on the card will have to con- form to the format adopted by the NationalCouncil for Prescription Drug Programs, andall information must be presented in a \"clear, readable, and understandable manner. \" In order to make the cards more readable,the law also contains specifications for the card issuer name and telephone numbers and namesof contact persons that pharmacies may call forassistance. The national council is a non-profit organi- zation intended to create and promote datainterchange standards for the pharmacy ser-vices sector of the health care industry. Rep.

HF926*/SF1001/CH110 Potluck rules A new law effective Aug. 1, 2001 will permit schools to sponsor and hold potluck events inareas of the school other than school kitchens. The new law also allows fraternal and patri- otic organizations to sell home-prepared foodat certain organization-sponsored events. Previous law prohibited all licensed food establishments, including schools, from spon-soring potlucks. The law remains firm that food prepared for potlucks cannot be brought into any licensedfood establishment kitchen, including schoolkitchens. The measure was sponsored by Rep. Richard Mulder (R-Ivanhoe) in the House andSen. Arlene Lesewski (R-Marshall) in theSenate. HF967*/SF876/CH65 Better health communication Effective Aug. 1, 2001, a new law will en- courage more peer review among hospitals. The plan, sponsored by Rep. Carl Jacobson (R-Vadnais Heights) and Sen. Dallas Sams(DFL-Staples), will create an Internet-basedsystem for sharing information about medicalerrors and steps the organization used to cor-rect those problems. The idea behind the law is to help prevent other such incidents in health care facilities,since they carry such a significant cost to pa-tients and health care providers alike, Jacobsonsaid. \"But there is much more to it than cost, \" he said. \"There are also issues of consumer confi- dence and quality of care. Few would sacrificequality care for low price. I see this (law) as away to improve both quality and cost. \" Specifically, the law allows peer organiza- tions to participate in a standardized incidentreporting system that includes Internet-basedapplications, for the purpose of identifyingand analyzing trends in medical error and injuries resulting from drugs or surgery. Under previous law, peer review was al- lowed, but operation of a web-based systemwas not authorized. Jacobson said many healthcare professionals have not participated in peerreview because of the threat of a lawsuit. Hesaid other professionals could be making thesame mistakes that could be avoided by prac-tices as simple as changing the way drugs orsupplies are stored. He gave the example that a patient could be given a different dosage of a drug than wasprescribed. If both a double-strength dose anda full-strength dose are stored next to oneanother on the same shelf, it may be hard todifferentiate. Under the law, the data may be released by the peer review organization, and placed onthe Web site, as long as specific patients are notidentified in documents. Organizations andpeople involved in releasing the data are notliable for any damages as a result of complyingwith the new law, which sponsors hope willopen up the discussion more amongprofessionals. \"By creating this Web site, all facilities and professionals can learn from each other, \" Jacobson said. HF1081/SF560*/CH120 Lead poisoning, pay toilet changes A health policy law effective Aug. 1, 2001 will modify certain provisions relating to lead poi-soning prevention and will prohibit paytoilets. Sponsored by Rep. Bud Nornes (R-Fergus Falls) and Sen. Becky Lourey (DFL-Kerrick),the law features changes to environmentalhealth standards that were recommended bythe Minnesota Department of Health. In terms of lead poisoning prevention, the bill is partially technical in nature as it changesor redefines numerous terms, such as abate-ment, areas at high risk for toxic lead exposure,and encapsulation. The bill also clarifies that labs performing lead analysis of paint, soil, or dust must berecognized by the U.S. Environmental Protec-tion Agency under the Toxic Substances Con-trol Act. The law also states that drinking watersamples must be analyzed by a laboratory cer-tified by the commissioner of health to analyzelead in water. Furthermore, the law modifies certain pri- mary prevention program requirementsincluding:46NEW LAWS2001Highlights allowing a city board of health to determine areas at high risk for toxic lead exposurethereby eliminating the commissioner 's re- sponsibility for developing a priority list; having the commissioner maintain, not just develop, a primary prevention lead educa-tion strategy to prevent lead exposure; directing the commissioner to maintain lead- safe practices information; and adding guidance documents for regulated industries to the list of information thatmust be developed and maintained.A provision for testing of wells at the time of a property sale also prompted discussion onthe House floor because it had been deletedfrom the bill in committee, and remained ab-sent in the final product. According to Nornes,the requirement that wells be tested was op-posed by realtors who said it was an unneces-sary mandate. \"Why would we take out the well provi- sion? \" asked Rep. Al Juhnke (DFL-Willmar), who is a real estate appraiser, during debate.\"If you take out that requirement, who is responsible for cleaning up a bad well? \" The law also removes a provision in state statute regarding pay toilets. Previous law stated that any public facility with pay toilets or urinals must have at least asmany free toilets or urinals, and they must allbe maintained at the same standards of up-keep. Now pay toilets in public places, build-ings or conveyances are prohibited. The law had been on the books since 1975, and Nornes said it was obsolete. HF1304/SF1464*/CH205 Maternal death study Death is something many people do not want to reflect upon, but a new law will promptofficials to do just that. Effective Aug. 1, 2001, the law replaces a pre- vious statute with language authorizing the com-missioner to perform maternal death studies. Minnesota has conducted studies into ma- ternal deaths for several decades, but the legalauthorization for accessing health data with-out the subject 's consent to conduct these stud- ies expired July 1, 2000. Rep. Richard Mulder (R-Ivanhoe), who sponsored the measure in the House, said thestudies tracking maternal deaths are very im-portant from a public health perspective. Thefindings are used to develop policies and im-prove systems for women 's health care, while reducing the numbers of preventable maternaldeaths.\"The data is disturbing, \" Mulder said. \"The number one cause of pregnancy-related deathin this state is homicide. \" In the last year records were kept in the state (1999), 18 women died either while pregnantor within 12 months after the end of a preg-nancy. Of those deaths, seven were unrelatedto the pregnancy: causes of death includedhomicide, suicide, and car crashes. The death rate for African-American women is 400 percent higher than for white women,according to Mulder. Minnesota participates in a national study of maternal mortality led by the Centers forDisease Control. The Minnesota Chapter ofthe American College of Obstetricians andGynecologists will also receive reports on thestudy 's findings. For deaths on or after July 1, 2000 the law gives the commissioner access to medical data,medical examiner data and health records with-out consent of the subject, and without theconsent of their parent, spouse, or legal guard-ian when the subject is a woman who diedduring a pregnancy or within 12 months of afetal death, live birth, or other termination of apregnancy. However, the commissioner is required to attempt to notify these persons via certifiedmail before collecting data. Previous law re-quired consent from a patient or legal repre-sentative for the commissioner to obtain theinformation, for deaths occurring afterJuly 1, 2000. The law is explicit as to how data will be handled to protect the privacy of women andtheir families. For example, collected data maynot be used as evidence in any civil or criminalproceeding. After summaries are made, Mulder said all data that identifies individuals will be destroyed. The measure was sponsored in the Senate by Sen. Sheila Kiscaden (R-Rochester). HF1406*/SF1398/CH211 Nursing home closure A new law modifies plans governing how certain nursing facility chains can close facilities. In 2000, the Legislature established a process by which certain nursing home facility chainscould close up to seven sites and apply thesavings of closing those sites to their system.That law allowed chains to use projected medi-cal assistance cost savings from the closure. Effective April 25, 2001, cost savings can no longer be projected for certain facility closures. According to the new law, a nursing facilitychain cannot project medical assistance cost savings, for the purpose of closure, for a facilitylocated in an underserved area. Those areas aredefined as counties with ratios of nursing facilitybeds to residents age 85 and older in the lowestquartile, when compared to other counties. According to House sponsor, Rep. Jim Abeler (R-Anoka), the new law is intended to preventthe closure of the Good Samaritan home inAnoka. He said the new law will help \"protect access to those for whom access is the mostlimited. \" Sen. Leo Foley (DFL-Coon Rapids) spon- sored the Senate version. HF275*/SF210/CH36 Boxing, HMO modifications Gov. Jesse Ventura signed a new law that, along with several other provisions, will repealan old requirement that the commissioner ofhealth have regulatory power over professionalboxing matches. Rep. Richard Mulder (R-Ivanhoe), the House sponsor of the law, said there has beenonly one professional boxing match in Minne-sota in the past year. The law will eliminate the commissioner of health 's authority to regulate professional box- ing matches, transferring authority for over-seeing boxing contests to the Iowa AthleticCommission. Federal law requires oversight ofprofessional boxing matches to protect thehealth and safety of boxers. Authority to regu-late these matches was transferred from theBoard of Boxing to the commissioner duringthe 2000 session. The new law will also change the require- ments for health maintenance plans ' reporting schedules and for modifying rural hospitals ' program eligibility. Beginning Oct. 31, 2004, the law will allow health maintenance organizations (HMOs) tofile plans every four years instead of every twoyears. Previous law made for \"lots of paper- work and reporting, but nothing happens, \" Mulder said during the legislative session. Hesaid the law will substitute a progress reportevery two years. The new law will also expand the eligibility for rural hospital capital improvement grantsand rural hospital planning and transitiongrants from hospitals in communities withfewer than 5,000 people to those in communi-ties with fewer than 10,000 people. The law willwiden the definition of \"critical access hospi- tal\" to include hospitals in counties with, or counties contiguous to, areas designated as47Highlights NEW LAWS2001 medically underserved or with shortages of health professionals. The law also transfers regulatory authority over insurance policies for pre-need funeralgoods and other services from the commis-sioner of health to the commissioner ofcommerce. Sen. Dallas Sams (DFL-Staples) sponsored the measure in the Senate. Other than provi-sions pertaining to HMOs, the law is effectiveAug. 1, 2001. HF1407*/SF1415/CH171 PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID The Minnesota Board of Boxing is knocked out under a law passed by the 2001 Legislature. Under the law,the board 's duties are transferred to an Iowa organization. There was only one professional boxing match in Minnesota during 2000. Restraint rules A new law will amend regulations regarding the restraint of patients in treatment facilities,effective Aug. 1, 2001. Licensed peace officers will be added to the list of persons eligible to place someone inrestraint, under the new law. Previous law granted the right for someone \"to be free of restraints, \" but abridged that liberty if a competent person \"determines that (restraints) are necessary for the safety of thepatient or others. \" Prior to the new law, only the head of a treatment facility or a member ofthe medical staff could make such adetermination. The new law continues to restrict patient restraint, requiring that medical professionalsadhere to strict guidelines and record each useof restraints and the reason why they were usedin restrained patients ' records. Rep. Al Juhnke (DFL-Willmar), who sponsored the measure in the House, explainedthat the Kandiyohi County sheriff had re- quested the legal authority to restrain patientsbecause deputies were often called upon totransport patients, who then began acting outwhile in the squad car. Under previous law,deputies could only use restraints when explic-itly given permission by a doctor or anotherfamily member responsible for the patient 's treatment. \"I think we can trust our peace officers to choose when to appropriately use restraint, \" Juhnke said. Sen. Dean Johnson (DFL-Willmar) spon- sored the bill in the Senate. HF245/SF225*/CH26 Athletic trainer registration A new law makes changes to athletic train- ers' registration renewal and the Respiratory Care Practitioner Advisory Council. Effective June 30, 2001, the Board of Medi- cal Practice will be prohibited from renewingor restoring the registration of an athletic trainerwhose registration has lapsed for more thantwo years. The board requested the change outof concern for the trainer 's qualifications if the registration had expired. Therefore, the new law says an athletic trainer seeking to obtain new registration must meetall existing requirements, which include listingwork history and continuing education, as wellas taking an exam. The new law also extends the Respiratory Care Practitioner Advisory Council 's sunsetdate to June 30, 2003. It was previously set to expire on June 30, 2001. Rep. Richard Mulder (R-Ivanhoe) sponsored the legislation in the House, and Sen. LindaHiggins (DFL-Mpls) was the Senate sponsor. HF116/SF274*/CH31 Utilization review provisions A new law will tighten requirements for professionals who serve on utilization reviewpanels. Utilization review is the process health plan companies use to determine whether healthcare treatments or procedures are medicallynecessary or appropriate. The law, sponsored by Rep. Jim Rhodes (R- St. Louis Park) and Sen. John Hottinger (DFL-Mankato), is supported by the Board of Medi-cal Practice and the Minnesota MedicalAssociation. Effective Aug. 1, 2001, physicians who re- view cases in which a determination has beenmade to not certify a treatment or proceduremust be licensed in the state of Minnesota.Also, a psychiatrist who makes the final deter-mination to not certify mental health or sub-stance abuse treatment must be currently prac-ticing in the field of mental health or substanceabuse treatment and be licensed in Minnesota. Physician consultants must be board-certi- fied by the American Board of Medical Spe-cialists or the American Board of Osteopathy.Prior to the new law, board-certified physicianconsultants were included when needed oravailable. Utilization review organizations will now be required to submit to the commissioner of thestate Department of Commerce an annual re-port with the annual financial statement thatincludes the number and the rate per 1,000 ofclaims denied based on whether the proce-dures or services were necessary, under thelaw. The number and rate of denials over-turned on appeal must also be submitted. In addition to enrollees and providers, the review organizations must also provide, uponrequest, the commissioner of commerce withthe criteria used to determine the medical ne-cessity, appropriateness, and effectiveness of aprocedure or service. Finally, the Board of Medical Practice is authorized to investigate and discipline physi-cians performing utilization review who fail toexercise an appropriate degree of care in doingso. HF322/SF414*/CH13748NEW LAWS2001Highlights Immunity change The \"Good Samaritan Law \" grants immu- nity from civil damages to people who provideemergency medical care without expectationof being compensated unless the person acts ina willful and wanton or reckless manner inproviding the care, advice, or assistance. The law specifically granted immunity to people who use automatic externaldefibrillators to restart a heart as long as theyare not compensated. A new law effective May 18, 2001 says that civil immunity extends to people who use adefibrillator in the course of normal employ-ment, unless their normal duties include giv-ing emergency medical care. Therefore, a per-son whose job includes being able to use adefibrillator (such as an apartment manager)is granted immunity. At the same time, profes-sional emergency medical care providers areexplicitly excluded from the state 's Good Samaritan protections. The measure was endorsed by the American Heart Association. Good Samaritan laws are designed to en- courage average citizens to offer emergencymedical assistance by providing immunity fromcivil claims arising from \"acts or omissions \" in rendering care, advice, or assistance. Rep. Kevin Goodno (R-Moorhead) spon- sored the measure in the House and RandyKelly (DFL-St. Paul) sponsored it in theSenate. HF935/SF824*/CH107 Foreign-trained dentists A new law effective Aug. 1, 2001 will allow dental college graduates trained in other coun-tries to take the examination to be licensed topractice dentistry in Minnesota provided thatthe person 's training is at least equivalent to that provided by an accredited dental collegein the United States. Rep. Bud Nornes (R-Fergus Falls), sponsor of the measure in the House, said it would helpaddress a shortage of dentists in Minnesota. Itwas sponsored in the Senate by Sen. Cal Larson(R-Fergus Falls). Nornes said there is currently a need for another 250 dentists in the state and manydental offices are now scheduling appoint-ments four or five months in advance. A dentist from rural Minnesota testified that she could not meet the needs of a growingimmigrant population and she believes licens-ing foreign-trained dentists would help im-prove dental access for everyone.Members of the Board of Dentistry, which is responsible for protecting the safety of thepublic, spoke in favor of the measure. HF125*/SF104/CH37 Counselors ' licensing Drug and alcohol counselors will be subject to some new licensing requirements, effectiveAug. 1, 2001. Licensing provisions in a new law will re- quire applicants ' drug and alcohol counseling education to be supervised, regardless ofwhether they are applying for licensure withinthe first five years of licensing rules or after fiveyears. The new law also adds a group of people who can qualify for temporary licenses. In prior law, people were able to temporarily practice as drug and alcohol counselors priorto being licensed if the person had an associateor bachelor 's degree. Under the new law, the person may also temporarily practice counsel-ing with credentials from a national certifica-tion body or a certification or licensing bodyfrom another state or other jurisdiction. A person must apply for licensure within 90 days of passing the exam, under the new law,rather than 60 days, as was previously stated inlaw. The new law will also delete language that required people to request temporary practicestatus within a certain period, and that re-quired people with temporary practice statusto be licensed within 12 months of receiving adegree. The commissioner of the Departmentof Health will no longer be allowed to extend aperson 's temporary practice status. The legislation was sponsored by Rep. Joe Mullery (DFL-Mpls) and Sen. Dallas Sams(DFL-Staples). HF357/SF289*/CH10 Eliminating duplication A new law will prevent a government pro- gram from having to make multiple reports ofthe same information. According to the Minnesota Department of Health, a law passed by the Legislature in 2000required the department 's alcohol and drug counselor licensing program to make dupli-cate reports about its licensing activities. A fact sheet released by the department stated, \"repeal of the redundant reporting require- ments would not affect the Legislature 's over- sight of licensing activities because the sameinformation would be presented in the report submitted by the health licensing boards. \" In addition to deleting one required report- ing, the new law instructs the commissioner todevelop internal operating procedures for shar-ing relevant information and coordinating in-vestigations involving alcohol and drugcounselors. Among those eligible to be included in the receiving of information are state boards, stateagencies, and representatives of other statesregarding disciplinary measures against alco-hol and drug counselors. The law also requires school counselors who provide alcohol and drug counseling servicesto be licensed as either a school counselor or analcohol and drug counselor. The arrangement is intended to assure con- sistency in handling and sharing confidentialand private data while avoiding unnecessarydata reporting. Rep. Bud Nornes (R-Fergus Falls) and Sen. Linda Higgins (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the newlaw, which is effective Aug. 1, 2001. HF1819/SF1430*/CH138 Board of Psychology changes Effective Aug. 1, 2001, a new law changes the guidelines governing disciplinary actions andcomplaints against psychologists in the state. The new law will increase the maximum civil penalty for disciplinary action from $5,000to $7,500. In addition, the state Board of Psy-chology, which oversees the state 's licensed psychologists, may fix the penalty at an amountto recover the state attorney general 's legal, paralegal, and investigative costs or costs of anadministrative law judge to any penalty as-sessed to a practitioner. Along the same lines, the new law allows the board to require a license holder or applicantto reimburse any of those costs resulting froma failure to comply with remedies prescribedby the board or a judge. The new law will also establish a seven-year limitation period for complaints against pro-viders that are received by the board afterJuly 31, 2001. It will prohibit any proceedingsagainst a psychologist unless it begins withinseven years of some portion of the allegedmisconduct. Exceptions to the limitation period involve the following types of complaints: fraud, deceit, or dishonest conduct that af- fects a person 's ability to practice; a conviction, guilty plea, or no-contest plea to49Highlights NEW LAWS2001 a crime that involved dishonesty or fraud; fraud or deceit in the process of obtaining or renewing a license, approving continuingeducation or in an examination; disciplinary action in any jurisdiction, or surrender or voluntary termination of a li-cense or certificate during an investigation;or physical intimacies, including intercourse, with a client or former client.The new law also provides that the limita- tion period, in a case involving a minor, mustnot begin until that minor is 18. The board suggested the changes in order to conform more closely to the provisions forboards governing other health care providers.Rep. Richard Mulder (R-Ivanhoe), Housesponsor of the new law, said the primary pur-pose of the law is to protect citizens againstunqualified psychologists. Sen. Steve Kelley (DFL-Hopkins) sponsored the measure in the Senate. HF1151*/SF1187/CH66 Continuing education requirements Effective Feb. 16, 2001, a new law makes some technical adjustments to the continuingeducation requirements for registered physi-cian assistants in Minnesota. The law repeals a section of previous law that outlines more specific requirements for theassistants. That section required physician as-sistants to obtain 50 hours of continuing edu-cation every two years, with at least two hourson infection control, including bloodbornediseases, such as HIV and hepatitis B. Rep. Richard Mulder (R-Ivanhoe), who sponsored the law in the House, said the infec-tious disease requirement had already beenrepealed for other health professionals. Mulder,a medical doctor, said continuing educationprovides the necessary training without theprovision, so it isn 't necessary. A different portion of state law maintains that physician assistants must obtain at least50 hours of continuing education every twoyears as a condition of registration and re-newal. In addition, that section of law requiresthat the assistants must have taken a nationalcertifying examination every two years. State law also establishes that the continuing education must adhere to the standards of oneof several organizations, including the Ameri-can Osteopathic Association Bureau of Profes-sional Education, the Royal College of Physi-cians and Surgeons of Canada, the AmericanAcademy of Physician Assistants, or organiza-tions with reciprocal arrangements with thephysician recognition award program of the American Medical Association. Sen. Dallas Sams (DFL-Staples) sponsored the Senate measure. HF213/SF201*/CH3 Medical review change A new law effective Aug. 1, 2001 will change the frequency with which physicians must re-view the prescribing activities of physicianassistants. Previously, state law required that physi- cians review all prescribing, dispensing, andadministering of drugs and medical devicesdone by physician assistants on a daily basis.The new law will change the frequency toweekly. According to the measure, sponsored in the House by Rep. Greg Davids (R-Preston), thephysician and physician assistant must have awritten agreement spelling out the process andschedule for the review. Sen. Dallas Sams (DFL-Staples) sponsored the measure in the Senate. HF1160*/SF1127/CH49 Chiropractic changes Effective Aug. 1, 2001, chiropractors in Min- nesota will face some new requirements inorder to obtain a license. Primarily, the new law repeals several sec- tions of state law governing the peer reviewrequirements for chiropractors. However, thenew law protects any data or information ac-quired by the board for peer review purposesthrough Aug. 1. Such information will remainconfidential. In addition, the new law provides a number of exceptions to when chiropractors must belicensed in the state. They include chiroprac-tors licensed in another state, but fulfilling thefollowing duties in Minnesota: consultation; services at a competitive athletic event; duties solely related to research, public health, or education while employed in a scientific,sanitary, or teaching capacity; treating patients who together with the chiro- practor are engaging in outdoor recreationin the state; and a commissioned officer or member of the Armed Forces, U.S. Public Health Service,the Veterans Administration, any federalinstitution or agency while performing thoseofficial duties within the state.Involving disciplinary matters, chiroprac- tors under investigation must appear at sched-uled conferences and hearings, under the newlaw, and must provide patient records uponrequest. If the state Board of Chiropractic Ex-aminers does not have patient consent, thosespecific records can be eliminated. The new law also specifies the board may recoup costs of investigation, administrativehearings, lawyers, witnesses and other courtproceedings in the penalty assessed. The new law also makes other technical changes regarding what kind of school pro-gram a licensed chiropractor must have gradu-ated from. Rep. Jim Abeler (R-Anoka) and Sen. Sheila Kiscaden (R-Rochester) were the sponsors.

The bill contains $176 million in new gen- eral fund spending and nearly $196 millionoverall. Though it does not contain as much asofficials sought, the law includes more than the$99 million recommended by Gov. JesseVentura. Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley) and Sen. Deanna Wiener (DFL-Eagan) sponsoredthe legislation. The following is a look at how specific areas will be affected by the new legislation. All por-tions are effective July 1, 2001. 2001 Special Session HF6/SF11*/CH1 MnSCU funding The law calls for $100 million in new fund- ing, and more than $1.24 billion overall, for theMinnesota State Colleges and Universities.They sought $255.6 million in new spending. Nearly $80 million of the new funding will go toward inflation support, things such assalaries and health care coverage. The remain-der is for academic excellence, instructionaltechnology, and equipment. PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID Money from state tobacco settlement payments will help stabilize funding for the Academic Health Centeron the Twin Cities campus of the University of Minnesota. No funds from the state 's youth anti-smoking campaign will be used as originally proposed.The legislation includes $110,000 for the expansion of the Minnesota Talented YouthProgram at Minnesota State University,Mankato, prohibits the planning or develop-ing of doctoral programs or degrees withoutprior legislative approval, requires that theMinnesota transfer curriculum be imple-mented at MnSCU campuses by Jan. 1, 2002,and requires technical and consolidated col-leges to continue to use instructional advisorycommittees that are consulted on programchanges or discontinuation. It also allocates $5 million in central office reserves to the campuses through a leveragedequipment purchase program that requires bothan equal nonstate match and that the MnSCUboard adopt policies clarifying the purpose ofthe central reserves and when it can be used. Other MnSCU provisions in the law include expanding the authority of the board of trust-ees to acquire or convey facilities under systemcontrol, and requiring the MnSCU board withthe council of presidents to study the methodof delivering services from the central office tomember institutions. The study will assess waysto streamline the process and eliminate dupli-cating of things on campuses and at the centraloffice. (Art. 1, Sec. 3) University of Minnesota Of the nearly $1.3 billion allocated to the University of Minnesota, the law calls for$91 million in new general fund spending.University officials sought $221 million.The funding includes $89.4 million for gen- eral compensation, facilities support, libraries,and enhancing the undergraduate experience.(Art. 1, Sec. 4) The university will also receive about $20 million in tobacco money for its AcademicHealth Center on the Twin Cities campus.University officials said $16 million was neededto stabilize the facility. Funding will come from a separate account in the medical education endowment fundcreated by using tobacco settlement paymentson Jan. 2, 2002 and Jan. 2, 2003. (Art. 2, Sec. 2) The law establishes a Commission on Uni- versity of Minnesota Excellence. The 15 mem-bers will examine the mission, scope, and fi-nancing of the university; propose ways torefocus the mission; and recommend how theuniversity can develop five or more centers ofexcellence that can achieve a top 10 nationalrank in the next decade. (Art. 2, Sec. 28) Accountability measures Both the university and MnSCU are required to complete two reports under the legislation.The first, to be completed by Feb. 1 of even-numbered years, considers allocation of stateappropriations, tuition rates and fees, and howthat relates to leveraging non-state money. A second report, to be completed by Feb. 15, 2002 and each odd-numbered yearthereafter, will measure a number of areas,including:51Highlights NEW LAWS2001 a report on five priority undergraduate programs, reallocations to advance the priorities, baseline data and methods used to measure first generation students, a plan to increase recruitment and retention, and progress in increasing graduations and trans- fers to four-year institutions by race,ethnicity, and gender. (Art. 1, Secs. 3, 4) Financial aid funding The Higher Education Services Office, which serves as the state 's financial aid bureau, will receive $148.7 million in fiscal year 2002 and$157.6 million the following year. Among the changes designed to help stu- dents are: $9.65 million to expand the eligibility for receiving a state grant to a fifth year of school-ing (Art. 2, Sec. 11); Program savings due to an increase in the federal Pell Grant of more than $3,750 are tobe used to decrease the family responsibilityfor independent students up to a maximum20 percent reduction and for work studyprograms (Art. 1, Sec. 2); Exempts certain full-time employees who move to the state from the one-year residency re-quirement for state aid (Art. 2, Sec. 6); and Increases the maximum childcare credit from $2,000 to $2,600 and extends eligibility fromeight to 10 semesters. (Art. 2, Secs. 13, 14)The law also provides for enactment of the Minnesota College Savings Plan. Formerly re-ferred to as Edvest, the plan will allow indi-viduals to save for college in investment ac-counts managed by the state. Under the pro-gram the state will provide a matching grant toeligible Minnesota resident families contrib-uting at least $200 in a year. In the program, families with $80,000 or less in income are eligible to receive up to 15 per-cent (maximum $300) of their annual contri-bution. (Art. 3, Secs. 1-24) A new post-secondary grant program for Minnesota high school students who will attendcollege in the state is also in the law beginning infiscal year 2003. Those who achieve qualifyingscores on a specified number of advanced place-ment or international baccalaureate tests will beeligible for a state-funded grant. The programwill receive $150,000. (Art. 2, Sec. 12) The law also requires the Higher Education Services Office to collect monthly data frominstitutions participating in the state grant pro-gram and to report on its expenditures to thehigher education committee chairs in the Leg-islature and commissioner of finance four timesper year. The goal of this provision is for the office to use all of its allotted funds, and if not,to transfer them to other financial aid pro-grams. It is expected the agency will have morethan $10 million returned to the general fundat the conclusion of fiscal year 2001. In terms of tuition reciprocity, the law re- quires the office, along with representatives fromMnSCU and the university, to negotiate tuitionagreements with North Dakota, South Dakota,and Wisconsin. The goal is to minimize stateobligations with new methods of collaborationaimed at improved access and reduced cost. A progress report on reciprocity must be presented to the 2002 Legislature. Leaders saythis is important given that the state will pay$10.5 million to other states to meet reciproc-ity contract obligations in the next biennium.(Art. 1, Sec. 2) Mayo Medical Foundation The legislation allocates almost $1.64 million annually to the Mayo Medical Foundation. Funding includes $605,000 per year for the Mayo Medical School, via the state paying amaximum of $14,405 each year for each stu-dent who is a state resident. The money is to beused to increase the number of doctors prac-ticing in rural areas where there is a particularneed for doctors. It also appropriates $625,000 annually to increase the limit to 27 residents in the familypractice and graduate residency programs. Finally, the law appropriates $407,000 each year to support 12 resident physicians annu-ally in the St. Cloud Hospital-Mayo FamilyPractice Residency Program. The programprepares doctors to practice primary care inrural areas. (Art. 1, Sec. 5) Collective bargaining units combined Combining the two instructional units at Minnesota State Colleges and Universities forcollective bargaining purposes is now allowed,under a new law effective May 22, 2001. Sponsored by Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley) and Sen. Deanna Wiener (DFL-Eagan),the law allows for the merger of the commu-nity college instructional unit and the techni-cal college instructional unit into a new statecollege instructional unit for MnSCU employ-ees. It also allows for the appointment of anexclusive representative. Leppik said the new law is a logical develop- ment resulting from the MnSCU merger in1994. Both the units agreed to merge in early2001, she said.The collective bargaining agreements of the separate instructional units will continue untilreplaced. Benefits of members will also bemaintained until the merger of the units. Other existing collective bargaining agree- ments not affected by this law include: rein-statement rights to employees who are on anapproved leave of absence, and all dates forseniority, accumulated benefits and otherbenefits. Leppik said the law will help eliminate some turf battles when similar courses are taught bymembers of both unions, but instructors areworking under different contracts in regardsto conditions and compensation.

Joe Mullery (DFL- Mpls), the House sponsor of the legislation.The study is \"so landlords can charge enough to cover their expenses, but tenants won 't have to do huge payouts. \" Landlords charge application fees to cover the costs for obtaining credit history and crimi-nal background checks. But Mullery said prob-lems arise when a homeless person or someonewithout a job attempts to find housing and isfaced with substantial fees. Or, he added, whenlandlords take application fees from prospec-tive renters but then don 't conduct searches.52NEW LAWS2001Highlights A committee will conduct the study, admin- istered by the commissioner of the MinnesotaHousing Finance Agency, and make recom-mendations to the Legislature by Jan. 1, 2002.The committee will consist of one memberfrom each of the major parties from the Houseand Senate, as well as \"members representing landlord and tenant advocacy groups and ten-ant screening companies, \" the law reads. The law also charges the committee with the task of considering various ways to reduce theburden of multiple rental application fees onprospective tenants. The study will have minimal costs, none of which are covered by the law. Sen. Julie [[ll(DFL-Mpls) sponsored the measure in the Senate.

About $7.3 billion of the law 's appropria- tions come from the state 's general fund. Of that figure, $842 million pays for correctionsand other criminal justice expenditures. The biggest chunk of spending funds the Department of Human Services, which consti-tutes about 85 percent of the overall funding.Key in those provisions are extensions for par-ticipants who reach the state 's welfare reform program 's 60-month limit, long-term care funding, medical assistance, and additionalfunding to insure more of the state 's children and families by 2005. In addition, the law creates a felony drunken driving penalty beginning Aug. 1, 2002. Lan-guage affecting the penalty is located in boththis law and the transportation/public safetyfunding law. Appropriations to cover addi-tional costs for the new penalty are also in-cluded in both measures. (See related story,page 74) The law, sponsored by Rep. Kevin Goodno (R-Moorhead) and Sen. Linda Berglin (DFL-Mpls), takes effect July 1, 2001 unless other-wise noted. The following are some of thehighlights. 2001 Special Session: HF3/SF4*/CH9 Welfare sanctions The law allocates $19 million to extend ben- efits for nearly 52 percent of families that areexpected to reach the 60-month limit for ben-efits from the Minnesota Family InvestmentProgram (MFIP) \u2014 the state 's welfare reform assistance program. The plan will extend benefits to participants who meet the following requirements: one-parent family \u201430 hours of work activ- ity, of which 25 hours must be spent inemployment; or two-parent family \u2014 55 hours of work activ- ity, of which 45 hours must be spent inemployment. they must be in compliance for at least 10 of the 12 months before the month they reachthe 60-month limit. if loss of employment was involuntary, the participant can be exempt from the hourlyrequirements for one month. This exemp- tion is only available twice in a year.In addition, extensions will be made available for certain hardships and hard-to-employ indi-viduals, while funding is provided for legal non-citizens. The law provides a hard sunset forextensions at June 30, 2004. (Art. 10, Sec. 28) Recipients must be notified that they are reaching the 60-month limit at least 12 monthsprior. (Art. 10, Sec. 23) Counties may also modify their own criteria for sanctions annually effective March 1, 2002,by implementing those included in statute fora sixth or subsequent offense. (Art. 10, Sec. 33) Another provision requires the commissioner of human services to establish a demonstrationproject to determine whether pre-pregnancyfamily planning services reduces medical assis-tance and MFIP costs. (Art. 2, Sec. 55) Children 's health The law allocates about $4.4 million for a plan that provides health insurance coveragefor more children and more adults at a fractionof the cost of the governor 's proposal. The governor suggested extending coverage to more children, while simultaneously reduc-ing coverage for the adult population, at a costof $11.9 million for the biennium. The goal, Goodno said, is to provide insur- ance coverage for 20,000 children under age 19by fiscal year 2005. Beginning July 1, 2002,income limits for benefits are at 100 percent offederal poverty guidelines for parents, and170 percent of guidelines for children to re-ceive medical assistance. (Art. 2, Secs. 24, 25) The federal poverty limit for annual income The omnibus health, human services, and corrections law allocates about $4.4 million for a plan thatprovides access to health insurance coverage for more children and adults.PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID53Highlights NEW LAWS2001 in 2001 for a family of four was $17,652. Also, a bridge plan allows children not eli- gible for medical assistance with incomes un-der 217 percent of federal poverty guidelines,to be covered under the MinnesotaCare pro-gram without paying premiums for the first12 months. (Art. 2, Sec. 65) Long-term care The Legislature appropriated $131 million more for long-term care reform in the 2002-03biennium. Of that figure, $108 million willprovide rate increases for the industry. There are also a number of policy provisions for long-term and continuing care in the law,designed to help encourage more home- andcommunity-based options for Minnesotans,rather than only having the choice of nursinghome care. For example, one section requires that people who may ultimately require nursing home orhospital care be informed of home-based op-tions available and must be given the choicesallowable by law. (Art. 3, Sec. 59) Increased spending will be offset by a pro- posal to downsize the nursing home industryup to 5,140 beds during the biennium, a de-crease in overall nursing home capacity ofmore than 10 percent. The reduction will savethe state 's general fund $44 million. Built into that funding are several provi- sions to add flexibility to the state 's long-term care system. New money was also provided forregional planning and development,community resource development grants, and several items that encourage employees to en-ter the long-term care field. (Art. 4, Sec. 32) The law increases to $1 million the dollar threshold above which nursing home con-struction projects need approval under themoratorium exception process. Improvementswill now also include technological items. Pre-vious law set the limit at $750,000, plus adjust-ments for inflation. Exceptions are made forrelocating or repairing a facility that was some-how damaged. It must only be for the purposeof replacing already existing beds, however.(Art. 5, Sec. 3-7) In both 2002 and 2003, nursing homes and community-based providers will get 3 percentcost-of-living increases, while the operators ofintermediate care facilities for people withmental retardation and day training and ha-bilitation services will receive 3.5 percent. (Art. 5, Secs. 17, 30, 37) The law requires that about two-thirds of the increase be dedicated to wages, benefits,and other personnel costs. As a result, institu-tions must develop a plan to explain how thatwill be accomplished, so officials can be surethe money is going where it was intended,Berglin said. (Art. 5, Sec. 20) Nursing facilities with low rates will receive additional rate increases, and all facilities willreceive higher initial rates for new admissions.About half of this increase must be used forwages, benefits and other personnel costs. (Art. 5, Secs. 18, 19)Ventura only recommended a 2 percent in- crease in 2003 because of previous increasesgranted by the Legislature but not recom-mended by the administration. The law establishes a demonstration project that provides grants for consumer-directedhome care services for patients receiving medi-cal assistance. The intent is for consumers tohave more control and accountability over theavailable resources. In addition, it will allowthem to choose home-care services in a moreindividualized, cost-effective manner. (Art. 3,Sec. 37) Telehomecare services will also be covered by medical assistance in instances where spe-cific, hands-on treatment is not necessary. Theservices require certain technology and mustalso meet certain requirements to be consid-ered a visit in order to ensure a certain level ofcare. (Art. 3, Sec. 38) In an effort to better inform aging Minneso- tans of the health and home care options avail-able, the Board on Aging must establish aSenior LinkAge Line, operated during busi-ness hours through a statewide toll-free num-ber and via the Internet. The line will helpadults, caregivers, and providers find informa-tion about both public and private long-termcare services. (Art. 4, Sec. 2) In addition, the law modifies the pre-admis- sion screening program and renames it thelong-term care consultation services program.The intent of the initiative is to help peopleassess their options and meet their long-termcare needs, even if those require a nursinghome stay. (Art. 4, Sec. 4) Eliminating health disparities The law contains about $10 million to elimi- nate existing health disparities between whiteand racial and ethnic populations in the state. Specifically, the law 's goal is to cut dispari- ties amongst American Indians and popula-tions of color in half by 2010. Specifically, theprograms should address the following issues: infant mortality, adult and child immunization rates, breast and cervical cancer screening, HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and accidental injuries and violence. The law establishes criteria for various com- munity grant programs to accomplish this goal.Grant funds may not supplant existing bud-gets for county or tribal services. The commissioner is also required to use PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID In both 2002 and 2003, nursing homes and long-term care facilities will receive 3 percent cost-of-livingincreases, while operators of intermediate care facilities for people with mental retardation and day trainingand habilitation services will receive 3.5 percent, under the health and human services funding law.54NEW LAWS2001Highlights and enhance existing data tools to measure risk behaviors associated with health disparities.(Art. 1, Sec. 48) Prescription drug benefits The law expands eligibility for the state 's prescriptions drug program for the secondyear in a row. Seniors with incomes of up to 135 percent of federal poverty guidelines will now be eligiblefor the pharmacy program on Jan. 1, 2002.People with disabilities, whose income is lessthan 120 percent of federal poverty guidelines,will be eligible for the pharmacy program onJuly 1, 2002. (Art. 2, Sec. 7) Under current law, seniors are eligible at 120 percent and the disabled at 100 percent ofpoverty guidelines. In addition, the commissioner is authorized to collect medical assistance for drugs distrib-uted in an outpatient setting from manufac-turers who have signed a federal rebateagreement. (Art. 2, Sec. 6) Immunizations The law allows some changes to the state 's immunization schedule with certain guide-lines. It also adjusts some of the exemptionprocedures to enhance the informationavailable. Language in the law amends state statute regarding notification procedures for exemp-tions from immunizations that are available.The language requires the information to beeasily readable and understandable. PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID Funding in the omnibus health, human services, and corrections law will help eliminate health disparitiesbetween white and minority communities in Minnesota. In addition, before performing any immu- nizations, the provider must furnish the fol-lowing information in writing: a list of immunizations required for a school or childcare facility, a description of the permitted exemptions, a list of additional immunizations recom- mended by the commissioner of health, and a copy of vaccine information sheet that details possible adverse reactions. (Art. 1, Sec. 25)As for modifying the schedule, the commis- sioner of health may do so by rule, after con-sulting with certain other officials in the stateand following recommendations of certain fed- eral health agencies and organizations. In addition, the commissioner must notify the chairs of the House and Senate committeeswith oversight of health policy prior to adopt-ing the notification. If they desire to hold apublic hearing, they may do so within 60 daysof receiving notice. Administrative law guidelines will still govern schedule modifications, as well, which wouldallow for citizen input and hearings before ajudge, if necessary. (Art. 1, Secs. 26, 27) Health care careers, increased access Several portions of the law are intended to encourage individuals to pursue health care-related professions and extend benefits tounderserved populations, under specificcriteria. The Minnesota Job Skills Partnership board will provide grants of up to $400,000 each toqualifying consortia that operate local, regional,or statewide training and retention programs.Several funding sources for the grants, includ-ing Temporary Assistance for Needy Familiesfunds, will be available. Grants do require alocal match. (Art. 6, Sec. 2) Nursing facilities will also be eligible for per diem scholarship reimbursements for employ-ees who pursue interpreter and English as aSecond Language training. (Art. 6, Sec. 6) Another provision allows the Health Department to make grants to encouragemiddle and high school students to work andvolunteer in health care and long-term caresettings. (Art. 1, Sec. 33) PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID The state Department of Health may make changes to the state 's immunization schedule while the Legislature is not in sessionunder certain guidelines, as prescribed in the omnibus health, human services, and correctionslaw. It also adjusts some of the exemption procedures to enhance the information available.55Highlights NEW LAWS2001 A demonstration project will be established for dental services in Crow Wing, Todd,Morrison, Wadena, and Cass counties. Theproject will involve providing services to medi-cal assistance, general assistance medical care,and MinnesotaCare participants. (Art. 2,Sec. 51) Grants will be made available to teaching institutions and clinical training sties forprojects that increase dental access forunderserved populations. (Art. 2, Sec. 3) In addition, retired dentists will be reim- bursed through a new program for license feesand insurance in exchange for providing100 hours of volunteer dental services within a12-month period. The Department of HumanServices will also develop a program, wherebya dental practice may be donated to a chari-table organization. (Art. 2, Secs. 10, 11) Grants will also be available to communities that demonstrate effective ways of providingdental services to public program participants.(Art. 2, Sec. 47) Loan forgiveness programs Dental students can enroll in a loan forgive- ness program. To be eligible, they must sign acontract for a three-year service obligation, inwhich they serve a certain percentage of pa-tients enrolled in state public programs. Up to14 people per year may be granted forgiveness,under the program. (Art. 1, Sec. 34) Mental health and civil commitment Certain mental health requirements are pro- vided in the law. Health plans must provide coverage for cer- tain anti-psychotic drugs, intended to treatemotional disturbance or mental illness re-gardless of whether they are part of the plan 's drug formulary. (Art. 9, Sec. 2) In addition,health plans covering mental health servicesmust also cover those ordered by a court.(Art. 9, Sec. 3) Suicide prevention measures are also included in the law, many of which were originally spon-sored by Rep. Fran Bradley (R-Rochester). Thelaw allocates $1.1 million each year of the bien-nium for this purpose. (Art. 17, Sec. 3) The commissioner may develop such a plan using an \"evidence-based, public health ap- proach focused on prevention. \" The law re- quires the commissioner to develop grant pro-grams for community-based programs andworkplace and employee assistance programs. In addition, the law requires data collection and analysis for the purpose of issuing a publicreport on Minnesota-specific suicide andsuicidal behaviors. (Art. 1, Sec. 45) The new law includes language that changes civil commitment procedures to give familiesmore flexibility. Specifically, it changes thedefinition of a mentally ill person (Art. 9,Sec. 22), and allows a person or agency actingon the behalf of a mentally ill person to petitionthe court for admission to a treatment facility.(Art. 9, Sec. 27) All the patients ' rights are also described and protected, under the law. Finally, the law provides that certain con- tinuing care and rehabilitative mental healthservices will be covered under the state 's medi- cal assistance plan. (Art. 9, Secs. 38 and 39) Many of the civil commitment provisions were initially sponsored in the House byRep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville). Alternative autism therapies The law provides $557,000 in medical assis- tance money for alternative therapies for chil-dren with autism, beginning Jan. 1, 2003. The therapies are intended to improve a child 's behavioral functioning, to prevent the development of challenging behaviors and toeliminate behaviors. Ultimately, the therapiesshould help a child maintain a certain amountof independence and be able to speak andinteract socially. The law lays out eligibility criteria relating to behavior, IQ, and health. It also states thatservices covered must be performed under asingle supervisor and clinical plan and must beperformed according to behavioral research. A study is also required. Provisions similarto those in the law were originally sponsored by Rep. Dan Larson (DFL-Bloomington).(Art. 2, Sec. 31) Health studies, other provisions The Department of Health must perform a number of different studies, under the law. One will review various factors that influ- ence patient care and safety including staffinglevels. (Art. 1, Sec. 59) Another will examine how a shortage in the health care workforce affects costs. (Art. 1,Sec. 60) The commissioner will also study how stu- dent medications must be dispensed in schooland whether any statutory changes need to bemade. (Art. 1, Sec. 61) The law also authorizes intergovernmental transfers to certain hospitals in the state con-sidered safety net hospitals or those that showhigher medical assistance costs and providehigh levels of charity care. Those hospitals are Hennepin County Medi- cal Center and Fairview University MedicalCenter in Minneapolis, and Regions Hospitalin St. Paul. Payments are also authorized for rural hos- pital capital improvement grants, under thelaw, which allocates $5.4 million for thebiennium. (Art. 2, Sec. 46) Felony DWI The law will create a felony drunken driving penalty, making a person 's fourth conviction within 10 years a felony beginning Aug. 1, 2002. The language is a result of much PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID Provisions in the omnibus health, human services, and corrections law expands the eligibility for thestate 's prescription drug program for seniors and persons with disabilities.56NEW LAWS2001Highlights deliberation over the course of the 2000 and 2001 sessions, including an interim task forceto examine the feasibility and costs of such apenalty. Key among legislators ' concerns was the cost that would be associated with such a pen-alty \u2014 both to state and local governments. Included in the law is about $2.6 million in funding for felony DWI. Particularly, themoney will go to the Public Defense Board, tothe state attorney general for felony appeals,and the Department of Corrections for proba-tion officers to handle the new felons. The large share of that money, $2.1 million, goes to the Corrections Department for thepotential bed impact involved with the newfelony penalty. (Art. 18, Sec. 3) Corrections The Department of Corrections will receive about $735 million over the biennium. Keycorrections initiatives involve funding for pro-bation officers. (Art. 18, Sec. 3) There are three ways that probation servicesExpanding admittance A new law will smooth the way for people whose health needs may be best served in anadult foster care facility, but their age may havepreviously disqualified from admittance to sucha facility. The law is effective March 1, 2001.Sponsored in the House by Rep. Stephen Wenzel (DFL-Little Falls), the new law willchange the capacity requirements for adultfoster care by lowering the age base from 60 to55 for facilities that provide service to fivepeople. The population this law will affect are able to function in a residential, home-like setting andare not in need of the high level of care pro-vided in a nursing home. By lowering the age requirements for people in adult foster care, the new law makes themeligible for such a facility. It will also allow the commissioner of hu- man services to grant variances for peopleyounger than age 55 to be admitted to five-bedfoster care homes when recommended by thecounty in which the facility is located, as longas other requirements are met. Similarly, it will permit a licensed adult fos- ter care provider to also provide adult day careto people age 55 or older, and it will allow thecommissioner to grant variance to providersto admit up to seven people for those services. Officials raised the issue dealt with in the law on behalf of a person with multiple sclerosis inan effort to give people who suffer from thatdisease better access to health care serviceswhile avoiding placement in a nursing home.During the early months of 2001, about 360people under age 65 with the disease wereliving in a state nursing home. The Senate measure was sponsored by Sen. Don Samuelson (DFL-Brainerd). HF181/SF43*/CH4 are provided in a result,CCA counties arereimbursed for aportion of theircosts by the state. Of the remain- ing, 26 counties re-ceive probation ser-vices from the De-partment of Cor-rections and 30counties rely on thestate for probationservices for adultfelons only. Under the bill, all three areas will seean increase in basefunding for the bi-ennium. CCAcounties portionwill go $15 for the biennium, and nearly $1 million inincreased funding will go to non-CCA coun-ties. Counties providing their own probationservices will be reimbursed for half of theircosts, said Rep. John Tuma (R-Northfield),with nearly $2 million extra funding in the bill. In addition, the bill includes $3.7 million for increased treatment and supervision of sexoffenders. The goal of the new funding is to reduce caseloads for probation officers. The increaseswere not included in the governor 's budget. The law provides full funding for the Om- budsman for Corrections at $659 million forthe biennium, though an original proposaleliminated the office. However, the law doesrequire a study of the office, including feasibil-ity and effects of privatizing some of theservices. (Art. 18, Sec. 21)Salary, benefits, legal services Salary and benefit increases are provided for the State Public Defender 's Office, the Board of Public Defense, the District Public Defense,and Corrections Department in the bill. Public Defense Corporations will continue to receive previous base funding amounts, whichhelp provide legal aid and consultation to vari-ous groups of people throughout the state. Thecorporations will also receive $325,000 extraover the biennium. The House originally pro-vided no extra funding and the Senate providedabout $450,000.

Under a new law, the Department of Hu- man Services will be allowed to establish sys-tems and records for the purpose of perform-ing background checks on licensees. Such background checks would be allowed when statute authorizes one or the individualgives his or her consent to the check. Guardians and conservators are appointed to care for the needs of an incapacitated person,such as a vulnerable adult, or that person's es-tate. The new law will also amend the definitionof a professional guardian or conservator togovern someone serving two or more wards notrelated to them by either blood or marriage. The new law provides that before a court can appoint a professional conservator or guard-ian, a background study including a criminalhistory check must be performed unless onehas been performed within the last five years.The law also requires background checks everyfive years after appointment. Criminal historychecks for non-professionals can be required ifin the court's discretion. If a professional guardian is not an indi- vidual, then all people who will be responsiblefor providing guardianship must undergo abackground study, under the law. All guardians, professional or otherwise, will be checked for substantial claims of vulnerableadult maltreatment. Rep. Jim Knoblach (R-St. Cloud), House sponsor of the law, said the idea was originallybrought to him by a patient at the VeteransAdministration Hospital in St. Cloud. He saidthe patient had acquired a fairly large estate,but while being treated in the hospital over thecourse of about five years, much of that estatewas taken in fees to manage the estate. The constituent suggested he could have saved a great deal had he chosen a bank trustcompany to perform the job. He also suggestedthat background checks could help providemore information about groups performingconservator and guardian services, Knoblachsaid. The Department of Human Services ap- pointed a task force to examine the issue andthe law resulted from that effort. Sen. Dave Kleis (R-St. Cloud) sponsored the Senate version. HF440/SF321*/CH163Rights, responsibilities clarified A new law effective Aug. 1, 2001 will include social workers in a list of specified health pro-fessionals required by law to notify individualsof a specific threat of violence by a client againstan identified individual. The \"duty to warn\" provisions were created in 1986 to specify that particular professionals havea duty to predict, warn of, or take reasonableprecautions to provide protection from specificthreats made by a client against a particularindividual. Such professionals are required tocontact the law enforcement agency nearest thepotential victim or client. Social workers willnow be among those professionals. The law specifies that professionals gov- erned by the law cannot be held liable, nor canthey be sanctioned by a licensing board, forfailing to discharge this duty. Additionally, thelaw does not require social workers or anyother professional to disclose threats madeagainst oneself. The new law also places social workers into a group of professionals who are authorized tocreate professional organizations. Other suchprofessionals include doctors, practitioners ofchiropractic, nurses, psychologists, optom-etrists, dentists, pharmacists, and podiatrists. Social workers were inadvertently left out when the law was revised previously. Sponsorswanted to make sure the protections providedin law were also available to them. The law was sponsored Rep. Tim Mahoney (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen. John Marty (DFL-Roseville).

The law, sponsored by Sen. Linda Higgins (DFL-Mpls) and Rep. Neva Walker (DFL-Mpls), will expand the size of the council fromits current 11 members to 13 members. Underthe measure, the additional seats will be filledby one person whose ethnic heritage is fromWest Africa, and one member whose ethnicheritage is from East Africa.The new law will define East Africa as the areas occupied by Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda,Tanzania, Uganda, and Somalia. West Africa, under the law, will encompass Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Coted'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, BurkinaFaso, and those parts of Mali and Niger southof the Sahara. The Council on Black Minnesotans was es- tablished in 1980 to advise the governor andLegislature on issues facing African-Ameri-cans in the state. The council is also chargedwith recommending changes to laws to helpaddress those issues. Walker said the number of immigrants from Africa to Minnesota is increasing, and that byrequiring representatives from West Africa andEast Africa to serve on the council, issues cru-cial to those communities would be betteraddressed.

The law, which is effective retroactive to Aug. 1, 2000, allows the 30 LTV miners laid offat that time to collect an extra 26 weeks ofunemployment benefits when regular benefitsexpire. More than 1,300 additional workers ofthe Hoyt Lakes plant were laid off when thecompany went bankrupt in February 2001. Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) spon- sored the measure in the House. Sen. DougJohnson (DFL-Tower) sponsored the Senateversion. However, the law received significantsupport in both bodies beyond its sponsors. \"Those 900 people on unemployment ben- efits are making decisions about how to puttheir lives back together for themselves andtheir families,\" said Rep. Tom Bakk (DFL-Cook). The former LTV workers are also moving into new careers, and Bakk said in rural Min-nesota one can't go down the street and findanother job \u2014 especially on the Iron Range. The new law reflects positions taken in both the House and the Senate, drawn together in58NEW LAWS2001Highlights conference committee. The original House plan granted an extra 13 weeks of unemploymentcompensation for those laid off last August.The Senate version of the measure called for 30weeks of unemployment compensation for allformer LTV workers \u2014 including those af- fected by both the August and Februarylayoffs. Under the new law, the former workers are eligible for 26 weeks of compensation in a 95-week window of time. This allows workers tobe employed in temporary positions such assummer construction. To receive benefits, applicants must be en- rolled in an education or job-training pro-gram. The 95-week period extends throughthe end of the 2001-02 school year, allowingtime for applicants to complete any trainingprograms while still receiving benefits. The new law also extends the time a mining plant must be kept in operating condition inMinnesota from one year to two years, toprovide more time to find a buyer for thefacility. HF47*/SF39/CH30 PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID Miners who were laid off when the LTV Steel Mining Co. shut down its Hoyt Lakes facility in February 2001 were able to receive an extra 26 weeks of unemployment benefits, under a 2001 new law. Mining property acquisition The commissioner of the Iron Range Re- sources and Rehabilitation Board (IRRRB) willnow have extra assurances of acquiring landsand facilities of mines that have closed, undera new law signed by the governor. The new law, sponsored by Rep. TomRukavina (DFL-Virginia) and Sen. David Tomassoni (DFL-Chisholm), was promptedby the commissioner of the board. Effective Aug. 1, 2001, the law will be appli- cable to LTV Steel Mining Company proper-ties. The Hoyt Lakes plant closed in January2001 after the company filed bankruptcy. Previous law allowed the commissioner to use eminent domain if they needed to acquireproperty to meet economic development goals,Rukavina said. But the commissioner wantedreassurance that he could acquire \"any or all of the mine lands and related facilities, \" as the law reads. The underlying fact in this case, Rukavinasaid, was \"that LTV had declared bankruptcy and they own a lot of land that is now beingused for public purposes. \" For example, LTV owns the land that the Hoyt Lakes golf course and the city 's baseball fields sit on, as well as a dam that controls thewater level of the lakes that surround HoytLakes. Eminent domain, sometimes called condem- nation, is the legal process by which a publicbody and certain quasi-public bodies (such asutility companies and railroads) are given legalpower to acquire private property for a specificpublic purpose. State law or the state constitu-tion must sanction that public purpose. \"We didn 't want a land developer from out east to buy up this property and then hold thecity hostage \u2014 or worse yet, sell the land, \" Rukavina said. \"We also wanted to try and keep the mines ' assets together, like the powerplant, railroad and loading docks, so this (law) gives us that option. \" HF1105/SF960*/CH149 'Illegal' steel dumping resolution The Legislature and Gov. Jesse Ventura sent a message to President George W. Bush re-questing that the president 's administration immediately investigate steel product importsto the United States. The measure, sponsored in the House by Rep. Tony Sertich (DFL-Chisholm), maintainsthat the \"absorption of a disproportionate share of diverted steel trade ... ultimately (has) adetrimental effect on this state 's economy. \" Sponsors decried the practice called \"illegal dumping, \" which constitutes other countries exporting their excess steel into the UnitedStates and selling it at a lower price than Ameri-can manufacturers. Officials say such imports of steel products have been the cause of more than 7,000 joblosses for steelworkers across the nation in thelast six months, including 1,500 in Minnesota. The resolution implores Bush \"to immedi- ately impose a one-year ban on imports of allsteel products that are the products of, or aremanufactured in, Australia, China, South Af-rica, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, India,Japan, Russia, South Korea, Mexico, or Brazilif the president finds that the governments ofthose countries are not abiding by the spiritand letter of international trade agreements59Highlights NEW LAWS2001 with respect to imports of steel products into the United States. \" Sen.

The measure aims to protectsmall, independently owned gas stations from large retailers engaging in predatory pricing.No gas below cost Gas retailers will be restricted from selling gas below cost, under a new law effective Aug.1, 2001. The measure aims to protect small,independently owned gas stations from largeretailers engaging in predatory pricing. The law was sponsored in the House by Rep. Greg Davids (R-Preston) and in the Senate bySen. Steve Murphy (DFL-Red Wing). The new law defines cost as the average terminal price, plus state and federal taxes,plus either 6 percent or eight cents, whicheveris less. This minimum price requirement pro-hibits certain retailers from possibly drivingothers out of business by engaging in preda-tory pricing, which is when major companiesdrop their prices below what their smallercompetitors can afford. Supporters suggest that without the law, the long-term effect would be to reduce small com-petition and create an environment where largecompanies will be the only voice in setting gasprices. With the law, small retailers will have abetter chance of staying in business,supporters say. To allow special offers, the new law permitsretailers to sell gas below cost as part of promo- tions for three days in a three-month period. HF1007/SF970*/CH129 Gas station franchisee rights The sunset date for a provision that allows gas station owners additional rights to the landthey occupy is extended, under a new laweffective April 27, 2001. Under the law, the expiration date of May 5, 2001 will now be July 1, 2002. The measure wassponsored in the House by Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin). The first time franchisors were required to give franchisees an opportunity to purchasetheir stations was during 2000. Often, gas stations are operated by franchi- sees who lease, rather than own, their loca-tions, and the law passed in 2000 required thatbefore the franchisor who owned the propertycould sell it to a new franchisor, the operator ofthe station had to be given an opportunity topurchase it. The new law continues to provide a sunset date instead of incorporating the provisioninto permanent law due to controversy be-tween franchisors and franchisees over theamount of flexibility each can retain, accord-ing to Haas. Sen. John Hottinger (DFL-Mankato) car- ried the legislation in the Senate.

Minnesota residents who have no-fault au- tomobile insurance are covered for loss ofwage or other labor income if the insuredperson becomes disabled in an auto accident.This coverage is now mandatory, except forpeople over age 65 who have no wage or otherlabor income. Existing law permits people over 65 to de- cline no-fault coverage for income loss as partof their auto insurance. Under the new law,seniors will have an unconditional right todecline the no-fault coverage for income loss.It will also require insurance companies tonotify seniors of this right, at the first issuanceor renewal after age 65 and annually thereafter. Under existing law, the person must have coverage unless the person \"will not reason- ably be expected to be able to receive \" benefits from the coverage, as determined as a result ofinquiry by the insurance company. A request by the insured not to have this coverage will remain in effect until revoked bythe insured. The law is sponsored by Rep. Greg Davids (R-Preston) and Sen. Linda Scheid (DFL-Brooklyn Park). HF694/SF1264*/CH124 Shadow contracting provisions Effective Aug. 1, 2001, a new law will change the consent requirements for providers ofhealth care insurance. The new law builds on a 2000 law that made changes to the insurance practice of \"network shadow contracting, \" which describes a situa- tion when a health care provider enters into anagreement with an insurance company for a60NEW LAWS2001Highlights particular service, only to find out later that the agreement binds the care provider to otherservices offered by the insurance company. Inaddition, those unanticipated services are of-ten at lower reimbursement rates than wouldbe offered through separate agreements forthose services. In 2000, the Legislature expanded references to health care provider, so that such a referencein law included all dentists and hospitals regu-lated by the state. The new law will change the way health care providers alter the categories of coverage inwhich they partake. The law will require pro-viders to affirmatively consent to participate ina category of coverage. Previously, as long asthey didn 't decline, the providers were consid- ered part of a new category. Now, the provider must positively accept to participate in a new category within 60 days. In addition, the new law requires that any amendments to an existing contract betweenan insurance network organization and a pro-vider be clearly discernable and be communi-cated to the provider. Furthermore, under thenew law, if the contact changes how costs arereimbursed or how performance is evaluated,those changes must be disclosed and acceptedbefore the amendment is deemed effective. The final provision of the new law, effective May 25, 2001, will create a task force on smallbusiness health insurance. The task force willbe charged with studying the health care cov-erage market available to small businesses anddetermine ways to make insurance more ac-cessible and affordable. Rep. Jim Abeler (R-Anoka), who sponsored the measure in the House, said many healthproviders have encountered substantial bur-dens \u2014 involving both paperwork and reim- bursement \u2014 as a result of unintended enroll- ment in these network plans. Sen. Dallas Sams (DFL-Staples) sponsored the Senate version. HF1155*/SF1081/CH170 Health insurance changes Gov. Jesse Ventura signed an insurance law that makes technical changes to laws regulat-ing several types of insurance, many of whichhave risen from specific incidences. Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin) and Sen. Linda Scheid (DFL-Brooklyn Park) sponsored thelaw on behalf of the state Department ofCommerce. Listed here are a few of the changes in the new law.Effective Aug. 1, 2001, claims administra- tors for insurance companies will now be re-quired to promptly notify the patient and healthcare provider when health care service is de-nied due to lack of coverage for the service.Previously, the law stated no time limit. Under the new law, insurance companies offering Medicare supplemental coverage aregiven more flexibility to experiment with dif-ferent coverage for prescription drugs. Thecommissioner of the department will have theauthority to waive any requirements dictatedby state law or rule if necessary, except guaran-teed issue, for an experimental project. Thisprovision is also effective Aug. 1, 2001. Under guaranteed issue, a health carrier can- not decline an application from any eligibleemployee or eligible dependent. This require-ment is subject to a health carrier 's right to impose pre-existing condition limitations per-mitted under law. Previously, employers were the only ones required to provide information about con-tinuation of coverage, which is when a personleaves a job but continues on the company 's insurance plan, paying the premium in full.Effective Aug. 1, 2001, the information mustbe provided by the insurer when requested byan employee, their spouses or dependent chil-dren, or, in divorce situations, their formerspouses or dependent children. Self-insured local government employee health plans will now require certification withthe Department of Commerce, under the newlaw. The provision is also effectiveAug. 1, 2001. HF1338/SF1054*/CH215 Bloodborne pathogen tests A new law makes technical changes to pro- visions regulating the use of human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) and bloodborne patho-gen tests. Previously, insurance companies were pro- hibited from obtaining the results of an HIV orbloodborne pathogen test performed on con-victed criminals and their victims when con-sidering a later application for coverage by avictim. Under the new law, insurers can obtainthe results, but are still restricted regardinghow those tests can be used. The new law, effective Aug. 1, 2001, will take away some protections previously in statutethat said any answer that didn 't mention the test was a \"truthful answer \" when an applicant for insurance was asked about HIV orbloodborne pathogen testing. Previous lawmade it illegal for insurers to inquire about such tests. Rep. Kevin Goodno (R-Moorhead) and Sen. John Hottinger (DFL-Mankato) sponsored thelaw. HF1951/SF1204*/CH28 Reciprocal agent licensing law A new law effective July 1, 2002 will comply with a reciprocal law requested by the federalgovernment regarding insurance agents. Minnesota 's new law models provisions rec- ommended by the National Association ofInsurance Commissioners. If at least 20 statesdo not comply with the provisions by passinglaw by November 2002, the federal govern-ment has indicated it will set up a federallicensing system. Many states are creating leg-islation to adhere to the federal government 's request. One provision in the new law changes the term \"insurance agent \" to \"insurance pro- ducer, \" by request of insurance companies. The law, which does not make major changes in regulation of insurance producers, is in-tended to reduce barriers for producers doingbusiness in states other than where they live byeliminating special requirements that apply tonon-resident agents. Under the new law, nonresidents can obtain a nonresident license without taking coursesor an examination, if that resident 's state re- ciprocates for Minnesota residents. Also, un-der certain conditions, a person who has beenlicensed in another state can get a license inMinnesota without new training or testing. The law was sponsored by Rep. Greg Davids (R-Preston) and Sen. Edward Oliver (R-Deephaven). HF1955/SF1826*/CH117 Health care extension Effective May 15, 2001, a new law will allow retired state employees to purchase group long-term care insurance through the same planoffered to active state employees. The new law, which was an initiative of the governor 's office, has no fiscal impact to the state because the coverage is paid for by theenrollees. In May 2000, a long-term care task force convened to address the emerging issues re-garding long-term care in the state. The taskforce members included six senators and sixrepresentatives. Members also involved thecommissioners of the Department of HumanServices, Minnesota Department of Health andthe Minnesota Health Finance Agency.61Highlights NEW LAWS2001 The initial enrollment in the state 's long- term care insurance program that began in thefall of 2000 was more than 11,000 people.Seventy-five percent of those were employees,22 percent spouses, and 3 percent parents ofemployees. The new law allows people who at the time of separation from state employment wereeligible to purchase the coverage to participatein the program. Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin) and Sen. John Hottinger (DFL-Mankato) sponsored themeasure. HF1657/SF1404*/CH94 State fund mutual company The State Fund Mutual Insurance Company \u2014 a public nonprofit corporation founded by the 1983 Minnesota Legislature \u2014 will now exist as a private sector mutual insurance com-pany, under a new law. Effective Aug. 1, 2001, the law will discon- tinue all involvement the company has withthe state, which was primarily in the form of itsboard of directors, with four of its seven mem-bers appointed by the governor. The company,which will remain a nonprofit, no longer feelsstate involvement is needed, according to non-partisan House Research. The company helps Minnesota employers control workers ' compensation costs by offer- ing various insurance products, and by pro-viding loss prevention and educational ser-vices, according to its Web site. Originally, thecompany was intended to serve as a bench-mark for the private sector. The law was sponsored by Rep. Bob Gunther (R-Fairmont) and Sen. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope). HF1219*/SF1678/CH63 Boxing, HMO modifications (See Health, page 46) Utilization review provisions (See Health, page 47) LAW# Getting back gas money A new law will create a civil liability for receiving motor fuel without paying. Beginning Aug. 1, 2001, service station own- ers may impose a $20 service charge, or actualcost of collection, not to exceed $30, as a civilpenalty on owners who fill up their vehicles Gas station owners may now obtain civil penaltiesfrom drivers who leave without paying for gas,under a new law. Retailers are now allowed torecover the cost of the fuel and tack on a servicecharge of up to $20.PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID with gasoline and fail to pay. The gas stationowner can sue for $100, or the price of theoriginal gas plus the service charge, if paymentis not received 30 days after mailing a notice tothe owner of the vehicle. Under the new law, the retailer will send a notice of nonpayment to the owner, supportedby an affidavit of service, to the address indi-cated by records on the vehicle. Such notice must include a signed statement by the em-ployee who witnessed the drive-off and thelicense number of the vehicle. If within the 30-day period the owner sends written notice to the retailer disputing theclaim, the retailer may collect the price of themotor fuel and the civil penalties only througha court judgment, under the new law. Rep. Bud Nornes (R-Fergus Falls) spon- sored the measure in the House. He said ser-vice station owners were suffering an increasein drive-offs. When someone drives off with-out paying, he explained, owners bear not onlythe cost of the fuel, but also gas taxes. Sen. Cal Larson (R-Fergus Falls) sponsored the measure in the Senate. The new law also modifies liability for the issuance of worthless checks. It requires adisplayed notice to include a provision notify- ing a bad check issuer that civil penalties maybe imposed for nonpayment, and requires acourt to consider the amount of the check andthe reason for nonpayment in determining theamount of the penalty. HF205/SF103*/CH204 Peace officer licensing standards A new law will prescribe new grounds for revoking, suspending or denying a peaceofficer 's license. The law effective Aug. 1, 2001, allows the state Board of Peace Officer Standards andTraining to refuse to issue, renew, or reinstatea peace officer license for fraud on the part ofan applicant, failure to meet licensure require-ments, or a violation of the standards of peaceofficer conduct. House sponsor, Rep. Debra Hilstrom (DFL- Brooklyn Center), said that prior to the legalchange, the POST board had to wait until a peaceofficer reapplied for licensure before suspendingor revoking. The new law allows the board totake action against licensees as soon as the boardis made aware of any violation. Furthermore, the new law will allow the board to suspend or revoke a peace officerlicense after a licensee has been convicted of acrime designated by the board as a disqualify-ing offense. The new law will also change the require- ment that the POST Board annually report tothe Legislature regarding the activities of theminority recruiter. Instead, the board will nowneed to submit an annual report on recruit-ment information and enrollment statisticsfrom the Minnesota State Colleges and Uni-versities institutions that provide the Profes-sional Peace Officer Education Program. Additionally, the measure will repeal a law that empowered mayors and council membersin certain cities to act as peace officers to sup-press riotous or disorderly conduct. Sen. Satveer Chaudhary (DFL-Fridley) spon- sored the law in the Senate. HF570/SF1043*/CH135 Bankruptcy notification A new law will allow greater convenience and less cost to Minnesota residents and busi-nesses that declare bankruptcy. It is effectiveAug. 1, 2001. Often, people declaring bankruptcy seek judgments from a court to cancel debts owedto others. When a court makes such a62NEW LAWS2001Highlights judgment, the bankrupt entities \u2014 be they people or businesses \u2014 are required to notify creditors that they have been relieved fromtheir debts because of having been declaredbankrupt. To accomplish that notification, previous law required bankrupt entities to personallyserve discharges of judgment to all debtors orhire someone else to do that. According to Rep.Rod Skoe (DFL-Clearbrook), House sponsorof the law, that requirement can be very expen-sive for bankrupt people to meet, especiallywhen creditors may live in other states. The law is an effort to mitigate the cost factor involved with bankruptcy declarations. Skoesaid a constituent brought the issue to hisattention. The new law will allow bankrupt people to serve discharges of judgment by certified mailor in person. If done via mail, the law specifiesthat an affidavit of mailing be included in thecertified envelope. Skoe said precedent existsfor sending documents of this type via certifiedmail. Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe (DFL- Erskine) sponsored the bill in the Senate. HF453/SF319*/CH34 Real estate clarification A portion of real estate title law will change under a new law effective April 27, 2001. The measure, sponsored in the House by Rep. Eric Lipman (R-Lake Elmo), is intendedto streamline the Torrens portions of statutegoverning real estate. Lipman explained that there are two systems regulating real estate title law: abstract, in whicha private third party, such as a lawyer, makesdeterminations regarding the chain of real es-tate ownership over the history of the propertyand Torrens law, which simply certifies theparties who currently own or have mortgagesor other interests in the property. The new law allows single owners of mul- tiple tracks of land, such as a housing devel-oper, to file a single declaration creating cov-enants, conditions, and easements. Under pre-vious law, owners of multiple properties had tofile separately for each particular property. County officials testified that registrars might lose revenue but will likely also experience adecrease in workload. The new law also clarifies the state attorney general 's responsibility in cases where the state is the defendant in Torrens law matters. In thefuture, the attorney general may either chooseto represent the state or may refer a case to acounty attorney. Previous law required the attorney general to refer such cases. The Senate version was sponsored by Sen. Thomas Neuville (R-Northfield). The new law preserves former provisions to govern actions pending on April 27, 2001 orstarted before Feb. 1, 2002. HF239*/SF170/CH50 A few good students A new law will require both public and private high schools to release the names, ad-dresses, and phone numbers of students ingrades 11 and 12 to military recruiting officers. Effective May 30, 2001, the law specifies the information may only be released for the pur-pose of providing information about militaryservice, benefits, and career opportunities. Itcannot be given to any other person. Parentsand students have the right to refuse release ofsuch information. Rep. Tom Hackbarth (R-Cedar) sponsored the military recruiting language originallyfound in HF1677. With that provisionHackbarth said he intended to provide themilitary recruiters the same access to studentsafforded colleges and universities. He added that recruiters in his district asked him to help stem the military 's nationwide recruiting shortfalls. The military language is part of a larger bill, sponsored in the House by Rep. Mary LizHolberg (R-Lakeville). She said the legislation,known as the omnibus data practices act, is PHOTO BY ANDREW VON BANKDisallowing discrimination It will be illegal under a new law to inten- tionally discriminate against business contrac-tors because of national origin, a trait notpreviously included in state human rights law. Under previous law, discrimination in busi- ness dealings was illegal if not justified by \"a legitimate business purpose \" but was instead based on race, color, sex, sexual orientation, ordisability. Rep. Mary Liz Holberg (R-Lakeville), who sponsored the bill in the House, said the na-tional origin protection exists elsewhere inlaw, but was lacking in the business discrimi-nation section. She added that the bill madeother technical adjustments to keep state lawcurrent with federal court rulings.

She emphasizedthe bill does not weaken protections for privateinformation. Sen. Richard Cohen (DFL-St. Paul) spon- sored the bill in the Senate. HF767/SF1215*/CH194 Five new district court judges will be hired across the state, and judges will see a pay increase,under a new law.PHOTO BY ANDREW VON BANKNEW JUDGESDiscrimination protection added A new law will change the list of protected characteristics that may not be the basis fordenying someone seeking personal or com-mercial credit. It was previously made illegal for creditors to discriminate on the basis of race, color,creed, religion, disability, national origin, gen-der, sexual orientation, or marital status. Effective Aug. 1, 2001, receiving federal, state, or local public assistance, including medicalassistance, will be added to that list. Also, anyperson who is a tenant receiving federal, state,or local housing subsidies, including rentalassistance, would also be protected from dis-crimination on that basis. The new law repeals a section of law dealing with discrimination based on receiving publicassistance and relocates it in a place in thestatutes that the department said makes thelaw more clear. The legislation also instructs the commis- sioner of human rights to take legal action tocarry out the purposes of the new law. Sen. Satveer Chaudhary (DFL-Fridley) spon- sored the law in the Senate. He said the Depart-ment of Human Rights suggested the new lawin an effort to make that portion of state lawconsistent with other sections. The law was sponsored in the House by Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls). HF1892*/SF1545/CH186State immunity waived A new law will waive Minnesota 's right to immunity to certain federal lawsuits recog-nized by the 11th Amendment to the UnitedStates Constitution. Specifically, the state may now be sued by employees, former employees, or prospectiveemployees aggrieved by any violation of fourfederal laws: the Fair Labor Standards Act, theAge Discrimination in Employment Act, theFamily and Medical Leave Act, and the Ameri-cans with Disabilities Act. The state may alsobe sued by an employee of the state who isaggrieved by the state 's violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The new law is effective Aug. 1, 2001.According to the nonpartisan House Re- search department, recent U.S. Supreme Courtdecisions have held that states must first waivetheir constitutional immunity before beingsubjected to damage lawsuits brought by em-ployees in federal cases. Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), who sponsored the law in the House, said that afailure to waive the state 's immunity \"would have rolled back protection that we have al-ways promised state employees. \" He added he disagreed with the Supreme Court 's ruling, which was decided on a narrow margin in aclosely divided court. Sen. John Hottinger (DFL-Mankato) spon- sored the law in the Senate. HF1655/SF1614*/CH159Ineligible employees State law provides that convicts are not nec- essarily precluded from certain public sectorjobs or obtaining licenses for such jobs merelybecause of their convictions. In fact, if that jobis unrelated to the crime they committed, lawrequires that those convictions not be heldagainst them. However, law also allows for many exemp- tions to this requirement. Such professionsexempted from the law include law enforce-ment officers, firefighters, licensed private de-tectives, health and day care providers, schoolbus drivers, special transportation providers,commercial driving training instructors, taxi-cab drivers, and, in certain cases, juvenile cor-rections employees. Under a new law effective Aug. 1, 2001, emergency service personnel positions will alsobe eligible for exemption. In addition, the new law adds felony and gross misdemeanor indecent exposure to a listof crimes that may disqualify applicants fromthe normal guarantee that their convictionswill not jeopardize their presumption of eligi-bility for certain employment or license appli-cations. Rep. Doug Fuller (R-Bemidji), who spon- sored the legislation in the House, said theEmergency Medical Services Regulatory Board,of which he is a member, brought the issue tohis attention. The board wanted to deny licen-sure to a person convicted of indecent expo-sure, but did not have the authority to do so. Fuller said the new authority provided64NEW LAWS2001Highlights enough flexibility for the board to deny li- censes to applicants they deem unworthy. Sen.

The new law specifies that those capitalimprovements cannot include light rail, com-muter rail or sports facility projects. Additionally, the Metropolitan Council is allowed to issue certificates of indebtedness,bonds, or other obligations up to $45 millionfor capital expenditures for the council 's re- gional transit master and transit capital im-provement plans, effective July 1, 2001. Met Council bonds cannot be used for light- rail transit or commuter rail, either, under thelaw. Rep.

Hesaid along with the bond funds the state will beable to access a federal tax credit to help withthe affordable housing shortage. The new law allocates $84.9 million to the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency, $33.1mil-lion to the city of Minneapolis, $24.8 million tothe city of St. Paul, and $16.6 million to theDakota County Community DevelopmentAgency for housing needs, effective May 30,2001. The Minnesota Higher Education Services Office will be exempt under the new law froma 120-day issuance requirement and will beallowed to carry forward allocations for stu-dent loan bonds up to $25 million into threeconsecutive calendar years, effective May 30,2001.

HF2037/SF2208*/CH214 Equal opportunity grants A new law will make certain elected officials in St. Louis County eligible to participate in afederal grant program. Under previous law, elected officials were prohibited from personally applying for fed-eral community development block grants(CDBG) or economic development adminis-tration funds because of conflict of interestconcerns. Rep. Loren Solberg (DFL-Bovey), the House sponsor of the new law, said he brought themeasure forward on behalf of a business ownerfrom Floodwood who served on the city coun-cil and therefore was not eligible for the samefederal grants that other business owners in thecity received. The new law is limited to cities in St. Louis County with populations of fewer than 5,000people. An officer who wishes to apply for thegrant must abstain from voting on the measureand must disclose as part of the official citycouncil meeting minutes that he or she hasapplied for the funds. Solberg said federal law does not prohibit a person serving on a city council from applyingfor grant money but state conflict of interestlaw did. The new law also contains a statewide provi- sion allowing any governing body to apply forand accept a state or federal grant for housing,community or economic development in whicha public officer may benefit, if the public of-ficer abstains from voting on measures relatedto the grant. Sen. Bob Lessard (Ind.-Int 'l Falls) was the Senate sponsor. The new law is effective Aug. 1, 2001.HF610/SF974*/CH132 Credit the account During 2000, a new law allowed Hennepin County taxpayers the option of paying obliga-tions and claims to the county via electronicmeans. The program has worked well enough to prompt a new law this year that expands thatoption to all cities and counties in the state. Under the measure, local jurisdictions are65Highlights NEW LAWS2001 permitted to accept payments by credit card, debit card, or all forms of electronic or wirefunds transfer. The city or county is allowed toadd a service charge to the amount due for thecosts associated with the acceptance of thepayment method. The new law will also allow cities and coun- ties to pay their obligations or investments viaelectronic or wire funds transfer. Both por-tions of the law are effective Aug. 1, 2001. A city council or town board is also autho- rized to permit a person to use a credit card onbehalf of the government entity for purchasingpurposes. That employee or officer is person-ally liable for the amount of unauthorizedpurchases. Similar authority was granted tocounty officials last year. This portion of thelaw is effective April 7, 2001.

HF1016/SF509*/CH13 Governmental gift concerns A new law effective May 15, 2001 clarifies that local officials will be allowed to enjoy foodand beverages at certain conferences withoutworrying if they are violating the state 's gift ban law. Previous law prohibited government offi- cials from accepting gifts from a person or arepresentative of an association that has a di-rect financial interest in a decision the officialis authorized to make. The new law provides for an exception to the ban on gifts. The new law provides that theprohibition does not apply when the recipientis an attendee at a conference sponsored by anational or multi-state organization where thegift is food or beverages given at a reception ormeal and an equivalent gift is given or offeredto all other attendees. The new law, which was supported by repre- sentatives from the League of Minnesota Cit-ies, is comparable to an advisory opinion of-fered by the Campaign Finance and PublicDisclosure Board that applies to legislators. That opinion determined that the law 's pro- hibition of meals and receptions for Minne-sota officials paid for in part with contribu-tions from lobbyists does not apply when theequivalent gift is given to all members of agroup. The new law clarifies that the exemption also applies to local government officials andthat the exemption is limited to food and bev-erage items.Rep. Larry Howes (R-Walker) and Sen. John Hottinger (DFL-Mankato) were the sponsorsof the measure. HF2110/SF1441*/CH93 Creating new counties A new law will clarify and update the provi- sions regarding the creation of new counties. Rep. Bill Hilty (DFL-Finlayson), the House sponsor of the measure, said the law came as aresult of an unsuccessful attempt in 2000 ofsome Pine County residents to split that countyand create a new Pioneer County. Hilty said the issues involved in the potential new county have been resolved and the newlaw addresses gaps in state statute identifiedduring the process. Under previous law, both the new and old county must have a market value of at least$17 million. For a county with greater than3,500 population and fewer than 6,000 squaremiles, the threshold amount is $10 million. The new law effective Aug. 1, 2001 requires that a proposed new county have total taxablemarket value of at least 35 percent of the totaltaxable market value of the existing county orthe counties affected by the proposal. The pro-posed new county must also have a populationof at least 4,000 people. The law will also require that a petition to establish a new county be signed by at least anumber of registered voters equal to one-fourthof those voting in each portion of both theproposed new county and the remaining por-tion of the existing county in the previousgeneral election. A majority vote is needed in both the area forming the new county and in the remainingportion of the existing county to certifyestablishment. Sen. Becky Lourey (DFL-Kerrick) sponsored the law in the Senate. HF1544/SF1367*/CH198 Official appointments Those who want to be the auditor-treasurer or recorder in Goodhue County may not haveto hit the campaign trail under a new law. Upon adoption of a resolution by the county board of commissioners, the law will allow thecounty the option to change the auditor-treasurer and recorder positions from electedspots to appointed ones. The law requires the resolution be approved by 80 percent of the members of the board.Before adopting the resolution a published notification of the proposal must run in twoconsecutive weeks in the official publication ofthe county. The new law will also require that the issue go before voters if a petition requesting a refer-endum on the matter is signed by at least10 percent of the registered voters in the county. Jeff Cole, Goodhue County auditor-treasurer, said other counties have come before the Legis-lature to get the auditor, treasurer, and recorderpositions changed from one requiring electionto an appointment. He said the positions havebecome more and more technical in nature. Rep. Jerry Dempsey (R-Red Wing) and Sen. Steve Murphy (DFL-Red Wing) were thesponsors. The new law is effective upon local approval.HF2036*/SF1685/CH184 Recorder appointment A new law will allow the Wright County Board to adopt a resolution changing the countyrecorder position from an elected one to anappointment. Wright County Commissioner Ken Jude said the change will allow the county greater flex-ibility in structuring its services. He said al-though elected positions such as county re-corder or treasurer make decisions about op-erations within their offices, they have nopolicy-making authority. The new law requires the resolution be ap- proved by four-fifths of the county board.Before adoption of the resolution the board isrequired to publish a notice and allow publiccomment on the proposed change. Voters of the county can also request a refer- endum vote on the change through a petition. Rep. Bruce Anderson (R-Buffalo Township) and Sen. Mark Ourada (R-Buffalo) were thesponsors of the measure. The new law is effective upon local approval.HF1340*/SF908/CH180 Appoint, rather than elect A new law will allow a few elected positions in Cass and Hubbard counties to become ap-pointed positions. Prior to the new law, the auditor, treasurer, and recorder were elected positions in HubbardCounty. The new law allows the county boardto adopt a resolution by an 80 percent vote tochange those offices to appointed positions. Likewise in Cass County, the auditor-66NEW LAWS2001Highlights treasurer and recorder positions are now elected by voters, but could become appointed posi-tions if the county board approves the change. The law requires that the county boards publish a notice notifying the public of theproposed changes. Voters can request a refer-endum on the matter by submitting a petitionsigned by at least 10 percent of the registeredvoters of the county. The original bill, sponsored by Rep. Larry Howes (R-Walker), was much broader in scopeand would have allowed all counties to makethe decision on whether to change certain po-sitions from elected to appointed. But afterthat bill was defeated in the House, Howesamended it to limit the scope to just Cass andHubbard counties. General law governing counties allow them to change the positions by a referendum ap-proval of voters. The measure was brought forward by offi- cials from the two counties. Sen. Sandra Pappas (DFL-St. Paul) was the Senate sponsor. The new law is effective upon local approval.HF1290/SF510*/CH105 Containing stray cattle A new law might cause a collective sigh of relief from both the head of town boardsthroughout the state and also certain roaminganimals. Effective Aug. 1, 2001, the new law repeals a requirement that the chair of the town boardcastrate a stallion, bull, boar, or ram running atlarge if the owner is notified and continues toallow the animal to roam free. The mandatory castration statute was a sec- tion of the law establishing regulation of strayanimals and imposing penalties to animal own-ers who allow their animals to roam free off theirproperty. The law was established in 1947. The law instituted a $5 per day penalty to an owner of a stallion, bull, boar, ram, or breachycattle running at large in town. Breachy cattlewere those that are known to have a tempera-ment for breaking down fences or damagingproperty. Rep. Marty Seifert (R-Marshall), the House sponsor, said the particular obsolete law wasbrought to his attention by his late father, aformer township official who had come acrossit more than 20 years ago and was surprised tosee it still on the books. Sen. Arlene Lesewski (R-Marshall) was the Senate sponsor. HF394/SF327*/CH21Continuity sought A new law will strengthen the state building code by preventing municipalities from adopt-ing an ordinance or including a provision in adevelopment agreement that is different fromthe state code. Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka), the House sponsor, said the law is an effort tostimulate the construction of more affordablehousing by providing more standardization ofgovernment regulatory fees. The different fees charged by jurisdictions might cause the cost of construction of identi-cal homes to vary from city to city, Abramssaid. Establishing more standard building regu-lations will lead to lower costs, and thus moreaffordable housing in the state. Under the new law effective Aug. 1, 2001, municipalities will face new limits for the per-mit fees they can charge for certain projects.The maximum fee for an improvement, instal-lation, or replacement of a residential fixtureor appliance, which does not require electric orgas service and costs less than $500, would be$15 or 5 percent of the project cost, whicheveris greater. The new law will not prohibit municipalities from adopting ordinances relating to zoning,subdivision, or planning unless the ordinanceconflicts with the state building code. And itwill allow a municipality to adopt an ordi-nance that is more restrictive than the statebuilding code when geological conditions war-rant stricter restrictions. Sen. Doug Johnson (DFL-Tower) was the Senate sponsor. HF1310*/SF1205/CH207 Liquor licenses authorized A new law will allow the sale of liquor at specific establishments in certain cities. The law will authorize the city of Minneapo- lis to issue on-sale wine and beer licenses to theBrave New Institute and the Loring Playhouse. The city of St. Paul will be able to authorize on-sale intoxicating liquor licenses to the GreatAmerican History Theatre and Flanagan's Wake at the Palace Theatre, and an on-sale wine andmalt liquor license to the capitol cafeteria forspecial events. The cities of Blaine, Elk River, and Moorhead are authorized to issue six additional on-saleintoxicating liquor licenses, and the city of St.Louis Park will be authorized to issue 12 addi-tional licenses. The new law allows on-sale liquor licensees of machines to premix and dispense frozen oriced cocktails, if the machine is emptied daily. It also provides the machine does not have tobe available to the public. This provision iseffective Aug. 1, 2001. Local provisions are effective upon local approval. The law was sponsored in the Houseby Rep. Doug Stang (R-Cold Spring) and in theSenate by Sen. Sam Solon (DFL-Duluth). In addition, the law requires the establish- ment of a 10-member committee, includingfive non-legislative members, to study the rela-tionship between beer wholesalers and smallbrewers. Among those subject to examinationwill be contracts between brewers and whole-salers and desirability of small brewers to selltheir own products at wholesale. The commit-tee must report its findings to the Legislatureby Feb. 15, 2002.

Theboard had been set to expire July 1, 2002. Rep. Jim Rhodes (R-St. Louis Park), the House sponsor, said the additional time isneeded to complete the board 's work. The board was created in 1995 to adopt a region-wide public safety radio system com-munication plan. Its membership includes acounty commissioner from each of the sevencounties in the Twin Cities metropolitan area,elected officials from St. Paul, Minneapolis,and Bloomington, and a sheriff and policechief appointed by the governor. The law requires the board to submit a report to the Legislature by Feb. 1, 2002 that will includefinancial projections on future capital and oper-ating costs, and a recommendation on whetherto transfer duties and responsibilities to a stateagency, an independent agency, or to an associa-tion of local units of government. If the board 's recommendation is to become an independent agency, the law requires theboard to submit recommendations on chang-ing its size, name, and the makeup of its geo-graphical representation. Sen. Steve Kelley (DFL-Hopkins) sponsored the measure in the Senate. The changes in the law are effective Aug. 1, 2001.

The new law, sponsored by Rep. Sondra Erickson (R-Princeton), allows people to op-erate ATVs on multi-purpose trails crossingthe Kettle and Rum rivers in Pine and MilleLacs counties. The crossings were previouslyrestricted by Department of Natural Resources(DNR) rules protecting wild and scenic rivers. \"We want ATVers to enjoy their sport, \" explained Erickson. \"At the same time, a river designation is a special designation \u2014 at least now [crossing] is legitimate. \" In anticipation of the findings of a broader trail study, the new law on all-terrain vehicleswill expire four years from its effective date ofMay 25, 2001, or earlier if the DNR adopts astatewide plan to address all locations where trails meet protected rivers. Another provision requires the DNR to con- tinue grant-in-aid snowmobile trail access ordevelop an alternative route when the stateacquires land that has existing trail easements. The Senate version was sponsored by Sen. Dan Stevens (R-Mora).

Thecrossings were previously restricted by Departmentof Natural Resources rules protecting wild andscenic rivers. Horse track employment regulations A new law effective May 1, 2001 eases em- ployment restrictions at the state 's horse rac- ing track. Under previous law, people seeking em- ployment in horse racing where pari-mutuelbetting was allowed had to obtain a class Coccupational license offered by the racing com-mission. Those that had been convicted of afelony were prohibited from obtaining thelicense. The new law modifies that restriction to those who have a felony of record.68NEW LAWS2001Highlights Rep. Mark Buesgens (R-Jordan), who spon- sored the law in the House, said the restrictionprohibited those who were convicted of a felonybut later had the conviction overturned onappeal, or those who completed their sentence,from working at the track. Another provision of the new law increases the legal amount of an anti-inflammatory drugthat a test blood sample from a horse can beallowed to have under the medication rules ofthe state 's racing commission. The law allows five micrograms per millili- ter of blood as the maximum level for drugssuch as phenylbutazone. That particular drugis commonly used to treat laminitis, a chronicfoot ailment among horses. The previous lawallowed three micrograms. Sen. David Tomassoni (DFL-Chisholm) was the Senate sponsor. HF995*/SF1214/CH59 How long can you go? During the Depression era, dance mara- thons became a fad, prompting people to liter-ally dance the night away in contests. The lastcouple standing carried home the prize money. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Mike Ritof and Edith Boudreaux holdthe all time dance endurance record, swayingfor 5,154 hours and 48 minutes at the MerryGarden Ballroom in Chicago from August 29,1930, to April 1, 1931. The couple was awarded$2,000 for their efforts. But such contests posed health risks. Across the country, a couple of people even died par-ticipating in the marathons. In 1935, the Minnesota Legislature passed a law prohibiting endurance contests. The lawmade it a misdemeanor for any person, firm,or corporation to participate, attend, or pro-mote endurance contests. Effective Aug. 1, 2001, a new law repeals that prohibition. The repeal is one of several severalnew laws passed during the 2001 session re-pealing old and obsolete laws. Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville) and Sen.

Legislation in 1993 granted early retirement incentives that included the option for theretired employee and their spouse to continuein the school district 's health plan at no charge until the retired employee reached age 65,which is the age of Medicare eligibility. At thattime, however, younger spouses were no longercovered. The new law allows spouses to be eligible for the school district 's health plan at their own expense until they reach age 65. A spouse, whose coverage may have been discontinued but who wishes to be coveredunder the plan as a result of this law, mustnotify the former employer within 180 days ofthe effective date of this law.

Under the new law, the holder of a Class D driver 's license \u2014 the license issued to anyone wishing to drive a regular car, truck, or van \u2014 without a school bus endorsement, may oper-ate a van-type school bus with a gross weight of10,000 pounds or less and a capacity of 15 orfewer people including the driver. This is only true if 14 conditions provided in the law are met, including the following: the operator is an employee of the entity that owns, leases, or contracts for the bus; the operator drives only from points of origin to points of destination, but not for home-to-school or vice versa trips; the operator provides annual training in, among other things, training and certifica-tion in safe operation of the vehicle, under-standing student behavior, handling mis-conduct appropriately and safe loading andunloading of students; and a driver background check has been completed.The law will also allow licensed childcare providers to use buses that look like schoolbuses except that the stop arm has been re-moved, the eight-light system is deactivated,and it is identified as a \"childcare bus \" in letters at least eight inches high on the front and reartop of the bus. Such vehicles must be furtheridentified with the name, address, and phonenumber of the owner or operator on each frontdoor in letters no smaller than three incheshigh. Rep. Tom Workman (R-Chanhassen) spon- sored the measure in the House. He said therewas some concern expressed regarding the69Highlights NEW LAWS2001 smaller vans being unsafe for student trans- port to and from events. Previous licensinglaws limited a district 's ability to use larger buses because they didn 't have enough drivers. He suggested the new law will make conditionssafer. Sen. Sandra Pappas (DFL-St. Paul) spon- sored the law in the Senate. The provisions of the new law expire July 1, 2003. HF2181/SF2225*/CH97 School bus driver regulations A new law, effective June 1, 2001, could prevent some sex offenders from driving schoolbuses. Sponsored in the House by Rep. Carol Molnau (R-Chaska), the new law specificallybars those convicted of certain sex offenses \u2014 illegal use of minors in sexual performance,possession of pornography containing minors,or dissemination or display of harmful mate-rial to minors \u2014 from driving school buses. The new law applies to offenses committed before, on, or after June 1. Existing law regard-ing licensed bus drivers bars any felon or any-one convicted of the following crimes: a drugoffense, driving a school bus while intoxicated,indecent exposure, or other forms of childabuse. The new law follows testimony by Chaska Police Chief Scott Knight that sexual offendershave acquired permission to drive school busesafter concealing their identity. The Senate version was sponsored by Sen. Claire Robling (R-Prior Lake). HF57*/SF27/CH25 Staffing rural ambulances Because staffing levels for rural ambulance and public safety personnel fluctuate and popu-lations in rural communities are diminishing,those communities need more flexibility forstaffing while they recruit and train newpersonnel. A new law will provide that flexibility for rural ambulance services, effective Aug. 1, 2001. Under the law, the Emergency Medical Ser- vices Regulatory Board may grant rural ambu-lance services a temporary variance to staffingrequirements. State law requires that a basic life support ambulance must be staffed with two ambu-lance service personnel, one of whom must bean EMT. Therefore, the requirement would bemet by one of the following combinations: two EMTs, one EMT and one registered nurse, orone EMT and one physician assistant. The variance would allow, for up to one year, rural ambulance services to staff with oneEMT and one first responder. According tostate law, a first responder is a person regis-tered to perform basic emergency skills beforethe arrival of a licensed ambulance service.First responders are members of an organizedservice recognized by a city or county to pro-vide initial medical care before the ambulancearrives. Rep. Elaine Harder (R-Jackson), the House sponsor, said a constituent who is an EMTbrought her the idea for the initiative this year.She said many of the communities in her dis-trict are finding it hard to meet the require-ments in state law because of the time it takesto train emergency medical professionals. Thereis a shortage of people to draw volunteersfrom, as well. She also cited the fact that many people are required to work long distances from theirhomes, which doesn 't allow them to be on-call during working hours. The plan, drafted with the help of the board, should help alleviate those concerns on a tem-porary basis, she said. Sen. Jim Vickerman (DFL-Tracy) sponsored the Senate version. HF1748*/SF2097/CH74 Negligence standard changed A new law effective Aug. 1, 2001 will change the definition of a negligently caused fire. Previous law stated that a person who \"is culpably negligent in causing a fire to burn orget out of control \" has committed a crime, the severity of which depends upon the value ofthe damage caused. Under the change, the word \"culpably \" is replaced with \"grossly. \" Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the new law in the House. He explained \"cul- pably \" was \"an archaic word not really used anymore. \" Fire investigators brought the mat- ter to his attention, he said. According to nonpartisan House Research, \"culpable negligence \" means disregard of the consequences that may ensue from an act andindifference to the rights of others. It is inten-tional conduct that may not be intended toharm but a reasonably prudent person wouldrecognize as involving a strong probability ofinjury to others. On the other hand, \"gross negligence \" means\"without even scant care but not with such reckless disregard of probable consequences asis equivalent to a willful and intentional wrong. \" By changing the standard from culpable negligence to gross negligence, officials sug-gest, the standard of proof placed on prosecu-tors will decrease because they no longer needto prove recklessness to obtain a conviction. As an example, Skoglund referred to the makers of the illegal narcotic methamphet-amine who negligently cause fires \"all over the state \" but are not convicted under the existing standard. \"Clearly, they are being grossly neg- ligent, \" he said. He added that he expects more successful prosecutions of methamphetaminemanufacturers under the new law. The new law was sponsored by Sen. Satveer Chaudhary (DFL-Fridley) in the Senate. HF992/SF1552*/CH155 Housing assistance for firefighters A new law effective April 12, 2001 will give cities the authority to provide housing assis-tance for volunteer firefighters and ambulancepersonnel. The law, sponsored in the House by Rep. Harry Mares (R-White Bear Lake), allows cit-ies to offer the assistance to attract and retainqualified personnel necessary to ensure timelypublic safety service. Mares said he sponsored the bill on behalf of the city of Mahtomedi who is seeking help inattracting volunteer firefighters to the city. The legislation was necessary because of a precedent established by a 1952 state attorneygeneral opinion. That opinion held that thecity of Newport did not have the authority toprovide living quarters to its police chief unlessthe Legislature granted special authority. Sen. Charles Wiger (DFL-North St. Paul) was the Senate sponsor. HF172/SF9*/CH19 Propane research council A state propane education and research council can be formed, under a new law. Rep. Larry Howes (R-Walker), who spon- sored the measure in the House, said the coun-cil will provide educational programs admin-istered by fire departments to help teach peoplethe proper use of propane in homes and inrecreational uses, such as ice fishing houses. Howes said language in the law conforms with federal legislation passed in 1996 relatingto the propane industry. That legislation70NEW LAWS2001Highlights allowed propane education and research coun- cils to be formed under guidelines that ensuredanti-trust concerns were not violated. The new law specifies that propane produc- ers and retail marketers may assess an amountnot to exceed one-tenth of one cent per gallonof odorized propane to help pay for the costs ofthe council. Federal law prohibits that costfrom being passed on to the consumer, Howessaid. The law also specifies that the council report annually to the Department of Public Safetydetailing its collections and expenditures. Sen. Steve Murphy (DFL-Red Wing) was the Senate sponsor. The law is effective Aug. 1, 2001. If no coun- cil has been established by Aug. 1, 2004 the newlaw will be repealed.

The omnibus tax law was at the center of the budget stalemate that led to the calling of aspecial session. House Republicans and Gov. Jesse Ventura 's administration pushed for what they called\"historic property tax reform \" while Senate Democrats expressed concern over the amountof funding for education in the state. The new law incorporates changes in the property tax system while establishing a newstatewide general tax that will be imposed onbusiness property and seasonal recreationalresidential property. Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka) and Sen. Lawrence Pogemiller (DFL-Mpls) sponsoredthe measure. The following are highlights of the law.2001 Special Session HF1*/SF13/CH5 Property taxes and education The measure contains class rate reductions across all property types, as well as the elimina-tion of the state-determined general educationlevy. Agricultural and seasonal recreational prop- erties will be exempt from school district refer-endum levies, under the new law. PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID All classes of property will receive a break, including homeowners and apartment owners, under the taxlaw passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Jesse Ventura.Under the previous education funding sys- tem, 25 percent of the $7.3 billion cost of K-12funding came from property taxes. Of that 25percent, 48 percent, or about $900 million, wasthe cost of the state-determined general educa-tion levy. The new law also replaces up to $415 per pupil of operating referendum property taxeswith funding from the state 's general fund. Districts with less than $415 per pupil operat-ing referendum will receive additional state aidup to $415. (Art. 2, Secs. 1-29) Class rate compression The law reduces the range of variation in the state 's property class rate system in which dif- ferent types of properties at different valueswere previously taxed at different rates. Forexample, residential homestead property up to$76,000 was taxed at 1 percent but any valueover that amount was taxed at 1.65 percent.Under the new law, residential homesteadproperty valued at $500,000 or less will betaxed at 1 percent with the value over thatamount taxed at 1.25 percent. Apartments will see some of the biggest re- ductions under the measure, as the regularapartment rate is reduced from 2.4 percent to1.8 percent in 2002 and then further reduced to1.5 percent in 2003 and 1.25 percent in 2004and thereafter. Abrams said that although the relief goes to apartment property owners rather than rent-ers, the reduction will stimulate more con-struction of apartments in the state.71Highlights NEW LAWS2001 Under the new law, the state 's property tax refund program is enhanced to increase themaximum homeowner property tax refundfrom $510 to $1,500. The maximum eligibleincome to qualify for the refund has also beenincreased from $71,100 to $80,000. A sticking point in the budget negotiations was the amount of class rate reduction forcommercial/industrial properties. The new lawreduces those rates from the previous 2.4 per-cent on property valued up to $150,000 to1.5 percent. For the portion of the property 's market value that is greater than $150,000 therate is reduced from 3.4 percent to 2 percent.(Art. 3, Secs. 32-36) A new statewide general tax of $592 million levied on commercial-industrial and seasonal-recreational properties is established, underthe new law. Future growth in that tax is dedi-cated to education funding. (Art. 3, Sec. 46) Sales tax rebate The new law authorizes a sales tax rebate of $791 million. That amount reflects the finalfiscal year 2001 surplus as certified by thecommissioner of the Department of Financeon July 15. Officials estimate checks will be inthe mail by Labor Day. The law directed the commissioner of the Department of Revenue to adjust the rebateschedule so that the total will equal the$791 million surplus. The minimum rebate is $213 for married couples filing a joint return and for heads ofhouseholds. A maximum amount of $2,967 isalso established for those taxpayers.For single filers the minimum is $108, with a maximum amount of $1,484. The rebate will be mailed out automatically to about 2.4 million taxpayers, including thosewho filed a Minnesota income tax return andpaid either Minnesota or federal income tax in1999; those age 18 or over who received socialsecurity benefits or a public pension in 1999;those who paid no income tax but received arefundable income tax credit in 1999; and anyrenter or homeowner who received a propertytax refund for 1999. (Art. 1, Secs. 2-3) Energy savings Utility property will receive a property tax savings due to rate compression and becausethe statewide general tax does not apply tomachinery related to energy generation, underthe law. The law requires the Public Utilities Com- mission to reduce the rates charged to its cus-tomers to reflect that portion of the utility 's property tax reduction related to its generatingattached machinery. The commission is re-quired to ensure to the extent feasible that thatportion of the utilities property tax reductionis passed on to its customers. (Art. 3, Sec. 11) An emissions reduction rider is also included in the new law. The rider allows certain costs tobe passed on to consumers relating directly tothe utility 's expenditures of reducing and/or improving emissions levels at existing largeelectric generating power plants. Qualifying facilities are required to emit contaminants at levels that are in compliancewith the Clean Air Act standards or produce areduction in emissions to the lowest cost- effective level. (Art. 3, Sec. 12) Energy efficient products A new sales tax provision allows a temporary exemption for the purchase of certain energyefficient products. The measure exempts residential lighting fixtures and compact fluorescent bulbs thathave an Energy Star Label, a U.S. Environmen-tal Protection Agency labeling program de-signed to identify and promote energy efficientproducts. Electric heat pump hot water heaters with an energy factor of at least 1.9, and natural gas waterheaters with an energy factor of at least .62qualify for the exemption under the new law. Natural gas water heaters with an annual fuel utilization efficiency of greater than 92 percentreceive an exemption as do photovoltaic de-vices, which convert light into electricity. The law requires that the water heaters and furnaces have energy guide labels that indicatethe product meets or exceeds the requiredstandards. The sales tax exemption is effective from Aug. 1, 2001 to July 1, 2005. (Art. 12, Sec. 44) Transit funding The Metropolitan Council 's authority to levy property taxes to pay for the operating costs oftransit systems has been eliminated. To replacethe levy, which expires after fiscal year 2002,20.5 percent of the revenues from the sales taxon motor vehicles is dedicated in 2003 and22.5 percent in the following years. PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID The omnibus tax law reduces the state's taconite production tax by 10 percent. The new rate is frozen until 2004. Additionally, a one-time $10 million appropriation is provided to fund a transitional aid to taconite cities and towns for taxes payable in 2002.72NEW LAWS2001Highlights The new law also dedicates 1.25 percent of the sales tax on motor vehicles to replace prop-erty taxes as a funding source for transit oper-ating expenses in Greater Minnesota. (Art. 3,Sec. 2) Mineral taxes The new law reduces the state 's taconite production tax by 10 percent from $2.173 pergross ton to $2.103. The new rate will be in-dexed beginning in production year 2004. Thestate will fund this loss of revenue and alsoprovide revenue equal to a tax increase in theinvestment credit for mining companies.(Art. 6, Sec. 22) A one-time estimated $10 million appro- priation from the taconite relief account isprovided to fund a transitional aid to taconitecities and towns for taxes payable in 2002.(Art. 6, Sec. 38) The new law also will allow counties to impose a gravel tax at a rate of up to 10 cents percubic yard, or up to 7 cents per ton, withauthorization of the county board. Severalcounties have been given the authority by theLegislature in prior years to impose a gravel taxto help maintain roads. The new law expandsthat authority to all counties. Income taxes Among changes to the income tax laws is an appropriation of $200,000 for low-incometaxpayer assistance. (Art 9, Sec. 29) Certain banks will receive a tax break as the state 's tax law now fully conforms with federal treatment of banks that have electedsubchapter S status under the IRS tax code. Since 1997, federal law has allowed financial institutions to elect S corporation status if theymet certain requirements (no publicly tradedstock, less than 75 percent stockholders). AsS corporations, the federal government taxesthem like partnerships. They are exempt fromthe federal corporate income tax, but the busi-ness income is directly taxed to its sharehold-ers even if it is not distributed as dividends. Minnesota did not immediately conform to federal law. Beginning in 1999, Minnesota en-acted partial conformity. Although S corpora-tion banks had to pay the state corporate fran-chise tax, their shareholders could claim anincome tax credit equal to 80 percent of thatcorporate tax. The new law fully conforms to federal law by exempting S corporations banks from the cor-porate franchise tax and repealing the 80 per-cent income tax credit. (Art. 9, Sec. 30)Sales tax The new law eliminates what Rep. Abrams calls the last remaining \"accounting gimmick \" used to balance the state 's books during tight budget years in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Under prior law retailers with at least $120,000 in annual sales tax collections were required topay 62 percent of their estimated June sales taxliability two business days before June 30. Therest of the year they are required to pay the taxesby the 14th of the following month. The new law eliminates the June accelerated payment beginning with June 2002 payments.(Art. 12, Sec. 1) Streamlined sales tax During 2000, a multi-state effort known as the \"Streamlined Sales Tax Project \" began look- ing at ways of simplifying administration ofthe sales-and-use tax for sellers in the hope thata more universal system would mean highercompliance with existing laws and more col-lections by remote sellers. The project was also meant to address con- cerns of \"Main Street \" business owners who sought to ensure that remote sellers don 't have an unfair advantage because they aren 't col- lecting and remitting sales taxes. The 39 states participating in the project developed a standard act that provides modellegislation and the provisions required for astate to enter into the agreement. Adoption of the streamlined project by a number of states may result in either the U.S.Congress imposing a duty to collect the tax oninterstate sellers or the courts overturning ex-isting case law that prohibits states from im-posing the duty to collect. The new law adopts the provisions that will allow the state to enter into the agreement. Italso will implement the uniform definitionsand standards developed by the project. The law defines uniform sourcing rules, de- fining to which state can impose a sales tax onan interstate sale. Under the measure, inter-state sales are generally taxed at the destinationsite. (Art. 12, Sec. 35) There are quirks to some of the new defini- tions. For example, some items previously taxedwill now be exempt. Included in this categoryare ice, bottled water, unsweetened tea, singleservings of ice cream treats, snack foods sold inbars and restaurants, and near beer. Likewise, items that were exempt in the past are subject to sales tax under the measure.These include chocolate chips, mini-marshmallows, and beverages containing morethan 15 percent but less than 50 percent juice.Installation and delivery charges will also beincluded in the sales price and are subject Concert loophole closed A provision of the new law will close what some considered a loophole in the state 's sales tax laws that allowed many big name perform-ers to stage shows without collecting sales taxon admission fees. 2001 Rebate* Married filing jointly, head ofhousehold, or qualifying widow(er) or more ....................................... $2,967 Single or married filing separately Income Estimated * Rebate based on 1999 sales tax receiptsSource: Department of Revenue73Highlights NEW LAWS2001 Under the old law, a sales tax exemption was allowed for a for-profit concert organizer whoteamed with a nonprofit organization to co-sponsor a show. The new law clarifies that a nonprofit organization only qualifies for the exemptionif the ticket sales are recorded on its books. Thelaw requires that a specified percentage of theorganization 's revenue come from charitable contributions and also requires that all netrevenues from the event be used to fund otherart events. (Art. 12, Sec 62) Second chance The new law allows the Department of Rev- enue to re-issue property tax refunds and salestax rebates to taxpayers that can show reason-able cause as to why another check needs to beissued. Under prior law, the right to a property tax refund lapsed if the check was not cashedwithin two years after it was issued. According to the department, 1998 prop- erty tax refund checks totaling $549,000 haveyet to be cashed and have thus lapsed. For the1999 sales tax rebate, checks worth a total of$458,000 have not been cashed. The law limits the department 's authority to re-issue checks to five years after the refund orrebate was originally issued. (Art. 20, Sec. 6) Environmental provisions A Sustainable Forest Incentive Act is estab- lished under the new law effective for taxespayable in 2003 and thereafter. The law statesthe purpose of the act is to \"encourage the state 's private forest landowners to make a long-term commitment to sustainable forestmanagement \" by providing those landowners an annual incentive payment. Qualified property must be at least 20 con- tiguous acres with at least 50 percent of theland forested. The land must stay enrolled inthe program for eight years. The law requires landowners enrolling more than 1,920 acres in the program to allow accessfor fishing and hunting except within a quartermile of a permanent dwelling. (Art. 8,Secs. 5-15) Penalty reform The new law reforms the penalties for those who don 't file a tax return or remit a required tax payment. For failure to file individual income tax re- turns the penalty is reduced from a one-timepenalty of 10 percent to 5 percent of the tax due.For corporate returns, the prior system of ascaled penalty is changed to a one-time penaltyof five percent of the tax due. (Art. 11, Sec. 3) The new law also modifies the penalties for those who fail to pay a tax. For delinquent individual income tax pay- ments, the penalty is 4 percent of the unpaidtax. If the Department of Revenue issues anorder assessing additional individual incometax and the tax is not paid within 60 days, anadditional 4 percent penalty is added. For corporations and other businessentities, the penalty amount is set at 6 percent. Again, if the department issues an order assess-ing additional tax, then a penalty of 5 percentof the unpaid tax is added to the penalty. (Art.11, Sec. 2) The new law extends the state 's $500 penalty for all frivolous returns to all tax returns andclaims for refunds. Previously the penalty onlyapplied to individual income tax returns. (Art.11, Sec. 5) Biomedical Innovation Initiative An initiative providing for a collaborative effort involving the University of Minnesota,the state 's medical technology industry, and private investors is established under the newlaw. A $10 million grant is provided to establish a for-profit entity to help advance commercialapplications for biomedical research and tech-nologies developed at the university. The law directs the Department of Trade and Economic Development to establish theBiomedical Innovation CommercializationInitiative as a joint public/private venture toaddress the state 's ability to continue to com- pete in the rapidly changing medical technol-ogy and research industries. Among the duties of the new entity will be to promote the values of technologies being de-veloped by the biomedical academic commu-nity and add business expertise and enhancethe commercial value of the technologies de-veloped at the university. The board of the new entity will consist of a representative appointed by the governor, arepresentative selected by the university, andfive representatives from Minnesota 's medical technology industry chosen by the privateinvestors. The state 's grant is contingent on receiving three-to-one matching contributions fromother sources. (Art. 19, Secs. 1-2) Miscellaneous policy provisions The new law re-establishes a cap on the amount cities and counties can increase theirtax levies. The levy limits apply to municipali-ties with populations greater than 2,500 fortaxes levied in 2001 and 2002, payable in 2002and 2003. (Art. 16) The state will continue its takeover of dis- trict court administration costs, under the newlaw. The takeover is effective as follows: thesecond and fourth districts in the Twin Citiesmetropolitan area in 2003, the first and thirddistricts in southeastern Minnesota in 2004,and the sixth and 10th districts north and eastof the Twin Cities in 2005. (Art. 5, Sec. 15) PHOTO BY ANDREW VON BANK The governor's plan to extend sales tax to additional services was not included in the omnibus tax bill duringthe 2001 session. Sales taxes on goods, such as those being purchased here, remain at current levels. 74NEW LAWS2001Highlights A new income tax subtraction is allowed under the new law, as musical instrumentsused in classes now can be claimed as a K-12education expense. Previously instruments that were rented qualified for the subtraction but those instru-ments purchased by the student did not. TheDepartment of Revenue indicated the reasonthe state made the distinction was people whobuy an instrument have something of valuethat can be resold but people who rent instru-ments do not. (Art. 9, Sec. 11) The new law provides an exemption of mili- tary pay of active duty personnel stationedoutside of Minnesota. (Art. 9, Sec. 2) A reduced 1.5 percent health care provider tax is extended for two additional years, underthe new law. That tax was scheduled to increaseto 2 percent on Jan. 1, 2002. The originalHouse proposal to eliminate the tax was notadopted by the working group. (Art. 14, Sec. 6) The new law increases the state 's budget reserve from $622 million to $653 million.(Art. 20, Sec. 22) K-12 funding law: General education revenue (See Education, page 23) Tax-free troubles (See Bills in Limbo, page 102) TECHNOLOGY# TOURISM#Funding early education, communities: Libraries (See Children, page 16) Funding for state agencies: Public TV going digital (See Government, page 40) Fair foundation established (See Agriculture, page 10) A cleaner Minnesota: Other agencies (See Environment, page 33) Worthington program management (See Greater Minnesota, page 44) Transit, road, public safety funding: Other policy provisions (See Transportation, page 76)TRANSPORTATION# Transit, road, public safety funding A new $3.5 billion transportation and public safety funding law funds transit and road op-erations, road construction projects, and anumber of criminal justice functions duringthe 2002-03 biennium. The law also provides a number of policy items relating to transportation and publicsafety. About 63 percent of funding for transporta- tion comes from the trunk highway fund. Thelaw includes only about $211 million from thegeneral fund, which is equal to about 6 percentof the overall transportation budget for thestate. The law provides about $5 million in new funding for Greater Minnesota transit func-tions, as well as $30 million more for TwinCities metropolitan area transit operations. About $534 million in general fund spend- ing is included in the law to fund operations forthe Department of Public Safety, the state courtsystem, and other criminal justice programs.About $95 million is new money, includingapproximately $27 million for the continueddevelopment of the state 's CriMNet criminal justice information network. As part of the CriMNet funding, the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension must work to elimi-nate the existing suspense file where recordsand fingerprints on file do not match, there-fore causing holes in the background checkprocess. (Art. 6, Sec. 3) Language affecting the creation of a felony drunken driving penalty is included in boththis law and the omnibus health, human ser- vices, and corrections law. Appropriations forthe new penalty are also included in both laws.(See related story, page 55) Gov. Jesse Ventura line-item vetoed a public safety appropriation for $300,000 in commu-nity oriented policing and other intensive en-forcement projects provided in the measure.(See related story, page 89) The law is sponsored by Rep. Carol Molnau (R-Chaska) and Sen. Dean Johnson (DFL-Willmar). Unless otherwise noted, provisions of the law are effective July 1, 2001. Here are some ofthe highlights. 2001 Special Session: HF7/SF7*/CH8 Transit funding, policy Several provisions in the bill will both aid transit operations and change the way plan-ning and budgeting will be conducted for fu-ture projects. The law includes $1 million in one-time appropriations from surplus funds in 2001 forboth rail service development and port devel-opment assistance grants. (Art. 1, Sec. 2) The Port of Minneapolis is also deemed a necessary element to the regional transporta-tion system. (Art. 2, Sec. 3) Though base funding in the law is signifi- cant, it is the policy constraints placed onfuture budgeting that make the most impact inthe law. In regard to light-rail transit, neither the com- missioner of transportation nor the Met Coun-cil will be allowed to spend state funds to studysuch projects unless it is specifically PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID The transportation funding law provides $3.5 billion in funding for the 2002-03 biennium, includingmoney for road construction projects.75Highlights NEW LAWS2001 appropriated in a law that identifies the route, including its beginning and end. (Art. 2, Sec. 53) State funds cannot be expended for com- muter rail, either unless the route is identified,under the law. (Art. 2, Sec. 58) Furthermore, the Metropolitan Council must keep separate line-items in its budgetingfor each light-rail transit line. In addition, the commissioner must notify legislative chairs of transportation committeeswhen funds are spent to study high-speed pas-senger rail service. (Art. 2, Sec. 54) The law also allows cities to establish quiet zones, where audible warnings \u2014 such as whistles and horns \u2014 may not be sounded. (Art. 2, Sec. 59). Under federal regulations,grade crossings in quiet zones must have spe-cial protection. In addition, the law changes the definition of a major transportation project from onethat has a cost of more than $5 million to anyproject that exceeds 25 percent of the annualconstruction program for department divi-sion or construction district in which the projectis located. (Art. 2, Sec. 55) Certain road authorities, including the trans- portation commissioner, as defined by the law,will be allowed to make fund advances to expe-dite development of inter-regional transpor-tation corridors. (Art. 2, Sec. 22) License tab shortfall Under the law, about $11.7 million in 2001 funds will be shifted from the general fund tothe highway user tax distribution fund to cover an unanticipated shortfall in vehicle registra-tion fees. In 2000, Gov. Jesse Ventura proposed a re- duction in fees as a result of a three-way budgetdeal that allowed the House, the Senate, andthe governor to each spend a chunk of thebudget as they saw fit. However, each year, when vehicle owners renew their registration there is a 10-day graceperiod beyond the month for renewal. Sincethe law took effect July 1, 2000, there was a 10- day span where owners attempted to cash in onfee reductions. Initially, the state required the owners to pay the previous fee. However, ultimately the statedecided to give all June renewals the reducedrate, causing a revenue shortfall. The money will reimburse that shortfall. (Art. 1, Sec. 12) Prompted in part by that situation, the law also requires that nearly 31 percent of sales taxcollected in fiscal year 2002 on the sale ofmotor vehicles be deposited in the highwayuser tax distribution fund, with the rest goingto the general fund. Beginning July 1, 2003,that percentage is raised to 32 percent for thehighway fund. (Art. 2, Sec. 64) Reducing, studying congestion Two specific provisions in the law address congestion issues in the Twin Cities metro-politan area. First, the law delays an improvement project on the Crosstown Highway 62 along the Min-neapolis/Richfield border until May 1, 2002. Aplanned project, which includes improvementsto the highway 's interchange with Interstate 35W, will take an estimated four years tocomplete. Officials were concerned with the conges- tion it will cause in conjunction with construc-tion on I-35W and I-494 in the south metro. The law requires also the Department of Transportation to conduct a study about con-gestion issues in the corridor. (Art. 2, Sec. 2) PHOTO BY ANDREW VON BANK The reconstruction of the Crosstown Highway 62/Interstate 35W interchange near the Minneapolis/Richfield border will be delayed at least one year as a study will look at the effect of increased traffic onnearby freeways, under the 2001 transportation/public safety funding law. PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID A study of the high-occupancy vehicle lanes along Interstate 394 and Interstate 35W in the Twin Citiesmetropolitan area is provided, under a new law. The study will focus on use and effectiveness of the HOVlanes in reducing congestion.76NEW LAWS2001Highlights In addition, the law calls for a study of high- occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes currently inuse on I-394 and I-35W south of Minneapolis.A $100,000 appropriation is provided to studywhether opening the lanes to all traffic willdecrease congestion. (Art. 1, Sec. 2) Metropolitan planning, growth The law also provides language restricting the ability of the Department of Transporta-tion or the Metropolitan Council from with-holding funds because of certain communitydevelopment issues. Under the law, the department and the coun- cil will not be allowed to refuse construction ofa project, or any other decision affecting de-sign, timing, or location, based on whetherthat community has enacted zoning ordinancesor housing density requirements that align orcontradict the department or council requests. The law does not affect ordinances or deter- minations that relate to access to a trunkhighway. However, the law imposes the same restric- tions on the council 's ability to distribute state and federal transportation funds. The language was prompted by situations where municipalities were either denied tran-sit and transportation funds or specific projectswere stalemated by the Met Council becausethe communities had not embraced thecouncil 's \"smart growth \" guidelines. (Art. 2, Sec. 4) Design-build The Department of Transportation has the option to develop construction plans on adesign-build basis, under the new law. (Art. 3,Secs. 1-10) Definitions and guidelines for design-build are laid out in the law, including requirementsfor when it may be allowed. Design-build allows projects to be designed as they go, rather than having to design theentire project before construction can begin.Officials expect the system will save time andmoney in the long run. The public interest must be served by a design-build contract under the new law. Inaddition, the Department of Transportationmust provide a written summary of its reason-ing for using design-build. The department must also approve any re- placement of personnel under contract andhas the authority to revoke a contract if re-placements are made without departmentapproval.Other policy provisions Bidders on state projects will now be able to file their documents electronically. Accordingto Molnau, the initiative will increase the effi-ciency of the bidding process and cut down onmistakes because bids with errors won 't be accepted by the computer. (Art. 2, Sec. 19) Lifetime registration is provided for trailers that weigh 3,000 pounds or less, under the law.The registration tax will be $55 for first timeregistrants and $25 for those currently regis-tered. Previous law required re-registration ev-ery two years. Owners may choose not to registerthe trailer at first, but all trailers must adhere to the law as of July 1, 2003. (Art. 2, Sec. 30) Also created in the law, is a tourism initiative through western Minnesota. The law establishes a \"King of Trails, \" a new designation for U.S. Highway 75 from its inter-section with the Canadian border in the north,all the way south to the Iowa border. Thehighway runs nearly parallel to the westernborder of the state. (Art. 2, Sec. 15) PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID Guidelines for identifying dangerous dogs were established by the 2001 Legislature, including theinsertion of a microchip in the dog for identification purposes. The provision, included in the omnibustransportation and public safety funding law, also allows for some dangerous dogs to be destroyed incertain situations.77Highlights NEW LAWS2001 Felony DWI Under the public safety portions of the law, a fourth drunken driving conviction within10 years will be considered a felony as of Aug.1, 2002. (Art. 11, Secs. 1-16) The measure provides funding for enforce- ment of the new penalty, including blood-alcohol concentration analysis. It providessome relief for probation and incarcerationcosts expected as a result of the new penalty. Italso increases the surcharge from $40 to $380over two years for someone to obtain a driver 's license after having it revoked following a pre-vious drunken driving conviction. A felony drunken driving conviction will carry a mandatory minimum sentence of threeyears in prison and up to a $14,000 fine. Suchoffenders will not have to spend more thanseven years in prison for a felony conviction,under the law. There is flexibility for judges tostay execution of the sentence, including themandatory sentence, in certain cases. Racial profiling The law also outlines anti-racial profiling efforts. It will require the state Board of PoliceOfficer Standards and Training (POST) to de-velop a model statewide racial profiling policyto be used by all state law enforcement agen-cies. In addition, it defines racial profiling asusing a person 's race, ethnicity or national origin as a reason for a traffic stop, rather thanthe behavior of a driver. Gathering of specific officer data is not man- datory, but data, such as date and time of thestop, race and gender of the driver, and reasonfor the stop, must be reported to the POSTboard if the agency agrees to take part in thestudy, receives a video camera for use in apolice car, or receives a grant to defray costs ofa study. In addition, each law enforcementagency must report the number of complaintsand the disposition of those complaints to thePOST board. An outside expert will be hired to conduct a statewide study of complaints, traffic stop dataand other information, under the new law. It willalso provide regional training seminars and in-service training opportunities for officers. Beyond that, the law provides about $4.3 million in funding for grants to agenciesthat adopt a racial profiling policy to purchasevideo camera equipment for patrol cars. And atoll-free line will be established by the stateattorney general 's office for people to call with racial profiling complaints. (Art. 7, Secs. 1-14)Harming animals, harmful animals Effective Aug. 1, 2001, the law establishes that harming a pet, companion, or service animal isa crime that would constitute a felony undercertain circumstances. (Art. 8, Secs. 5-10) It also establishes guidelines for identifying dangerous dogs, including allowing authori-ties to implant a microchip in the dog to iden-tify it. The law will allow for some dangerousdogs to be destroyed in certain situations. (Art.8, Secs. 11-22) New judges, salaries The law appropriates about $2.2 million during the biennium to fund five new judgesacross the state. Court system officials and judges testified before the Legislature that caseloads have in-creased significantly in past years to the pointwhere citizens are experiencing long delays asjudges juggle schedules. In addition, needs are expanding in several areas of the state experiencing populationbooms. Judges will be increased graduallythrough Jan. 1, 2003. (Art. 5, Sec. 1) Judicial salaries will also increase over the next few years, under the law. Judges will re-ceive a 6.5 percent raise effective July 1, 2001; a6.5 percent raise April 1, 2002; a 3 percentincrease Jan. 1, 2003; and a 3 percent increaseon Jan. 1, 2004. (Art. 5, Sec. 22) One other provision for judges allows them to sentence people convicted of domestic abusecrimes to a domestic abuse counseling PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID The omnibus transportation and public safety law appropriates money from the lottery prize fund for agrant to reconstruct Project Turnabout, a Granite Falls facility that deals with compulsive gambling. It wasdestroyed by a tornado that caused considerable damage in the west-central Minnesota town in July 2000.program. (Art. 10 Sec. 3) Disaster relief The city of Granite Falls will receive $3 mil- lion in 2002 to help assist with tornado-relatedcosts not covered by the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency. Granite Falls received significant damage when a tornado hit the west-central Minnesotatown in July 2000. (Art. 4, Sec. 10) In addition, $400,000 in flood relief grants will be available for the cities of Ada,Breckenridge, East Grand Forks, and Warren.(Art. 4, Sec. 10) Other criminal justice items The state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension will now require each police chief and sheriff tosubmit data regarding the number of applica-tions to obtain a concealed weapon permit,under the new law. The information is neededfor a study on how permits are granted andwhy they are denied. The data will include the number of applica- tions received, permits granted, reason givenfor seeking a permit, number of outstandingvalid permits for the agency, and specific rea-son a permit application was denied. (Art. 5,Sec. 20) Carlton County will receive a $300,000 re- imbursement from the state for outstandingcourt costs related to the Katie Poirier murderinvestigation and prosecution. About $10.5 million will be appropriated to78NEW LAWS2001Highlights the courts for mandated costs, included guard- ians ad litem for minors, court interpreters, certain civil hearings, and indigent client costs. The Department of Public Safety must con- vert three of its four combined hazardousmaterial/chemical assessment teams tostandalone chemical assessment teams, whichwill be stationed around the state. The oneremaining full service team will be located inSt. Paul. (Art. 4, Sec. 10) In 2002, $471,000 for grants to combat meth- amphetamine trafficking and manufacturing willbe available through the law. (Art. 4, Sec. 10) The law also provides funding for grants to help offset the costs of community orientedpolicing. The law appropriates another$500,000 in one-time funds for general grantsto be used for COPS overtime, financial crimeinvestigation, and the St. Paul neighborhoodHEAT enforcement program. Guidelines require that 50 percent must go to Minneapolis and St. Paul and the other50 percent to statewide law enforcement agen-cies, and local units of government must pro-vide a 25 percent non-state or in-kind fundmatch. (Art. 4, Sec. 10) Gov. Ventura vetoed additional grants for these programs from 2001 surplus funds. (Seerelated story, page 89) The law provides $150,000 for four law en- forcement agencies to develop pilot projectsfor handling mental illness calls. The plan willaward grants to projects that focus on reducingharm to people involved in the calls. (Art. 5,Sec. 15) Effective Aug. 1, 2001, it will be a gross misdemeanor or felony to possess shopliftinggear or to manufacture fraudulent identifica-tion cards. (Art. 8, Sec. 26-28) Ted Foss Highway Interstate Highway 90 from its intersection with Trunk Highway 74 in Winona County tothe Wisconsin border will be designated \"State Trooper Theodore 'Ted' Foss Memorial High- way, \" under a law effective Aug. 1, 2001. The commissioner of transportation will be required to place appropriate signage markingthe highway. The funds for those signs willcome from private sources. Foss, a corporal with the Minnesota State Patrol, was killed Aug. 31, 2000 by a semi-tractor trailer that crashed into his squad carparked along the interstate near Lewiston. Fosswas making a traffic stop at the time. He diedat the scene, and four occupants of the stoppedvehicle were injured.The truck driver was found to not be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, but wascharged with reckless and inattentive driving. The House version was sponsored by Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove). Sen. Leo Foley(DFL-Coon Rapids) sponsored the law in theSenate. HF2161/SF2005*/CH113 Verifying bus drivers' licenses School districts, nonpublic schools, or pri- vate contractors will be required to annuallyverify the validity of driver 's licenses of each person who transports students, under a newlaw effective Aug. 1, 2001. The schools, districts, and companies may use the National Drivers Register or the De-partment of Public Safety to perform theverification. The National Driver Register is a computer- ized database of information about driverswho have had their licenses revoked or sus-pended, or who have been convicted of suchserious traffic violations as driving while im-paired by alcohol or drugs. The register ismaintained by the National Highway TrafficSafety Administration, a division of the U.S.Department of Transportation. Currently, all 50 states supply the register with information. In addition, all states canaccess information in the database electroni-cally. Federal law allows states the option ofusing the system for verifying drivers ' creden- tials. There are also regulations regarding states ' responsibilities to inform drivers when theregister is used as a basis for denying or revok-ing a license. Government entities can use the system to avoid granting drivers and other licenses topeople convicted of offenses that may legallydisqualify them from lawfully driving. Rep. Tom Workman (R-Chanhassen) spon- sored the measure in the House and Sen. JulieSabo (DFL-Mpls) sponsored it in the Senate. HF1172/SF1056*/CH98 Disabled accessibility A new law effective Aug. 1, 2001 will redefine \"small vehicle passenger service \" to include 15-passenger vans with a wheelchair lift andthe equipment to secure at least three wheel-chairs. Under previous law, only vehicles large enough to carry seven passengers were consid-ered small. The change in definition appliesonly to vehicles in the Twin Cities metropoli- tan area. Rep. Tom Workman (R-Chanhassen), who sponsored the measure in the House, said thechange in law would improve services for dis-abled Metro Mobility users by allowing privatetaxi companies to operate vehicles able to ac-commodate wheelchairs. \"The rider pays a little more, but the service improves dramatically, \" he said. The new law also will allow the Metropoli- tan Council, which owns and operates MetroTransit and Metro Mobility vehicles, to trans-fer ownership of previously used vehicles totaxi companies. However, the new law stipu-lates that only those companies licensed in acity whose taxi licensing requires criminal back-ground checks, annual driving record checksfor drivers, and annual vehicle inspections maypurchase the used vehicles. Workman said theextra protection is aimed to guarantee thesecurity and safety of disabled passengers. Sen. Satveer Chaudhary (DFL-Fridley) spon- sored the measure in the Senate. HF1596*/SF1599/CH112 Maintaining riverway infrastructure A resolution that urges authorization of funding for improvement and rehabilitationof inland waterways will be sent to PresidentBush and other federal office holders, includ-ing Minnesota 's senators and representatives serving in Congress. Rep. Tom Workman (R-Chanhassen) spon- sored the measure in the House, which neitherappropriates state money nor changes statelaw. It does encourage Congress to spend mil-lions of dollars on updating the \"Upper Missis- sippi River System. \" The resolution: supports Minnesota 's pro-rata participation in funding new construction at the Sault Ste.Marie Lock; recognizes the importance of river transpor- tation to Minnesota 's agriculture and economy; acknowledges the need for restoration and rehabilitation of critical habitat in the UpperMississippi River basin; and urges Congress to authorize funding to im- prove the efficiency of river transportationand to restore the ecological values of theUpper Mississippi River.The resolution also states that \"the Legisla- ture supports continued funding of the PortDevelopment Assistance Program in recogni-tion of the essential and fundamental79Highlights NEW LAWS2001 contribution the Great Lakes and inland wa- terway transportation systems make toMinnesota 's economy. \" In addition, the resolution indicates that the Legislature recognizes habitat restoration andrehabilitation needs on the river and the im-portance of waterways transportation to stateagriculture and the economy as a whole. According to the resolution, water trans- portation is the most efficient means of trans-porting bulk goods, such as petroleum, coaland farm products, all of which are essentialcomponents of commerce and are importantto the state and local economies. Most of the current lock-and-dam system is more than 60 years old and in need of repair.According to the National Corn Growers As-sociation, lock delays in the Upper Mississippicost U.S. farmers and businesses an average of$94 million per year. River barges are efficient at carrying bulk commodities. One barge can carry as much as58 large semi trucks, according to the IowaDepartment of Transportation. Fifteen-bargetows, a common configuration, are more than1,100 feet long. Farmers told legislators this session they want to move their grain in a more efficientand environmentally friendly way. To that end,they would like some of the locks and damsextended from 600 feet to 1,200 feet to accom-modate larger tows. Wear and tear on the river from barge traffic was of concern to some testifiers during the2001 session. Language supporting environ-mental rehabilitation was inserted into theresolution in support of that concern. Sen. Steve Dille (R-Dassel) sponsored the resolution in the Senate. HF208*/SF551/R4 Trackless trolleys, 'mountain' drives Drivers will no longer be required to honk their horns within 200 feet of a curve whendriving on a mountain highway in Minnesota. Surprised that drivers ever had to do such a thing in the first place? The 1937 Legislatureenacted the provision, which will now be re-pealed as one of many so-called obsolete lawspinpointed by lawmakers during the 2001session. The new repealer law will also eliminate references to trackless trolleys, defined as \"a vehicle that draws power from overhead wiresbut does not run on rails. \" Among the repealed references to trackless trolleys in statute were provisions requiringthe drivers to immediately stop the trolleyclear of any intersection and keep the doors and gates closed when an authorized emer-gency vehicle approached. There was also a reference in the section of law prohibiting a person from hitching a to-boggan, hand sled, bicycle, or other similardevice onto a trackless trolley. The new law also repeals a section of state law prohibiting a person from owning or oper-ating a coach or vehicle carrying passengersfrom employing a driver who is addicted to theexcessive use of intoxicating liquors. That 1913 law stipulated a fine of up to $50 in addition to being liable for all damagessustained by a violation of the law. Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville) and Sen. Dean Johnson (DFL-Willmar) were thesponsors. The new law is effective Aug. 1, 2001.HF37/SF480*/CH24 Clarification legislation A new law aims to clarify many portions of legislation relating to transportation. Among other changes, the measure will change the state 's mechanism for protecting roads in winter. Previously, drivers were per-mitted to exceed seasonal weight limits by10 percent between Jan. 1 and March 7. Theincreased weight limits are allowed becausetemperatures below freezing harden highwaysub-bases. Effective Aug. 1, 2001, the commissioner of transportation will set variable dates for differ-ent regions of the state based on \"a freezing model index \" that takes into account regional climatic and soil differences. Although the is-sue of weight limit variances can be controver-sial, pitting farmers against those who main-tain rural roads, this particular change gar-nered no opposition. The law will also allow the commissioner to increase the speed limit to 55 mph in workzones on divided highways. Previously themaximum was 40 mph. New legislation will also allow the transfer of jurisdiction over several state highways to CrowWing, Ramsey, and Washington counties,along with the city of Brainerd through whichthe roads travel. It will also abolish the state Transportation Regulation Board and transfers certain respon-sibilities relating to motor or common railcarriers from the board to the commissioner.It further modifies or eliminates some formerduties of the commissioner in relation to com-mon carriers.Along those lines, the legislation repeals a requirement that truckers report to the com-missioner recorded business information, suchas rate schedules, charges, and weight rules.They must still report accidents, wrecks, orcasualties. Rep. Tom Workman (R-Chanhassen), who sponsored the measure in the House, said thelegal change concluded the dismantling of theTransportation Regulation Board that beganin 1996. Furthermore, the law will allow the trans- portation commissioner to require a contrac-tor to hire a certain percentage of workers fora contract in a designated taconite tax reliefarea as defined by state statute whose principalplace of residence is in the area surroundingthe project. Sen. Mark Ourada (R-Buffalo) sponsored the measure in the Senate. HF1488/SF1769*/CH213 Width restrictions for RVs A new law effective Aug. 1, 2001 will redefine the maximum legal width of recreationalvehicles. Previous law limited the total outside width of a vehicle to 102 inches, just short of nine feet.The new law will specify that the 102-inch limitwill not include attachments that do not ex-tend beyond the width of the vehicle 's rearview mirror if the recreational vehicle is self-pro-pelled, or beyond the width of the rearviewmirror on the towing vehicle if a trailer is beingtowed. The new law makes no changes to an exist- ing provision giving municipal trucks bearingsewage sludge immunity from the widthrestriction. Additionally, the new law declares that mo- tor homes may not be longer than 45 feet.Motor homes are defined in existing law as aunit meant to provide temporary living quar-ters permanently attached to a vehicle. Thegeneral length limit for single-unit vehicles is40 feet. Rep. Tom Workman (R-Chanhassen) spon- sored the law in the House, and Sen. KeithLangseth (DFL-Glyndon) sponsored the mea-sure in the Senate. HF1085/SF1155*/CH8380NEW LAWS2001Highlights Old St. Anne's Pass A state highway 55 bridge over the Soo Line Railroad right-of-way in Stearns County willbe renamed \"Old St. Anne 's Pass, \" under a new law signed by Gov. Jesse Ventura. Rep. Doug Stang (R-Cold Spring) spon- sored the law in the House. A constituentsuggested the name for the bridge because itrestored access to a road leading to St. Anne 's Cemetery in Maine Prairie Township. The cem-etery was previously made inaccessible by con-struction of a railroad line. Eeffective Aug. 1, 2001, the law will also require the commissioner of transportation toadopt a suitable marking design and erect ap-propriate signs subject to the law that requiresthe cost of such signs to be paid from non-statesources. St. Anne was the mother of Mary, who gave birth to Christ, according to traditions in theRoman Catholic Church.

Jesse Ventura will prohibit the construction of billboards alongthe C. Elmer Anderson Memorial Highway inCrow Wing County. Rep. Stephen Wenzel (DFL-Little Falls) was the House sponsor of the measure, which aimsto protect what he described as the \"spectacu- lar beauty around \" Trunk Highway 371, named after Anderson who served as Minnesota 's gov- ernor from 1951-1955. Wenzel recalled riding on the newly com- pleted road (the Brainerd bypass betweenBaxter and Barrows) through the forest areawith Anderson 's family. \"Everybody had the same thought: it 's beautiful, and we should keep it that way, \" he said. After the road opened in July 2000, Wenzel announced support foran initiative to prohibit commercial signagealong the road. Among signs banned are those primarily intended to advertise, inform, and attract at-tention of people in a motor vehicle. However,a few markers are allowed: directional and other official signs, public utility signs, adver-tising for sale or lease of property on which thesign is located, and signs for the name of abusiness or person living on the property. Sen. Don Samuelson (DFL-Brainerd) spon- sored the measure in the Senate. It is effectiveMay 16, 2001. HF1549/SF1772*/CH103 Light restrictions A new law signed by Gov. Jesse Ventura will now exempt farm implements from a state lawthat requires towed vehicles be equipped witha red tail lamp light \"plainly visible from a distance of 500 feet to the rear. \" The law is effective April 25, 2001.Sponsored by Rep. William Kuisle (R- Rochester) and Sen. Dean Johnson (DFL-Willmar), the new law clarifies previous lan-guage so that certain farm implements neednot use the lights. Such implements are thosetowed slower than 30 miles per hour, display-ing a slow-moving vehicle emblem, and com-plying with the law requiring the last unit on acombination of implements of husbandry toshow red reflectors to the rear. It also makes clarifying changes on types of vehicles that must be equipped with two taillamps mounted on the rear. Kuisle said the Minnesota Crop Production Retailers suggested the law in response to lawenforcement officers ' new interpretation of law regarding towed vehicles. He explainedthat slow-moving farm implements are notnormally thought to need rear-mounted redlights because the towing vehicle 's lights are visible. HF1404/SF1709*/CH43 Handlebar height unrestricted A new law effective Aug. 1, 2001 will repeal a section of state law regarding motorcycles. The law, sponsored in the House by Rep. Tom Workman (R-Chanhassen), removesfrom statute a provision that makes it illegal tooperate a motorcycle with handlebars extend-ing above the operator 's shoulders when the operator is seated with both feet on the ground. The law, supported by motorcycling organi- zations, eliminates old regulations that wereunnecessary and inconsistent with the safeoverall behavior of motorcyclists, Workmansaid.

The money from the accounts not kept on hand will be deposited into the state treasuryfor investment by the State Board of Invest-ment. The interest is credited to the VeteransHome Board to use at its discretion for thegeneral benefit of the residents.

HF1248*/SF1774/CH11181Highlights NEW LAWS2001 Honoring wounded warriors Beginning this year, Aug. 7 will be desig- nated as Combat Wounded Veterans Day,under a new law. The day will honor military veterans who were wounded while serving the United Statesin the armed forces and whose sacrifices haveentitled them to a Purple Heart Decoration. The law stipulates that each year the gover- nor shall issue a proclamation honoring theobservance. According to Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL- Roseville), the House sponsor of the measure,Aug. 7 was selected because it was the datePresident George Washington awarded thenation 's first Purple Hearts. In 1782 Washington awarded three soldiers the honor which he designed, created, andcalled the Badge of Military Merit. After theRevolutionary War no other soldiers receivedthe badge until it was revived and renamed thePurple Heart by the United States War Depart-ment in 1932. The Senate sponsor was Sen.

Under the measure effective Aug. 1, 2001, the State Board of Investment is required tomaintain records of all gifts received, clearlyshowing the identity of the donor, the purposeof the donation and ultimate disposition of thedonation. Rep. Rob Eastlund (R-Isanti) said he spon- sored the measure on behalf of the Depart-ment of Veterans Affairs. He said the law isintended to provide better accountability andoversight of the donations. The new law will require that the donations be invested by the State Board of Investmentunder the same guidelines that the board makesits other investments, and that donations arecredited to the Minnesota Veterans Home en-dowment, bequest, and devises fund. The legislation will also require the dona- tions be \"expended or used by the board as nearly in accordance with the condition of thegift or donation as is compatible with the bestinterests of the residents of the homes. \" Eastlund said that in addition to a monetary donation, an example of a gift to a veteran 's home would be a television donated by a VFW. Sen. Cal Larson (R-Fergus Falls) was the Senate sponsor.

Jesse Ventura's veto of a bill that would have allowed contrac-tors to seek recovery of costs on public con-tracts where delays are caused by the publicentity failed shortly before the House adjournedMay 21. The vote was 70-63. The bill would have allowed contractors to seek recovery for costs or damages, or seek anequitable adjustment for delays or disruptionscaused by acts of the public entity. Rep. James Clark (R-New Ulm) said the bill came as a result of instances such as one thatinvolved a construction company that was todeliver fill but had the delivery substantiallydelayed by a Metropolitan Airports Commis-sion decision to install a traffic light. Clark said the company went to the com- mission to renegotiate a change in the contractdue to the delay but was given no flexibility inthe time of delivery clause. In his veto message, Ventura wrote that the \"no damage for delay\" clause is commonlyused in public works contracts and the legisla-tion would lead to increased litigation andhigher contract costs. Rep. Bernie Lieder (DFL-Crookston) said during debate that contractors already havethe right to seek redress for damages caused bya public entity through the court system. The Senate voted to override the veto by a 63-1 margin with Sen. Bob Lessard(I-Int'l Falls) being the lone dissenter. The bill originally passed both houses with unanimous votes. Sen. David Knutson (R-Burnsville) was the Senate sponsor. HF2074/SF2031*/CH126Full VetoesGovernor vetoes 14 bills Editor's Note: A total of 218 bills and five resolutions reached the governor's desk duringthe 2001 Legislative Session. During the SpecialSession, 13 more bills went to the governor forapproval. The governor vetoed 11 bills and line-item vetoed appropriations from five more measures. The summaries in this section give brief de- scriptions of each bill vetoed and some of thereasons for the governor's actions. The governor also vetoed a special session bill intended to keep government operating if all theother bills had not been signed before July 1,2001. That bill contains mostly technical lan-guage and was not summarized. The bills are divided into two categories: full vetoes and line-item vetoes. Within the twocategories, the bills are arranged alphabeticallyby topic. Once a bill has passed both the House and the Senate in identical form, it is sent to the gover-nor. The governor has several options whenconsidering a bill. The governor can: sign the billand it will become law; veto the bill; or line-itemveto individual items within an appropriationsbill. During the first year of the biennium the governor has three days from the time of \"pre-sentment\" to veto a bill. If the governor does notsign the bill within this time frame, it willbecome law without his signature. (Sundays arenot counted in the three-day time limit, butholidays are.) For bills passed during the last three days of the second year of a biennium (even-numberedyears), however, the governor has 14 days from\"presentment\" during which he can use his vetoauthority. If the governor takes no action on abill during this time, the bill is vetoed in what iscalled a \"pocket veto.\" These same rules governspecial session bills. Vetoed bills are returned to the body of origin, and the House and Senate may attempt tooverride. A two-thirds vote in each house isneeded to override a veto (90 votes in the Houseand 45 votes in the Senate). The governor can exercise line-item veto au- thority on appropriations bills only. This optionallows the governor to eliminate appropriationitems to which he or she objects. As with allvetoes, the governor must include a statementlisting the reasons for the line-item veto with thereturned bill. A specific listing of the sections of bills that were line-item vetoed is included in the Sum-mary section, which begins on page XX. The governor's veto authority is outlined in the Minnesota Constitution. (Art. IV, Sec. 23)CHILDREN# Early childhood, family education Gov. Jesse Ventura vetoed funding for early childhood and family education programs, thelast bill passed by the Legislature during itsregular session. The family and early childhood education funding bill passed the House by a party line69-65 vote two minutes before the constitu-tional deadline for the Legislature to adjournMay 21. Within those two minutes, the Senatepassed the bill 47-18. The conference commit- tee had agreed to a deal at about 10:15 p.m. In his veto message, Ventura said he would not sign any appropriations bills before a tax billwas approved. He also criticized the speed withwhich both bodies considered the measure. \"The haste with which this agreement was rushed through \u2014 without time for even cur-sory review \u2014 resulted in numerous technicalerrors and omissions,\" Ventura wrote. The bill contained the same $544 million general fund spending target as was in theoriginal House proposal. Much of the committee discussion centered on $9 million of the state's Temporary Assis-tance for Needy Families (TANF) funds in thebill. Ultimately all monies went to childcare viathe Basic Sliding Fee. Among other highlights of the bill were: a $5 million increase toward the community education levy; an anticipated $4 increase per child in rev- enue for early childhood and family educa-tion (ECFE) programs; head Start and childcare assistance funding would have continued at current law levels;and after-school enrichment grants were funded at base levels.Excluded from the bill was a guaranteed subsidy for childcare workers whose wage fallsbelow a certain income level. \"A key early childhood initiative, forecasted consolidation of childcare programs, was notincluded in the conference report, althoughboth the House and Senate bills included con-solidation,\" the governor wrote. \"I still believethat consolidation is an important reform tosupport low-income working families.\" Conferees said there was not enough money to support the governor's initiative this year.During deliberations, members said they wouldconsider a similar plan in future years.

Jesse Ventura. \"While I support their intentions, we must also recognize that changes to the healthcaresystem do not come free, \" Ventura wrote in his veto message, acknowledging the bill was theresult of two years of negotiations. Among many changes, the bill would have required certain civil penalties for violations oflaws governing health plans. In addition, thosepenalties would have been shared 50-50 be-tween the health carrier and the policy holders.Health plans would not have been allowed toexclude or reduce coverage for a person cov-ered by the plan whose health care needs arosefrom a suicide attempt. In addition, continuity of care would have had to be provided in specified circumstancesfor up to 120 days for people changing healthplans, which Ventura addressed in hismessage. The bill would have also established require- ments under which health plan companiesmust grant enrollees mandatory standing re-ferrals to specialists. The measure was sponsored by Rep. Kevin Goodno (R-Moorhead) and Sen. Linda Berglin(DFL-Mpls). \"The portion of the bill relating to the con- tinuity of care and standing referrals will in-crease costs not only for the private sector butfor the public sector as well. Unfortunately, thepublic sector costs have not been fully recog-nized, \" Ventura stated. \"I believe if policy changes are made, the costs of those changesmust be funded. \" Lawmakers acknowledged the governor 's concerns, adjusted the bill 's provisions, and amended it to the omnibus health and humanservices bill. The governor signed that bill intolaw after a special session was convened. HF560/SF491*/CH196 HIGHER EDUCATION# Employee status remains same Gov. Jesse Ventura vetoed a bill that would have transferred several Minnesota State Col-leges and Universities employees from unclas-sified to classified positions. The bill would have provided that MnSCU employees represented by the Minnesota As-sociation of Professional Employees bargain-ing unit other than customized trainers be24 hours before it could be performed. Ventura vetoed a similar provision in the 2000 sessionand had promised a veto should the omnibusbill include the measure. Ventura claimed that tucking policy into omnibus bills was an abuse of the legislativeprocess and a move he would not support. \"I believe that no issue is so important that it justifies risking the integrity of the legislativeprocess, \" Ventura said in a statement accom- panying his veto message. The bill (HF1832/SF2361*) would have pro- vided $6.3 billion in general fund spending forhealth and human services programs, includ-ing the Minnesota Family Investment Pro-gram and other health entitlements. Another significant part of the bill included several changes to current health- and humanservices-related issues. The bill would have provided for: reform of long-term care, reflecting a shift to more home-based services; funding mental health issues such as civil commitment and suicide prevention; alternatives for children with autism; \"unlocking \" the waiting list for people with developmental disabilities; and decreasing health disparities. Members in both the House and Senate had lengthy debate involving funds for teen preg-nancy prevention. In the House debate,$5 million per year was moved from teen preg-nancy programs to welfare-to-work initiativesin the vetoed bill. The bill also contained a change to the state 's immunization schedule. The provision wouldhave allowed the commissioner of health tomake changes to the schedule while the Legis-lature was not in session only if recommendedby all three of the following: the U.S. PublicHealth Service, the American Academy of Pe-diatrics, and the American Academy of FamilyPhysicians. The changes would have had tohave been reported to and reviewed by theLegislature at its next session. Many of the provisions in the omnibus bill were attached to a different bill (HF1381/SF1397*), sponsored by Rep. Tim Wilkin (R-Eagan). A conference committee did not re-solve the differences between the House andSenate versions. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Kevin Goodno (R-Moorhead) and Sen. Linda Berglin(DFL-Mpls).

Those employees enjoy cer-tain protections such as not being able to befired without just cause. Unclassified positions can be established and filled without following all the regulations thatapply to classified positions. They also do notenjoy the same kind of bargained protection. The bill would have added approximately 400 employees to classified service. Officials from MnSCU testified against the measure saying it had been before the Legisla-ture the past two sessions and that the unclas-sified status of positions such as registrars andadmission officers allowed the colleges greaterflexibility in hiring. In his veto message Ventura wrote that the labor management issues involved were bestaddressed through the collective bargainingprocess. Rep. Mike Osskopp (R-Lake City) and Sen. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope) were thesponsors. HF1569*/SF1628/CH218 Edvest program vetoed Gov. Jesse Ventura vetoed a bill that would have changed provisions for the state 's Edvest program. It was his first veto of the 2001session. The Minnesota College Savings Plan, for- merly known as Edvest, allows accounts to becreated for a designated beneficiary who willattend college in the future. Families with anincome of $80,000 or less are eligible to receiveup to 15 percent \u2014 maximum of $300 \u2014 of their contribution in the form of a state grant. Sponsored by Rep. Rob Eastlund (R-Isanti), the measure would have extended the time foradopting rules for the Edvest savings programby nine months. The program cannot beginoperation until the rules are adopted. The Senate sponsor was Sen. John Hottinger (DFL-Mankato). The original 18-month provision for begin- ning the program expired in 1999 as officialsfrom the Minnesota Higher Education Ser-vices Office were working on aspects of theprogram and overlooked the time enactmentclause. \"I want to emphasize that my veto relates to the process, not the policy, \" Ventura wrote in his veto message. \"I do support the implemen- tation of the Edvest program and its excellent88NEW LAWS2001Vetoes Restrictions vetoed Gov. Jesse Ventura vetoed a bill May 17 that would have prohibited a resident from usingdirt bikes on their property. If approved, the proposal would have al- lowed the city of Edina to impose restrictionson the operation of recreational motor ve-hicles on property owned by the operator if theproperty is three or fewer acres in area. Rep. Ron Erhardt (R-Edina), the House sponsor of the measure, said he brought thelegislation forward on behalf of residents wholived next to a person who had built an elabo-rate dirt bike track in his backyard for his sonsto use. David Velde, Edina 's city sanitarian, told a House committee this session that because thenoise level wasn 't constant, the city determined its existing nuisance ordinances did not apply. Barbara Zell, who lives next to the house with the track, testified at the same hearing thatthe activities of the residential neighborhoodwere being interrupted not only by the noiseinvolved but also by clouds of dust that blewover the fence into her yard. In his veto message, Ventura wrote that laws should not be \"capriciously enacted \" that re- strict people from doing as they want on theirown land. He was also concerned the law wasgiving one community authority to restrict ahomeowner 's property rights without looking at whether other communities would supportthe same type legislation.goal of encouraging and supporting saving for higher education. However, I believe the pro-gram should begin as soon as possible. Ratherthan extending rule-making authority for upto nine months, I encourage the Legislature totake the steps necessary for immediate imple-mentation prior to the adjournment of thisyear's legislative session. \" Ventura expressed concern that annual ap- propriations of $1.5 million to the generalfund have been cancelled for three years, andthere are no assurances this year 's appropria- tion will be used. \"I appreciate and share the Legislature 's sup- port for this program and encourage expeditedlegislative action so this savings plan can beginthis spring, \" Ventura wrote. The House later amended the policy lan- guage for the Edvest program into the omni-bus higher education finance measure. Whenthe Legislature adjourned May 21, that bill wasunresolved in a conference committee. HF550*/SF954/CH58 LOCAL GOVERNMENT# Requirement needed Gov. Jesse Ventura vetoed a bill that would have exempted some local government build-ing projects from a requirement to employ anarchitect or engineer. The bill would have allowed a person other than an architect to plan, design, or supervisethe construction of certain buildings costingless than $50,000 that are owned by a govern-mental unit. Non-institutional or non-assembly building would still have been sub-ject to all requirements of the state buildingand fire codes. Rep. Richard Mulder (R-Ivanhoe) and Sen. Arlene Lesewski (R-Marshall) sponsored themeasure on behalf of officials from LincolnCounty who expressed concern over the costsof hiring an architect in connection with build-ing a garage facility. The bill would have also required the BoardLAW# Evidence change vetoed Gov. Jesse Ventura vetoed a bill that would have made changes to rules governing the de-livery of evidence in medical malpractice casesand would have dealt with two statute of limi-tation issues. Under existing law, plaintiffs in medical malpractice cases must include in their com-plaints an affidavit that a medical expert hasconcluded the defending physician or physi-cians injured the plaintiff by deviating fromthe normal standard of care. The plaintiff 's attorney must submit a summary of the evi-dence to be given by the plaintiff 's expert within 180 days of the malpractice suit being filed. Rep. Steve Smith (R-Mound), the House sponsor of the measure, said he offered the billto protect the plaintiff 's affidavits from being dismissed under what he characterized as \"a too strict civil procedure \" rule. \"I understand that there is a developing practice among medi-cal malpractice defense attorneys to move todismiss otherwise legitimate complaints \" on the grounds that minor technical errors hadbeen made in the affidavit, he said. The bill would have allowed plaintiffs to clean up minor errors in affidavits without fearof a judge granting a motion to dismiss nearthe end of the 180-day window. Smith saidallowing the extra time for plaintiffs to fix theircomplaints is \"a much better practice in deal- ing with human suffering. \" Ventura vetoed the bill in opposition to an amendment made on the Senate floor thataddressed a separate issue specifying that a1999 extension of the medical malpractice stat-ute of limitation should apply retroactively.The amendment would have revived cases thathad expired before the 1999 change was made.In his veto message Ventura wrote, \"The amendment is very controversial and has sig-nificant ramifications within the medical, le-gal, and insurance industries. \" Sen. Thomas Neuville (R-Northfield), the Senate sponsor, said attorneys representingboth defendants and plaintiffs had agreed to astatute of limitations change in a 1999 law,which has an effect on the vetoed language. Arecent state court of appeals decision ruled thelegislative intent was not to make the statute oflimitations adjustment retroactive for casesthat had expired. The 1999 change specified that plaintiffs could bring medical malpractice suits up tofour years after the act of malpractice. Finally, the bill would have clarified the applicable limitation period if a doctor weresued for causing death by malpractice. Thiswould have corrected a gap erroneously left byfailure to make a technical amendment whenthe 1999 malpractice limitation period law wasenacted.

Under existing law there are exemptions to when a licensed architect is required on gov-ernmental building projects. In his veto mes-sage, Ventura wrote the current exemptionsare based on square footage and occupancy ofthe buildings, not the costs involved. He wrotethat a building project may cost less than$50,000 yet \"the life-safety impact dictates the need to use an architect or engineer. \" Ventura also expressed concern that the study required under the measure containedno funding provision and that the board esti-mated the cost for the study would be around$27,000.

Jesse Ventura 's veto of a bill that would have ex- panded state Department of Public Serviceauthority over utilities using railroad rights-of-way. The motion to override Ventura 's veto of the bill was defeated 83-49 May 21. Votes to overridevetoes require a two-thirds majority. The Senateoverrode the veto 62-2 earlier in the day. Sponsored by Rep. Tom Workman (R- Chanhassen) and Sen. Steve Murphy (DFL-Red Wing), the bill would have expanded par-ticular department authority over regulationof phone, cable, fiber optic, and other telecom-munications wires. Currently, such authorityexists only over electric wires and natural gaslines. During House debate Workman described rail lines as \"the Great Wall of China \" that prevent the expansion of telecommunicationlines in rural areas. Answering concerns thatthe bill could interfere with important trans-portation projects, he said it was not intendedto affect light-rail transit. The provision was originally intended to improve telecommunication access in GreaterMinnesota, Workman said. During debate, Rep. Bernie Lieder (DFL- Crookston) expressed the concern of severallegislators that, although the bill did not ex-plicitly mention light rail, \"perhaps there are some problems \" or unintended consequences. Rep. Jean Wagenius (DFL-Mpls) said, \"Thanks, governor, for the veto. \" In his veto message to legislative leaders, Ventura wrote that the bill would create \"a property right for the telecommunications orcable company in the state 's rail bank right of way and may require the state to pay for futurerelocation of those utility or phone lines. Thiscost is not provided for. \" He concluded that his veto would \"protect the rail bank right of way for future uses andfrom unanticipated costs. \" HF1817/SF1821*/CH122TRANSPORTATION# CRIME# DEVELOPMENT#Vetoes for COPS, HEAT grants Gov.

Jesse Ventura used his veto power to eliminate $1 million in funding fora St. Paul project. \"I am vetoing the $1 million appropriation to the St. Paul Port Authority for acquisition of theTrillium site in the city of Saint Paul, \" Ventura wrote in his veto message. \"This project was not pre-approved by all parties involved in negotiat-ing a final agreement on the bill, and is not anemergency item. \" Ventura was referring to a \"global agree- ment \" reached by the House, Senate, and the governor 's office near the end of the 2001 special session to settle all remaining budgetitems. The 38-acre Trillium site between Inter- state 35E and Jackson Street, south of Mary-land Avenue is part of a planned Trout BrookGreenway system. Proponents say the TroutBrook Greenway plan provides a new oppor-tunity to expose some of Trout Brook andrestore some wetland areas. The property has never been developed, and residents have long considered it a naturalbuffer from the industry in their area. Thespace will also be used to connect the area tothe lower Phalen Greenway to the south alongthe Mississippi River. Rep. Jim Knoblach (R-St. Cloud) and Sen.

The funds would have been divided up so that 50 percent went to St. Paul and Minne-apolis, and the other 50 percent went to otherMinnesota municipalities. The veto does not affect further appropria- tions for such programs during the 2002-03biennium. The new law also appropriates an-other $500,000 in one-time funds for generalgrants. The grants may be used for the following purposes and conditions: police officer overtime; creation of a financial crime investigative task force; HEAT targeted law enforcement strategy in St. Paul; and local units of government must provide a 25 percent non-state or in-kind fund match.These grants are also subject to the 50/50 split between Minneapolis/St. Paul and otherstate municipalities. During the session, groups appeared before the House Judiciary Finance Committee to askfor help in funding COPS, the federal commu-nity-oriented policing program, officer over-time, and HEAT, a law-enforcement strategyproposed in St. Paul during the summermonths. The HEAT program proposal, sponsored by Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul), wouldspecifically have helped that city crackdown ona chronic prostitution problem in the city 's Frogtown neighborhood. Dawkins testified thatprevious efforts to increase police presence inthe neighborhood during warmer monthsshowed dramatic results in reducing prostitu-tion activity.

He indicated the site shouldenter the competitive process for fundingthrough the Department of Trade and Eco-nomic Development. Koochiching County will not receive a $50,000 appropriation for concept develop-ment of the Big Bear Country Education Cen-ter because Ventura said the project is a capitalproject that should be submitted through thebonding process. A $150,000 appropriation to local govern- ments to plan and promote the 2004 GrandExcursion was also red-lined. The proposedproject is to promote tourism in a particularregion. Ventura 's veto message said the proposal did not demonstrate a higher value than theother tourism expenditures it would replace. Additionally, a $100,000 appropriation to remodel a building in an Albert Lea industrialpark was vetoed because it had no statewidesignificance. Finally a $200,000 one-time appropriation to the State Board of Investment to pay staff costsrelated to an investment program for Minnesotabased start-up businesses was vetoed becausethe implementing legislation was not enacted. 2001 Special Session: HF5*/SF12/CH4GOVERNMENT# Local funding crunched While millions of dollars in the state govern- ment finance appropriations bill were allo-cated to public broadcasting and the salaries offour constitutional officers, three local appro-priations were line-item vetoed by Gov.

The governorindicated in his veto message it \"is a local project that should be funded locally. \" Ventura also vetoed rider language associ- ated with a 2000 appropriation to the GuthrieTheatre for its new Minneapolis location. Therider would have allowed the theater to use theappropriation for pre-design and design func-tion, which were not authorized under theprevious law. The $3 million appropriation in2000 was designated to acquire and prepare asite. Three appropriations to the Amateur Sports Commission were also cut: a $475,000 appro-priation for making matching grants for after-school enrichment grants; a $25,000 grant tothe Range Recreation Civic Center for ableacher purchase; and a $100,000 one-timegrant for operation of a shooting sports pro-gram to train participants and coaches in shoot-ing sports that are Olympic events. In his veto message, Ventura wrote that these appropriations support programs thatare local in nature and any state involvementwould more appropriately be considered aspart of the capital budget. The state government funding law was spon- sored by Rep. Phil Krinkie (R-Shoreview) Paul). 2001 Special Session: HF9/SF9*/CH10 ENVIRONMENT# Environmental projects cut Gov. Jesse Ventura used his veto authority to cut three projects totaling $780,000 fromthe 2001 omnibus environment, natural re-sources, and agriculture finance package thatprovides $1.2 billion in overall spending forthose functions. Gone from the measure is a $50,000 appro- priation to the city of Taylor 's Falls for fire and rescue operations in support of Interstate StatePark.\"No other local unit of government receives special funding in this bill for basic local ser-vices provided to state recreation facilities, andit is inappropriate to provide special treatmentin this case, \" Ventura wrote in his veto mes- sage. \"Existing payments-in-lieu of taxes and various forms of general-purpose state aid tolocal governments are the appropriate mecha-nism to compensate local units of governmentfor services to state facilities. \" The two other provisions that did not make it past the governor 's desk would have appro- priated $455,000 to the University of Minne-sota to complete production on \"Uncommon Ground, \" a televised film series on the history of Minnesota 's natural landscapes, and an- other $275,000 to the university to develop\"green \" infrastructure design strategies for public works projects. Both of these projects had been given the green light by the Legislative Commission onMinnesota Resources (LCMR), a 20-memberpanel of House and Senate members who rec-ommend special environmental projects tothe Legislature. While the governor did notindicate specific objections to the two univer-sity projects, he was critical of the overall LCMRselection process. \"Instead of developing a limited, strategic agenda to improve natural resources in Min-nesota, the commission has chosen to try toprovide something for everyone, \" he wrote. \"It is my hope that the administration can workwith the commission over the next year todevelop a more focused and strategic approachto using the scarce resources available. \" Ventura also found fault with the way lottery-in-lieu-of-sales-tax dollars were spentin the bill. Last year, the Legislature granted anew funding source for various environmentand natural resources functions \u2014 including the Department of Natural Resources, Metro-politan Council, and Como and Minnesotazoos \u2014 in the form of a 6.5 percent in-lieu sales tax on lottery tickets. Previously, this moneywent to the general fund.

Yes, no, not yet for biodiesel A biodiesel mandate that once was part of an omnibus agriculture measure tanked duringthe waning hours of the regular session andwas not revived in the new omnibus environ-ment, natural resources, and agriculture lawpassed during the special session. Biodiesel is a blend of traditional diesel fuel and biodegradable combustible liquid fuelmade of organic oils. Soybeans provide thebiological component in 90 percent of biodiesel,according to the National Biodiesel Board. Although they differed in scope, both the House and the Senate passed omnibus agricul-tural initiatives containing some sort ofbiodiesel requirement. The last offer, a combi-nation of both plans adopted initially by theconference committee, would have requiredthat by 2002 all state-owned and operated diesel vehicles use a biodiesel blend and by2003 all diesel fuel sold in Minnesota wouldcontain at least 2 percent biological material byvolume. While the Senate accepted the omnibus ag- riculture proposal with these provisions, theHouse sent it back to conference committee.The bill as it re-emerged did not contain anybiodiesel requirement. Along with opposition to biodiesel, many legislators objected to unrelated provisions thatwould have allowed counties to offer bountieson coyotes. Soybean farmers and other proponents touted the mandated use of the fuel as a way toimprove air quality and jump start the state'srural economy. But opponents, including trucking, railroad, and airline representatives, maintained thatthe mechanics of biodiesel use in combustionengines has been insufficiently tested. Thetransportation industry and others questioneda public policy they said would force them tobuy fuel in other states and ultimately increasefuel costs for consumers. Before being rolled into the omnibus pro- posals, the biodiesel legislation was sponsored Rep.Tim Finseth (R-Angus) and Sen. Steve Murphy(DFL-Red Wing). HF1547/SF1495Supporters of a plan requiring that a percentage of all diesel fuel sold in Minnesota contain at least2 percent biological matter by July 2003 said it would benefit the state's soybean farmers. Soybeansprovide 90 percent of the biological component of biodiesel fuel.PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID Got a control board? An effort to create a milk price control board failed to pass the House Commerce, Jobs andEconomic Development Committee and stalledin the Senate Taxes Committee in 2001. Sponsored by Mary Ellen Otremba (DFL- Long Prairie) and Sen. Becky Lourey (DFL-Kerrick), the board would have had authorityto require milk processors in Minnesota, whopurchase raw milk from farmers, to pay apremium price above the federally mandatedprice. The federal government currently regulates milk prices via the U.S. Department of Agri-culture (USDA) Federal Milk Marketing Or-der program, under which farmers producingmilk in certain states are guaranteed a mini-mum price for that milk. The program datesback to the 1920s, when dairy processing andtransportation technology necessitated federalintervention to assure a consistently safe andaffordable supply of milk nationwide. According to the USDA Web site, the milk marketing program protects both farmers andconsumers by legally mandating a minimumprice that milk processors, such as cheese orbutter manufacturers, must pay farmers formilk. Consumers are protected from \"wild fluc- tuations in price through periods of heavy andlight milk production\" by ensuring that farm-ers will have a reliable source of income. Like-wise, farmers are insulated from economic orenvironmental variables beyond their control. Critics now claim that the system is out- dated and is inconsistent with technologicaladvances and economic conditions that per-mit the production and processing of milk in AGRICULTURE#92NEW LAWS2001Bills in Limbo almost any region. For example, the milk market-ing program has alwaysdetermined the price ofmilk by calculating a givenarea's distance from Eau Claire, Wis., which wasonce the center of Ameri-can dairy production. The farther from Eau Claire, the higher the pricea farmer was guaranteed.The program was success-ful in encouraging fledg-ling local dairies to sup-port large populations farfrom Wisconsin. Now,milk can be produced any-where and consumed any-where else. Yet, accordingto the nonpartisan HouseResearch Department, therestrictions remain salientlargely because of thestrong political power ofdairy producers outsidethe Upper Midwest. Otremba told the House Civil Law Commit-tee that five other states,including Wisconsin, havesimilar boards, and thather bill is based on a simi-lar panel in Montana. Under the bill, the gov- ernor would appoint fivemembers, none of whomcould be \"connected in any way with the produc-tion, processing, distribu-tion, or wholesale or retail sale of milk or dairyproducts. \" In addition to setting milk prices guaranteed to farmers, the board could institute a quotasystem limiting the growth in the quantity ofmilk that any farmer could produce. Produc-ers could sell, barter, or otherwise exchangethe quotas that would permit the productionof only as much milk as was being producedwhen the quotas were set.

Sykora said the bill is a \"responsible pro- posal. \" The provisions in the bill are legal in 33 other states, she said, including Wisconsin,Iowa, and South Dakota. \"If youth access would increase dramatically due to wine being sold ingrocery stores, why haven 't these other states changed their law back? \" Further restrictions on the sale of wine in grocery stores would have included identifica-tion checks on every purchase by a clerk age 18or older, annual compliance checks, and atheft management program in every store.

Goodno testified to the House Crime Pre- vention Committee that \"more than 300 stud- ies show that most drivers are impaired at .08. \" To back up the claim, Goodno played a video-taped experiment in which a small number ofMinnesotans drank until their limit reached.08 and then drove. All participants, includingone liquor store owner who initially expressedopposition to .08, had significant difficultynavigating a driving course and expressed sup-port for lowering the legal limit. Statistically, a 130-pound woman could ex- pect to have a .08 concentration about twohours after drinking three \"standard drinks, \" a measure equivalent to a five-ounce glass ofwine, 12 ounces of beer, or 1.5 ounces of80-proof liquor, about the potency of vodka. A175-pound man could drink about five drinksin the same amount of time. Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul) explained that \"President Bush and Congress have all expressed support for (.08). \" Congress has made some federal highway funding depen-dant upon state adoption of the .08 limit. Opponents to .08 have expressed concern that the measure would unreasonably targetsocial drinkers and not repeat offenders. How-ever, Lynne Goughler, legislative chair of theMinnesota chapter of Mothers Against DrunkDriving (MADD), said \"any reasonable per- son knows that the law will not affect socialdrinkers. \" Goodno also assured members that both social drinkers and full-blown alcoholics eachexperience the same limit, although their bod-ies respond differently. As such, drinkers wouldstill have to be pulled over, likely for unsafe orerratic driving, before police would administertests. Kenn Rockler, a lobbyist for the Wine, Beer & Spirits Association of Minnesota, arguedthat no data conclusively demonstrated thatlowering the legal blood-alcohol limit savedthe lives of drivers who had been drinking. HF51/SF118 Profile of Learning unchanged Although legislators ultimately did nothing about eliminating or revising the Profile ofLearning in 2001, members of the House Edu-cation Policy Committee tried to revampMinnesota 's graduation standards.Testimony by students and parents prompted lawmakers to take another look atchanging the Profile. But it was not to be thissession. Rep. Tony Kielkucki (R-Lester Prairie) and Sen. Warren Limmer (R-Maple Grove) spon-sored a bill that proposed to repeal the Profileof Learning and establish new statewide tests inthird, fifth, and 10th grades; annual testing inother grades was optional. The measure was included in the House 's version of the K-12 omnibus funding bill butdid not receive Senate approval. Barbara Cook Smith, a witness who testified before the House Education Policy Commit-tee, saw a \"strong difference \" in what her sec- ond child was bringing home compared towhat her older child had for homework beforethe Profile. The content, she said, was endlesslyrepeated questions. \"There was no testing, just a check-off list of what they had learned, \" said Cook Smith, par- ent of students attending Southwest HighSchool in Minneapolis and former PTA presi-dent. \"Learning had become secondary to pro- cessing paperwork. \" Rep. Paul Marquart (DFL-Dilworth) ques- tioned Kielkucki 's bill, wondering how stu- dent success would be measured without theProfile. Kielkucki said he is taking a different ap- proach by allowing teachers to decide what 's best rather than creating a mandate for everyclassroom. \"I really have a problem putting every stu- dent through the same loophole, \" he said. \"I think the system is ultimately flawed. We needto let every district make up its mind. \" Another bill (HF2064/SF1947) sponsored by Rep. Mark Buesgens (R-Jordan) and Sen.Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope), would estab-lish a task force to work with the Council forBasic Education to create new standards inEnglish, math, science, history, and geogra-phy. It also did not receive Senate approval andwas not included in the K-12 spending law. HF2057/SF2089 Board of Education on hold Two years after the state Board of Education was abolished by the Legislature, two bills fromthe House of Representatives proposed to re-instate the supervisory board. However, nei-ther was included in the final K-12 omnibusbill. Those bills would have also renamed the state 's education department now called theDepartment of Children, Families and Learn- ing, because many find that designationconfusing. The first bill, sponsored by Rep. Lyndon Carlson (DFL-Crystal) and Sen. Ann H. Rest(DFL-New Hope), would appoint 12 citizensto the board \u2014 at least one of whom must reside in each congressional district \u2014 plus the chancellor of the Minnesota State Colleges andUniversities and the president of the Univer-sity of Minnesota. The bill requires at least four of the citizen members to have previously served as a localschool board member. The governor wouldappoint the resident citizens with the recom-mendation of the Senate. Board memberswould be prohibited from holding public of-fice or being employed by any board of educa-tion or school district, public or private duringtheir tenure. The plan would give the board \"the author- ity to exercise general supervision over educa-tional agencies and adopt or amend adminis-trative rules. \" Furthermore, the Revisor of Stat- utes, in consultation with House and Senatecounsel, would transfer back certain other ad-ministrative powers to the board, and preparea report for the 2002 Legislature to showchanges. The provision would have been effective Dec. 1, 2001. HF770/SF710 Another plan, sponsored by Rep. Mark Buesgens (R-Jordan), would create a state su-perintendent of public instruction, replacingthe commissioner of education. The superin-tendent would hold a four-year term in a non-partisan position, and be elected during thestate 's general election. Under the bill, the board would be com- posed of eight elected citizens, one from eachcongressional district. The board would havegeneral supervision \"over educational agen- cies and other education-related matters. \" Members would have the same conflict of in-terest restrictions as those under Carlson 's bill, and would serve staggered four-year terms. The bill 's rulemaking provisions say the board \"may adopt new rules and amend any of its existing rules under legislative authority. \" Consistent with statutory provisions that gov-erned the repealed state Board of Education,the bill also would permit the board to grant alocal school district a rule variance for \"imple- menting experimental programs in learning orschool management. \" The provisions would be effective Jan. 1, 2003. HF881/SFnone94NEW LAWS2001Bills in Limbo Allowing religious references Under a measure passed by the House, stu- dents would have the opportunity to read andstudy historical documents that contain reli-gious references without academic penalty. But the bill would advance no further dur- ing 2001, because it had no Senate companion. Current law does not prohibit students from studying America 's founding documents, but bill sponsor Rep. Mark Olson (R-Big Lake)said some students, teachers, and school ad-ministrators have been penalized for usingcurriculum that contained religious references. \"While these things are permitted, I hear from students and teachers that they are not, \" Olson replied. For instance, he said instead ofreciting the Pledge of Allegiance, some teach-ers recite a \"pledge to the earth. \" The bill reads, \"Districts may not limit or restrain instruction in American or Minnesotastate history or heritage based on religiousreferences in documents, writing, speeches,proclamations, or records. \" It adds, \"These and any other materials must be used for edu-cational purposes and not to establish anyreligion. \" \"I don 't see that there is a problem in our classrooms relative to teaching American his-tory, \" said Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) during debate. Olson replied that textbooks\"do not teach the whole story, \" and noted the PARTIAL PLEDGE PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID A plan to have public and charter school students recite the Pledge of Allegiance at least once per week gained approval from the House, but not the Senate. The plan (HF915/SF303) was sponsoredby Rep. George Cassell and Sen. Bob Kierlin. bill does not require that subjects be taught inany particular way. HF1028/SFnone Gifted and talented funding A plan to give gifted and talented programs across the state ongoing state funding was notincluded in the final K-12 education fundingbill. Currently, a district may allocate its own revenue or apply for grants to fund gifted andtalented programs, but few exist in the state.Legislation sponsored by Rep. Connie Bernardy(DFL-Fridley) would cost around $10 millionannually and would be effective in the 2001-2002 school year and later. \"It is simply a program designed to encour- age students to reach the extents of their ownpotential \u2014 and it is disheartening to see any program which encourages such positiveideals diminished due to inadequate funding, \" said Aly Richey, a junior at Spring Lake ParkHigh School, who has participated in giftedand talented programs for nine years. Aly tes-tified in favor of the proposal before a Housecommittee during 2001. According to the bill, funding must be used for identifying gifted and talented students;providing educational programming for thosestudents; and providing staff development to aid in the teaching such students. Bernardy said each district would decide which schools would receive funding for theprograms. Sen. Jane Krentz (DFL-May Township) sponsored the legislation in that body. HF216/SF1091 Truancy prevention Since he retired from a long teaching career, Rep. Lyndon Carlson (DFL-Crystal) has beenasked how things have changed over time inthe classroom. Most changes were positive, hesaid, but there were also problems, mainlyrelating to attendance and mobility. The number of students who were frequently absent was minimal in Carlson 's early years of teaching, he said. In his last year, however, hisattendance book was scattered with absencesand excuses. Combining his own experience with the find- ings of a statewide study on truancy, Carlsonsponsored a bill during 2001 that would at-tempt to reduce truancy by helping schools setattendance goals and providing financial in-centives for schools to meet those objectives.The proposal was not part of the K-12 omni-bus funding bill. His proposal required school districts to set at least a 95 percent student attendance goal forsecondary schools and 97 percent attendancefor elementary schools. Under the bill, school districts would be required to issue an initial report of districttruancy goals, as well as current truancy ratesto the Department of Children, Families andLearning. Annual reports on the outcomes oftruancy reduction efforts would also be sub-mitted to the department. The bill would cost about $8.2 million in each year of the 2002-03 biennium. Schooldistricts would receive an additional 4 percentof the district 's base compensatory revenue only if district truancy goals are met. (Compensatory revenue is a portion of school 's general education funding. The rev- enue is based on the number of students whoare eligible for free and reduced price meals.) Truancy revenue issued to schools would be over and above funds a district already spendson truancy prevention measures. Under the bill, programs to reduce truancy may include \"parental involvement programs, programs designed to increase personal con-tact with students and family, and95Bills in Limbo NEW LAWS2001 ELECTIONS#collaborative activities with other schools or with social service and law enforcement agen-cies providing truancy reduction activities. \" Stephanie Autumn, staff member at the Council on Crime and Justice, said she has seenthe same results in years of work with truants.Autumn said the American Indian commu-nity has the lowest high school graduation rateand subsequently the highest dropout rate.However, she said, the problem starts longbefore high school. \"We're losing children before they get to middle school, \" Autumn said. She cited pov- erty, violence, and homelessness as reasons fortruancy. \"When they drop out of school they also drop out of the community and into the justicesystem, \" Autumn said. \"We need to be making our schools community-based schools. \" Sen. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope) spon- sored the bill in the Senate, where it stalled incommittee. HF2376/SF1936 No redistricting agreement After much debate during the 2001 session, the House and Senate were unable to come toan agreement on redistricting plans to decidehow the state 's political boundaries will be mapped out for the next decade. The House congressional plan, sponsored by Rep. Erik Paulsen (R-Eden Prairie), wouldcombine the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paulinto one congressional district, and create asingle district across much of the northern partof the state. The bill passed the House by a party line vote of 69-61. Paulsen said at the core of the bill is the principle found in Minnesota 's Constitution that districts be of equal population. He said the bill takes into account the demo- graphic shifts that have occurred in Minnesotaduring the past 10 years as 45 percent of thestate 's population now lives in the suburban Twin Cities metropolitan area. Using numbers from the 2000 census, the bill would establish seven congressional dis-tricts with the same population of 614,935.The eighth district would have one less person.The legislative districts would have more de-viation, ranging from 36,452 people to 36,984. The newly created fifth congressional dis- trict incorporating Minneapolis and St. Paulwould have a minority population of 30.8 percent. The House legislative district plan would create six districts in which current DFL legis-lators would run against each other, one dis-trict in which two Republican House memberswould be matched up, and eight districts whereDFL and Republican incumbents would be inthe same district. The Senate plan, sponsored by Sen. Lawrence Pogemiller (DFL-Mpls), would keep Minne-apolis and St. Paul in separate congressionaldistricts. There would be four metropolitanand four rural congressional districts underthe measure. The bill passed the Senate on a partisan 35- 28 vote. Under the proposal, the minority popula- tion of the new fourth congressional districtwould be 22.6 percent compared to the7.6 percent provided in the House plan, andthe new fifth district 's minority population would be 28.5 percent in the Senate bill versus30.8 percent in the House bill. The Senate plan reflects a structure more like the current fourth and fifth congressionaldistricts, which represent St. Paul and Minne-apolis respectively. The Senate bill would create 11 state House and Senate districts where Republican incum-bents would run against each other, one dis-trict in which two DFL incumbents would betogether, and eight districts in which incum-bents from the two parties would face-off. A conference committee was appointed but never met. Smile for your ballot A measure that would require voters to show picture identification before voting was passedby the House but did not receive a hearing inthe Senate. Minnesota Secretary of State Mary Kiffmeyer told the election subcommittee of the HouseGovernmental Operations and Veterans Af-fairs Policy that since the 2000 election she hasheard from \"an overwhelming \" number of citizens concerned with the integrity ofMinnesota 's voting systems. Kiffmeyer said many people were surprised to discover the state doesn 't require a person to show any identification at the polling placebefore voting. Although the state traditionally has one of the nation 's highest voter turnouts, Kiffmeyer said she has heard from many of those thatdon't vote because they think the system needs reform. \"The biggest controversy is that just any- body could walk in and claim a name, \" she PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY ANDREW VON BANK A plan to have voters present a picture identification, such as a driver's license, before receiving a ballot was discussed but not enacted during the 2001 Legislative session.By law, redistricting plans must be in place 25 weeks before the state primary. Thus thelegislative and congressional districts must bedetermined by March 19, 2002 in order forcandidates to know the districts in which theywill file. If the Legislature is unable to agree toa plan, or the agreed upon plan is challengedon issues such as the constitutionality of theplan, it is likely the matter would end up beingdecided by the courts. HF2516/SF237796NEW LAWS2001Bills in Limbo said. \"There has been a tremendous shaking of the general confidence in the system. \" A measure that Rep. Tony Kielkucki (R- Lester Prairie) said he was carrying onKiffmeyer 's behalf would require voters to present picture identification at the pollingplace before receiving a ballot. Kielkucki said picture identification cards have become \"a part of life \" and pointed out that one is needed before boarding an airplaneor cashing a check. He said requiring identifi-cation before voting would bring integrity intothe process. The bill would allow voters who do not have a form of identification to vote by signing anaffidavit at the polling place. Minnesota is one of the few states to allow registration on Election Day. To do so, a po-tential voter has to show a prescribed pictureidentification (generally a driver 's license or state identification card). If the address on theidentification is not current, state law allows anumber of documents, such as a current utilitybill, to verify the address of the person. Current law also allows a person who does not have the proper identifying documenta-tion to bring in a person who lives in the sameprecinct who can verify or \"vouch \" that the wannabe voter also lives in the precinct. Opponents of the measure said there is no tangible proof of election fraud in the state andrequiring picture identification would ad-versely affect participation by those who donot have identification cards and would berequired to purchase some form just to vote. The Senate companion was sponsored by Sen. Warren Limmer (R-Maple Grove). HF857/SF1103 ETHICS#GAME & FISH# Outside office limitations With the demise of the Xtreme Football League, it is unclear whether lawmakers willcontinue to discuss whether the governorshould be allowed to take outsideemployment. During the 2001 session, a House commit- tee approved a bill that would have establishedthat the state 's constitutional officers are sub- ject to the code of ethics that prohibits stateemployees from using their position for per-sonal gain. It was also inserted in the omnibus state government finance bill that passed the Housebefore the Legislature adjourned its regular session. But that provision was later removed before conferees brought the bill back to both theHouse and Senate for reconsideration in thespecial session. As a result, questions remainwhether the six constitutional officers \u2014 the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary ofstate, state auditor, state treasurer, and attor-ney general \u2014 are indeed \"state employees. \" Alan Gilbert, chief deputy and solicitor gen- eral from the Attorney General 's Office, issued an opinion in response to an inquiry by SenateMajority Leader Roger Moe (DFL-Erskine)that determined the governor is an employeeof the state and thus bound by the state code ofethics. But Julien Carter, the commissioner of the Department of Employee Relations, later ruledVentura 's XFL announcing job was not a con- flict of interest with his state duties because thestatute is confusing and contains ambiguouslanguage. Sponsored by Rep. Philip Krinkie (R- Shoreview), the original legislation to clarifythat ambiguity would have prohibited the con-stitutional officers from engaging in outsideactivities for which the officer provides per-sonal, professional, or other services and re-ceives pay. Krinkie later offered an amendment, that a House committee approved, that would createa \"presumption of a conflict of interest \" in income-earning outside activities. Under the measure, it is presumed that out- side income-earning activities are a conflict ofinterest with official duties unless the officialcan demonstrate otherwise in a hearing. Krinkie said the bill would clarify that the state 's constitutional officers are on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. The amended bill would establish the chief administrative law judge as the person respon-sible for determining whether an activity is aconflict of interest. Under the original bill, the state 's attorney general would have that duty and the governorwould be entrusted with determining conflictof interest charges against the attorney general. That provision led to a concern there might be a potential for political fighting between thetwo elected officials. There was no action in the Senate on the measure. HF111/SFnoneLegal limit limbo A bill that was designed to be a strong deter- rent to people who intentionally defy huntingand angling limit laws was shot down once onthe House floor, but remains alive through aprocedural move that sent the bill back to theHouse Environment and Natural ResourcesPolicy committee. Sponsored by Rep. Bill Haas (R-Champlin), the bill would have increased penalties forgross violations of the state 's game and fish laws. Although its status is in limbo, it wasn 't for lack of committee action. The bill made threestops in the environment policy committeeand met scrutiny under six other House com-mittees along the way. The final version of the bill would have instituted three degrees of penalties foroverlimit offenses based on current restitutionvalues of fish and game. All would be consid-ered gross misdemeanors. It would have authorized Department of Natu- ral Resources (DNR) conservation officers toseize all vehicles and equipment used in first-and second-degree gross overlimit violations.And it would have required the immediate sei-zure of the offender 's game or fish license if the restitution value was above $500. License revo-cations would have been subject to varyinglengths of time based on the degree of the of-fense. First-degree violations would have calledfor a 10-year license revocation after conviction. The bill also included separate provisions to address limit offenses by commercial andaquatic licensees and specified the rights of allviolators for a judicial review process. The impetus for the bill came from several fishing roundtable discussions around the stateand a legislatively mandated DNR report ontakings of game and fish beyond the legal limit. The department brought their report and recommendations for increased penalties tothe House Environment and Natural ResourcesPolicy Committee in January, presenting pho-tographic evidence of some of the more fla-grant overlimit violations, including 12 deertaken by three hunters, 186 walleye taken byone angler, and 360 sunfish taken by another. \"Violations of hunting and angling laws impact fish and wildlife management efforts aswell as public perceptions and support forhunting and angling activities, \" the report reads. Revocation and suspension of license privi- leges would be the best deterrent, according tothe DNR.97Bills in Limbo NEW LAWS2001 The bill 's supporters argued that current law amounts to a slap on the wrist; some violatorscome prepared to pay fines on the spot, theysaid. Generally, licenses are only revoked forone year following a second violation within athree-year period. The opposition said they feared the bill would give conservation officers too much authority.Their testimony often conjured up images ofofficers randomly searching people 's freezers for excess fish or venison. The Senate companion sponsored by Sen. Jane Krentz (DFL-May Township) stalled inthe Senate Environment and Natural ResourcesCommittee. HF94/SF222 GOVERNMENT# HIGHER EDUCATION#Agenda reversal A bill that would rearrange the timing of when the Legislature does its work passed theHouse but stalled in the Senate. Sponsored by House Majority Leader Tim Pawlenty (R-Eagan), the bill would change thebudgeting process. Under the current systemthe Legislature does most of its budget workduring the odd-numbered year of the session.The bill devotes odd-numbered years to orga-nizational sessions not to exceed 30 days, andeven-numbered years to budgeting. Even-numbered years are also election years.Pawlenty said the bill could lead to a more citizen-based Legislature that the current sys-tem discourages because of its prohibitiveschedule. He said the bill would also allow newmembers to better understand the budgetingprocess before they have to make decisions inthe even-numbered years. The bill would still allow the governor to call the Legislature into special session. In addi-tion, the leaders from both the House andSenate can call an odd-year special session, ora two-thirds majority vote of each house of theLegislature could reconvene the regular ses-sion during an odd-year. Dean Barkley, head of the Minnesota Plan- ning agency, said Gov. Jesse Ventura supportsthe proposal because the current system hasstrayed from the intent of the constitutionalamendment approved by voters in 1972 thatled to annual sessions. At that time, Barkley said, meeting every year was supposed to provide more in-depthstudy of issues, prevent the logjam of activity atthe end of session, and avoid expensive specialsessions.As originally introduced, Pawlenty 's bill would have required the Legislature to get thebulk of its work done in the odd-numberedyears. The bill would have allowed the Legisla-ture to meet up to 14 days during even-num-bered years to deal with budget deficits. Rep. Mike Osskopp (R-Lake City) said it did not make sense for legislators to get all thework done in the five months following theelection and then have nothing else to do forthe next 17 months. Osskopp offered a successful amendment in the House Governmental Operations and Vet-erans Affairs Policy Committee that switchedthe two years around. The House passed the bill late in the session, and Pawlenty said the measure might be dis-cussed again soon. \"This sends a signal to the Senate that we are serious (about reform), \" he said. \"Hopefully they 'll engage us in discussion over the interim. \" The Senate sponsor was Sen. Dave Kleis (R-St. Cloud). HF2205/SF2073 Tech center request Wanting a place to teach lifelong learning skills, leaders of two Minnesota schools soughtlegislative help during the 2001 session. Fergus Falls Community College and the Fergus Falls school district sought $80,000 infiscal year 2002 via a grant from the MinnesotaState Colleges and Universities Board of Trust-ees. The state would have appropriated themoney to the board from the general fund. The plan, sponsored by Rep. Bud Nornes (R-Fergus Falls), was not included in the highereducation omnibus bill. The funds would be used to plan and imple- ment pilot programs in a combined vocationaltraining center of the college and school dis-trict. The two entities would operate thecenter. Monies would be spent between a facility use study, curriculum development, computerconnections between the college and schooldistrict, and a pilot program to begin in the fall.The bill specifies the appropriation would beavailable until the end of the 2002-03biennium. High school juniors would be the minimum age eligible to participate in the program. KenPeeders, president of Fergus Falls CommunityCollege, said students could potentially be readyto go to work after high school or pursue an advanced degree at a MnSCU two- or four-year institution. \"There are some real oppor- tunities for economic development, \" he said. Bob Duncan, Fergus Falls school district superintendent, told the committee \"We are looking to salvage opportunities for students.This is a win-win for our high school and ourgraduates in this area. \" Sen. Cal Larson (R-Fergus Falls) sponsored the measure in the Senate, where it awaits acommittee hearing. HF2371/SF2245 Paying your own way Students wishing to retake a college class may someday have to do so with their ownmoney \u2014 but not yet. A plan sponsored by Rep. William Kuisle (R-Rochester) that would provide a tuitionpolicy for the University of Minnesota and theMinnesota State Colleges and Universities re-garding students retaking classes was not in-cluded in the higher education omnibus bill. \"If a student wants to retake a course the state should contribute zero to the class, \" he told the House Higher Education FinanceCommittee. The policy would be enacted for students who retake a class after previously attaining apassing grade, or for those who drop a class inthe final three weeks of the term. Kuisle said the bill would give the institu- tions the option of setting up a policy forextenuating circumstances, such as health is-sues or being called for active military duty. The proposal would affect a handful of students. Peter Zetterberg, director of institutional research and reporting at the University ofMinnesota, said about 535,000 credit hourswere taught in fall 2000 at the Twin Citiescampus, with about 5,200 students dropping aclass in the final three weeks. \"I believe the same (percentages) are true at our Crookston, Duluth and Morris campuses, \" he said. Of those students retaking classes \u2014about 1,000 per semester \u2014 Zetterberg said most are enrolled in lower division math, chemistry, orphysics courses where a grade of C or better isneeded for their major. He said 75 percent ofstudents achieve the needed grade the secondtime around. Patrick Opatz, budget director for MnSCU, said system-wide numbers indicate less than1 percent of students withdraw in the last two98NEW LAWS2001Bills in Limbo LAW#INDUSTRY#weeks and less than 2 percent retake a course. MnSCU students are enrolled in about 537,000credit hours per term. HF751/SFnone Camp funding A plan that would allocate state funds to expose middle school age girls to certain careerpossibilities was not included in the highereducation omnibus bill. And the fact that the program wasn 't funded could mean it runs out of money in 2003. Sponsored by Rep. George Cassell (R-Alex- andria) and Sen. Cal Larson (R-Fergus Falls),the bill seeks $30,000 in both 2002 and 2003 fora Science Technology and Engineering Pre-view Summer Camp for Girls at AlexandriaTechnical College. It was included in the Sen-ate higher education bill, but not the Housemeasure. The one-week camp exposes girls entering seventh grade to the possibilities of a career ina technical field. The goal is to interest themearly enough so the girls take the proper mathand science classes in middle and high school,which in turn prepares them to enter andsucceed in college level programs, such asengineering. Stephanie Maras, assistant camp coordina- tor, told the House Higher Education FinanceCommittee that 152 girls from around thestate took part in the July 2000 inaugural event,divided over four weeks, and that the camp canaccommodate 160 campers. \"We expect a waiting list this year, \" she said. Tuition is free, and Maras said some girls wereonly able to participate because of no fee. The 2000 camp cost $93,392 to operate, and was funded by seed money from private dona-tions designed to get the camp started, includ-ing more than $56,000 from the Society ofManufacturing Engineers Education Founda-tion through a grant provided by the BushFoundation. However, Maras said that grantwill be reduced to 50 percent in 2001, 25 per-cent in 2002 and zero in 2003. She said camp leaders have pursued other funding sources, but have found some Minne-sota companies aren 't willing to contribute because they do not have any operations in theAlexandria area. HF1414/SF1254Telecommunications reform stalls A telecommunications reform proposal the Ventura Administration believes would pro-vide better rates and more services for Minne-sota consumers \u2014 residential and business, urban and rural has been put on hold for at least another year. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Ken Wolf (R- Burnsville) and Sen. Steve Kelley (DFL-Hopkins), never left the House Regulated In-dustries Committee or the Senate Telecom-munications, Energy, and UtilitiesCommittee. The proposal calls for standard statewide service, affordable local phone service, ad-vanced services to anywhere in the state, andfor consumers to be able to choose their ownprovider. \"Telecommunications would be driven not by the whims of a monopoly, but by a vibrantcompetitive marketplace, \" said Anthony Mendoza, Department of Commerce deputycommissioner. The main initiative of the bill would require local service providers to adhere to \"universal service, \" or meet certain standards of telecom- munications service. With universal service,hidden subsidies \u2014 access charges and rate averaging \u2014 that currently exist in phone bills would be replaced, in large part, with explicitmechanisms. For the benefit of small telephone compa- nies that have relied on these access charges,the new plan attempts to provide a soft landingby reducing the charges gradually over a five-year period. Reduced access charges wouldalso decrease the costs of long-distance calls. Rate averaging would be the second hidden subsidy to be eliminated, under the plan. Whenrates area averaged under a monopolistic mar-ket, urban consumers help ease the cost torural consumers, because the cost of service ismuch higher in non-metro areas. Under the proposed plan, consumers above the average rate, generally rural consumers,would receive a subsidy to bring the cost downto the average rate consumers in the state arepaying. The subsidy would come from a \"universal service fund, \" which would be funded by a new 5 percent excise tax on any telecommunica-tions service \u2014 including long-distance calls and wireless services. The fund would be cre-ated by the bill. The universal service fund would also pay for a list of \"essential services, \" some thatconsumers currently receive, and others that will be needed more and more as technologychanges. They include: low-income assistance; touch-tone; i.e., tracing calls); access to operator services; access to directory assistance; and toll-free Internet access. HF510/SF554 Concealed carry falls short A bill that would have required local officials to grant handgun permits to qualified appli-cants unless there were a compelling reason todeny the request passed the House but failed inthe Senate. Under the bill, sponsored by Rep. Lynda Boudreau (R-Faribault) and Sen. Pat Pariseau(R-Farmington), county sheriffs would havebeen required to issue a concealed weaponpermit within 15 days of an application unlessthe applicant failed a background check or didnot pass several other conditions in the bill. In addition to making Minnesota a \"shall issue \" state regarding the granting of applica- tions, the bill would clarify requirements forapplicants. Under the bill, successful appli-cants would be at least 21 years old, havesuccessfully completed a training course ordemonstrated experience, not have been con-victed of a felony, and not be listed in the statecriminal gang registry. Sheriffs would be for-bidden from considering any other informa-tion and would be required to explain in writ-ing a decision to deny a request. Under current law, both sheriffs and police chiefs have the discretionary authority to granthandgun permits only to those who demon-strate \"an occupation or personal safety haz- ard\" that would necessitate being armed. Bill sponsors argued that current law \"is unfair and discriminatory \" because local offi- cials hold discretionary authority to arbitrarilydeny permits. Boudreau said the bill \"does not change current handgun restrictions, onlychanges the permit process. \" Critics charged that the bill would increase the availability of handguns among technicallyqualified but still dangerous people. Opponents of the bill included Dr. Kathy Sweetman, president of the Minnesota Acad-emy of Pediatrics. She told the House Crime99Bills in Limbo NEW LAWS2001 LOCAL GOVERNMENT#Prevention Committee that the number of \"suicides, homicides, and accidental deaths (by handguns) is 40 times higher than (thenumber of times a gun is used) in self-de-fense. \" She added that the \"best way to protect children is to remove guns from individualsand communities. \" After passing the House 85-46 April 9, the plan failed in the Senate 40-23 April 11. HF1360/SF1395 Tort reform tabled A bill that would have modified the state 's civil law restitution system passed the Housebut never won Senate committee approval. Sponsored by Rep. Dave Bishop (R- Rochester), the bill would have modified thesystem of joint and several liability, whichpermits courts to hold defendants in civil ac-tions responsible for a greater share of aplaintiff 's cost than the proportion of damage for which they are responsible. Such plans are known as \"tort reform \" be- cause they amend the civil law system used tocompensate those injured by the actions ofothers. A tort is defined as \"a private or civil wrong, other than a breach of contract, forwhich the court will provide a remedy in theform of an action for damages. \" Under the bill, defendants found liable for 40 percent or less of the damages in a civil casewould have been responsible for only the per-centage of the plaintiff 's damage that is pro- portional to the defendant 's percentage at fault. Current law sets that proportion at 15 percent.Shooting range change A bill that would prohibit local units of government from shutting down shootingranges as nuisances passed the House but awaits action in the Senate. Sponsored by Rep. Tom Hackbarth (R- Cedar), the bill would prohibit local govern-ments from closing shooting ranges that are incompliance with law at the time of their estab-lishment even if the range is later found not toconform to a new ordinance. Hackbarth said some local units of govern- ment are using nuisance laws as an excuse toshut down shooting ranges. \"A lot of shooting ranges in Minnesota are being shut down for frivolous reasons, \" Hackbarth said. He said ranges are important for safety rea- sons as they teach young hunters how to shoot.Without the ranges, Hackbarth said, there couldbe an increase in hunting accidents involvingfirearms. Currently, there are approximately 375 shooting ranges in the state. Hackbarth saidwith the increase in urban development intorural areas of the state that noise complaintsagainst the ranges have increased. The bill would require the commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources to de-velop voluntary guidelines for shooting ranges.It also stipulates that shooting ranges couldonly be closed or relocated because of a newdevelopment if the range becomes a \"clear, immediate, and proven safety hazard \" to the development. PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY TOM OLMSCHEID A bill to remove law enforcement discretion for granting permits to legally carry a concealed weaponin the state passed the House during the 2001 session but failed in the Senate. To demonstrate the change, imagine that a plaintiff is damaged by three different defen-dants. Imagine further that a jury finds thedefendants 55 percent, 35 percent and 10 per-cent at fault, respectively. Current law would allow the court to order the defendants 55 percent and 35 percent atfault to compensate the plaintiff for up to 100percent of their damages. Because the thirddefendant is less than 15 percent at fault, he orshe could be held accountable for up to fourtimes their actual liability, up to 40 percent ofthe plaintiff 's damage in this case. Courts would do this generally only if the first two defendants were unable to pay or hadinadequate insurance coverage. Courts order atotal of no more than 100 percent compensa-tion of a plaintiff 's damage. The bill would maintain existing law regard- ing environmental torts but eliminate a cur-rent provision preventing government entitiesfrom being ordered to pay more than $300,000per person or $1 million per incident. Joint andseveral liability is upheld for persons commit-ting intentional torts. Ideally, courts would order only compensa- tion proportional to the amount of eachdefendant 's fault. However, given that many defendants are simply unable to adequatelymeet the financial demands on their own, dueto inadequate insurance for example, courtssometimes order other defendants to compen-sate victims beyond their own proportionalfault. This is to prevent injured people fromhaving to pay expenses unfairly incurred tothem because of others ' negligence. Legislators have struggled to balance theneed to reasonably compensate victims with the desire to not unduly burden defendantswho may only be marginally at fault. In Bishop 's original version, defendants found less than 50 percent responsible couldbe held liable for no more than their propor-tion. If more than one-half at fault, a defendantcould be required to pay for all the damages.Rep. Joe Opatz (DFL-St. Cloud) proposedamending that figure to 40 percent duringfloor debate. He summarized the tension ex-pressed by many legislators. \"Do we err on the side of the victim and make a new victim, or dowe err on the side of the defendant and fail tomake the victim whole. \" Sen. John Hottinger (DFL-Mankato) spon- sored the bill in the Senate, where the JudiciaryCommittee took no action on the matter. HF369/SF629100NEW LAWS2001Bills in Limbo Stadium study stalled Action on a plan to assess proposals for a possible new stadium has been delayed until atleast 2002. A bill, sponsored by Rep. Doug Stang (R- Cold Spring) and Sen. Dave Johnson (DFL-Bloomington), would have accomplished thatby Oct. 31, 2001, but the plan was not ap-proved in either body. The bill would have created a privately funded, 17-member task force to study pro-posals to construct a new sports facility on theUniversity of Minnesota 's Minneapolis cam- pus or renovate the Metrodome to be used asa joint college and professional football facil-ity. If a new facility were approved, under theplan, the stadium would be home to the Go-pher football team and Minnesota Vikings. Stang said the appropriate role of the Legis- lature was to bring people together to find aworkable solution to the stadium issue. Members would have looked at program- matic, operational, and financial issues. A re-port was to be completed by Halloween 2001. The bill specifies that membership of the task force would include legislators, represen-tatives from business and labor, members ap-pointed by the governor, and members ap-pointed by the University of Minnesota Boardof Regents. It must also contain at least oneperson who opposes direct state appropria-tions or tax incentives. Under the bill, interested parties could have submitted proposals to the task force byAug. 1, 2001. At a minimum the proposalswere to include a credible estimate of totalcosts along with an analysis that a substantialmarket exists for the sport proposed for thestadium. The proposals would also contain a financ- ing plan that identified adequate funding, in-cluding at least a $150 million contributionfrom private sources, and must specify a pro-posed site for the stadium. The Vikings proposed site at the university for a retractable-roof stadium is east of MariucciIf a range were deemed a hazard but could be made safe, the DNR or the local unit of govern-ment would be required to pay for the im-provements, under the bill. Officials representing local government as- sociations spoke against the bill saying it wouldseverely limit local control and would giveshooting ranges unequaled preferentialtreatment. The measure was sponsored in the Senate by Sen. Steve Murphy (DFL-Red Wing). It awaitsaction in the Senate State and Local Govern-ment Operations Committee. HF209/SF434 RECREATION# No Twins stadium Proposals to help fund a $300 million open air, roof-ready ballpark for the MinnesotaTwins were stranded on base during the 2001session. Two separate proposals were approved by several legislative committees but neither madeit to a vote on the House or Senate floor. The first, sponsored by Rep. Harry Mares (R-White Bear Lake) and Sen. Dean Johnson(DFL-Willmar), would have provided a$100 million state loan guaranteed by the Twins,with a 3 percent interest rate, and $40 millionwould be provided by capturing the fundsfrom revenue bonds being repaid by the Min-nesota Wild hockey team as part of the XcelEnergy Center legislation. The final $10 mil-lion would be provided by a sales tax exemp-tion on the construction materials. That plan also would require Major League Baseball and its players ' association to reach agreement on a new financial structure thatensures the competitiveness of all major leagueteams. However, another House plan that had no sponsor in the Senate was pitched later in thesession. That bill (HF2513), also sponsored by Mares, would authorize the issuance of state revenuebonds up to $140 million to fund a loan to alocal unit of government for one-half of thecosts of the new stadium. The bill also would permit the local unit of government to impose a 10 percent admis-sions tax to help repay the loan and wouldprovide a sales tax exemption on constructionmaterials. The local unit of government wouldown the stadium. A property tax exemption for the ballpark,including parking facilities, would also be pro- vided under the measure. Furthermore, the bill would require the Twins to sign a 30-year lease with no escapeclauses. The issuance of the bonds would be contin- gent on reforms to the current financial struc-ture of the game by the owners and playersunion. HF2214/SF1857Arena, where parking lots now exist. University officials have emphasized the sta- dium is not a priority for them. \"We want to make sure our needs and de- sires are considered and we want to be part ofthe debate, not an afterthought, \" said Eric Kruse, vice president of University Services.\"We are here because others asked us to be here. Academics is our top priority. \" University representatives also showed a list of 10 principles given to the Vikings that wereconditions of its support. Among them are: the project cannot detract from current or future investment by the statein academic programs or capital projects, itcannot have a negative effect on the university 's balance sheet or debt capacity, the universitywill not be responsible for any capital projectcosts, and the university will participate in themanagement and oversight of dailyoperations. HF2241/SF2045 SAFETY# No primary seat belt offense A measure that would have designated driv- ing without a seat belt as a primary offense waschanged and nearly passed into law, but ulti-mately failed to gain the approval of both theHouse and Senate. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Tom Workman (R-Chanhassen) and Sen. John Hottinger(DFL-Mankato), initially would have allowedlaw enforcement to stop motorists if they werenot wearing their seat belts. The House versionwas changed to require all passengers to wearseat belts but it would be a primary offense foranyone under 18 in the car to not be wearing aseat belt. The measure was included in the Senate version of the omnibus transportation bill.However, it was removed during negotiationsover the bill before the end of the 2001 specialsession. Originally sponsored by Rep. Harry Mares (R-White Bear Lake), members of the HouseJudiciary Finance Committee amended an-other measure into the seat belt bill that wouldhave lowered the blood alcohol concentrationlimit from .10 percent to .08 percent. Thoughthat committee approved the bill with theamendment, Workman, who took over chiefsponsorship from Mares, said before the com-mittee that he would not request a furtherhearing on the bill.101Bills in Limbo NEW LAWS2001 Child restraint requirements A bill that would have changed seat belt and child restraint requirements for motorists didnot advance out of committee in either theHouse or Senate during the 2001 session. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley) and Sen. Leo Foley (DFL-Coon Rapids), would expand existing law thatrequires children under age 4 to be transportedin a child restraint system. That requirementwould be raised to children under age 9 whoweigh 80 pounds or less. In addition, the bill would require children under 12 months of age to be transported in arear-facing child passenger restraint system. The bill would increase the fine for a viola- tion of the law from $50 to $75. The penaltywould be waived if a parent demonstratedacquiring an adequate child-safety system. Testimony during committee hearings sug- gested that more children between the ages offour and eight die in automobile crashes thanSafer cigarettes not out yet Legislation for fire-retardant cigarettes burned out in a committee during the 2001session, but may be revived in 2002. The bill has already been pared down from its original plan. First introduced in the HouseCrime Prevention Committee, the bill wouldhave required cigarettes made or sold in Min-nesota to meet a fire-retardant standard estab-lished by the state fire marshal. The bill wassent to a second committee withoutrecommendation. The measure experienced its first big blow in the House Governmental Operations and Vet-erans Affairs Policy Committee when mem-bers killed it with a tie vote. The measure,however, would have required the Legislatureto give prior approval to state fire marshal rulesregarding fire-retardant standards for ciga-rettes, therefore not posing any immediatemandates for the cigarettes. Members expressed concern about the scope and costs of the rulemaking authority, whichare about $24,000. Two weeks later, the com-mittee reconsidered, then approved, themeasure. In the bill 's last stop in 2001, it was narrowly defeated by the House Commerce, Jobs andEconomic Development Policy Committee,with promises by members to keep an eye onother states ' action on the issue during the interim. The Senate companion, sponsored bySen. John Marty (DFL-Roseville), died in itsResolution for safer cigarettes The House approved a resolution urging Congress to pass legislation requiring only ciga-rettes that are less likely to start fires to be soldin the United States, but the Senate companionnever received a vote by the full body. The resolution was heard in a committee after members had voted down a measure thatwould have required the state fire marshal toadopt rules regarding fire-retardant standardsfor cigarettes (see related story, this page). Sponsored by Rep. Greg Davids (R-Preston), chair of the House Commerce, Jobs and Eco-nomic Development Policy Committee, theresolution addresses some concerns of mem-bers who voted down the bill for fire retardantcigarettes earlier in the 2001 session. It reads, in part: \"The Minnesota Legislature realizes that a state law may be rendered lesseffective by the availability of non-complyingcigarettes from other states. \"The development of appropriate regula- tions to reduce the risk of cigarette-related firesand the enforcement of such regulations canbe most efficiently and effectively accomplishedat the national level through federallegislation. \" Sen. Steve Murphy (DFL-Red Wing) spon- sored the resolution in the Senate. HF2362/SF2265Current law makes it illegal for a driver of a vehicle to not wear a seat belt. However, it isnot a primary offense, which means policecannot pull the driver over simply for thatviolation. The officer would have to have someother reason to stop the driver in order to issuea ticket for a seat belt violation. Other laws govern requirements that cer- tain children be buckled up. Children underage 4 must be restrained, and all children un-der 11 must be wearing a seat belt at all times ina car. HF1314/SF1178 A plan that would have made it a primary offense for anyone in a vehicle under age 18 not wearing aseatbelt was not included in the final omnibus transportation bill.PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID any other accidental injury. HF735/SF1267second committee hearing. Rep. Dennis Ozment (R-Rosemount), a re- tired firefighter, sponsored the bill in the House.The leading cause of fire deaths is carelesssmoking, he said. A cigarette manufacturer has developed a paper that resists burning unless the smoker isactually drawing oxygen through the cigarette.Small threadlike fire-retardant filaments arewound around the tobacco, surrounding thecigarette in a tight, cylindrical pattern. Rep. Bob Gunther (R-Fairmont), a com- merce committee member, said he supportsthe idea of the fire-safe cigarettes. However, hesaid 85 percent of the state 's population lives along state borders and he fears people will goto other states to purchase cigarettes, and pos-sibly gas and other commodities, which wouldresult in the state losing taxes and retail sales. Rep. Greg Davids (R-Preston), chair of the commerce committee, said he didn 't disagree with the measure, but would be more comfort-able with a federal mandate for the cigarettes. Something needs to be done nationwide to make a safer cigarette that reduces fires, \" he said.

A plan that would have allowed local governments to enforce existing traffic laws with photographic evidence failed to get appr oval from legislators in 2001. The bill would have allowed cities to erect \"photocop\" cameras that are activated when cars enter intersections after a stoplight t urns red. Police officers would then mail tickets to drivers who appear to be running a red light.PHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID TAXES# Tax-free troubles A proposal to create 10 tax-free zones in the state to stimulate economic development instruggling regions failed to pass either the fullHouse or the Senate. The bill, sponsored by House Majority Leader Tim Pawlenty (R-Eagan) and Sen. JimVickerman (DFL-Tracy), would authorize thecommissioner of the Department of Trade andEconomic Development to designate economi-cally distressed rural areas where qualifyingbusinesses would be exempt from income,sales, and property taxes. Residents also would be exempt from owing any individual income tax within the zones. Although the bill might seem like a radical idea, Pawlenty said it is already working in twoother states \u2014 Michigan and Pennsylvania. In fact, Pawlenty said, it has worked so well that both states are considering expanding theirlegislation. He cited a recent article that showedthe Pennsylvania initiative has led to 5,000 newjobs, giving it an award as the nation 's numberone economic development tool. The bill would require all local units of gov- ernment in the tax-free zone to give approvalbefore it could be established. It also includes arequirement that qualified businesses relocat-ing within the zone either increase employ-ment by 20 percent in the first full year ofoperations, or make a capital investment equalto 10 percent of gross revenues from the prioryear. There would be a 12-year duration limit on the zones and the maximum size of the zonewould be 5,000 acres. HF400/SF474Sponsored by Rep. Len Biernat (DFL-Mpls) and Sen. Roy Terwilliger (R-Edina), the mea-sure would have allowed cities to erect\"photocop \" cameras activated only when cars enter intersections after a stoplight has turnedred. A second photograph would be taken to determine the direction of the car and whetherit was stuck in traffic or if the driver was waitingfor other cars before turning left, according totestimony offered. The bill failed to advance out of the House Transportation Policy Committee, but themeasure was placed in the Senate 's omnibus transportation bill, which kept it alive throughthe special session. Negotiators ultimately removed the provi- sion from the bill. However, it could still bereconsidered by either body in the second yearof the biennium. Under the measure, police officers would review the photos taken and mail tickets onlyto those motorists who genuinely appear to berunning a red light. Ticketed drivers would stillhave the opportunity to contest the ticket incourt.103Bills in Limbo NEW LAWS2001 Bucks for bridges A bill intended to improve the bargaining positions of municipalities in negotiations withrailroads regarding rail bridges over publiclyowned roads stalled in a House committeeduring the 2001 session, although it passed theSenate. Rep. Alice Hausman (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen. Sandra Pappas (DFL-St. Paul) introducedthe measure to give local agencies the ability toenter into partnerships with railroads so pub-lic money could be used to help lengthenbridges, when local authorities decide aid wouldhelp meet current or future street and highwayneeds. The plan will prevent local taxpayersfrom having to purchase an entire bridge sim-ply to expand the roadways that go belowthem. Railroads routinely refuse to lengthen bridges for the benefit of localities. Since state law nowprohibits local agencies from spending moneyto extend bridges owned by railroadPHOTO BY TOM OLMSCHEID A plan was tabled in 2001 that would have allowed a local authority to enter into a partnership with a railroad so public money could be used to lengthen a bridge over a street or highway when the local road authority deems assistance would be advantageous to meet street or highway needs. No room for 'Choose Life' plates A bill that would have allowed drivers the option to purchase \"Choose Life \" license plates was originally included in the House 's omni- bus transportation funding bill but did notmake the final cut in 2001. Rep. Ray Vandeveer (R-Forest Lake) sponsored the plan that was amended out ofthe House bill before it went to the floor. ItsSenate companion, sponsored by Sen. DonSamuelson (DFL-Brainerd), failed in commit-tee. Under the plan, residents could have paid an extra $25 to receive special plates with the\"Choose Life \" saying. That money would have gone into an \"adoption support account \" in the general fund. The money would then begiven to counties. It specified that \"each county receiving funds shall distribute the funds to nongovernmental,nonprofit agencies whose services are limitedIn addition, the cameras could only photo- graph the rear of the cars, not the drivers. Stolen vehicles and rented cars would have been exempt. In addition, tickets issued throughthe photocop method would not have ap-peared on a driver 's record. HF663/SF1017to counseling and meeting the physical needs of pregnant women who are committed to placing their children for adoption. The origi-nal bill specified that \"funds could not be distributed to any agency that is directly orindirectly involved in or associated with abor-tion activities. \" Vandeveer testified in the House Transpor- tation Policy meeting that \"at least 70 percent (of a $25 fee) would provide for the materialneeds of pregnant women who have made thechoice to put their child up for adoption. \" Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester) made the motion to remove the provision from theHouse 's omnibus bill during a meeting of the Ways and Means Committee. Jackie Schwietz, former executive director of Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, saidthe bill is modeled after a Florida license platefirst made in 1999. On the other hand, Connie Perpich, direc- tor of public affairs for Planned Parenthood ofMinnesota described the bill 's provisions as establishing an \"extremely odious gag rule, \" which would prevent any receiving agency fromoffering, in the bill 's language, \"counseling for or referrals to abortion clinics \" or \"pro- abortion advertising. \" She went on to suggest that the state could better promote the bill 's intent by \"increasing tax deduction for adop- tion. \"Some members objected to provisions of the proposal, saying it sets the state up as a collec- tion agency for private organizations. Otherssaid it would merely create another of manylicense plates allowed for private groups. HF2193/SF2039104NEW LAWS2001Bills in Limbo No constitutional amendments last Several proposals that would have created a constitutional amendment dedicating moneyfor transportation purposes were pitched dur-ing the 2001 session, but none was successful. However, two proposals were included in the House version of the omnibus transporta-tion bill, but not in the Senate 's. One proposal would have placed a constitu- tional amendment on the ballot dedicating60 percent of the sales tax receipts on motorvehicles to the highway user tax distributionfund. It was sponsored by Rep. Connie Ruth(R-Owatonna) and Senate Minority LeaderDick Day (R-Owatonna). The highway fund distributes the revenuescompanies, municipalities must purchase bridges in order to lengthen them. The result-ing maintenance costs bear heavily on citiesand counties. Hausman said the state Department of Transportation currently has the ability tospend some money to extend railroad bridges. Ken Haider, Ramsey County Department of Public Works director and engineer, said thatallowing local officials this discretion coulddecrease the cost to local taxpayers while stillallowing for road improvements and not harm-ing railroads. Under the plan, a local road authority may not provide any financial assistance for eithercommuter rail or light-rail transit projects. During a meeting of the House Transporta- tion Policy Committee, Rep. Tom Workman(R-Chanhassen) expressed concern aboutspending money for corporate-held property.Haider said public funds would still beappropriated by the state and authorized bycounty regulators. \"This is not free reign tofrom motor fuels and vehicle registration taxes primarily to the state trunk highway fund (forroad improvements) as well as the county andmunicipal state aid funds. The Senate took no action on the measure and would not agree to the proposal in theworking group negotiating the final bill. Several other members from both the Re- publican and DFL parties proposed dedicatingmotor vehicle sales tax revenue for highwaypurposes, but the 60 percent figure was the oneultimately chosen by the House Transporta-tion Finance Committee for the omnibus fund-ing bill. Another constitutional amendment bill (HF1861/SF1686) that would have changedthe requirement that trunk highway improve-ment bonds could only be repaid into thetrunk highway fund was removed from thefinal transportation funding law.
