The same mechanisms cause inflammation and can give rise to disease. Peter was an expert on complement, a system that contributes largely to these mechanisms. His research interests included the immunochemistry, biology and genetics of complement. His work in downregulating its central pathway promised to produce a treatment for the eye condition, age-related macular degeneration. He also studied immunopathology \u2014 the ways in which the immune system causes disease, with a special interest in systemic lupus erythematosus and allergy to insect stings. Peter was founding President of the Academy of Medical Sciences and was active in policy and ethical aspects of medical science in a number of key areas such as vaccination policy, stem cell research and genetically modified crops. Peter received several international awards and was knighted in 2002. Sir Peter Lachmann FMedSci FRS died on 26 December 2020. |Source||Sources:| Royal Society profile page https://royalsociety.obeebeerg/people/peter-lachmann-11777/ (accessed 15 January 2021) Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lachmann (accessed 15 January 2021) References: Obituary, Trinity College Cambridge, 27 Dec: 2020 https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/news/professor-sir-peter-julius-lachmann-frcp-frcpath-frs-fmedsci-1931-2020/ (accessed 20 January 2021) Obituary - Professor Sir Peter Lachmann FRS FMedSci, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Cambridge, 6 Jan 2021 https://www.vet.cam.ac.uk/news/obituary (accesses 20 January 2021) Very Sad News - Professor SiR Peter Lachmann FRS FMedSci, Christ's College, University of Cambridge, 27 Dec 2020 https://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/news/very-sad-news-professor-sir-peter-lachmann-frs-fmedsci (accessed 20 January "}
