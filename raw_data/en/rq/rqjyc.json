Initially, it's a very good thing. However, extended periods of inflammation within the body can create significant issues. Let's find out more about the Defense system of the body. Defense - a complex system Our bodies are incredibly smart and powerful machines that work to send healing to the distressed area - without us even thinking about it. Inflammation can exist in various places in the body. Unfortunately, we brush up against multiple inflammation-causing sources in our day-to-day lives, like processed foods, air pollution, overexertion, and stress. When inflammation is up, immunity often gets run down - and vice versa. Inflammation can look like puffiness, joint pain, or even trouble digesting certain foods in our bodies. Defensive digestion The digestive process is among the most energy-intensive in the human body. When the body is busy sending healing to a damaged area, the capacity to digest food fully decreases - it's simply too overwhelmed. Take the nervous system, for example; when we are in \"fight-or-flight\" mode, the digestive process slows because the body goes to save energy to flee from danger. Sixty to eighty percent of our immune system is located in our gut. Our gut health is directly linked to our overall health - our ability to fight disease, inflammation, and possible invaders. One of the most common gut imbalances people are suffering from today is leaky gut syndrome, also known as increased intestinal permeability. What is leaky gut? The lining of our digestive tract is one single cell layer thick. These cells form a barrier between our bloodstream, immune system (which governs inflammation), and the outside world. In a healthy body, these cells are closely locked together, forming \"tight junctions.\" These tight junctions form a protective barrier in the gut, ensuring that everything we eat is adequately processed and well-assimilated nutrients. When they break down, we develop what is called leaky gut syndrome. With space between these tight junctions, bacteria and toxins, undigested proteins and fats, and waste leak out of the intestines into the bloodstream. This can trigger inflammation in the body. The connection between inflammation and digestion goes both ways. Poor digestion can cause inflammation, and inflammation can cause poor digestion. Fortunately, the 21-Day Clean Program is created to dampen inflammation, ease digestion, support immune function, and help the body back to a balanced state. By dampening inflammation in the body with the 21-Day Cleanse, we allow our body to better fight off pathogens and increase our immune function. In addition to our signature 21-Day Clean Program, here are some of our favorite products for strengthening the Defense system by building immune capabilities and fighting inflammation: Ancient medicinals Fortify is an herbal immune support blend, delivering a proprietary blend of Ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese Medicine herbs, including concentrated andrographis and amla for supporting the immune system. Andrographis is an herb native to South Asian countries that has long been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurvedic Medicine. Andrographis is rich in compounds known as andrographolides. These compounds have anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antioxidant properties. Andrographis supports immune system health at the onset by supporting healthy levels of immune cells in the blood. Amla is one of the most important medicinal plants used in Ayurvedic Medicine. One amla fruit contains as much vitamin C as 20 oranges. It also provides antioxidant support, which allows for it to support a healthy inflammatory response. Its high vitamin C content and polyphenols support healthy tissue integrity, average cellular growth, and healthy immune response. Essential C Our bodies don't make vitamin C, but we need it for immune function, bone structure, iron absorption, and healthy skin. Vitamin C is an essential micronutrient and a potent antioxidant. Antioxidants are molecules that boost the immune system. Vitamin C contributes to immune defense by supporting various cellular functions of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. It supports epithelial barrier function against pathogens and promotes the oxidant scavenging activity of the skin, thereby potentially protecting against environmental oxidative stress\u2014vitamin C deficiency results in impaired immunity and higher susceptibility to infections. Guard is our scientifically developed vitamin C to help increase your resilience. This ultra-potent vitamin C features a unique blend of metabolites designed to enhance absorption and utilization. Vitamin C both supports immune health and acts as an antioxidant to protect cells from free radical damage. Guard's ultra-potent formula promotes natural killer cell and white blood cell activity. Guard also contains buffering agents that help prevent potential stomach upset associated with vitamin C. Immune system gatekeeper Zinc is a \"gatekeeper\" of your immune function. It's a key player in the signaling between your body's immune tolerance and defense systems, aka when it should signal for help or can handle the load. Zinc also has antioxidant properties, and it's essential in developing T-cells, your body's guards against antigens. It's involved in every step in wound healing, from repairing cell membranes to managing oxidative stress, tissue generation and scar formation. Our zinc formula, Shield, is a highly absorbable, Gi-friendly zinc. It features zinc as an amino acid chelate with arginine and glycine designed to be easily absorbed and well-tolerated, so it won't upset your stomach. Antioxidants for a boost Revive is a vegan superfood greens powder that supports cleansing, energy, and rejuvenation. This greens powder boasts a delicious flavor that acts as the perfect added ingredient for smoothies or in a glass of water. With Revive, you'll get various antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals added to your diet with every serving to support immune defense and decrease inflammation. This is also incredibly helpful in a world with depleted soil and shelves stacked with nutrient-poor, processed foods. The sunshine hormone Vitamin D deficiency is estimated to affect almost 50% of the population worldwide. An estimated 1 billion people worldwide have a vitamin D deficiency across all ethnicities and age groups. Vitamin D helps us maintain healthy teeth, a healthy brain, a healthy nervous system, and strengthen immune defenses. Optimized vitamin D levels have been linked to increased immune function and a reduction of inflammatory responses. Shine, is a dose of 2500 IU of D3 and K2 in a single serving. We designed it to replenish and maintain vitamin D status in a complete way for most people, coupled with vitamin K2 for maximum efficacy.
