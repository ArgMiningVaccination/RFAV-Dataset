As an accredited institution, ACHS offers many funding options, including federal financial aid to those who qualify; direct payment options, such as semester payments and monthly payment installment p lans; military and employer tuition assistance benefits; and a wide range of other alternative funding options discussed below. ACHS is approved for qualifying students to receive funding from: In-house Semester and Monthly Payment Installment Plans (PIPs) Federal student aid programs (Federal School Code 04194400) Veteran's benefits Military tuition assistance Employer tuition assistance Workforce Investment Act (WIA) funds (ACHS is on the Eligible Training Provider List (ETPL) for Oregon) Vocational Rehabilitation funding ACHS Military Award Program Scholarship ACHS Adult Scholarship AmeriCorps Education Award Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) Program Private student loans More information about ACHS's tuition options is available at achs.edu/admissions/financial -aid-achs/ .

American College of Healthcare Sciences \u00a9 2023 -2024 Program Catalog. | achs.edu In effect 7/1/23 until superseded by a newer version. 45 Payment Installment Plans at ACHS ACHS students can pay for each semester's courses at the time of registration or pay in convenient automatic monthly payments. Monthly Payment Installment Plans (\"PIPs\") are a courtesy extended to help students budget for college without taking on student loan debt. PIPs are simply the semester balance divided by the installment plan . There are no fees to participate in a PIP. Failing to Make Payments on Time A late fee (currently $20) is applied to any payment that is received after the due date. In fair ness to all students, payments that are more than seven days late will result in further collection actions and restricted access to current course(s). Students should contact the Business Office immediately if they anticipate having a payment issue. Pleas e note: The continued convenience of a payment installment plan is only available to students who incur no more than two late fees. Using a Debit Card for Course Payments When using a debit card for a monthly payment plan, students assume all liability f or overdraft fees. ACHS recommends that students only use a debit card if overdraft protection is available on the account. ACHS's billing system will charges the credit card on file automatically each month. ACHS can only make changes to a payment if a written request is received at least seven (7) days prior to the charge. For students without a credit card for automatic monthly payments, they may elect to make a payment in full for the semester tuition, materials, and fees. ACHS requires all students tha t do not pay in full for the semester to arrange an automatic monthly payment. Rising Costs ACHS works with publishers and vendors to keep the cost of texts and course packs affordable, but is not able to predict future costs. ACHS's Board of Directors c arefully reviews cost -savings initiatives and opportunities to maximize each student's investment before considering a tuition increase. In addition, ACHS continually works with vendors to negotiate the best pricing on course materials to provide the highe st quality and most affordable course packs to students.

Unless relieved of the obligation to do so, you must pay the state -imposed assessment for the STRF, or it must be paid on your behalf, if you are a student in an educational program, who is a C alifornia resident, or are enrolled in a residency program, and prepay all or part of your tuition. You are not eligible for protection from the STRF and you are not required to pay the STRF assessment, if you are not a California resident, or are not enrolled in a residency program. It is important that you keep copies of your enrollment agreement, financial aid documents, receipts, or any other information that documents the amount paid to the school. Questions regarding the STRF may be directed to t he Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education, 2535 Capitol Oaks Drive, Suite 400, Sacramento, CA 95833, (916) 431 -6959 or (888) 370 -7589. To be eligible for STRF, you must be a California resident or enrolled in a residency program, prepaid tuition, paid or deemed to have paid the STRF assessment, and suffered an economic loss as a result of any of the following: 1. The institution, a location of the institution, or an educational program offered by the institution was closed or discontinued, and you did not choose to participate in a teach - out plan approved by the Bureau or did not complete a chosen teach -out plan approved by the Bureau. 2. You were enrolled at an institution or a location of the institution within the 120 day period before the closure of the institution or location of the institution, or were enrolled in an educational program within the 120 day period before the program was discontinued. 3. You were enrolled at an institution or a location of the institution more than 120 days before the closure of the institution or location of the institution, in an educational program offered by the institution as to which the Bureau determined there was a American College of Healthcare Sciences \u00a9 2023 -2024 Program Catalog. | achs.edu In effect 7/1/23 until superseded by a newer version. 57 significant decline in the quality or value of the program more than 120 days before closure. 4. The institution has been ordered to pay a refund by the Bureau but has failed to do so. 5. The institution has failed to pay or reimburse loan proceeds under a federal student loan program as required by law, or has failed to pay or reimburse proceeds received by the institution in excess of tuition and other costs. 6. You have been awarded restitution, a refund, or other monetary award by an arbitrator or court, based on a violation of this chapter by an institution or representative of an institutio n, but have been unable to collect the award from the institution. 7. You sought legal counsel that resulted in the cancellation of one or more of your student loans and have an invoice for services rendered and evidence of the cancellation of the student loan or loans. To qualify for STRF reimbursement, the application must be received within four (4) years from the date of the action or event that made the student eligible for recovery from STRF. A student whose loan is revived by a loan holder or debt collector after a period of non-collection may, at any time, file a written application for recovery from STRF for the debt that would have otherwise been eligible for recovery. If it has been more than four (4) years since the action or event that made t he student eligible, the student must have filed a written application for recovery within the original four (4) year period, unless the period has been extended by another act of law. However, no claim can be paid to any student without a social security number or a taxpayer identification number.

The balance of the travel program fee is due eight weeks before the first day of class. A 100% refund is offered if students withdraw in writing within five days of enrollment.

If withdrawal is received within eight weeks of the first day of class, no refund is available. All students are required to obtain travel insurance prior to departure to cover travel expenses as well as medical expenses while on the study tour. Note: Cooling off period of seven days applies for California residents. For these residents, there is no charge until after the cooling off period. Return to Title IV Policy A student receiving federal (Title IV) financial aid who withdraws is subject to \"Return to Title IV\" provisions. Federal statutes require ACHS to recalculate eligibility for any student who completely withdraws during any term or payment period if the student received or was eligible to receive Title IV funds in that period. ACHS uses a prorated calculation provided by the Department of Education, referred to as an R2T4, to determine the percentage of aid earned and recalculate eligibility for Title IV funds. This is based on the number of days elapsed when the student withdraws or is withdrawn by the institution divided by the number of days in the semester. If a student earned less aid than was disbursed, ACHS will return a portion of the funds and the stud ent is required to return a portion of the funds. When Title IV funds are returned, the student may owe a balance to ACHS. Students are responsible for payment of any remaining balance whether or not they are readmitted to the school. The percentage of fed eral financial aid determined to be unearned for the payment period must be returned to the appropriate federal financial aid program(s). If a student earns more aid than was disbursed to them, ACHS will reimburse the student a post -withdrawal disbursemen t that will be paid within 120 days of the date that ACHS determined that the student withdrew. American College of Healthcare Sciences \u00a9 2023 -2024 Program Catalog. | achs.edu In effect 7/1/23 until superseded by a newer version. 59 Refunds are allocated in the following order: Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan Subsidized Federal Direct Loan Federal Parent (PLUS) Loan Federal Pell Grant Federal Supplemental Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) Other Title IV Assistance Other State, Private, and Institutional aid Withdrawals Federal student aid is disbursed to students 30 days after the start date of a semester following verification of participation at the end of the census period (the first 14 days of class). The assumption is that students will complete all courses for wh ich the aid was disbursed. If a student withdraws before the end of the period, ACHS must determine the portion of aid the student earned and calculate any Title IV funds that should be returned to the U.S. Department of Education or disbursed to the stu dent as a post -withdrawal disbursement. If a student provides official notification to the school of their intent to withdraw, the withdrawal date is the date of the student's notification. If a student did not provide notification of their intent to wit hdraw, the withdrawal date is the midpoint of the semester or the last date of an academically related activity in which the student participated (if that information is available). If a withdrawing student received (or ACHS or a parent received on the st udent's behalf) less aid than the student earned (based on the federal formula), the student may be eligible to receive additional funds. If the student received more aid than the student earned, the excess must be returned to the Title IV aid program (by ACHS and/or by the student). American College of Healthcare Sciences \u00a9 2023 -2024 Program Catalog. | achs.edu In effect 7/1/23 until superseded by a newer version. 60 Date of Determination For a student who withdraws without providing notification to the school, ACHS will determine the withdrawal date no later than 30 days after the end of the semester. The College will return the amount of federal financial aid funds for which it is responsible no later than 45 days after the date the College determines the student has withdrawn. Calculating Aid Earned The amount of aid earned is determined on a pro rata basis. For example, if a student completed 30% of the period of enrollment, then the student earned 30% of the aid they were awarded. However, once the student has completed more than 60% of the period of enrollment, they are considered to have earned 100% of the aid scheduled for that period. There may also be some Title IV funds the student was scheduled to receive but not yet disbursed because of a failure to meet other Title IV eligibility requirements. For example, if a student is a first -time, first -year underg raduate student and does not complete the first 30 days of their program before withdrawing, the student will not be eligible to receive any federal Direct Loan funds. Verification and the Return Calculation If a student provides required verification do cuments after withdrawing from ACHS, but within 30 days of the date of the notification informing the student of the requirements, and in time for the College to meet the 30 -day return deadline, the R2T4 calculation will be calculated based on all federal financial aid the student had established eligibility for prior to the withdrawal. For the Federal Pell Grant Program, if the student provides the verification documents after the 30 -day deadline but before the earlier of 120 days after the student's last date of attendance or the deadline established by the Department of Education (ED) each award year, ACHS will review and address eligibility as required. If a student does not provide all verification documents in time for ACHS to complete verification a nd meet the R2T4 deadlines, the College will include in the R2T4 calculation only the federal financial aid that was not subject to verification American College of Healthcare Sciences \u00a9 2023 -2024 Program Catalog. | achs.edu In effect 7/1/23 until superseded by a newer version. 61 (unsubsidized and PLUS loan funds) and for which the conditions of a late disbursement were met prior to the wi thdrawal. Funds Owed to ACHS The requirements for Title IV program funds when students withdraw are separate from the ACHS Refund Policy. Therefore, even if a student has earned all of the federal aid disbursed to them according to the Department's form ula, they may still owe funds to ACHS to cover unpaid institutional charges. Late Disbursements & Overpayments Conditions for a Late Disbursement Following are the conditions under which a late disbursement may occur: The Department of Education (ED) processed a Student Aid Report (SAR) or Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) with an official Expected Family Contribution (EFC) for the student (except in the case of a parent PLUS loan) The College originated a Direct Loan (DL) The College awarded the student the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) Inadvertent Overpayments An inadvertent overpayment occurs when ACHS disburses funds to a student no longer in attendance but prior to the date ACHS determines the student withdrew from the program. This would include any federal financial aid fund disbursements made after the student's last date of attendance, but prior to ACHS's determination that the student has been withdrawn. These inadvertent overpayments are included in the R2T4 calculation as aid that could have been disbursed. Only students who meet late disbursement criteria are entitled to keep federal financial aid funds disbursed as an inadvertent overpayment. If an inadvertent overpayment could not have been made as a late disbursement, ACHS will return the entire amount of the federal financial aid funds disbursed. If the inadvertent overpayment could have been made as a late disbursement, ACHS will return only the unearned portion of the inadverte nt overpayment within 45 days of the College's date American College of Healthcare Sciences \u00a9 2023 -2024 Program Catalog. | achs.edu In effect 7/1/23 until superseded by a newer version. 62 of determination that the student withdrew. Unearned inadvertent overpayments will be returned according to the requirements for the return of unearned funds. Grant Overpayments Any unearned grant aid t hat students must return is considered an overpayment.

Therefore, all students and faculty of ACHS must abide by the ACHS Academi c Honesty Policy. Failure to do so is grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from the College. ACHS expects all ACHS students to be completely honest. Each student must complete their own assignments and examinations. Evaluation i s based on the merit of original coursework. To uphold Academic Honesty, students will: Complete their own work, including all writing submissions, discussions, tests, and exams. Honor all closed -book exams and not refer to outside materials. Never share assessment questions before or after taking a test or exam, copy the test/exam questions, or store test/exam questions on their computer. Not submit the same assessment (e.g., research paper, literature review, case study, practical, discussion, etc.) for two or more courses without prior approval from their current professor(s). If approved, there must not be more than a 30% similarity betw een the new and original assessment. What is Plagiarism? Plagiarism may be intentional (deliberately representing words, ideas, or data of another person as one's own without properly attributing through quotation, reference, or footnote) or inadvertent (inappropriate, but non -deliberate use of another's words, ideas, or data without proper attribution). Examples include: Verbatim copying of an original source without acknowledgment of that source (for example, copying and pasting an online course lecture into a blog or personal website \u2014a small amount can be quoted for educational purpose s, but the general rule is not more than 10%) Paraphrasing ideas from another without acknowledgment Borrowing words, ideas, or data from an original source and blending this original material without acknowledging the source, which gives the false impress ion that this is original research and ideas Partial or incomplete attribution of words, ideas, or data from an original source Copying and pasting AI generated content without including appropriate citation American College of Healthcare Sciences \u00a9 2023 -2024 Program Catalog. | achs.edu In effect 7/1/23 until superseded by a newer version. 164 Using paper -generating websites to generate or a lter unoriginal content to avoid plagiarism detection Students must author any work submitted at ACHS. Submitting AI -generated content as original work is prohibited and will be regarded as a breach in the academic honesty policy. Students are still held responsible if plagiarism is inadvertent. Whether they choose to summarize, paraphrase, or quote an author, ACHS requires students to form their own ideas and use their own words. If they are unsure whether or not they are properly attributing, students should consult with their professor(s) and refer to the resources in the online classroom and/or in the ACHS Student Center for guidance.

Cheating includes, but is not limited to: Using prohibited materials during a closed -book exam Collaborating on an examination or assignment without auth orization Taking an examination or completing an assignment for another student, or permitting someone else to take an examination or to complete an assignment on behalf of another student Inappropriately providing or receiving information or academic work so as to gain unfair advantage over others (such as selling or buying a copy of exam questions before an exam) Conspiring to commit any act of academic dishonesty Attempting to gain an unfair academic advantage by bribery Changing or altering grades or ot her official educational records Continuing work on an examination after the allocated time has ended Procedures for Handling Incidents of Academic Dishonesty: Consequences If a professor at ACHS suspects that students have breached the Academic Honesty Policy, they are responsible for investigating the situation and taking appropriate action. If academic dishonesty is suspected, the professor will first discuss the incident directly with the student to determine if the act was intentional. If the professor believes the breach was unintentional , the first step is for the student to resubmit their work by an agreed upon deadline. Note that late assignment penalties may apply if the plagiarism or dishonesty is found after the assessment due date. American College of Healthcare Sciences \u00a9 2023 -2024 Program Catalog. | achs.edu In effect 7/1/23 until superseded by a newer version. 165 If the professor believes that the breach was intentional , they may give a failing grade for that assessment. Depending on the gravity of the plagiarism or cheating, or the assessment in question (e.g., a final exam), this may result in failing the course. Generally, students who have cheated on a final exam will not be permitted to retake the exam and will instead be required to retake the course in its entirety if they are permitted to continue with the institution.

Dual Capstone Policy The ACHS capstone project represents a culmination of a student's academic work and experience with ACHS. The purpose of a capstone project is multi -faceted: to demons trate mastery of a particular subject, to demonstrate achievement of program learning outcomes, and to enhance a student's professional portfolio. During the capstone course, students design their own capstone projects and draw from all facets of their edu cation. Due to the highly specialized nature of a capstone project, students pursuing two master's degrees with ACHS will typically be required to complete two distinct capstone projects. In some cases, a student may petition the Academic Standards Committ ee to complete one capstone project that meets the requirements for two master's degrees. The following parameters must be met in order to qualify for review by the Committee: The student must be enrolled in two master's degrees concurrently The capstone project must align with the learning outcomes of both programs View the procedure for applying for a dual capstone online at achs.edu/capstone -dual - majors .

Generally, students will be required to complete a program pr ior to enrolling in a secondary program. In special circumstances, dual program enrollment may be approved by the Academic Standards Committee in accordance with the following guidelines. General Guidelines for Dual Program Enrollment 1. Dual programs must b e in complementary disciplines. 2. The student must meet all admissions requirements for both programs. Students applying for dual program enrollment must have a minimum incoming GPA of 3.0 for new students. Current students must hold a 3.0 cumulative GPA at ACHS, have completed at least 12 semester credits, and be in good academic standing. 3. Dual program enrollment must be approved by the appropriate Program Dean (s). Students applying for Dual Enrollment in a Master degree program may also petition to complete a single Capstone project, subject to advance approval by the applicable Program Dean (s). See the Dual Capstone policy. Please note : If already a graduate of an ACHS Master Degree program and returning to complete a second degree, the student is not eligible to petition for a dual Capstone.

We also ask students to abide by an honor code. Key points for exams: Final exams are closed book : They must be completed without reference to other materials including online search to ols. Exams are designed to be challenging to complete in the given time to ensure that the student does not have time to refer to outside materials. All final exams are closed -book and must be taken without the use of notes or other reference materials; s tudents are expected to honor this requirement. Each section of each online examination pulls questions randomly from a larger \"pool\" of questions, so that each student sees a different examination. No student may share quiz or exam questions with any ot her student, before or after taking a quiz, module exam, or final exam. Online exams also utilize other methods to ensure academic honesty, for example tracking students' IP addresses and the times students are logged on. We expect each student to uphold the standards of academic honesty laid out in this Catalog. Proctored Examinations To ensure academic integrity, ACHS requires students to take proctored assessments at appropriate intervals throughout their program. This verifies that the student who takes the exam is the same person who enrolled in the program and that the examination results will reflect the student's own knowledge and competence in accordance with stated learning outcomes. Students complete proctored exams through the online classroom in Canvas; proctored exams require a web camera.

Faculty may evaluate student performance through quizzes, exams, discussion posts, class participation, research work, e ssays, group projects, and other appropriate assessments. Grading Scale ACHS uses a letter grading system. All courses and course grades, except those courses dropped during the drop period, are recorded on a student's permanent academic transcript. Only grades earned at ACHS are computed in the Grade Point Average (GPA).

American College of Healthcare Sciences \u00a9 2023 -2024 Program Catalog. | achs.edu In effect 7/1/23 until superseded by a newer version. 178 If a student changes majors, ACHS credits that have been applied to the new major will count as Total Semester Credits Attempted and towards the student's Total Semester Credits Completed at ACHS. The grades from such credits will be calculated into the Minimum CGPA. GPA & Pace of Completion Calculations Add/Drop Policy Students may add courses within the first 14 days of each semester. Students who add courses after the start of the semester are responsible for fulfilling all course requirem ents. Students may drop courses through the last date to drop with refund, as outlined on the ACHS Academic Calendar. A pro -rata refund will be applied in accordance with the institution's refund policy. Courses dropped before the last day to drop will re ceive a \"W\" grade; courses dropped after the last day to drop will receive an \"F\" grade. Requests to drop should be submitted via email to Student Services at stuserv@achs.edu ; phone or fax to 800.487.8839; or mail to ACHS, 5005 S. Macadam Ave, Portland, OR 97239. When dropping a course, the refund policy is applied based on the date the request is received at ACHS or the postmarked date if mailed, not the last date of attendan ce. Course Incompletes - \"I\" Grade Students who are unable to complete a course due to circumstances beyond the student's control may be eligible to apply for an Incomplete \"I\" grade. Student has completed at least 50% of all coursework two weeks prior to the end of a semester (or one week prior to the end of an accelerated term). For courses with a major project such as a research paper, or case study portfolio, the student must have submitted a first draft as part of their completed coursework to qualify for an incomplete. For capstone courses, students must have submitted at least one draft of all sections of their paper. Student requests an Incomplete by submitting an Incomplete Grade Request form contact.achs.edu/incomplete -grade -request -form by two weeks prior to the end of a semester or one week prior to the end of an accelerated term (fees apply \u2014view fee information at achs.edu/other -fees). The Incomplete Grade Request form requires students to provide a specific plan for completing all outstanding coursework within 30 days. American College of Healthcare Sciences \u00a9 2023 -2024 Program Catalog. | achs.edu In effect 7/1/23 until superseded by a newer version. 179 Incomplete grade requests are r eviewed and decided by the student's advisor in collaboration with faculty teaching the incomplete course(s). Students will receive notification of the decision on their request via email and/or phone. During the 30 days provided for completion, students are required to meet with their assigned Student Success Advisor by phone or virtual conference or provide a written update to demonstrate progress and receive support and coaching as needed to complete outstanding coursework. Students will regularly com municate with their course Faculty regarding any questions or concerns and notify the instructor when work is submitted. Students will be given up to 30 days to complete outstanding coursework; additional time may be granted in special circumstances. If a student requires more than 30 days and has not submitted a satisfactory amount of work (at least 50% of all outstanding coursework needed for course completion) then the student must retake the course. Incomplete grades not converted to a passing grade w ithin one year will be assigned a failing or \"F\" grade, and the student will be required to retake the course. Students who have completed at least 50% of the course and have not applied for an Incomplete grade will receive an \"F\" grade, also called an \"Ea rned F\", and the student will be required to retake the course. An \"I\" grade does not impact the calculation of CGPA. Credits associated with courses in which an Incomplete grade is received are included in Total Semester Credits Attempted, and they count toward the maximum timeframe for completion. Please see Grading Scale for more information. Course Withdrawals \u2014 \"W\" Grade A \"W\" grade is not included in the calculation of CGPA. Credits associated with courses with a \"W\" grade count toward the Total Se mester Credits Attempted and Maximum Time Frame for Completion. Course Repeats Credits from all course attempts will be counted in Total Semester Credits Attempted and count towards the Maximum Time Frame for Completion. Only the highest grade received w ill be included in the calculation of CGPA. Upon completion of the repeated course, the grade earned will be included in the GPA. The grade in the original course will be changed to R to indicate it was repeated. American College of Healthcare Sciences \u00a9 2023 -2024 Program Catalog. | achs.edu In effect 7/1/23 until superseded by a newer version. 180 Generally, a course may be repeated one ti me. In exceptional circumstances, the Academic Standards Committee may approve additional repeat attempt(s). Students receiving Title IV Federal Financial Aid may repeat a course in accordance with ACHS's academic policy and Department of Education guideli nes. Transfer Credits from Other Institutions, Readmitted Students, and Students Changing Majors If a student transfers to ACHS from another institution, the transfer credits that have been accepted by ACHS will count as Total Semester Credits Attempted and Total Semester Credits Completed. The grades from such credits will not be included in the calculation of CGPA. If a student changes majors, ACHS credits that have been applied to the new major will count as Total Semester Credits Attempted and towards the student's Total Semester Credits Completed at ACHS. The grades from such credits will also be calculated into the CGPA. Grade Appeals Students may dispute a grade if they disagree with a professor's assessment of their performance. To dispute a final grade received in a course, students should contact their professor with the basis of their dispute. A grade dispute will be considered onl y if there is evidence of any of the following: The grade was incorrectly calculated Unaccountable conduct on the part of the professor Clerical error in recording the grade (i.e., the professor communicated a grade different than the one received) If a student is unable to resolve a disputed grade with their professor, the student may petition the Academic Standards Committee (ASC). The student must submit the Academic Standards Committee Petition Form within two weeks of the end of the course to be c onsidered. The ASC may conduct an independent review of student work contributing to the disputed grade in coordination with the Program Dean and make a final determination. The Program Dean or ASC designee will advise the student of the Committee's decisi on by email or in writing and will update the student's academic record with the appeal decision. American College of Healthcare Sciences \u00a9 2023 -2024 Program Catalog. | achs.edu In effect 7/1/23 until superseded by a newer version. 181 Please be aware that a grade appeal does not guarantee a higher grade. The disputed grade may be maintained, raised, or lowered as a result of a review. Assessment Re -submissions Students should contact their professor directly if they need to retake a module exam or resubmit an assignment. We encourage students to carefully review their graded assessment and discuss any difficulties they had with the mate rial with their professor before retaking the assessment. Resubmissions are at the discretion of the professor. Remember that assessments are designed to be learning tools and they enable the professor to evaluate whether or not students have achieved the learning outcomes for the module or course. The grade for the resubmitted assessment will replace the initial grade. Continued failure to earn a passing grade may necessitate a student's dismissal from the course. Retaking the Final Exam The grade for the resubmitted final examination will replace the initial grade.

Leave of Absence Policy Course If a student needs a temporary leave of absence from a course, the student should reach out to their student services advisor and instructor. In some cases, the student may be able to make arrangements to submit coursework ahead of schedule or receive modi fied due dates to cover the leave period. Students are required to participate in substantive interaction in class each week, so approved leave options during a course may be limited. Students should refer to the section in this catalog and in their course syllabus titled, Required Assessments, for more information about managing course assignments. If a student is not able to continue in a course in the current semester, the student will be directed to drop the course and register for the course in the n ext semester. The ACHS Refund Policy applies to the course drop and tuition is prorated accordingly. American College of Healthcare Sciences \u00a9 2023 -2024 Program Catalog. | achs.edu In effect 7/1/23 until superseded by a newer version. 184 Students wishing to drop a course may do so in any manner and may want to also discuss options with their student services advisor at 800.487.8839 or ema il stuserv@achs.edu . Requests to drop a course should be sent to Student Services via email to stuserv@achs.edu ; phone or fax to 800.487.8839; or mailed to ACHS, 5005 S. Macadam Ave, Portland, OR 97239. A student may be required to purchase updated materials when the course is rescheduled if materials have been updated for the n ext intake. A student's financial account must be in good standing to schedule the course for the next semester. Students will be charged for the current tuition and fees at the time of re -registration. ACHS cannot guarantee that space will be available in the next intake. In this case, an alternate course in the student's program may be recommended. Program When it is necessary for active students to take a temporary break from their academic program, they should apply for an academic Leave of Absence (L OA) from ACHS. An LOA is defined as a temporary break from academic registration for those with a clear intent to return to the program of study. Upon return from the LOA, a student is not required to apply for readmission to the college. Students may apply for an LOA for a period of up to 12 months and must provide an expected date of return. The applicant may be asked to provide documentation regarding the reason for the leave. Circumstances justifying a leave include but are not limited to: persona l or family medical conditions call to active military duty (also see ACHS's Military Deferral Policy) maternity or paternity leave, or death in immediate family. A student's financial account must be in good standing to be eligible to request a leave of absence. Students considering an LOA must contact their student advisor to discuss strategies to help them continue their studies prior to requesting the LOA. To apply for an LOA, students should submit the Leave of Absence Request form located at: tinyurl.com/y4ub56pv . American College of Healthcare Sciences \u00a9 2023 -2024 Program Catalog. | achs.edu In effect 7/1/23 until superseded by a newer version. 185 Note: Students on a leave of absence are considered withdrawn for the purposes of federal financial aid and will be provided with exit counseling. Students with student loans should confer with their loan provider before requesting a leave of absence to ascertain the consequences of a leave on their loan status. Military Deferral ACHS understands that military students, veterans, or military spouses may face additional challenges in pursing their education, and ACHS is committed to their success. If there is a change in a military student or spouse's military status, such as being called to active duty, they should first contact their student services advisor to discuss their studies. Students can contact their advisor at 800.487.8839 or via email to stuserv@achs.edu . ACHS will seek to find the best solution to help students in these situations to successfully complete their program. Options include: For students who will continue to have Internet access: Students may continue in their program as usual. If practical materials will not be available (i.e., herbs, essential oils, etc.) students may complete the assessments that do not require labs to receive full credit. For students who will not continue to have Internet access: Students may request a deferral of their current course(s) until their return, or until such time as they have Internet access, at no charge. The remainder of their program may also be placed on hold for the l ength of their documented service or deployment. For students who are required to withdraw from their program: Students shall receive non -punitive withdrawals in all courses. Any student required to withdraw due to being called to active duty shall be given priority in enrollment in the program of their choice upon return to the institution for the two semesters immediately following their discharge from active duty. The ASC has the discretion to waive or suspend any College policy or regulation that negati vely impacts students in their withdrawal or subsequent readmission to the College due to a call to active duty service. Netiquette American College of Healthcare Sciences \u00a9 2023 -2024 Program Catalog. | achs.edu In effect 7/1/23 until superseded by a newer version. 186 \"Netiquette\" is the term used to describe the social code of network communication. It becomes crucially important in onli ne courses since they do not include any \"face -to- face\" interaction with all communication being conducted via written words (emails and discussion boards). Online courses also lack non -verbal communication, such as body language, facial expressions, and v oice interactions, making it easier to misunderstand words. More information about netiquette is provided to students in the ACHS Online Orientation and Student Center. Non-Discrimination American College of Healthcare Sciences is committed to equal oppo rtunity and equal treatment for all qualified individuals. The College will not discriminate against any person because of age, gender, gender -identity, color, race, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, veteran st atus, or any other class protected by law. Petitioning for Deviation from Standard Program (Course Substitution) The purpose behind all academic program requirements is to preserve the integrity of the program. At times, a student might request a deviation from the standard program requirements. Any modifications of academic programs or waivers of requirements are granted only after careful consideration by the Academic Standards Committee (ASC), including review by the chief academic officer and f aculty as applicable. Please note the following: If a student requests to substitute courses, the requested courses must be at the same level or higher than the original courses in the program (for example, a 200-level course can be substituted for a 100 -level course but not vice -versa). All prerequisites must be met for substituted courses, unless explicitly waived by the ASC. All original program learning outcomes must still be able to be met. Procedure for Submission of Petition for Deviation from Standard Program 1. Enrolled students should contact their student advisor to discuss the reasons for seeking a modification of the academic program or waiver of academic American College of Healthcare Sciences \u00a9 2023 -2024 Program Catalog. | achs.edu In effect 7/1/23 until superseded by a newer version. 187 requirements. The advisor will direct the student to complete ACHS's Acad emic Petition requesting Deviation from Standard Program with all relevant supporting documents. The ACHS Petition can be accessed online h ere. 2. The petition will be reviewed by the Program Dean and may include consultation with faculty and other Academic Standards Committee members as needed to ensure the program -level outcomes will still be able to be met. 3. The student is notified of the Committee's decision by email, telephone, text, or mail. Program Transfer Policy Students considering transferring programs are asked to speak with their student services advisor. Students who would like to transfer progr ams should complete the ACHS Standard Petition for review by the Academic Standards Committee. Students must be in good academic and financial standing to be eligible to transfer. Students who drop a course as part of their transfer will have the refund policy applied to that course as set out in this Catalog. Note that students will pay the registration f or the new program if the transfer is approved. Only one transfer per person will be permitted. No transfers to third parties are permitted. Provisions for Undergraduate Student to Take Graduate -Level Courses An undergraduate student may take up to nine credits of graduate -level courses and must meet the following criteria: 1. The student must have an overall grade point average of 3.0 or better through the preceding term, or most recent instit ution if not currently an ACHS student . 2. The student must meet the prerequisites for the course. The following additional parameters apply: If the student wishes to earn graduate -level credit, he/she must pay the graduate tuition rate. If the student wishes to earn undergraduate -level credit, he/she may pay the unde rgraduate tuition rate. The graduate credit may be used to satisfy elective or core requirements in the undergraduate program. The student may apply a maximum of nine graduate credit hours toward undergraduate requirements. American College of Healthcare Sciences \u00a9 2023 -2024 Program Catalog. | achs.edu In effect 7/1/23 until superseded by a newer version. 188 Graduate students receive prior ity enrollment in graduate -level courses. Earning graduate credits as an undergraduate is not a guarantee of future admission into any graduate program at the American College of Healthcare Sciences. Readmission Students who voluntarily withdraw, must apply for readmission to ACHS through the Office of Admissions, meeting the current admissions requirements, and subject to approval by the Academic Standards Committee (ASC). Administratively withdrawn students who do not apply for reinstat ement within one year of the withdrawal date must also apply for readmission. Readmission does not change the student's original entry date. At the time of re -entry, the student's academic records will be evaluated in order to determine if it is possible for a satisfactory cumulative grade point to be achieved and for the program to be completed within the maximum time frame of 150%. If both of these standards can be achieved and the student has demonstrated an ability to benefit from the program, the stud ent may be readmitted under the current catalog and program requirements, and may be eligible for Title IV funds upon re -enrollment (federal financial aid requirements apply). After being readmitted to ACHS, any student not maintaining satisfactory acad emic progress each semester thereafter will be administratively withdrawn from ACHS and will not be eligible for readmission. Students will receive written notification of administrative withdrawal. Reinstatement Program Students who interrupt their studies by officially withdrawing from the College are eligible to apply for reinstatement within one year of withdrawal. All other students are required to apply for readmission.

This policy is in effect for all students including students who receive Title IV federal financial aid and non -Title IV students. This policy also applies across all categories of students at all rates of pursuit (full -time, part -time, etc ) and all programs that award academic credit; students in all classifications and programs that award academic credit are treated the same. At the end of each semester, grade -point averages and rate of completion are calculated to determine academic and financial aid standings. Students are notified of their academic and financial aid standing via the primary telephone number, email address, or mailing address provided by the student and recorded on the student record. Students can view their current c ontact information in the student portal at portal.achs.edu. Requests to update contact information may be sent to the Registrar's Office at registrar@achs.edu by phone to 800 -487-8839, or submitted via the online portal. Students may also submit a change of address online at https://achs.edu/change -of-address/. The Academic Standards Committee (ASC) is responsible for enforcement of the Satisfactory Academic Standing regulations and has discretionary authority to grant exceptions and to develop guideli nes for administering these regulations. How Satisfactory Academic Progress is Reviewed ACHS expects all students to maintain satisfactory academic progress (SAP) toward completion of their enrolled program. At the end of each semester, grade -point averages and rate of completion are calculated to determine academic standings. SAP has two components all students must meet in order to remain in good academic standing: American College of Healthcare Sciences \u00a9 2023 -2024 Program Catalog. | achs.edu In effect 7/1/23 until superseded by a newer version. 191 Grade Point Average - This qualitative standard requires students to achieve and maintain a cumulative GPA (CGPA) - 2.0 for undergraduate students and 3.0 for gra duate students. Completion Rate (or Pace) - This quantitative standard requires students to complete at least 67% (minimum pace) of ALL attempted courses. Also called \"pace\", this is a student's earned (completed) hours divided by his/her total attempted hours. For example, 42 credits earned/48 attempted credits = 87.5%. Students receiving Title IV federal financial aid must meet the above requirements in addition to the following in order to maintain satisfactory academic progress and remain eligible fo r federal financial aid: Participation : Students receiving federal financial aid are required to participate in substantive interaction with faculty. Students are required to establish participation within the first 14 days of the semester to be eligible to receive federal financial aid for th e semester, and Title IV funds are then disbursed for a student under the assumption that the student will participate for the entire period for which the assistance is awarded. Maximum Timeframe : Students have 150% of the time it takes to complete their program and remain eligible for financial aid (if applicable). This is measured in credits and reviewed at the end of each payment period. For students with a financial aid appeal, the maximum timeframe is also reviewed for future semesters to ensure the s tudent will be able to regain good standing within the maximum time frame allowed. For example, an Associate Degree requires 60 credit hours to complete, which means students would have a MAXIMUM of 90 attempted credit hours to complete their degree before they are no longer eligible to receive financial aid. Additional examples are provided in the chart below: Program Level Maximum Time Frame (attempted credits) Associate of Applied Science Degree - 60 credits 90 credits Undergraduate Certificate - 12-18 credits 18-27 credits Undergraduate Diploma - 27-42 credits 41-63 credits Bachelors Degree - 120 credits 180 credits Graduate Certificate - 12-15 credits 18-23 credits Masters Degree - 36 credits 54 credits Doctorate Degree - 60 credits 90 credits American College of Healthcare Sciences \u00a9 2023 -2024 Program Catalog. | achs.edu In effect 7/1/23 until superseded by a newer version. 192 Participation and Maximum Time Frame are reviewed at the end of each semester. Note, participation is also reviewed during the census period following the first 14 days of class to ensure all students are eligible for federal financial aid as described above. Continuous Enrollment ACHS students are expected to study continuously, i.e. take a course in each semester as applicable to their program, in order to remain in good academic standing. Students who need to interrupt their studies for personal or medical reasons may petition fo r an approved leave of absence using the ACHS Leave of Absence Form . Students who do not apply for and r eceive an approved leave of absence and do not earn credit after three semesters will be administratively withdrawn. Academic Standings Academic standings are determined once SAP is calculated at the end of each semester. In all instances the length of ac ademic standing, also referred to as the probationary period, shall be one semester unless notified otherwise. Students will be notified of their academic standing status by telephone, email, or mail. They will then need to meet (in person or via telepho ne) with their student services advisor to discuss tools and strategies for future success. Students placed on academic probation may have their registration restricted and are required to have regular meetings (by phone or conferencing technology) with th eir student services advisor throughout the following semester. NOTE: Any student who is not on Academic Warning, Academic Probation, or Academic Suspension is considered in good academic standing. Academic Warning : This occurs after the first semester t he student does not meet SAP. Students who attain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 (undergraduate) or 3.0 (graduate) or better and a completion rate of at least 67% in the subsequent semester will be removed from Academic Warning. Students should meet with their st udent services advisor to discuss strategies to regain good standing. This might include weekly or bi -weekly meetings, for instance. Academic Probation : This occurs after the second consecutive semester that the student did not meet SAP. Students who attai n a cumulative GPA of 2.0 American College of Healthcare Sciences \u00a9 2023 -2024 Program Catalog. | achs.edu In effect 7/1/23 until superseded by a newer version. 193 (undergraduate) or 3.0 (graduate) or better and a completion rate of at least 67% in the subsequent semester will be removed from Academic Probation. Academic Suspension : This occurs after the third consecutive semester that the student did not meet SAP, and after a successful appeal. Student eligibility is reinstated for one semester (or more with an academic plan). An appeal requires an academic plan and submission of an appeal online at https://contact.achs.edu/academic -appeal. Students are asked to be specific in their appeal and include all information they would like the ASC to consider. Academic Suspension Appeal Academic suspension appeals are individually reviewed by the ASC, and students are notified via email, phone, or letter of the Committee's decision within 30 days of receipt of the appeal. The committee's decision is final. Students who do not successfully appeal or who do not meet the terms of their academic plan will be administratively withdrawn. Admini strative withdrawal is recorded on the student's academic record. Students who are administratively withdrawn are no longer enrolled students and must apply for reinstatement or readmission as applicable, subject to approval by the ASC. Reinstatement Administratively withdrawn students can apply for reinstatement within one year of their withdrawal effective date. If accepted, reinstatement will be approved on a provisional basis and students will be required to successfully complete nine semester credits of individual courses with a 2.0 GPA for undergraduate and 3.0 GPA for graduate studies or better to demonstrate good academic standing prior to full reinstatement into an ACHS program. Financial Aid Standings If a review of a financial aid student' s record at the end of the semester indicates that they have not met SAP (qualitative, quantitative, participation, and maximum time frame requirements), the student may be placed on financial aid warning or probation and aid may be cancelled with continue d failure to meet SAP according to the following schedule: Financial Aid Warning : This occurs after the first semester the student does not meet SAP. Students will need to meet with their academic advisor to identify American College of Healthcare Sciences \u00a9 2023 -2024 Program Catalog. | achs.edu In effect 7/1/23 until superseded by a newer version. 194 how ACHS can help. Recommendations mig ht be weekly meetings, tutoring, or working with a peer tutor, for instance. Students will remain eligible for federal student aid for one additional semester, after which SAP will again be reviewed. If a student is still not meeting SAP after a second con secutive semester, they will be required to appeal in order to be considered for continued financial aid eligibility. Financial Aid Probation: This occurs after the second consecutive semester that the student did not meet SAP, and after a successful appea l. Student eligibility is reinstated for one payment period (or more with an academic plan). Cancellation of Aid: If a student's cumulative grade point average and/or completion rate is less than the minimum standard after the Probation period and/or the student does not meet the terms of their academic plan, the student's financial aid will be cancelled. Financial aid eligibility may only be reinstated once the student is again meeting SAP. Students have the option to appeal the cancellation of their fi nancial aid. An appeal requires an academic plan and submission of appeal online at contact.achs.edu/financial -aid-warning -appeal . Students are asked to be specific in their appeal and include all information they would like the Financial Aid (FAC) to consider. In certain situations, an appeal may be warranted, including, but not limited to, the following: Medical emergencies Severe health issues Severe personal or family problems Financial or personal catastrophe Financial aid appeals are individually reviewed by Program Deans, and students are notified in writing of the decision within 30 days of receipt of the appeal; these decisions are final. If aid is canceled, students may continue to take courses at their own expense with approval from the ASC, as students on financial aid cancellation are also on academic suspension, until they have regained good academic standing by achieving a min imum cumulative GPA of 2.0 for undergraduate students or 3.0 for graduate students AND meeting the minimum pace by completing 67% of their total attempted credits.

Student Identity Verification ACHS is committed to ensuring that the admitted student is the same student who completes all ACHS coursework and assessment and is the same student who is awarded credit. ACHS's student identity verification policy and practices begin with the admissions process and continue throughout the student's education to graduation. Upon enrollment, ACHS requires students to provide a copy of a v alid government - issued ID. This ID is kept in the student's permanent academic record and referenced for identity verification during proctored assessments. Students are also issued a unique login and passcode at the time of enrollment used to access all A CHS systems including the student's ACHS email and online classes. Student Records The College maintains records for each student. Student records include the student's enrollment application and agreement, semester registration contract(s), any person al information necessary for the College's business, transcripts, comments, evaluations, letters of concern and appreciation, and records of any College action. College staff and the applicable regulatory agencies have access to student files for education al and business purposes. Third -party access to student records is limited unless the student has provided written consent. Students have rights of inspection and correction of their records. Student information of a private, personal, or confidential natu re that is provided to the College will only be disclosed in compliance within the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Information required for transcripts of all former students is permanently retained. As an Institute of Higher Learning, the federal rules provided by FERPA govern student privacy. FERPA requires that ACHS maintains the confidentiality of academic and personal records of each student.

The Department of Education has determined the Solomon Amendment supersedes most elements of FERPA. An institution i s therefore obligated to release data included in the list of \"student recruiting information,\" which may or may not match ACHS's FERPA directory information list. However, if the student has submitted a request to ACHS's Registrar's Office to restrict the release of his/her directory information, then no information from the student's education record will be released under the Solomon Amendment.

Students may wish to appoint a parent, spouse, or friend, but should be sure to select someone they trust. ACHS may freely deal with this person as if t hey are the student. Students may assign an authorized agent or update their agent by submitting the ACHS Authorized Agent form available at tinyurl.com/authorized -agent . Please note that the ACHS Credit Card Authorization form completed by the cardholder when students use a third -party credit card does not constitute an authorized agent.

It is no t possible to list all the forms of behavior that are considered unacceptable. The following are examples of infractions of rules of conduct that may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal from ACHS: All forms of dishonesty, including misrepresenting qualifications Any physical abuse or harassment including bullying both in person and/or online The use of language, graphics, or images that are offensive or do not contribute to scholarly discourse. Obstruction or disruption of College ac tivities Theft or inappropriate removal or possession of property Falsification of records Possession, distribution, sale, transfer, or use of alcohol or illegal drugs while on campus Gratuitous use of graphics or images that may be considered offensive a nd/or do not directly contribute to further learning in the classroom.

Our goal is always to foster fra nk discussion and to respect academic freedom; however, forums may not be used to endorse or sell products, solicit students for other programs, share political views or the work of other students without their expressed permission, or other unrelated disc ussions. Posts that are not directly related to holistic health or that may be inflammatory will be removed at the discretion of ACHS. ACHS recognizes that students may have interests in events and organizations outside the College and are welcome to submit events for posting on the college calendar (students can also post events to ACHS's Student Center in Canvas). Students may not solicit or distribute literature concerning these activities via email. Key points for a successful forum experience: Use email rather than discussion boards or forums to send personal messages directly to student(s) or professors. Include a descriptive \"Subject\" heading as the first line. Use the help desk or contact ACHS for assistance with technical issues. Respect each other's ideas, feelings, and experience. If students disagree with someone's point of view, argue ideas rather than attacking individuals or groups. Derogatory statements about minorities, sexual or gender identity, sexual orientation, profess ions, personal characters, practices, or beliefs, and individually aimed insults or threats that cause any participant to feel discomfort will not be tolerated. Explore disagreements and support assertions with data and evidence. Compose carefully reasoned comments. Introducing apparently contradictory information can be very helpful in exploring the topic. Try to always analyze what the student read and discuss why they agree or disagree with the author of the opposing view. Do not advertise. Commercial -type information is not permitted. Do not post copyrighted material. Instead, post URLs to Web content or cite reference information (title, publisher, etc.).

ACHS values student comments and feedback and loves hearing from students. Corrective Meet ings Correct meetings are used in the event there is a code of conduct violation or any other disciplinary action. Anyone may request a corrective meeting. A request for a corrective meeting can be submitted in any manner and should be directed to the dire ctor of academic services when possible. The director of academic services or nominee coordinates the corrective meeting. They will give notice by phone, email, text, or mail to the student (or to their guardian if the student is a minor) to meet for a cor rective meeting. A corrective meeting may be held in person, by telephone, or online. If the student does not meet as requested, a decision may be made in the student's absence. At the corrective meeting, the student and the College official will review the situation and discuss possible action. The College official will provide the student with an opportunity to respond and discuss this response. The College official will inform the student of ACHS's decision with respect to the situation within 30 busin ess days of the meeting and sooner when possible. The results of the corrective meeting are binding. Forms of Discipline The College official may impose the following forms of discipline following a corrective meeting: Reprimand : Written or verbal notice that a student's conduct in a specific instance does not meet ACHS standards and that continued misconduct may result in a more serious disciplinary action. Probation : Notice that the student found in violation of ACHS standards may continue to be enrolled under stated conditions, violations of which may be cause for more serious disciplinary action. Restitution : Reimbursement for damage to, or misappropriation of property, which may take the form of appropriate service to repair or otherwise compensate for damages. The College official may impose restitution with any other penalty. Dismissal : For serious offences, the College official may dismiss a student from the College.
