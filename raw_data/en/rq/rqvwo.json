But holistic treatment centers can see why Rodgers did it, because of the way it can boost one's immunity. When asked if he's been vaccinated two months ago, Rodgers said he was immunized. \"And that probably meant that he built his immune system up. I don't think he was lying. He was just saying listen, I got my body so that it can fight. I think he's a natural-minded person,\" said Curry Chaudoir with Acupuncture & Holistic Health Associates in Glendale. We don't know specifics about Rodgers' treatment, but Chaudoir says, \"It was probably some remedy that triggered the immune system response that would put the body in a better state, to number one, fight the problem from happening in the first place.\" An example: Using homeopathic poison ivy to treat skin conditions that result in conditions similar to poison ivy. \"Homeopathic poison ivy in very minute dosages. One part poison ivy to literally millions of parts of grain alcohol would then make it so the body would fight poison ivy-like symptoms or poison ivy itself,\" said Chaudoir. But is it effective in preventing Covid-19? Medical doctors say no. \"There are no homeopathic treatments. There are no special herbs or potions that have been proposed for Covid, and things even like medical drugs, like Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine, just don't work for the prevention of Covid. That's well established,\" said Dr. Gregory DeMuri, UW pediatric infectious disease specialist. Dr. Demuri also challenges Rodgers' use of the word \"immunized.\" \"The terms don't make sense medically to a medical practitioner. Immunized and vaccinated mean the same thing. We should hold our government to the standard that the vaccine is safe, but I think when they do, and the scientific community determines that it's safe and effective, then we have to believe them,\" "}
