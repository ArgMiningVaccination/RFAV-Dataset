Contemporary clinical trials 2015 Studies from low-income countries report positive non-specific effects of early Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) immunisation on childhood health and survival. Neonatal immunisation with BCG may prime the immune system and offer partial protection against other infectious and possibly allergic diseases. The potential clinical value of these non-specific effects has not yet been examined in a large randomised trial in high-income countries. The Danish Calmette Study is a multicentre randomised clinical trial conducted between October 2012 and November 2015. Within the first 7days of life, infants were randomly assigned to intra-dermal vaccination with BCG or no intervention. At 3 and 13months of age structured telephone interviews and clinical examinations of the children were conducted. In a subgroup of children blood samples were drawn and stool samples collected at age 4days, 3 and 13months. Thymus index was assessed by ultrasound in a subgroup at randomisation and at 3months.

We investigated whether birth weight and other factors are determinants of neonatal BCG vaccination in order to identify infants underserved by vaccination. Methods We used logistic regression to calculate adjusted ORs (AORs) for the association between birth weight (categorised as non-low birth weight (NLBW) (2.50 kg) and low birth weight (LBW) (2-2.49 kg, 1.50-1.99 kg and <1.50 kg)) and non-vaccination with BCG at the end of the neonatal period (0-27 days). We assessed whether this association varied by place of delivery and infant illness. We calculated how BCG timing and uptake would improve by ensuring the vaccination of all facility-born infants prior to discharge.
