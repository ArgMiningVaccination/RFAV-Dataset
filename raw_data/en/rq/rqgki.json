The Vaccine Quarterly 2009;3[1]:17 Alternative Vaccine Schedule Argument The Truth Parents can educate themselves to know more than doctors. Advisory committees are composed of experts who review the primary data. Government and pharmaceutical companies conspire to misrepresent data. There is no evidence of conspiracy. Natural immunity is better than vaccine-induced immunity. The cost of natural immunity is the risk of serious disease or death. Vaccines are not adequately tested for safety. Vaccines are among the most thoroughly tested pharmaceuticals in the world. Vaccines are recommended for protection of the public, not individuals. Individuals benefit from vaccines through both individual and herd immunity. There is a middle ground between causality and coincidence. Either vaccines do or don't cause certain adverse events. Science fails because it cannot prove that vaccines don't cause adverse events. Science can only reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. Offit.
