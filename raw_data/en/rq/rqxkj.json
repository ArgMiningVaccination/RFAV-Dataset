[Between 7000 and 4000 BCE](https://fragranceconservatory.com/history-of-fragrance), in Mesopotamia, people would burn fragrant resins to bring royals and priests closer to their gods. During the same period, Egyptians found out how to store fragrances in fats. Thanks to this discovery, they started making fragrant oils and balms that people would use for personal care and in funeral and [religious rituals](https://historicaleve.com/perfume-of-ancient-egyptians/). The use of perfume was then incorporated into [various cultures](https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-perfume-1991657) around the world, including in Ancient China, India and around the Mediterranean. The rise of Christianity brought about a decline in perfume usage in Europe, but the Muslim world kept the tradition alive and helped export it overseas. In the [16th century](https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-perfume-1991657), perfumes became extremely popular in France among the upper classes. Then, the industry continued to grow, especially thanks to the invention of the eau de Cologne two centuries later. Nowadays, [41%](https://www.statista.com/chart/24712/perfume-use-by-country/) of Americans use perfume regularly, and the industry is worth billions of dollars. However, most perfumes sold these days are full of harmful chemicals that we should not be breathing in or putting on our skin. Fortunately, the 10 sustainable perfume brands we have selected for this article are an exception! They are making non-toxic scents that we can enjoy every day without hurting our health or the planet. HOW TO CHOOSE NON-TOXIC PERFUMES? The main issue with perfumes is that the perfume industry is incredibly opaque, and we rarely know what they are formulated with. [FDA regulations](https://the-ethos.co/best-clean-perfume-brands/) do not apply to perfumes and fragrances, which means that companies are not required to disclose what their products contain. Perfume formulas are usually proprietary information, so instead of listing all their ingredients, many brands hide some of them behind the word \"fragrance\". The problem is that perfumes containing \"fragrance\" can be formulated with hundreds of ingredients, many of which can cause health complications in the long run. They are often made with [hormone disruptors](https://womensvoices.org/fragrance-ingredients/report-unpacking-the-fragrance-industry/), carcinogens and other toxic chemicals that are very harmful to human health. Unfortunately, if a perfume brand decided not to disclose its entire ingredient list, we cannot know whether the product we buy is safe for us. So it is crucial to choose perfumes made by a transparent brand that always discloses all its ingredients. What's more, we should buy perfumes formulated with safe ingredients. To do so, always read the ingredient list and check what the ingredients are. If you cannot find what the perfume is made with, avoid buying it. In general, [clean perfume brands](https://the-ethos.co/best-clean-perfume-brands/) make their perfumes with plant-based alcohol bases and essential oils. Avoid perfumes with an ethanol base because ethanol production causes many [environmental issues](https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/20080729_23361EPONo3_g.pdf). Other [harmful chemicals](https://alitura.com/blogs/skinsupport/the-top-10-toxic-chemicals-in-perfumes-and-cologne) to avoid in Linalool These are some of the most toxic ingredients you can find in perfumes, but many others are also problematic. So always research the ingredients before buying perfumes, and make sure they are safe. WHAT MAKES PERFUMES SUSTAINABLE? In addition to choosing non-toxic perfumes, you might want to buy more sustainable options. Eco-friendly perfumes are made by brands that take action to reduce their environmental footprint, at every stage of the production process. These brands prefer to use responsibly-sourced ingredients over raw materials that are usually [over-harvested](https://ecocult.com/sustainable-non-toxic-perfume-brands/), even if it means using (safe) synthetics. They try to minimize their waste as much as possible and make ethical manufacturing their priority. If you are looking for sustainable options, also make sure to choose a perfume that comes in a recyclable glass bottle. Some brands even make their bottles from recycled glass, and others offer refillable bottles that you can return afterward. Try to avoid bottles with plastic pumps and cellophane wraps.
