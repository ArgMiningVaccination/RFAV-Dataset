English Language Arts and Reading, Grade 3, Beginning with School Year 2009- 2010. (a) Introduction. (1) The English Language Arts and Reading Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) are organized into the following strands: Reading, where students read and understand a wide variety of literary and informational texts; Writing, where students compose a variety of written texts with a clear controlling idea, coherent organization, and sufficient detail; Research, where students are expected to know how to locate a range of relevant sources and evaluate, synthesize, and present ideas and information; Listening and Speaking, where students listen and respond to the ideas of others while contributing their own ideas in conversations and in groups; and Oral and Written Conventions, where students learn how to use the oral and written conventions of the English language in speaking and writing. The standards are cumulative-- students will continue to address earlier standards as needed while they attend to standards for their grade. In third grade, students will engage in activities that build on their prior knowledge and skills in order to strengthen their reading, writing, and oral language skills. Students should read and write on a daily basis. (2) For students whose first language is not English, the students' native language serves as a foundation for English language acquisition. (A) English language learners (ELLs) are acquiring English, learning content in English, and learning to read simultaneously. For this reason, it is imperative that reading instruction should be comprehensive and that students receive instruction in phonemic awareness, phonics, decoding, and word attack skills while simultaneously being taught academic vocabulary and comprehension skills and strategies. Reading instruction that enhances ELL's ability to decode unfamiliar words and to make sense of those words in context will expedite their ability to make sense of what they read and learn from reading. Addi tionally, developing fluency, spelling, and grammatical conventions of academic language must be done in meaningful contexts and not in isolation. (B) For ELLs, comprehension of texts requires additional scaffolds to support comprehensible input. ELL stude nts should use the knowledge of their first language (e.g., cognates) to further vocabulary development. Vocabulary needs to be taught in the context of connected discourse so that language is meaningful. ELLs must learn how revised August 201 7 2 rhetorical devices in English differ from those in their native language. At the same time English learners are learning in English, the focus is on academic English, concepts, and the language structures specific to the content. (C) During initial stages of English development, ELLs ar e expected to meet standards in a second language that many monolingual English speakers find difficult to meet in their native language. However, English language learners' abilities to meet these standards will be influenced by their proficiency in Engli sh. While English language learners can analyze, synthesize, and evaluate, their level of English proficiency may impede their ability to demonstrate this knowledge during the initial stages of English language acquisition. It is also critical to understand that ELLs with no previous or with interrupted schooling will require explicit and strategic support as they acquire English and learn to learn in English simultaneously. (3) To meet Public Education Goal 1 of the Texas Education Code, \u00a74.002, which stat es, \"The students in the public education system will demonstrate exemplary performance in the reading and writing of the English language,\" students will accomplish the essential knowledge, skills, and student expectations at Grade 3 as described in subsection (b) of this section. (4) To meet Texas Education Code, \u00a728.002(h), which states, \"... each school district shall foster the continuation of the tradition of teaching United States and Texas history and the free enterprise system in regular subject matter and in reading courses and in the adoption of textbooks,\" students will be provided oral and written narratives as well as other informational texts that can help them to become thoughtful, active citizens who appreciate the basic democratic values of our state and nation.

Mathematics, Grade 3, Adopted 2012. (a) Introduction. (1) The desire to achieve educational excellence is the driving force behind the Texas essential knowledge and skills for mathematics, guided by the college and career readiness standards. By embedding statistics, probabi lity, and finance, while focusing on computational thinking, mathematical fluency, and solid understanding, Texas will lead the way in mathematics education and prepare all Texas students for the challenges they will face in the 21st century. (2) The proce ss standards describe ways in which students are expected to engage in the content. The placement of the process standards at the beginning of the knowledge and skills listed for each grade and course is intentional. The process standards weave the other k nowledge and skills together so that students may be successful problem solvers and use mathematics efficiently and effectively in daily life. The process standards are integrated at every grade level and course. When possible, students will apply mathemat ics to problems arising in everyday life, society, and the workplace. Students will use a problem -solving model that incorporates analyzing given information, formulating a plan or strategy, determining a solution, justifying the solution, and evaluating t he problem -solving process and the reasonableness of the solution. Students will select appropriate tools such as real objects, manipulatives, algorithms, paper and pencil, and technology and techniques such as mental math, estimation, number sense, and ge neralization and revised August 201 7 11 abstraction to solve problems. Students will effectively communicate mathematical ideas, reasoning, and their implications using multiple representations such as symbols, diagrams, graphs, computer programs, and language. Students will use mathematical relationships to generate solutions and make connections and predictions. Students will analyze mathematical relationships to connect and communicate mathematical ideas. Students will display, explain, or justify mathematical ideas and arguments using precise mathematical language in written or oral communication. (3) For students to become fluent in mathematics, students must develop a robust sense of number. The National Research Council's report, \"Adding It Up,\" defines procedural fluency a s \"skill in carrying out procedures flexibly, accurately, efficiently, and appropriately.\" As students develop procedural fluency, they must also realize that true problem solving may take time, effort, and perseverance. Students in Grade 3 are expected to perform their work without the use of calculators. (4) The primary focal areas in Grade 3 are place value, operations of whole numbers, and understanding fractional units. These focal areas are supported throughout the mathematical strands of number and operations, algebraic reasoning, geometry and measurement, and data analysis. In Grades 3 -5, the number set is limited to positive rational numbers. In number and operations, students will focus on applying place value, comparing and ordering whole numbers, connecting multiplication and division, and understanding and representing fractions as numbers and equivalent fractions. In algebraic reasoning, students will use multiple representations of problem situations, determine missing values in number sentences, and represent real -world relationships using number pairs in a table and verbal descriptions. In geometry and measurement, students will identify and classify two -dimensional figures according to common attributes, decompose composite figures formed by rectangles to determine area, determine the perimeter of polygons, solve problems involving time, and measure liquid volume (capacity) or weight.

Science, Grade 3, Beginning with School Year 2010- 2011. (a) Introduction. (1) Science, as defined by the National Academy of Sciences, is the \"use of evidence to construct testable explanations and predictions of natural phenomena, as well as the knowledge generated through this process.\" (2) Recurring themes are pervasive in sciences, mathematics, and technology. These ideas transcend disciplinary boundaries and include patterns, cycles, systems, models, and change and constancy. revised August 201 7 16 (3) The study of elementary science includes planning and safely implementing classroom and outdoor investigations using scientific methods, analyzing information, making informed decisions, and using tools to collect and record information while addressing the content and vocabulary in physical, earth, and life sciences. Districts are encouraged to facilitate classroom and outdoor investigations for at least 60% of instructional time. (4) In Grade 3, students learn that the study of science uses appropriate tools and safe practices in planning and implementing investigations, asking and answering questions, collecting data by observing and measuring, and by using models to support scientific inquiry about the natural world. (A) Students recognize that patterns, relationships, and cycles exist in matter. Students will investigate the physical properties of matter and will learn that changes occur. They explore mixtures and investigate light, sound, and heat/thermal energy in everyday life. Students manipulate objects by pushi ng and pulling to demonstrate changes in motion and position. (B) Students investigate how the surface of Earth changes and provides resources that humans use. As students explore objects in the sky, they describe how relationships affect patterns and cycl es on Earth.
