If you have done this-You know it is rough. You feel, well-poopy. Then you start feeling better, as your body flushes and your body becomes clean, you remember why you went through all the trouble. You feel not only Clean -but- Energized, Refreshed, Light-Amazing! Your Chakras and your Aura hold energy. When Energy has blocks (ie. Life Happens), your Chakras and Aura become blocked/mis-shaped. They overflow or run tight or slow down or stretch wide and life feels chaotic. Much like the picture here. When an Energy healing is given the energy that is no longer serving you and or energy that you picked up that isn't yours-begins to let go. Your Energy starts to sync to your true state. This is the hardest part. We feel a Spiritual Detox because we are over-flowed with the energy release or we resist letting go. (I know I am guilty of not wanting to let go.)

Do it again until you feel the release. If you need somewhere to let it go- [visit my Letting Go page](https://sayreiki.com/letting-go/). What is Next. . . Realizing you are and always have been connected to the Supreme Being. God. That you have a Divine Truth within You. Always Shining. Always Connected. Your True Self. And-Now. . . All the Clouds have Cleared! -Energy Healing Is- Shifting your Energy. Releasing. Healing. Growing. Glowing! Remember: Life happens to all of us.

You will become more aware of your energy and will recognize when you have blockages and you will be able to clear them or even keep them from sticking in your energy space at all. "}
