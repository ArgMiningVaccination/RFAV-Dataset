A B S T R A C T Background Manipulation and mobilisation are commonly used to treat neck pain. This is an update of a Cochrane review rst published in 2 003, and previously updated in 2010. Objectives T o assess the effects of manipulation or mobilisation alone co mpared wiith those of an inactive control or another active trea tment on pain, function, disability, patient satisfaction, qualit y of life and global perceived effect in adults experiencing neck pain with or without radicular symptoms and cervicogenic headache (CGH) at im mediate- to long-term follow-up. When appropriate, to assess t he influence of treatment characteristics (i.e. technique, dosage), m ethodological quality, symptom duration and subtypes of neck disorder on treatment outcomes. Search methods Review authors searched the following computerised database s to November 2014 to identify additional studies: the Cochra ne Central Register of Controlled T rials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literatur e (CINAHL). We also searched ClinicalT rials.gov , checked references, searched citations and contacted study autho rs to nd relevant studies. We updated this search in June 2015, but these result s have not yet been incorporated. 1 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) undertaken to assess whe ther manipulation or mobilisation improves clinical outcomes for adults with acute/subacute/chronic neck pain. Data collection and analysis T wo review authors independently selected studies, abstract ed data, assessed risk of bias and applied Grades of Recommend ation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methods (ver y low, low, moderate, high quality). We calculated pooled risk r atios (RRs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs). Main results We included 51 trials (2920 participants, 18 trials of manipula tion/mobilisation versus control; 34 trials of manipulatio n/mobilisation versus another treatment, 1 trial had two comparisons). Cervical manipulation versus inactive control: Forsubacute andchronic neck pain, a single manipulation (three trials, no meta- analysis, 154 participants, ranged from very low to low quali ty) relieved pain at immediate- but not short-term follow-up. Cervical manipulation versus another active treatment: Foracute andchronic neck pain, multiple sessions of cervical manipulation (two trials, 446 participants, ranged from moderate to high qu ality) produced similar changes in pain, function, quality of l ife (QoL), global perceived effect (GPE) and patient satisfaction when comp ared with multiple sessions of cervical mobilisation short- and intermediate-term follow-up. Foracute andsubacute neck pain, multiple sessions of cervical manipulation were more effective than certain medications in improving pain and functi on at immediate- (one trial, 182 participants, moderate quali ty) and long-term follow-up (one trial, 181 participants, moderate qua lity). These ndings are consistent for function at intermedia te-term follow-up (one trial, 182 participants, moderate quality). Forchronic CGH, multiple sessions of cervical manipulation (two trials, 1 25 participants, low quality) may be more effective than massage in improving pain and function at short/intermediate-term fo llow-up. Multiple sessions of cervical manipulation (one trial, 65 part icipants, very low quality) may be favoured over transcutaneo us electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for pain reduction at short-term fol low-up. Foracute neck pain, multiple sessions of cervical manipulation (one trial, 20 participants, very low quality) may be more effe ctive than thoracic manipulation in improving pain and short/ intermediate-term follow-up. Thoracic manipulation versus inactive control: Three trials (150 participants) using a single session were as sessed at immediate-, short- and intermediate-term follow-up. At short-term follow -up, manipulation improved pain in participants with acute andsubacute neck pain (ve trials, 346 participants, moderate quality, pooled SMD -1.26, 95% condence interval (CI) -1.86 to -0.66) and improved function (four trials, 258 participants, moderate quality, po oled SMD -1.40, 95% CI -2.24 to -0.55) in participants with acute and chronic neck pain. A funnel plot of these data suggests publication bias. T hese ndings were consistent at intermediate follow-up for pain/function/quality of life (one trial, 111 participants, l ow quality). Thoracic manipulation versus another active treatment: No studies provided sufcient data for statistical analyses. A single session of thoracic manipulation (one trial, 100 participants, modera te quality) was comparable with thoracic mobilisation for pai n relief at Mobilisation versus inactive control: a stand-alone intervention (two trials, 57 pa rticipants, ranged from very low to low quality) may not reduce pain more than an inactive control. Mobilisation versus another active treatment: Foracute andsubacute neck pain, anterior-posterior mobilisation (one trial, 95 participants, very low quality) may favour pain reduction ove r rotatory or transverse mobilisations at immediate-term fo joint (TMJ) dysfunction, multip le sessions of TMJ manual therapy (one trial, 38 participants, very low quality) may be more effective than cervical mobilisat ion in improving pain/function at immediate- Forsubacute alone (four trials, 165 participan ts, ranged from low to very low quality) may not be different from ultrasound, TENS, acupunct ure and massage in improving pain, function, QoL and participa nt satisfaction at immediate- and intermediate-term follow-up. Additionally, combining laser with manipulation may be supe rior to using manipulation or laser alone (one trial, 56 participants, very low quality). Authors' conclusions Although support can be found for use of thoracic manipulation versus control for neck pain, function and QoL, results for cervi cal manipulation and mobilisation versus control are few and div erse. Publication bias cannot be ruled out. Research designed t o protect against various biases is needed. 2 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Findings suggest that manipulation and mobilisation prese nt similar results for every outcome at immediate/short/int ermediate-term follow-up. Multiple cervical manipulation sessions may provi de better pain relief and functional improvement than certain medications at immediate/intermediate/long-term follow-up. Since the ri sk of rare but serious adverse events for manipulation exist s, further high- quality research focusing on mobilisation and comparing mobil isation or manipulation versus other treatment options is n eeded to guide clinicians in their optimal treatment choices. P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y Manipulation and mobilisation for neck disorders Review question This update assessed the effect of manipulation or mobilisat ion alone compared with a control or another treatment on pain, function, disability, patient satisfaction, quality of life and globa l perceived effect in adults experiencing neck pain with or witho ut arm symptoms and headache at immediate- to long-term follow-up. Background Neck pain can cause varying levels of disability for the affected individual and is a common musculoskeletal complaint. Neck pain can be accompanied by pain radiating down the arms (radiculopathy) or b y headache (cervicogenic headache). Manipulation (adjustments to the spine) and mobilisation (movement imposed on joints and m uscles) can be used alone or in combination with other physiothe rapies to treat neck pain. Study characteristics This updated review includes 51 trials: 18 trials contrasted m anipulation or mobilisation against no treatment or preten d treatment; 34 trials compared manipulation or mobilisation against anoth er treatment (electrotherapy, exercise, medication) and vario us techniques or dosages. [Note one trial included two comparison groups]. Key results Although other reviews focusing on adverse events suggest th at mobilisation is safe and manipulation may result in rare b ut serious side effects such as stroke, disc herniation or serious neurologica l decits, our review noted temporary and benign side effects w ith both approaches; more than half of the included trials did not repor t on adverse effects. Manipulation or mobilisation versus inactive treatment: For subacute/chronic neck pain, a single manipulation produced temporary pain relief. However, conflicting evidence was found at short-te rm follow-up for pain reduction with multiple sessions. At sho rt-term and intermediate-term follow-up, multiple sessions of thora cic manipulation were favoured for pain reduction among parti cipants with acute/subacute neck pain, and for functional improvement among those with acute to chronic neck pain. No additional pain relief was reported when thoracic mobilisation was used. Manipulation or mobilisation versus another active treatm ent:Cervical manipulation produced changes in pain, function, qual ity of life, global perceived effect and patient satisfaction that were comp arable with those attained with cervical mobilisation up to in termediate- term follow-up for patients with neck pain of any duration. Cer vical manipulation for acute/subacute neck pain was more effecti ve than varied combinations of analgesics, muscle relaxants and n on-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for improving pain and f unction at up to long-term follow-up. For chronic cervicogenic headache, ce rvical manipulation provided greater benet than light mass age in improving pain and function at short-term and intermediate -term follow-up. For chronic CGH, cervical manipulation may be superior to transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TEN S) in improving pain at short-term follow-up. For acute neck pain , cervical manipulation may be more effective than thoracic manipulatio n in improving pain and function up to intermediate-term follo w-up. Finally, for subacute and chronic neck pain, cervical mobilisati on appeared similar to pulsed ultrasound, TENS, acupuncture a nd massage in improving pain, function, quality of life and pati ent satisfaction up to intermediate-term follow-up. However, combining laser with manipulation may be superior to using manipulati on or laser alone. Quality of the evidence No high-quality evidence was found, so uncertainty about the ef fectiveness of mobilisation or manipulation for neck pain rem ains. Future research is likely to have an important impact on the eff ect estimate. Authors of this review encountered many challeng es, for 3 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Most people can expect to have some degree of neck pain within their lifetime. Neck pain with or wit h- out symptoms that radiate to the arms or head may involve a va- riety of pathologies in one or several neurovascular, soft ti ssue and musculoskeletal structures such as nerves, ganglia, nerve roo un- covertebral joints, intervertebral joints, discs, bones, pe riosteum, muscle and ligaments. We included in this review neck pain with cervicogenic headache - a pain that emanates from the neck and suboccipital region and radiates to the forehead, orbital reg ion, temples, vertex or ears and is aggravated by specic neck move- ments or sustained neck postures. When examining new episodes of neck pain, we looked at the gen- eral population, the workforce and motor vehicle accident (MVA) victims. Every year, an episode of neck pain occurs in 15% to 20% of the general population, in 15% to 60% of the work- force and in 10% to 14% of those involved in trafc collisions (Guzman 2008 ). Prevalence of neck pain varies from 12% to 72% in the general population and from 27% to 48% among workers (Haldeman 2008 ). The annual prevalence of activity limitations related to neck pain has been reported as 11% in the UK and 14%in Canada ( C\u00f4t\u00e9, 2008 ). Societal and personal burden from per- sisting symptoms of postwhiplash injury has been described i n up to 50% of those attending an emergency department ( Kongsted 2007 ). Long-term consequences for individuals and their spouses as detailed by Jennum 2013 include reduced quality of life, mood, ability to cope, social participation, employment rates and jo b in- come. Direct costs attributable to visits to healthcare providers, s ick leave and related loss of productive capacity ( Borghouts 1998 ;C\u00f4t\u00e9 2008 ;Linton 1998 ;Skargren 1998 ) are substantive. Mean in- flation-adjusted annual expenditures on medical care for peopl e with back and neck conditions increased from $487 to $950 USD from 1999 to 2008 ( Davis 2012 ). Work-related claims for neck injury submitted to a Canadian Workers Compensation Board accounted for 5% of all lost time at work ( C\u00f4t\u00e9 2008 ). Indirect costs related to disease-related work disability or prematur e mor- tality were signicantly higher in people with neck injury and their spouses when compared with matched controls in a Danish study (Jennum 2013 ). Description of the intervention Manipulation and mobilisation are commonly used treatments for neck pain and may be performed by physical therapists, chiropra c- tors, traditional bone setters, osteopaths, medical doctors and mas- 6 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.sage therapists. Manipulation consists of a localised force of high velocity and low amplitude directed at specic spinal segments (Basmajian 1993 Mobilisations use low-grade/ve- locity, small- or large-amplitude passive movement technique s or neuromuscular techniques within the patient's range of motio n and within the patient's control ( Basmajian 1993 ;Butler 2000 ; Grieve 1988 ). Neuromuscular mobilisation techniques employ the muscular efforts of individuals against a specic force applie d by the clinician to more effectively mobilise a joint(s) and relate d tis- sues. Description of the comparison The methods most commonly compared in trials are inactive con- trols [placebo (e.g. sham/mock mobilisation or other sham treat - ment such as sham transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS); adjunct treatment (e.g. mobilisation plus a treatment such as ultrasound versus same treatment); and wait list/no tr eat- ment)] and other active treatments [one intervention versus an - other intervention (e.g. manipulation versus exercise); one t reat- ment technique versus another (e.g. rotatory break versus lat eral break manipulation); and one dose of treatment versus anothe r dose (e.g. three weeks at nine sessions of manipulation versu s four weeks at 12 sessions)]. How the intervention might work Spinal manipulation or mobilisation appear to have three ma in proposed underpinning physiological mechanisms. The underl y- ing mechanisms are complex, multifactorial and poorly under- stood; unravelling these mechanisms continues to for rehabilitation. First, neurophysiol ogical ef- fects, including analgesic, motor and sympathetic nervous sys tem effects, have been demonstrated ( Bialosky 2009 ;Karason 2003 ; Perry 2008 ;Vincenzino 1996 ); second, mechanical effects, includ- ing transient/short-term to permanent change in length of con- nective tissue and biomechanical dysfunction, have been reveal ed (Bialosky 2009 ;Calloca 2006 ;Fritz 2011 ;Martinez-Segura 2006 ; Souvlis 2004 ); and nally, expectations or psychological factors associated with 'manual touch' may produce a placebo effect. The mechanical force of spinal manipulation triggers a chain of neu- rophysiological reactions that are thought to be the reason fo r the outcomes seen with spinal manipulation ( Bialosky 2009 ). Pro- posed neurophysiological effects include pain reduction throu gh inhibition of nociceptors, dorsal horn and descending pathway s of the spinal cord ( Bialosky 2009 ;Haavik 2012 ;Pickar 2002 ). can stimulate peripheral (Bialosky 2009 ;Schmid 2008 ). Increased muscle recruitment after manipulation has impacted spinal stiffness and muscle a ctiv- ity (Fritz 2011 ). It is difcult to assess to what degree 'hands-oneffects', attention, assessment techniques, other forms of f eedback and interaction and communication between the manual therapis t and the patient are 'unique' traits of those who provide manu al therapy. We acknowledge that these effects may play some role i n manual treatment methods. Why it is important to do this review Since our 2010 publication ( Gross 2010 ), numerous systematic re- views on similar topics have been published ( Boyles 2011 ;Chaibi 2012 ;Cross ;Walser 2009 ). High-quality con- clusions to effectiveness or superiority of manip ulation or mobilisation over other treatment modalities have NOT be en reported. Most evidence pertaining to subacute or chronic neck pain is of moderate to very low quality ( Cross 2011 ;Furlan 2012 ; Gross 2010 ), and almost no evidence is available on manipulation or mobilisation as a single stand-alone therapy for both acute neck disorders ( Shaw 2010 ) or radiculopathy ( Boyles 2011 ;Thoomes 2013 An update of this Cochrane systematic review is justied to strengthen our condence in the evidence.

M E T H O D S Criteria for considering studies for this review T ypes of studies We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs (QRCTs)in full-text or abstract form. A QRCT uses methods of allocation that are subject to bias in assignment, such as odd-even numbers, days of the week or patie nt record or social security number. We applied no restrictions to t he methodological quality of RCTs. 7 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.T ypes of participants Participants were adults ( 18 years) with the following. Neck pain without radicular ndings, including neck pain without specic cause, whiplash-associated disorder (WAD) category I and II ( Guzman 2008 ;Spitzer 1987 ;Spitzer 1995 ), myofascial pain syndrome and neck pain associated with degenerative changes ( Schumacher 1993 ). Cervicogenic headache ( Olesen 1988 with radicular ndings ( Schumacher 1993 ), including degenerative joint or disc disease with spinal ste nosis, spondylolisthesis or discogenic radiculopathy; WAD category III (Spitzer 1987 ;Spitzer 1995 ). We dened symptom duration as acute (< 30 days), subacute (30 days to 90 days) or chronic (> 90 days). We excluded studies if they investigated neck disorders with t he following specic causes. Denite or possible long tract signs (e.g. myelopathies). Neck pain caused by other pathological entities (Schumacher 1993 ). Headache not of cervical origin but associated with the neck. Co-existing headache when neck pain was not dominant, or when the headache was not provoked by neck movements or sustained neck postures. 'Mixed' headache, which includes more than one headache classication. T ypes of interventions We included studies using manipulation or mobilisation tech- niques. Although typically applied to the cervical region, the y could be applied to other body regions; the guiding principle w as to include a mobilisation or manipulation intervention prov ided with the intention to treat neck pain. Manipulation involves a lo- calised force of high velocity and low amplitude directed at spe- cic spinal segments. Mobilisations use low-grade/velocity, small- or large-amplitude passive movement techniques or neuromuscu - lar techniques within the patient's range of motion and withi n the patient's control. In the included studies, investigator s might use these techniques alone or in conjunction with other treatme nt agents, for example, mobilisation plus ultrasound versus u ltra- sound. All studies consisted of comparison with an inactive con- trol or with another active treatment as follows. Inactive control Placebo, for example, sham/mock mobilisation or other sham treatment (e.g. sham TENS). Adjunct treatment, for example, mobilisation plus a treatment (e.g. ultrasound) versus the same treatment (e.g. ultrasound).Wait list or no treatment. Active treatment for comparison Manipulation or mobilisation versus another intervention (e.g. manipulation versus exercise). One technique of manipulation or mobilisation versus another (e.g. rotatory break versus lateral break manipulat ion). One dose of manipulation or mobilisation versus another dose (e.g. 3 weeks at 9 sessions manipulation versus 4 weeks at 12 sessions). T ypes of outcome measures Primary outcomes Primary outcomes of interest included the following. Pain relief. Disability including, but not limited to, self report disability measures such as the Neck Disability Index (NDI), activities of daily living, return to work, sick leave and funct ion. Secondary outcomes Secondary outcomes included the following. Global perceived effect. Patient satisfaction. Quality of life. We set no restrictions on the types of tools used to measure the se outcomes, as no universally accepted tools are available, alth ough we found that investigators in several studies did use valid ated tools. Function and disability could be measured using self re port measures or observer-based physical performance tests ( Beattie 2001 ;Finch 2002 ). Measures of physical performance require test- ing the individual's ability to execute a simple activity in a s tan- dardised environment using a standardised test and scoring p roce- dure; these measures are concerned with testing a co-ordinated s et of functions needed for purposeful activity (i.e. reaching, wal king, driving). Although moderate correlation between self report scales and physical performance tests can be found in the low back liter- ature, it remains unclear whether one is superior to the other (Lee 2001 ), and in the neck literature, this relationship remains unclea r. We excluded tests used during a standard physical examination , such as inspection, range of motion, strength, palpation, pro voca- tion, muscular stability, neurological tests and cervical prop riocep- tion. We extracted data on adverse effects and costs of treatmen t. The duration of follow-up was dened as follows. Immediately post treatment (within one day). Short-term follow-up (closest to four weeks; one day to four weeks). 8 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.

SeeAppendix 1 for the search strategies used for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, MANTIS and ICL. We performed a search update in June 2015. Those results have been added to 'Studies awaiting classication' and will be inco r- porated into the review at the next update. Searching other resources We also screened references, personally communicated with iden - tied content experts and checked our own personal les to iden- tify potential references up to November 2014. Data collection and analysis Selection of studies At least two review authors with expertise in medicine, physi other- apy, chiropractic, massage therapy, statistics or clinical epide mi- ology independently conducted selection at two stages - citatio nidentication (citation posting plus abstract) followed by stu dy se- lection (full text) - using pre-piloted forms. The assembled gr oup did not author any of the primary trials. We assessed agreeme nt on study selection using the quadratic weighted Kappa statisti c (Kw) and Cicchetti weights ( Cicchetti 1976 ). We consulted a third re- view author in cases of persisting disagreement. Data extraction and management T wo review authors independently extracted data on pre-pilot ed forms, as per all Cervical Overview Group reviews. We resolve d disagreements through consensus. We consulted a neutral thir d party if consensus was not reached. We contacted study authors to ask for missing information and to clarify data. We used descri p- tive statistics to provide a summarised description of groups , inter- ventions, outcomes, adverse effects of treatment and costs of ca re. We extracted data on design (RCT , number analysed/number (disorder subtype, duration of disorder), interven tions (treatment characteristics in treatment and comparison groups, dosage/treatment parameters, co-interventions, treatment sched- ules, durations of follow-up) and outcomes (baseline means, en d of study means, absolute benets, reported results, point e stimates with 95% condence intervals (CIs), side effects, costs of care and adverse events). We noted these factors in the Characteristics of included studies table. All results reported were based on the sam- ple size analysed using the 'intention-to-treat' principle, i n other words, the sample entering the study. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies At least two review authors independently assessed risk of b ias (Appendix 2 ;Furlan 2009 ;Higgins 2011 ) using pre-piloted forms. We resolved disagreements through consensus ( Graham 2012 ). The Cervical Overview Group used a calibrated team of assessor s, and at least two assessors independently assessed the follo wing characteristics for risk of bias (maximum criteria = 12; low risk o f bias = six or more criteria were met versus high risk of bias = v e or fewer criteria were met): randomisation; concealment of treatm ent allocation; blinding of participant, provider and outcome ass essor; incomplete data: withdrawal/dropout rate and intention-to-t reat analysis; selective reporting; and other: similar ba seline values, similar co-interventions, acceptable compliance and sim ilar timing of assessment. We did not exclude studies from further analyses on the basis of results of risk of bias assessments. Measures of treatment effect For continuous data, we calculated standardised mean differen ces with 95% condence intervals (SMDs; 95% CIs). Standard mean difference was selected over mean difference (MD) because dif- ferent types of exercises were assessed, and most interventi ons 9 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.used different outcome measures and different scales. Mean di f- ference was used for trials reporting the same outcome measure . The Cochrane Back Review Group guidelines ( Furlan 2009 ) were foundational to key estimations of minimum clinically import ant differences for pain and function/disability. We assumed tha t the minimum clinically important difference was 10 on a 100-point pain intensity scale ( Cleland 2008 ;Farrar 2001 ;Felson 1995 ; Goldsmith 1993 ). Similarly, we judged a minimum clinically im- portant difference of 5/50 units, or 10%, to be relevant for th e NDI ( Stratford 1999 ); a recent systematic review ( MacDermid 2009 ) reported that the minimal detectable change varied from 5/50 for non-complicated neck pain to 10/50 for cervical radicu- lopathy. The clinically important difference varied from 5/50 to 19/50 and was noted to be inconsistent across studies ( Cleland 2008 ;MacDermid 2009 ). For other outcomes (i.e. global per- ceived effect and quality of life scales) for which clear guidelin es on the size of clinically important effect sizes were lacking, we ap plied a system commonly used by Cohen 1988 : small (0.20), medium (0.50) or large (0.80). For continuous outcomes reported as medians, we calculated effe ct sizes ( Kendal 1963 , page 237). For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs). A risk ratio less than one represented benecial treatment. When nei ther continuous nor dichotomous data were available, we extracted ndings and statistical signicance as reported by the author(s ) of the original study and noted them in the Characteristics of included studies table. We calculated the number needed to treat for an additional bene - cial outcome (NNTB: the number of patients a clinician needs to treat to achieve clinically important improvement in one patie nt) and treatment advantages (%: clinically important differences or changes in percentage) for primary ndings, to give the reader a sense of the magnitude of the treatment effect ( Gross 2002a ; see Table 1 andTable 2 for operational denition, calculations and results). Dealing with missing data We contacted the primary authors to request missing outcomes. T o facilitate analysis, we used data imputation rules when neces sary (Appendix 3 ). Assessment of heterogeneity Before calculating a pooled effect measure using RevMan 2014 , we assessed the reasonableness of pooling on clinical grounds ( Verbeek 2012 ). Possible sources of heterogeneity considered were symptom duration (acute versus chronic); subtype of neck pain (e.g. WAD); intervention type (e.g. mobilisation versus manipulation); charac- teristics of treatment (e.g. dosage, technique); and outcomes (pa in relief, measures of function and disability, participant sat isfaction, quality of life). We tested statistical heterogeneity betwee n studiesby using a random-effects model. In the absence of heterogeneit y (P value > 0.1 and I\u00b2 > 40%), we combined data across studies as pooled SMDs, MDs or RRs using methods available in RevMan 2014 . Assessment of reporting biases We used a funnel plot to detect reporting bias. Data synthesis We combined data across studies as pooled SMDs, MDs or RRs using methods available in RevMan 2014 after we assessed het- erogeneity. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence us ing theGrading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach of The Cochrane Collaboration (Guyatt 2010 ;Higgins 2011 ;Appendix 4 ). Domains that may de- crease the quality of the evidence include study design, limita tions - risk of bias, consistency of results, directness (generalisab ility), precision (sufcient data) and reporting biases. We dened hig h- quality evidence as reported by RCTs with low risk of bias that provided consistent, direct and precise results for the outcome . We reduced the quality of the evidence by one level for each domain not met.. High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our condence in the estimate of effect. Consistent ndings among 75% of RCTs with low risk of bias are generalisable to the population in question. Sufcient data, with narrow condence intervals, are available. No reporting biases are k nown or suspected. (All domains are met.) Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our condence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. (One domain is not met.) Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our condence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. (T wo domains are not met.) Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate. (Three domains are not met.) No evidence: We identied no RCTs that measured the outcome. We considered various factors to place the results into a larger clinical context: temporality, plausibility, strength of ass ociation, dose response, adverse events and costs. Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity Although we planned to perform subgroup analyses to assess t he influence of three factors: risk of bias (concealment of alloca- tion, blinding of outcome assessor), duration (acute, subacute, chronic) and subtypes of the disorder degenerative change-related, radicular ndings, cer vico- genic headache), we found that this was not possible. We denote d 10 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.subgroups to descriptively explore the effects of treatment d osage for manipulation alone or mobilisation alone, as meta-regre ssion was not possible. We consistently denoted trial risk of bias, quality of the evidence and duration of the disorder. Sensitivity analysis We did not perform sensitivity analyses on other factors (i.e. char- acteristics of the intervention examined, the intervention co m- pared and the outcome (time point); arising analysis factors) no r meta-regression because data in any one category of mobilisati on or manipulation were insufcient. However, we did present da ta according to body region of manipulation or mobilisation. R E S U L T S Description of studies This update included 26 new trials for manipulation or mobili sa- tion versus inactive control or another active treatment ( Aquino 2009 ;Bronfort 2012 ;Cheung Lau 2011 ;Escortell-Mayor 2011 ; Fernandez 2009 ;Gemmell 2010 ;Gonzalez-Iglesias 2009 JO ;Gonzalez-Iglesias 2009 MT ;von Piekartz 2011 ;Youssef 2013 ;Yurkiw 1996 ). Results of the search Figure 1 describes the flow of studies from our previous updates (1822 citation postings) and from this update (1011 + 1004 + 280 citation postings). From 168 references representing 126 RCTs , we selected 51 RCTs (2910/3294 participants analysed/randoml y assigned), and four are pending from our most recent update. Manipulation/Mobilisation versus control represented 18 p ub- lications for manipulation or mobilisation performed as a si n- gle-modal application; manipulation/mobilisation versus a nother treatment represented 34 publications for manipulation or m o- bilisation performed as a single-modal application and one pu bli- cation that compared manipulation/mobilisation versus an in ac- tive control and another active treatment ( Saayman 2011 ); data on multi-modal approaches that included manual therapy were obtained from this report and were presented separately ( D'Sylva 2010 ;Miller 2010 ). 11 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Included studies SeeCharacteristics of included studies . For comparison with various inactive control trials, the following disorder categories emerged. 18 studies included individuals with neck pain without radicular ndings: acute ( Fernandez 2009 ;Gonzalez-Iglesias 2009 JO ;Gonzalez-Iglesias 2009 MT ); chronic ( Bitterli 1977 ; Cheung Lau 2011 ;Cleland 2005 ;Lin 2013 ;Martel 2011 ; Saavedra-Hernandez 2012CR ); 2004 ; 2006a ;Masaracchio 2013 ; Saayman 2011 ;Sloop 1982 ;Sterling 2010 ); and symptom duration not reported ( Krauss 2008 ;Parkin-Smith 1998 ). 13 studies investigated neck pain: acute ( Fernandez 2009 ; Gonzalez-Iglesias 2009 JO ;Gonzalez-Iglesias 2009 MT ); chronic ( Cheung Lau 2011 ;Cleland 2005 ;Lin Martinez-Segura2006a ;Masaracchio 2013 2011 and symptom duration not reported ( Krauss 2008 ;Parkin-Smith 1998 ).

One investigated neck disorders with radicular signs and symptoms: mixed ( Howe 1983 ). For comparison with active treatment trials, the following disorder categories emerged. 34 studies included a comparison group (see Figure 2 ) (Aquino 2009 ;Bronfort 2012 ;Cassidy 1992 ;Chen 2007 ;Gemmell 2010 1999 Yurkiw 1996 ). 13 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.

One investigated cervicogenic headache with or without radicular symptoms: mixed ( Hurwitz 2002 ). One investigated temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction ( von Piekartz 2011 ). Ongoing studies We recognised in this review a total of 13 ongoing studies from 1995 through 2015. With nine of 13 protocols/pilot studies pu b- lished in 2010 or before, we could not rule out publication bias . SeeCharacteristics of ongoing studies . Studies awaiting classication ForMoretti 2004 andCleland 2007 , we are awaiting additional data; therefore classication is pending (see Characteristics of studies awaiting classication ). For Leonelli 2013 , we are await- ing a translation. We retrieved four studies in our most re- cent (June 2015) update, and they are pending data extraction (Casanova-Mendez 2014 ;El Soleny 2014 ;Izquierdo-Perez 2014 ; Karas 2014 ). Excluded studiesWe excluded 107 RCTs using the PICO (population, intervention , comparison and outcome) format. We excluded 18 trials on the basis of population (i.e. spasmodic torticollis, unable to sp lit data from combined neck and low back trials, normal cervical spine); 68 for interventions (i.e. manual therapy in both treatment a nd control groups); 10 for design (i.e. mechanistic or multi-modal trial design); and 11 for outcomes (i.e. range of motion data onl y).. SeeCharacteristics of excluded studies . Risk of bias in included studies Risk of bias of included manipulation/mobilisation versus inactive controls A total of 18 studies included a control (see Figure 2 ) (Bitterli 1977 ;Cheung Lau 2011 ;Cleland 2005 ;Fernandez 2004 JWRD ; Fernandez 2009 ;Gonzalez-Iglesias 2009 JO ;Gonzalez-Iglesias 2009 MT ;Howe 1983 ;Sloop 1982 ; Sterling 2010 ). Researchers failed to describe or use appropriate concealment of allocation (39%, 7/18). Study lacked effective 100%, 18/18; personnel/car We acknowledge that it is difcult to blind participants and impossible to blind care providers whe n manual treatments are provided. Selective outcome reporting bias was seen in 5% (1/18). The Cervical Overview Group has found that very few investigators register their studies with the research data base. Co-intervention was avoided in a small number of studies (28%, 5/18), and compliance was monitored in 44% (8/18). Risk of bias of included manipulation/mobilisation versus active comparisons A total of 34 studies included a comparison group (see Figure 2) (Aquino 2009 ;Bronfort 2012 ;Cassidy 1992 ;Chen 2007 ; Coppieters 2003 teen studies (13/34, 38%) had low risk of bias and 21 (21/34, 62%) had high risk of bias. 15 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Researchers failed to adequately describe or use an appropriate randomisation technique in 13 studies (38%, 13/ 34). Study authors failed to adequately describe or use appropriate concealment of allocation in 22 studies (65%, 22/ 34). Effective blinding procedures were lacking in 31 studies regarding the participant (91%, 31/34), in 34 studies regardin g the care provider (100%, 34/34) and in 31 studies regarding the outcome assessor (91%, 31/34). We acknowledge that it is difcult to blind the participant and impossible to blind the ca re provider when manual treatments are provided. Investigators described acceptable dropout rates in 23 studies (68%, 23/34). All randomly assigned participants were reported/analysed in the group to which they were allocated by randomisation in18 studies (53%, 18/34). Information regarding reporting bias was lacking in 33 studies (97%, 33/34). Groups were similar at baseline regarding the most important prognostic indicators in 20 studies (59%, 20/34). Co-intervention was avoided or similar between participants in 10 studies (29%, 10/34). Researchers monitored acceptable compliance in 14 studies (41%, 14/34). Timing of the outcome assessment was similar in all groups in 30 studies (88%, 30/34). Other potential sources of bias Funnel plot analysis suggests the presence of publication bia s ( Figure 3 ).

High-quality evidence provides greatest certaint y about the effectiveness of treatment. Manipulation alone of cervical region In all, 24 trials met the inclusion criteria for this section. T w elve of them had low risk of bias ( Bronfort 2012 ;Cassidy 1992 ; Haas 2004 ;Haas ;Leaver ;Saayman 2011 2008 ;Wood 2001 ; Yurkiw 1996 ), and 12 had high risk of bias ( Bitterli 1977 ;Chen We reported the following observations: (1) results from a sing le ses- sion, which may not depict clinical practice but nevertheless were assessed in clinical trials; and (2) ndings of trials using mul tiple treatment sessions, dose responses and comparison trials. Manipulation alone of cervical region versus inactive contro l Pain Single session Three very small RCTs, one at high risk of bias and two at low risk, assessed the effect of a single session of manipulation (see Figure 2 ): One mock treatment indicated that a single session of manipulation resulted in immediate pain relief (very low qua l- ity, number needed to treat for an additional benecial outcom e 2, 71 participants; neck dis- orders of mixed duration; two trials showed that a single ses sion of manipulation as adjunct treatment to certain medications offe red no short-term benet for pain relief in chronic neck disorders w ith radicular ndings or headache (very low quality, 29 participant s;Howe 1983 ), nor in subacute and chronic neck disorders with as- sociated cervical spondylosis (low quality, 39 participants; Sloop 1982 ). Multiple sessions T wo very small RCTs, one at high and one at low risk of bias, assessed the effects of multiple sessions of manipulation ve rsus a control and provided conflicting evidence. T wo trials (low qualit y, 60 participants; Bitterli 1977 ;Saayman 2011 ) that assessed people with subacute and chronic neck pain yielded conflicting results. These results could not be combined because they consisted of dif - ferent types of data. Six sessions of manipulation over thre e weeks when added to laser showed pain reduction at short-term follow - up (low quality, 40 participants; Saayman 2011 ). Four sessions over three weeks when compared with an inactive control reveale d no evidence of benet for pain reduction at short-term follow-up (low quality, 20 participants; Bitterli 1977 ). Manipulation alone of cervical region versus oral medication Three trials compared cervical manipulation versus use of oral medication. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, opioids and muscle relaxants (moderate 181 with acute and subacute neck pain; Bronfort 2012 ). T enoxicam with ranitidine (very low quality, 35 participants with chronic neck pain; Giles 1999 ). Celaconxin, rofecoxib or paracetamol (very low quality, 42 participants chronic neck pain; Muller 2005 ). SeeSummary of ndings for the main comparison for main results representing evidence of moderate quality. Pain For acute/subacute neck pain, manipulation was more effective than use of certain oral medications [non-steroidal anti-inflamm a- tory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, opioids and muscle relax- ants] at immediate post (moderate quality, 182 par pants, SMD -0.34, 95% CI at long-term follow-up (moderate quality, 181 participants, SMD - 0.32, 95% CI -0.61 to (see Figure 4 ). Cer- vical manipulation was found to be no more effective than cer- tain medications at intermediate-term follow-up (moderate qua l- CI -0.5 to 0.08; Bronfort 2012 ).

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Figure 4. Forest plot of comparison: manipulation vs anothe r treatment, outcome: PAIN: cervical manipulation vs medicine. For chronic neck pain, manipulation was no different from use of certain medications (see above, per author) at immediate pos t treatment (very low quality, 35 participants; Giles 1999 ) and at long-term follow-up (very low quality, 42 participants; Muller 2005 ). Function and disability For acute/subacute neck pain, manipulation showed a slight ad- vantage over oral medication (see above) immediate post treat - ment and at intermediate-term follow-up (SMD -0.30, 95% CI - 0.59 to not over the long term (SMD -0.11, 95% CI - 0.40 to 0.18, moderate quality, 182 participants; Bronfort 2012 ). For chronic neck pain, investigators reported no differences b e- tween manipulation and oral medication (see above) at immedi- ate post treatment (very low quality, 30 participants; Giles 1999 ) and over the long term (very low quality, 42 participants; Muller 2005 ). Global perceived effect Bronfort 2012 (moderate quality, 182 participants) suggested that 12 weeks of manipulation was superior to use of oral medicatio n (see above) for global perceived effect at long-term follow-up of participants with acute/subacute neck pain. Patient satiscation Bronfort 2012 (moderate quality, 182 participants) suggested that12 weeks of manipulation was superior to use of oral medicatio n (see above) for satisfaction at long-term follow-up among parti ci- pants with acute/subacute neck pain. Quality of life Bronfort 2012 (moderate quality, 182 participants) found no sig- nicant results for oral medication (see above) at immediate-, i n- termediate- and long-term follow-up. Manipulation alone of cervical region versus mobilisation and other manual techniques Pain Single session T wo trials assessed the effects of a single session of cervical m anip- ulation versus varied comparisons. A single session of manipulation (low quality, 100 participants; Cassidy 1992 ) was comparable with a neuromuscular mobilisation approach using muscle energy technique for immediate pain relief in neck disorders of mixed duration. 18 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.A single session of manipulation (low quality, 28 participants; Yurkiw 1996 ) showed no signicant differences in pain relief when compared with a single session of activator instrument. None of the above trials showed differences between groups fo r pain relief at immediate term among individuals with subacut e or chronic neck disorders. Multiple sessions T en trials assessed the effects of four to 20 sessions of manip ulation conducted over two to 12 weeks against: mobilisations (36 participants, Gemmell 2010 ; 269 participants, Hurwitz 2002 ; 177 participants, Leaver 2010 ); massage - soft tissue treatments (32 participants, Haas 2010 ; 53 participants, Nilsson 1997 ); manipulation of the thoracic spine alone (20 participants, Puentedura 2011 ); combined therapeutic approach including muscle energy provided to the thoracic spine and sacroiliac joint (six participants, Strunk 2008 ); manipulation of varied dosages (15 participants, Haas 2004 ; 32 participants, Haas 2010 ); manipulation of varied techniques (30 participants, van Schalkwyk 2000 );mobilisation plus heat; mobilisation plus electronic muscle stimulation (EMS); mobilisation plus heat and EMS (269 participants, Hurwitz 2002 ); and activator instrument (36 participants, Gemmell 2010 ; 30 participants, Wood 2001 ). Manipulation was no more effective than mobilisation in impr ing MD pooled -0.07, 95% CI -0.72 to 0.59; Hurwitz 2002 ;Leaver (see Figure 5 ;Summary of ndings 3 ). One trial (of very low quality) assessed the effects of six session s of manipulation conducted over three weeks compared with six ses- sions of mobilisation ( Gemmell 2010 ). Despite lack of data, none of these studies showed signicant differences between group s for pain relief at immediate-, short-, intermediate- and long -term (Gemmell 2010 ) follow-up for those with subacute and chronic neck pain. Both Haas 2010 andNilsson 1997 have concluded that manual therapy was more effective than \"light manual the r- apy\" (massage) at short term (low quality, 85 participants, SMD pooled -0.5, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.70) follow-up. These ndings are supported by Haas 2010 at intermediate-term (low quality, 72 participants, SMD -0.79, 95% CI -1.47 to -0.11) follow-up. A clinician would have to treat ve people (NNTB 5) to achieve this intermediate-term result in one person. Figure 5.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Puentedura 2011 (very low quality, 20 participants) demonstrated that cervical manipulation was more effective than thoracic ma- nipulation at short- (SMD NNTB 6) follow-up. Cervical manipulation contrasted against a combined therapeutic approach of thoracic and sacroiliac manip - ulation (one trial, 2008 ) yielded similar ndings for subacute/chronic neck pain at immediate post treat - ment. Haas 2004 andHaas 2010 reported no signicant results re- garding the utilisation of 12 sessions of manipulation vers us three sessions at short- (low quality, 47 participants, SMD pooled -0 .66, 95% CI -1.81 to 0.49) and intermediate-term (moderate quality, 50 SMD pooled -0.40, 95% CI -0.96 to 0.16) follow- up for chronic neck pain with CGH (see Summary of ndings 5 ). Three trials compared one manipulation technique versus anot her and found no difference in immediate- and short-term pain reli ef when a rotary break manipulation was compared with a lateral break manipulation for 10 sessions over four weeks in partici pants with neck disorder of undened duration (very low quality; van Schalkwyk 2000 ); and when manual manipulation was compared with instrumental manipulation (activator) for subacute neck d is- order after eight sessions over four weeks (very low quality; Wood 2001 ) and after six sessions over three weeks (very low quality; Gemmell 2010 ). Function and disability Manipulation was no more effective than mobilisation at shor t- participants; Hurwitz 2002 ; Leaver 2010 ; SMD pooled 0.10, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.37). One additional trial (very low quality, 31 participants; Gemmell 2010 ) assessed the effects of six sessions of manipulation conducted over three weeks compared with six sessions of mobilisation.

One trial assessed the effects of six sessions of manipulation conducted over three weeks compared with six sessions of application of the activator instrument (v ery low quality, 27 participants; Gemmell 2010 ); no signicant dif- ferences between groups were noted in functional improvement at immediate-, short-, intermediate- and long-term follow-up f or those with subacute and chronic neck pain. Global perceived effect One trial assessed the effects of four sessions of manipulati on con- ducted over two weeks compared with four sessions of mobilisa- tion (moderate quality, 177 participants; Leaver 2010 ) in individ- uals with subacute to chronic neck pain. Results showed no diffe r- ences between groups at immediate- 95% CI -0.35 to 0.24) follow-up for global perceived effect. Gemmell 2010 (very low quality, 36 participants) compared the effectiveness of ma - nipulation, mobilisation and the activator instrument. Thi s study showed no signicant differences between treatment groups at im- mediate-, short-, intermediate- and long-term follow-up in glo bal perceived effect for those with subacute neck pain. Patient satiscation One trial (moderate quality, 269 participants; Hurwitz 2002 ) as- sessed the effect of 12 sessions of manipulation conducted over six weeks compared with mobilisation (SMD -0.02, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.24). Findings showed no differences in short-term participan t satisfaction among those with subacute and chronic neck pain. Quality of life One trial (moderate quality, 176 participants; Leaver 2010 ) showed no signicant differences in quality of life between ma nip- ulation mobilisation to 0.24) and long-term follow-up for participants with subacute an d chronic neck pain. Gemmell 2010 (very low quality, 28 partici- pants) compared the effects of six sessions of manipulation ve r- sus application of the activator instrument conducted over thre e weeks.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Single session One trial assessed the effects of a single session of cervical ma nip- ulation compared with a single use of kinesio-tape (very low qua l- ity, 76 participants; Saavedra-Hern\u00e1ndez 2012JO ) and showed no signicant differences in relief at immediate-term follo w-up for individuals with subacute or chronic neck disorders. Multiple sessions Five trials assessed the effects of manipulation conducted ove r two to 12 weeks against: exercise (moderate quality, 182 participants; Bronfort 2012 ); low-level laser therapy (low quality, 40 participants; Saayman 2011 ); TENS (very low quality, 70 participants; Chen 2007 ); acupuncture (very low quality, 43 participants; Muller 2005 ); and low-voltage electrical acupuncture (very low quality, 38 participants; Giles 1999 ). Cervical manipulation was found to be no more effective than exercise (moderate quality, 216 participants; Bronfort 2012 ) CI -0.23 to 0.35) follow-up. See Summary of ndings 4 . One trial (low quality, 40 participants; Saayman 2011 ) assessed the ef- fects of six sessions of manipulation conducted over three week s compared with six sessions of low-level laser therapy at short -term follow-up for those with subacute and chronic neck pain; results favoured manipulation plus low-level laser therapy and show ed no differences between manipulation and low-level laser ther apy alone. Chen 2007 (very low quality, 70 participants) demonstrated that manipulation was more effective than TENS for individua ls with chronic CGH at short-term (SMD -1.92, 95% CI -2.49 to - 1.35) follow-up. Manipulation was found to be no different fr om low-voltage electrical acupuncture (very low quality, 38 partici- pants; Giles 1999 ) immediately post treatment or from acupunc- ture (very low quality ,one trial, 43 participants; Muller 2005 ) in terms of pain relief at long-term follow-up. Function and disability Single session One trial (very low quality, 76 participants; Saavedra-Hern\u00e1ndez 2012JO ) demonstrated that use of kinesio-tape for seven days was more effective than performance of two manipulation tech- niques to improve function immediately after treatment (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.92). This difference did not reach the clinically important difference.Multiple sessions Manipulation was no more effective than exercise (moderate qua l- ity, 182 participants; Bronfort 2012 95% CI -0.31 to 0.27) follow-up. Other studies reported no signicant differences b e- tween groups at any follow-up time point as follows. No differ ence in function was noted between low-voltage electrical acupunc- ture (very low quality, 38 participants; Giles 1999 ) immediately post treatment and acupuncture (very low quality, 43 participan ts; Muller 2005 ) at long-term follow-up. One trial (very low quality, 76 participants; Saayman 2011 ) assessed the effects of six sessions of manipulation conducted over three weeks versus six session s of low-level laser therapy at short-term follow-up and showed a signicant difference favouring the combination of cervical ma- nipulation plus low-level laser therapy. Global perceived effect Despite the lack of data for statistical analysis, one trial (mo derate quality, 182 participants; Bronfort 2012 ) showed no differences for this outcome between 12 weeks of manipulation and applica- tion of a home exercise programme at long-term follow-up. Participant satiscation Bronfort 2012 (moderate quality, 182 participants) suggested that 12 weeks of cervical manipulation was superior to application o f a home exercise programme for participant satisfaction at long - term follow-up in participants with acute or subacute neck pain. Quality of life One trial (moderate quality, 182 participants; Bronfort 2012 ) showed no differences (SMD 0.0, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.29) between cervical manipulation and a home exercise programme at inter- mediate- and long-term follow-up. Manipulation alone of thoracic region T welve trials looked at manipulation alone in the thoracic re gion. Manipulation alone of thoracic region versus inactive contr ol T en trials (six low risk of bias, four high risk of bias) assess ed ma- nipulation alone versus an inactive control in the thoracic reg ion. SeeSummary of ndings 2 . Pain Single session 21 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Three RCTs - two with low and one with high risk of bias - assess ed the effects of a single session of manipulation. They were clin ically heterogeneous owing to disorder type and comparison (see Figure 2). One trial found that manipulation decreased pain when com- pared with placebo in participants with chronic neck pain (low quality, 36 participants; Cleland 2005 ). T wo trials showed no dif- ferences between groups for manipulation when compared with an inactive control (very low, 22 participants; Krauss 2008 ) and when compared with same treatment in both arms (low quality, 82 participants; Saavedra-Hernandez 2012CR ). Multiple sessions Seven RCTs - four with low and three with high risk of bias - assessed the effects of thoracic manipulation provided at mul tiple sessions at three different follow-up points (see Figure 2 ). Immediate follow-up: T wo trials (low quality, 90 participants, pooled SMD -3.46, 95% CI -4.13 to -2.79; Fernandez 2009 ;Gonzalez-Iglesias 2009 JO ) looked at effects on acute pain and found that results favoured the treatment grou p. T wo trials (low quality, 141 participants, pooled SMD -0.23, 95% CI -1.15 to 0.69; Cheung Lau 2011 ;Parkin-Smith 1998 ) looked at chronic pain, and the results were heterogeneous (I2= 81%). Short-term follow-up: Four trials (moderate quality, 242 JWRD ;Gonzalez-Iglesias 2009 JO;Gonzalez-Iglesias 2009 MT ;Masaracchio 2013 ) that looked at acute and subacute neck pain, although assessed to be clinically similar, were statistically heterogeneous (I2= 84%). Pooled results favoured the experimental group (SMD -1.46, - 2.20 to -0.71; NNTB 4 to 7; magnitude of effect: small to medium). For chronic neck pain, one trial (111 participants; Cheung Lau 2011 ) looked at multiple sessions of thoracic manipulation compared with the same treatment in both arms. Results showed a decrease in pain in the experimental group. Intermediate follow-up: One trial (low quality, 111 participants; Cheung Lau 2011 ) favoured the experimental group when compared with the same treatment in both arms. Function and disability Six trials investigated the effects of thoracic manipulation when compared with a control. Single session One RCT with low risk of bias assessed the effects of single-ses sion thoracic manipulation (see Figure 2 ). This trial quality, 82 participants; Saavedra-Hernandez 2012CR ) found that thoracic manipulation signicantly favoured the experimental group when function was assessed among participants with chronic neck pain .Multiple sessions Four RCTs assessed the effects of multiple sessions of thoraci c manipulation at three follow-up periods (see Figure 2 ). Immediate follow-up: T wo trials (low quality, 141 participants, pooled SMD -0.52, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.18; Cheung Lau 2011 ) looked effects on function/disability and signicantly favoured the experime ntal group for chronic neck pain. Short-term follow-up: Four trials (moderate quality, 258 participants; NNTB 5, Cheung Lau 2011 ; NNTB 5, Gonzalez-Iglesias 2009 JO ; NNTB 5, Gonzalez-Iglesias 2009 MT; NNTB 4, Masaracchio 2013 ) looked at the effects of thoracic manipulation among participants with acute, subacute and chronic neck pain. All four trials favoured or signicantly favoured the experimental group (pooled SMD -1.40, 95% CI - 2.24 to -0.55). The magnitude of effect was small to medium across varied outcome measures. Intermediate follow-up: One trial (low quality, 111 participants, NNTB 5, magnitude small; Cheung Lau 2011 ) looked at the effects of thoracic manipulation among participants with chronic neck pain and signicantly favoured the experimental group. Quality of life One trial investigated the effects of thoracic manipulation w hen compared with a control. Multiple sessions One RCT with low risk of bias assessed the effects of multiple sessions of thoracic manipulation at immediate-, short- and i nter- mediate-term follow-up (see Figure 2 ). This trial (low quality, 111 participants; Cheung Lau 2011 ) signicantly favoured the exper- imental group for chronic neck pain. Subgroup analysis Effects calculated in these meta-analyses tended to overestima te the intervention effect, as suggested by the asymmetrical appear ance of the funnel plots in Figure 3 (pain). Publication bias, a type of re- porting bias, was possible and could not be ruled out. When con- sidering disorder subtypes, all trials except one ( Fernandez 2004 JWRD ) (WAD 2 or 3) discussed neck pain. Therefore, subgroup analysis of this factor could not be formally conductied through meta-regression. Very low-quality evidence (one trial, 88 part ici- pants; Fernandez 2004 JWRD ) supported thoracic manipulation as an adjunct to individualised physiotherapy care for pain re duc- tion in acute/subacute WAD 2 or 3. 22 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Manipulation alone of thoracic region versus mobilisation Pain Single session One trial (moderate quality, 100 participants; Sillevis 2010 ) rated as having low risk of bias concluded that a single session of tho racic manipulation was comparable with thoracic mobilisation for i m- mediate pain relief among participants with chronic non-speci c neck pain. Manipulation alone of thoracic region versus mobilisation Pain Multiple sessions One trial (very low quality, 41 participants; Savolainen 2004 ) with high risk of bias concluded that four sessions of thoracic manip ula- tion over four weeks led to similar pain outcomes when compared with instructed exercise conducted over an undisclosed period fo r participants with neck pain of undened duration at long-term follow-up. Mobilisation alone of cervical region Nine trials - ve with low ( Coppieters 2003 ;David 1998 ;Hurwitz 2002 ;Kanlayanaphotporn 2009 ;Kanlayanaphotporn and with risk bias Bitterli 1977 ;Cassidy 1992 ;Egwu 2008 ;Sterling 2001 ) - met the inclusion criteria. Mobilisation alone of cervical region versus inactive contro l T wo trials looked at mobilisation alone of the cervical region versus an inactive control. Both trials had high risk of bias ( Bitterli 1977 ; Sterling 2010 ). Pain One trial (very low quality, 18 participants; Bitterli 1977 ) reported no additional pain relief when mobilisation was used as an ad junct to manipulation in participants with chronic CGH or degenera- tive changes immediately following the treatment period. In one trial (low quality, 39 participants; Sterling 2001 ), results favoured inactive control when compared with manual contact for partici- pants with subacute/chronic neck pain - WAD 2.Mobilisation alone of cervical region versus medical injecti on Pain Multiple sessions Lee 2013 (very low quality, 33 participants) concluded that mobil- isation using the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation tech- nique neck pain with myofascial pain syndrome. Function No signicant difference in function was found when this mobil- isation approach was compared with intramuscular injection in one trial (very low quality, 33 participants; Lee 2013 ). Mobilisation alone of cervical region versus mobilisation an d other manual techniques Pain Single session Three trials assessed the effect of one session of one mobilis ation technique versus another at a randomly chosen segment in parti c- ipants with chronic neck pain. Mobilisation at most symptomatic segment versus mobilisation at randomly chosen segment (low quality, 48 participants; Aquino 2009 ). Central posterior-to- anterior (PA) passive accessory movement mobilisation technique versus random PAs at the same segment (low quality, 60 participants; Kanlayanaphotporn 2010a ). Ipsilateral PAs versus random PAs at the same segment (low quality, 60 participants; Kanlayanaphotporn 2009 ). Mobilisation perpendicular to the facet plane at the most symptomatic segment versus the same mobilisation three lev els above or below (low quality, 126 participants; Schomacher 2009 ). None of these studies demonstrated signicant differences be - tween groups for reducing neck pain. T wo studies compared the effectiveness of one mobilisation technique versus anoth er mobilisation technique in individuals with chronic neck pain (Kanlayanaphotporn 2009 ;Kanlayanaphotporn 2010a ). One study showed no signicant differences in pain reduction when an ipsilateral PA mobilisation was compared with one of three randomly selected mobilisation techniques: ipsilateral PA, central 23 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.PA or contralateral PA ( Kanlayanaphotporn 2009 ). Another study by the same authors demonstrated no signicant change in pain when comparing central PA mobilisation versus one of the three random mobilisation techniques ( Kanlayanaphotporn 2010a ). Al- though statistically not signicant, the mean achieved a minim al clinically important change, and post hoc analysis using an int er- action plot favoured PA mobilisations over random mobilisat ion for neck pain during movement. Multiple sessions Seven trials assessed the effects of one mobilisation techniq ue against another manual therapy technique. These studies rep orted the following varied results. Massage - light manual therapy (very low quality, 22 participants; Madson 2010 ; 36 participants, Youssef 2013 ): Youssef 2013 concluded that mobilisation was more effective than a massage regimen consisting of six phases at immediate follow-up (SMD -2.89, 95% CI -3.85 to -1.93) for 2010 noted no difference (SMD -0.52, 95% CI -1.35 to 0.32) when using effleurage, stroking and p\u00e9trissa ge for chronic neck pain. One technique versus another - anterior-to- posterior (AP) accessory movements, PA transverse and cervical rotational oscillatory techniques (low quality, 95 participants; Egwu 2008 ): Egwu 2008 concluded that use of an AP unilateral pressure technique was more effective for pain relief immediately post treatment when compared with rotation or transverse pressur e (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.72) after multiple sessions of mobilisation given twice a week for a maximum of four weeks. Activator instrument (very low quality, 28 participants; Gemmell 2010 ): One trial (31 participants; Gemmell 2010 ) showed no signicant difference between mobilisation and the Activator instrument for pain relief at immediate-, short-, intermediate- and long-term follow-up among those with subacute neck pain. Manual therapy to the TMJ (very low quality, 38 participants; von Piekartz 2011 ): Study authors concluded that manual therapy to the TMJ among individuals with chronic CGH with a minimum of one of the four signs of a TMJ disorder was more effective than manual therapy to the cervical spine immediately post treatment (SMD 2.27, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.10, NNTB 2) and at intermediate-term (SMD 3.55, 95% 4.61, NNTB 2) follow-up. Various multi-modal approaches: Hurwitz 2002 (moderate quality, 133 participants) compared the effectiveness of mobilisation versus manipulation as an adjunct treatment to heat, manipulation plus electrical muscular stimulation (EMS) and manipulation plus heat and EMS. This study showed no signicant differences in pain relief between treatment grou ps of participants with subacute or chronic neck pain at intermediate - term follow-up. Additionally, Cassidy 1992 (low quality, 100participants) compared manipulation versus a muscle energy technique and reported no difference in pain measures immediately following the treatment period for chronic neck pain. Function and disability Single session We found no trial. Multiple sessions The following four trials assessed the effects of mobilisati on against various manual therapy approaches; three suggested no signi cant results at any time point, and one ( von Piekartz 2011 ) favoured manual therapy to the TMJ. Manual therapy to the TMJ (very low quality, 38 participants; von Piekartz 2011 ): Investigators found that manual therapy to the TMJ was more effective than manual therapy to the cervical spine immediately post treatment (SMD 1.35, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.06, NNTB 5) CI 1.39 to 3.04, NNTB 4) follow-up. Participants in this trial had cervicogenic headache with at lea st one sign or symptom of TMJ disorder. Massage - light manual therapy (very low quality, 23 participants; Madson 2010 ; 36 participants, Youssef 2013 ). Activator instrument (very low quality, 31 participants; Gemmell 2010 ). Global perceived effect T wo small trials compared the impact of one session of one PA mobilisation technique versus a random mobilisation tech- nique on global perceived effect in individuals with chronic neck pain at immediate follow-up (low quality, 120 partici- pants; Kanlayanaphotporn 2009 ;Kanlayanaphotporn 2010a ). Re- searchers reported no signicant results for global perceived effect. Mobilisation alone of cervical region versus exercise and other physical medicine modalities Pain Single session One trial assessed the effect of one session of mobilisation a gainst pulsed ultrasound (low quality, 20 participants; Coppieters 2003 ). 24 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Researchers investigated neural dynamic mobilisation in 20 par- ticipants with acute and chronic neck pain and found a non-sig- nicant difference in pain reduction when compared with pulsed ultrasound. Although results were not statistically signi cant, the mean achieved a minimal clinically important difference (sugges t- ing possible type 2 error). Multiple sessions Five trials assessed the effects of mobilisation against: acupuncture (low quality, 51 participants; David 1998 ): no difference in pain reduction when mobilisation was compared with acupuncture for subacute or chronic neck pain including WAD at long-term follow-up; exercise (very low quality, 20 participants; Ragonese 2009 ): no signicant difference for cervical radiculopathy at immediat e- term follow-up ( Summary of ndings 4 ); TENS (very low quality, 87 participants; Escortell-Mayor 2011 ): no signicant difference for chronic neck pain. shock wave therapy (very low quality, 33 participants; Lee 2013 ): cervical neuromuscular mobilisation technique possibly favoured over extracorporeal shock wave therapy at immediate post treatment for myofascial pain in the upper trapezius; an d cervical traction (very low quality, 26 participants; Shin 2006 ): Chuna manual therapy found more effective than cervical traction immediately post treatment for a herniated cervical d isc. Function and disability None of the following trials (acupuncture: low quality, 51 par- ticipants; David 1998 ; exercise: very low quality, 20 partici- pants; Ragonese 2009 ; TENS: very low quality, 87 participants; Escortell-Mayor 2011 ; shock wave therapy: very low quality, 33 participants; Lee 2013 ) suggested signicant results at any time point. Patient satisfaction One study (very low quality, 89 participants; Escortell-Mayor 2011 ) assessed the effects of 10 sessions of mobilisation conducted over four weeks compared with utilisation of TENS at the cervica l region. Investigators showed no signicant results for util isation of TENS at intermediate-term (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.23) fol- low-up in terms of patient satisfaction among those with chroni c neck pain.Quality of life One trial compared the effects of 10 sessions of mobilisation co n- ducted over four weeks versus utilisation of TENS at the cervica l region (very low quality, 83 participants; Escortell-Mayor 2011 ). Researchers showed no differences at immediate- and intermed i- ate-term follow-up for quality of life among those with chronic neck pain. David 1998 (low quality, 51 participants) showed no signicant results when comparing mobilisation of the cervical re- gion versus acupuncture at intermediate-term (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.35) follow-up. Other considerations Adverse events When researchers looked at mobilisation and manipulation ver - sus an inactive control, they reported the number of partici- pants experiencing side effects in 9.5% (2/18) of trials. One tr ial (Cheung Lau 2011 ) reported no side effects, and another trial (Saavedra-Hernandez 2012CR ) reported benign and transient side effects, including increased neck pain (one in the control group) or increased neck fatigue (one in the intervention group). The rate of rare but serious adverse events such as strokes or seri ous neurological decits could not be established from our review data; the power to detect any serious events is too low in these RCTs, and strict RCT procedures might prevent occurrence of such serious complications. When investigators contrasted mobi l- isation and manipulation against another comparison treatm ent, they noted that 35% (12/34) of participants experienced advers e events. T en trials reported benign and transient adverse ev ents for manipulation ( Bronfort 2011 participants manip- ulation, 22% (105/469 participants) experienced adverse even ts. Four trials reported benign and transient adverse events fo r mo- bilisation ( David 1998 ;Hurwitz 2002 ;Leaver Among participants receiving mobilisation, 11% (42/390 participants) experienced adverse events. All adverse event s re- ported for manipulation or mobilisation were benign and tra n- sient and were included for both interventions: increased neck pain, soreness, headache, stiffness, dizziness, nausea, pa raesthesia, upper limb pain, fatigue, mid-lower back pain and \"unpleasant change in spinal posture\". Cost of care The 51 trials included in this review reported no direct measur es of the cost of care. 25 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Review authors found support for use of thoracic manipulation versus control for neck pain, function and qualit y of life. Results for cervical manipulation and mobilisation v ersus control were few and diverse. We could not rule out publication bias. Findings suggest that manipulation and mobilisation pro- duce similar results. Multiple cervical manipulation session s pro- vide slightly better improvement over certain medications su ch as varied combinations of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory dru gs (NSAIDs), analgesics, opioids and muscle relaxants. In lieu of s e- rious adverse event risk for manipulation and in the light of ev- idence suggesting that mobilisation and manipulation produ ce similar results, further high-quality research exploring mo bilisa- tion is needed. Overall completeness and applicability of evidence How do we as meta-analysts reconcile the various models of car e?We noted that use of unimodal approaches was not common in clin- ical practice, although they are essential elements for teasin g out which therapeutic item or combination works best. Typical con- servative care takes a more holistic clinical approach and includ es a treatment continuum ( Jovey 2002 ) - that is, physical, psycholog- ical and pharmacological - starting with treatments that are mo st available, least expensive and least invasive and that prod uce the fewest side effects. Our review authors have acknowledged the se diversities and have noted the following emerging question s.How do we know when mobilisations will be effective? This remains unclear, as only two additional trials were discovered by this search. Meta-analyses, subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses continue to be hampered by the wide spectrum of comparisons, treatment characteristics and dosages. Until the number of high-quality s tud- ies within individual subgroups of neck pain increases, we wil l not be able to provide strong conclusions about which groups ben- et most from manipulation or mobilisation. Cleland 2007 and Puentedura 2012 developed clinical prediction rules for use of tho- racic manipulation in the treatment of neck pain. Similar stud ies investigating clinical prediction rules for other mobilisati ons or manipulations in varied neck pain populations would help clin i- cians to determine when to manual therapy should be utilised. What is the ideal mobilisation or manipulation? Our review showed that one technique was frequently compared with another in hea d- to-head comparisons of single techniques or combined treatment approaches. The answer to this question remains unclear, but e v- idence suggests that anterior-posterior (AP) or posterior-ant erior (PA) mobilisations may be more effective for reducing pain than transverse or rotational mobilisations. We believe that con tinued research is needed to perform head-to-head comparisons between the most viable techniques or approaches. What is the optimal \"dosage\"? What are the optimal \"clinical param- eters\" for a given technique category? We still do not know how to answer these questions. Data on pain relief gathered to date reveal that the most commonly reported factors were frequency (total number of sessions) and duration (total number of weeks). We noted that levels of these two factors measured at various fol low- up periods were as follows: manipulation to cervical region al one: one to 18 sessions; one day to nine weeks; manipulation of tho - racic region alone: one to 15 sessions; one day to three weeks; mobilisation of cervical region alone: one to six sessions; on e day to six weeks. The ideal dosage for cervical manipulation, thor acic manipulation or cervical mobilisation for treatment of cervica l pain could not be determined when existing controlled trials w ere 31 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.evaluated. Pilot studies of mobilisation and manipulation explor- ing the minimally effective dose and the optimal dose should b e conducted before a larger trial is undertaken. These pilot stu dies would serve a purpose similar to that of the small dose-nding studies conducted as part of pharmaceutical trials used to estab - lish a minimally effective dose. One such pilot study ( Haas 2004 ) provided preliminary support for a larger trial assessing 1 2 sessions and nine sessions over three sessions of cervical manipulatio n. A systematic review of adverse events ( Carlesso 2010 ) noted that ascertainment bias may compromise the credibility of current studies. More trials are required to report on adverse event s if meta- analysis is to be useful for obtaining a summary estimate of m i- nor adverse events. T wo recent randomised trials have noted t hat transient minor side effects such as increased treatment soren ess are common ( Paanalahti 2014 ;Walker 2013 ). These studies and one systematic review support the theory that the occurrence of catastrophic events is rare ( Carlesso 2010 ). Vertebrobasilar artery stroke following manipulation is 2008 ). Nev- ertheless, craniocervical arterial dissections as of cervical manipulation occur and should be managed ( Albuquerque 2011 ; Rushton 2012 ). Conclusive evidence is lacking for a strong associ- ation between neck manipulation and stroke ( Haynes 2012 ), and smaller randomised trials are unlikely to detect rare advers e events. From surveys and review articles, the risk of a serious irreve rsible complication (e.g. stroke) of cervical manipulations has been re - ported to vary from one adverse event in 3020 to one in 1,000,0 00 manipulations ( Assendelft 1996 ;Gross 2002b ). Reporting of seri- ous adverse events continues to be required. As emerging lite rature shows that manipulation and mobilisation are valuable addi tions to patient care options, new trials are necessary to determine eco- nomic and risk advantages derived from using manipulation o r mobilisation techniques to treat neck pain. Quality of the evidence The overarching limitation noted in this review is that only ve of the 51 trials included a sample size of more than 100 participan ts. Many trials were extremely small (20 to 30 participants). The quality of evidence is strongly limited by the large number of small trials. The randomisation technique was appropriate and was adequat ely described in 65% (33/51), and allocation concealment was suf- ciently detailed and appropriate in 45% (23/51) of studies. Th ese criteria are important for minimising selection bias, so that treat- ment is applicable to the general population. Without rates o f randomisation and allocation concealment, it is unclear whethe r groups had baseline comparability, and whether study result s are applicable to the general patient population. Many biases (detection and performance biases) are inherent in trials and tend to overestimate the trial effect. A dominant b ias in the studies included in this review was lack of blinding of pa r- ticipants (45/51) and therapists (100%). Blinding is difcult toperform in randomised controlled trial examining manipula - tion or mobilisation versus control. Blinding of both partici pants and therapists minimises performance bias as the result of di f- ferences in actual treatment provided to groups and expectatio ns of treatment. Given lack of blinding of participants and thera - pists, it is important to blind outcome assessors to ensure th at no detection bias is present; however, only 12% of studies (6/5 1) blinded the assessor. This occurred in large part because many o f the assessors were actually the participants themselves as re quired by the outcome measures (Neck Disability Index (NDI), visual analogue scale (VAS), Short Form (SF)-36) used in various trials. Researchers can minimise this bias by integrating observer-ba sed outcomes, especially those pertaining to function and disabil ity. Many pain trials use self reported outcomes; this makes it har d to protect against detection bias. Similarly, if one is to conclu de that treatment effects in fact were due to the intervention, th ereby reducing performance bias, it is important to avoid co-interven - tions. Thirty-one per cent (16/51) of the included studies expli c- itly avoided co-interventions. Based on the relatively short nature of physiotherapeutic interventions, it would be crucial to av oid co-interventions that otherwise may confound study results. T im- ing of outcome assessments is one of the dominant flaws leading to overestimation of the effects of care. In 37% (19/51) of trial s, outcomes were assessed for single-session trials, resulting in over- estimation of the treatment effect size. As this review is examining manipulation or mobilisation ve rsus an inactive control or an active treatment, compliance with treat - ment must be evaluated if strong conclusions are to be provided . Of the 51 trials included in our review, compliance was monitore d and acceptable in 45% (23/51). T o ensure compliance, investiga- tors had to track how often the participant came into the clinic to receive manipulation or mobilisation, and whether the par tici- pant received any other treatment during the entire length of the study. The most common method of tracking a patient's treatmen t schedule is by using a diary. This method was rarely reported i n the included trials. Our group has observed three positive advances in recent years . T rials have become larger, have demonstrated lower risk of bi as (20/51) and have used self reported ratings (e.g. pain, disabi lity self report questionnaires, global perceived effect) as primary o utcomes on a more consistent basis. Most of our 51 trials were conducted immediately post treatmen t. With no long-term follow-up studies, it is hard for therapists to make a judgement in terms of using a particular technique in the ir practice. Single-session trials using manipulation are few. M any of the benets of a single manipulation are neurophysiologi cal. Future investigators need to look at the optimal dosage to ma ximise the effects of manipulation or mobilisation. The very low to l ow quality of evidence for cervical manipulation and the moderate quality of evidence for thoracic manipulation in treating neck pain can leave a professional therapist with a level of uncerta inty. The relevance of the evidence remains in question because (1) 32 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.participants in manual therapy trials are not blinded as a res ult of the nature of the intervention being delivered; and (2) pri mary outcome measures are often self reported (i.e. pain), causing th e participant to technically become 'the outcome assessor' who is not blinded to previous measures. Potential biases in the review process We used two independent review authors who were trained in the process and employed standardised forms. The effectivene ss of this strategy was conrmed by strong agreement (kappa analysi s) between review authors. We further attempted to limit syste matic error by searching for both published and unpublished litera ture. Randomised controlled trials often go unpublished if they do not yield positive results. Searching the grey literature makes the results of systematic reviews more comprehensive. Selection bias was avoided for citation screening and full-text screening, as each phase was conducted in duplicate and with fair to good agreement. Language bias was avoided to the extent of in- cluding all languages during study selection; however, we did not search non-English databases (i.e. Chinese databases). In this up- date, we captured one non-English trial ( Mansilla-Ferragud 2008 ). It is also important to analyse the risks inherent in and the l imita- tions of our systematic review update. A sweeping literatur e search is important for obtaining the full spectrum of results of app lying manipulation or mobilisation for neck pain. Accordingly, it is im- portant that an effort be made to search multiple language-bas ed databases. In our grey literature search, one non-published thesis ( Khoury 2002 ) was uncovered but did not meet our selection criteria. Pub- lication bias cannot be ruled out. The asymmetrical appearance o f the funnel plot (see Figure 3 ) suggests the presence of publication bias. Publication bias was a matter of concern during the system atic review process. Many study authors tend to submit only trials with positive results for publication in peer-reviewed journals. This can lead to overestimation of results. Fewer than 10 trials were included in each plot, further reducing the meaning of these data. Addi- tionally, nine of 13 trials listed as ongoing trials (those con ducted longer than ve years ago) conducted during the period from 1995 to 2010 ( Groeneweg 2010 ;Gudavalli 2006 ;Guerriero 1997 ;Shammsuddin 2010 ;Stokke 1995 ;Tanaka 1995 ) may further support the notion of publication bias, especially if a \"worse-case scenario\" that a ll trials are negative is considered. As we know, many negative t rials never reach publication. Note that we did search the Internet an d databases for all trials included in the 'ongoing' list, and w e wrote to each study author but received no response. Sources of random error were limited by use of two independent review authors who used a standardised tool during the data e x- traction process. Reliability of the risk of bias tool was asse ssed byGraham 2012 for the Cervical Overview Group (COG) and was considered acceptable. Last, we predetermined our primaryand secondary outcomes; this limited the random error associat ed with accepting articles that discussed a broad variety of outcome s. Future updates of our review could benet from addressing a di - verse range of factors that may help to reduce systematic error . It may be appropriate, for example, to examine the pattern of re sults based on country of origin, and to explore why this pattern exi sts. Additional possibilities include examining results on the b asis of therapist experience or provision of primary care as opposed t o secondary care. Pooling of results according to type of neck dis- order and length of injury may or may not be important for the magnitude of effects. Furthermore, risk of time lag bias mean s that positive trials may be published faster than negative t rials. It is important to search the grey literature to nd all trials. F uture updates will be more informative if review authors can identi fy a greater number of trials related to the topic under review. L ast, in the future, we must scrutinise studies on the basis of conflicts o f interest due to funding from donors. Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews For acute whiplash-associated disorder (WAD), we retrieved no evidence (0 trials; Shaw 2010 ). Although we assessed 15 trials on WAD, we found no trials that reported on mobilisation or mani p- ulation provided as a single stand-alone therapy compared wit h inactive treatment or other treatment interventions. For su bacute WAD, weak evidence favoured manipulation in the short term; concerns regarding the rigor of methods used were noted (weak quality, one trial; T easell 2010 ). Our ndings are consistent with this evidence. For cervical radiculopathy, no evidence was found on manipula- tion or mobilisation compared with inactive treatment. Howev er, we found one trial ( Ragonese 2009 ) suggesting that mobilisation alone is equal to exercise alone at short-term follow-up for pai n. This very low quality of evidence statement is consistent with nd- ings of the Thoomes 2013 systematic review on all forms of inter- vention for cervical radiculopathy. For people with acute, subacute and chronic neck pain, manipu- lation more effectively reduced pain immediately following t reat- ment when contrasted with inactive treatment (low to moderate quality, four trials; Clar 2014 ;Furlan 2012 ).Posadzki 2011 (one trial) compared one osteopathic manipulation versus a sham u l- trasound and reported signicant longitudinal change for ind i- viduals with chronic neck pain. We found eight trials assessin g non-specic neck pain and suggesting that a single manipulatio n reduces pain more effectively immediately post treatment or i n the short term compared with a control. We suggest that evidence continues to be of lowor very lowquality, as trial results coul d not be pooled. Furthermore, when we compared the effectiveness of several sessions of manipulation versus several sessions o f mobili- sation, we found high- to moderate-quality evidence showing t hat these two manual therapy interventions are equally effectiv e in 33 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.improving pain, function, quality of life, patient satisfact ion and global perceived effect. These ndings are consistent with tho se of the Neck Pain Task Force review ( Hurwitz 2008 ) and Furlan 2012 systematic review. We found moderate-quality evidence sug- gesting that manipulation is superior to medication (NSAIDs a nd analgesics) for pain relief at immediate-, intermediate- and long- term follow-up based on ndings of a large trial ( Bronfort 2012 ) and two smaller trials ( Giles 1999 ;Madson 2010 ). Our ndings contrast with those of Furlan 2012 , who concluded that manipu- lations are similar to medication in providing pain relief at short- term follow-up. We agree with Scholten Peeters 2013 andWalser 2009 that tho- racic manipulation is benecial when contrasted with a placebo intervention, but we noted no differences from other treatme nt. We found one trial that favoured cervical manipulation over th o- racic manipulation ( Puentedura 2011 ) and two trials that showed thoracic manipulation to be equally effective when compared wi th thoracic mobilisation ( ). The ndings of Huisman 2013 were comparable with our own. For participants with acute/subacute or chronic or mixed non-spe - cic neck pain, mobilisation reduced pain when contrasted with no treatment (low quality, three trials; Furlan 2012 ). However, no difference in chronic non-specic neck pain was noted when mobilisation was contrasted with placebo (low quality, one tri al; Furlan 2012 ). Contrary to this nding, our review found two tri- als (57 participants) provided low- or very low-quality eviden ce showing no pain relief. Finally, we found that certain forms o f mo- bilisation (AP) are superior to other forms (rotatory or trans versal mobilisation) for providing pain relief at immediate follo w-up. T o our knowledge, no other systematic review has reported this very low level of evidence nding. A U T H O R S ' C O N C L U S I O N S Implications for practice What is benecial? For individuals with acute/subacute neck pain, thoracic manipulation provided short-term neck pain relief, a nd for those with acute and chronic neck pain, it further improved function when contrasted with an inactive control. For acute/ subacute neck pain, multiple sessions of cervical manipulation provided better pain relief and functional improvement than wereattained with certain oral medications such as varied combinati ons of NSAIDs, long-term follow-up. What has a similar effect? For individuals with acute and chronic neck pain, cervical manipulation versus mobilisation produced similar results in neck pain reduction, functional improvemen t, quality of life and global perceived effect at immediate-, shor t- and intermediate-term follow-up. A similar pattern was obser ved when thoracic mobilisations were contrasted with thoracic man ip- ulation techniques in chronic neck pain. Given the risk of rare b ut devastating adverse events linked to cervical manipulation, cervi- cal mobilisation may be the technique of choice when treatment of the cervical region is needed. As minor transient adverse ev ents appeared to be similar in the thoracic region, both thoracic mo - bilisation and manipulation appear to be reasonable option s for the treatment of patients with neck pain. Implications for research Meta-analysis of data across trials and sensitivity analysis were hampered by the wide spectrum of comparisons, treatment char- acteristics and dosages. Factorial designs would help determi ne active treatment agent(s) within a treatment mix. Phase II tri als would help to identify the most effective treatment characteri stics and dosages. Greater attention to methodological quality con tin- ues to be needed, as is protection against publication bias. St udy designs of highest quality are needed to assess efcacy for mob il- isation in neck pain. As manipulation has the potential to pro - duce serious adverse effects, and as the present evidence shows no difference in effectiveness when compared with mobilisation, we suggest that additional trials on manipulation would be a ma tter of secondary priority.

Primary outcomes were an 11-point Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPS), the Neck Disability Index (NDI), and a 15-point Global Rating of Change (GRC) scale to measur e perceived change in health status. Neck active range of motion (AROM) was a secondary outcome. Outcome s were collected at baseline and at 2, 4 and 6 weeks (GRC was not collected at baseline). As the goal o f the study was to prepare parameter estimates, hypothesis testing was not done. We determined cl inically important changes by comparing point estimates of within-participant changes for NPS and NDI vs thei r established minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs). MCIDs for NPS and NDI are 2 points and 10% cha nge, respectively. We calculated the percentage of participants in each group who reported moderate or higher improvement on the GRC at each follow-up. For neck AROM, changes greater than published value s of minimal detectable change (MDC) were considered noticeable changes. Between-group differences at 6 weeks in primary outcomes were used to estimate sample size Participants Mechanical neck pain Interventions Multi-modal neck programme (MNP) that includes electrothermal m odalities, active exercises and some form of manual therapy (commonly non-thrust) directed at the cerv ical spine vs thoracic thrust manipulation (TTM) Outcomes Pain, disability, AROM, global rating of improvement Starting date 2010 Contact information Shamsuddin Khoja, Samannaaz, Daliman, Daniel, Regina Sara , Piva Notes Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Calculations for number needed to treat and treatmen t advantage Term Deniton Per cent treatment advantage (%) Calculation of the clinically important difference or change in a per cent scale was estimated as follows. Karlberg 1996 data are used in this example. The assumption made was that a positive mean/median value is improvement and a negative value is deterioration. T reatment/Control Mean/Median; Mean/Median; Mean/Median; Mean/Median 54 (23); 31 (10); 56 (1); 55 (20) % improvement (treatment) equals the difference between the ch ange in the treatment group (23) divided by the treatment baseline (54), which equals 42.6% % improvement (control) equals the difference between the chang e in the control group (1) divided by the control baseline (56), which equals 1.8% T reatment advantage = 42.6% - 1.8% = 40.8% 211 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Table 1. Calculations for number needed to treat and treatmen t advantage (Continued) Number needed to treat (NNTB) For this example, Karlberg 1996 outcomes measured at short-term follow-up are used to derive the data Number needed to treat is the number of patients a clinician nee ds to treat to achieve a clinically important improvement in 1. If we assume the minimal clinicall y important difference to be 10% of the baseline mean in the control group, and the control gr oup mean at baseline is 56, then 10% of 56 is 5.6 The effect is baseline - nal value; therefore: for the experimental group, the effect is 54.0 - 31.0 = -23.0; an d for the control group, the effect is 56.0 - 55.0 = 1.0. Converting these to standard normal values means that: for the experimental group, z = (-5.6 + 23.0)/10.0 = 17.4/10.0 = 1 .74, which gives an area under the normal curve of 0.9591; and for the control group, z = (-5.6 + 1.0)/20.0 = -4.6/20.0 = -0.23, which gives an area under the normal curve of 0.4090. NNTB = 1 divided by the difference in areas under the normal curv e (experimental group - control group): 0.9591 - 0.4090 = 0.5500; and NNTB equals 1 divided by 0.5500 = 1.81, or 2 when grown to the lo west integer.

Criteria for a judgement of yes for sources of risk of bias 1. Was the method of randomisation adequate? Was a random (unpredictable) assignment sequence used? Exampl es of adequate methods are coin toss (for studies with two group s), rolling a dice (for studies with two or more groups), drawing of b alls of different colours, drawing of ballots with study grou p labels from a dark bag, computer-generated random sequence, pre-order ed sealed envelopes, sequentially ordered vials, telephon e call to a central ofce and pre-ordered list of treatment assignments. Examples of inadequate methods include alternation, birth d ate, social insurance/security number, date on which individua ls are invited to participate in the study and hospital registration number . 2. Was treatment allocation concealed? Was assignment generated by an independent person not respo nsible for determining the eligibility of individuals. Thi s person has no information about persons included in the trial and has no infl uence on the assignment sequence nor on the decision about eligi bility of patients for participation. Was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately pr evented during the study? 3. Was the participant blinded to the intervention? This item should be scored \"yes\" if index and control groups are indistinguishable for participants, or if blinding was test ed among participants and was found to be successful. 4. Was the care provider blinded to the intervention? This item should be scored \"yes\" if index and control groups are indistinguishable for care providers, or if blinding was tes ted among care providers and was found to be successful 5. Was the outcome assessor blinded to the intervention? Adequacy of blinding should be assessed for primary outcomes. This item should be scored \"yes\" if blinding was tested among o utcome assessors and was found to be successful or: for patient-reported outcomes for which the participant is the o utcome assessor (e.g. pain, disability): The blinding procedur e is adequate for outcome assessors if participant blinding is scor ed \"yes\"; for outcome criteria assessed during scheduled visits that sup pose a contact between participants and outcome assessors (e.g. clinical examination): The blinding procedure is adequate if pa rticipants are blinded, and if treatment or adverse effects of treatment cannot be noticed during clinical examination; for outcome criteria that do not suppose a contact with participan ts (e.g. radiography, magnetic resonance imaging): The blinding procedure is adequate if treatment or adverse effect s of treatment cannot be noticed when the main outcome is assesse d; for outcome criteria that are clinical or therapeutic events tha t will be determined by the interaction between participants a nd care providers (e.g. co-interventions, hospitalization lengt h, treatment failure), in which the care provider is the outcome a ssessor: The blinding procedure is adequate for outcome assessors if the it em for care providers is scored \"yes\"; and for outcome criteria that are assessed from data of the medical f orms: The blinding procedure is adequate if treatment or adve rse effects of treatment cannot be noticed in extracted data. Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? 233 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.6. Was the dropout rate described and acceptable? The number of participants who were included in the study but di d not complete the observation period or were not included in th e analysis must be described and reasons given. If the percentag e of withdrawals and dropouts does not exceed 20% for short-ter m follow- up, and 30% for long-term follow-up, and does not lead to substa ntial bias, a 'yes' is scored. (N.B. These percentages are arbit rary and are not supported by the literature.) 7. Were all randomly assigned participants analysed in the g roup to which they were allocated? All randomly assigned participants are reported/analysed i n the group to which they were allocated by randomisation for th e most important moments of effect measurement (minus missing value s), irrespective of non-compliance and co-interventions. 8. Are reports of the study free of the suggestion of selectiv e outcome reporting? T o assign a 'yes', the review author determines if all result s from all pre-specied outcomes have been adequately reported in the published report of the trial. This information can be obtain ed by comparing the protocol versus the report or, in the absence of the protocol, by assessing whether the published report includes enough information to permit this judgement. Other sources of potential bias 9. Were the groups similar at baseline regarding the most imp ortant prognostic indicators? T o receive a \"yes\", groups have to be similar at baseline regar ding demographic factors, duration and severity of complaint s, percentage of participants with neurological symptoms and value of main o utcome measure(s). 10. Were co-interventions avoided or similar? This item should be scored \"yes\" if no co-interventions were pro vided, or if they were similar between index and control group s. 11. Was compliance acceptable in all groups? The review author determines whether compliance with the inte rventions is acceptable, based on reported intensity, durati on, number and frequency of sessions for both index interventions and con trol interventions. For example, physiotherapy treatment is usually administered over several sessions; therefore it is necessa ry to assess how many sessions each participant attended. For s ingle-session interventions (e.g. surgery), this item is irrelevant. 12. Was timing of the outcome assessment similar in all group s? Timing of outcome assessment should be identical for all inter vention groups and for all important outcome assessments. Note: These instructions are adapted from van T ulder 2003 and from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011 ). Appendix 3. Data imputation rules The preliminary assumption made for imputation of missing v alues is that data were missing completely at random ( Little 1987 ). In other words, it was assumed that data were not missing as the r esult of factors confounded by the treatment effect. Sloop 1982 As information was available only on change scores: change score treatment (T) is the difference between follow-up t reatment pain score (mFT) and baseline treatment pain score (mBT); and change score control (C) is the difference between follow-up contro l pain score (mFC) and pre-baseline control pain score (mBC). Baseline Follow-up Difference T EF = - mFC E = T - C If EB = 0, then EF is equal to E. 234 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.The mean difference was calculated with the assumption that no b aseline differences in scores were present (EB = 00). For the conve rsion, the mean postscore difference was assumed to be due to differen ces in postscore values (EF), and then equals the post-follow-up difference (E). Appendix 4. Grading the quality of evidence - denition of domain s Study design refers to type of study (i.e. randomised, observational stud y). Limitations in design (quality) refers to the 12 risk of bias criteria noted in Appendix 2 . Consistency refers to similarity of results across studies. When all studi es are included in the meta-analysis, 'consistency' is dened as absence of statistical heterogeneity. In the case that not all s tudies are combined in a meta-analysis, 'consistency' is dened when all studies for the specic outcome lead to the same decision or recom mendation, and 'inconsistency' is present if the results of tw o or more studies lead to clinically different decisions or recommendati ons. Review authors use their judgement to decide whether inco nsistency is present when only one study leads to clinically different de cisions or recommendations. Directness (generalisability) refers to the extent to which the people, interventions and ou tcome measures are similar to those of interest. Precision of the evidence relates to the numbers of studies, participant s and events considered for each outcome. Imprecise data are dened as: only one study for an outcome, regardless of the sample size or the condence interval; multiple studies combined in a meta-analysis: The condence int erval is sufciently wide that the estimate is consistent with conflicting recommendations. For rare events, one should consid er the condence interval around the risk difference rather tha n the condence interval around the relative risk; and multiple studies not combined in a meta-analysis: The total sa mple size is underpowered to detect a clinically important difference between those who received the index intervention compared with those who received the control intervention. In t his case, a post hoc sample size calculation should be performed to d etermine adequate sample size for each outcome. Reporting (publication) bias should be considered present only if actual evidence of reporti ng bias rather than only speculation about reporting bias is found. The Cochrane Reporting Bias Methods Group describes the following types of reporting bias and de nitions. Publication bias: publication or non-publication of research n dings, depending on the nature and direction of results. Time lag bias: rapid or delayed publication of research nding s, depending on the nature and direction of results. Language bias: publication of research ndings in a particular language, depending on the nature and direction of results. Funding bias: reporting of research ndings, depending on ho w results align with the aspirations of the funding body. Outcome variable selection bias: selective reporting of some o utcomes but not others, depending on the nature and direction o f research ndings. Developed country biases: non-publication or non-indication of ndings, depending on whether study authors were based in developed or developing countries.

However, the combined effect of manipulation, mobilisation and soft tissue work may be benecial for global perceived effect and pa- tient satisfaction, at least over the short term. Mobili- sation or manipulation combined with exercise, deliv- ered as part of a programme, had lasting and clinically important benet for pain relief, functional improve- ment and global perceived effect in subacute/chronic mechanical neck disorders with or without headache. The addition of thoracic manipulation may be bene- cial for neck pain relief in (sub)acute whiplash-associ- ated disorders. It was not possible to determine which technique or dosage was most benecial, or if certain subgroups beneted more from one form of care than another. Evidence was insufcient to allow conclusions regarding neck disorders based on radicular ndings 236 Manipulation and mobilisation for neck pain contrasted aga inst an inactive control or another active treatment (Revie w) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.

D I F F E R E N C E S B E T W E E N P R O T O C O L A N D R E V I E W Our protocol was published in 2002. We have noted some differe nces from our original protocol. The term for type of participant as 'neck disorder with headache ' was changed to 'cervicogenic headache'. Diagnostic criteria remain the same. Mechanical neck disorder was changed to neck pain , but the criteria remained the same. Interventions were subgrouped by region of the body manipul ated. Emerging evidence has revealed differences per region. This information was obtained by sensitivity analysis. We added a grey literature search: clinicaltrials.gov. A research librarian was hired and developed sensitive and sp ecic search strategies. Primary outcome categories remain the same, but specic outcome s have evolved over the years. The body of evidence was assessed by the Strength of Evidence as sessment, which has been changed to the GRADE system. Original methods used the Jadad Scale. The risk of bias system is now used, as recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . The post hoc power analysis for meaningful SMD was discontinu ed.
