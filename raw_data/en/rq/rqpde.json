Dr. Ken Van Winkle President, New Mexico State University Alamogordo6 About NMSU Alamogordo ABOUT NMSU ALAMOGORDO New Mexico State University Alamogordo (NMSU-A) is situated in the foothills, at the base of the Sacramento Mountains. This vantage point overlooks the city of Alamogordo and the Tularosa Basin. The service area of the college includes Holloman Air Force Base (HAFB), White Sands Missile Range, and stretches beyond the view to include the Mescalero Apache Reservation and approximately twenty villages and towns in Otero County. Much of the south central New Mexico region benets from the convenient location of the campus. NMSU-A was established in 1958 with an initial enrollment of 278 students. The classes were held at night on the Alamogordo High School campus. The objective of this post-secondary educational venture was to serve the military and civilian personnel from HAFB, as well as students from the local non-military population. Over the years enrollment has expanded. At the same time, the number and the character of students' objectives have also grown. The basic two- year traditional university-credited education has been expanded and enriched. NMSU-A has evolved from offering only two-year traditional education courses to providing career/technical programs and courses for personal enrichment as well as selected bachelor completion programs through New Mexico State University (NMSU) Las Cruces Distance Education. NMSU-A is a two-year comprehensive community college dedicated to the concept of high-quality, cost-effective education that meets the needs of a diverse community. While some students continue to value the long established core courses, others seek alternatives to the traditional liberal arts education. Mission of the College The mission of New Mexico State University Alamogordo is to provide quality learning opportunities for individuals in the diverse communities we serve. Vision Statement New Mexico State University at Alamogordo provides support, inspiration, and intellectual challenge for the students in the diverse communities we serve. We prepare students to be critical and creative thinkers, effective communicators, goal-oriented, socially conscious, prepared for academic and career success, and lifelong learners. Core Values We Value Excellence in education as a lifelong opportunity to increase productivity, expand visions, and encourage enjoyment of learning.

Developmental Evaluation Developmental Evaluation At the time of registration, the academic skill level of all entering rst-time students is evaluated using ACT and/or SAT scores combined with High School GPA, and if available, the NMSU Math Placement Exam score. For students without placement information, the NMSU Mathematics Placement Exam (MPE) or Accuplacer will be administered. Any new student may choose to take the MPE in an effort to place into a higher level math course than was indicated by the student's ACT/SAT score(s) and high school GPA. More information about placement can be found at http://nmsua.edu/students/. Placement scores are valid for one year. Developmental Courses in English - Students who score below 16 on the ACT English exam (or below parallel scores on Accuplacer) will be placed into appropriate developmental English courses (prex CCDE) before enrolling in ENGL 111G. Students scoring between 13 and 15 on the ACT English exam (or between parallel scores on Accuplacer) may be placed into ENGL 111G and co-requisite support courses. Advisors will assist students in determining the best sequence of courses toward meeting their academic goals. Developmental Courses in Reading - Students who score below 15 on the ACT Reading exam will be placed into appropriate developmental Reading course or course(s) (prex CCDR). Students who score below 13 on the ACT Reading will take courses through Adult Education before enrolling in CCDR110. Developmental Courses in Math - Students who score below 16 on the ACT mathematics exam, and who did not achieve a qualifying score on the NMSU Math Placement Exam (MPE), will be placed into the appropriate developmental mathematics course(s) (prex CCDM). Students are not allowed to enroll in any other math courses at NMSU until successfully completing pre-requisite CCDM course(s). Transfer Students NMSU evaluates eligible courses for NMSU transfer equivalency from postsecondary institutions that are regionally accredited or are candidates for regional accreditation. Credits from non-accreditedinstitutions may be evaluated after the student has shown acceptable performance at NMSU for two semesters of full time enrollment. NMSU Colleges may have additional requirements for course transfer; please contact the College for more information. Transfer students are subject to the same graduation requirements as all NMSU-A degree seeking students. Fifteen (15) of the last 30 credit hours for every degree to be awarded from NMSU-A must be earned from an NMSU campus. Transfer Students- Admission Requirements 1.Have at least a 2.0 cumulative grade point average (GPA) and be eligible to return to the college or university last attended. (Any transfer student who has less than a 2.0 cumulative GPA from his/her previous college(s) and/or vocational school(s) must submit a letter of appeal to the Admissions Appeal Board for admission to NMSU-A.) 2.Formal application for admission. A $20 non-refundable admission fee payable upon application. 3.Must provide ofcial transcripts sent directly from the University Student Records Ofce or each previously attended institution to the NMSU-A Admissions & Records Ofce or ofcial transcripts will be accepted if delivered in person only if in a sealed envelope from the granting institution and with current issue date. Ofcial transcripts must be received before the date of registration. 4.High school transcripts and GED scores will be waived when a student has completed 30 academic semester hours at a previously attended regionally accredited college/university. However, these transcripts may be required for Financial Aid. 5.Any student who conceals the fact that he/she has attended another college or university and has not submitted a transcript for each institution-whether or not credit was earned-will be subject to immediate suspension. 6.NMSU will uphold academic and judicial suspensions from other colleges and universities. General Requirements for Transfer Credits Credit will be awarded for transfer courses as follows: 1.Grades earned in courses taken at other institutions are not included in the calculation of the NMSU GPA, except for grades earned by approved National Student Exchange students. 2.A grade of D or better is required to receive NMSU credit for courses identied as having an NMSU equivalent. 3.Colleges or departments may require a grade of C- or higher for courses required in their programs. 4.Any lower-division course from another institution receiving transfer credit from NMSU at the 300 or above level will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 5.Each college determines which transferred courses are applicable toward a degree or a minor. 6.Transcripts may need to be reevaluated when students transfer from one NMSU campus to another. 7.Currently enrolled students who do not receive a passing grade for a class taken within the NMSU system can receive transfer credit for the course taken at an outside institution. However, the student may not receive the credit for the equivalent NMSU (system) course. Student Responsibility Planning for effective transfer with maximum efciency is ultimately the student's responsibility. Responsible transfer planning includes early14 Transfer Students and regular consultation with the intended degree-granting institution to assure that all pre-transfer coursework will meet the requirements of the desired degree. NMSU maintains a database (http://nmsudirect.nmsu.edu/) of commonly transferred courses from numerous institutions. Courses included in the database at the time the student is admitted to NMSU will automatically transfer to NMSU, provided the student follows all guidelines (see Currently Enrolled NMSU Students below). If a transferred course does not exist in the database, it is the student's responsibility to provide the departmental faculty with sufcient materials (e.g. catalog description, syllabi, etc.) to determine if any of the department's courses may be equivalent to the credits being transferred. Evaluation of Transfer Credits NMSU has 3 levels of course credit transfer. Once a student has been admitted to NMSU, they are awarded credit for equivalent courses accordingly. Following award of credit as described in Levels 1 and 2 (below), application of any additional credit transfer via specic Program Articulation agreements will be approved by the student's academic department and dean, including additional courses in the major that may count toward a degree or a minor but are not included in a Program Articulation. Level 1 Automatic course-to-course equivalency credit transfer from colleges/ universities in the state of New Mexico, per the New Mexico Higher Education Department (NM HED) articulation modules. Eligible credits for Level 1 transfers will be automatically applied to the student's transcript, provided minimal grade requirements are met. Level 1 equivalency includes 1.New Mexico State Common Core general education courses 2.New Mexico State articulated academic programs (e.g. Business, Early Childhood Education, and NM Nursing Education Curriculum). Level 2 Faculty established NMSU course-to-course equivalency transfer: 1.Equivalency is determined by designated departmental faculty in the department/program in which the equivalent course is offered, and may include review of course description, syllabus and/or interaction with the other institution. If a course equivalency does not exist in the database, it is the student's responsibility to provide departmental faculty with sufcient materials to determine if any of the department's courses may be equivalent to the credits being transferred. 2.Credit for courses transcripted with NMSU equivalency will count toward the degree/major. 3.Credit for courses with no NMSU equivalence will be transcripted as 100E (lower level) or 300E (upper level) and may or may not count as credit toward a specic degree. Departmental faculty may accept the \"E\" course as elective credit toward the degree, or as substituting for a course not applied universally. Level 3 Specic Program Articulation between an NMSU program/department and a program/department at another institution. 1.Program Articulation with other institutions is monitored at the department/program level in accordance with articulation agreements, and may include credit transfers that are applicable onlyto the specic degree articulated (i.e. credit for courses may change depending on degree student declares). 2.Because Level 3 transfer credit is degree specic, transcripts must be re-evaluated when a student changes their major or college- Level 3 transfer credits are not applied universally. National Student Exchange (NSE) Courses transferred back to the NMSU System by students participating in the National Student Exchange (NSE) Program will be evaluated as NMSU (system) courses and recorded on the student's academic record. All computable grades earned will be included in calculating the student's cumulative grade point average. Currently Enrolled NMSU Students Currently enrolled students must obtain prior approval from their academic department head and dean before courses taken at another institution will be applied toward meeting NMSU graduation requirements. Currently enrolled students who do not receive a passing grade for a class taken at NMSU can receive transfer credit for the course taken at an outside institution. However, the student may not receive the credit for the equivalent NMSU course. Transferring Courses to Fulll the New Mexico General Education Common Core During the 2005 New Mexico Legislative session, Senate Bill 161, consistent with requirements of state law (Chapter 224 of the Laws of New Mexico, 1995 as amended) was signed into law to further enhance and facilitate the articulation of general education courses among New Mexico's colleges and universities. In accordance with policies established by the New Mexico Higher Education Department, designated general education core courses successfully completed at any regionally accredited public institution of higher education in New Mexico are guaranteed to transfer to any New Mexico public institution. Students who have decided on a major and/or an institution at which to complete their studies should consult with an Academic Advisor at that particular institution to determine the most appropriate course selections. Students enrolling for the rst year of study at a New Mexico college or university and considering possible transfer into a certicate and/or degree program at another institution are encouraged to take the courses approved for transfer during their freshman and sophomore years of study. The core matrix of approved courses guaranteed to transfer and meet general education requirements at any New Mexico college or university can be found on the New Mexico Higher Education Department web site at www.hed.state.nm.us (http://www.hed.state.nm.us) . Courses are listed by institution, whether university or community college, under each of the ve general education areas. The courses for New Mexico State University are listed in the required courses section of this catalog. Transferring Courses Within Degree Programs To facilitate the transfer of courses within certain degree programs, New Mexico colleges and universities have collaborated to develop transferable discipline modules. These are made up of an agreed upon number of hours and courses. When discipline module courses are taken in addition to the 35 hour general education core, the total number of hours in a transfer module are approximately 64. For information on the transferable discipline module for Business, see the Las Cruces catalog College of Business chapter. For informationNew Mexico State University - Alamogordo 15 on the transferable discipline module for Early Childhood Education, see the College of Education chapter. Information on all available statewide transfer modules can be found on the New Mexico Higher Education Department web site at www.hed.state.nm.us (http:// www.hed.state.nm.us) . Transfer Credit Appeal Process All New Mexico public post-secondary institutions are required to establish policies and practices for receiving and resolving complaints from students or from other complainants regarding the transfer of coursework from other public institutions in the state. A copy of NMSU's transfer credit policy may be obtained from the University Student Records Ofce or from the: Deputy Secretary for Academic Affairs Higher Education Department 2048 Galisteo St. Santa Fe, New Mexico 87505-2100 International Student Admission The general policies of the university as outlined in this catalog apply to international as well as domestic students. However, some special policies are required by federal laws applicable only to international students. An international student is any individual attending NMSU while present in the United States on a non-immigrant student visa (F-1, F-2, J-1, J-2, H-4, NATO Visas, and possibly others such as students in protected refugee status). Legal immigrants (green card holders) should present documentation of their status to University Admissions and go through the same admission process as U.S. citizens. Federal Regulations The United States Department of Homeland Security has established rules for students in non-immigrant status, such as those with F-1 or J-1 visa types. Some of these rules include: 1.For immigration purposes, each student must maintain full-time student status a.Full time status for fall and spring semesters is dened as 12 or more credits for undergraduates (only 3 per semester allowable online). b.Full time status for summer is dened as 6 or more credits for undergraduates (only 3 per summer allowable online). c.Exceptions possible for nal semester. Consult ISSS ofcials for more details. 2.International students may not work off campus without authorization. On-campus employment may be authorized under certain conditions. 3.All international students must maintain an up-to-date record in the ISSS Ofce. This record must indicate the student's current living address, phone number, and email address. 4.Prior to admission, a prospective international student must demonstrate the following: Academic ability to succeed in the chosen course of study. Adequate nancial support to complete the chosen course of study.English language prociency as dened by the university. University Procedures for International Students Regular Undergraduate Admission and English Requirements After regular and full admission to an NMSU degree program, each international undergraduate student is administered an English Language Placement Test. Based on the results, the student is either assigned to SPCD 110 (http://nmsu.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2015-2016/ Undergraduate-Catalog/Courses/SPCD-ENGLISH-AS-A-SECOND- LANGUAGE/100/SPCD-110) (a bridge course designed to ensure success in ENGL 111 M ), or allowed to enroll directly into ENGL 111 M. International students excused from SPCD 110 (http:// nmsu.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2015-2016/Undergraduate-Catalog/ Courses/SPCD-ENGLISH-AS-A-SECOND-LANGUAGE/100/SPCD-110) will be required to take ENGL 111 M. The student may then be required to complete one or more regular English classes as required for a particular degree. Completing basic English courses at other U.S. institutions does not automatically satisfy the ENGL 111 M requirement. Equivalencies for SPCD 110 are determined by CELP , and equivalencies for ENGL 111 M or ENGL 111G are determined by the English department. CELP and the English Department reserve the right to require additional testing in cases of dramatic discrepancies between TOEFL/IELTS scores and ELPT , or in other unusual circumstances. In cases where further testing is required, students will have to take the TOEFL PBT (Paper Based Test). Placements will be based on those scores as follows: 519 and below = CELP , 520-529 = 110. 530+ = 111. In rare cases, exceptions to the above scoring and placements may be applicable. CELP reserves the right to identify cases where dramatic discrepancies exist between the ELPT and the original TOEFL or IELT score submitted for admission. In such cases, students may be asked to take the institutional Paper Based TOEFL (PBT). This test will be administered locally, in a timely fashion, and at the university's expense. Following the PBT a re-assessment of the student's English course placement will be made by CELP . Students voluntarily objecting to their ELPT score and placement in CELP are allowed to take the Institutional TOEFL one time only, at their own expense, for the purpose of re-evaluation of their English course placement by CELP . Conditional CELP Admission and English Requirements NMSU, via Center for English Language Programs (CELP), conducts an Intensive English Language Program (IELP) for undergraduate and graduate students prior to pursuing their degree programs at NMSU. International students in this program are admitted to the university for the sole purpose of studying English, with a guarantee of full admission to the university upon completion of the CELP program (subject to all other admission requirements). Only undergraduate students who are conditionally admitted and complete the full sequence of IELP courses will be admitted directly into ENGL 111M. Placing out of levels by retaking the TOEFL is not allowable once conditional admission status has been granted. Visit http://celp.nmsu.edu/ for full details. English Language Prociency NMSU requires a score of 520 (paper-based) or 68 (internet-based) or better on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), or a score of 6.0 on the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), for all international students both non-degree and degree seeking. International students may also demonstrate English prociency by satisfactorily completing NMSU's Center for English Language Programs (CELP) programs. A waiver of the TOEFL requirement may be considered for:16 Tuition, Fees, and Other Expenses 1.Students who are native speakers of English. 2.Students completing high school in the United States who (a) have attended the high school for at least two full semesters and (b) have scored in at least the 75th percentile in English on the ACT . 3.Students transferring from a junior college, or university in the United States who have earned a minimum of 30 acceptable semester credits (45 acceptable quarter credits) with a GPA of 2.0 or better (acceptable credit means classes that require a high prociency in both written and oral English). 4.Students demonstrating English-language prociency using methods accepted by the Ofce of University Admissions or ISSS Ofce. 5.Students enrolling in certain programs where English language prociency is not required. 6.Students completing coursework in CELP . Satisfactory completion of each level in CELP requires a nal grade of no less than 70% in all courses. Visit http://celp.nmsu.edu/ for full details. The university reserves the right to require any prospective international student to meet the TOEFL or IELTS requirement. Financial Support No nancial aid is available from NMSU for international students. The university reserves the right to require advance deposit of funds for any period deemed reasonable prior to granting admission. Each prospective international student must submit a current nancial support document with his/her application. This document must show that: 1.The person providing the nancial support has the necessary funds. 2.The funds can be transferred from the student's home country to the United States. Admission Restrictions International student admission may be prohibited based on one of the following conditions: 1.The dean of a chosen college, the department head of a chosen major, and the President of a Community College campus may refuse to grant admission. 2.There may be a disproportionate number of international students or a disproportionate number of a particular nationality in one department, college or community college. 3.Academic advisors may not be available. 4.Sufcient classroom-based courses are not available to maintain visa status (e.g. courses are online). All application material, including the application for admission, letters of recommendation, transcripts, national examination scores, transcripts from colleges or universities (with an English translation), test scores including the TOEFL. Pearson's IELTS, should be sent to the ISSS Ofce by the following recommended dates. Additionallly, proof of adequate nancial support should be sent directly to ISSS. For full consideration for undergraduate admission, ISSS maintains the following deadlines: Date Semester July 1 (application initiated) for fall semester July 15 (all documents submitted) for fall semester October 1* (Study Aboard and CELP Programs)for spring semester November 15 (application initiated) for spring semesterDecember 1 (all documents submitted)for spring semesters * Contact the Ofce of Education Abroad for exchange program admission deadlines, and CELP for intensive English program deadlines. Miscellaneous Regulations 1.All international students are required to have student health insurance. Insurance will be automatically billed to the student's account each semester. 2.New international students are not permitted to register until all ISSS requirements are met, including attending orientation and taking the English Language Placement Test. All international students are, therefore, required to report to the campus to which they were admitted. The following are the ofces that a student may need to report to: a.Las Cruces campus: International Student & Scholar Services, Garcia Annex, room 246 (exchange students need to report to the Ofce of Study Abroad) b.Do\u00f1a Ana Community College: International Student & Scholar Services, Garcia Annex, room 246 (exchange students need to report to the Ofce of Study Abroad) c.Alamogordo Community College: Ofce of Student Services, Student Services Building, second floor d.Carlsbad Community College: Ofce of Student Services, 150 University Drive, Room 111 e.Grants Community College: Ofce of Student Services, Walter Martinez Building, Main Ofce Complex 3.Students in nondegree exchange J-1 visa status must be engaged full time in a prescribed course of study as determined by the NMSU Responsible or Alternate Responsible Ofcer (RO/ARO).

Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Federal regulations require that nancial aid recipients meet certain academic standards to be eligible for federal nancial aid. To ensure that nancial aid recipients are making satisfactory academic progress, academic transcripts are reviewed at the end of each term to determine eligibility for the next term. All terms of attendance are reviewed, including periods in which the student did not receive nancial aid. All transfer credit hours are taken into account when satisfactory progress isreviewed. The Financial Aid SAP standards are not the same as NMSU's Academic Standards of Progress criteria. Elements of Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress: Qualitative Progress: Undergraduate students must maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 (a C- average). Grade point values are: A+ / A= 4.0, A- = 3.7, B+ = 3.3, B = 3.0, B- = 2.7, C+ = 2.3, C/ C- = 2.0, D+/ D/ D- = 1.0, F = 0. Grades of I, CR, RR, PR, NC, W, AU are not calculated in the GPA. Completion Rate: Students must complete a minimum of 70 percent of all coursework (registered credit hours) attempted at NMSU. Any course with a grade of withdraw (W), incomplete (I), repeats (RR), failure (F), audit (AU), or no credit (NC) is not considered completed coursework. Repeated courses are included in the calculation. Maximum Time Frame: Undergraduate students must complete their program within 150 percent of the published length required by the program. Students who have reached the maximum allowable time will be suspended from receiving nancial aid. Limited developmental/remedial hours are excluded from this calculation. Total attempted hours including repeated courses and transfer coursework are included in the student's maximum time frame calculation. Recipients of nancial aid grants and loans who drop credits or withdraw may be required to return all or a portion of awarded Title IV funds. Further information regarding the return of Title IV funds is available on the NMSU web site at http://fa.nmsu.edu/resources/ return-of-title-iv-funds/. Financial Aid Warning: \"Warning\" is a status assigned to a student who fails to make satisfactory academic progress at a school that evaluates satisfactory academic progress at the end of each payment period and/ or term, and chooses to allow students who fail its progress standards to continue to receive aid. If the student has not returned to satisfactory standing after this additional semester, he or she will be suspended from further nancial assistance until the satisfactory progress standards are met. Financial Aid Suspension: Students are suspended from receiving nancial aid if they do not meet satisfactory academic progress standards. Students on nancial aid suspension will not receive any form of federal or state nancial aid (grants, loans, work-study). Financial aid eligibility is reinstated when all standards of satisfactory progress are met. The Appeals Process: Students suspended from nancial aid may appeal the suspension if there are mitigating circumstances affecting their progress. Students who would like to appeal the suspension must submit an appeal form which can be obtained at the NMSU-A Financial Aid Ofce. They must also submit all required documentation to University Financial Aid and Scholarship Services. A committee will review the appeal and may grant reinstatement of nancial aid based on mitigating circumstances that directly contributed to decient academic performance. Appeals are evaluated on a term-by-term basis. All appeals, including relevant documentation, must be submitted by the semester deadline based on the current semester of enrollment. A student may appeal the termination of eligibility only twice during his or her career at New Mexico State University.

All regulations in this section of the catalog pertain to all the campuses housed with the NMSU System, this means that information for students pursuing Associate Degrees/Certicates, Bachelor's Degree, and Graduate Degrees/Certicates is within the section of the catalog. The regulations section is broken down into different areas: Academic Programs of Study Registration Academic Performance and Progress Grading Withdrawals Degree Applications, Graduation & Commencement Academic Standing and Probation Academic Misconduct and Grievances The University Student Records Ofce NMSU offers Associate, Baccalaureate, Master's and Doctoral degrees. NMSU also offers Certicates at the associate and graduate levels. Requirements for specic degrees and other designations are set forth by this catalog for the NMSU-Las Cruces (main) campus and the corresponding catalogs for the NMSU Community Colleges (Alamogordo, Carlsbad, Dona Ana and Grants). Additional Degree Designations As part of a degree program, students may also earn additional degree designations indicating elds of study such as majors, minors or concentrations. A major is dened as a recognized area of study in which there is an extensive and well-developed curriculum offered at the university, as well as adequate library resources and support services. A minor is based on courses that encompass a recognized eld of study outside the student's major. A concentration is based on a collection of coursework in an area that is part of a major program of study. Degrees and additional designations awarded, limited to majors, minors, and concentrations, will be noted on the student's transcript. Catalog Effective Period Each annual catalog edition is effective Summer Session I through Spring Semester and is considered active for a six year period for all campuses. Curricular requirements (course requirements and number of credits required) for a specic degree or other designation may be met by completing all of the course requirements as set forth by the catalog in effect at rst matriculation, or any subsequent catalog, provided the selected catalog is considered active when the requirements for graduation are met. For all other matters, the current catalog is controlling. NMSU reserves the right to withdraw courses at any time, change fees, rules, calendar, curriculum, degree programs, degree requirements, graduation procedures and any other requirements affecting students. Except as otherwise stated here, changes will become effective whenever the proper authorities so determine and will apply to both prospective students and those already enrolled.26 The NMSU System Academic Regulations Application for Degree/Graduation or Certicate Upon completion of all requirements for degrees and certicates, students will not receive their degrees automatically. In order to receive the degree or certicate, students must submit an application and pay the required fee in the semester in which the student expects to graduate or complete the degree or certicate requirements. Specied in the academic calendar for each semester is the deadline for all applications. The application must indicate/ note all designations earned. After awarding of the degree, you cannot add any additional designations. Students who will be completing two degrees/certicates in the same semester must apply for graduation and pay the fee for each degree separately. Students applying for graduate degrees or certicates must satisfy requirements as described in the Master's, Certicates, and Doctoral Degree sections below. Students who do not meet requirements or elect not to graduate after ling an application need to re-apply in a subsequent semester and pay another fee. Multiple Degrees and Designations A student may earn more than one degree or multiple degree designations by completing all of the requirements in an appropriate catalog for each degree or designation. Students completing requirements for more than one degree must apply for and pay the application fee for each degree to be awarded. Upon completion of all requirements, multiple majors for a single degree (e.g., B.A., Major in Art; Major in Anthropology) and multiple bachelor's degrees (e.g., B.A. and B.S.) will be noted on the student's academic record/transcript and may also be granted at one commencement. Degree Revocation The Board of Regents reserves the right to revoke a degree should it be determined upon investigation that the degree requirements were not properly met. A degree revocation must be in accordance with NMSU policy and related rules. Honorary Degrees Ceremonial Honorary Degrees may be awarded in accordance with NMSU policy and rules as set forth in the NMSU Regents Policy Manual and the related Administrative Rules and Procedures. Community College Certicate A Community College may offer two types of certicates, the Certicate of Achievement and/or the Certicate of Completion. Certicates may be awarded independently from any degree program. Certicate of Achievement The Certicate of Achievement is a program of study less than 16 credits and is not eligible for Federal nancial aid. This Certicate provides employment related and/or career enhancing skills necessary to succeed in a job or a chosen eld of study. These courses can be a subset of those required for a corresponding Certicate of Completion or Applied Associates Degree. These certicates are recorded on the student's transcript.Certicate of Completion The Certicate of Completion requires a minimum of 16 credits (other Title IV requirements must be met to be eligible for nancial aid) and has been approved through the academic review process. These courses can be a subset of those required for a corresponding Applied Associates Degree. These certicates are recorded on the student's transcript. Requirements for certicates are found in the respective catalogs and sections concerning these programs. The following requirements apply to all certicates. 1.Minimum Credit Hours : The number of credit hours varies from certicate to certicate. Students must successfully complete the total number of credit hours as outlined in the respective catalogs and sections describing these certicates. 2.GPA requirement: Students must earn a minimum grade of C- in courses required for the certicate. In addition, students must have a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or better in all courses taken at NMSU or one of its community colleges . 3.Residency: A minimum of 6 credits earned toward the certicate must be completed at NMSU or one of its community colleges. If the certicate requires fewer than 6 credits, all credits must be completed at NMSU or one of its community colleges. Associate's Degree Associate's degrees are of two types. The academic associate's degree prepares students to transfer to a baccalaureate program and generally includes credits toward the rst two years of a four-year degree. Academic associate's degrees include the Associate of Arts, the Associate of Science, and other named degrees that link to a specic major (the Associate of Education, for example). Other associate degrees, typically called Associate of Applied Science, prepare students for entry into the workforce. Credits for these programs may or may not apply toward a four-year degree. Students interested in transferring to NMSU or another four-year institution should check the appropriate sections of the university catalog for more information. Requirements for the two-year associate degrees are found in the respective catalogs and sections concerning these degrees. The following requirements apply to all associates degrees: 1.Minimum Credit Hours: a minimum of 60 credits (excluding \"N\" sufx courses).

Master's Accelerated Program (MAP) The master's accelerated program provides an opportunity for academically qualied undergraduate students to begin working on a master's degree during their junior and senior years while completing a bachelor's degree. Typically, a bachelor's degree requires four years to complete and a master's degree requires an additional two years. The master's accelerated programs allow students the opportunity to complete a graduate program in an accelerated manner. Undergraduate students may apply for acceptance to a Master's Accelerated Program available at New Mexico State University after completing 60 semester hours of undergraduate coursework of which a minimum of 25 semester credit hours must be completed at New Mexico State University and apply towards the undergraduate major. The grade point average must be a minimum of 3.0; departments participating in the master's accelerated program may have requirements that exceed these minimum requirements. It is the student's responsibility to meet with their nancial aid advisor. Awards may be adjusted to reflect enrollment in an undergraduate/graduate program. Graduate departments within the colleges may allow academically qualied undergraduate students to substitute a maximum of 12 graduate course credits for elective courses in an undergraduate degree program. Graduate programs have the discretion to use up to 12 credits of NMSU coursework (450 level or higher) that can logically be appliedtowards the completion of master's program of study. A grade of B or higher in this coursework will be required . Program Participation Requirements: 1.Students must obtain prior approval by the graduate program 2.Student's course work must be general or discipline electives in the student's undergraduate course of study. No required courses from the undergraduate program will be accepted towards the Master's Accelerated Program. 3.Students will enroll in approved graduate level courses.

The DNSP program provides formal mentoring supporting application process to Graduate School. Upon awarding of the Bachelor's degree and formal admissions into a master's/graduate program at NMSU, the approved credits (up to 12) will be recorded on both the undergraduate and the graduate transcript. Interdisciplinary Master's Degree Interdisciplinary studies, at New Mexico State University, are intended for individuals specializing in programs that require the integration of more than one discipline to fully engage in the eld of study. The programs provide a mechanism to address emerging scholarship, innovation and research, as well as, allow graduate students to engage in emerging technologies that optimize their education outside the traditional disciplinary boundaries. An Interdisciplinary study takes advantage of traditional academic training within specic departments and also allows students to customize their own career preparation. In these programs, a coherent common core is expected and is intended to combine existing courses across disciplines to meet unique objectives. The interdisciplinary studies option should not be used in cases where the applicants' objectives can be realized by admission to a specic department with a degree program, and inclusion of up to two minor areas in the program of study. Admission Students interested in pursuing an Interdisciplinary Master's Degree (IMAS) degree must meet with the Graduate School for advisement. The advisement session will include information on completing the IMAS admission application: 1.Develop a proposal for interdisciplinary studies 2.Create the IMAS graduate committee 3.Once the student's graduate committee is designated, the committee can require additional materials such as a statement of interest, letters of recommendation, GRE or GMAT scores and a personal interview. 4.Complete the IMAS referral form and procure committee members IMAS program approval. 5.Procure academic department head IMAS referral form approval. 6.Submit IMAS referral form and proposal for interdisciplinary studies to Graduate School for admissions.30 The NMSU System Academic Regulations Degree(s) Awarded Students receive a Master of Arts (MA) or a Master of Science (MS) and a concentration in the designated interdisciplinary study area.

Students may take six credits in departments that do not grant a graduate degree, but the courses must be numbered 450 or above and be pertinent to the program of study. 3.The majority of the departments involved in the student's program will be master's degree granting departments. The student is expected to take at least 15 credits in the primary area of study within one department. The department selected by the student will receive a copy of the student's application for admissions to the Graduate School. In addition, the student is required to select a minor area of study in another department that consists of at least 9 graduate credit hours. 4.The student will form a committee composed of members of the graduate faculty and select an advisor who will chair the committee. The chair must be from the primary department where the student has taken at least 15 credit hours listed in the proposal submitted. The other committee member must be from the department in which the student has selected a minor area of study from the approved list. 5.The student will be required to submit the Candidacy Form after they have satisfactorily completed 12 credits. 6.The program will meet all requirements of a master's degree, with the interpretation, that \"major eld\" includes courses from two or more departments and in the designated interdisciplinary study area. 7.The program of study will include the completion of a research thesis or project. The work may be submitted in the form of a publishable manuscript, technical report, thesis or creative option. 8.The student may enroll on a part-time basis keeping in mind that coursework cannot be more than seven years old at the time of the nal examination. 9.The student will be administered a nal comprehensive exam that is consistent with the department selected for the primary area of study. For example, if a department requires a written exam, the student in the interdisciplinary masters will also be required to take a written exam. 10. The nal oral comprehensive exam will consist of questions pertinent to the area of study and the defense of the research thesis or project. In both cases, an integrated approach to the areas of study chosen should be followed. 11. All other rules for graduate study at NMSU must be followed. Thesis/Non-thesis Option As with any graduate student, the student in interdisciplinary studies can select to follow a thesis or non-thesis option. Students enrolled in the thesis option register for six thesis credits. Students not wishing to follow the thesis option will be required to complete a project report. The projectmust reflect the interdisciplinary nature of the program which the student is pursuing. Comprehensive Exam Students in interdisciplinary studies take a comprehensive exam composed of questions designed by the student's committee. The committee consists of two individuals in the area of study, the dean's representative who must be outside of the department/program/ interdisciplinary study option, and a committee chair. Second Master's Degree A student who has earned one master's degree at NMSU may be allowed to count a maximum of six semester credits earned on the rst degree toward a second master's degree, if those credits t into a logical graduate program. The number of shared credits may be increased for joint degree programs. Teacher Licensure Students wishing to take graduate courses for licensure, renewal of licensure or for personal enrichment must be fully admitted to a department in order to do so. Undeclared students may not register for teacher licensure classes. Endorsement is available at both the elementary and secondary levels in bilingual education, TESOL (Teaching of English as a Second Language), reading and special education. Endorsement is also available in early childhood education at the elementary level. Contact curric- instr@nmsu.edu for more information.

Students must complete the general application for the Graduate School and they should also check with the admitting department for specic departmental requirements. Residency and Credit Requirements The specialist in education degree requires a minimum of 30 credits beyond the master's degree, including research, intern experiences and graduate courses. Twenty-four of these credits must be completed at NMSU to meet the campus residency requirements. Students must maintain a 3.0 GPA, no more than 6 credits of C level work are allowed for this program. Program of Study It is recommended that during the rst semester of enrollment each beginning graduate student should prepare a complete program of study with the student's advisor. The program of study can be tentative, should be kept in the student's le within the department, and is not considered an \"Application for Admission to Candidacy. \" Major Field All course work taken for the degree should apply directly, through a logical program of study, to the specialty which candidate has selected. Each department is responsible for dening the required sequence of courses.New Mexico State University - Alamogordo 31 Candidacy Following the successful completion of 12 credits beyond the master's degree, the student is eligible for admission to candidacy. With the achievement of candidacy, a committee is appointed to work with the candidate on the remainder of the program. The committee consists of three members of the graduate faculty in the College of Education. Internship Each candidate will earn from three to six semester credits in an internship. This experience will consist of supervised performance of duties related to the candidate's specialty. The student's department will determine the structure of the internship and a research project will be conducted in conjunction with the internship. Oral Examination The oral examination committee will consist of the student's committee and a dean's representative appointed from the graduate faculty by the dean of the Graduate School. This committee will conduct an oral examination at the conclusion of the research project and no earlier than the candidate's last semester of enrollment. The examination will consist of a defense of the project along with general questions on subject matter related to the candidate's eld of study. Any candidate who fails the oral examination may upon recommendation of the advisor and with the approval of the graduate dean, be granted a second examination after a lapse of at least one semester. Failure in the second examination disqualies the candidate from obtaining the degree. Time Limit The specialist in education degree must be completed within seven years following admission to the program. Students cannot include any course work on their program of study that is more than seven years old at the time of the nal oral examination. Doctoral Degrees The doctoral degree requires signicant scholarly study beyond the master's program. Prospective candidates are expected to hold bachelors or master's degrees from accredited institutions, based on curricula that include the prerequisites for graduate study in the department of their subject. To be considered for admission to a doctoral program, the applicant must have a grade-point average of at least 3.0. Prospective candidates are urged to consult the department in which they wish to study for information concerning specic requirements. Professional Doctoral Degrees Doctor of Economic Development (DED) Students enrolled in the Doctor of Economic Development are required to complete and pass a comprehensive examination. Since a dissertation is not required, students are expected to complete an internship experience and a project paper as dened by their program. They can embark on the project paper once they have completed and passed their comprehensive examination. Students are not required to take 700 level dissertation hours. However, they are expected to complete at least 12 credits at the 600 level including ECDV 694 (Internship) and ECDV 699 (Doctoral Project). A project paper must be nalized using a similar submission process as the dissertation (see the \"Finalizing the Doctoral Dissertation\"). On the front page, after the title of the paper, the student should indicate that it is a project paper. Students completing projects papers do not need to complete the earned doctoral survey. The paper must be submittedto the Graduate School for format review on or before the deadline. The form and style of the paper must comply with regulations given in the \"Guidelines for Preparing a Thesis or Dissertation. \" These guidelines also contain detailed information on the dissertation/project paper- approval process as well as information on binding. Candidates are encourages to consult with the Graduate School on format, deadlines and procedures before nal typing. The project paper is not complete until copies have been accepted for binding by the staff of Branson Library and until the microlm agreement form has been completed and received in Branson Library. Doctor of Education (Ed.D) The degree of Doctor of Education demonstrates prociency in a program of graduate study in which the emphasis is in preparation for performance in professional education. This program is intended primarily for students pursuing careers in which teaching, administration or school services are predominate rather than those in research. The Ed.D. Degree in curriculum and instruction is offered in the Department of Curriculum and Instruction; the degree in educational administration is offered in the Department of Educational Leadership and Administration. The requirements for doctoral degrees in the two departments of the College of Education have the following distinguishing elements: 1.The qualifying examination consists of a written and an oral section, both of which are administered prior to admission to the program. Acceptance for doctoral admission is equivalent to the successful completion of the qualifying examination. Residency of at least two consecutive semesters cannot commence until the semester after the qualifying examination is successfully completed. 2.Comprehensive examinations usually are administered three times annually. The written examination tests the major and related areas of concentration and is administered after successful completion of the orals within two weeks' time. A student who fails any part of the comprehensive examination may present him or herself for re- examination of the failed part of the exam before moving on to the next part. 3.The major area of study must be within the College of Education A minimum of nine credits constitutes the related area. The courses can be taken in any department of the university with the approval of the student's committee. The related area must be specically planned with the major and minor departments in order for the doctoral elds to be mutually supportive. Any transfer credit or predoctoral course work to be included in the related eld must have the approval of both the major and minor department at the outset. Specied course work in both research and statistics is required for this degree. Other requirements are described in the departmental sections of this catalog. Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Students holding a Bachelor's degree in Nursing are required to complete and pass all required course work for the DNP program, as well as, complete and pass their comprehensive examination. Since a dissertation is not required, they are expected to complete an internship experience and a project paper as dened by their program. They can embark on the project paper once they have completed and passed their comprehensive examination. They are not required to take 700 level dissertation hours. However, they are expected to complete at least 12 credits at the 600 level including NURS 698 (Advanced Clinical immersion) credits sufcient to complete the DNP Final Project.32 The NMSU System Academic Regulations Students who hold a Master's of Science in Nursing are required to complete the following: 1.All course work requirements 2.Their comprehensive exam (with passing marks) 3.The DNP Project. Post- MSN DNP students must complete at least 6 credits at the 600 level, including NURS 698 credits sufcient to nish the DNP Project. Finalized projects must be uploaded to a national DNP Project repository approved by the Graduate Faculty of the School of Nursing in order to achieve the DNP degree. Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) The Doctor of Philosophy degree requires distinguished attainment in both scholarship and original research. The doctoral degree requires signicant scholarly study beyond the master's that is tailored to the needs and interests of the student. The degree is granted in recognition of the candidate's high attainments and ability in the special eld, shown by work on the required examinations covering both the general and the special elds. The individualized program of study is designed to meet the campus residency requirement, includes a minimum of 30 graduate credits, and includes the preparation of a dissertation. A candidate for the Ph.D. degree is expected to maintain a higher level of work than the grade-point average of 3.0, plus at least 18 credits of dissertation work (700-level courses). Interdisciplinary Doctorate Students interested in pursuing an Interdisciplinary Doctorate (IDOC) degree program must meet with the Graduate School for advisement. The advisement session will include information on completing the IDOC admission application. The following requirements for admission to the interdisciplinary doctorate degree program are: 1.Students wishing to study in the interdisciplinary doctoral degree program must apply and be accepted into a doctorate-granting department. 2.A master's degree or equivalent program of study that includes at least 30 credits of graduate course work with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0. 3.Twelve credits of graduate course work must be completed at NMSU in order to apply for admission into the interdisciplinary doctorate degree program. Additional course work is required for degree completion. 4.Evidence of outstanding academic achievement in graduate school. 5.A written description of the program concept prepared by the student consisting of: a.Areas in which competency is required b.Purposed readings and course work and how these relate to required competencies c.Objectives and an outline for thesis research d.Justication for not using an existing departmental degree program 6.Student must select an advisor from his/her department to help structure and chair a committee consisting of at least ve faculty members from the graduate faculty list who are willing to work on the interdisciplinary degree program. The committee must include at least two members from each of the two doctorate-grantingdepartments. The committee chair will convene a meeting to review and approve the proposed program. 7.The Graduate School will send an Admission Referral document, signed by all the committee members, to the heads of all the departments from which the student proposes to use more than 8 credits of course work, or from the department which the faculty are requested to serve on the proposed committee. 8.Once the Admission Referral document has been approved by all departments, the committee chair will convene a meeting of the committee to review the student's program and make changes as necessary. In addition, the committee will set the format and date for the qualifying exam. An effort should be made to incorporate the interdisciplinary nature of the program into the qualifying exam. 9.Students have satised the requirements for admission to the program once the qualifying exam has been passed and the respective department heads approve the Admission Referral memorandum. Formal acceptance into a doctoral program may be required in order to receive nancial assistance. 10. The number of courses required for degree completion will vary depending on the student's program of study, please see the department for more specic requirements. However, Interdisciplinary doctorate degree students must meet the requirements for residency, registration, the comprehensive examination, the Final Examination, the dissertation and the declaration of approved minor. 11. The dissertation work shall include at least 18 credits of a 700-level course. Completing your Doctoral Degree Program Any student who fails to abide by the regulations in this section will be considered withdrawn from the university. In order to resume their studies, the student must formally apply for readmission to the Graduate School and satisfy any requirements that are in effect at the time of reapplication. Declaration of Approved Minor Any doctoral applicant for candidacy may declare up to two approved minors in addition to the major area of study. Demonstration of competency in the minor area will be required at both comprehensive and nal examinations. Qualifying Examination Doctoral students must pass a qualifying examination that is scheduled by the student's advisor and is administered by the major department. Its purpose is to determine the areas in which the student shows strength or weakness, as well as the ability to assimilate subject matter presented at the graduate level. A student may not register for dissertation credits prior to the successful completion of the qualifying examination. The following conditions apply to students who wish to take the qualifying examination: 1.For students who enter the Graduate School with little or no previous graduate experience but wish to proceed directly to the doctorate, the qualifying examination should be taken after 12 credits of graduate work 2.For students who enter with a master's degree or equivalent from another university, or another department, the qualifying examination should be taken before the completion of one semester of graduate work. 3.For students who earn their master's degree at New Mexico State University and will continue in the same department, the departmentNew Mexico State University - Alamogordo 33 may allow the master's nal examination to serve as the doctoral qualifying examination or may require a separate examination. Based on the result of the qualifying examination, the department will take one or more of the following actions: 1.Admit the student to further work toward the doctorate 2.Recommend that the program be limited to the master's degree 3.Recommend a re-evaluation of the student's progress after the lapse of one semester 4.Recommend a discontinuation of graduate work In all cases, the Graduate School shall be notied by the department of the results of the qualifying examination. Students will be admitted to the doctoral program once the qualifying examination is passed. The student's advisor and department head will then appoint the doctoral committee to prepare the student's preliminary doctorate program of study. The student must submit the program of study to the Graduate School immediately following admission into the doctoral program and before registering for additional coursework. Doctoral Graduate Committee The doctoral committee will be composed of at least four members of the graduate faculty who hold doctoral degrees. The following rules apply to the composition of the committee: The committee chair must be from a discipline within the student's major area. At least one additional member of the committee must also be from a discipline within the student's major area. If an approved minor is declared, at least one (but no more than two) members of the committee must be from the minor area. At least three committee members must be members of the graduate faculty and be from a doctorate-granting department Only one member may be outside of the student's department. One member of the committee must serve as the dean's representative. In programs where more than one department participates, the dean's representative may not be from any of those departments. The dean's representative may be one of the following the member from the related area a member from the minor area An independent member, not from the student's department, that is appointed by the Dean of the Graduate School. Departments may structure committees that include more than the minimum number of members, as long as the following conditions are satised. No changes can be made to the doctoral committee membership without prior approval from the Dean of the Graduate School. Additional voting and nonvoting members may be any person approved or appointed by the Dean of the Graduate School All members of the committee will attend the comprehensive oral and nal defense for the student's dissertation. Program of Study Students should le the Program of Study Form once they have: Completed 12 graduate credits while at NMSU that are beyond the master's degreeSuccessfully completed the qualifying examination The Program of Study Form should be completed and submitted to the Graduate School before registering for any additional courses. The individualized program of study is designed to meet the campus residency requirement and includes a minimum of 30 graduate credits beyond the master's. If the Doctoral degree requires a dissertation, at least 18 credits of dissertation work must be included. The professional doctoral degree includes a practicum or special project that culminates in a written report which demonstrates a command of the relevant scholarly literature and links it to the specic clinical or practical experience. Comprehensive Examination The Graduate School should receive the Program of Study and the Committee for Doctoral Students Form and the Doctoral Qualifying Examination Form. Students will be admitted to the comprehensive examination only after the following conditions are met 1.Completion of adequate course work, to the satisfaction of the major department and the Graduate School 2.The graduate committee determines the student is adequately prepared for the examination 3.Successful completion of all language requirements (where applicable) Students must be registered for 3 credits of graduate course work during the semester in which they take the comprehensive examination. A student taking an oral examination during the summer must enroll for at least one credit for that term. The Doctorate of Philosophy Examination or Professional Doctorate Examination Form must be on le at the Graduate School at least ten working days prior to the proposed date for the examination. The examination must be part written and part oral. The results of the oral examination will be reported to the Graduate School by the Dean's Representative of the committee. Any student who fails the comprehensive examination may either be terminated from the doctoral program or upon recommendation of the committee and approval of the Dean of the Graduate School, be granted a second examination after a lapse of at least one semester. NOTE: In general, there should be a time lapse of at least one year between the comprehensive and nal oral examination. However, due to the type of research required and the method of administering the written comprehensive in some departments, such a time lapse is not always practical. In all cases there must be one semester between the comprehensive and the nal oral examinations. Time Limit for the Comprehensive Examination If more than ve years have passed since the date of the comprehensive examination, the candidate will be required to take another comprehensive examination before admission to the nal examination. Advancement to Candidacy Advancement to Candidacy recognizes that the student has demonstrated the ability to sustain a level of scholarly competency commensurate with successful completion of degree requirements. Upon advancement to candidacy, the student is cleared for the nal stages of34 The NMSU System Academic Regulations the graduate program which may include a dissertation, project or written examination. For advancement to candidacy the following criteria must be met 1.Successful completion of the comprehensive examination 2.Recommendation of the graduate committee 3.Approval of the Dean of the Graduate School Upon receiving advancement to candidacy, students must establish residency and follow the Dissertation Registration Requirements (see Residency Requirements below). Residency Requirements The minimum campus residency requirements for the doctoral degree include enrollment in a minimum of 9 credit hours of program course work, including a minimum of 3 credit hours of dissertation, in at least two semesters of classes taught at NMSU. In some cases the minimum credit hour enrollment for the two semesters required to establish residency may vary based on the instructional delivery of the program, and must have prior approval from the Dean of the Graduate School. Dissertation Registration during Fall/Spring Sessions After becoming a candidate, students must continue to register for at least 3 credits of dissertation or graduate course work, each spring/ fall semester until the dissertation is approved by the Graduate School and the dissertation format review has been completed. The total number of dissertation hours must be 18 credits. The doctoral committee can impose additional requirements for courses numbered 700. A student who fails to abide by these regulations will be considered withdrawn from the university and in order to resume studies, must formally apply for readmission and satisfy the requirements in effect at the time of reapplication. Dissertation Registration during Summer Sessions If the nal examination is to be held during the summer or the dissertation is to be completed during the summer, students must register for one credit during the summer session in which the nal examination will be held or the dissertation will be completed. Dissertation Leave of Absence Students may seek a leave of absence from their dissertation. A leave of absence requires that a student must get prior approval from the Dean of the Graduate School, which means the student must receive permission for the leave of absence before discontinuing their formal studies. Final Examination NOTE: If more than ve years have elapsed since the date of the student's passed comprehensive examination, the candidate will be required to take another comprehensive examination before admission to the nal examination. Every student working toward the doctoral degree will submit a dissertation embodying the results of original research. The dissertation is expected to demonstrate the student's ability in independent investigation and to be a contribution to human knowledge. The dissertation shall display a mastery of the literature of the subject eld, present an organized and coherent development of ideas with a clear exposition of results, and provide a critique of the limits and validity of the student's conclusions. When a complete draft of the dissertation has been prepared, the student's doctoral committee (appointed after the qualifyingexamination) will conduct the nal examination. The nal examination is concerned primarily with the research work of the student as embodied in the dissertation, but it may be much broader and extend over the candidate's entire eld of study. The intention of the nal examination is to verify that the candidate has a satisfactory grasp of the major subject as a whole and has a general acquaintance with the elds of knowledge represented by the course of study. The nal examination is oral and is open to the public. The nal examination must be completed in accordance with the schedule provided in the academic calendar. Ten working days before the examination is taken the department must submit the form requesting this examination to the Graduate School. This form may be found on the Web at http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/graduate-forms/ and is also available from the Graduate School and departmental ofces. Students must ensure that each member of the examining committee receives a copy of the dissertation, no later than seven working days before the date of the nal examination. Any candidate who fails the nal oral examination may either be terminated from the doctoral program or upon recommendation of the committee and approval of the Dean of the Graduate School, be granted a second examination after a lapse of at least one semester. Failure in the second examination disqualies the candidate from obtaining the degree. Finalizing the Doctoral Dissertation After successful completion of the nal examination, a copy of the dissertation must be submitted to the Graduate School for format review no later than the deadline posted to the Graduate School website. The form and style of the dissertation must comply with the regulations given in the Guidelines for Preparing a Thesis or Dissertation http:// gradschool.nmsu.edu/theses-dissertations/. These guidelines also contain detailed information on the dissertation-approval process and binding. Candidates are encouraged to consult with the Graduate School on format, deadlines and procedures before nal typing. The dissertation is not complete until copies have been accepted for binding by the binding section staff and until the UMI agreement form and the online Library binding form has been completed and received in Branson Library. Registration at NMSU is a process that includes: (1) academic advising with a faculty or staff member, (2) registering for classes, online or with your academic advisor, and (3) paying the tuition and fee bill. For rst time freshman and transfer undergraduate students (at the Las Cruces campus), the registration process is through the Aggie Welcome/ Transfer Student Orientations. For currently enrolled Undergraduate students and all Graduate students registration is through your advisor or online through the myNMSU portal. For detailed instructions and questions about registration which are not addressed on the website, please contact the University Student Records Ofce (USRO) (https:// records.nmsu.edu) . Admission Requirement No person will be will be allowed to register for courses until formally admitted to NMSU through the Community College, International Programs, Undergraduate or Graduate Admissions processes. Course Schedule Each semester and summer session, the University Student Records Ofce provides an online course schedule which can be accessedNew Mexico State University - Alamogordo 35 through myNMSU or the NMSU website. Note that not all courses listed in this catalog are offered every semester. Registration Schedule by Classication Several groups of students (e.g. Crimson Scholars, Students with Disabilities, Veterans) receive priority dates for course registration. For other students, registration dates are determined by the student's current classication at the time of registration. A student's classication is determined by the number of credits completed, and does not include courses in progress. Freshmen have less than 29 completed credits. Sophomore rank is achieved with successful completion of 28 credits; junior rank 60 credits; senior rank 90 credits. University Credits The unit of university credit is the semester hour, which is based upon one hour of lecture class or a minimum of two hours of practice/lab per week during one semester, and assumes a minimum of two hours additional , by the student, outside of class. The number of credits associated with each course is indicated in the course schedule. Course Load for Undergraduate Students The full-time course load in a regular semester (fall or spring) for a main campus undergraduate students is 12-18 credits. A full-time course load for a summer term is 6 credits per session for a total of 12 credit hours. Some scholarships have a 15 credit course load eligibility requirement. Each student is responsible for meeting their own scholarship eligibility requirements. An overload is classied as more than 18 credits for a regular semester and more than 12 credits for the summer term. A one-credit course in physical education or supplemental instruction will not create an overload. Registration for a course overload requires written permission from the Director of the Center for Academic Advising and Student Support or the Associate Dean for Academics in the student's college. A \"Change of Schedule (https://registrar.nmsu.edu/les/2018/03/Change- of-Schedule_Updated-02-02-18-1.pdf) \" form is required and available from the University Student Records Ofce or on their website (https:// records.nmsu.edu). Freshmen and students with a grade of D or F , or a cumulative grade-point average of less than 2.5, in either of the last two semesters, are not eligible for overloads. Concurrent enrollment in non-NMSU courses at other post-secondary institutions requires prior approval from the Associate Dean for Academics in the student's college, and these courses are counted as part of a student's class load. Course Load for Graduate Students A full-time course load is 9 credits, with a maximum of 15 graded credits for a regular semester (fall or spring) and a maximum of 9 graded credits for the summer session. Course Numbering The course numbering system at NMSU indicates the level of the course as follows: Undergraduate courses are assigned numbers 100-499. Courses numbered 100-299 are referred to as \"lower-division courses\" and are primarily for Freshman and Sophomore level students. Courses numbered 300-499 are referred to as \"upper-division courses\" and are primarily for Junior and Senior level students.Graduate courses are assigned numbers 500 or greater. Courses numbered 500-599 are primarily for graduate students working on a master's degree. Courses numbered 600-700 are primarily for students working on a doctoral degree. Some graduate programs may accept courses numbered 450-499 for graduate credit. Graduate students should conrm eligibility with their program department head. Prerequisites and Corequisites Some courses require advance or concurrently acquired specic knowledge and skills. Prerequisite(s) and corequisite(s) for each courses are indicated in the course description section of this catalog. Students must have completed (or be presently enrolled in the prerequisite(s)) courses in order to register for a course with prerequisites. Where a student was allowed to register for a course while completing the prerequisite(s), and then subsequently fails to successfully complete a prerequisite course, the student shall be dis-enrolled from the course requiring the prerequisite. In the case of a corequisite, a student must enroll in the courses during the same semester. In some instances, where a course has an enforced \"pre/corequisite\" the student can elect to either take the requirement before registering for the course, or take the courses at the same time. Registration Changes Subject to any registration \"holds\" and any applicable deadlines, students may change their course registration online. Caution should be exercised as registration changes may negatively impact eligibility for scholarships, nancial aid or athletic participation, the student's ability to progress through their degree program in a timely manner, and the student's obligations with respect to tuition and fees. The University Student Records Ofce publishes an online schedule of \"Important Dates for Students\" for each semester. The student is responsible for reviewing and adhering to the Important Dates, including the deadlines to add, drop or withdraw from course(s) for the relevant semester. Adding Courses: There are two different types of deadlines for adding courses: 1.Last day to add a class without instructor's signature - during this period courses may be added online through myNMSU, or through your academic advisor (if necessary). 2.Last day to add a class with instructor's signature - during this period courses may only be added with \"Change of Schedule (https://registrar.nmsu.edu/les/2018/03/Change-of- Schedule_Updated-02-02-18-1.pdf)\" form signed by the instructor (available online on the University Student Records Ofce website (https://records.nmsu.edu) ). * Students taking classes online and who do not live in the Las Cruces Area must email the instructor, using the NMSU email, in order to get permission to be added to the course. If the instructor approves the addition, the approved response must be sent to either the student's academic advisor or to records ()@nmsu.edu (registrar@nmsu.edu) with the student's name, ID number and course CRN number they are wanting to add. Withdrawing from Courses: There are two different types of deadlines for withdrawing from courses:36 The NMSU System Academic Regulations 1.Last day to drop without a \"W\" grade - during this period, the student can drop the course and not have it appear on their ofcial transcript in any form, and the student will have no nancial obligation related to the course (students will receive a 100% refund if tuition has been paid for the course). 2.Last day to drop with a \"W\" grade - during this period, the student can withdraw from the course, but the course will appear on their ofcial transcript with the withdrawal (W) designation as the grade, and the student will be responsible for the full tuition and fees related to that course. Students are responsible for initiating ofcial withdrawal from any course(s) they do not intend to complete. Students who experience extraordinary circumstances that prevent timely registration changes should consult with their Academic Associate Dean or the Registrar. For more information about the process for adding or withdrawing from a course(s), please speak with your academic advisor or contact the University Student Records Ofce. Any student attending under Veteran Educational Assistance must notify the Military and Veteran's Programs ofce before processing registration changes to determine if changes will affect their enrollment status or benets. A student found insufciently prepared for a course they are enrolled in may be transferred to a more elementary course in the same subject any day before the last day to withdraw from an individual course. Waitlisting Waitlisting is available for all courses across the NMSU system, except for labs that are linked to a specic lecture class. Waitlisting is an electronic list of students who are waiting to register for a lled course. Once students are put onto the waitlist, the process to get into that course is as follows: 1.A currently enrolled student must drop the course for a seat to become available. 2.The rst student on the waitlist is notied through their NMSU email. 3.The notied student has 24 hours to login to their myNMSU and register themselves for the class. 4.If the rst student fails to register within their allotted 24 hours, then the rst student is dropped from the waitlist and the next student on the waitlist is notied. This continues until the empty seat is lled. A student who fails to register for the class during their allotted 24 hours is automatically dropped from the waitlist and can add themselves back onto the bottom of the waitlist for that course. Students cannot be added to the waitlist after the rst day of classes. Instructor overrides can only be made after the second day of class, at which point the instructor's signature is required on the \"Change of Schedule Form (https://registrar.nmsu.edu/les/2018/03/Change-of- Schedule_Updated-02-02-18-1.pdf) \" to add a course. Graduate Registration Requirements for Summer Students who have scheduled their nal examination, or who are completing their thesis during a summer session, must be registered for one credit hour during the same summer session. In order to graduateduring a summer session, the student must have led the Application for Degree by the deadline posted on the Academic Calendar. Repeating Courses for A Change in Grade See the Grading portion of the Academic Regulations section of this catalog. Substitutions and Waivers Students registering for their nal semester must have all course substitutions and waivers of required, for their degrees, courses approved before the last day of registration, during the semester in which the student expects to obtain the degree. Auditing a Course (No Credit) An audited course is one in which the student registers for the learning experience but does not seek to earn academic credit for the course. A student seeking to audit a course must register and pay tuition and fees for the course and have the consent of the instructor to take the class in audit form. A student who has registered to audit a course may be dis-enrolled from the course at any time before the registration deadline expires if necessary to accommodate a student taking the course for credit. After the last day to register, the student cannot change the course option from audit course to a for credit bearing course. Audited courses are not used in determining a maximum class load (overload) for undergraduate students in good academic standing, however, the audited course will be counted as part of the maximum allowable course load for graduate students and undergraduate students who are on academic probation. Attendance and Student Performance Academic success is closely correlated to student participation and attendance. Accordingly, students are expected to regularly attend all their classes. Each course instructor will establish the specic attendance and course requirements. Only students who are currently enrolled in a course for either credit or audit are permitted to ofcially attend the classes. However, individual instructors may allow an occasional visitor and may allow a student who ofcially withdrew from the course to continue to attend for the remainder of the semester. Absences from Class and Failure to Complete Assignments Students who must miss class due to accident or illness, or due to other circumstances beyond their control should consult the course syllabus and the instructor for guidance. Students may be administratively dis- enrolled from a course due to excessive absences (consecutive absences in excess of the number of class meetings held within a week or any number of absences which are impairing the student's performance), or for persistent failure to complete assignments. In such cases, the Instructor may recommend administrative dis-enrollment by providing a completed \"Student Absence/Lack of Progress Report\" form to the Academic Associate Dean. If the Academic Associate Dean agrees with the recommendation of the course instructor, the student will be dis-enrolled from the course. A dis-enrollment has the same effect as a voluntary withdrawal (see \"Registration Changes\" in this catalog). Any student who has been administratively dis-enrolled from a class may appeal that decision to the Dean of the College where the course was offered within 10 days after notication of the dis-enrollment.New Mexico State University - Alamogordo 37 Any absences due to the student's participation in a university sponsored event (e.g. ASNMSU president representing NMSU at legislative session, student athletes competing in NMSU scheduled athletic events, or students attending educational eld trips and conferences) will be excused and deemed an \"Authorized Absence\". Authorized absences do not relieve the student of the course assignments or responsibilities and instructors may require students to complete course work before the absence. Prior to the student's absence, the sponsoring department will provide the instructor with written notice of the dates of expected absence. Classroom Conduct Each instructor has the authority to establish and enforce reasonable rules of conduct in their courses. A student who engages in behavior that interferes with the educational environment of the class may be administratively dis-enrolled with the approval of the academic department head and academic associate dean for the course, and with notication to the Provost. Any student who has been administratively dis-enrolled from a class may appeal that decision to the Dean of the College where the course was offered within 10 days after notication of the dis-enrollment. Student Performance Assessment Individual student performance and learning outcomes in a course are measured and evaluated by the course instructor and reported to the student in the form of grades. Each instructor has the authority to establish assignments and other assessments (such as exams and quizzes) and to assign grades based on the student's performance on those assessments. Final grades for the course are determined by the instructor and reported to the University Registrar as described in grading section of this catalog. Any student who believes that their academic performance has been evaluated unfairly may appeal the grade through the University's Academic Appeals process as provided in this Catalog. Academic Program Assessment New Mexico State University is committed to providing its students with a quality education and a supportive learning environment. Academic Program Assessment is a continuous improvement process achieved by identifying a program's desired learning outcomes, evaluating the extent to which those outcomes are collectively achieved by students in the program, and then implementing changes to enhance and improve the collective program outcomes. For assessment to be effective, students must be actively aware of and engaged in assessment activities. Academic Program Assessment requires participation of students who are expected to provide feedback on personal, professional and academic development and to participate in a variety of assessment exercises. Assessment activities may be a part of regular graded course assignments, or may require students to engage in other activities. Assessments may include course projects, exams, exit interviews, standardized tests, surveys, focus groups, etc. Data gathered through these assessments is published only in aggregate form. Learn more about NMSU's Academic Program Assessment at https:// assessment.nmsu.edu/ Exam Week and Final Examinations NMSU designates the last week of each semester as \"Exam Week\" during which each course has only a single 2 hour meeting time for a mandatory culminating activity which may be a nal examination or some other course related activity. The University Student RecordsOfce (USRO) establishes the Final Examination Schedule for each semester (http://registrar.nmsu.edu/nal-examination-schedule/). Examinations are typically held in the course's usual lecture/lab room. Some departments hold Departmental Exams where all students for all sections of a particular course are required to take the nal examination simultaneously. The date, time and location of the Departmental Exams are indicated on the Final Examination Schedule. For courses that were not scheduled to meet at the specic times listed under \"Regular Class Time\" on the USRO's Final Examination Schedule, the instructor and course department coordinate examination dates, times and locations with NMSU's Academic Scheduling ofce (575) 646-4790. Final exams for weekend courses are held at the regular class period on the last day of class. The nal exam or culminating activity must not be rescheduled for a different date, time or location, except with permission of the department head and the unanimous consent of the enrolled students. During the week before Exam Week, instructors are not allowed to hold examinations lasting more than one class period. Any student having more than three examinations scheduled in any one day may, no later than the week prior to exam week, notify the instructor of the examination scheduled latest in the day to obtain an alternative date for that examination. (If the fourth exam is a departmental exam, the instructor of the third exam will make alternate arrangements for that exam upon request.) Students who believe that their instructor(s) have not honored Exam Week requirements may appeal to the instructor's department head. Developmental Evaluation The academic skill level of all entering rst-time students at the time of registration is evaluated based upon ACT scores, SAT test scores, and if available, the NMSU Math Placement Exam score. The student's eligibility to enroll in university level English and Mathematics courses is dependent upon this evaluation. Any new student may choose to take the MPE to test towards a higher math placement than indicated by the ACT and high school graduation scores. All new engineering students must take the MPE. More information on the MPE is available from the Department of Mathematics website. https://www.math.nmsu.edu/ msc/MPE/overview.html. Students who have not demonstrated adequate preparation for university level courses are required to take developmental courses. Developmental courses are included on the transcript and will be included in the calculation of the GPA, but the developmental course credits do not count towards a degree. Developmental Courses in English - Students who score below 15 on the ACT English exam will be placed into appropriate developmental English course or course(s) (prex CCDE) before enrolling in ENGL 111G (http://nmsu.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2016-2017/Undergraduate-Catalog/ Courses/ENGL-ENGLISH/100/ENGL-111G) . Students who score below 13 on the ACT English will require two developmental courses before enrolling in ENGL 111G (http://nmsu.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2016-2017/ Undergraduate-Catalog/Courses/ENGL-ENGLISH/100/ENGL-111G) . Developmental Courses in Math - Students who score below 23 on the ACT mathematics exam, and who did not achieve a qualifying score on the NMSU Math Placement Exam (MPE), will be placed into the appropriate development mathematics course or courses (prex CCDM). Placement into CCDM course(s) is dependent upon the student's ACT score and high school GPA. Students are not allowed to enroll in any other math courses at NMSU until successfully completing any requisite CCDM course(s). (As an alternative to the math developmental course(s),38 The NMSU System Academic Regulations students may complete AS 103 with a C- or better, which does earn credit toward a degree.) Basic Academic Skills All undergraduate students must demonstrate Basic Academic Skills in both English and mathematics before enrolling in any upper-division course (numbered 300 or higher). These requirements ensure that each student in the upper-division courses has the ability to succeed without compromising the learning experience of other students. The completion of the Basic Academic Skills requirements does not necessarily result in the award of academic credit nor satisfaction of university general education requirements in English and mathematics. (Students should consult the General Education Courses and Requirements section in this chapter for these requirements.) Transfer students with 45 or more credits are allowed to enroll in upper- division courses for only one semester before satisfying the Basic Academic Skills requirements. The Basic Academic Skills requirements may be satised in a variety of different ways as listed below: English Basic Skill Demonstration Options (achieve one of the following): ACT English Score of 30 Coursework - ENGL 111G , or equivalent, completed with a grade of C- or higher. Equivalents: the following are deemed equivalents to ENGL 111G for the purpose of satisfying Basic Academic Skills in English: ENGL 111GH - completed with a grade of C- or higher ENGL 111 M - required for International students who took the TOEFL examination CLEP Exam score of 57 or higher in freshman college composition English Advanced Placement (AP) Exam score of 3, 4, or 5 English Composition Transfer Credits - 3 or more credits with a grade of C- or above, transferred from accredited post- secondary institutions (International students may be required to take ENGL 111 M as noted above.) Credits from Non-accredited Institutions - As a general rule, NMSU does not accept credits from non-accredited institutions. Students with 3 or more credits of college-level English composition with a grade of C- or higher from a non-accredited institution may, however, challenge the Basic Academic Skills requirement in English and English 111G course requirement by submitting a theme paper written under the supervision of, and demonstrating achievement of English 111G learning outcomes as determined by, the Department of English. Mathematics Basic Skill Demonstration Options (achieve one of the following): ACT Mathematics Score of 23 Coursework - any one of the following courses or course combinations completed with a grade of C- or higher in each course: MATH 111 and MATH 112G Any mathematics course numbered 120 or above (prex MATH) Any one statistics course: A ST 251G , STAT 251G or STAT 271G Basic Skills Exam Passing Score - offered twice a semester by the Department of Mathematical SciencesCalculus AB, Calculus BC or Statistics Advanced Placement (AP) Exam score of 3, 4, or 5 IMPORTANT NOTE: Basic Academic Skills Demonstration fulllment options may not appear on the transcript, result in the award of academic credit, or satisfy general education requirements. The Basic Academic Skills requirements are used solely for the purpose of determining eligibility for enrollment in upper-division courses. All students should seek to complete the Basic Academic Skills requirements as early in their academic program as possible. Students who postpone completion of Basic Academic Skills may be unable to progress toward degree completion in a timely manner. Independent Study and Directed Reading Courses Independent study courses and directed reading (other than those designated in the catalog with a subtitle), are for students capable of and sufciently motivated to undertake self-directed study with limited oversight of a faculty member. Only students who have completed at least 28 credits at NMSU under traditional grading, with a cumulative GPA of 2.5 or better, are eligible to enroll independent study courses. No student is entitled to enroll in independent study and enrollment requires the consent of an instructor who agrees to supervise and evaluate the student's learning activities in the course. Students seeking enrollment in an independent study course should prepare an independent study proposal to present to individual faculty member(s) in the relevant discipline for consideration. At a minimum, the proposal should include the topic of study, a brief survey of the literature or other resources on the topic, and a description of the proposed written product or other tangible outcome of the independent study. The relevant academic department for the discipline may have additional requirements. Each college determines the maximum number of credits that may be earned in independent study courses. Adjusted Credit Option The adjusted credit option provides eligible undergraduate students who earned a low grade-point average (less than 2.0 cumulative) during their rst few semesters to reset their GPA calculation. This option may be used only once and is not reversible. These are the consequences of exercising the Adjusted Credit Option: 1.All of the student's academic history pre-dating the request, including all NMSU course credits previously attempted or completed, transfer coursework, CLEP , ACT , advanced placement, special examination, and/or military service are included in the adjustment and designated as \"ADJUSTED CREDITS\" on the transcript. These credits are no longer be included in the calculation of the cumulative grade point average. 2.Courses carrying an academic grade of S, CR, C- or better, earned prior to the grading period in which the student requested this option, are treated as earned academic credit and need not be repeated, except where a higher grade is required in the student's academic program. 3.Courses carrying an academic grade of U, CD, D or F , earned prior to the grading period in which the student requested this option, remain on the student's transcript, but no academic credit is provided for these courses. The student must repeat these courses to obtain academic credit. 4.The student's academic transcripts will continue to reflect all coursework, including courses falling under the adjusted creditNew Mexico State University - Alamogordo 39 option. In no circumstances will a transcript be issued that does not include all courses attempted at this university. 5.The student's current academic status, eligibility for employment, and nancial aid may be impacted. Probationary status and eligibility for on-campus employment are not affected by the exercise of the adjusted credit option. 6.The repeat rule for courses starts anew. 7.The student will not be eligible for award of an associate degree until earning thirty (30) or more additional credits after exercise of the Option. 8.The student is eligible for University honors at graduation upon completing a minimum of 60 academic credits at NMSU, after the adjusted credit option is exercised, with a resulting grade point average which satises University regulations for honors. After carefully considering the consequences indicated above, eligible students may exercise the Adjusted Credit Option by paying a fee of $10 and submitting an adjusted credit option application to the University Student Records Ofce. Application forms are available on the University Student Records Ofce website and can be approved by the Director of the Center for Academic Advising and Student Support or the Associate Dean for Academics in the student's college or the Academic Vice President at the Community Colleges. Only students meeting the following criteria are eligible to exercise the Option: 1.No awarded baccalaureate degree 2.Enrolled as a degree-seeking or non-degree undergraduate student 3.Cumulative grade-point average of less than 2.0 at NMSU 4.Fewer than 60 credits accumulated (including both transfer and NMSU credits) Credit by College Level Examination Program (CLEP) Prior to or during a student's enrollment at NMSU, credits may be earned through the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) of the College Entrance Examination Board. CLEP is a national program of credit by examination that offers the opportunity to earn credits for college level achievement wherever or however the student learned. Earned CLEP credit will be treated as transfer credit without a grade, will count toward graduation, and may be used in fullling specic curriculum requirements. A current NMSU CLEP policy as well as test schedule information is available through Testing Services DACC East Mesa, RM 210. Testing Services may be reached at: (575) 528-7294. Credit by Examination Any enrolled student with a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 currently attending classes may, with permission of the appropriate department, challenge by examination any undergraduate course in which credit has not been previously earned except an independent study, research or reading course, or any foreign language course that precedes the nal course in the lower-division sequence. The manner of administering the examination and granting permission shall be determined by the department in which the course is being challenged. Students may not enroll in a single course, challenge it by examination, and drop it during the drop/add period, unless they enroll in an additional course. In exceptional cases in which a student demonstrates outstanding ability in a course in which he is already registered, he may be permitted to challenge the course. A student desiring to apply for special examination may obtain the necessary forms from the University Student RecordsOfce. The fee for challenging a course is the same as the approved tuition rate. Courses may not be challenged under the S/U option. The special examination privilege is based on the principle that the student, exclusively, has the responsibility for preparing for a special examination. Credit for Military Service New Mexico State University will award academic credit to United States military personnel for courses and Military Occupational Specialties (MOS), based on the American Council of Education Guide (ACE) as well as through national standardized tests, such as CLEP , AP , PEP and DANTES. Credit for military-training is in accordance with NMSU Faculty Senate Legislation Proposition 24-07/08, which was passed in May 2008. Military Training and Military Occupational Specialties (MOS) must have a recommendation evaluation by ACE (in the ACE Guide) for credit to be awarded. Courses accepted for transfer credit become part of the student's ofcial NMSU transcript and academic record. If a student wishes to appeal a decision regarding the acceptance of military training/ education and/or MOS for academic credit, the student must submit a written statement of appeal to the Dean of the College to which the student has applied. The Dean will review the merits of the appeal and render a decision. The decision of the Dean is nal. Only Primary MOS (s) are eligible for academic credit in the initial review and evaluation. Credit for Duty and/or Secondary MOS may be eligible for academic credit if the student petitions the college's Associate Dean. Primary MOS is the primary specialty of a soldier and reflects the broadest and most in-depth scope of military experience. Veterans, active-duty personnel, National Guard and Reservists who are current students or students applying for admission to New Mexico State University may be granted academic credit on a case-by-case basis upon evaluation of military transcripts - the Joint Service Transcript (jst.doded.mil) and the Community College of the Air Force transcripts. Course equivalencies and credit hours awarded for a particular NMSU degree are determined by colleges and/or academic departments. Credit hours may be awarded for specic courses toward degree requirement, or as elective credit. The number of credit hours awarded will be determined by the college and/or academic department. NOTE: Students submitting military transcripts for credit evaluation must keep in mind the Maximum Time Frame policy. See Financial Aid (https:// catalogs.nmsu.edu/nmsu/general-information/nancial-aid-scholarship- services) Section. Graduate Course Deciencies Students who have been admitted with departmental deciencies may be required to take diagnostics tests and additional qualifying examinations. They must complete satisfactorily, in a manner specied by the major department, all undergraduate course deciencies as prescribed by the department responsible for the graduate program. Courses taken to satisfy deciencies will be listed on the undergraduate transcript; however, these course grades will not be calculated in the student's graduate GPA or graduate hours. With the permission of the student's advisor and the head of department, courses to meet undergraduate deciencies may be taken under an S/U option (with S being a grade satisfactory to the professor), and such courses will not affect the maximum number of S/U graduate credits permitted. Short Courses for Graduate Students Short course(s) that are numbered 450 and above have been approved to carry graduate credit. Graduate students must be registered for the short course(s) to receive graduate credit. Concurrent enrollment of graduate40 The NMSU System Academic Regulations students in regular and short courses for the fall/spring semesters is allowed, provided the combined total credits does not exceed 15. All short courses carrying one semester credit will be graded on an S/U basis and these credits will be counted toward the student's limit of S/U credits. Challenging Graduate Courses A graduate student may challenge a graduate course by examination, please see the Graduate School for more information. University Grading System Each course department or instructor establishes the system for assessing student performance in achieving course learning objectives. Students should consult the course syllabus for a description of the grading system used in each course. At the conclusion of each course, instructors are required to report a nal grade reflecting the instructor's assessment of each student's performance. Shortly after the end of the term, students can access their grades through the MyNMSU portal. No other grade notication will be issued. The nal grade is reported on the student transcript. Instructors may elect whether to use fractional grading (the use of the plus and minus) in assigning nal letter grades. The NMSU system for nal grades is expressed in letters, which carry grade points that are used in calculating the cumulative grade-point average, as shown in this table: Letter Grade Grade Points per Unit of Credit A+ 4.0 A 4.0 A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B 3.0 B- 2.7 C+ 2.3 C 2.0 C- 2.0 D+, D, D- 1.0 F 0 W- Withdrawal 0 N- Grade not submitted 0 CR- Credit authorized, but not letter grade0 IP- In progress 0 RR- Progress in undergraduate course0 PR- Progress in graduate thesis 0 S- Satisfactory work10 U- Unsatisfactory work 0 I- Incomplete work 0 AU- Audit 0 1S grades are grades that are satisfactory to the professor and are normally equivalent to the letter grade of C- or higher. Any courses for which only CR, S or PR is awarded, but no traditional letter grade is given, will be included in the total number of earned hours but is not computed in the grade-point average. Traditional letter grades are those which are used in the grade point average determination: A+,A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D- and F . In computing the overall grade- point-average, the total credits in which grades of A+ through F have been assigned is divided into the total number of grade points earned. Midterm and Six-Week Early Performance Grades A Six-Week Early Performance Grade (sometimes referred to as Midterm Grade) for courses numbered 100-299 will be posted and available to students through the MyNMSU portal. The purpose of the early grade posting is to ensure that students have an opportunity to address any performance issues. Students should be mindful that the Six-Week Early Performance Grade reflects a students' performance on only that portion of the total coursework that has been graded at that time. Any student who is doing poorly, or not as well as they would like, should meet with the instructor to discuss how they can improve. Students who have concerns about their progress in multiple courses or who are considering withdrawal from course(s) must meet with their academic advisor. In courses numbered 300 or higher, the posting of Early Performance Grades is optional and may occur through the online course management system rather than the MyNMSU portal. However, prior to the last day to withdraw from a course, upon request, instructors will provide information to students about their progress in the course. Retention of Grading Records Individual assignments and exams that are not returned to students should be retained by the instructor or department through the end of the subsequent regular semester. The records used to compute individual nal grades should be retained for two years after the completion of a course. If a nal grade is appealed, these records are kept for at least two years after the completion of the appeal. Departments, colleges or the library may require that records be kept for longer periods. Minimum Grade Requirement for Undergraduate Students Undergraduate degrees require a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher for degree completion. Although D+, D, or D- can be considered passing, some departments have higher grade requirements for the courses within their program and/or their program as a whole. Students should check with their departments regarding specic course grading requirements for their particular degree program. Minimum Grade Requirement for Graduate Students Graduate degrees require a cumulative graduate G.P .A. of 3.0 or higher. Although B- and C grades (including C+ and C-) earned at NMSU may be counted toward the requirements for a graduate degree in some programs, this grade does not reflect acceptable graduate-level performance and may cause the cumulative G.P .A. to fall below the 3.0 required for graduate students. Some departments have higher grading requirements for courses in their programs. Students should check with their departments regarding specic course grading requirements for their particular degree program. Courses in which a student earns a D or F grade do not ever satisfy graduate degree requirements; however these grades will be calculated in determining the students' cumulative grade-point average. To obtainNew Mexico State University - Alamogordo 41 academic credit, students must retake courses in which a grade of D or F was earned. S/U Grading S/U grading allows the student to attempt to earn course credit without having a course grade included in their grade point average calculations. Under S/U grading, the instructor assigns an S grade for satisfactory achievement of the course learning objectives (normally equivalent to the letter grade of C- or higher) and a U grade for unsatisfactory performance in the class. Designated S/U Courses Each academic college may designate courses in which the grading will be on a basis of S or U for all students enrolled in the courses. Credits in designated S/U courses are not included in the limitations on the number of S/U credits a student may take, and are not subject to the student eligibility requirements described below. Election of the S/U Grading Option - Undergraduate Students In courses other than those designated as S/U for all students, eligible individual students may elect the S/U Grading Option, subject to the regulations stated below. To be eligible for the S/U (satisfactory/ unsatisfactory) Grading Option, undergraduate students must meet the eligibility requirements and obtain approval of an academic advisor. Eligibility requires completion of 28 credits at NMSU under traditional grading, with an overall average of 2.5 or better. (Upon approval of the adjusted credit option, students must re-establish eligibility.) Non- degree seeking students may take courses under the S/U option without regard to eligibility requirements. However, these courses may not be subsequently applied toward an undergraduate degree at NMSU. The S/U option must be elected as part of the course registration and may not be added once the course registration period closes. Other than honors courses and courses ofcially designed as S/U, the following limitations apply to courses in which the S/U option is elected: 1.No more than 7 credits per semester or 4 credits per summer session. 2.Not to exceed a total of 21 credits towards a degree. 3.Not a required course for the student's major. Students electing the S/U option should be mindful that upon a change of majors, the new major department may require a traditional grade for a course within that major that was previously completed with an S grade. In such cases, the student may request that the original instructor process a change of grade form to apply a traditional grade, however, if more than 2 years have elapsed or if the instructor is no longer at NMSU, such a change will not be possible and the student may be required to retake the course or obtain a traditional grade through a course challenge. Election of the S/U Grading Option Election - Graduate Students With an approval from their advisor and department head, graduate students in good academic standing may elect the S/U option, at the time of registration, for courses taken outside the major department, subject to the regulations stated below: 1.No more than a total of 6 credits of elected S/U courses are permitted in the master's degree. 2.Doctoral candidates may take an additional 6 credits under the S/U option after application to candidacy.I Grade Designation The letter grade of I (incomplete) is given for passable work that could not be completed due to circumstances beyond the student's control that develop after the last day to withdraw from the course. In no case is an I grade to be used to avoid the assigning of D, F , U or RR grades for marginal or failing work. Examples of appropriate circumstances include documented illness, documented death or crisis in the student's immediate family, unexpected military deployment and similar circumstances. Other job related circumstances are generally not appropriate grounds for assigning an I grade. Students requesting an I grade are responsible for providing satisfactory evidence of such circumstances. (In the case of medical records, instructors should review the information provided, note that adequate medical documentation was provided for review, and return the documentation to the student. Under no circumstances should the instructor retain any medical records or indicate the specics of any medical condition in the academic records.) The refusal to grant an I grade may be appealed in the same manner as any other nal grade. To assign an I grade, the instructor must complete the \"I grade Information Form\" and have the form delivered to the associate dean of the course college. The instructor must indicate on the form whether the student will be given the option to complete the remaining coursework and have the I grade changed to the earned letter grade. If so, the instructor should indicate the steps necessary to complete the remaining coursework. The I grade form should either be signed by the student in person, or the associate dean must send a copy of the document to the student's ofcial permanent address, as recorded in the University Student Records Ofce, with a notation on the form that the student was not available for signature. The I grade will be permanent in instances where (1) the instructor did not provide an option to complete the coursework, (2) the instructor left NMSU prior to completion of the coursework and grade change, or (3) the student failed to complete the coursework by the relevant deadline, and the instructor did not indicate that the I grade would be changed to the earned grade upon failure to complete. In such instances, the student will be required to re-enroll in the course to receive credit (in which case the permanent I grade and the subsequent earned letter grade will both appear on the transcript). The student is entitled to have the I grade removed from the transcript only if, within 12 months or any earlier deadline established by the instructor on the \"I Grade Information Form\" and prior to graduation, the student completes the remaining coursework, as specied on the Form, in a manner satisfactory to the instructor. If the student fails to complete the coursework, the instructor may change the I grade to any appropriate grade (including D, F or U) only if the instructor stated that this would occur on the \"I Grade Information Form. \" The instructor should assign whatever grade was earned for the entire course. To change the I grade, the instructor must complete a \"Change of Grade Form, \" obtain the signature of the associate dean for the course, and submit the form to the University Student Records Ofce. RR Grade The RR grade may be assigned only in undergraduate developmental courses (CCDE, CCDL, CCDM & CCDR) and indicates that the student has made substantial progress toward completing the requirements of the course. It carries neither penalty nor credit, so a student must re-enroll and successfully complete the course in order to earn credit. The grade42 The NMSU System Academic Regulations of RR may be received only once in any given course, and is a permanent notation on the student's transcript. W Grade Designation The W grade is assigned only in courses when the student withdraws or is administratively dis-enrolled from the course after the last day to drop the course. The W grade is permanent. Effect of Change of Grade The effect of a change of grade on a student's academic standing (scholastic warning, probation or suspension) depends on the date the transaction is ofcially recorded on the student's academic record. If the transaction is recorded before the student begins another semester, the grade change (such as replacing the I grade with an earned grade) is included in the grade-point average calculation in order to establish the student's academic standing. If the transaction is recorded after the student begins another semester, for the purpose of calculating academic standing, the new grade is included with any other grades earned for the semester in which the grade change is processed. Repeating Courses for a Change in Grade Undergraduate students: may repeat courses, for a change in grade, when the original grade earned was a D or F . Once a grade of C- or better is earned, the course will then be substituted in the calculation of the grade-point-average and students will no longer be able to repeat that course for change of grade purposes. Student transcripts will continue to show the grade awarded for each course attempt. If the student's original grade was a D and he/she repeats the course, but receives a F , the second grade will not be substituted for the original. Repeat options apply only to eligible courses that were completed prior to the time a student was awarded a degree at NMSU. Graduate students: may repeat courses to achieve a higher grade, but the grade assigned for each attempt will remain on the transcript and will be counted in the grade point average calculation. Grade Point Average Grade point average (GPA) calculations are based solely on courses taken at NMSU or under an approved National Student Exchange. Grading in Graduate Research In grading both master's and doctoral research, thesis and dissertation work in progress, the instructor reports for each enrollment period the grade PR (progress) or U (unsatisfactory) rather than a traditional letter grade. These assigned grades are permanent notations on the student's transcript. Only those credits graded PR (Progress) accumulate toward the minimum number of research credits required. PR indicates that the student has devoted an adequate amount of time to the work scheduled but does not indicate the quality. U indicates that the student has stopped work or is doing work of unacceptable quality. At the conclusion of the nal oral examination, or when the thesis/ dissertation is submitted for the nal signature of the graduate dean, the instructor will report the nal S or U grade for that semester. If the thesis/ dissertation and the performance in the nal oral examination are found to be acceptable, the instructor will report an S (satisfactory) grade. If the thesis/dissertation or the performance in the nal oral examination is found to be unacceptable, the instructor will report an U (unsatisfactory) grade.If a student accumulates a total of two U (unsatisfactory) grades in courses numbered either 598, 599, 600, 699 or 700, the student will be placed on provisional status. If three U (unsatisfactory) grades are reported for these courses, the student will be dismissed from the Graduate School. . Withdrawal from a Single Course Any student wishing to formally withdraw from a single course, after the last day to drop has passed, can do so through their Academic Advisor or the University Student Records Ofce. All such withdrawals will be registered on the student's transcript with the \"W\" grade indication. For students wishing to withdrawal from all courses, please see the section on Withdrawal from NMSU. Leave of Absence from the Graduate School Students who are working on advanced degrees and plan to have an interruption in studies, for a calendar year, should request for a leave of absence through their department head. The student must submit a formal letter through their department head to the Dean of the Graduate School, an email will not be accepted. The request should include the beginning date and the anticipated ending date for the period of absence. A graduate student on leave of absence will be expected not to use university facilities and place no demands upon the university faculty and staff, and, therefore will pay no fees. Time spent in the \"leave-of- absences\" status will not be counted toward the advanced degree time limits. A graduate student who fails to register for one calendar year without obtaining a leave of absence from the Graduate School will be considered withdrawn from the university, by the Graduate School. In order to resume their studies after such absences, the student must go through the formal readmission process. Administrative Withdrawals An administrative withdrawal is initiated for a student who is representing the university at an ofcial out-of-town event and becomes effective when the student returns from the event or ve class days after the signed drop slip gets to the dean's ofce. Military Withdrawal New Mexico State University understands that our military and Veteran students may be called to active duty, specialized training, or disaster relief efforts with little notice. U.S. active duty military students wishing to withdraw from all their classes must present their orders and their request for full withdrawal, as indicated below. However, the below policy does not pertain to a student's basic and/or annual training. A student who has an order for training is encouraged to formally request, through the proper military chain of command, a postponement of their orders until the summer or the end of the semester they are currently enrolled in. If a student's request for postponement is denied, the student may then follow the below steps but must provide documentation that their postponement request was formally denied. All NMSU students that have been called up for active duty must take the following steps in order to withdraw from all their classes:New Mexico State University - Alamogordo 43 1.Military and Veterans Programs (MVP) : VA students ordered to Active Duty must provide a copy of orders to the MVP ofce, in Corbett Center Student Union, Room 244. To assist in reporting accurate information to the VA Regional Ofce, student should also provide, in writing, last day of class attendance. 2.NMSU Registrar: All students presenting their orders to the University Student Records Ofce, (575) 646-3411, will receive a military withdrawal from classes and a full tuition and fees refund for that semester. 3.Bookstore : Students who still have their receipts for textbooks purchased the semester in which they are called to active duty will be given a full refund for these textbook purchases when they present their orders. (575) 646-4431. Student Medical Withdrawal A student medical withdrawal applies to a student who becomes seriously ill, injured or hospitalized and is therefore unable to complete an academic term for which they are enrolled. This action applies to all courses a student is registered for in the affected semester(s). The student cannot select which courses they want to withdraw from and which they want to remain registered for when exercising this option. The students' attending physician must provide a letter, on ofcial letterhead with an original signature, stating the date(s) within the semester that the student was under medical care and must withdraw because of that medical condition. This letter must be submitted within the semester or no later than one academic year after the end of the term for which the withdrawal is being requested. Once the information is reviewed a nal determination will be made if the student is eligible for the consideration of tuition or other refunds (students receiving funds awarded by the University Financial Aid and Scholarship Services should be aware of policies regarding withdrawal from the University). At the Las Cruces campus, medical withdrawal begins and ends at the University Student Records Ofce. At all other campuses, medical withdrawal begins at the Student Services Ofce but is ultimately nalized with the University Student Records Ofce on the Las Cruces campus. Medical Conditions of a Family Member Withdrawal A student who is withdrawing because of a medical condition of an immediate family member must submit a letter from the family member's attending physician.This action applies to all courses a student is registered for in the affected semester(s). The student cannot select which courses they want to withdraw from and which they want to remain registered for when exercising this option. It must be on ofcial letterhead with an original signature, stating the date(s) within the semester that the student's immediate family member was under medical care and that the student must withdraw to attend to the immediate family member's medical condition. This letter must be submitted within the semester or no later than one academic year at the end of the term for which the withdrawal is being requested. Immediate family member, in this instance, includes a spouse; a domestic partner, as dened in the NMSU Policy Manual 7.04; a child, parent or legal guardian; a sister or brother and a grandparents or a grandchild. Familial relationships that are created by law are also included (i.e. mother/father in law; half or step siblings); any other relationships can be considered on a case-by-case basis.Once the information is reviewed a nal determination will be made if the student is eligible for consideration of tuition or other refunds (Students receiving funds awarded by the University Financial Aid and Scholarship Services should be aware of policies regarding withdrawal from the University.) At the Las Cruces campus, medical withdrawal begins at the University Student Records Ofce. At all other campuses, medical withdrawal begins at the Student Services Ofce. Withdrawal from NMSU Withdrawal from any NMSU campus is an ofcial procedure that must be: 1.Initiated by the student (using the Withdrawal form) 2.Have all necessary signatures (as indicated on the form) 3.Be approved and processed through the Registering Ofce, located on the Las Cruces Campus Students who withdraw from all courses for the semester should do so in person through the University Student Records Ofce. However, students who are unable to come in person may submit an e-mail using their NMSU e-mail account to records@nmsu.edu (). Students who leave without following the ofcial procedure are graded appropriately by the instructor. Applicable dates for the last day to withdrawal are published on the approved university academic calendar or under important dates at: http://registration.nmsu.edu. A student who withdraws from all classes for the semester will retain access to their NMSU account per current policy but will lose access to other services and privileges available to enrolled students. Financial information concerning drops and withdrawals can be found at http://uar.nmsu.edu/withdrawals/. Financial Aid Recipients should contact University Financial Aid and Scholarship Services before withdrawing. Students receiving funds awarded by the University Financial Aid and Scholarship Services should be aware of policies regarding withdrawal from the University. The Federal Higher Education Act requires the University to calculate a Return of Federal Student Aid Funds for students who withdraw (ofcially or unofcially) from all classes on or before the 60 percent attendance point in the semester. Using a pro-rata schedule, the percentage of the semester attended is used to calculate the amount of the student's earned versus unearned Federal student aid funds. The unearned portion of Federal student aid funds will be returned to the appropriate aid program(s). Students withdrawing from classes are responsible for payment of any balance due after the required return of Federal student aid funds. Graduation Requirements For specic graduation requirements for any degree offered at NMSU please see the Degrees, Majors, Minors and Other Academic Programs of Study (http://catalogs.nmsu.edu/nmsu/regulations-policies/ #academicprogramsofstudytext) section, as well as the departmental sections for those requirements. These requirements will include the minimum GPA, total credits and specic course requirements for graduation. Applying for a Degree Any students that are in their nal semester of classes are considered degree candidates and are required to submit an \"Application for Degree\" as well as pay graduation fees for each degree being sought. The44 The NMSU System Academic Regulations application for Degree form is available online through the MyNMSU website. It must be completed and submitted by the designated deadline for that semester. The fees for the Las Cruces campus are all listed in the Tuition, Fees and other Expenses (http://catalogs.nmsu.edu/ nmsu/essential-information-students/tuition-fees-other-expenses) section of the catalog, once a student submits the application the fee will be included in the total cost for the semester or session in which the candidate anticipates completing their degree requirements. If degree requirements are not completed during the semester/ session the student originally applied for, the student must then reapply and pay the appropriate fees. A $25 late fee applies to applications received after the application deadline, and no applications will be accepted after the posted deadline date. A student must specify which catalog they are using for their degree requirements in order for the university to determine if the requirements are met and if a degree can be certied. The latest date for substitution or waiver of required courses for degree candidates is two weeks after the last date of registration for regular or summer terms. Attendance at the Commencement Ceremony Commencement is a symbolic ceremony. Participation in commencement does not, in itself, mean that a student is considered an NMSU graduate. In order to be awarded a degree, a student must fulll university requirements as determined by academic colleges. The degree will reflect the graduation date from the application for degree in which all degree requirements were determined by the academic colleges. The academic colleges will conrm the students eligibility to participate in the commencement ceremony that is held at the close of the fall and spring semesters. Eligible candidates who are in the process of completing their nal degree requirements and degree recipients from the previous summer session will participate in the fall ceremony. Students who are in the process of completing their nal degree requirements in the spring must attend the spring ceremony. However, Bachelor degree candidates that wish to participate in a spring commencement, prior to completing degree requirements in summer school may do so if they meet the following conditions: 1.Receive permission the Dean of their college 2.Show a minimum cumulative grade-point average of 2.0 3.Only need 12 or fewer credit hours to complete their degree requirements 4.These remaining credit hours must be offered in the upcoming summer schedule of classes 5.Submit a degree application and approved petition form (available in the Dean's ofce) by the last day to apply for a degree in the spring semester. Academic Regalia Each college may approve distinctive symbols to be worn by the top 10 percent of its graduates at commencement. Only one symbol may be worn by each graduate. In addition, the student with the highest honors in each college may wear a crimson- colored gown. No other symbolic additions to academic regalia are allowed without the approval of the Academic Deans Council.Diploma All fees and bills owed the university must be paid in full before a student may receive a diploma or ofcial transcripts. The degree title and major(s) will be printed on the diplomas, in accordance to the degree application award, determined by the academic colleges. Academic honors will also be printed on the diplomas below the degree and major(s). The name on the diploma will reflect the student's current ofcial NMSU records. Name changes are only processed for currently admitted students. Diplomas will be mailed to graduates approximately eight weeks after the individual colleges certify the degree requirements and the nal grades have been processed by the University Student Records Ofce. The diploma will be mailed to the address specied on the degree application, unless an address change was requested before the last day of the semester. Undergraduate Academic Standing When a student does not maintain adequate academic standing, he/ she is placed in Academic Warning. If the student's academic standing does not improve, the placement progresses to Academic Probation I. Continued unimproved academic standing moves a student into Academic Probation II, then nally, Academic Suspension. Each stage imposes more structure and limitations on the student in order to help them return to normal academic standing. The intent is not to punish, but to help the student return to normal academic standing and success. Since some of these limitations involve limitations on the number of credit hours, students on Probation or Suspension may be subject to loss of nancial aid. It is the responsibility of the student to determine the impact of their changed academic standing on their nancial aid. Notication to students of academic warning, probation, or suspension appears on the student's grade report at the end of each grading period. Undergraduate Academic Warning Issued only once, the rst time a student's cumulative GPA falls below a 2.0 while in good academic standing. The relevant Associate Dean for Academics or Campus Academic Ofcer (CAO) will send the student a letter detailing the consequences should the cumulative grade point remain below a 2.0 at the conclusion of the semester. A student on Academic Warning remains eligible for all extracurricular activities as governed by the rules of the specic activity. While under Academic Warning the following restrictions apply: 1.The student may be required to enroll in a 3-credit hour special study skills/time management course specically designed for students on Academic Warning, or an equivalent course approved by the appropriate associate dean or CAO of their campus. 2.Students will be required to enter into a contract with their advisor, approved by their department head that places further stipulations on Academic Warning. The contract may include, but is not limited to the following: 3.The student may be required to take at least one repeat course to try to improve their GPA. 4.Except for the special study skills/time management course, the student's coursework may be restricted to their major. 5.The student may be required to get tutoring help. 6.The student may be required to see an academic counselor on a specied time schedule.New Mexico State University - Alamogordo 45 7.The number of credit hours a student may register for may be restricted (due to extenuating circumstances such as the student's workload commitments). The associate dean or CAO may place the student on Academic Probation I should the student not adhere to the stipulations of the contract. If the student's semester GPA is less than a 2.0, and the cumulative GPA remains below a 2.0 at the end of the semester on Academic Warning, the student is placed on Academic Probation I. If the semester GPA is greater than 2.0 but the cumulative GPA is still less than 2.0, the student will remain on Academic Warning. If the cumulative GPA is greater than a 2.0 at the end of the semester then the student is returned to good academic standing. Undergraduate Academic Probation I This occurs when a student under Academic Warning has a semester GPA less than 2.0, and the cumulative GPA remains below 2.0 at the conclusion of the semester or if the student maintains a semester GPA greater than 2.0 while on Academic Probation I but the cumulative GPA is still less than 2.0. Under Academic Probation I the following conditions apply: 1.The student cannot enroll in more than 13 hours of coursework during the semester. Note: Students falling below 12 credits in any one semester will jeopardize their nancial aid. Should this occur, students should see the associate dean in their college as soon as possible to try to implement corrective measures. 2.The student will enter into a contract or individualized education plan with their advisor and approved by the associate dean or CAO that place further stipulations on Academic Probation I. The associate dean or CAO may place the student on Academic Probation II or Academic Suspension should the student not adhere to the stipulations of the contract. 3.Students on Academic Probation receiving educational benets from the Veterans' Administration must obtain counseling from the Military & Veterans Programs Ofce. 4.Students admitted under special provisions whose transcripts indicate less than a 2.0 GPA are admitted on Academic Probation I. The student must maintain a semester GPA equal to or greater than 2.0 until such time that the cumulative GPA is greater than 2.0 at which time the student goes back to good academic standing. Until the transition happens the student remains on Academic Probation I. The student will be placed on Academic Probation II if he/she is unable to maintain a 2.0 semester GPA, and the cumulative remains below a 2.0 GPA, while under Academic Probation I. A student on Academic Probation I remains eligible for all extracurricular activities as governed by the rules of the specic activity. Undergraduate Academic Probation II Academic Probation II is issued in two ways. The rst is when a student falls below a semester 2.0 GPA and the cumulative GPA remains below a 2.0 while on Academic Probation I. The second is when a student maintains a semester GPA greater than 2.0 while on Academic Probation II but the cumulative GPA is still less than 2.0.The following restrictions are in place for student's in Academic Probation II: 1.The student cannot enroll in more than 7 credit hours of coursework during the semester. 2.As with rule 2 under Academic Warning and Academic Probation I and at the discretion of the associate dean or CAO, the student will be required to enter into a contract with their advisor, approved by the associate dean or CAO, to place further stipulations on Academic Probation II. The associate dean or CAO may place the student on Academic Suspension should the student not adhere to the stipulations of the contract. The student must maintain a semester 2.0 GPA or higher until the cumulative GPA reaches a 2.0 or higher at which time they are placed on good academic standing. A student unable to maintain a semester GPA of 2.0 or higher, and the cumulative remains below 2.0 GPA, while under Probation II will be placed on Academic Suspension. A student on Academic Probation II remains eligible for all extracurricular activities as governed by the rules of the specic activity. Continuing in Probationary Status Students may continue to enroll while on Academic Probation I or II provided they maintain a semester GPA of 2.0 or higher. If they withdraw from the university while on Academic Probation, they continue on that same level of Academic Probation. Removal of Academic Probation Such academic standing is removed when the cumulative GPA is raised to 2.0 or higher, with the following exceptions: 1.a transfer student may not remove probation by summer work alone; 2.if an I grade is removed after the student has enrolled, the new grade's effect on academic standing is based on its inclusion with grades for the term for which the student is enrolled; 3.exercise of the Adjusted Credit Option does not change academic status until subsequent grades are earned. Academic Suspension When a student does not achieve a semester 2.0 GPA or higher, and the cumulative remains below a 2.0 while under Academic Probation II, they are placed on Academic Suspension. Students under Academic Suspension are not allowed to take NMSU courses while under suspension. Students on Academic Suspension must sit out a minimum of 1 semester and then petition the Provost or designee to be removed from Academic Suspension. At this time the suspension status will be evaluated for possible removal. Should the suspension be lifted, the student is placed on Academic Probation II until such time as the cumulative GPA equals or exceeds a 2.0. At the discretion of the Provost or designee, the student will enter into a contract approved by the Provost or designee and the student's Dean or CAO, setting stipulations to have the suspension removed. Failure to adhere to the contract will return the student to Academic Suspension. Under certain conditions, a student may be re-admitted at NMSU under regular status while under Academic Suspension when satisfactory progress has been demonstrated at another college or university (see Readmission- Degree Seeking). Credits earned at another university or college while under Academic Suspension from NMSU or another university or college will be accepted at NMSU only after the student46 The NMSU System Academic Regulations demonstrates satisfactory progress over a period of two semesters after being re-admitted or admitted to NMSU. Acceptance of transfer credits that count toward degree requirements is still governed by the rules established by the student's respective college or campus. Rescinding Academic Suspension for Summer Attendance A student may use summer classes to try to get warning or probationary status removed. Students suspended at the close of the spring semester may have their Academic Suspension rescinded if they attend summer session at NMSU or one of its Community College colleges. Such attendance must raise the combined spring semester and summer GPA to 2.0 or better. Under no circumstances may a student on Academic Warning or Academic Probation be allowed to register for an overload. Academic Warning status is continued if the student withdraws from the university and the probation or suspension status applies to all subsequent enrollments. A certication of eligibility to attend summer sessions at NMSU after a spring semester Academic Suspension is available to the suspended student who wishes to attend summer sessions at other institutions. Graduate Academic Probation and Suspension Graduate Academic Standing is based on both the student's semester GPA and cumulative GPA. The student must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher to remain on Graduate Academic Good Standing. Graduate Academic Probation I : A graduate student is placed on Graduate Academic Probation I when a graduate student's semester GPA is above a 3.0 and the cumulative GPA drops below 3.0; or when the semester and cumulative GPA's drop below 3.0 and the previous academic standing is Graduate Academic Good Standing. Graduate Academic Probation II : Is issued when a graduate student semester GPA and the cumulative GPA drops below as 3.0 and the previous academic standing is one of Graduate Academic Probation I or Graduate Re-admit on Probation I. Graduate Academic Suspension : If the graduate student is unable to maintain a semester GPA of 3.0 or higher and the cumulative remains below 3.0 GPA while under Graduate Academic Probation II, the student will then be placed on Graduate Academic Suspension. Students on Graduate Academic Suspension are barred from enrolling in graduate level courses at NMSU while on Suspension. Graduate students on Graduate Academic Suspension must sit out a minimum of one semester. Graduate students on suspension who wish to continue Graduate School after suspension must re-apply to the department and Graduate School. The student must also petition College Academic Dean or the Graduate School Dean, based on the major and degree the student is pursuing to be removed from Graduate Academic Suspension. At this time the graduate academic suspension status will be evaluated for possible readmission to the department. Should the suspension be lifted, the graduate student is placed on Graduate Academic Probation II or Graduate Re-admit on Probation II until such time that the graduate cumulative GPA equals or exceeds 3.0. If you have questions about your academic standing, please contact your department academic advisor or Graduate Dean's ofce.Student Academic Code of Conduct The Student Academic Code of Conduct (SACC), applicable to both undergraduate and graduate students, provides procedures for the review and resolution of alleged or suspected academic misconduct within a reasonably prompt time frame. The full SACC is found in the university's published Administrative Rules and Procedures (ARP), specically ARP 5.10 and ARP 5.11. While it is important to refer to the detailed governing rules in the ARP , the process is summarized as follows: An institution-wide Academic Conduct Ofcer is responsible for processing each case of alleged academic misconduct. The accused student is provided notice of the allegation and has the right to participate during the fact nding process. The student may contest the investigative ndings or sanction before a neutral third party hearing panel member. Either party to the matter has the right to a nal appeal of the ndings or a Level II sanction to the Ofce of the Provost. The SACC distinguishes between Level I Sanctions and Level II sanctions, depending upon the severity of the offense and other factors. The Level 1 sanction includes a formal warning. Offenses by graduate students and repeat offenses, even if less serious are subject to a Level II Sanction. Level II sanctions include a notation of academic misconduct on the student's academic transcript. The full policy, examples of academic misconduct, report form and a flowchart of the procedures for resolving alleged student academic misconduct is available at: Policies ARP 5-10 (https://arp.nmsu.edu/5-10) ARP 5-11 (https://arp.nmsu.edu/5-11) Examples of Academic Misconduct and ARP (Examples) (https://arp.nmsu.edu/wp-content/ uploads/sites/26/2018/01/Appendix-5-10-A.pdf) ARP Appendix 5.11-A (https://arp.nmsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/ sites/26/2018/01/Appendix-5-11-A.pdf) Privacy Rights The following information has been designated as directory information and is subject to release to the public under the Buckley Amendment (PL 98-380), \"The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974: \" student's name, class level, college and major, dates of attendance, degree(s) earned, honors and awards, address, telephone number, NMSU email address, Aggie ID number, most recent previous educational institution attended, place of birth, and some information about students involved in recognized activities and sports.

Social Work - Associate Degree The Associate degree in Social Work is designed to prepare students for careers in social service or community health agencies as paraprofessionals. In addition, because of the large New Mexico Common Core component, the degree also helps prepare the student for a successful transition into a bachelor's program in Social Work or other majors. The bachelor degree requirement for a second language requires a grade of C or better through the 112 level in any second language. If the student is a native speaker, the requirement is met with 113, 213 and 214 sequence in the language. If the student has taken one or two years of a second language in high school, they should take the language placement test to determine the level of course in which they should begin. See an advisor. Students interested in the Las Cruces campus Bachelor Degree in Social Work program may also be interested in the Associate in Social Work. Students planning to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Social Work must apply for the Social Work Program. Students (particularly transfer students) should contact the Social Work Advisor in Las Cruces for advising and for the application packets.
