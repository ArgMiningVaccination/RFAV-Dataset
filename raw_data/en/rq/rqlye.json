Heat and light in particular have a destabilizing effect on the molecular structures, which is why the vaccines usually have to be stored in a dark and cool place. For most vaccines, a storage temperature of +2 \u00b0C (+36 \u00b0F) to +8 \u00b0C (+46 \u00b0F) is mandatory. Temperatures that are either too cold or too warm can damage vaccines and impair their effectiveness. Therefore, the storage temperature should always be controlled. The new mRNA vaccines must sometimes be stored at a temperature of -20 \u00b0C (-4 \u00b0F) or and how do they work? The acronym mRNA stands for messenger ribonucleic acid. The idea of using mRNA in vaccines is new. In contrast to other vaccines, it is not an attenuated or killed pathogen that is injected but a part of the genetic information of the virus in the form of mRNA. Using copies of DNA segments, the body normally generates mRNA itself to form proteins. The body cells of the vaccinated person form antigens from the information in the mRNA, which activate the human immune system. In the process, the mRNA does not enter the cell nucleus and therefore cannot change the DNA of the vaccinated person. After a relatively short time, mRNA is degraded by the body, but the body's vaccination response remains intact. On contact with the pathogen, the immune system of a vaccinated person is then already prepared and can protect itself against disease. Laboratory appliances from Liebherr cool vaccines reliably and safely Special safety and hygiene regulations must be observed when storing vaccines that require refrigeration: - Protect them from light and heat - Ensure that the cold chain is maintained and avoid temperature fluctuations - Check the temperature - Prevent frosting or freezing - Ensure that there is proper air circulation between the vaccines To help you comply with these regulations, Liebherr offers a wide range of [Laboratory appliances](/en/usa/ncsa/commercial/research-and-laboratory/overview-laboratory-and-pharmacy.html) for cooling and storing highly sensitive substances that meet these requirements. The majority of vaccines currently available can be divided into three categories in terms of their storage temperature requirements, and Liebherr offers the right solution for each: - \u00b0F) +16 \u00b0C (+61 \u00b0F): Laboratory refrigerators Would you like more information about our products?

Liebherr ultra-low temperature freezers meet the highest safety requirements Liebherr's ultra-low temperature freezers permit ultra-low temperature refrigeration in a temperature range from -40 \u00b0C (-40 \u00b0F) to -86 \u00b0C (-123 \u00b0F). They use the best safety mechanisms and the latest technology for low energy consumption: - Minimal temperature fluctuations The units exhibit the least temperature fluctuation over a given time and within a given space. - Extensive monitoring system Liebherr units have alarm signals if there are deviations in internal temperatures. They also have extensive temperature and alarm recording options for periods in which the door was open or the power failed. These features reliably protect vaccines and samples. - Low energy consumption Liebherr ultra-low temperature freezers are among the most efficient models on the market worldwide. Their high-efficiency insulating vacuum panels and efficient cooling system enable the best possible energy savings and low operating costs. Information on the storage of the Covid-19 vaccine from BioNTech and Pfizer The new mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 is stored optimal for long-term storage in laboratories. However, BioNTech has already announced that the vaccine will be delivered in dry ice boxes and can be cooled in these boxes for 30 days. In vaccination centers and medical practices, the vaccine can be stored for up to five days in professional refrigerators at 2 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F) to 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F). Why do the new mRNA vaccines have to be refrigerated at such cold temperatures? Some of the new mRNA vaccines are more sensitive to heat than other vaccines. Special lipids surround the mRNA. The lipids ensure that the mRNA gets to where it needs to go in the body. Strong cooling causes these lipids and lipid structures to stop moving, thus keeping the structure stable. At temperatures of -70 \u00b0C (-94 \u00b0F), this state can be guaranteed long term. Therefore, some mRNA vaccines are stored at ultra-low temperatures. Vaccine storage at -20 \u00b0C (-4 \u00b0F) The American company Moderna has announced that its vaccine preparation mRNA-1273 can be stored long term at -20 \u00b0C (-4 \u00b0F). At normal refrigerator temperatures, it is expected that the vaccine can be stored for 30 days. So, different vaccines require very specific storage conditions. The [Laboratory freezers](/en/usa/ncsa/commercial/research-and-laboratory/general-purpose-freezer/general-purpose-freezer.html) from Liebherr are up to these challenges and can be adapted to individual temperature and safety requirements. Liebherr offers a wide range of laboratory freezers that can even be adjusted from -9 \u00b0C (+16 \u00b0F) to -45 \u00b0C (-49 \u00b0F), depending on the application. The precise electronic controllers as well as integrated alarm systems ensure storage at a temperature that is accurate to the degree. Most vaccines are stored at +2 \u00b0C and +8 \u00b0C (+46 \u00b0F), even long term. However, even here, special safety standards apply regarding the temperature. Many vaccines must not be allowed to freeze. A sharp drop or rise in temperature can damage vaccines. Another important point is the cold chain: For live vaccines, it is important to ensure uninterrupted refrigeration between +2 also have to be refrigerated, the cold chain can be interrupted, for example, for short-term transport.
