Due prior to the start of SY20 -21, t he continuous education plan application asked LEAs to enumerate the ways in which they planned to foster a safe learning environment and rigorous educational content during the public health emergency - regardless of the format in which instruction is delivered. Following submission, staff from both OSSE and the DC Public Charter School Board (PCSB) with related content knowledge conducted two intensive rounds of review on each question, assessing responses for completion, clarity, and compliance. Throughout the process, LEAs were given feedback and the opport unity to revise their plans. Following final approval, each LEA posted their plan publicly. OSSE is publishing this selection of sample responses to ensure that stakeholders across the education landscape can better understand the approaches that LEAs are taking toward continuous education during this unprecedented time and to provide LEAs the chance to understand what their colleagues have planned . The responses contained he rein are a sample of the strong responses that met completion, clarity, and quality requirements and are intended to serve as a helpful reference for their peers. 4 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Cleaning NOTE : OSSE did not provide formal comments to public charter LEAs for these questions. Question(s) 1. Describe LEA's plan to keep building clean. a. What is the cleaning schedule? For example, what happens weekly, daily, and multiple times per day? b. How you will ensure buildings are clean if/when an individual in a school communit y tests positive for COVID -19 (e.g., work with an outside vendor specializing in deep cleaning or train in -house janitorial staff to ensure cleaning standards are met)? Sample Responses LEA A and LEA B submitted detailed plans that compli ed with OSSE Heal th and Safety Guidelines ; the m easures taken by these LEAs to promote and ensure physical distancing were extensiv e. In particular, LEA A outlined a comprehensive daily schedule that not only detailed the timetables by which certain cleaning and/or disin fecting tasks a re to be completed, but also provided information breaking down the frequency by which common objects within the school were to be treated to reduce the likelihood of viral transmission and a clear protocol for addressing potential COVID cas es within the school community . LEA B 's response was mindful of the ways in which staff must be sensitive of the impact of cleaning products on young children and provided information on how the LEA will balance the need to clean and disinfect the building while also ensuring the safety of it s learners. The LEA also laid out a plan for maintaining a sanitary environment in response to a positive COVID diagnosis. LEA Detail LEA Name LEA Response LEA A (LEA also submitted a table explaining the frequency of cleanings for high -touch areas.) Cleaning schedule for the contracted custodians regularly employed to LEA A ; Daily 6:00am -6:30pm: One custodian and one security guard are assigned to each floor in the building. Custodians are responsible to clean, disinfect and sanitize hig h touch areas in classrooms and common areas multiple times per day and as needed. Teachers and Aides will wipe down and sanitize the student desks in their own classrooms two times per day and more as needed. 5 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Security is responsible to sanitize (wipe or s pray with disinfectant) high touch areas in common areas multiple times per day and as needed. Nightly 8:00pm -12:00am Contracted cleaning company will clean, disinfect and sanitize entire b uilding each night. Nightly Two Times Per Week: Contracted cleaning company will deep clean all classrooms and common areas two times per week every Wednesday and Friday. Cleaning, Sanitization, and Disinfection of Affected Spaces (Confirmed COVID -19 Case) Exposure Reporting, Notification, and Disinfecting To ensure a clear and efficient process for communication, the school has identified the school nurse as the internal COVID -19 point of contact (POC). This person is responsible for ensuring the below steps are followed in the event of a confirmed case of COVID -19. She will also act as the point of contact for families and staff to notify if a child or staff member test p ositive for COVID -19. Step 1: Report to DC Health Department In the event the school identifies a student or a staff member who has tested COVID -19 positive, the school nurse will notify DC Health (DC Health guidelines) by emailing coronavirus@dc.gov with the following information; \"COVID -19 Consult\" in the email subject line Name and direct phone number of the point of contact for DC Health to return the call Short summary of the incident or situation Step 2: Communication to Families and Staff The scho ol's communication protocols that protect the privacy of individuals and alert their families and staff to a COVID -19 case, will be enacted. Communication will include: Notification to all staff and families in the event of change of school schedule, Noti fication to those staff and families of students in close contact with the individual and will state the requirement to quarantine for 14 days; and Notification to the all stakeholders that there was a COVID -19 positive case and that hose impacted have been told to quarantine, and all areas that the individual was in contact with will be cleaned, sanitized, and disinfected. 6 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Notification to parents wi ll be made through robo calls, mass emails and group texts messages to the school and parent body. Information will also be posted on the school's website. Step 3: Cleaning, Sanitization, and Disinfection of Affected Spaces In the event of a confirmed COV ID-19 case of a student or staff member, the school will follow all steps outlined by DC Health and CDC guidelines for cleaning, disinfecting and sanitizing. If seven days or fewer have passed since the person who is sick used the facility, the school will follow these steps: o Close off areas used by the person who is sick. o Open outside doors to increase air circulation in the areas, when possible. o Wait up to 24 hours or as long as possible before cleaning or disinfecting to allow respiratory droplets to settle. o Clean and disinfect all areas used by the person who is sick, such as classrooms, bathrooms, and common areas. If more than seven days have passed since the person who is sick used the facility, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary. The school will continue routine cleaning and disinfecting. LEA B LEA B will have equipment and procedures in place to clean and filter the air throughout the building. LEA B will follow these steps: Our janitorial day team will routinely clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched. This includes cl eaning objects/surfaces not ordinarily cleaned daily (e.g., doorknobs, light switches, classroom sink handles, countertops). Our staff will thoroughly clean and disinfect thermometers before and after each use per manufacturer's instructions. For all cle aning, sanitizing, and disinfecting products, we will follow the manufacturer's instructions for concentration, application method, contact time, and drying time before use by a child. See CDC's guidance for safe and correct application of disinfectants . Additionally, we will communicate regularly with our janitorial team to ensure they are following instructions. Cleaning providers will place signage in every classroom reminding staff of cleaning protocols. Last spring when COVID hit, we developed and implemented a schedule for increased, routine cleaning, disinfection and sanitization. This schedule will remain in effect throughout the school year while we fight the spread of COVID -19. We will limit the use of shared objects (e.g., gym or physical education equipment, art supplies, toys, games). Toys and materials will be frequently cleaned and sanitized throughout the day. 7 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Toys that have been in childr en's mouths or soiled by bodily secretions must be immediately set aside. These toys will be cleaned and sanitized by a staff member wearing gloves before being used by another child. Machine washable toys should be used by only one child and laundered in between uses. All our students' mats/cots and bedding are individually labeled and stored. Playground structures will be included as part of routine cleaning (as defined in District guidance on cleaning and disinfecting ), especially high -touch surfaces (e.g., handlebars), but do not need to be disinfected. See USE OF SPACES - COMMUNAL USE SPACE or remove if playground is closed. We will strongly recommend that bathrooms will be used by specific groups of students and staff and we will assign and share these groups with staff and teachers. LEA B and our janitorial team will safely and correctly store cleaning and disin fection products. LEA B staff will ensure that there is adequate ventilation when using cleaning products to prevent children or themselves from inhaling toxic fumes. Positive COVID -19 Case Cleaning Schedule In the event of a positive COVID -19 case in our community, LEA B will control spread by disinfecting all exposed materials and limit personnel from entering the contaminated area(s). No individual(s) will be allowed in the potentially contaminated area(s) directly following identification of a known positive case without gloves and masks and other PPE, as deemed necessary. We will ask our janitorial crew to conduct thorough cleaning and disinfecting. Additionally, we will place UVC portable units within th at space for several hours to thoroughly clean the air. Specifically, here is our deep cleaning plan: 1. Cleaning is the removal of germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. Cleaning does not kill germs, but by removing them it lowers their numbers and th e risk of spreading infection. When cleaning we will use a disinfectant. 2. Disinfecting is our staff spraying on all surfaces the National Chemical Laboratories Dual Blend #19 Lavender Disinfectant to kill germs on surfaces. This process does not necessaril y clean dirty surfaces or remove germs, but by killing germs on a surface after cleaning it, it further lowers the risk of spreading infection. We spray the National Chemical Laboratories Dual Blend #19 Lavender Disinfectant on the surface and then allow t he proper dwell time for the disinfectant agents to do the job and kill viruses, bacteria, etc. 3. Light Disinfectant Spray. On soft surfaces and hard to reach and/or packed surfaces in offices, storage spaces, classrooms, libraries, etc. our staff, during t he disinfection process will lightly spray these areas with disinfectant. 8 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov 4. Light Wipe. After the National Chemical Laboratories Dual Blend #19 Lavender Disinfectant has dwelled and done its job, we then do a light wiping of the surface to remove any excess residue. All areas listed below shall have all available hard surfaces thoroughly disinfected. This includes, but is not limited to: o Doors (both glass and solid wood) o Hard surface floors will be swept and mopped o All walls (up to 6' in height) o Carpeted areas will be sprayed with disinfectant as we clean the rooms and vacuumed. o Tables and chairs throughout o Administrative/Staff Areas o Entrance doorways inside and outside of doors o Cleaning of student cubbies o Empty cubbies will be cleaned inside and out. Cubbies with contents inside will be disinfectant light sprayed on the inside and sanitized cleaned on the outside o Teachers' desks o Student desktops and other learning spaces o Bookshelves (with books remaining on the shelves) o Storage cubbies o Waste and recycling receptacles o Window sills that are cleared to reach with open space o All restrooms will be sanitized and cleaned throughout the facility, this shall include all tiled walls, partitions, and floor surfaces, sinks, toilets, and urinals. Classrooms Throughout the School The classrooms are inclusive of specialty rooms such as science labs, art rooms, music rooms, etc. Administrative/Staff Areas Additionally, other areas listed below shall have all available hard surfaces thoroughly disinfected: Reception Area Offices Faculty Room Nurse Room Conference Rooms 9 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Physical Changes to the Environment NOTE : OSSE did not provide formal comments to public charter LEAs for these questions. Question(s) 2. Describe physical changes to the environment to ensure or promote social distancing . Sample Responses Both LEA A and LEA B submitted thorough plans that seek to maximize the amount of space between students , leverage the physical surroundings of the school building, limit contact between individuals, and reduce occupancy to curb the spread of COVID. Some of the specific tactics named include one - way flow of foot traffic in hallways and stairwells ; the assigning of seats, desks, and spaces to particular students ; staggering of transition and movement times; and limiting of shared objects. The LEAs also shared information on cleaning, disinfecting, and sanitizing schedules for high touch areas. LEA Detail LEA Name LEA Response LEA A Use of Space The school will take the following measures in its use of space: Access to the building will be limited to two entrances which are equipped with infrared cameras for checking body temperature. Temperature readings of 100.4 will result in denied access to the building . At each designated entrance, a pre- screening questionnaire will be administered as provided by OSSE's guidance. Any individual responding with \"yes\" to any question on the pre -screener, will also be denied access to the building. Marking along walkways leading to the entrances will indicate six feet apart. Arrival and dismissal will follow a staggered schedule (more details provided later in the plan) with 30 minutes intervals. This allows for smaller, more controlled groups of students entering the building at any one time. This lessens the possibility of large gatherings. Remove unnecessary furniture to create the space needed for maximum number of students, with social distancing guidelines indoor. Students will have assigned seats throughout the day, in an assigned classroom; a cohort. The upper grades will face the same direction (rather than facing each other) to reduce transmission from virus -containing droplets (e.g., from talking, coughing, sneezing). o Individual desks will all be turned to face the same direction and students will be staggered to maintain six feet distance. Students in the lower grades will sit on either end of a rectangular table, separated by the use of plastic flexible screens. 10 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov o Individual carpet shapes that will be cleaned daily, will be used during floor time. Each student will be assigned a single shape. The shapes will be six feet apart. o No more than 3 students will be assigned at a table designed for 6, and no more than 2 studen ts at tables designed for 4. All available space within the building will be maximized while observing 6 feet apart Limited number of occupants in any space based on the \"Phase\" per DC health requirement, currently maximum 12 individuals to any persons a nd an occasional 1 additional person for a brief period or as necessary to support individual student needs. The same measures will be applicable to class sessions being held outdoors. Communal -use spaces such as staff break room, library, learning pod, g eneral conference room, cafeteria, pool and the gymnasium will be closed. o Communal -use spaces which are not closed, will stagger use providing time for cleaning and disinfecting between use and maintaining six feet of distancing at all times. Playground Multi-sensory room Refrigerator, microwaves, etc. for staff Conference room for IEP meetings which could not be facilitated virtually Physical education classes will be held outside, weather permitting, and students will maintain proper distancing using vis ual cues (cones to mark the ground where students should stand). No interactive activities will be permitted (e.g. basketball, football, soccer) A designated area, with its own entry way, will be available for any student or staff who exhibit symptoms, suc h as a fever or a cough, until the individual can be safely removed from the facility. This area will be separate from the area used for routine healthcare. The area will be sanitized once it has been used by an adult or student. Pre-K student's cots will be placed head to toe during nap times. At the end of the nap schedule, cots will be sanitized daily before being stacked for next use. Blankets and sheets will be placed in student's personal bags for safe keeping and kept in personalized cubbies. Use of Hallways Hallways will include occupant traffic flow direction marking on the floor and on the walls, maintaining one -way traffic where possible and two -way traffic separated by six feet or maximum possible where space is not sufficient. Additiona l signage including decals on the floor, posters with symbols and words will be used as needed to provide direction and instruction for movement. Stairways are designated for one -way traffic flow for ascending or descending. 11 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov LEA B Use of Space LEA B will help keep individuals apart by taking the following steps: Ensure we have a minimum of six feet distance between desks, tables, and other learning spaces. Limit the number of individuals in a given space to help keep individuals 6 feet apart . For example: o No classroom will have more than 9 students and 1 or 2 adults, with classroom capacity based on total square feet. o The front lobby will have no more than 4 individuals plus the receptionist. o The l obby will have no more than 1 individual plus the receptionists. o If needed, we will create a space for 12 individuals to be on each side of the MPR. Individual work spaces will be staggered and spaced to maintain six feet distance. o Individual carpet squar es for students PK3 - K used for floor time will be cleaned daily. Each student will be assigned a single square. The squares will be six feet apart. o If sitting across from one -another at tables, students will maintain a 6 -foot distance. Many of LEA B 's communal -use spaces (such as staff break rooms and cafeteria) will be closed to group gatherings. Communal -use spaces not closed will stagger use providing time for cleaning and disinfecting between use and maintain six feet of distancing at all times. These spaces include for example: o Photocopier, cutting boards, book rooms, etc. o Playground, balls and recess equipment o Refrigerator, microwaves, etc. for staff Physical activity will be held outside, weather permitting, and students will maintain proper distancing using visual cues (e.g., mark the ground where students should stand). No interactive activities will be permitted (e.g. basketball, football, soccer). Physical barriers, such as plastic flexible screens, will be installed in some areas, like bathroom sinks and urinals, at the front lobby desk, and at the REEF reception. A designated area, with its own ventilation, will be available for any student or staff who exhibit symptoms, such as a fever or a cough, until the individual can be saf ely removed from the facility. This area will be separate from the area used for routine healthcare. Place students head to toe and 6 feet apart during nap times. The north side of LEA B 's stairwell will be used for going up the stairs and the south side of LEA B 's stairwell will be used for going down the stairs. The middle stairwell will allow individuals to go both up or down the stairs as long as no one else is on the stairs at the s ame time. Individuals must wait at the top, middle, or bottom landings to let others use the stairs so that only one person at a time is using the middle stairwell. Parents will be allowed onto campus for drop off and pick up. They must park in the neighb orhood and walk up using their designated entrance. They must wear masks and time is limited to 15 minutes or less. 12 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov LEA B 's outdoor spaces will be divided into zones, and only 12 individuals at any given time can be in that outdoor zone. LEA B 's master c alendar will outline which classes are able to use those zones and when. Use of Hallways Hallways will include occupant traffic flow direction marking on the floor, maintaining one -way traffic where possible. Maintaining 6 feet between individuals will be very important, especially in LEA B 's relatively narrow hallways. We will have floor markers 6 feet to help staff and students maintain good distance. Additionally, we will have wall art to remind students and staff to maintain 6 feet and wear masks while in the hallways. Additionally, we will monitor the hallways to ensure a minimal number of individuals are in the hallway at any given time. To foster careful transitions within the hallways, we will allow students and teachers extra time to get from one place to another. 13 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Ventilation NOTE : OSSE did not provide formal comments to public charter LEAs for these questions. Question(s) 3. What have you done to ensure adequacy of ventilation at the school? Sample Responses Given what is known about the airborne spread of the coronavirus, LEA A and LEA B have taken steps to make certain that the flow of air through their buildings is significant and frequent enough to suppress transmission . The LEAs will install more effectiv e filtration , clean their HVAC systems , and, in the case of LEA B , utilize ultraviolet light units to clean the air of viral particles. In addition, both LEAs shared plans to flush or otherwise clean the water systems in their buildings prior to reopening to eliminate the possibility that other diseases caused by stagnant water in pipes may sprea d. LEA Detail LEA Name LEA Response LEA A Ventilation We have had our outside contractor for HVAC (WL Gary) provide us with an assessment and recommendations. All filters in the building are scheduled to be replaced with MERV 14 over the next few weeks to improve air quality. The vendor will provide HVAC sy stem cleaning as needed. Water System We intend to provide bottled water to students initially. We are also seeking proposals for touchless water fountains for refilling bottles. We will use our outside vendor for plumbing to follow the guidance below to flush all water systems. We will; Flush hot and cold water through all points of use such as sinks, drinking fountains, toilets, urinals. Water heater will be set to 140 degrees Fahrenheit and hot water will be flushed at each fixture using hot water until its maximum temperature is reached. LEA B LEA B has already made a lot of investments in ventilation and plans to do more We use hospital -grade air filters in our ventilation systems. While they cost more, these special filters reduce a variety of germs contaminants and help everyone breathe easier. Our large classroom windows maximize exposure to daylight, and they open wide for great ventilation. A few years ago, we made a significant investment by adding a state -of-the-art HVAC system to ensure fresh air circulates through every classroom throughout the day. 14 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov In June 2020, LEA B engaged Setty --a highly regarded facilities consultant --to help us identify ways to further improve ventilation and air quality within our building. Based on Setty's assessment, we've taken the following steps: Purchased 10 portable UVC units, so that we can thoroughl y clear the air in a room where an ill child had been. We also plan to purchase humidifiers for each classroom to add weight to any germ / virus and sinking it to the ground. Water System Prior to reopening after any prolonged shutdown, LEA B will flush all water systems to clear out stagnant water and replace it with fresh water. This process will remove any metals (e.g., lead) that may have leached into the water and minimize risk of Legionnaires' disease and other diseases associated with water followin g CDC guidance and as described below: Flush hot and cold water through all points of use such as sinks, drinking fountains, toilets, urinals. Water heater will be se t to 140 degrees Fahrenheit and hot water will be flushed at each fixture using hot water until its maximum temperature is reached. Additional water using devices will be flushed in accordance with manufacturers' instructions. 15 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov School Operations NOTE : OSSE did not provide formal comments to public charter LEAs for these questions. Question 4. Outline the LEA 's plan for SY2020 -21 school operations to ensure all students have safe access to instruction, either in person or at home. Describe , in detail, student and staff schedules, arrival/dismissal procedures, plan for distributing educational materials, plan to ov ersee before/after care and extracurricular activities, plan to provide meals, and plan to provide personal protective equipment (PPE). Be sure to follow the public health guidance . Sample Responses LEA A and LEA B both culminated their responses regarding physical health and safety in their highly detailed submi ssions for school operations. Both LEAs promote physical distancing with extensiv e planning and consideration for how to maintain a safe and healthy learning environment during every part of the school day during times of live, face -to-face instruction . From the time students arrive for the start of the day to when the final child departs from afterschool programming and every point in between , LEA A and LEA B have paid close attention in creating processes and procedures to maintain adequate spacing, ensur e cleanliness and hygiene, and respond appropriately in cases where a positive test has been reported . LEA B also included sample instructional schedules for virtual, hybrid, and in -person instruction . LEA Detail LEA Name LEA Response LEA A (LEA also included virtual , hybrid, and in -person instructional schedules for all grades served.) Physical and Social Distancing The safety of our teachers, staff, students, and their families is our number one priority when offering on -site learning. Individu als in the facility will maintain a distance of six feet of separation between each other and have not more than the maximum number of individuals in a single room or engaging in an outdoor activity as prescribed by the Phase Guidance provided by DC Health and the Mayor's office. This means a maximum of 11 students and one instructor in any one space. An additional instructor will be permitted in that space for a very brief time. During all phases, the school will limit non -essential visitors to the building unless in cases of emergency. Travelling to and From School Students, families, and staff will be instructed to be aware of safety considerations during their travel to and from school, including walking within the community, using public transportati on, individual cars, shared cars, and school -provided transportation services. 16 1050 First St. NE , Washington, 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Walkers Students, families, and staff who walk to school will be instructed to wear masks and practice measures for minimizing exposure on their commute with the following ta ctics where possible: o Maintain six feet of distance between others on the sidewalk as much as possible, avoiding congested routes if an alternative route is reasonable and safe. o Stand back from gathering points such as intersections, where reasonable and safe, to avoid congregating in large groups. o Avoid touching unnecessary surfaces and objects. o When surfaces and objects are touched, such as crosswalk buttons, use hand sanitizer with at least the recommended percent alcohol. Riding Public Transportation Students, families, and staff who rely on public transportation to get to school will be instructed to wear masks and take proactive measures for minimizing exposure on their commute with the following tactics where possible: o Maintain six fe et of distance between others on the sidewalk and train platforms, avoiding most congested routes if reasonable and safe. o Stand back from gathering points such as intersections to avoid congregating in large groups. o Familiarize and stay current with DC Met ro Services system procedures for safety of passengers. o Avoid touching unnecessary surfaces and objects. o When surfaces and objects are touched use hand sanitizer with at least the recommended percent alcohol. o Use hand sanitizer after leaving the transit s ystem. o For the remaining distance, students will be instructed to follow the above regarding walking to school. Car Riders Students, families, and staff who are dropped off at school or who drive personal vehicles to school, will be instructed to wear masks upon exiting their vehicle while they are on the school grounds, as well as, to take proactive measures for minimizing exposure when not in their vehicle. following tactics are recommended where possible: o Maintain six feet of distance between others on the sidewalk as they walk up to the school building. o Use hand sanitizer with recommended percent alcohol after leaving the vehicle and before entering the vehicle. 17 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Entering and Exiting the Building All students, families, and staff will be prov ided instructions for entering and exiting the school. Access to the school building will be limited to two designated entrances; the Multipurpose room and the gymnasium. Two infrared high -volume temperature readers will be installed at these main entran ces with the capability of scanning, recording and identifying any individual with a reading or 100.4 (or guidelines set by the CDC). Security personnel will monitor all entrances to ensure that only designated entrances are used to access the building, en suring that ALL person's temperature is checked before proceeding into the building. Staggered arrival and dismissal times implemented to reduce peak student traffic in and out of the building. o Staggered arrival according to surname of parent/guardian on the registration documents -4 students will arrive at 9:00am. Exceptions will be made for siblings to arrive together at any of the staggered arrival time slo ts, most convenient for the parent. Pre-K 3 group will enter via the multi -purpose room, Pre -K 4 group via the gym entrance. TA's will await students and escort them to their classrooms. o Staggered Dismissal o Staggered dismissal according to surname of parent/guardian on the registration (same as arrival groups) 2:00pm -2:30pm ----Group 1 --- 2 ---Surnames N -Z Assigned staff members will be stationed at entry ways to conduct health screening of all students prior to enter ing the infrared temperature scanning zone. Staff members will complete health screenings forms at each clock -in machine, prior to clocking in for their tour of duty. Health screening checkpoints will be established, and screening questions posted on charts for quick, smooth checks and transition into the building. Mark directional lines and six -foot separation standing spots on the exterior pavement. Evaluate safety of outdoor line related to safety and security thre ats (e.g., behavioral issues, traffic). Individuals may exit the building from any of the numerous exits, identified by illuminated exit signs. Daily Health Screening 18 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Students, families, and staff are advised to check their own temperatures prior to arri ving at school each day. However, all staff, students and parents (entering only when absolutely necessary), will enter through the infrared scanning zones. A Health Screen occurs for all people entering the school. The screener will be updated per guidanc e from DC Health. The following questions will be ASKED; o Have you felt like you had a fever in the past day? o Do you have a new or worsening cough today? o Do you have any of these symptoms today? Shortness of Breath or difficulty breathing Fatigue Muscle or Body aches Headache New loss of taste or smell Sore throat Congestion or runny nose Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea Students, parents and staff will be ASKED; o Have you been exposed to/come in close contact with someone who has COVID -19? School staff will LOOK, visually inspect each student, and staff member for signs of illness which could include flushed cheeks, rapid breathing or difficulty breathing (without recent physical activity), fatigue or extreme fussiness. Any individual meeting a \"Yes\" fo r any of the above criteria, ASK, ASK, LOOK, screening , will not be allowed entry into the school and will be instructed to call their health care provider for next steps. Once students are in school, temperature checks will be conducted using contact -less thermometers if a student or staff is exhibiting symptoms of feeling ill.

This information will be collected in an App. We wil l mark direction lines and six-foot separation standing spots on the exterior pavement and post procedures for health screening checkpoint ahead. We will evaluate shelter accommodations to protect students in line from the elements (e.g., sun and rain). Also, we will evaluate safety of outdoor lines related to safety and security threats (e.g., behavioral issues, traffic). We will Identify entry and exit points that avoid cross traffic at building access points, if possible. Daily Health Screenings Students, families, and staff will be asked health screening questions and complete temperature checks each day prior to entering. In the event a staff member must take a student's temperature, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends several procedures to do so safely. During temperature checks, use of barriers or personal protective equipment (PPE) helps to eliminate or minimize exposures due to close contact with a person who has symptoms. Use of non -conta ct thermometers is encouraged. See Hygiene section for thermometer cleaning. PPE can be used if a temperature check cannot be performed by a parent/guardian or barrier/partition controls cannot be implemented. CDC states that reliance on PPE is less effe ctive and more difficult to implement because of PPE shortages and training requirements. If staff do not have experience in using PPE, the CDC has recommended sequences for donning and doffing PPE. To follow this option staff should: Wash hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol. Put on PPE. This includes a face mask, eye protection (goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face), and a single pair of disposable gloves. A gown should be considered if extensive contact with the individual being screened is anticipated. Take the individual's temperature. Remove and discard PPE. Wash hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol. Clean the thermometer following the directions below. 35 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Small Group Cohorts LEA B has taken measures in its scheduling and planning to achieve the following grouping practices: The school will group students and staff together each day (as opposed to mixing groups of teachers and students, where possible).

LEA B will strive to keep the employees delivering to selected classrooms each day. Students will eat meals in the classroom to avoid mixing in the cafeteria. Meal distribution, eating, and waste collection will occur with six feet separation coordinated with one -way traffic arrows and queue lines marked on the floor of the classroom where possible. Additionally, Students will wash hands before and after eating, and may not share food, utensils, cups, or plates. Staff will wash hands before and after preparing food, and after helping children to eat. Students will sit in their assigned learning space while eating their meals. After the meals, students and teachers will wipe down desks. Recess and Breaks LEA B will maximize the amount of time students and staff are outside. Additionally, LEA B will continue to hold recess and/or outside playtime, and will maintain physical distance between students outside , including staggering groups and dividing space outside as needed. We will schedule outdoor activities and learning within the master calendar. Additionally, LEA B teachers will get needed breaks throughout the day when they teach on campus. Postponi ng, Canceling or Eliminating On -Campus Activities LEA B will cancel, eliminate, or modify some of our on -campus activities: 36 1050 First St. NE , Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Cancel or modify classes where students are likely to be in very close proximity. Cancel activities and events such as field trips, student assemblies, athletic events or practices, special performances, and school -wide in person parent meetings. Eliminate non -essential travel for staff and teachers (e.g., conferences). Revise the process for receiving mail and packages; only ha ve necessary delivered and combine orders so fewer deliveries are made. Limit non -essential visitors (e.g., prohibit outside visitors from entering the school unless their presence was requested or if they received permission to enter the school). Stagger activities' times or locations by cohort to maximum extent feasible. Immunizations & Enrollment Maintaining student health is our top priority. The COVID -19 pandemic has emphasized the importance of protecting children against contagious diseases. Now, m ore than ever, families should make appointments and receive their necessary immunizations and flu shots. As a part of the student enrollment process, the enrollment team/registrar will confirm that all student vaccinations are up to date. If it is determined that a student has been unable to get vaccines, the Director of Enrollment will coordinate with the student support team and school nurse (if assigned) to support the student in getting an up -to-date screening. Parents can email completed medical and dental forms and immunization records to the LEA. Click here for immunization requirements by age. Face Coverings All LEA B staff, contractors, adult visitors, and other personnel will wear face coverings at all times when in the building, and whe n outside of the building when in close proximity to students and families. If an adult has a medical condition that prevents them from wearing a face covering, they must have documentation on file from a medical provider that they are not able to do so. W e will work with all staff during onboarding to ensure that accommodations are met. Otherwise that individual should not participate in in -person school activities. Students are required to wear cloth face coverings during arrival, dismissal, and at all times while moving around the school building. Students under the age of 2 will not be required to wear a face covering. Older children, adolescents and adult students will be required to wear face covering when in the hallways, bathrooms, or other communal spaces within the facility. Instances when face coverings need to be worn: 37 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Students should wear face coverings as feasible, and most importantly when physical distancing is difficult (e.g., hallways, restrooms) and on their travel to and from the school if using public transportation. While visitors to the school should be strictly limited, should a visitor need to enter they should wear a face covering on the school grounds and inside the school buildings at all times. Instances when face coverings do not need to be worn: Outdoors when social distancing of at least six feet is strictly enforced. By anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone unconscious or unable to remove the mask without assistance. By children during naptime. Ensur ing the safe use of clean cloth face coverings: Students and staff will bring multiple cloth face coverings with them to school. In the event that a student, staff, or guest does not have a face covering, one will be provided by LEA B . Staff and students w ill exercise caution when removing the covering, always storing it out of reach of other students, and wash hands immediately after removing it. If a student or staff member tampers with the face covering of another student or staff member, it should be removed immediately and replaced with a clean one. Hygiene LEA B will prioritize personal (hand) and school -wide hygiene practices that prevent and contain the spread of disease, including COVID -19. School -wide Hygiene: LEA B will work with our staff and the janitorial/custodial services provider to ensure that the following environment will occur to maintain a healthy environment. A Health Screen occurs for all people entering the school. Health Screen materials are properly cleaned. Adequate supplies (e.g., soap, paper towels, hand sanitizer, tissue) are readily available in every bathroom and classroom throughout the day. All students will be provided with their own materials in designated and labeled bags or bins. All student belongings will be separated and stored in designated areas (e.g. locker, cubby, bin). Electronic devices (e.g. computers, smartphones, Chromebook) will be assigned to an individual. In the event that a student may need to borrow one (e.g. IT issue, forgot), the school will provide recently sanitized equipment. 38 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Increase air circulation only wh ere safe and possible and ensure ventilation systems are operating properly. Encourage staff and students to cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Used tissues should be thrown in the trash and hands washed immediately with soap and water for at least 2 0 seconds. Install no -touch fixtures where possible (e.g., automatic faucets and toilets, touchless foot door openers, touchless trash cans, touchless hand sanitizer dispensers). Drinking fountains will not be used other than to refill individual bottles . LEA B has 2 bottle filling stations on the 4th and 3rd floors. Additionally, all the classroom sinks on the 1st and 2nd floors have water bottle filling faucets with filtered water. Regular hand sanitizing will be enforced: Ensure handwashing strategies include washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, use an alcohol- based hand sanitizer that contains at least the recommended percent alcohol. (NOT METHANOL) Make hand cleaning supplies readily available in classrooms, bathrooms, and offices. Set up sanitizing stations outside of large common spaces in cluding the MPR, playgrounds or outdoor spaces, and entrances/exits. Students will wash or sanitize their hands when both entering and exiting a classroom or between activities. All classrooms have touchless hand sanitizer dispensers located just outside the room. Students will walk across shoe disinfecting mats before entering the classroom. All classrooms will have shoe disinfectant mats located just outside the classroom door. Enforce a \"you touch it, you take it\" policy in classrooms and the lunchroo m. High -Risk Individuals Students and staff at high -risk for contracting or experiencing severe illness due to COVID -19 will be cleared by their medical provider before participating in on -site activities. Consideration will also be made for live -in fami ly members of students or staff at high -risk. Risk factors include: Chronic Lung Disease Moderate to Severe Asthma Serious heart conditions Immunocompromised conditions Severe obesity (>40 Body Mass Index) Diabetes Chronic kidney disease, and/or Liver Disease People 65 years and older 39 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Any child, parent, or staff member who has a medical condition not on this list, but is still concerned about their safety Exclusion or Dismissal from On -Campus Learning LEA B will adhere to the following exclusion and dismissal criteria: Exclusion Criteria: Students and staff must stay home, or not be admitted if: The student or staff member has had a temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher, Any member of their household is confirmed to have COVID -19, or Any member of their household is awaiting COVID -19 test results. If a student or staff member reports any of the above symptoms or exposure, or is confirmed to have COVID -19, the student or staff member must not return to school until: 72 hours after the fever has resolved without the use of fever -reducing medication (e.g. Motrin, Tylenol) and respiratory symptoms have improved; AND at least 10 days after symptoms first appeared, whichever is later; OR per their healthcare provider following DC health instructions. If any student or staff member has been in close contact with a person who is positive for COVID -19, then the student or staff member must not enter the facility until cleared by their healthcare prov ider or has completed their quarantine period without becoming symptomatic or diagnosed with COVID -19. If any student or staff member has been in close contact with a person who is awaiting a COVID -19 test result, then the student or staff member must not enter the facility until the close contact tests negative. If the close contact tests positive, then they should seek guidance from their healthcare provider or DC Health. Dismissal Criteria: If a student or staff member develops a fever or other signs of illness, the school must follow the above exclusion criteria regarding the exclusion and dismissal of students and staff. For students, the school is to immediately isolate the student from other students, notify the student's parent/guardian of the symp toms and that the student needs to be picked up as soon as possible, and immediately follow cleaning and disinfecting procedures for any area and materials with which the student was in contact. For staff, the school is to send the staff member home immed iately and follow cleaning and disinfecting procedures for any area, materials, and equipment with which the staff member was in contact. 40 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov If a school staff member must take a student's temperature at any point, they should follow CDC guidelines to do so safely, including with the use of barrier protection or Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). COVID -19 Exposure: Reporting, Notification, and Disinfecting To ensure a clear and efficient process for communication, the school has identified a staff member as the internal COVID -19 point of contact (POC). This person is responsible for ensuring the below steps are followed in the event of a confirmed case of CO VID-19. LEA B will ask families and staff to complete a short survey if they believe they have been exposed to COVID. LEA B staff will follow up with the following steps for anyone in our community who has been exposed to COVID. Step 1: Report to DC Health Department The school will follow existing procedures for reporting communicable disease. In the event of a confirmed case of COVID -19 in a student, staff member, or any individual who has entered the building, the school will notify DC Health by submitting the online case report (via this lin k). Step 2: Communication to Families and Staff Schools are to have communication protocols in place that protect the privacy of individuals and alert their families and staff to a COVID -19 case. Communication is to be completed, per DC Health directive and will include: Notification to all staff and families in the event of change of school schedule, Notification to those staff and families of students in close contact with the individual and will state the requirement to quarantine for 14 day s; and Notification to the entire program that there was a COVID -19 positive case, those impacted have been told to quarantine, and all areas that the individual was in contact with will be cleaned, sanitized, and disinfected. We will notify families thr ough a variety of channels. For specific information on how we communicate with families and staff during emergencies or unexpected events, please see this section below. Step 3: Cleaning, Sanitization, and Disinfection of Affected Spaces In the event of a confirmed COVID -19 case in a student or staff member, the school must immediately close the room(s) the COVID- 19 positive individual was in once all students in that group have exited the school and follow cleaning, disinfection and sanitization guida nce from the CDC, linked here : If se ven days or fewer have passed since the person who is sick used the facility, follow these steps: 1. Close off areas used by the person who is sick. 41 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov 2. Ensure thermostat has fan on high and ensure fresh air system runs all day / night to increase circulation within room 3. The next day, add portable UVC equipment to room and run equipment for 12 hours (or more) to thoroughly clean the air. 4. After 48 hours, clean and disinfect all areas used by the person who is sick, such as classrooms, bathrooms, and common areas. If more than seven days have passed since the person who is sick used the facility, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary. Continue routine cleaning and disinfection. 42 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Instructional Delivery Questio n 5. Describe how the LEA will deliver instruction in order to achieve continuous learning during SY 2020 -21. Identify the instructional methods (e.g., 100% synchronous instruction, student -guided instruction, etc.), and platforms (e.g., the product name if using a learning man agement system (LMS)), and materials (e.g., textbooks, teacher -generated resources, computer software, etc.) your schools will use during SY 2020 -21 to ensure rigor across settings; Explain the total instructional hours per day for the typical student participating in your distance learning program. Provide a breakdown of anticipated hours spent in a synchronous learning environment (learning that happens in real time with the student and teache r together) and asynchronous learning environment ( independent learning that takes place without real -time input from the teacher); Describe the training and professional development for school staff to support the effective implementation of this instructi onal plan; and Describe the manner in which the LE A will ensure the plan is routinely monitored and adjusted, as needed, to address the needs of every student in the LEA across learning environments. Sample Responses While LEA C developed a schedule differentiated by grade span that uses both synchronous and asynchronous methods, the vast majority of the time is synchronous and incorporates a broad curriculum that includes the humanities, enrichment, and science. LEA C intends to us e Wednesday to engage with small intervention groups based on student need and provid e asynchronous instruction for the remainder of th at day. LEA D plans to p rovide families with instructional choices based on a tiered system. The LEA will offer a hybrid model combining two days of in person instruction per week with remote instruction on other days and a 100% virtual model. The instructional plan outlines steps for synchronous and asynchronous community building to support socialization and enrichment. LEA D outlined a strong method of reviewing its plan in tandem wi th student evidence and data to make future adjustments. LEA Detail LEA Name LEA Response LEA C Instructional Methods, Platforms, and Materials : LEA C will be providing 100% virtual instruction through Quarter 1 (August 31 -October 30, 2020). As data from DC and the CDC becomes available throughout this time period, we will make a decision as to instructional delivery (virtual, hybrid, or in -person) for Quarter 2. Students in K -8 will receive synchronous instruction via Zoom, and asynchronous assignments will be posted daily in Google Classrooms, where teachers will also be monitoring for work completion. In PreK3 and PreK4, students will receive synchron ous instruction via Zoom daily and will receive asynchronous work via the Seesaw platform. During asynchronous learning, students will also have access to a variety of online learning platforms, including Great Minds' InSync Platform for Eureka Math and Wi t & Wisdom, Edmentum Exact Path for 43 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov grades 3 -8, Edmentum Reading Eggs in K -2, Newsela, IXL Math, and Learning A to Z. All students will be equipped with appropriate devices to complete virtual learning. In PreK, students will receive iPads. In grades K -1, students will receive Lenovo tablets with a detachable keyboard. In grades 2 -8, all students will receive Chromebooks. Additionally, students will receive all workbooks and texts needed to complete curriculum -related work. This includes workbooks for Eurek a Math in K -8, readers, text sets, and workbooks for CKLA in K- 2, and text sets for Wit & Wisdom in grades 3 - 8. Materials will be distributed to families the week before school starts. This process will be coordinated by principals and campus operations ma nagers and will follow CDC guidelines for social distancing. Instructional Hours : Across all grade levels, students will be engaged in both synchronous and asynchronous learning on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays. On Wednesdays, students will be involved in mostly asynchronous learning, with some synchronous small group instruction as needed. We have strived to create a learning schedule that is both developmentally appropriate and responsive to the difficulties created by online teaching and lea rning, particularly at the lower grade levels. As such, time guidelines for virtual instruction vary by grade level. In general, students will be engaged in a blend of both synchronous and asynchronous learning every day except for Wednesday between 9:00am and 4:00pm, with breaks, lunch, and recreational time included. Though each campus leader is responsible for creating a synchronous learning schedule that meets the needs of their particular community, academic time parameters have been mandated at the district level for Humanities, Math, Science, and Enrichment, as described below: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday: Grades PreK3 and PreK4 o Synchronous Learning: 60 minutes per day that includes both small group and 1 -1 learning time o Asynchronous Learning: 30 minutes per day o Total: 90 minutes per day Grades K -2 o Synchronous Learning: 155 -180 minutes ( approx. 2.5-3 hours) per day that includes targeted, differentiated small group instruction in literacy and mathematics, a full group morning meeting, and focused Enrichment time o Asynchronous Learning: 80 -90 minutes per day that is a combination of math and readi ng work o Total: 235 -270 minutes (approx. 4 -4.5 hours) per day combined for math, literacy, enrichment, and morning meeting Grades 3 -4 44 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 (202) -6436 180 -215 minutes ( approx. 3-3.5 hours) per day that includes targeted, differentiated small group instruction in literacy, humanities, and mathematics, a full group morning meeting, and focused enrichment time. o Asynchronous Learning: 50 -70 minutes per day that is a combination of math and humanities work (students will alternate amount of asynchronous work required with small group synchronous time) o Total: 250 -265 minutes ( approx. 4-4.5 hours) per day combined for math, humanities, enrichment, and morning meeting Grades 5 -8 o Synchro nous Learning: 230 -275 minutes ( approx. 3.75- 4.5 hours) per day that includes targeted, differentiated small group instruction in humanities, mathematics, and science, a full group morning meeting, and focused Enrichment time. o Asynchronous Learning: 50 -70 minutes per day that is a combination of math and humanities work (students will alternate amount of asynchronous work required with small group synchronous time) o Total: 280 -345 minutes ( approx. 4.75- 5.75 hours) per day (lower side of this range for grade 5, higher for grade 8) Wednesday: Grades PreK3 -PreK4: o Synchronous: Morning Meeting (30 minutes) and small intervention groups as, needed o Asynchronous: 30 minutes of independent work Grades K -2: o Synchronous: Small intervention groups, as needed o Asynchronous: 105 -150 minutes (approx. 1.75 -2.5 hours) per day in reading and math Grades 3 -4: o Synchronous: Small intervention groups, as needed o Asynchronous: 120 -150 minutes (approx. 2 -2.5 hours) per day in reading and math Grades 5 -8: o Synchronous: Small intervention groups, as needed o Asynchronous: 165 -185 minutes (approx. 2.75 -3 hours) per day in reading, math, and science Training and Professional Development Over the summer, we required all instructional staff to complete the Google Fundamentals training and to receive Google Educator Level 1 certification. This provided all teachers with a baseline understanding of how to use GSuite for Education and to use Google Classrooms as our LMS. 45 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Professional learning will take place from August 3rd through Aug ust 21st. During the first two weeks (8/3 -8/14), all teachers will engage in targeted, content- specific professional development (PD) in our curriculum and in adapting instruction for distance learning. PD will be differentiated both by role and by level o f experience. During the third week, teachers will be engaged in PD provided by their campus leadership teams. In the first week of PD, new teachers will engage in primarily synchronous learning with members of the Central Office Programming, Academic, an d Leadership Team (PAL - which includes the following departments: Leadership Management, Curriculum & Instruction, Student Support Services, Family Engagement, and Data & Assessment). This PD will introduce teachers to our curriculum and to the Common Core/NGSS shifts. While new teachers are engaging in synchronous learning, returning teachers will be engaging in a variety of asynchronous experiences meant to deepen their understanding or curriculum, pedagogy, and best practices in a distance learning spac e. For example, primary and Humanities teachers will be required to complete modules in foundational literacy and guided reading and close reading. All teachers will be required to complete the Modern Classrooms Foundational Training (provided by moderncla ssrooms.org ) and select teachers will be required to complete certain modules in the Google Advanced Training. All asynchronous learning will include a deliverable to be completed by the end of the day (such as a welcome video for students, a sample Google classroom setup, and/or a written reflection). Teachers will also meet in their common grade/content PLC's throughout the week to share their learning, collaborate, and begin prepping their Google Classrooms. During the second week of PD (8/10 -8/14), teachers will engage in both synchronous and asynchronous learning. Many of our Humanities and Science teachers will participate in PBL 101 through PBL Works, which is being offered virtually. The training has been modified to allow teachers to reflect on how to bring project -based learning into a virtual space. This training is essential to these teachers, as LEA C uses a PBL -approach in both Social Studies and Science instruction, and this should not be disrupted by distance learning; on the contrary, PBL offers us another tool to engage students in independent learning and research, which is ideal for distance learning. Additionally, Humanities and Science teachers will continue to collaborate in their content PLC 's, and they will have targeted PD in many of the online platforms we will be using for both learning and assessment (Kami, Nearpod, Zoom, Edmentum, etc.). Primary and Math teachers will similarly be engaged in workshops around tools for distance learning and will participate in \"deep dives\" into our accelerated scope and sequence and into the first module of our curriculum. By the end of the week, teachers will have created their classroom spaces in Google Classrooms and will have planned the first several weeks of instruction. 46 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: During the third week of PD (8/17 -8/21), teachers will be engaged in professional learning designed by campus principals. During this time, they will receive information about work expectations, schedules, performance review, and ma terials distribution (which will take place 8/24 -8/28). Monitoring the Instructional Delivery Plan Campus schedule will include joining information for every synchronous session, which will be accessible to principals, assistant principals, and members of the Leadership Management, Curriculum & Instruction and Student Support Services teams. This will enable campus and district leaders and instructional coaches to access any live session to observe and to support learning. Additionally, all campus leaders will have access to each teacher's Google Classroom so that the posting of assignments and tracking of independent work can be monitored. The platforms that will be used for independent work (such as Great Minds InSync, Edmentum Exact Path) will be monitor ed by both campus and district leadership. To ensure that monitoring is taking place, the Curriculum & Instruction and Student Support Services teams will continue to meet once a week to review data from learning platforms and to create additional profess ional learning plans based on observations of live sessions. Similarly, the PAL Team will continue to meet once a week to ensure alignment across departments. Regardless of distance or in -person learning, all campus leaders participate in a quarterly data meeting with the Managing Director of Schools, Director of Curriculum & Instruction, Director of Special Education, Director of Data & Assessment, and the Director of Student & Family Engagement to discuss trends in student learning, student data, attendan ce, and to ascertain which students are at risk for retention. These will continue during distance learning, and we will modify the agenda to include our monitoring of student attendance in synchronous learning and their completion of asynchronous work. St udents who continue to be absent or who are not completing asynchronous work will be flagged, and families will be contacted. All principals and assistant principals will meet once per month as a PLC with the Managing Director of Schools and the Director of Curriculum & Instruction. These meetings will be an opportunity to engage in collaborative learning and problem solving and to review and monitor distance learning expectations and shifts, should they occur. LEA D Overview This plan describes how LEA D will meet its mission, goals, and student academic achievement expectations as set forth in its charter agreement through synchronous and asynchronous remote and on -site learning opportunities. The plan provides students, fa milies, staff, DC PCSB and OSSE with a thorough understanding of the day -to-day learning. The plan centers on equity, ensuring that all students, including students who are at risk, per the city's 47 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov definition, English learners, and/or with disabilities, are able to access all learning opportunities without further compromising their health and social- emotional well- being. Instruction at LEA D will be structured in such a way to allow for uninterrupted learning by students when health and safety guidance c hanges (such as moving from Phase II to Phase III) or when the school facility is closed to staff and students due to an acute outbreak or citywide declaration. For each school day, a student will be expected to engage in a robust and developmentally appro priate day of learning with synchronous breaks for socializing. The following options are available to families enrolling in LEA D for school year 2020 -21. We will re -evaluate models periodically and families may re -evaluate their model choices and there MAY be limited opportunities for families to move from virtual learning to hybrid, depending on space availability to accommodate additional students and staff within public health guidelines. Families may move to all virtual learning at any time. Instructional Options & Schedule ITDS has determined that MTSS tiers allow for a more seamless integration of academic, behavior and social- emotional foci and therefore serve as the foundation for our instructional plan. Tier 1 o Synchronous & asynchronous instruction for all students via whole group, small group or 1 -on-1 focused on prioritized standards, scheduled intervention/enrichment blocks focused on specific content determined by assessment data Tier 2A o Targeted synchronous instruction in small group s or 1 -on-1 based on assessment data provided by the lead teacher. This will be in addition to Tier 1 instruction. Tier 2B o Targeted synchronous instruction either in small groups or 1 -on-1 provided by an Instructional Specialist (interventionist). Instruc tion will happen 'outside' of the classroom - meaning a student will not miss Tier 1 instruction in the supported subject area. Additionally, targeted goals will be developed by the Instructional Specialist with input from the classroom teacher. Tier 3 o See Special Populations Section Hybrid Model Attend school in -person for two days per week, and attend school remotely using both synchronous and asynchronous activities with a teacher three days a week. For asynchronous learning, students may work on a var iety 48 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov of activities, some of which may require students using computers, but many may be done without technology to be submitted when in -person or through the use of photos. Virtual Model- Synchronous & Asynchronous (applicable during both 100% virtual & hybrid models) Our Virtual Model will be for all students August - early November, public health conditions permitting. When we move to offering a Hybrid model, the Virtual School Model will continue to be available for students who are immunocompromised or who have a family member who is immunocompromised or whose family would prefer that the child not attend school in -person. In this option, the students will experience learning from home five days a week via synchronous and asynchronous learning. The lea rning may not require the student to be logged onto the computer but rather engaging in activities at the same time as their peers on -site. Additionally, students will be able to access content teachers for pre- determined and communicated office hours thro ughout the school week. Instruction Personnel Master/Lead Teacher: Responsible for a group of students who, together, will be considered a \"class.\" The teacher will see some of their class on -site and some remotely. The teacher is responsible for all aspects of instructional planning, delivery and assessment. Engagement with students will happen through whole group and small group instruction, as well as one -to-one support both in -person and via virtual learning. This adult will be the teacher of record for attendance and will also be the primary contact for families. Refer to our attendance policy for how attendance will be determined, including examples of student interactions that will be used. Special Education Team: Responsible for providing and managing IEP services for Special Education students. The Special Education teachers and Dedicated Aides will collaborate with the General Education teacher to meet all IEP goals, services and accommodations. Assistant Teacher (Preschoo l-4th): Partners with a master/lead teacher and is responsible for a group of students who, together, will be considered a \"class.\" The assistant teacher will engage in whole group and small group instruction, as well as provide one -to-one support for spec ific students both in -person and via virtual learning. Additionally, the assistant teacher provides administrative support for master/lead teachers. Resident Teacher: Assigned to work with a 'Master' lead teacher throughout the academic year. The residen t teacher is enrolled in a certification program and will gradually take over aspects of instructional planning, delivery and assessment. Engagement with students will happen through whole group and small group instruction, as well as one -to-one support bo th in -person and via virtual learning. Culture & Access Team: Members of this team will help support classrooms on a rotating basis around social - emotional learning, as well as attendance monitoring and overall school engagement. For remote learners, the 49 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Culture & Access Team will focus on students showing severe or persistent signs of disengagement, help trouble - shoot engagement issues (IT, wrap around services, content), and triage support for the student as needed. Operations Team: Members of this team will help support classrooms on a rotating basis to allow the teachers (master/lead, assistant and resident) to take scheduled breaks throughout the day. Learning Modes Synchronous Learning: When remote, this instruction is conducted via a platform in whi ch student(s) and teacher are interacting directly with one another. Instruction may be given via direct instruction or with students working on projects, monitored by the teacher. The expectation is that the student(s) may ask questions and the teacher may ask questions of the student(s) to engage in real time student- learning. Instructional tasks will involve a range of activities from completing an on -line assignment or game to reading a book and annotating the text or analyzing and solving math problems . Tasks can be group work or individual work. Asynchronous Learning: This instruction requires the teacher to prepare learning that can be accessed any -time, any-where. An example of this type of learning would be a pre -recorded video in which the teacher provides instruction on new material. Tasks for this type of learning can be done individually or in small groups. The teacher will expect the work to be completed by a certain time each day or week. Homework also fits into this category. To ensure that the work is completed each day and students are engaged and progressing, assignments will be designated for collection daily or weekly and will be used to measure attendance and engagement. Assignments will be reviewed by the teacher and returned to student s to ensure that each child receives feedback and is supported in their understanding of concepts presented. (See attendance policy for further details.) Regardless of the product, it may be collected through the Google Classroom, by photographing the work , or through different logs/journals. Community Building Synchronous Community Building: Planned time will be incorporated in the school day to promote student socialization and social- emotional learning. Such activities will be done through group engage ment on -line including games, structured conversations, and free -form conversations about developmentally appropriate topics of interest to the students. Additionally, students will be given opportunities to engage in activities with peers that do not requ ire adult supervision. Such activities can include games (on -line trivial pursuit, scavenger hunts, etc.) that students can engage in independently. Asynchronous Community Building: Adult -directed activities to build community, such as group projects, par tner - work, and other opportunities for students to connect with one another in informal ways will be provided. There will be a continuously growing database of school- approved and provided web -based sites that students may use at any time so long as they f ollow the school culture and behavior policy, particularly with respect to our 50 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov prohibition on cyber bullying. The unstructured time with friends allows for a deepening affinity for the community and facilitates connection between and among students. Professional Development Prior to the start of school, teachers will receive training on Google Classroom, Clever and all of the approved applications by members of the Operations Team, Continuous Learning Team and/or Leadership Team. In addition, staff will engage in professional development throughout the year on Wednesdays, as well as previously identified days during the academic year. Professional development will focus on optimizing the effectiveness of virtual learning, assessing student learning, s ocial- emotional learning, tier 2 interventions, student engagement during virtual learning, and building community while remote. Teachers will also support one another through grade -level and cross grade -level collaborative meetings. Dedicated time has bee n built into the schedule to allow for collaboration between general education and special education teachers, along with instructional interventionists. Additionally, formal instruction will end each day by 2:15pm and the teacher's work day will end at 4pm. Each day, teachers and community leaders will have access to the IT department, behavioral support specialist, support staff, department and grade lead s, and other instructional staff to troubleshoot issues that occur both on -site and remotely. Timely Intervention Teachers will get weekly reports on each of their students enrolled in math/reading intervention to supplement information they are gleanin g from student participation, small groups, work completion and formative assessments. When needed, a member of the Culture & Access Team will contact the family daily to determine if a student is disengaging and why. The staff member will triage issues an d refer other specialists to support a student or family, such as: information technology, counseling, and learning. Continuous Improvement LEA D will be in operation for 180 days. The schedule will be based on a trimester system to allow for updates an d changes to meet the immediate needs and to adjust to the latest DC reopening phase. All changes to school scheduling will occur on the planned trimester start date except when there is an emergency requiring a transition from on -site to remote learning. Families may choose to change their schedule on an as -needed basis through direct communication with the school. The school will accommodate all families for the start of each trimester and adjust as possible. During trimesters, there MAY be limited opp ortunities to move to hybrid, depending on space availability to accommodate additional students and staff within public health guidelines. Families may move to all virtual learning at any time. 51 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Twice a month , member s of the LEA D Leadership Team, along with members of the Culture & Access team will engage in a school- wide data analysis of student performance on formative assessments, disaggregated by schedule type (hybrid, on -site, remote synchronous, remote asynchronous). The analysis will control for o ther variables (e.g. housing instability, special education status) to confirm that each mode of content instruction is providing equitable results for student learning and growth. Future professional development will be planned based on the results of t he analysis. If it is determined that some instructional strategies are more (or less) effective than others, these will be replicated, replacing the less effective strategies. Once a month, students, who have shown the least engagement whether by attenda nce or work product, will be evaluated through the Whole Child Collaborative. The team will determine the potential cause of disengagement, from equipment or Wi -Fi issues, to mental health to difficulties with content. Depending on the results, the student 's educational program will be modified to ensure appropriate support. All students will take the Devereux Students Strengths Assessment (DESSA), a social emotional learning assessment, multiple times per year. Based on the results, modifications will be made to the learning plan for cohorts or individual students.

Question 6. Describe the LEA's policy for identifying and administering assessments during SY 2020 -21, including: Which formative assessment(s) the LEA will use to measure student learning ( and learning loss) at the start of SY 2020 -21. Select all that apply: How the LEA will plan to assess students who either do not attend school regularly in person, or who participate exclusively in distance learning. Describe the specific modalities you plan to use to ensure every student is assessed (e.g., at- home diagnostic assessments, online proctoring, physically in the building). Describe if modalities differ by grade bands. When the LEA intends to administer these assessments during the school year, specifying for each assessment. Sample Response The response from LEA E was clear and organized ; the LEA created and shared a det ailed chart that listed out the grade, subject, name , timeframe, testing modality, and interventions and support for each asse ssment. LEA Detail LEA Name LEA Response LEA E LEA E is responsible for meeting the goals and student academic achievement expectations as set forth in its charter and its Strategic School Plan. It is also requesting from the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) a waiver from offering six h ours of instruction each day. The policy below describes LEA E 's commitment to assessing and learning. This policy supports the school's charter and does not replace the commitments set forth within. The policy summarized below describes the formative as sessments that LEA E will use to assess student learning during the 2020 -2021 school year. These assessments are not considered part of high stakes accountability and student test results will only be shared with the DC PCSB or OSSE if it is explicitly defined in LEA E 's charter agreement or if mandated for all LEAs. Results of all assessments will be used primarily to inform instruction (including interventions and extensions) and will be shared with the student and parent/guardian. The policy describes the formative assessments the school is considering administering for all middle school students (both those on -campus and those learning remotely), when each assessment will be administered, and the manner in which LEA E will provide academic intervention and support. The policy also discusses grade level promotion requirements. 53 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Assessment Integrity All families at LEA E will sign testing integrity agreements that include the parameters in which families, classmates, and others may help students on asses sments and how the Internet and other resources may be used during assessments.

Question(s) 7. Describe if/how student grading and promotion policies will be altered in light of distance learning. If the LEA is not chang ing its grading and promotion policy to accommodate distance learning, the LEA may provide a link to the policy or describe the exi sting policy. Sample Response LEA F included a through explanation of grading categories and weights, assignments, \"look fors \", assessments and late work. The submission was also very specific regarding policy changes. LEA Detail LEA Name LEA Response LEA F LEA F's first priority is to ensure that scholars are mastering state -mandated academic standards. We recognize that mastery can be shown in multiple ways. Our grading categories and weights have been designed to give an overall level of m astery through assessment, practice, and participation. To ensure consistency across grade averages, scholars' grades will reflect the following categories and weights. Category Percentage Description Major Assessments - District Assessments (Unit Tests/APTs) 30% Benchmarks, school level assessments and End of unit performance tasks requiring students to demonstrate their mastery of the unit's content through the completion of a novel/ \"real -world\" application task. Minor Assessments - Quizzes 30% In class quizzes and assessments that cover small chunks (sections vs. units), some exit tickets, usually occur weekly. Daily Work 30% This includes but is not limited to problem sets, text - dependent questions, classwork, warm ups, journals, S ocratic seminars, class discussions, activators, summarizers, homework, individualized practice, etc. Participation 10% Participation can be linked to work effort and completion. This may look like engagement in Socratic seminars, presentations, group projects, or in -class responses. 56 1050 First St. NE , Washington, Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Assignments: Each week, scholars will receive at least three grades including one daily work, one minor assessment, and one participation grade. (Every week, scholars will receive a quiz (exit ticket) grade reflecting their mastery of content standards and grade -level content. Examples of participation are described below.) Each quarter, scholars should com plete at least two major assessments/exams. All assignments should be submitted by 6pm each day. (Instructors will communicate exceptions for long- term projects, tasks, etc.) Participation Look Fors: Scholars are on screen and actively engaging. (Special c ircumstances should be communicated to the instructor.) Scholars participate when called on or willingly. Scholar's comments and questions are based on the learning at hand. Scholars frequently read, write, and discuss the material they are learning. When prompted, scholars are able to identify and/or explain lesson objectives. When prompted, scholars can describe how to complete the learning task. When in small groups, scholars work collaboratively, contributing and accomplishing the task at hand. Schola r is on task, focused and displays a high level of effort for most of the lesson. Scholars generally follow procedures with minimal prompting from the teacher. Assessments: All assessments will be provided through our secure virtual platforms (Edulastic, Agile, SpringBoard, etc.) Scholars are required to be logged on to the appropriate platforms with their screens(videos) on. All scholars should complete the assessments during the testing windows provided ( multiple windows can be provided.) by the instruc tor with screens on. Middle School Late Work: Late work for unexcused absences will result in a 5% reduction of the earned grade per day that the work is late. (This does not apply to excused absences). High School Late Work: Late work for unexcused absences will result in a 10% reduction of the earned grade per day that the work is late. (This does not apply to excused absences). 57 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Attendance & Attendance Controls Question 9. Describe the LEA's policy for student attendance through distance learning. In your response, be sure to identify whether the LEA is using Option A and/or Option B. The LEA should respond to the questions associated with each response. In crafting your response, note the following: Schools are expected to implement their normal, in -person attendance policies and procedures when students are on school grounds 10. LEAs that serve students that are not compulsory age (Pre- K 3, Pre -K 4, and Adult) are not required to abide by the above attendance polic y. However, they should describe their attendance expectations and policies for students. Option A: The LEA is using a learning management system (LMS) for distance learning. o How is the student's presence authenticated daily using the LMS? o What constitutes sufficient engagement in the LMS for the student to be marked present? Option B: The LEA is not using a learning management system (LMS) for distance learning. o What is the complete listing of acceptable methods for making one -on-one contact with the stu dent authenticate a student's presence? o What is the procedure the LEA will use to make one- on-one contact with the student to authenticate a student's presence? o What constitutes evidence of education engagement daily for the student to be marked present? o How will the LEA collect, verify, enter, and store supporting data (based on its gf selection[s] above) to ensure that the official attendance records of students are accurate? o What student- level data specifically would be furnished to OSSE in the event of an audit of attendance records? Sample Responses LEA G intends on using Option A and, in its plan, stated that will use multiple methods to authenticate the presence of each individual student in the virtual classroom ( e.g., phone calls, submissions of student work, face -to-face contact through an online platform , etc. ) and ensure student engagement through a variety of means, including viewing lessons, engaging in dis cussion, and completion of assignments . The LEA even went so far as to provide a matrix that outlines the criteria for each level of attendance (i.e., present, p artial day present, a bsent ) by learning modality (i.e., o n-site synchronous , on- site asynchrono us, remote synchronous , remote asynchronous ). LEA H also intends to use Option A and i ts plan had clear methods to meet the two -part test for attendance : the LEA will both authenticate student presence ( e.g., face -to-face contact or logging on to the LMS, Schoology ). LEA H 's response was notable because it exceeded the expectations of the question to outline how it pl ans to follow up with families in the case of a missed instructional day and provided detail about supporting students with technological issues. 58 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov LEA Detail LEA Name LEA Response LEA G (Question 9 ) Option A (LEA using LMS for distance learning. ) In SY 2020 -21, LEA G will utilize two types of attendance: in -person and distance learning: Our in-person attendance will be implemented in accordance with our normal, in -person attendance policies, which delineate how a student is counted as present, what types of absences are excused and unexcused, and what level of presence constitutes a full or partial school day. Our distan ce learning attendance will be implemented as outlined below and will record attendance as outlined below. In our distance learning schedule for SY 2020 -21, students will have a synchronous advisory session each day. Teachers who serve as advisors will tak e daily attendance during the advisory calls and will log that attendance in our DeansList platform. Data from DeansList feeds automatically into our PowerSchool system. Touchpoints that LEA G will use include the following methods: Phone conversations or virtual meeting one -on-one with instructional staff to discuss content, i.e. attending a teacher's virtual tutorial by Zoom Direct 'face -to-face' online contact through class Zoom, Skype, Google Hangout, etc. Completed exit tickets (Google form, etc.) after viewing a pre -recorded video OR using software such as IXL that provides demonstration of similar completion of work Completed assignments uploaded within Unified Classroom or other similar platform from daily activity (>50% complete wil l be considered present, regardless of accuracy) Email (using school- provided and secure student and teacher email addresses) or upload photos of completed assignments, projects, or videos of activities (such as PE) in a secure portal (Question 10) Collec tion and Verification of Attendance Data LEA G will take the following steps to track student attendance: Advisory teachers will log daily attendance following the Zoom advisory session that will take place on all synchronous and asynchronous days. All classroom teachers will also take attendance during synchronous classes or will enter attendance to document full or partial completion of more than 50% of an assignment during asynchronous learning. Advisors and teachers will enter attendance for the class p eriod into DeansList. This will automatically synch with PowerSchool. 59 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov The registrar, who serves as the attendance officer for LEA G , will review daily attendance records for all advisory and classroom sessions, and will make adjustments to the daily atte ndance as she would during the normal school year. This includes designating absences as excused or unexcused after reviewing parent communications, revising daily attendance to present if a student missed advisory but was marked present for all classes du ring synchronous or asynchronous learning days, and documenting any disciplinary actions which would result in a student missing a day of instruction. LEA G will take the following actions to address absences: Advisors will be alerted if a student is abs ent for two consecutive days and make a phone call home. If absences persist, administrators and counseling staff will be assigned cohorts of students for follow -up from the primary building attendance administrator. Teachers will contact absent students and families by email and phone to determine reason for absence and determine what's needed to ensure future attendance. Students who meet the definition of chronically absent will be reported to child and family services, as required by law. The table below outlines the standards by which a student is marked present, partially present, or absent for a given school day. All of this data will be maintained within our PowerSchool system, printed on report cards, and can be furnished to OSSE as need ed in the event of an audit of attendance records: On-site synchronous On-site asynchronous Remote synchronous Remote asynchronous Present Present: Student attends school for >80% of the school day. OR Attends <80% of school day on -site AND is remote learning for the remainder of the school day. Present: Student attends school for >80% of the school day. OR Attends <80% of school day on -site AND all assignments due for day are completed. Present Remote: Student presence is detected throughout sc hool day's activities (A) captured in LMS (B) participates by one or more of the following touchpoints: is \"seen\" in virtual classroom, submits exit ticket participates in group activities Present Remote: Student attends advisory Zoom AND fully or partially completes >50% of the day's assignments. Student logs in to LMS and fully or partially completes >50% of the day's assignments. 60 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov participates in community building activities (games, etc.) Submits photo of student work Submits video of activity (e.g. PE, music) Saves student work in file, showing some progress Responds to documented contact(s) from a counselor, administrator, dean, and/or content teacher Student responds to documented contact(s) from a counselor, administrator, dean, and/or content teacher Partial Day Present Partial Present: Student attends school for <80% of the school day and is not captured in remote touchpoints when physically absent. Partial Present: Student attends school for <80% of the school day and is not cap tured through remote touchpoints when absent. N/A N/A Absent Absent: Student is not on-site during the school day and is not captured in Remote Touchpoints. Absent: Student is not on-site during the school day and is not captured in Remote Touchpoints. Absent Remote: Student is not captured in any of the remote touchpoints AND does not meet remote asynchronous touchpoints. Absent Remote: Student does not produce evidence that assignments are partially complete. Students in our Middle and Upper School who are learning synchronously remotely will receive the following: A text alert via DeansList to get up for the day for advisory. An email or text alert from DeansList if the student is marked absent for advisory, which will also b e sent to parents/guardians. A call from the registrar if the student is marked absent for advisory and has also been marked absent for the first period class of the day. 61 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Collecting and Reporting System The school will log all contacts with a student and family using DeansList. For students who are marked \"absent,\" the school's in -person attendance policy with consequences will be followed for reporting requirements and attendance verification. LEA H (Question 9 ) Option A (LEA using LMS for distance learning. ) LEA H utilizes Schoology to capture engagement with instructional materials virtually. Touchpoints that LEA H will use to determine remote attendance include the following methods: Direct \"face -to-face\" online contact through class Google Hangout or Zoom Completed exit tickets either on the class's curriculum platform, Schoology, or other software (such as Nearpo d) that provides demonstration of similar completion of work. Completed assignments submitted via Schoology from daily activity. Engaging with instructional materials housed on Schoology for the predetermined amount of time. (Question 10) Attendance Monitoring and Reporting LEA H will take the following steps to track student attendance: o Teachers are responsible for daily attendance for students on -site and will follow existing attendance protocols. o The LEA H Data Manager will enter attendance for students learning remotely using the following criteria: PreK: Logging into Schoology at least once each day K-3: Logging into Schoology at least once each day and at least one additional touchpoint (turning in an assignment/exit ticket and/ or spending at least 60 minutes engaging in working on materials on Schoology and/or attending at least one live class that day) 4-8: Logging into Schoology at least once each day and at least two additional touchpoints each day (turning in an assignment/e xit ticket and/or spending at least 120 minutes engaging in working on materials on Schoology and/or attending at least one live class that day) o The Data Manager is responsible for entering attendance data the next business day for data pulled from Schoolo gy so that we capture attendance for both synchronous and asynchronous remote learning students. For students that are marked present by attending live classes, the classroom teacher is responsible for updating attendance in PowerSchool at the end of the i nstructional day. 62 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov LEA H will take the following actions to address absences: o Teachers, counseling staff, and attendance staff will be assigned cohorts of students for follow -up from the Data Manager. o Teachers and other staff members will contact absent stu dents and families by email and phone to determine reason for absence and determine what's needed to ensure future attendance. o Students who meet the definition of chronically absent will be reported to child and family services, as required by law.

Partial Day Present Student attends school for less than 80% of the school day and does not meet the criteria to be marked remote present. N/A Absent Student is not on -site during the school day and does not meet the criteria to be marked remote present. Student does not meet the above criteria to be marked remote present. The families of elementary and middle school students who are learning remotely will receive the following: A robo reminder call to get ready for school. Text message reminders containing the schedule for the day A robo call to the family notifying them of the student's absence from school. Students with a history of absences may receive additional interventions, including phone calls from teachers and engagement specialists unti l a pattern of good attendance is achieved. If a student experiences a technology problem that inhibits them from being able to participate in virtual learning for more than one day: The family must reach out to the homeroom teacher The homeroom teacher will contact the attendance team to inform them that the student will be absent until the technology issue can be resolved. While the technical issues are occurring, the teacher will reach out to that family directly each day to discuss the day's learning. A touchpoint for that day would be a phone conversation with the student to discuss the day's learning and provide assistance on the assignments for that day. The teacher will log the communication in DeansList and email the data manager as further docume ntation of the call placed to the student. Students will receive excused absences until they can restart daily virtual education The attendance team will work with the homeroom teacher to follow- up and see if the missed work is completed asynchronously. If it is successfully completed, this will be logged, and the attendance code will be updated to present. 64 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Whole Student Support Question 11. Describe the LEA 's plan for supporting students social -emotional and mental health needs during continuous learning and school recovery. Also describe how, during your planning, the LEA will identify and provide academic intervention to students who have lost the mos t learning due to COVID -19. Sample Responses Despite the numerous other concerns LEAs must plan for in their continuous education plans, LEA I and LEA J both shared responses for whole student support that were considerate of the realities being faced by students and how they can manifest in the learning environment. LEA I outlined a comprehensive plan for supporting students that demonstrated integration and alignment with the LEA's trauma- responsive initiative , while LEA J provided detailed description s of SEL and academic intervention programs that included the daily schedule for student social -emotional connections and the academic intervention session structure. LEA Detail LEA Name LEA Response LEA I Social -Emotional and Mental Health - Trauma -Responsive Practices Before this pandemic, LEA I was committed to trauma -responsive practices for all students and continues to prioritize trauma treatment and practices as we prepare for school year 20 -21. Schools were readied to implement LEA I' s Trauma Responsive Schools (TRS) model via several profe ssional development opportunities. Schools were specifically charged with developing re -opening and recovery plans that emphasize Relationships, Routines and Resilience. To that end, each school will demonstrate evidence in their plans for how they will im plement \"Five Non -Negotiables\". 1. Every teacher spends dedicated time with their classroom or homeroom students to build relational trust. 2. Every student is greeted with positive and affirmative language daily and with each classroom transition. 3. Every school should include opportunities for staff wellness. 4. Every school provides opportunities and designated space to practice emotional regulation. 5. Every school teaches, models, and reinforces school- wide behavior expectations for students and adults. Schools hav e received professional development on how to implement these strategies both in person and virtually. The School Mental Health Team and the Social Emotional Learning Team will provide technical support to schools throughout the school year to ensure that the strategies are being implemented to promote recovery. 65 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov In addition, school -based mental health teams will continue to support students at all levels of need. The School Mental Health Team offers 19 Evidenced Based Treatments and Practices (EBT's) to in clude trauma- focused interventions for students of all ages. School mental health providers will be trained on completing assessments using a trauma informed lens at the start of this school year. Academic Interventions Our approach to providing instruct ion in response to unfinished learning in the SY19 -20 year begins with designing updated scope and sequences for our tier 1 classes that address these missed standards and topics through organic integration into the SY20 -21 scope and sequences for our cour ses. Additionally, we have embedded frequent checks for mastery within the curriculum as an effort to support teachers with identifying student learning gaps early in order to frequently maintain a pulse of content acquisition and provide differentiated an d responsive instruction. For students who demonstrate the most significant academic needs, academic intervention plans are created within schools that clearly identify learning gaps, appropriate interventions to address these gaps, and structured methods to monitor and respond to student progress. LEA J Student Support At LEA J , our primary core value is Relationships - \"I am my brother's keeper.\" and as such we continue practice distance compliance as we engage the work of building, maintaining and leveraging relationships to impact outcomes for the young male scholars that we serve. The surveying and interviewing that we did with our families before, during and after COVID -19 school closure started deeply informed our program. Ment al Health, emotional wellness and relational connection were all at the top of the list for parents and students. There was a great concern that the deep connections that the students had to their teachers would be lost. Using the Panorama data, which indicates that our students rank in the top 10% of schools across the nation when it comes to connectedness to their teachers, we instituted North Star Advisories to support in maintaining strong relationships. Each students pictu re was placed on the wall and the entire staff did a gallery walk leaving post -it notes on the faces of students that they felt a special bond with. We found that every LEA J was more than covered. We used that data to create 5 student pods that would be a nchored by each staff member. North Star Advisories meet in a Zoom Check -in every morning and engage in 5 of 20 different relational activities each day North Star Advisories create their own path of engagement each day and have members of the pod lead various activities North Star Advisors execute a one -on-one call or recorded Zoom check -in with each member of the group each day 66 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Student receive between 2 and 5 personal outreach contacts from their advisor or other LEA J team member each day Parents receive 2 to 5 personal outreach contacts from their advisor or other LEA J team member each week Each day, students will participate in a series of whole group gatherings to support on -time engagement in classes, bring positive energy into the day, engage in tea m building and mindfulness activities and celebrate the success that students have had in the day before o Sunrise Whole Group Gathering o Virtual Lunch/Electives o Midday Whole Group Gathering o Sunset Whole Group Gathering Wednesday Mornings are an extended Sunr ise session where more of the relational activities can be engaged in both the whole space, breakout rooms and when they break into their relational Crews Again, students may also choose to engage in Office Hours that will be available each day Each day, a t the Sunrise session, students engage in a series of queries regarding their emotional level and teachers use these self -reported levels to connect with students to create opportunities for them to process their emotions and connect students in seeming em otional distress with the School Counselor Just-In-Time Recovery The program as it is designed has demonstrated an ability to support every kind of learner. The MAP results at the end of Spring were not what we wanted, but certainly more than would have been expected. We are doubling down on what worked. Students who are demonstrating the slowest growth and greatest loss will be targeted for support during the times when students are released to independent work. These students will receive one- on-one and small group support in completing assignments. Additionally , SWDs and struggling learners will be a part of a pilot of Read 180, a partnership that we are enrolled in through a SOAR grant given to the Special Education Collaborative. This program will pro vide additional recovery for students with the slowest growth and greatest losses. We engage Acute Academic Intervention and will more deliberately implement this methodology in the virtual space as well: Exit tickets analyzed Students grouped by misconception 15 to 30 -minute skill specific instruction provided Exit ticket administered again A structure like this has been a part of the general academic program at LEA J , showing particular effectiveness for SWDs and struggling learners. 67 1050 First St. NE , DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Behavior Question 12. Describe the LEA 's policy for monitoring student behavior during distance learning. All parts of the distance learning discipline policy must be compliant with applicable local and federal law (e.g., limits on total days excluded, restrictions on reasons a student may be excluded). Your policy must include: A list of behaviors that could result in a student being excluded from distance learning (e.g., inappropriate conduct on virt ual platforms); The manner in which the LEA will comm unicate with families of students who are excluded from distance learning; and The manner in which you will ensure that students who are excluded from distance learning have access to missed work. Sample Responses Both of the LEAs selected here submitted responses that were thoughtful of the needs of teachers, students, and families in creat ing a safe learning environment ; though these stakeholders' concerns can be difficult to balance , both LEAs outlined clear processes for responding to instances of misbehavior and patterns of ongoing disruption without excluding students. LEA K included detailed information on distance learning behaviors that could result in an exclusion , how parents and families would be informed of a stud ent's misbehavior and/or disciplinary action , and potential modifications to virtual learning . LEA L outlined very clear expectations for behavior. For anticipated behavioral infractions, LEA L outlined a progressive sequence of interventions that would take place , ranging from parent conferences to the adjust ment of virtual learning settings, each of which demonstrate the LEAs' commitment to ensur ing that student access to education is consistent with local law. LEA Detail LEA Name LEA Response LEA K Expected behavior for students who are learning virtually are similar to those for the physical school community. Students are expected to treat their teachers, classmates, staff, and physical and virtual environment with respect. The virtual learnin g environment requires additional expectations to ensure that students have a safe, high quality learning experience while outside of the school building. The details below apply to expectations whenever students are engaged in virtual learning.

Describe the LEA 's plan to serve Students with Disabilities, including: A description of how the LEA is maintaining IDEA timelines in collaboration with families and documenting delivered services; The steps the LEA is taking to ensure that family members with disabilities (e.g. a guardian with visual impairment) can access c ontent to support their students learning; The manner in which LEA deliver related services for students in distance learning; The manner in which the LEA will support parent training for students receiving related services through distance learning; The manner in which LEAs will deliver recovery services to students with disabilities during the 2020 -21 school year and how LEAs will communicate those services to families; The steps LEAs will take to ensure that students with disabilities are assessed upon return to school to determine the nature and severity of the impact of learning loss on their receipt of educational benefit; and The steps LEAs will take to support the delivery of recovery services to students in the care of the District of Columbia and s tudents experiencing homelessness. Sample Responses LEA M shared e xtensive information on success es in service delivery in the 201 9-20 school year that will be carried over for the current year, as well as parent engagement practices designed to meet family needs in areas of flexibility, transparency, and training. LEA M 's submission also p rovide d a clear recovery planning framework for students with disabilities. LEA N focus ed on parent training and support and include d a robust discussion of ongoing service delivery in conjunction with recovery services. The response also t ouched on key training points from the OSSE training series and toolkit usage. Overall, the plan s how ed an understanding of how to operationalize flexibility under IDEA, emphasized the importance of parent engagement and training, and outline d intentional routines to meet requirements of the assurances. LEA Detail LEA Name LEA Response LEA M This submission is a narrative to demonstrate how LEA M will meet the educational and social -emotional needs of students with disabilities and English learners. Students with Disabilities When schools had to close their doors in March 2020 LEA M was able to continue providing its special education services and maintain strong connections with families to keep them engaged and supported in their children's 74 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov goals and services throughout the remainder of the school year. All IEP meetings and evaluat ions were conducted virtually, as well as specialized instruction and therapies with contractors and the in -house Speech Language Therapist. The Inclusion Coordinator continued to document cases in the SEDS system and maintained regular communication with families. LEA M will continue to maintain all timelines and documentation requirements for the 20 -21 school year. The inclusion coordinator -maintained IDEA timelines in collaboration with families by communicating with them weeks prior to upcoming eligib ility or annual IEP reviews. Families were able to choose whether holding virtual meetings with the educational team was a suitable option for them or to postpone them until school reopened. All families received a thorough explanation of how postponing t he meeting could impact their child's education through the impact that could have on therapies or being able to review their current IEP goals. LEA M families eagerly participated in all meetings, and in their child's subsequent virtual therapies. There was one exception in which an evaluation had begun before the school closing and there was no possibility for an in -person session to complete it. In that case, the family was informed and agreed to postpone the evaluation until school reopened. A Prior Wri tten Notice was completed and documented in SEDS regarding the conversation and agreement with the parent to postpone the evaluation until it could be carried out in person. All related services delivered virtually during the COVID -19 school closing were regularly documented in the SEDS system. Each therapist continued to use service trackers to document their sessions with students. The service trackers included notes about the different ways in which services were being delivered (i.e., Zoom meetings, texts, video links, pictures between parent and therapists to supplement sessions) as well as the parent coaching component that was a principal element of success in serving LEA M students with disabilities during remote learning. Eligibility and IEP m eeting documents were generated and subsequently uploaded in SEDS. All meetings during remote learning were done by conference call with prior permission from the parent, and included members of the child's educational team: general education teacher, spec ial education teacher, therapist, parent, LEA representative, and a representative who could interpret the results of evaluations. LEA M delivered laptops with touchscreens to 95% of children with IEPs in spring 2020 and the IT team ensured each family h ad the internet capability and support needed to be able to access all educational services. As we did in the Spring, we will continue to provide accessible assistance for parents on how to get the applications and links that are needed for services, and h ow to connect and download any necessary information. In the case of a parent with a visual impairment our technology team works with vendors to purchase add -ons and use technology to 75 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov provide accessibility. The only reason that 100% of children with IEPs did not receive laptops is that one family refused the device stating that they already had the devices needed. We utilized multiple modalities and mediums for communication including phone calls, video chats, written communication, postal deliveries, an d home deliveries of hands -on materials to use for meeting learning goals. We ensure that communication is provided in the way that the parent can receive it and collaborate with the Student Services team to ensure that parents of students with disabilities who also have medical or therapeutic needs can access services and support themselves. LEA M's strategic partnership with Mary's Center, a Federally Qualified Health Center with wraparound services has been integral in meeting a variety of adult as well as child needs. There were frequent follow up calls and meetings with parents of students with disabilities between the Special Education Coordinator and teachers to ensure that all content provided from specialists could be extended and embedded into some of the home learning activities and that parents were fully informed and supportive of the methodologies being used and how to monitor progress. LEA M was able to start remote learning in March 2020 with the right ingredients for effective special education services for students with disabilities experiencing the school closure in Spring 2020 and will be able leverage those same successes, combined with staff and parent feedback to deliver even more robust services in 20 -21. Although online learning is t ypically not the ideal learning modality for young children, LEA M 's students with IEPs were able to continue to thrive and meet their goals during this time. Although having children at home full time is less than ideal for parents and their schedules, th e therapists and teachers were able to make the most of this situation by providing additional parent training. Parents had a daily view of what these services looked like and the strong relationships that they already had with staff contributed to the suc cess of the model. Now that we have considerable experience in providing therapies and services in remote settings and parents have experienced them alongside their children they will be equipped and informed to make the choice between our hybrid model or virtual options. We will continue to engage in frequent communication including many texts, pictures, visuals, video chats, and meetings with special education teachers. LEA M will carry over the most successful parent training methods from Spring 2020 into 20 -21 such as video chats, phone calls, and individual sessions that focus on use of the materials that the school provides to them. The personal relationships that were formed between inclusion teachers and parents will continue and for new students the same elements and step by step process that LEA M has developed to attain meaningful family engagement and bi -directional communication will be implemented. Furthermore, the parents of LEA M children are enrolled in adult education classes in LEA M 's tw o generation school and receive robust parent training throughout the whole school year that covers all areas of child development. 76 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov LEA M will utilize developmental screening, and other forms of data collection including meetings with each child's educat ional team to decide on the best way to deliver necessary recovery services to students with disabilities during the 2020 -2021 school year. Parents will be part of the decision and the process of determining the most appropriate method to deliver recovery services for their children. The educational team that will collaborate to make the decision along with the parent includes therapists, a special education teacher, general education teachers, and the inclusion coordinator/case manager. LEA M plans to offer parents the following options to deliver recovery services during the 2020 -2021 school year: Temporarily adding time to the child's IEP for related services for period depending on progress that is documented during the first eight weeks of school after the change of service hours. Parents will have the option of choosing in person or virtual delivery of related services for their child. Providing extra parent coaching with supplemental activities and materials for home on a weekly basis that specifically targets the child's IEP goals (in person at school, and/or during virtual distance learning sessions). The special education team will collect and utilize information from various data sources during the first six weeks of school to be able to determine if a student with disabilities needs recovery services and/or to what extent the student needs such services. The inclusion coordinator will work in collaboration with parents, special education teachers, general education teachers, and thera pists to be able to have a clear picture of the child's current levels of performance as it relates to their IEP goals. The Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ -3) screener will also be used to better assess the child in all developmental areas along with pa rent input. LEA M will accommodate students with disabilities. LEA M will acquire the necessary equipment for students with physical disabilities such as special chairs and desks (for onsite learning), touch screen laptops, assistive technology, audio te xtbooks, educational software, and specialized cell phone applications, as appropriate. LEA M will administer the Empire State Screen: Learning Needs Screen for Non -English -Speaking Adults, a learning disabilities screen, to LEA M students to determine their learning needs and whether they could be referred for additional diagnostic assessment. A Learning Information Survey is also administered to determine in class learning needs and preferences. In cases where additional information is needed, the Learnin g Needs Screening tool and English Language Learner Student Learning Information Questionnaire are administered. All teachers are trained to provide appropriate and differentiated instruction. Learners who are struggling in class and whose screener indicat es they need additional diagnostic testing will be referred to Assess for Success which is coordinated by the OSSE Adult and Family Education office. LEA M will work with the diagnosticians to include critical information in the report that will help with the students' college and career pathways. The diagnostic results will be used to get the student 77 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov accommodations such as extended time on required assessments. Diagnosticians may also suggest classroom accommodations such as recording lectures, large print , oral and written directions, extended time for assignments, and quiet testing spaces. Finally, LEA M will request that the diagnostic reports include suggestions for workplace accommodations that would benefit the learner to ensure improved performance a nd completion of assignments such as oral and written directions, modeling of tasks to be completed, and quiet work space for individual tasks. LEA M will set, communicate, and ensure high expectations for students with disabilities. LEA M will have bui lt-in structures to better meet the academic needs of students. LEA M will provide a tutoring program. Tutoring will be provided to learners struggling to meet academic outcomes Reading strategies will be reviewed in class. LEA M 's Homelessness Liaison will continue to serve as the point of contact for documenting and advocating for LEA M families who are experiencing homelessness in order to ensure they receive appropriate accommodations under the McKinney -Vento Law. For LEA M families, this will include PreK student access to early intervention services; the rights of PreK and school- age children to continue their education in their \"school of origin\" and access to transportation to and from school. In addition to ensuring LEA M provides these and other support services, our Homelessness Liaison will also collaborate with Liaisons at other schools where the children of LEA M adult students attend. Staff from our administrative and student services teams will work directly with fam ilies in this category and will share all relevant information with our Homelessness Liaison. LEA N 1. LEA N will continue collaborating with families to find mutually agreeable times to hold IEP and eligibility meetings to ensure compliance with IDEA timelines. Communications with families will be documented internally, via Prior Written Notices, and in the communications log in SEDs. Service delivery will be documented in SEDS under related service session notes. 2. LEA N is conducting individual meetin gs with each student and family prior to the start of the school year. During these initial conversations, LEA N staff will assess any unique needs of each family, focusing on those with specific disabilities that require modifications to communicate and/ or access learning platforms. LEA N Principals and campus leadership teams will train all teachers on how to effectively assess needs of families during these conversations. Based on the needs assessed at the start of the school year, the Teacher and Speci al Education Coordinator, in partnership with their Principal if necessary, will establish specific communication protocols for individual family members with specific needs. 3. LEA N will deliver related services as outlined on a student's IEP, to the great est extend possible, in a remote, online setting. Sessions will be documented in SEDS under related service session notes. 78 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov 4. LEA N will conduct regular and responsive parent training sessions, including family orientations and individual student/ family mee tings to ensure that parents/ caregivers are prepared to reinforce and transfer skills with teachers and/ or service providers. Training will be provided remotely through an online video conferencing platform. These training sessions will be conducted both prior to the start of school and during the entire period of remote learning. 5. LEA N will deliver recovery services in asynchronous and synchronous formats that allow students to participate in general education whole group instruction, general education small group instruction, and specialized instruction services delivered in the manner most appropriate to the students' needs. Students may receive individual or small group specialized instruction. 6. Prior to the start of the school year, Special Education Coordinators will notify families of the overall service delivery plan with timelines that outline additional rounds of communication from teachers and related service providers to schedule services. LEA N teachers and related service providers will collaborate with families to determine a mutually agreeable time to deliver remote instruction within the overall LEA N instructional delivery model. Specialized instruction will be delivered, to the greatest extent possible, through small group and/ or individ ual sessions focused on ensuring student access to the general education curriculum and particular focus on student IEP goals. 7. All of LEA N 's students will be assessed at the beginning of the school year remotely. LEA N 's students with disabilities will be assessed through the whole school assessment process to set a baseline for progress monitoring throughout the school year. This data will be analyzed alongside assessment and anecdotal data collected during the period of remote learning that took place from March 16, 2020 through May 29, 2020. The data analysis, teacher input and parent input on remote learning effectiveness will allow LEA N to determine the severity of the impact of learning loss due to the ongoing pan demic. Special education data will be compared to general education data to determine the rate of learning loss across all students. 8. LEA N will conduct additional outreach to families experiencing homelessness and those in the care of the District of Colu mbia to ensure that the remote learning plan is accessible. Accommodations including provision of technology or phone -based instruction will be considered to ensure participation and access to learning during this additional period of remote learning. 79 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov English Learners Question 14. Describe the LEA's plan to serve ELs, including: A description of the EL program model and how it will maintain fidelity across in - person, distance learning and hybrid learning environments; The manner in which the LEA will set language goals across the four language domains of reading, writing, listening, and speaking to advance your EL students' English proficiency; The manner in which the LEA will provide language instruction in reading, writing, listening, and speaking to EL students during distance learning/hybrid learning environments by grade and by proficiency level; and The manner in which the LEA will provide EL students access to academic content by grade and proficiency level. Sample Responses LEA O's responses demon strate d a well- defined program and plan to support English learning in developing English language proficiency and meaningful participation in academic programs. The response addresses how all teachers will be coached to improve their ability to serve Engl ish learners ( ELs) and how LEA O will provide language access and initiate partnership with families of ELs capacity building. LEA P began by expressing it s values celebrat ing multilingualism and describ ing a welcoming environment for EL students. The LEA provided extensive detail on their selected program model (SIOP), EL staffing, and professional development for staff on serving E Ls and demonstrated a high level of consideration for the language developme nt needs of EL students . LEA Detail LEA Name LEA Response LEA O Identification and screening During distance learning, LEA O will continue to follow OSSE EL policy as it relates to the identification and screening of ELs. Most of our LEA O EL students are returning students or, if new, have previously attended schools in the OSSE system. Therefore, we have their EL data via the Early Access to EL Data Application in Qlik. We are currently using Early Access data to place new students already in the system in the appropriate EL classes within our program. In the case of students who are new to the system, our school enrollment pr ocess includes the administration of the Home Language Survey. If potential ELs are identified via the Home Language Survey, we will utilize the WIDA online screening assessment in order to determine the student's EL status and ACCESS level and place them accordingly. Program model 80 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov LEA O EL service model will continue in full operation during SY20 -21. Our model consists of a combination of English Language Development (ELD) courses, EL co -taught courses, native/heritage language instruction, and EL case management and capacity -building, a s follows: ELD courses: We will offer four ELD courses, three in middle school and one in high school, to ELs with ACCESS scores from 1 to 4.4. These classes are specifically designed to support students' academic language development needs in the four lan guage domains: reading, writing, listening, and speaking. Based on an analysis of our LEA O curriculum language demands, SY2020 -21 ELD units of study will match or complement units of study in ELA, science and social studies classes. This will ensure that ELs are learning the academic language skills that they will need to be successful in their core academic subjects. These classes will be taught online, utilizing synchronous and asynchronous delivery methods and high -quality EL materials created by our teachers based on various curriculum resources. EL co -taught courses: Last school year we launched EL -ELA co -taught classes in selected grades with good results. During the 2020 -21 school year, based on our analysis of ACCESS and grade data, we are expandin g our EL co -taught classes. In total, we will offer 10 co -taught classes in ELA, math, and science in selected grades, based on student linguistic needs. In these classes, content teachers and EL teachers will work together to make sure ELs receive linguis tic accommodations and differentiation, during synchronous and asynchronous instruction, so that they can fully access the curriculum and successfully engage in grade -level academic tasks. Co-teaching responsibilities include adapting lessons and assignmen ts and providing small group instruction to ELs and other students with academic language needs during classes and tutoring students, as needed, during EL teachers' office hours on Fridays. We are in the process of developing clearer expectations and trai ning for co-teachers based on lessons learned from last year's implementation, before and after the implementation distance learning, and current research on EL co -teaching, Native language instruction: The great majority of our Spanish -speaking ELs will also take intermediate or advanced Spanish courses via synchronous and asynchronous instruction. These courses allow our Spanish - speaking ELs to develop academic language in their native or heritage language. Research shows that providing rigorous first/he ritage language instruction not only fosters high levels of bilingualism, but also allows students to develop metalinguistic awareness essential to learning languages. EL Case Management: Each of our four EL educators will case manage approximately forty E L students. Each case manager will be assigned certain grade(s) in order to promote collaboration with general education grade level teams. Case managers will: o Work with students to analyze their ACCESS data and classes' grades and set SMART language development goals 81 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov o Conduct one -on-one check -ins with EL students to monitor their emotional well -being, ensure engagement in online learning and academic progress, and provide/coordinate supports, as needed. Check -ins were piloted last school year with positive results. o Work with general education and special educators of ELs in their caseload to ensure linguistic accommodation are implemented across the curriculum. EL Capacity Building: Finally, we are committed to ensuring that both our EL core team and every educator at LEA O increase their capacity to appropriately serve ELs. With this goal in mind we will implement the following actions: o Our Director of Language Learning and one of our instructional coaches will work closely with our EL teachers, via weekly coaching and check -ins, to make sure that ELD and co -taught lessons are both rigorous and accessible to students and utilize language instruction best -practices. o This summer, 4 EL educators and 8 general education teachers across content a reas and grade levels are participating in WIDA online self- paced workshops to increase their capacity to serve ELs. o EL teachers and the Director of Language Learning will organize PD workshops, co -planning sessions and consultations focused on how to sca ffold and differentiate lessons/assignments for ELs, depending on student and teacher needs. The manner in which the LEA will set language goals across the four language domains of reading, writing, listening, and speaking to advance your EL students' En glish proficiency; In order to facilitate EL case management, communication with students and families, and ensure that each student has clear linguistic goals they are working on, we are in the process of developing an EL Individualized Learning Plan (IL P) template. We are utilizing models provided by OSSE and the DC Public Charter School Board to design the EL ILP that will best fit our students and faculty's needs. This tool will most likely contain the student's ACCESS scores, key background informatio n, language strengths and needs, and SMART language development goals set in collaboration with EL students. Each EL teacher will meet individually with the ELs in their case management load during the first four weeks to build relationships, review their latest ACCESS data, identify their strengths and needs, and develop SMART language goals. During the remainder of the year, periodic check -ins will be conducted to monitor students' progress towards their goals and set up action steps to support students. Training and a calendar will be provided to EL educators to ensure that the EL Individualized Learning Plan, and the goal setting and monitoring processes are done with fidelity. The manner in which the LEA will provide language instruction in reading, writing, listening, and speaking to EL students during distance learning/hybrid learning environments by grade and by proficiency level; and 82 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov All students who scored 4.4 or below in ACCESS, in all grades, will receive instruction in social and academic reading, writing, listening and speaking skills in their ELD courses and co -taught classes, as described above. Furthermore, our ELD courses will teach lessons aligned to key academic language demands of LEA O 's content courses, in the four language domains. Additionally, our IB curriculum focused on inquiry -based instruction and using content knowledge in authentic ways. Thus, in every content are a, units integrate reading, writing, listening and speaking tasks to the benefit of ELs. The manner in which the LEA will provide EL students access to academic content by grade and proficiency level. As mentioned above the curriculum for ELD classes a re being developed based on the proficiency levels of students and the language demands of their core content classes (ELA, science and social studies). This approach will support student access to academic content. Additionally, co -taught classes will ens ure all ELs with ACCESS scores 4.4 and below receive linguistic accommodations and small group instruction by co -teaching EL teachers. Access to academic content for students with higher English proficiency (4.5 to 5 in ACCESS) will be supported through EL case management and EL capacity building (co -planning, coaching and consultation), as needed. Linguistically accessible and culturally competent communication with families LEA O is committed to communicating with families in a language they understan d, to the extent practicable, in compliance with Title I and the Language Access Act. Additionally, our school understands that communication styles and preferences vary across linguistic and cultural communities and educators have to consider these variat ions in order to effectively communicate and partner with families. Since frequent communication with culturally and linguistically diverse families is even more important in the context of distance learning, we are continuing key language access strategie s and adding new ones: LEA O will continue to send all key communication to parents in both English and Spanish (distance learning policies, schedules, weekly parent online newsletter, report cards, curriculum updates, etc.) since Spanish is the most commo n heritage/world language spoken in our school community. LEA O will continue providing simultaneous interpretation (or a parallel Spanish meeting option) for key family meetings via Zoom and utilize the DC language line to support verbal translation of all other languages. LEA O will develop a Language Access hub where we will clearly outline expectations, protocols and resources for teachers to effectively communicate with parents whose dominant language is not English. Resources will include how to requ est translation/interpretation services from bilingual staff, how to use technology tools to translate/interpret, and bilingual email templates, among others. 83 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov LEA O will provide training to staff at the beginning of the school year on how to utilize the ne w Language Access hub, as well as culturally competent strategies to improve communication with culturally and linguistically diverse families. At the beginning of the school year, EL team will provide multilingual information to EL families about our LEA O EL programming during distance learning. During the first three weeks of school, EL Case Managers will send a video to families and call families of the ELs in their caseload to introduce themselves and learn more about them. In addition to student check ins, case managers will check -in with fami lies (via text, phone, video, and/or WhatsApp , meetings) in their preferred language, as needed. LEA P LEA P is an innovative new charter school set to open in the 2020 -2021 school year with a mission to foster pathways for young women to lead and learn. LEA P is dedicated to ensuring that all students have access to a high - quality education that will prepare th em for a multicultural, multilingual, and interconnected global world. Inclusive in LEA P 's model are assurances that English learners (ELs) will be adequately prepared and challenged. LEA P leadership has thought deeply and planned intentionally with the needs of English -learning students in mind. From its founding principles, to its instructional model, and community -building efforts, LEA P is committed to providing an equitable and appropriate education for all students. LEA P is excited to welcome a diverse mix of student s when it opens its doors next year; LEA P recognizes that its EL students bring important resources to the learning community. Their expertise in languages other than English as well as life experiences in countries and cultures outs ide of the US, are important parts of LEA P 's informal curriculum. LEA P recognizes that students come to school with a wealth of knowledge and experience on which to build their learning. Moreover, LEA P knows that student s' relationships in and amongst e ach other will provide important opportunities for learning and growing. The LEA P climate will be one where all student s are honored and celebrated regardless of home language, race, ethnicity, culture, income, life experience, gender, or sexual orientati on. This supplemental EL plan details LEA P 's approach to meeting the specific needs of its EL students through a comprehensive educational approach, instructional resources, remedial support, staffing, and family engagement. Educational Approach Language Acquisition Model: The language acquisition model at LEA P is sheltered content instruction which emphasizes simultaneous language and content instruction. LEA P selected this model because it is the most equitable means of delivering hig h quality instruction to ELs. Sheltered instruction maintains ELs' inclusion in content area classes so that they have maximum interaction with and exposure to content teachers and 84 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov English proficient peers. LEA P staff will be trained on the Sheltered Inst ruction Observation Protocol (SIOP), a research -based model that has shown to be effective with ELs. SIOP has eight interrelated components: o Lesson Preparation o Building Background o Comprehensible Input o Strategies o Interaction o Practice/Application o Lesson Delivery o Review & Assessment Implementing SIOP starts during lesson planning where teachers plan with students' language needs in mind in order to consider what vocabulary, grammar, and discourse structures they will need to k now in order to access the content. Teachers also assess the need for any additional background knowledge development that is prerequisite to the main lesson. Throughout the lesson, teachers make modifications to their oral language as well as written supp ort to assure that input is comprehensible to all learners. Through sheltered content instruction, ELs have access to the same academic content as their English proficient peers and teachers employ intentional scaffolding to make content accessible to stud ents at all proficiency levels. In the sheltered classroom, teachers strategically employ homogenous and heterogenous groupings according to the learning tasks. Throughout the lesson and after, students are able to practice and apply new concepts in meanin gful contexts. Finally, the SIOP model fosters teachers' ability to reflect upon their learning to continually improve their practice and instruction for ELs. While sheltered instruction is LEA P 's primary language acquisition model, the EL teacher may elect to use pullout instruction for ELs on an as -needed basis depending upon her language proficiency level and academic progress. However, every attempt will be made to keep ELs in their content area classes as much as possible. All instructional staff will have opportunity to plan and organize quality content to present in multiple ways for ELs. Standards and Curriculum o All core content instruction at LEA P will be aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). Additionally, teachers will use the WIDA English Language Proficiency Standards and Can Do Descriptors to understand the academic language demands of their content areas as well as what ELs can be expected to do across different proficiency levels. In addition, when LEA P leadership were sel ecting curricula, they made sure to select ones that included a specific focus on English language development to ensure that all students would have access to the content. 85 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov International Baccalaureate Career Program o The International Baccalaureate (IB), a curriculum aimed at fostering \"international mindedness,\" independent thought, and cultural awareness, aligns with the mission of LEA P to foster pathways for young women to lead and learn. The International Baccalau reate Career Program (IBCP) is a unique hybrid that incorporates the educational vision and principles of IB with a focus on career- related learning. IBCP prepares students to enter apprenticeship programs, employment, and/or post- secondary education. IBCP 's foci on language learning, multiculturalism, and global perspectives, makes it a natural fit for students whose life experiences have included learning more than one language and living in more than one country like the lives of many ELs. o Figure 1 conta ins the WIDA and IB Integration Tool , a resource developed by WIDA that will guide LEA P 's approach to integrating the WDIA and IB frameworks. There are many complementary resources between the two frameworks that highlight their shared values. For instance, WIDA's Guiding Principles of Language Development and IB's Language Policy both emphasize that language learning is a process that occurs over time and that multilingualism is an asset rather than a challenge to overcome. (Figure 1 omitted in this document.) Advanced Placement Courses o LEA P is dedicated to supporting student s' success within a rigorous academic environment. Therefore, in addition to pr oviding IB courses, LEA P will also offer Advanced Placement (AP) coursework. Both IB & AP are focused on deeper learning and critical thinking and share a mutual emphasis on college and career readiness. LEA P believes in the potential of all students and does not want students who are still in the process of learning English to be deterred from engaging in advanced coursework. All LEA P courses will integrate our cross -cutting instructional methods (see below) to make content accessible to ELs. Cross -cutting Instructional Methods: LEA P teachers will employ several cross -cutting instructional methods in their classes with the necessary accommodations needed for their EL students. These include: o Inquiry -based learning -- a student -centered approach to le arning where students drive the exploration of content and teachers serve as facilitators of the exploratory process. In implementing inquiry -based learning with an EL, teachers will take the time to understand her interests and existing background knowled ge on the topic. The teacher will also scaffold the inquiry with her through the use of model questions, question stems, resources in the ELs' home language and English, visuals, and videos and other media. Throughout her inquiry, the EL will also be encou raged to use bilingual dictionaries and talk to experts on her topic who speak her home language. While all learning products will be completed in 86 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov English, ELs will be supported in using their home language to facilitate their learning as needed and using it as a bridge towards expression in English. o Discussion -based learning -- Paideia Seminar is an approach, similar to the Socratic Seminar, that uses open -ended questions about a text. To facilitate meaningful participation for ELs in class discussions, teachers will provide scaffolded texts to aid comprehension. In addition, ELs will have access to written versions of the discussion questions and sample sentence starters to use in forming their responses. ELs will also have opportunities to practice their responses with a peer or Graduate Fellow before engaging in a whole class discussion. o Service learning at LEA P will provide an opportunity for meaningful, experiential education for all students, including ELs. In considering potential service -learning opportunities, LEA P staff, in collaboration with EL students, will consider ELs' strengths and assets, including their language skills. o EL methods -- Once trained in SIOP, all teachers will be able to implement methods that allow ELs to access and comprehend course content. These methods include, but are not limited to, language scaffolding, making connections to E Ls' home languages, access to translation tools, peer learning, realia, visuals, graphic organizers, multimodal representation, increased wait time, and connections to prior knowledge. Math teachers will ensure that students, especially those designated as ELs will simultaneously acquire the required academic language of mathematics and mathematical concepts. This will be accomplished through many of the same strategies employed in English Language Arts -- pre- teaching vocabulary, using glossaries, represen ting language visually, providing multiple representations of math concepts, and providing opportunities to read and write about math. Instructional Resources o All content teachers, with the guidance and possible assistance from the EL teacher, will be responsible for modifying their classroom materials according to the proficiency levels and learning needs of their ELs. In aligning with the CCSS, WIDA, and SIOP, teachers will make sure that ELs are exposed to the same content as their English dominant peers but have the necessary supports needed to support their language development in tandem with their academic learning. This can include, but will not be limited to, additional background information, glossaries or glossed words, visuals, videos or other media, and translation. All students at LEA P will have access to an online language learning application (e.g., Duolingo) to advance their language skills. Rem edial Support o LEA P will implement Response to Intervention (RtI) as a means for identifying, monitoring, and intervening when students need additional support, including ELs. The RtI process will function within LEA P 's systematic 87 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov approach to collaborativ e data inquiry for school improvement -- Data Wise. Data Wise is a structured process for analyzing student data that follows four steps: (1) plan for data meetings, (2) discuss data, (3) review findings, and (4) commit to action. o LEA P believes that high -quality teaching, rigorous instruction, and differentiation are essential for all students. LEA P will take a proactive approach to intervention by providing instruction within a Universal Design for Learning model that contains appropriate support for al l students. For ELs, this includes the cross - cutting instructional methods mentioned above. If a student is not demonstrating sufficient progress, the student support team will, upon reviewing data, identify needs, create a plan for intervention, implement the plan, and track the student's progress during implementation. If the student continues to show limited progress, the student will receive increasingly intensive supports (moving from Tier 2 -3). Figure 2 contains a list of sample tiered supports within RtI. As the student demonstrates adequate progress, the team will either continue supports or fade out the supports if the student makes progress. If the student fails to respond to interventions, the school can make a referral for additional evaluation. Throughout the process, families will be notified of suggested interventions and invited to be part of action planning and progress monitoring conversations. LEA P will ensure intervention plans include explicit timelines, resources, and monitoring schedul es to ensure the team can quickly identify struggling students and effectively measure their progress. (Figure 2 omitted in this document) o in addition, LEA P recognizes that newcomer ELs and those with emerging English proficiency may need further support to be successful in the classroom. Principally, LEA P will foster a school culture where all are welcome, differences are seen as integral parts of everyone's learning, and staff are knowledgeable about students' home lives and cultures. LEA P leadership will assess newcomers' needs on a case by case basis but will have multiple resources to pull form in meeting her needs. Academic resources include, but are not limited to, tutoring and in class support from a graduate fellow, translation assistance, peer buddies, pull out ESL instruction. Staffing o LEA P will plan to open with at least a .5 EL Teacher but we will revisit this based on actual student enrollment. The EL teacher will support content area teachers in implementing SIOP including coteaching, modeling, and/or coaching, as needed. Depending upon students' proficiency levels and needs, she may also do occasional pullout with ELs. In addition, she will oversee LEA P 's graduate fellows who can also provide in class support for ELs as well as small group or one -on-one instruction. The student services coordinator will take care of the administrative load related to EL documentation and paperwork . o To fully implement sheltered instruction, staff and leadership will receive training on the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP). Content teacher s, instructional leaders, and the EL teacher will 88 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov attend this training together in order to foster a shared understanding and framework from which to approach EL instruction. Sheltered instruction may be delivered from a content teacher or through a co - teaching model between the EL and content teachers. In the instance that the content teacher is instructing in a sheltered environment, the EL teacher will support the teacher by co -planning, reviewing lesson plans and materials, and debriefing lessons. As ne w staff are hired at LEA P , leadership will assess their need for SIOP training. Ideally, the EL teacher could provide onsite follow on or induction training for LEA P staff. o In addition to SIOP training, LEA P staff will also receive training on the WIDA' s English language development standards so that they can use these standards for planning, instruction, and assessment. o In order to stay abreast of developments in the field of EL education, LEA P will support its EL teacher in attending local and natio nal conferences and training, including OSSE's annual Multilingual Learner Conference, the Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) Convention, and the Washington Area TESOL Conference. LEA P leadership will also create opportunities for the EL teacher to share take -aways with other staff from these conferences 89 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Technology NOTE : OSSE did not provide formal comments to public charter LEAs for these questions. Question 15. Describe the LEA's policy for technology use during distance learning, including: Expectations for student access to devices and technical training; The manner in which the LEA will assess student/family technology needs; The supports that will be provided to students who do not have access to internet or devices due to circumstances beyond their control; The plan for replacing/repairing devices; Expectations for student access to internet and safeguarding personally identifiable information (PII); What limitations, if any, you are putting on LEA device use at home (e.g., prohibiting social media, video games, etc.) and how you are enforcing them; and If/how the school's technology policy differs by grade level. Sample Responses The response from LEA Q was thorough and includ ed a commitment to support virtual learning 100% of the time, even if in -person options become available. In addition, the LEA demonstrated was conscious in noting that digital experience s should ideally includ e developmental considerations in addition to mo re straightforward technical support needs (e.g., \"We are also intentional about providing learners the opportunity to develop their fine motor skills through learning how to use a keyboard.\" ). LEA R content includ ed information on how the LEA intends to build emotional supports systems dur ing distance learning in addition to addressing IT logistics. The LEA also included good description s of the web site and content blocking policies and hardware and software measures they have taken to ensure student inte rnet security . LEA Detail LEA Name LEA Response LEA Q Commitment and Expectations LEA Q is committed to the effective use of technology to enhance the quality of learning and minimize any potential barriers families may encounter when accessing LEA Q learning platforms. As a new school opening its doors for the first time, LEA Q's technology planning has altered significantly to address the current COVID -19 landscape. Previously, LEA Q did not intend to rely heavily on the use of technology in the classrooms, rather as a compliment to learning. Additionally, individual use of technology was to be determined based on each learner's customized learning plan, developed in conjunction with each family, to establish goals and how learners would reach those 90 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov goals. As such, LEA Q was planning to equip each classroom with 3 -5 Chromebook s with additional capacity for MAP testing grades. Currently, LEA Q is committed to ensuring equitable acces s to technology resources for all learners as we consider potential virtual learning and at -home use of technology. Even if we offer in -person options, LEA Q will provide virtual learning 100% of the time. As such, LEA Q expects each learner to have access to a device and to the internet in order to access learning. We will work with each respective family to ensure they are equipped with the necessary materials to do so. Needs Assessment and Distribution As a new LEA, all LEA Q technology will be newly purchased, functioning optimally, and under warranty. Staff technology o All LEA Q full-time staff will be issued a new windows -based laptop on their first day. These laptops will be equipped with Google Suite, which allows for central administration. This central administration is key to regulate school- owned technology. More importantly, we can push out necessary applications that each staff member will use to execute LEA Q programming. Staff Training o Professional Development for all staff begins August 3. During this three -week period before the first day of school (August 31), staff will be trained in proper administration of all curricula and online platforms. As a school staff, we will train in how to lead remote learning. Learner technology o LEA Q is using Chromebook s for our hardware needs. These devices are compatible with the online platforms and applications that we will be using for remote learning. We are also intentional about providing learners the opportunity to develop their fine motor skills through learning how to use a keyboard. o We will start the year with 55 Chromebooks , 15 of which will have a touchscreen for our youngest population. This is a good start that will enable us to immedi ately address any device needs. We will also assess the needs of our entire enrolled population through this Google Form . In add ition to collecting information on which families need devices and the internet, it will also detail the various options to obtain said technology while explaining LEA Q support through this process. We will send this form out to all enrolled families and use it as part of enrollment intake going forward. We are offering families the option to purchase their own device - computer or internet hotspot (through special corpor ate or CBO 91 1050 First St. NE , DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov offers) or to borrow an LEA Q device, through agreeing to LEA Q 's technology use commitment to proper usage and liability. We are considering a cost sharing amount to make it easier for families to purchase their own technology and facilitate th e purchase of the device. Internet Essentials, through Xfinity, offers qualifying customers inexpensive monthly internet and options to purchase inexpensive computers. LEA Q has formed a partnership with PCs for People (based out of Minnesota) to procure Wi-Fi hotspots (and desktops) and internet at reduced prices. Families can purchase on their own (through LEA Q 's platform page) or work with the school to purchase on their behalf. Learner T raining o Where possible, learners will be expected to retrieve hotspots and devices at the school, where they will also receive training and expectations for proper use and care of equipment. For learners and families not able to retrieve equipment from the school, arrangements will be made for shipping or dropping off the equipment directly to the family. Training, expectations and care of equipment will be provided virtually in such cases. Replacing and repairing devices Every device that LEA Q has purchased includes Accidental Damage Protection warranty through the manufacturer with next day shipping. Our goal is to have extra Chromebooks for immediate exchanges in case a device needs to be repaired. We will ask that families bring their broken equipment to the school for any drop -off or exchange. LEA Q will have a device tracking list and a check -in/out list for the replacement devices. We will have a thorough technology use form that all parents and learners must agree t o and sign. This agreement will commit to proper use of the device and accept liability in the case of misuse or loss. We are still working through how to properly hold families accountable. Each Chromebook device will be centrally managed by school admini stration. As such, we are confident we can limit any misuse of software by only allowing for educational and LEA Q -related functions. Because of our tracking diligence, we will be able to keep track of repeat needs to repair or replace a device. In a situa tion in which one family needs a device repaired more than twice, we will call an in -person meeting to get to the root of the issue and determine where we can adequately aim our support to encourage proper device usage. Personally identifiable informatio n (PII) Devices issued to students by the school will have pre- installed software that is administered centrally and prevents students from accessing prohibited sites and allows school personnel to remotely login to the device, update its software or disable the device entirely. 92 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Limitations Equipment o As previously stated, LEA Q will have control over use of software and any other device use. We will allow hardware to be used by other family members as related to the education of their learner. If a piece of equipment goes missing, a family's responsibility is to inform the schoo l as soon as possible. Software o Software will require log in credentials. New software will not be allowed to be downloaded by a family. New software not purchased by the school will not be allowed onto the computer. We will restrict the use of the inter net to specific sites for educational programming, unless school leadership determines it is appropriate to allow for full use. In such a case, we will limit sites on a case -by-case basis. Training o Staff training will be held during Summer PD in August. Family training will be held virtually during our recurring School Opening Conversations with families. Learner training will be held at some point upon distributing devices to families. If a family needs support, there are many avenues. Their \"classroom\" teacher is the first line of support. Otherwise, they can call the p rincipal or director of o perations or anyone else on school leadership. LEA R Overview LEA R is committed to the effective use of technology to enhance both the quality of student learning and the efficiency of school operations. LEA R has always been a technologically minded school. The School understands that school -owned -and-operated technology is a necessary part of the learning process for all students especially during the 2020- 2021 school year. This technology policy assumes that students will be engaging in classes 100% virtually/remotely through November 6, 2020 and in a hybrid education model afterwards. Both models require all students to have a school Chromebook and mo bile hotspot. LEA R is committed to equitable access to technology resources necessary for learning for all students. Students (and where applicable, their families) must sign and submit a Student Technology Acceptable Use and Safety form prior to receivin g their equipment and devices. Beyond defining LEA R 's general policy on providing equitable access to technology and ensuring its safe use, this policy provides a series of steps to ensure a Return to School Technology Plan is in place. It includes training and support for teachers to adapt virtual learning skills for the classroom. Additionally, it will provide training in data 93 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov and cyber security to assist staff in understanding the risks and responsibilities associated with the new learning environment . Equipment, Software, Support, and Training Expectation for Students and Staff LEA R will provide all students and staff with the necessary technology equipment, software, and training to fully participate in distance learning as indicated in the inform ation below. LEA R conducted a detailed needs analysis of its technology program from the 2019 -2020 school year in order to develop a comprehensive technology plan to meet the needs of all of its stakeholders in the 2020 -2021 school year. Based on the 2019 -2020 needs analysis, a majority of LEA R 's students relied on school technology to engage in the school environment during the school closure caused by the pandemic. Therefore, the School has a 2:1 Chromebook program for all students to ensure students ha ve access to continuous learning both at home and at the school during the hybrid phase. During the 100% virtual/remote phase all students will receive a Chromebook and internet hotspot. As the school services grades 6 -8, all students will follow the same technology policy. Equipment All students of LEA R will receive a School Chromebook to take home with him or her the week of August 10th, and as needed, a hotspot and a calculator. Beyond the school Chromebook that will be kept at each student's home, the School will provide a Chromebook in the student's classroom for each student who participates in on -site learning. Each Chromebook will be set up and customized for each student and will be password protected so that the student's information is secure. Other family members are not permitted to use the School's Chromebook for personal use. All LEA R staff will receive a School Laptop, School iPad for all teachers, and as needed, a wireless mouse prior to the start of school on August 31, 2020. T eachers will also have the option of receiving a document camera if they elect to use this device. Software All students and staff will have access to the following software using school- created, and maintained, log- in and passwords. At no time will anyo ne outside of the school's community be able to access the software. The following table shows the various software being used at LEA R for in -person and distance learning programs: Software Who has access? PowerSchool Students and Staff (only select LEA R administrators have Admin access to PowerSchool) 94 1050 First St. NE , Washington, Students and Staff (student records will be stored securely and only accessible by admin) LEA R Email and Google Suite Students and Staff ( logins will be customized for each user; Google Admin is centrally located to protect student and staff privacy) ANET, NWEA, Nearpod Students and Staff (Student testing information is secure) ZoomPro, Swivl, DeansList, CommonLit, TCI, Google Remote Desktop Staff (only select LEA R staff will have access to Google Remote Desktop) Chrome Extensions: Chrome Vox, Mercury Reader, and Google Dictionary Students Hapara Select LEA R administrators have access to Hapara - used to monitor student web access and to limit which websites students have access to Google Remote Desktop Select LEA R technology team members will have access to Google Remote Desktop to provide remote troubleshooting support for students Training LEA R is providing training on all equipment and software for students and staff members.

The School will communicate to staff, students and families to contact the Technology Team for any needed technical assistance through emails, phone calls, website, print resources, and the School's app. If needed, a member of the Technology Team will provide additional training. The Technology Team consists of the Director of Distance Learning, Director of Operations, Business and Facilities Manager, and the Special Projects Assistant. If replacement equipment is needed, the School has additional equipment that can be swapped out to ensure there is no delay in lear ning. Review & Assessment: Assessing Need Within this section, LEA R will describe how we assessed the technology needs of our students and staff to ensure that all stakeholders can successfully participate in distance learning. Equipment LEA R has rev iewed staff equipment to make sure the equipment is in working order. LEA R conducted a staff technology survey in Spring 2020 to determine the technology needs of teachers and staff. For those teachers whose computers are not in working order, the teacher s will receive a new laptop and iPad when they return to school in August. Each classroom will also receive a Swivl, which will be used along with the iPad to livestream the classes (See Instructional Delivery Plan). Additionally, LEA R conducted a stud ent technology survey in Spring 2020 to determine the technology needs of students. Based on the survey responses, the School now has a 2:1 Chromebook program for all students when 98 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov students resume in -person classes, so students will have a School Chromeboo k both at home and at school. The School is keeping extra equipment on site for students and staff if they need to swap out their equipment. The School also has hotspots available to those students who do not have reliable internet at home and will be sent home with a hotspot along with their LEA R Chromebook. All students will have access to a hotspot. LEA R will continue to contact parents regarding the tech -related services and supports they need throughout the school year. Parents will receive an initial tech check in the week of August 31, 2020 (first week of school). Below is a chart outlining how the school will receive feedback from families/guardians throughout the school year.

If students or parents/guardians are unable to pick up the equipment from the school, a member of the Technology Team will coordinate with the paren t/guardian on how to best deliver the equipment, as well as providing a video recorded training along with a live ZoomPro support session. The Technology Team will also provide on -site scheduled appointments for individual students and parents/guardians fo r training on the equipment, as well as pre- recorded training videos housed on the School's website. For more information on what will be covered in the training sessions, please see the Training section under Equipment, Software, Support, Training Expectation for Students and Staff. Support Provided for Students without Access to Internet or Devices Based on multiple parent/guardian surveys (administered in March 2020 and July 2020), students without adequate internet or devices (Chromebooks) were identi fied. All students who needed a Chromebook were provided with a Chromebook in the Spring of 2020 and a mobile hotspot if needed. 102 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov During the expansion of distance learning in the 2019 -2020 school year, the School overhauled the technology program to ensu re all students have access to the required devices for distance learning. LEA R has a 2:1 student Chromebook program for the 2020 -2021 school year. Students will be given a School Chromebook to keep at home for all virtual learning. Additionally, students who are receiving in -person instruction when it is able to resume will have a dedicated School Chromebook that will be left at the school. This allows all students to have access to the necessary resources to experience a successful distance learning educ ation. Additionally, in July 2020, parents were surveyed regarding their preferred mode of learning for their student (100% in person, hybrid, or 100% virtual). Through this survey, incoming students without internet access or technology were identified. Those without internet access and devices will be provided a mobile hotspot to give internet access when the parent/guardian picks up the School Chromebook. As noted, all students will begin the school year as virtual students. Parents/guardians and st udents will pick up hotspots and devices at the school where they will also receive training and expectations for proper use and care of the equipment. For students and families not able to retrieve equipment from the school, arrangements will be made for dropping the equipment off to the student. As previously noted, student and family training will be covered upon Chromebook pick up prior to the summer bridge program. The training will include proper use and care, accessing software and troubleshooting, e xpectations, and care of equipment. During the virtual learning model, the School will provide virtual training sessions via Zoom and recorded virtual training sessions will be hosted on the School's website for on -demand access. Once the School can move to its hybrid phase, the School will provide in -person trainings following all health guidance and regulations. Replacing/Repairing Equipment Equipment o LEA R will have loaner equipment available for families and staff on an as -needed basis. If any of the School's equipment is broken, the parent/guardian must return the device on -site at the school. This will allow the School to provide a loaner device immediately so there is no lag time in learning. However, the parent/guardian must schedule a time to come up to the building in accordance with the School's visitor policy. In the event that a device is loaned, the parent/guardian must sign an Acknowledgement a nd Waiver form. Once the form is completed and signed, the parent/guardian will be given the loaner device for their student to use. 103 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov In the event that a device has been damaged due to misuse (i.e., eating over the computer, dropping the computer, accessin g unapproved websites, etc), the parent/guardian is financially responsible to replace the device. This is the same policy for the initial device the School will be giving to each student. In the event of a student having issues with a computer, a member of the Technology Team will provide telephonic troubleshooting to check if it is the equipment or software malfunctioning, or if it is a lack of training on the computer/software usage. If it is due to a lack of training or software not working, the School 's staff will be able to log in remotely on the student Chromebook to fix the device. However, if it is due to the equipment malfunctioning, the School will be able to provide a loaner device for the student to use. Software o If it is determined that soft ware is malfunctioning instead of the equipment, LEA R 's staff will troubleshoot remotely. However, if it is not possible for LEA R staff to troubleshoot the issue with the software, the School will partner with the contracted IT Provider for remote support. o The School's IT Provider will create the LEA R student accounts and passwords and ensure that these items are private. The passwords will be kept on a secure spreadsheet that will be shared with select members of the school staff. The students will be given their username and password before school starts, during the weeks of August 10thand August 17th. If a student forgets his or her password, the parent/guardian can contact the Technology Team, and a designated LEA R staff member will be able to unlock the student's or staff's account and provide ins tructions on how to reset a password. o If a student or staff member is locked out of his or her Google account, the staff member or parent/guardian should contact the Technology Team by submitting a ticket. In the instance that it is software that LEA R staff do not have access to, the IT Provider will be contacted to unlock accounts by LEA R staff. Training LEA R will provide an initial training between August 10thand August 21stfor parents and students when they are picking up their school Chromebook and other devices. For those families who experience repeated and/or severe issues with the equipment or software, the family will issue a ticket and the School will partner with the IT Provider to provide additional training or support. Staff w ill receive their training on equipment and software during the weeks of August 3rdthrough August 24th during Professional Development and Training Weeks 104 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov o If students or staff are experiencing any issues with equipment or software, they should contact the Technology Team. If there is an issue that the Technology Team cannot fix, the School will contact the IT Provider. Families will also receive a chart to help guide them the repair process. Expectations for student access to internet and safeguarding personally identifiable information (PII) The School has a robust system in place to ensure student access and personally identifiable information are safeguarded and protected. All school devices that are issued to students will have pre -installed softwar e that prevents students from accessing prohibited sites and also allows school staff or the IT Provider to remotely login to the device, update its software or disable the device entirely. Additionally, the School has various websites and content blocked, as well as a firewall to provide additional content filtering, intrusion protection, gateway antivirus and malware scanning and protection. LEA has also blocked certain categories, domains, and URLs to protect students . The School also utilizes DocuSi gn for the signing and completion of documents, which is encrypted and only accessible by select School staff and select parents. Student Learning Limitations on School -Provided Devices Equipment o Students will be able to only use the school equipment for school purposes and shall not be used for any non-academic purpose by the student or other family members. The School uses the following systems to ensure the school equipment is being used for sch ool purposes (for a full list of blocked domains, URLs, and categories, please see the Expectations for student access to internet and safeguarding personally identifiable information (PII) section): Hapara - used to set which websites and apps the students can use each day, and during specific times. o The School will set the times to go through the end of the day to ensure the equipment is not being used for non -academic purposes. Utilizing Hapara allows the School to monitor the use of the devices. GoGuardian - used to filter out content the students are not to be accessing, such as malicious sites. This software is also used to locate a device if it is reported missing. SonicWall - used to filter out content and websites the students and staff are not allowed to access, which includes but is not limited to: gaming sites, social media, and shopping. 105 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov If the student or family loses a piece of LEA R equipment, the parent/guardian is financially responsible to replace the equipment. They must contact th e School to inform the staff members that the equipment is missing or damaged. Software o Within the student technology policy, LEA R has clearly outlined the sites that are prohibited/limited to students. LEA R uses Hapara, a software that limits the abil ity of students to access sites that are not registered/approved by the school and has contracted with DNS, a technology provider, to ensure that all Chromebooks that students have access to only access appropriate/educational sites. A sample of prohibited sites have been listed in the above section. o Sites that are approved daily include, but are not limited to i-Ready , Achievement Network , Learning Ally , GetEpic , and a ll sites connected to LEA R 's textbooks/curriculum . o School software must be accessed by log -in credentials, which will be provided to staff and students prior to the first day of school. No software utilized by the School is accessible without log -in credentials. o All laptops have GoGuardian installed, which allows the Technology T eam to monitor the location of the device, especially in the event of the device being lost, as well as additional content filtering to ensure students are accessing approved sites . o At no time will students or family members be able to download software on to the school equipment. Additionally, since the School utilizes Hapara to limit which websites that can be accessed, students or family members will not be able to access additional software or websites on the school equipment. Training Training on the proper use of school equipment will be provided to students and families the week of August 17th during summer bridge. Staff will be trained during the weeks of August 3rdthrough August 24thduring the annual Professional Development weeks. If students or parents/guardians need support in using the equipment provided by the School, they should contact 106 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Family Engagement NOTE : OSSE did not provide formal comments to public charter LEAs for these questions. Question 16. Describe the LEA's policy for partnering with families and communicating about continuous learning and school operations. How often families can anticipate hearing from the school, and through which methods of communication; How you are soliciting and incorporating student/family input early and repeatedly about continuous learning; How you will communicate about unanticipated facility closures and the health/safety of the school community; How you will share expectations and training for family participation in their student s learning, including trainings for technology; How you will facilitate introductions to new teachers and classmates at the beginning of the school year; How the LEA will ensure that students and families are given routine feedback on their work both formally (e.g., report cards and progress reports) and informally (e.g., graded work and comments) Sample Responses In addition to standard or more general communication, the response from LEA S committed to universal bilingual translation of written communication. Most notably, the LEA plans to provide all families with quarterly curriculum guides to share the topics and concepts to be c overed in each week of instruction, weekly supply lists, and supplies for families in need. LEA T plan for family engagement was notable in its process for staff home visits to be conducted in addition to standard weekly communications whe n it is deemed safe and appropriate under public health guidance. Additionally, the LEA's plan included a strategy for contacting families requiring more intensive engagement and a structured system for leveraging case management staff. Per the application, case managers will ea ch support a cohort of 6 - 15 students for whom they will coordinate and centralize messaging and hold both d aily and weekly check -ins with progress report and feedback mechanisms. LEA Detail LEA Name LEA Response LEA S Consistent and clear communication with students and families is vital for supporting the community of students and families and for maintaining the health and safety of the school community. Communication to students and families will happen across many media: posted signage in the building, access to resources and information on the school website, and on -demand notification through s ocial media channels and individual outreach. General School- wide Communication Website 107 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov LEA S 's website serves as the location for general information about the school as well as specific details on the program offerings, staff, and typical school operations details (menus, calendar, forms and Family Handbook). This information is available to families 24 hours, 7 days a week. Contact information Current and prospective families can find all information on how to contact school administration. Family Resources Families will be able to find the Family Handbook, school enrollment and registration details, the school calendar, and additional materials to support families. The school's website is the source for the most up - to-date, authoritative Fam ily Handbook. The version of the Family Handbook available on the LEA S website supersedes any other version or copy that families or staff members may have in their files. Food Programs In accordance with OSSE guidelines, all required information about LEA S 's food program will be available to families on a monthly basis. Operating Status The school's operating status (open, closed, weather delay, etc.) will be communicated on the main page of the website. Should the school need to close due to COVID -19 or for any other health or safety reason, families will be advised via a banner on the homepage. Social Media LEA S has a social media presence on Facebook. This page is used to build broad awareness of LEA S and engage the broader DC community. Direct to Families LEA S relies regularly on e -mail as a tool for sharing important information. The school sends monthly newsletters, calendar e -mails, and letters about school plans and progress directly to families. All written communications are published in English and Spanish. LEA S is prepared to offer professional translation of these resources into other languages, as needs are identified. LEA S can also provide families with physical copies of these communications, upon request. LEA S uses a text message system called Remind ( www.remind.com ) to alert families to school delay s and closings, as well as remind families about upcoming events or important dates. LEA S also communicates directly with families via Transparent Classroom, an online record -keeping platform. It allows teachers to record lessons, make notes, and track progress for each student. It also allows families to get a 108 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov taste of classroom life through photos and descriptions. Transparent Classroom is available to teachers, assistants, administrative team members, parents, and family members. Families will rece ive direct communication from the school (either from administration or their child's guide) at least twice weekly. Family Engagement in Continuous Learning LEA S has crafted an Instructional Delivery Plan in order to provide equitable access to learning for students as we navigate returning to school during a global pandemic. The intention is to continually engage families in the improvement of our remote and onsi te learning opportunities so that the school is providing each student what they need in order to navigate this new way of learning. We will engage families in this process by providing training, opportunities to provide feedback on an ongoing basis, and r esources on how to support their learner at home and when they are learning in -person at school. Building Community During virtual learning, a concerted effort must be made to help students with new teachers get to know their classroom team. From August 18-20, LEA S will host virtual welcome visits. During welcome visits, students have individual meetings with their teachers, and teachers have the opportunity to learn about the student's interests and personality. During the first two weeks of the school year (August 24 -September 4), students in PK3 will have a second one -on-one meeting with their guide before joining for small group PK lessons. Every Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, LEA S teachers host virtual office hours from 3:30 -4pm. During office hou rs any family (new and returning) can meet with their child's teacher to build the relationship and maintain open lines of communication. The theme for the month of September is \"Our Community Values.\" During the entire month, classroom teams will use m orning classroom meeting time to build community, reiterate the values of LEA S , and establish classroom norms and agreements. This month will also focus on the individuality of each student. A variety of classroom activities will invite students to share about themselves (i.e. the meaning/origin of their name; their family's heritage and culture; their traditions). The goal of this month is to help all students develop a strong sense of self, a positive attitude toward the diversity of their classroom, and a feeling of camaraderie and community within their virtual classroom. Family Education 109 1050 First St. NE , Washington, DC 20002 Phone: (202) 727 -6436 TTY: 711 osse.dc.gov Starting in August and continuing on a weekly basis, LEA S will provide virtual and in -person training to support families in navigating the continuous learning plan of LEA S .

LEA S will provide materials and supplies to families, as needed. Continual Improvement LEA S will collect student/family input early and repeatedly about continuous learning. Within the first month of school, LEA S will circulate a family survey to gauge families' understanding of the distance learning program, as well as their satisfaction with their students' experiences. The survey will be circulated via e- mail, text, and paper copies on grocery distribution days. Families may also complete the survey via phone. Results from the surveys will be reviewed by the faculty during a Monday staff meeting and feedback incorporated accordingly. At the conclusion of learning intervals, and at the time of progress reports and report cards, LEA S will work with families to complete surveys, either online or over the phone, to gather their feedback on the implementation of the continuous learning plan. Feedback for Students and Families Just as LEA S plans to collect feedback from families, LEA S teachers will provide families with routine feedback on their student's work and progress. Families receive a curriculum guide that details the skills and concepts that teachers will introduce to students each week.
