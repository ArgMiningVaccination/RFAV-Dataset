She moved to California after PT school and spent most of her 13 years on the west coast as a staff physical therapist at Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center. Dr. Bisson discovered her interest and love of teaching as an adjunct professor at Mount Saint Mary's University in Los Angeles in 2008 under the mentorship of Dr. Deborah Diaz. She relocated to the Twin Cities in 2014 to join the core faculty here at the University of Minnesota. She has been a board-certified Clinical Specialist in Neurologic Physical Therapy (NCS) since 2008 and earned her transitional DPT from Western University of Health Sciences in 2015. She considers herself a \"generalized specialist\" in the area of neurologic physical therapy, with particular expertise in working with individuals who have experienced a stroke, TBI, SCI, or multiple sclerosis. Recently, she has begun pursuing the implementation of virtual reality technology into clinical practice for people with neurologic conditions. Her research interests include interventions for optimal outcomes in patients with chronic neurologic conditions, motor control and motor learning, and assessment and treatment of impaired selective voluntary motor control after upper motor neuron injury. Dr. Bisson also has a passion for educating healthcare professionals and improving access to healthcare services for people in low-resource settings domestically and internationally.-What do you love most about teaching? I thoroughly enjoy the discovery and inquiry that happens in the classroom, joining my students on their educational journey, learning alongside them. I also highly value the symbiosis that teaching and clinical practice have on each other: being an instructor improves my practice as a physical therapist, and being a clinically practicing physical therapist helps inform my role as an instructor. The educational setting allows greater potential to expand the positive impact I can have as one person, to contribute to future practice standards in the profession of physical therapy, and to explore possibilities for change and development. -Fun fact:In addition to my PT career, I have been an actor and musician most of my life, and my favorite role I've played to date is Annie Sullivan in \"The Miracle Worker.\" Research Summary Research Summary/Interests - Dosing of physical therapy for optimal outcomes in patients with chronic neurologic conditions. - Provision of physical therapy services and education in underserved areas locally, nationally, and internationally. - Methods of assessment of impaired selective voluntary motor control after upper motor neuron injury, its impact on function, and intervention strategies.

The diverse causes of back and neck pain lead to difficulties in differential diagnosis, hindering patient-specific individualized treatment. Dr. Ellingson's multifaceted research strategy aims to overcome these limitations by identifying aberrant spinal motion patterns, quantifying intervertebral disc pathology, and isolating neuromuscular responses to pain. Ultimately, by integrating these approaches he strives to assess and enhance an individual's functional ability in an effort to improve their quality of life.

[ Rachel Hawe Assistant Professor rhawe@umn.edu View full bio ](#gallery-pop-4986) Bio Areas of interest Neurorehabilitation, motor control and development, stroke, robotics, neuroimaging Degrees 2020 Post-doctoral Fellowship, Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB 2016 PhD, Biomedical Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 2013 DPT, Physical Therapy, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 2008 BS, Biomedical Engineering, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY My overall research goal is to maximize recovery following a neurologic injury such as stroke. A key challenge in neurorehabilitation is a poor understanding of the specific impairments an individual may have, which makes it difficult to target therapies. I use robotics to measure specific motor and sensory impairments, and then link these impairments with neuroimaging findings. I am specifically interested in bilateral coordination in both adults who have had a stroke as well as children with hemiparetic cerebral palsy due to a stroke early in development. One of my areas of research will focus on developing robotic assessments of bilateral coordination. Bilateral coordination encompasses a wide range of tasks, from picking up a box with both hands to stabilizing a jar with one hand while opening it with the other. Robotic assessments can allow us to pinpoint the specific areas of bilateral coordination that are impaired in individuals with stroke and cerebral palsy, and then relate these impairments with neuroimaging findings. This will lead to more targeted interventions to improve rehabilitation outcomes. A second area of focus is in how bilateral arm use typically develops, and how it is impacted by an early lesion. Accelerometers can be worn on the wrists to quantify how much a child moves their arms in daily life. We can then develop interventions to promote the use of the weaker arm in children with early lesions. Encouraging early use of the affected arm can drive positive neuroplastic changes to improve outcomes in children with hemiparetic cerebral palsy.

In addition, we aim to develop novel treatment strategies to improve cardiorespiratory regulation and decrease cardiovascular disease. The CRRL uses a multi-system approach to understand blood pressure regulation as the maintenance of blood pressure at rest and during exercise involves a highly redundant and sophisticated integration of multiple systems with the goal of maintaining homeostasis. Our laboratory uses several techniques to quantify autonomic function and limitations to exercise in healthy and clinical populations, such as those with cardiovascular diseases and muscular dystrophy. Techniques in our lab to quantify autonomic function are muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), which is the gold standard for measuring sympathetic activity, electrocardiography, heart rate variability, baroreflex function and venous occlusion plethysmography to measure limb blood flow. Our laboratory is also interested in limitations to exercise, including cardiopulmonary and skeletal muscle factors in healthy and clinical populations. We conduct maximal/peak oxygen consumption (VO2max/peak)tests as well as fatigability tests isolated to single muscle groups. We aim to understand the contributing factors of autonomic dysregulation to cardiovascular disease and identify optimal treatment strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk and mortality in adults. Current projects - Mechanisms of increased cardiovascular disease risk in women who enter menopause premature or early - Influence of menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes and sleep disturbance, to autonomic blood pressure regulation. - Mechanisms of exercise intolerance in clinical populations including muscular dystrophy and heart failure - The contribution of locomotor muscle afferents (group III and IV) to central drive and cardiorespiratory responses during exercise in both healthy adults and those with heart failure - Use of neuromodulation to improve blood pressure in clinical populations.

We are particularly interested in how the loss of estradiol causes muscle weakness and impaired regeneration of injured muscles. Our studies point toward the deterioration of myosin function and satellite cells as two of the culprits. We are highly collaborative in muscular dystrophy research having published with eight other UMN muscle biologists. Our studies often have a flavor of exercise science and preventative medicine as well as rehabilitation. Trainee research experiences are enriched by the collaborative nature of our work that intersects muscle research from fields of biochemistry, physiology, biophysics, engineering, molecular and stem cell biology, pathology, endocrinology, immunology, and bone biology.

The current research plan includes development and testing the effectiveness of biomechanically based rehabilitation strategies for improving shoulder function and reducing pain and disability in persons with pathologies related to abnormal movement patterns. Currently, in-vivo 3D motion and muscle activity data is collected from healthy and symptomatic subjects and integrated with state of the art shoulder models derived from imaging data. Dr. Ludewig's past and ongoing work is identifying mechanics of the full shoulder complex, identifying kinematic mechanisms of shoulder and foot dysfunction, quantifying effects of motion deviations on mechanical impingement risk to the rotator cuff tendons, and assessing the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions including exercise programs.

She is also the Director of the Brain Body Mind Lab. The main research focus of her lab is to investigate the brain mechanisms of body awareness in physical therapy (cognitive multisensory rehabilitation or CMR) as well as mind and body approaches (such as Qigong) to improve health and daily life function in people with chronic neurological conditions and/or chronic pain. Her lab made a crucial discovery that focus on body awareness using CMR led to restoration of the disrupted parietal operculum network in adults with chronic stroke, in parallel with long-lasting improved upper limb sensorimotor function. Her studies of CMR on reducing neuropathic pain and improving sensorimotor function in other neurological conditions such as adults with spinal cord injury have led to long-lasting significant neuropathic pain reduction and improved sensation and movement. Those sensorimotor improvements were paired with significant improvements in brain function. Since mind and body approaches have been shown to improve body awareness and reduce pain, she also investigated the effect of Qigong on body awareness-related brain functions in adults with chronic low back pain and adults with neurological conditions such as adults with spinal cord injury with and without neuropathic pain with significant lasting reduction in chronic pain. Her long-term goals are to investigate the interactions between body awareness, physical impairments, and psychological factors such as mindset (brain-body-mind interactions) to facilitate development and implementation of new rehabilitation strategies that attend to these factors to provide pain relief and increased health and functional recovery in adults with chronic neurological conditions and/or chronic pain.

Previously as Chair of the AACN Student Affairs Committee, he developed numerous student-focused programs for AACN including leading the first comprehensive survey of neuropsychology trainees. As part of his role as a Professor, his passion is to facilitate exceptional doctoral and postdoctoral training in neuropsychology while providing high-quality neuropsychological services to adults from diverse backgrounds with a wide range of neurological and psychiatric conditions. - What do you love most about teaching? My biggest joy in teaching is having the opportunity to mentor and teach clinical neuropsychology to the next generation of professionals. I find the give and take of teaching bright, dedicated students and residents extremely rewarding and enriching to me. I consider myself a lifelong learner, and I try to convey that sentiment in every teaching moment. - What do you love most about Minnesota? There are so many things to love about Minnesota, it's hard to say just one thing. That being said, the people of Minnesota make it such an amazing place to live and work. Minnesotans are truly kind, caring, and dedicated individuals who make it a pleasure to come to work every day. - Fun fact about you: In addition to my work as a neuropsychologist, I am an avid jazz and classical musician and play in several bands around town. I also enjoy hiking, biking, amateur astronomy, and travel, particularly to national parks where my wife and I have a \"bucket list\" goal to see every unit within the National Park Service.
