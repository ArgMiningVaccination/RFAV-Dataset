Outbreaks of pertussis were first described in the 16th century, and the organism was first isolated in 1906. In the 20th century pertussis was one of the most common childhood diseases and a major cause of childhood mortality in the UnitedStates. Prior to the availability of pertussis vaccine in the 1940s,more than 200,000 cases of pertussis were reported annually. Sincewidespread use of the vaccine began, incidence has decreased morethan 98%, to an average of about 4,400 cases per year since 1980. Pertussis remains a major health problem among children in developing countries, with an estimated 285,000 deaths resultingfrom the disease in 2001. BORDETELLA PERTUSSIS B. pertussis is a small aerobic gram-negative rod. It is fastidious, and requires special media for isolation (see section on LaboratoryDiagnosis). B. pertussis produces multiple antigenic and biologically active products, cyclase, pertactin, and tracheal cytotoxin.These products are responsible for the clinical features of pertussis disease, and an immune response to one or more produces immunityto subsequent clinical illness. Recent evidence suggests that immunity from B. pertussis infection may not be permanent. PATHOGENESIS Pertussis is primarily a toxin-mediated disease. The bacteria attach to the respiratory cilia, produce toxins that paralyze the cilia, andcause inflammation of the respiratory tract, which interferes with theclearing of pulmonary secretions. Pertussis antigens appear to allowthe organism to evade host defenses, in that lymphocytosis is promoted, but chemotaxis is impaired. Until recently it was thoughtthat B. pertussis did not invade the tissues. However, recent work has shown the bacteria in alveolar macrophages. CLINICAL FEATURES The incubation period of pertussis is commonly 7-10 days, with a range of 4-21 days, and rarely may be as long as 42 days. The clinical course of the illness is divided into three stages. The first stage, the catarrhal stage, is characterized by the insidious onset of coryza (runny nose), sneezing, low-grade fever, and a mild, occasional cough, similar to the common cold. The cough graduallybecomes more severe, and after 1-2 weeks, the second, or paroxysmal stage, begins. 757 It is during the paroxysmal stage that the diagnosis of pertussis is usually suspected. Characteristically, the patient has bursts, orparoxysms of numerous, rapid coughs, apparently due to difficultyexpelling thick mucus from the tracheobronchial tree. At the end ofthe paroxysm, a long inspiratory effort is usually accompanied by acharacteristic high-pitched whoop. During such an attack, thepatient may become cyanotic (turn blue). Children and younginfants, especially, appear very ill and distressed. Vomiting andexhaustion commonly follow the episode. The patient usuallyappears normal between attacks. Paroxysmal attacks occur more frequently at night, with an average of 15 attacks per 24 hours. During the first 1 or 2 weeks of thisstage the attacks increase in frequency, remain at the same level for2 to 3 weeks, and then gradually decrease. The paroxysmal stageusually lasts 1 to 6 weeks, but may persist for up to 10 weeks.Infants younger than 6 months of age may not have the strength tohave a whoop, but they do have paroxysms of coughing. In the convalescent stage, recovery is gradual. The cough becomes less paroxysmal and disappears in 2 to 3 weeks. However,paroxysms often recur with subsequent respiratory infections for many months after the onset of pertussis. Fever is generally minimal throughout the course of pertussis. Older persons (i.e., adolescents and adults ), and those partially protected by the vaccine may become infected with B. pertussis ,b u t usually have milder disease. Pertussis in these persons may presentas a persistent (>7 days) cough, and may be indistinguishable from other upper respiratory infections. Inspiratory whoop is uncommon. B. pertussis is estimated to account for up to 7% of cough illnesses per year in older persons. Even though the disease may be milder in older persons, these infected persons may transmit the disease to other susceptible persons, including unimmunized or incompletely immunizedinfants. Adults are often found to be the first case in a householdwith multiple pertussis cases. COMPLICATIONS Y oung infants are at highest risk for acquiring clinical pertussis,and for pertussis-associated complications. Secondary bacterialpneumonia is the most common complication and the cause ofmost pertussis-related deaths. Data from 1997-2000 indicate that pneumonia occurred among 5.2% of all reported pertussiscases, and among 11.8% of infants <6 months of age. Neurologic complications such as seizures and encephalopathy (a diffuse disorder of the brain) may occur as a result of hypoxia(reduction of oxygen supply) from coughing, or possibly from toxin.Neurologic complications of pertussis are more common amonginfants. In 1997-2000, seizures and encephalopathy were reportedamong 0.8% and 0.1%, respectively, of all cases, and among 1.4% and 0.2%, respectively, of infants <6 months of age. 76Pertussis 7Pertussis Other less serious complications of pertussis include otitis media, anorexia, and dehydration. Complications resulting from pressureeffects of severe paroxysms include prolapse. In 1997-2000, 20% of all reported pertussis cases required hospitalization, including 63% of all infants younger than 6 monthsof age. In this 4 year period, 62 deaths were due to pertussis (case-fatality rate 0.2%). Fifty-six (90%) of these deaths occurredin children younger than 6 months of age. LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS The diagnosis of pertussis is usually based upon a characteristic history and physical examination. However, laboratory tests may be useful in young infants, atypical cases, and cases modified by vaccine. The standard and preferred laboratory test for diagnosis of pertussisis isolation of B. pertussis by culture . A positive culture for B. pertussis confirms the diagnosis. Fastidious growth requirements make B.pertussis difficult to isolate. Isolation of the organism using direct plating is most successful during the catarrhal stage.Specimens from the posterior nasopharynx, not the throat, shouldbe obtained using Dacron \u00aeor calcium alginate (not cotton) swabs and should be plated directly onto selective media. Success in isolating the organism declines with prior antibiotic therapy effectiveagainst pertussis (erythromycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole)or delay in specimen collection beyond the first 2 weeks of illness, orin vaccinated persons. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates can be a rapid, sensitive, and specific method fordiagnosing pertussis. Currently, it is only available in certain labora-tories; the assays vary among laboratories and are not standardized.PCR should be used in addition to culture, not as a replacement forculture, because bacterial isolates may be required for evaluation ofantimicrobial resistance, or for molecular typing. Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing of nasopharyngeal specimens may be useful as a screening test for pertussis. Becausedirect fluorescent antibody testing of nasopharyngeal secretions hasbeen shown in some studies to have low sensitivity and variablespecificity, it should not be relied on as a criterion for laboratoryconfirmation. Serological testing has proven useful in clinical studies, but is not yet standardized. Due to lack of association between antibody levelsand immunity to pertussis, results of serologic testing are difficult tointerpret. For these reasons, serologic testing is not widely available.In some areas it is used for clinical diagnosis and reporting, but inthe absence of standardization, serologic test results should not berelied upon for case confirmation for the purpose of national report-ing. Cases meeting the clinical case definition that are serologically positive, but not culture positive or PCR positive, should be reported as probable cases. 777An elevated white blood cell count with a lymphocytosis is usually present in classical disease. The absolute lymphocyte countoften reaches 20,000 or greater. However, there may be no lymphocytosis in infants and children or in mild or modified cases of pertussis. More information on the laboratory diagnosis of pertussis is available on the National Immunization Program website. MEDICAL MANAGEMENT The medical management of pertussis cases is primarily supportive,although antibiotics are of some value. Erythromycin is the drug of choice. This therapy eradicates the organism from secretions, thereby decreasing communicability and, if initiated early, may modify thecourse of the illness. Erythromycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis should be administered for 14 days to all household and other close contacts of persons with pertussis, regardless of age and vaccination status. Although data from controlled clinical trials are lacking, prophylaxisof all household members and other close contacts may prevent orminimize transmission. All close contacts younger than 7 years ofage who have not completed the four-dose primary series shouldcomplete the series with the minimal intervals (minimum age forfirst dose is 6 weeks; minimum intervals from dose one to two andfrom dose two to three are 4 weeks; minimum interval from dosethree to four is 6 months). Close contacts who are 4-6 years of ageand who have not yet received the second booster dose (usually the fifth dose of DTaP) should be vaccinated. EPIDEMIOLOGY OCCURRENCE Pertussis occurs worldwide. RESERVOIR Pertussis is a human disease. No animal or insect source or vector is known to exist. Adolescents and adults are an important reservoirfor B. pertussis and are often the source of infection for infants. TRANSMISSION Transmission most commonly occurs by the respiratory route through contact with respiratory droplets, or by contact with airborne droplets of respiratory secretions. Transmission occurs lessfrequently by contact with freshly contaminated articles of an infect-ed person. A silent carrier sta te is thought to exist, but is infrequent, transient in duration, and probably of little importance in maintaining pertussis organisms in the community. 78Pertussis 7Pertussis TEMPORAL PATTERN Pertussis has no distinct seasonal pattern, but may increase in the summer and fall. COMMUNICABILITY Pertussis is highly communicable, as evidenced by secondary attackrates of 80% among susceptible household contacts. Persons withpertussis are most infectious during the catarrhal period and thefirst 2 weeks after cough onset ( i.e., approximately 21 days). SECULAR TRENDS IN THE UNITED STATES Prior to the availability of vaccine, pertussis was a common cause of morbidity and mortality among children. During the six years of1940-1945, more than 1 million cases of pertussis were reported, anaverage of 175,000 cases per year (incidence of approximately 150cases per 100,000 population). Following introduction of vaccine in the 1940s, pertussis incidence gradually fell, reaching 15,000 reported cases in 1960 (~8 per100,000 population). By 1970, annual incidence was fewer than 5,000 cases per year, and from 1980-1990, an average of 2,900 casesper year were reported (approximately 1 per 100,000 population). Pertussis incidence has been gradually increasing since the early1980s. A total of 11,647 cases was reported in 2003, the largestnumber since 1964. The reasons for the increase are not clear. In 1997-2000, the highest annual pertussis incidence was among infants aged younger than 1 year (55.5 cases per 100,000 popula-tion). In 2002, 24% of all reported cases were in this age group.Compared with surveillance data for 1994-1996, the pertussis incidence rate among adolescents and adults increased 62% and60%, respectively, in 1997-2000. These increases could reflect achange in reporting or a true increase in incidence. In 1995,criteria for reporting a pertussis case changed in two ways: poly-merase chain reaction (PCR) became a method of confirmation,and data collection began for pertussis cases epidemiologicallylinked to another pertussis case. These changes primarily affectedthe reporting among persons aged 10 years and older. Increasedrecognition and diagnosis of pertussis among older age groupsprobably contributed to the large recent increase of reported casesamong adolescents and adults. Of the 10,650 children 3 months to 4 years of age with reported pertussis during 1990-1996 and known vaccination status, 54%were not age-appropriately vaccinated with DTaP. 797 CASE DEFINITION The current case definition for pertussis was developed and adopted by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) andthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It defines aclinical case of pertussis as an acute cough illness lasting at least 2weeks with either paroxysms of coughing, inspiratory \"whoop,\" orpost-tussive vomiting without other apparent cause (as reported by ahealth professional). CASE CLASSIFICATION Probable \u2014Meets the clinical case definition, but is not laboratory confirmed and is not epidemiologically linked to a laboratory- confirmed case. Confirmed \u2014A clinically compatible case that is laboratory- confirmed or epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-confirmed case. The clinical case definition above is appropriate for endemic or sporadic cases. In outbreak settings, including household exposures,a case can be defined as an acute cough illness lasting at least 2weeks without other symptoms. See the pertussis chapter of theManual for the Surveillance of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (available on NIP website) for more information on case classification. Both probable and confirmed cases should be reported to theNational Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). PERTUSSIS VACCINES WHOLE-CELL PERTUSSIS VACCINE Whole-cell pertussis vaccine is composed of a suspension of formalin-inactivated B. pertussis cells. It was developed in the 1930s, and used widely in clinical practice by the mid-1940s. Based on controlled efficacy trials conducted in the 1940s and on subsequent observational efficacy studies, a primary series of fourdoses of whole-cell DTP vaccine was 70% to 90% effective in preventing serious pertussis disease. Protection from pertussis vaccine decreased with time, resulting in little or no protection 5 to 10 yearsfollowing the last dose. Local reactions such as redness, swelling,and pain at the injection site occurred following up to half of dosesof whole-cell DTP vaccines. Fever, and other mild systemic events were also common. More severe systemic reactions, such as convulsions and hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes occurred less frequently(one case to 1,750 doses administered). Acute encephalopathyoccurred even more rarely (0-10.5 cases per million doses adminis-tered). Experts disagreed on whether whole-cell pertussis vaccinecaused lasting brain damage, but agreed that if the vaccine causedsuch damage it did so only rarely. Concerns about safety led to thedevelopment of more purified (acellular) pertussis vaccines that areassociated with a lower frequency of adverse reactions. 80Pertussis 7Pertussis ACELLULAR PERTUSSIS VACCINE Acellular pertussis vaccines contain purified, inactivated components of B. pertussis cells. Several acellular pertussis vaccines have been developed that contain different components in varying concentrations. Acellular pertussis vaccines were first licensed forthe fourth and fifth doses of the pertussis series in 1991, and for theprimary series in 1996. Three acellular pertussis vaccines are currently available for use in the United States. All three vaccines are combined with diphtheriaand tetanus toxoids as DTaP. Infanrix (GlaxoSmithKline) toxin (PT) and FHA. Tripedia (AventisPasteur) contains two components, FHA and PT, in equal amounts.Daptacel (Aventis Pasteur) contains four components, PT, FHA,pertactin, and fimbriae types 2 and 3. IMMUNOGENICITY AND VACCINE EFFICACY Since 1991, several studies conducted in Europe and Africa haveevaluated the efficacy of DTaP vaccines administered to infants.These studies varied in type and number of vaccines, design, casedefinition, and laboratory method used to confirm the diagnosis ofpertussis, so comparison among studies must be made with caution.Point estimates of vaccine efficacy ranged from 80% to 85% for vaccines currently licensed in the United States. Confidenceintervals for vaccine efficacy overlap, suggesting that none of the vaccines is significantly more effective than the others. When studied, the acellular pertussis vaccine was significantly more effective thanwhole-cell DTP. Mild local and systemic adverse reactions andmore serious adverse reactions (such as high fever, persistent crying,hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes, and seizures) occurred less frequently among infants vaccinated with acellular pertussis vaccinesthan among those vaccinated with whole-cell DTP. VACCINATION SCHEDULE AND USE Acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) is recommended for all doses of the pertussis schedule.Whole-cell vaccine (DTP) is no longer available in the U.S.The primary series of DTaP consists of four doses of vaccine, the first three doses given at 4-to 8-week intervals (minimum of 4 weeks), beginning at 6 weeks to 2 months of age.The fourth dose is given 6-12 months after the third to maintain adequate immunity for the ensuing preschool years. DTaP should beadministered simultaneously with all other indicated vaccines. The fourth dose of all brands of DTaP is licensed, and recommended by ACIP, to be administered at 15-18 months of age (17-20 months for Daptacel). However, ACIP recommends that in certain circumstances the fourth dose be given earlier than 15 months ofage. ACIP recommends that the fourth dose of DTaP be given ifthe child is at least 12 months of age , and at least 6 months have elapsed since the third dose of pertussis vaccine was given, and, in the opinion of the immunization provider, the child is unlikely to return for an 817 additional visit at 15-18 months of age . All three of these criteria should be met in order to administer the fourth dose of DTaP at12-14 months of age. Children who received all four primary doses before the 4th birthday should receive a fifth (booster) dose of DTaP before entering school. This booster dose is not necessary if the fourth dose in theprimary series was given on or after the 4th birthday. The boosterdose increases protective antibody levels and may decrease the riskof school-age children transmitting the disease to younger siblingswho are not fully vaccinated. Tripedia and Infanrix are approved forthe fifth dose following a series of 4 doses of DTaP. For children who have started the vaccination series with whole-cell DTP, DTaP should be substituted for any remaining doses of the pertussis series . A pertussis vaccination series begun with whole-cell DTP should be completed with DTaP. ACIP recommends that the series be completed with the same brand of DTaP vaccine if possible. Limited data suggest that \"mixand match\" DTaP schedules do not adversely affect safety andimmunogenicity. The vaccine provider might not know or haveavailable the type of DTaP vaccine previously administered to achild. In this situation, any available DTaP vaccine should be usedto continue or complete the vaccination series. Providers shouldnot miss the opportunity to administer a dose of acellular pertussisvaccine for which the child is eligible if the vaccine used for the earlier doses is not known or not available. Interruption of the recommended schedule or delayed doses does not lead to a reduction in the level of immunity reached oncompletion of the primary series. There is no need to restart a series regardless of the time that has elapsed between doses. No single antigen pertussis vaccine is available.No pertussis-containing vaccine is currently licensed for persons 7 years of age or older. Vaccine reactions are thought to be more frequent in older age groups, and pertussis-associated morbidity andmortality decrease with increasing age. Vaccination with DTaP isnot recommended after the 7th birthday. Two manufacturers havefiled applications to license vaccines containing acellular pertussisvaccine and adult formulation tetanus and diphtheria toxoids. Oneor both of these products may be available within the next year.ACIP has not yet developed recommendations for how these vaccines should be used. COMBINATION VACCINES CONTAINING DTaP TRIHIBIT One combination DTaP\u2014Hib vaccine is available in the United States (TriHIBit, Aventis Pasteur). The vaccines are provided inseparate vials, and the DTaP component (Tripedia) is used to 82Pertussis 7 Pertussis reconstitute the Hib component (ActHIB). No other brand of DTaP and Hib vaccine may be used to produce this combination(e.g., Infanrix must not be substituted for Tripedia). In addition, when supplied as TriHIBit, the DTaP and Hib components have asingle lot number. Providers should generally use only the DTaPand Hib supplied together as TriHIBit. However, it is acceptable to combine Tripedia and ActHIB that have been supplied separately (i.e., not packaged as TriHIBit). In this situation, the lot numbers of both vaccines should be recorded in the child's chart. Because of evidence of reduced immunogenicity of the Hib component when used as a combination, TriHIBit is not approvedby the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use as the primaryseries at 2, 4, or 6 months of age. It is approved only for the fourthdose of the DTaP and Hib series. If TriHIBit is administered asone or more doses of the primary series at 2, 4, or 6 months of age,the Hib doses should not be counted, and the child should be revaccinated as age-appropriate for Hib. The DTaP doses may becounted as valid and do not need to be repeated. Although TriHIBit cannot be used in the primary series at 2, 4, or 6 months of age, it may be used as the booster (final) dose following a series of single-antigen Hib vaccine or combination hepatitis B\u2014 Hib vaccine (COMVAX). Therefore, TriHIBit can be used if thechild is aged > 12 months, and has received at least one prior dose of Hib vaccine > 2 months earlier, and TriHIBit will be the last dose in the Hib series. For example, TriHIBit can be used for thebooster dose at 12-15 months of age in a child who has receivedCOMVAX or PedvaxHib at 2 and 4 months of age, or 3 priordoses of HibTiter or ActHib. TriHIBit can also be used at 15-59months of age in a child who has received at least one prior dose ofany Hib-containing vaccine. TriHIBit should not be used if thechild has received no prior Hib doses. PEDIARIX In 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvedPediarix (GlaxoSmithKline), the first pentavalent (5 component)combination vaccine licensed in the U.S. Pediarix contains DTaP (Infanrix), hepatitis B (Engerix-B), and inactivated polio vaccines. Inthe prelicensure studies, the proportion of children who developed a protective level of antibody, and the titer of antibody, was at leastas high for the vaccine antigens given together as Pediarix asamong children who received separate vaccines. The minimum age for the first dose of Pediarix is 6 weeks, so it cannot be used for the birth dose of the hepatitis B series. Pediarixis approved for the first three doses of the DTaP and IPV series,which are usually given at about 2, 4, and 6 months of age; it is notapproved for fourth or fifth (booster) doses of the DTaP or IPVseries. However, Pediarix is approved for use through 6 years ofage. A child who is behind schedule can still receive Pediarix aslong as it is given for doses one, two, or three of the series, and thechild is less than 7 years of age. 837 A dose of Pediarix inadvertently administered as the fourth or fifth dose of the DTaP or IPV series does not need to be repeated. Pediarix may be used interchangeably with other pertussis-containing vaccines if necessary (although ACIP prefers the use of the samebrand of DTaP for all doses of the series, if possible). It can begiven at 2, 4, and 6 months to infants who received a birth dose ofhepatitis B vaccine (total of 4 doses of hepatitis B vaccine).Although not labeled for this indication by FDA, Pediarix may beused in infants whose mothers are HBsAg positive or whoseHBsAg status is not known. OTHER DTaP ISSUES Infants and children with recognized, possible, or potential underlying neurologic conditions present a unique problem. These children appear to be at increased risk for manifesting theunderlying neurologic disorder within 2-3 days after vaccination.However, more prolonged manifestations or increased progressionof the disorder, or exacerbation of the disorder have not been recognized. In certain circumstances, vaccination with DTaP vaccine should be delayed until the child has been evaluated, treatment initiated, andthe condition stabilized. These conditions include the presence ofan evolving neurologic disorder ( e.g.,uncontrolled epilepsy, infantile spasms, and progressive encephalopathy), a history of seizures whichhas not been evaluated, or a neurologic event which occurs betweendoses of pertussis vaccine. A family history of seizures or other neurologic diseases, or stable or resolved neurologic conditions ( e.g., controlled idiopathic epilepsy, cerebral palsy, developmental delay) are not contraindications topertussis vaccination. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be adminis-tered to these children at the time of DTaP vaccination, and for 24hours thereafter, to reduce the possibility of postvaccination fever. Reducing the dose of whole-cell DTP or DTaP vaccine , or giving the full dose in multiple smaller doses may result in an altered immune response and inadequate protection. Furthermore, there isno evidence that the chance of a significant vaccine reaction is likelyto be reduced by this practice. The use of multiple reduced dosesthat together equal a full immunizing dose or the use of smallerdivided doses is not endorsed or recommended. Any vaccination using less than the standard dose should not be counted, andthe person should be revaccinated according to age. Children who have recovered from documented pertussis do not need additional doses of pertussis vaccine. Satisfactory docu-mentation includes recovery of B. pertussis on culture or typical symptoms and clinical course when epidemiologically linked to aculture-proven case, as may occur during outbreaks. When such confirmation of diagnosis is lacking, vaccination should be completed, because the presumed pertussis syndrome may have been caused by 84Pertussis 7 Pertussis other Bordetella species, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or certain viruses. Pertussis accounts for a significant proportion of cough illnesses among adults. In addition, older children and adults with pertussisare often a source of infection for unimmunized or underimmunizedchildren. However, no pertussis vaccine available in the UnitedStates is approved for use among persons aged 7 years or older.Studies have shown that acellular pertussis vaccine is safe andimmunogenic among adults. However, it is not clear that adminis-tration of acellular pertussis vaccine to older children and adults willreduce the risk of their becoming infected with B. pertussis , or will reduce the risk of transmitting pertussis to young children. A per-tussis vaccine for adults may be available in the U.S. in the future. ADVERSE REACTIONS FOLLOWING VACCINATION As with all injected vaccines, administration of DTaP may causelocal reactions , such as pain, redness, or swelling. Local reactions have been reported in 20%-40% of children after the first 3 doses.Local reactions appear to be more frequent after the 4th and/or 5thdoses. Mild systemic reactions such as fever, drowsiness, fretfulness, and low-grade fever may occur after either whole-cellDTP vaccination or DTaP vaccination. However, mild reactions following the first four doses are less common among children whoreceive DTaP. For instance, fever of higher than 101\u00b0 F is reportedin 3%-5% of DTaP recipients compared with 16% of whole-cell DTP recipients. These reactions are self-limited and can be managed with symptomatic treatment with acetaminophen or ibuprofen.Moderate or severe systemic events (such as fever 105\u00b0 F or higher, febrile seizures, persistent crying lasting 3 hours or longer,and hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes) have been reported afteradministration of DTaP, but occur less frequently among childrenadministered DTaP than among children administered whole-cellDTP. Rates of these less common reactions vary by symptom andvaccine, but generally occur in less than 1 in 10,000 doses. See thepertussis chapter in V accines textbook (2003) for a comprehensive review of DTaP adverse event data. Information on adverse reactions following a full series of DTaP is also limited. Available data suggest a substantial increase in the frequency and magnitude of local reactions after the fourth and fifthdoses. For example, swelling at the site of injection increased from2% after the first dose of Tripedia to 29% following the fourth dose.Increases in the frequency of fever after the fourth dose have alsobeen reported, although the increased frequencies of other systemicreactions ( e.g., fretfulness, drowsiness, or decreased appetite) have not been observed. Further details on this issue can be found in asupplemental ACIP statement published in 2000 ( MMWR 2000;49(RR-13):1-8). Swelling involving the entire thigh or upper arm has been reported after booster doses of different acellular pertussis vaccines. The limbswelling may be accompanied by erythema, pain and fever. 857 Although the swelling may interfere with walking, most children have no limitation of activity. The pathogenesis and frequency ofsubstantial local reactions and limb swelling is not known, but theseconditions appear to be self-limited and resolve without sequelae. In the absence of a vaccine supply shortage, ACIP recommends that a fifth dose of DTaP be administered before a child enters school.Whether children who experience entire limb swelling after a fourthdose of DTaP are at increased risk for this reaction after the fifth dose is unknown. Because of the importance of this dose in protecting a child during school years, ACIP recommends that a history of extensive swelling after the fourth dose should not be considered a contraindication to receipt of a fifth dose at school entry . Parents should be informed of the increase in reactogenicity that has been reported following the fourth and fifth doses of DTaP. Despite the increased reactogenicity of the fourth and fifth doses, DTaP remains the preferred vaccine for preventing pertussis,diphtheria, and tetanus among children because of the improvedsafety profile when compared with whole-cell pertussis vaccines. CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS TO VACCINATION Contraindications to further vaccination with DTaP are severe allergic reaction to a vaccine component or following prior dose of vaccine, and encephalopathy not due to another identifiable cause within 7 days of vaccination. Moderate or severe acute illness is a precaution to vaccination. Children with mild illness, such as otitis media or upper respiratoryinfection, should be vaccinated. Children for whom vaccination is deferred due to moderate or severe acute illness should be vaccinated when the condition improves. Certain infrequent adverse reactions following pertussis vaccination will generally contraindicate subsequent doses of pertussis vaccine.These adverse reactions are temperature of 105\u00b0F (40.5\u00b0C or higher) within 48 hours not due to another identifiable cause; collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours; persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours or longer, occurring within 48 hours; and convulsions with or without fever occurring within 3 days. There may be circumstances ( e.g., during a community-wide out- break of pertussis) in which the benefit of vaccination outweighs the risk, even if one of the four precautionary adverse reactionsoccurred following a prior dose. In these circumstances, one ormore additional doses of pertussis vaccine may be considered.DTaP should be used in these circumstances. 86Pertussis 7 Pertussis VACCINE STORAGE AND HANDLING DTaP and DTP vaccines should be stored continuously at 35\u00b0-46\u00b0F (2\u00b0-8\u00b0C). The pertussis antigen is most susceptible toextremes of temperature, although normal ambient temperature upto 4 days will not damage it. Exposure to freezing temperature substantially reduces the potency of the pertussis component. PERTUSSIS SURVEILLANCE Pertussis cases are reported to the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention via two systems. States provide informationabout cases of pertussis, including demographic information, through the Na tional Electronic Transmittal System for Surveillance. More detailed information is reported to CDC through the Supplementary Pertussis Surveillance System (SPSS). Althoughmany pertussis cases are not reported, the surveillance system is useful for monitoring epidemiologic trends. For instance, the highestincidence of pertussis occurs in infancy, the age group at greatest risk for severe illness and complications. In recent years, the surveillancesystem has reflected an increase in the incidence of pertussis in allage groups, most notably among adolescents and adults. Guidelines on pertussis surveillance and outbreak control are available on the National Immunization Program website athttp://www.cdc.gov/nip/publications/pertussis/guide.htm.
