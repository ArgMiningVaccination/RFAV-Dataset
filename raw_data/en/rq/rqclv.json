Conventional treatments often just suppress symptoms, so the problems keep coming back. But symptoms are the body's way of letting you know that something isn't right. Homeopathy is a 200 year old system that relieves suffering without the potential toxic side and after affects of pharmaceuticals. As a result, homeopathy addresses the underlying conditions that are causing the symptoms, so healing is lasting. A classical system of healing I practice by the principles of classical homeopathy, which means: - Treating the whole person, not a single symptom. - Individualizing the treatment. - Prescribing one remedy at a time, at a minimum dose. An approach that works! Homeopathy is used by millions of people worldwide. International market research company, Global TGI, found large numbers of people throughout the world who \"trust in homeopathy.\" Trust in this system of natural medicine was found in 64% of people in India, 58% Brazil, 53% Chile, 49% Saudi Arabia, 49% United Arab Emirates, 40% France, 35% South Africa, 28% Russia, 27% Germany, 25% Argentina, 18% of America, and 15% Great Britain. Homeopathy has been healing people in Europe and India for more than a hundred years. Homeopathic medicine is the leading \"alternative\" treatment used by physicians in Europe and growing numbers of the citizenry. Pharmacies in France and Germany routinely provide homeopathic remedies, and the physician to the British royal family is a homeopathic doctor. The prestigious World Health Organization has deemed France to have the best health care in the world. According to a recent survey published in the respected medical journal, [Family Practice](https://academic.oup.com/fampra/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/fampra/cmv028), 95% of French pediatricians, dermatologists, and general practitioners use homeopathic medicines. Further, 43% of all French health and medical professionals prescribed at least one homeopathic medicine in a 12-month period. These statistics were gathered from the government's prescription records, making this data precise and accurate. In the United States, more and more people are now turning to homeopathy. The effectiveness of homeopathy has also been seen in many scientific studies published in respected journals including Pediatrics, Chest, Rheumatology, The Lancet, and others.

The basis of homeopathy is that very small amounts of a substance that would cause symptoms in a healthy person can treat the same symptoms in an ill person. The remedy that matches the symptoms tweaks the body's vital force so it can heal itself.
