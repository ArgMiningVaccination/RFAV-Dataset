Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Preface Imaging Guidelines Guideline Development (Preface-1) Guideline Development (Preface -1.1) The eviCore healthcare (eviCore) evidence- based, proprietary clinical guidelines evaluate a range of advanced imaging and procedures, including NM, US, CT, MRI, PET, Radiation Oncology, Sleep Studies , as well as Cardiac , musculoskeletal and Spine interventions. eviCore reserves the right to change and update the guidelines. The guidelines undergo a formal review annually. eviCore 's guidelines are based upon major national and international association and society guidelines and criteria, peer - reviewed literature, major treatises as well as , input from health plans, and practicing academic and community -based physicians. These Guidelines are not intended to supersede or replace sound medical judgment , but instead, should facilitate the identification of the most appropriate imaging or other designated procedure given the individual 's clinical condition. These guidelines are written to cover medical conditions as experienced by the majority of individual s. However, these guidelines may not be applicable in certain clinical circumstances, and physician judgment can override the guidelines. Clinical decisions, including treatment decisions, are the responsibility of the individual and his/her provider. Clinicians are expected to use independent medical judgment, which takes into account the clinical circumstances to determine individual management decisions. eviCore supports the Choosing Wisely initiative (www.choosingwisely.org) by the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Foundation and many national physician organizations, to reduce the overuse of diagnostic tests that are low value, no value, or whose risks are greater than the benefits.

CMS requires coverage for studies requested as part of a CMS approved clinical trial though the CMS CED program 2. A list of the currently approved studies is available at: http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coverage/Coverage- with-Evidence- Development/Index Investigational and Experimental Studies Certain advanced imaging studies, or other procedures, may be considered investigational and experimental if there is a paucity of supporting evidence; if the evidence has not matured to exhibit improved health parameters or; the advanced imaging study/procedure lacks a collective opinion of support. Clinical and Research Trials Similar to investigational and experimental studies, clinical trial imaging requests will be considered to determine whether they meet Health Plan coverage and eviCore's evidence- based guidelines. Imaging studies which are inconsistent with established clinical standards, or are requested for data collection and not used in direct clinical management are not supported. Legislative Mandate State and federal legislations may need to be considered in the review of advanced imaging requests.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Preface Imaging Guidelines Clinical Information (Preface-3) Clinical Information (Preface-3 .1) Clinical Documentation and Age Considerations eviCore guidelines use an evidence- based approach to determine the most appropriate procedure for each individual , at the most appropriate time in the diagnostic and treatment cycle. eviCore guidelines are framed by: Clinical presentation of the individual , rathe r than the studies requested Adequate clinical information that must be submitted to eviCore in order to establish medical necessity for advanced imaging or other designated procedures includes, but is not limited to the following: Pertinent C linical evalu ation should includ e a recent detailed history, physical examination 20 since the onset or change in symptoms, and/or laboratory and prior imaging studies. Condition -specific guideline sections may describe additional clinical information which is required for a pertinent clinical evaluation The Spine and Musculoskeletal guidelines require x -ray studies from when the current episode of symptoms has started or changed; x -ray imaging does not have to be within the past 60 days. Advanced imaging or other designated procedures should not be ordered prior to clinical evaluation of an individual by the physician treating the individual. This may include referral to a consultant specialist who will make further treatment decisions. Other meaningful technological contact (telehealth visit, telephone or video call, electronic mail or messaging) since the onset or change in symptoms by an established individual can serve as a pertinent clinical evaluation. Some conditions may require a face to face evaluation as discussed in the applicable condition- specific guideline sections . A recent clinical evaluation may be unnecessary if the individual is undergoing a guideline -supported, scheduled follow -up imaging or other designated procedures evaluation. Exceptions due to routine surveillance indications are addressed in the applicable condition- specific guideline sections. eviCore's evidence based approach to determine the most appropriate procedure for each individual requires submission of medical records pertinent to the requested imaging or other designated procedures . Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Preface Imaging Guidelines Many conditions affecting the pediatric population are different diagnoses than those occurring in the adult population. For those diseases which occur in both pediatric and adult populations, minor differences may exist in management due to individual age, comorbidities, and differences in disease natural history between children and adults. Individual s who are 18 years old or younger 19 should be imaged according to the Pediatric Imaging Guidelines if discussed in the condition- specific guideline sections . Any conditions not specifically discussed in the Pediatric Imaging Guidelines should be imaged according to the General Imaging Guidelines. Individual s who are > 18 years old should be imaged according to the General Imaging Guidelines, except where directed otherwise by a specific guideline section. The terms \"male\" and \"female\" used in these guidelines refer to anatomic -specific diseases and disease predispositions associated with individuals' sex assigned at birth rather than their gender identity. It should be noted that gender identity and anatomic -specific diseases as well as disease predispositions are not always linked. As such, these guidelines should be applied to the individual's corresponding known or suspected anatomic -specific disease or disease predisposition. At eviCore, we believe that it is important to understand how all individuals, including those who are gender -diverse, choose to identify themselves. To ensure that gender -diverse individuals are treated with respect and that decisions impacting their healthcare are made correctly and with sensitivity, eviCore recognizes all individuals with the following gender marker options: Male, Female, Transgender male, Transgender female, \"X \", and \"Not specified\". General Imaging Information \"Standard\" or \"conventional\" imaging is most often performed in the initial and subsequent evaluations of malignancy. Standard or conventional imaging includes plain film, CT, MRI, or US. Often, further advanced imaging is needed when initial imaging, such as ultrasound, CT, or MRI does not answer the clinical question. Uncertain, indeterminate, inconclusive, or equivocal may describe these situations. Appropriate use of contrast is a very important component of evidence- based advanced imaging use. The appropriate levels of contrast for an examination (i.e. without contrast, with contrast, without and with contrast) is determined by the evidence- based guidance reflected in the condition- specific guidelin e sections. If, during the performance of a non- contrast imaging study, there is the unexpected need to use contrast in order to evaluate a possible abnormality, then that is appropriate. 1 Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Preface Imaging Guidelines Ultrasound Diagnostic ultrasound uses high frequency sound waves to evaluate soft tissue structures and vascular structures utilizing greyscale and Doppler techniques. Ultrasound allows for dynamic real -time imaging at the bedside Ultrasound is limited in areas where there is dense bone or other calcification. Ultrasound also has a relatively limited imaging window so may be of limited value to evaluate very large abnormalities In general, ultrasound is highly operator -dependent, and proper training and experience are required to perform consistent, high quality evaluations. Indications for ultrasound may include, but are not limited to: Obstetric and gynecologic imaging Soft tissue and visceral imaging of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and extremities Brain and spine imaging when not obscured by dense bony structures Vascular imaging when not obscured by dense bony structures Procedural guidance when not obscured by dense bony structures Initial evaluation of ill -defined soft tissue masses or fullness and differentiating adenopathy from mass or cyst. Prior to advanced imaging, ultrasound can be very beneficial in selecting the proper modality, body area, image sequences, and contrast level that will provide the most definitive information for the individual . More specific guidance for ultrasound usage, including exceptions to this general guidance, can be found throughout the condition- specific guidelines. Computed Tomography (CT): The AMA CPT\u00ae manual does not describe nor assign any minimum or maximum number of sequences for any CT study. CT imaging protocols are often influenced by the individual clinical situation of the individual and additional sequences are not uncommon. There are numerous CT protocols that may be performed to evaluate specific clinical questions, and this technology is constantly undergoing development. CT utilizes ionizing radiation to create cross -sectional and volumetric images of the body. Advantages over ultrasound include a much larger field of view, and faster completion time in general. Disadvantages compared to ultrasound include lack of portability and exposure to ionizing radiation. Advantages over MRI include faster imaging, and a more spacious scanner area limiting claustrophobia. Disadvantages compared to MRI include decreased soft tissue definition, especially with non- contrast imaging, and exposure to ionizing radiation. CT can be performed without, with, or without and with intravenous (IV) contrast depending on the clinical indication and body area. In general, non- contrast imaging is appropriate for evaluating structures with significant tissue density differences such as lung parenchyma and bony structures, or when there is a contraindication to contrast. In general, CT with contrast is the most common level of contrast, and can be used when there is need for improved vascular or soft tissue resolution, including better characterization of known or suspected malignancy, as well as infectious and inflammatory conditions. Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Preface Imaging Guidelines CT without and with contrast has a limited role as the risks of doubling the ionizing radiation exposure rarely outweigh the benefits of multiphasic imaging, though there are some exceptions which include but are not limited to: Characterization of a mass Characterization of arterial and venous anatomy CT with contras t may be used to better characterize findings on a very recent (within two weeks) inconclusive non- contrast CT where the guidel ines would support CT without and with contras t. More specific guidance for CT contrast usage, including exceptions to this gener al guidance can be found throughout the condition- specific guidelines. Shellfish allergy: It is commonly assumed that an allergy to shellfish in dicates iodine allergy, and that this implies an allergy to iodinated contrast media used with CT. However, this is NOT true. Shellfish allergy is due to tropomyosins. Iodine plays no role in these allergic reactions. Allergies to shellfish do not increase the risk of reaction to iodinated contrast media any more than that of other allergens. 1 Enteric contrast (ora l or rectal) is sometimes used in abdominal imaging. There is no specific CPT\u00ae code which refers to enteric contrast. The appropriate contrast level and anatomic region in CT imaging is specific to the clinical indication, as listed in the condition- spec ific guideline sections. CT should not be used to replace MRI in an attempt to avoid sedation unless it is listed as a recommended study the appropriate condition -specific guideline. There are significant potential adverse effects associated with the use of iodinated contrast media. These include hypersensitivity reactions, thyroid dysfunction, and contrast -induced nephropathy (CIN). Individual s with impaired renal function are at increased risk for CIN. 2 Both contrast CT and MRI may be considered to have the same risk profile with renal failure (GFR <30 mL/min). The use of CT contrast should proceed with caution in pregnant and breastfeeding individual s. There is a theoretical risk of contrast toxicity to the fetal and infant thyroid. The procedure can be performed if the specific need for that contrast -enhanced procedure outweighs risk to the fetus. Breastfeeding individual s may reduce this risk by choosing to pump and discard breast milk for 12- 24 hours after the contrast injection. CT without contrast may be appropriate if clinical criteria for CT with contrast are met AND the individual has: Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and/or creatinine Renal insufficiency Allergies to iodinated contrast Thyroid disease which could be treated with I -131 Diabetes Very elderly Urgent or emergent settings due to availability Trauma Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Preface Imaging Guidelines CT is superior to other imaging modalities in certain conditions, including but not limited to the following: Screening following tra uma Imaging pulmonary disease Imaging abdominal and pelvic viscera Imaging of complex fractures Evaluation of inconclusive findings on Ultrasound or MRI, or if there is a contraindication to MRI More specific guidance for CT usage, including exceptions to this general guidance can be found throughout the condition specific guidelines. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): The AMA CPT\u00ae manual does not describe nor assign any minimum or maximum number of sequences for any MRI study. MRI protocols are often influenced by the individual clinical situation of the individual and additional sequences are not uncommon. There are numerous MRI sequences that may be performed to evaluate specific clinical questions, and this technology is constantly undergoing development. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) utilizes the interaction between the intrinsic radiofrquency of certain M olcules in the body (hydrogen in most cases) and a strong external magnetic field. MRI is often superior for advanced imaging of soft tissues, and can also define physiological processes in some instances [e.g. edema, loss of circulation (AVN), and increased vascularity (tumors)]. MRI does not use ionizing radiation, and even noncontrast images have much higher soft tissue definition than CT or Ultras ound MRI typically takes much longer than either CT or Ultrasound, and for some individual s may require sedation. It is also much more sensitive to individual motion that can degrade image quality thaneither CT or Ultrasound. MRI Breast and MRI Chest are not interchangeable, as they focus detailed sequences on different adjacent body parts. MRI may be utilized either as the primary advanced imaging modality, or when further definition is needed based on CT or ultrasound imaging. Most orthopedic and dental implants are not magnetic. These include hip and knee replacements; plates, screws, and rods used to treat fractures; and cavity fillings. Yet, all of these metal implants can distort the MRI image if near the part of the body being scanned. Other implants, however, may have contraindications to MRI. These include: Pacemakers ICD or heart valves Metal implants in the brain Metal implants in the eyes or ears Infusion catheters and bullets or shrapnel. CT can therefore be an alternative study to MRI in these scenarios. The contrast level and anatomic region in MRI imaging is specific to the clinical indication, as listed in the specific guideline sections. Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Preface Imaging Guidelines MRI is commonly performed without, without and with contrast. Non-contrast imaging offers excellent tissue definition Imaging without and with contrast is commonly used when needed to better characterize tissue perfusion and vascularization. Most contrast is gadolinium based and causes T2 brightening of the vascular and extracellular spaces. Some specialized gadolinium and non- gadolinium contrast agents are available, and most commonly used for characterizing liver lesions. MRI with contrast only is rarely appropriate, and is usually used to better characterize findings on a recent inconclusive non- contrast MRI, commonly called a completion study. MRI contrast is contraindicated in pregnant individuals More specific guidance for MRI contrast usage, including exceptions to this general guidance can be found throughout the condition specific guidelines. MRI may be preferred in individual s with renal failure, and in individual s allergic to intravenous CT contrast. Both contrast CT and MRI may be considered to have the same risk profile with renal failure (GFR <30 mL/min) . 2 Gadolinium can cause (NSF). The greater the exposure to gadolinium in individuals with a low GFR (especially if on dialysis), the greater the chance of individuals developing NSF. Multiple studies have demonstrated potential for gadolinium deposition following the use of gadolinium -based contrast agents (GBCAs) for MRI studies. 3,4,5,6,7 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has noted that there is currently no evidence to suggest that gadolinium retention in the brain is harmful and restricting gadolinium -based contrast agents (GBCAs) use is not warranted at this time. It has been recommended that GBCA use should be limited to circumstances in which additional information provided by the contrast agent is necessary and the necessity of repetitive MRIs with GBCAs should be assessed. 8 A CT may be approved in place of an MRI when clinical criteria are met for MRI AND there is a contraindication to having an MRI (pacemaker, ICD, insulin pump, neurostimulator, etc.) When replacing MRI with CT, contrast level matching should occurs as follows: MRI without contrast CT without contrast MRI without and with contrast CT with contrast or CT without and with contrast The following situations may impact the appropriateness for MRI and or MR contrast Caution should be taken in the use of gadolinium in individual s with renal failure The use of gadolinium contrast agents is contraindicated during pregnancy unless the specific need for that procedure outweighs risk to the fetus. MRI c an be performed for non- ferromagnetic body metals (i.e. titanium), although some imaging facilities will consider it contraindicated if recent surgery, regardless of the metal type MRI should not be used as a replacement for CT for the sole reason of avoidance of ionizing radiation when MRI is not supported in the condition based guidelines, since it does not solve the problem of overutilization. Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Preface Imaging Guidelines MRI is superior to other imaging modalities in certain conditions, including but not limited to the following: Imaging the brain and spinal cord Characterizing visceral and musculoskeletal soft tissue masses Evaluating musculoskeletal soft tissues including ligaments and tendons Evaluating inconclusive findings on ultrasound or CT Individual s who are pregnant or have high radiation sensitivity Suspicion, diagnosis of or surveillance of infections More specific guidance for MRI usage, including exceptions to this general guidance can be found throughout the condition- specific guidelines. Positron Emission Tomography (PET): PET is a nuclear medicine study that uses a positron emitting radiotracer to create cross- sectional and volumetric images based on tissue metabolism. Conventional imaging (frequently CT, sometimes MRI or bone scan) of the affected area(s) drives much of initial and restaging and surveillance imaging for malignancy and other chronic conditions. PET is not indicated for surveillance imaging unless specifically stated in the condition -specific guideline sections. PET/MRI is generally not supported, S ee Preface- 5.3: PET-MRI PET is rarely performed as a single modality, but is typically performed as a combined PET/C T. The unbundling of PET/CT into separate PET and diagnostic CT CPT \u00ae codes is not supported, because PET/CT is done as a single study. PET/CT lacks the tissue definition of CT or MRI, but is fairly specific for metabolic activity based on most PET radiotracer and images glucose metabolism Some specialized radiotracers including Gallium supported in evaluation for some oncologic conditions, while the use of other radiotracers including but not limited to F- 18 Sodium Fluoride is not supported. Indications for PET/CT may include Oncologic Imaging for evaluation of tumor metabolic activity Cardiac Imaging for evaluation of myocardial metabolic activity Brain Imaging for evaluation of metabolic activity for procedural planning More specific guidance for PET usage, including exceptions to this general gu idance can be found throughout the condition- specific guidelines. Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Preface Imaging Guidelines Overutilization of Advanced Imaging: A number of recent reports describe overutilization in many areas of advanced imaging and other procedures, which may include: High level testing without consideration of less invasive, lower cost options which may adequately address the clinical question at hand Excessive radiation and costs with unnecessary testing Defensive medical practice CT without and with contrast (so called \"double contrast studies) requests, which have few current indications. MRI requested in place of CT to avoid radiation without considering the primary indication for imaging Adult CT settings and protocols used for smaller people and children Unnecessary imaging procedures when the same or similar studies have already been conducted. A review of the imaging or other relevant procedural histories of all individual s presenting for studies has been recognized as one of the more important processes that can be significantly improved. By recognizing that a duplicate or questionably indicated examination has been ordered for individual s, it may be possible to avoid exposing them to unnecessary risks. 9, 10 To avoid these unnecessary risks, the precautions below should be considered. The results of initial diagnostic tests or radiologic studies to narrow the differential diagnosis should be obtained prior to performing further tests or radiologic studies. The clinical history should include a potential indication such as a known or suspected abnormality involving the body part for which the imaging study is being requested. These potential indications are addressed in greater detail within the applicable guidelines. The results of the requested imaging procedures should be expected to have an impact on individual management or treatment decisions. Repeat imaging studies are not generally necessary unless there is evidence of disease progression, recurrence of disease, and/or the repeat imaging will affect an individ ual's clinical management. Preoperative imaging/pre- surgical planning imaging/pre -procedure imaging is considered not medically necessary if the surgery/procedure is not considered medically necessary. Once the procedure has been approved or if the procedure does not require prior authorization, the appropriate preprocedual imaging may be approved Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Concurrent supervision is defined as active physician participation in and monitoring of the reconstruction process including design of the anatomic region that is to be reconstructed; determination of the tissue types and actual structures to be displayed (e.g. , bone, organs, and vessels); determination of the images or cine loops that are to be archived; and monitoring and adjustment of the 3D work product. The American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends that it is best to document the physician's supervision or participation in the 3D reconstruction of images. These two codes differ in the need for and use of an independent workstation for post-processing. CPT \u00ae 76376 reports procedures not requiring image post -processing on an independent workstation. CPT\u00ae 76377 reports procedures that require image post -proces sing on an independent workstation. These 3D rendering codes should not be used for 2D reformatting. Two-dimensional reconstruction (e.g. reformatting an axial scan into the coronal plane) is now included in all cross -sectional imaging base codes and is not separately reimbursable. The codes used to report 3D rendering for ultrasound and echocardiography are also used to report the 3D post processing work on CT, MRI, and other tomographic modalities. Providers may be required to obtain prior authorization on these 3D codes even if prior authorization is not required for the echocardiography and/or ultrasound procedure codes. It may appear that eviCore pre-authorizes echocardiography and/or ultrasound when, in fact , it may only be the 3D code that needs the prior authorization.

Additional lesions should be billed using CPT \u00ae 19086. CPT\u00ae 77021 (MR guidance for needle placement ) is not an appropriate code for a breast biopsy . CPT\u00ae 75989 : This c ode is used to report imaging guidance for a percutaneous drainage procedure in which a catheter is left in place. This code can be used to report whether the drainage catheter is placed under fluoroscopy, ultrasound, CT, or MR guidance modality. CPT\u00ae 77011 : A stereotactic CT localization scan is frequently obtained prior to sinus surgery. The dataset is then loaded into the navigational workstation in the operating room for use during the surgical procedure. The information provides exact positioning of surgical instruments with regard to the individual 's 3D CT images. In most cases, the preoperative CT is a t echnical -only service that does not require interpretation by a radiologist. The imaging facility should report CPT \u00ae 77011 when performing a scan not requiring interpretation by a radiologist. If a diagnostic scan is performed and interpreted by a radiologist, the appropriate diagnostic CT code ( e.g., CPT \u00ae 70486) should be used.

The procedure inherently a 3D dataset. CPT\u00ae 77012 (CT) and CPT\u00ae 77021 (MR) : These codes are used to report imaging guidance for needle placement during biopsy, aspiration, and other percutaneous procedures. They represent the radiological supervision and interpretation of the procedure and are often billed in conjunction with surgical procedure codes. For example, CPT\u00ae 77012 is reported when CT guidance is used to place the needle for a conventional arthrogram. Only codes representing percutaneous surgical procedures should be billed with CPT\u00ae 77012 and CPT\u00ae 77021. It is inappropriate to use with surgical codes for open, excisional, or incisional procedures. CPT\u00ae 77021 ( MR guidance for needle placement ) is not an appropriate code for breast biopsy . CPT\u00ae 19085 would be appropriate for the first breast biopsy site, and CPT\u00ae 19086 would be appropriate for additional concurrent biopsies CPT\u00ae 77013 (CT) and CPT\u00ae 77022 (MR) : These codes include the initial guidance to direct a needle electrode to the tumor(s), monitoring for needle electrode repositioning within the lesion, and as necessary for multiple ablations to coagulate the lesion and confirmation of satisfactory coagulative necrosis of the lesion(s) and comparison to pre- ablation images. NOTE: CPT \u00ae 77013 should ablation procedures. CPT\u00ae 20982 includes CT guidance for bone tumor ablations. Only codes representing percutaneous surgical procedures should be billed with CPT\u00ae 77013 and CPT\u00ae 77022. It is inappropriate to use with surgical codes for open, excisional, or incisional procedures. CPT\u00ae 77012 and guidance by different modalities. Only one unit of any of these code s should be reported per individual encounter (date of service).

There is no specific number of sequences or slices defined in any CT CPT\u00ae code definition. The AMA, in CPT\u00ae 2019, does not describe nor assign any minimum or maximum number of sequences or slices for any CT study. A few additional slices or sequences are not uncommon. CT imaging protocols are often influenced by the individual clinical situation of the individual . Sometimes the protocols require more time and sometimes less. SPECT/CT Imaging (Preface- 4.6) SPECT/CT involves SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) nuclear medicine imaging and CT for optimizing location, accuracy, and attenuation correction and combines functional and anatomic information. Common studies using this modality include Metaiodobenzylguanidine scan can be CPT \u00ae 78830 - single area and single day, CPT\u00ae 78831 - 2 or more days, or CPT\u00ae 78832 - 2 areas with one day and 2 day study.

Quantitative mp- MRI uses software to analyze tissue physiology of visceral organs and other anatomic structures non- invasively. At present, these procedures are primarily being used in clinical trials and there is no widely recommended indications in clinical practice. As such, these procedures are considered to be investigational and experimental for coverage purposes. CPT\u00ae 0648T (without diagnostic MRI) and CPT\u00ae 0649T (with diagnostic MRI) refer to data analysis with and without associate imaging of a single organ, with its most common use being LiverMultiScan (LMS) See Fatty Liver (AB-29.2) in the Abdomen Imaging Guidelines CPT\u00ae 0697T (without diagnostic MRI) and CPT\u00ae 0698T (with diagnostic MRI) refer to data analysis with and without associate imaging of a multiple organs, with its most common use being CoverScan HCPCS Codes (Preface -4.9) Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes are utilized by some hospitals in favor of the typical Level 3 CPT \u00ae Codes. These code are typically 4 digits proceeded by a C, or S6 Many of these codes have similar code descriptions to level 3 CPT\u00ae codes (i.e. C8931 - MRA with dye, Spinal Canal, and 72159- MRA Spinal canal) If cases are submitted with HCPCS codes with similar code descriptions to the typical level 3 CPT \u00ae codes, those procedures should be managed in the same manner as the typical CPT\u00ae codes Medicare Does not support approval of \"S\" HCPCS codes HCPCS code management if discussed further in the applicable guideline sections.

The performance of whole body screening CT examinations in healthy individual s does not meet any of the current validity criteria for screening studies and there is no clear documentation of benefit versus radiation risk. Whole body low dose CT is supported for oncologic staging in Multiple Myeloma (See Multiple Myeloma and Plasmacytomas ( ONC- 25) in the Oncology Imaging Guidelines ) Whole Body MR Imaging ( Preface- 5.2) Whole body MRI (WBMRI) is, with the exception of select cancer predisposition syndromes and autoimmune conditions discussed below, generally not supported at this time due to lack of standardization in imaging technique and lack of evidence that WBMRI improves individual outcome for any individual disease state. While WBMRI has the benefit of whole body imaging and lack of radiation exposure, substantial variation still exists in the number of images, type of sequences (STIR vs. diffusion weighting, for example), and contrast agent(s) used. Coding considerations: There are no established CPT \u00ae or HCPCS codes for reporting WBMRI. WBMRI is at present only reportable using CPT\u00ae 76498. All other methods of reporting whole body MRI are inappropriate, including: Separate diagnostic MRI codes for multiple individual body parts MRI Bone Marrow Supply (CPT\u00ae 77084) Disease -specific considerations: Cancer screening: Interval WBMRI is recommended for cancer screening in individual s with select cancer predisposition syndromes . Otherwise, WBMRI has not been shown to improve outcomes for cancer screening. See Li-Fraumeni Syndrome Syndrome) ( PEDONC- 2.15) in the Pediatric Oncology Imaging Guidelines for additional information Cancer staging and restaging While the feasibility of WBMRI has been established, data remain conflicting on whether WBMRI is of equivalent diagnostic accuracy compared with standard imaging modalities such as CT, scintigraphy, and PET imaging. Evidence has not been published establishing WBMRI as a standard evaluation for any type of cancer.

The clinical evaluation may include a relevant history and physical examination, appropriate laboratory studies, and non-advanced imaging modalities such as plain x-ray or ultrasound. Other meaningful contact (telephone call, electronic mail or messaging) by an established individual can substitute for a face-to-face clinical evaluation. Red Flag Findings The following signs and symptoms can be indicative of more serious conditions. Documentation of abdominal pain along with ANY of the following warrants exclusion from prerequisites to advanced imaging: oHistory of malignancy with a likelihood or propensity to metastasize to abdomen oFever (101 degrees Fahrenheit) oElevated WBC >10,000, or above the upper limit of normal for the particular lab reporting the result oPalpable mass of clinical concern and/or without benign features oGI bleeding, overt or occult, not obviously hemorrhoidal oAbdominal tenderness documented as moderate or severe oPeritoneal signs, such as guarding or rebound tenderness oSuspected complication of bariatric surgery oNotation by the ordering provider that the individual has a \"surgical abdomen\" oAge 60 years with unintentional weight loss of 10 lbs. or 5% of body weight over 6 months or less See the condition-specific sections for when the above list of exclusionary criteria apply and lead directly to advanced imaging. Experimental, Investigational, and/or Unproven Techniques Certain imaging studies described in these guidelines are considered investigational and/or unproven (EIU) Reasons for this may include: oThere is a paucity of supporting evidence: The requested procedure has not been shown to be medically effective by sufficient scientific evidence such as well-conducted randomized clinical trials or cohort studies with a sample size of sufficient statistical power, and/or Does not have endorsement by national professional specialty medical societies for the clinical condition being treated, and/or Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCAbdomen Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 No national evidence-based guideline currently advocates the use of the procedure for the indication as requested. oEvidence has not matured to exhibit improved health parameters: Available scientific evidence does not demonstrate use of the requested procedure that leads to superior/improved/better health outcomes for the clinical condition being treated compared to standard, currently available modalities. oThe requested procedure does not have final approval from appropriate governmental regulatory bodies for use in the treatment of the existing clinical condition.

Abdominal imaging begins at the diaphragm and extends to the umbilicus or iliac crest. Pelvic imaging begins at the iliac crest and extends to the pubis. Clinical concerns at the dividing line can be providers' choice (abdomen and pelvis; abdomen or pelvis). Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCAbdomen Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 CT Imaging (AB-1.2) is a more generalized modality. Abdomen is usually performed with contrast (CPT\u00ae 74160): oOral contrast has no relation to the IV contrast administered. Coding for contrast only refers to IV contrast. There is no coding for oral contrast. oExceptions are noted in these guidelines, and include: CT Abdomen with contrast (CPT\u00ae 74160) or without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 74170) with suspicion of a solid organ lesion (liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen). Please refer to the specific guideline for the lesion in question for specific guidance. CT Abdomen without contrast (CPT\u00ae 74150) or CT Abdomen and Pelvis without contrast (CPT\u00ae 74176) if there is renal insufficiency/failure, or a documented allergy to contrast. It can also be considered for diabetics or the very elderly. CT Abdomen and Pelvis without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 74178 certain urologic conditions (e.g. hematuria) oShellfish allergy: It is commonly assumed that an allergy to shellfish infers iodine allergy, and that this implies an allergy to CT iodinated contrast media. However, this is NOT true. Shellfish allergy is due to tropomysins. Iodine plays no role in these allergic reactions. Allergies to shellfish do not increase the risk of reaction to IV contrast any more than that of other allergens. oCT Abdomen and Pelvis, usually with contrast (CPT\u00ae 74177), should be considered when signs or symptoms are generalized, or involve a lower quadrant of the abdomen. oCT Enterography (CPT\u00ae 74177) combines CT imaging with large volumes of ingested neutral bowel contrast material to allow visualization of the small bowel. oCT Enteroclysis A tube is placed through the nose or mouth and advanced into the duodenum or jejunum. Bowel contrast material is infused through the tube and CT imaging is performed either with or without intravenous contrast. CT Enteroclysis is used to allow visualization of the small bowel wall and lumen. CT Enteroclysis may allow better or more consistent distention of the small bowel than CT Enterography.

Their recommendations are as follows:15 Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are not associated with risk and are the imaging techniques of choice for the pregnant patient, but they should be used prudently and only when use is expected to answer a relevant clinical question or otherwise provide medical benefit to the patient. With few exceptions, radiation exposure through radiography, computed tomography (CT) scan, or nuclear medicine imaging techniques is at a dose much lower than the exposure associated with fetal harm. oIf these techniques are necessary in addition to ultrasound or MRI or are more readily available for the diagnosis in question, they should not be withheld from a pregnant patient. The use of gadolinium contrast with MRI should be limited; it may be used as a contrast agent in a pregnant patient only if it significantly improves diagnostic performance and is expected to improve fetal or maternal outcome. With regards to iodinated IV contrast media, \"it is generally recommended that contrast only be used if absolutely required to obtain additional diagnostic information that will affect the care of the fetus or woman during pregnancy\".

PET imaging is not indicated for the evaluation of Sclerosing Mesenteritis or Mesenteric Panniculitis Background and and mesenteric panniculitis are rare, incompletely understood entities that are characterized by an idiopathic inflammatory condition of the mesentery, with radiologic findings including: oFatty mass lesion in the small intestinal mesentery o\"Halo\" (fat ring) surrounding lymph nodes or vessels oLymph in the fatty mass from fat diseases (retractile mesenteritis, mesenteric panniculitis, and mesenteric lipodystrophy), or may be stages of one disease with progression. The chronic inflammation may result in fibrosis with a mass effect and can involve the gut (causing obstruction), the mesenteric vessels, and other intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal organs. The etiology is uncertain, but may be secondary to trauma (previous abdominal surgery), an autoimmune process, ischemia, infection, and possibly may represent a paraneoplastic syndrome secondary to a malignancy, though this is controversial. There is an increased prevalence of malignancy in individuals with sclerosing mesenteritis, and this has resulted in requests for sequential imaging in stable or asymptomatic individuals. In addition, requests may be made to assess the clinical response in those undergoing active treatment. However, studies have reported that the data on potentially developing a subsequent malignancy is inconclusive and thus \"it does not seem justified to subject patients with MP, especially those in whom other associations such as abdomino-pelvic surgery may explain the MP findings, to multiple follow-up CT Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

This recommendation is supported by other authors.2,3,4,5 In addition, there is no correlation between radiolologic and clinical findings, and management decisions are guided by the severity and type of symptoms.

The optimal site for gastrostomy placement is determined by illuminating the abdominal wall from the stomach using the scope and simultaneously indenting the wall with the finger, and visualizing that indention endoscopically. oRoutine CT prior to this is generally not needed. oA recent study5 retrospectively compared complication rates between patients who underwent a pre-procedure CT vs. those that did not, and found no difference in the rate of bleeding events, need for operative intervention, and accidental tube dislodgement. One patient in the non-CT group had an injury due to the tube being placed through the colon, but in that case there was failure of transillumination through the abdominal wall.

MRI can distinguish between primary and secondary iron overload based on iron uptake in the reticuloendothelial system.) For the evaluation of suspected hepatic iron overload in chronic transfusional states (e.g., sickle cell disease, thalassemia, oncology patients, bone marrow failure, and stem cell transplant individuals): oMRI Abdomen without contrast (CPT\u00ae 74181) for iron quantification can be performed annually See: in the Pediatric Abdomen Imaging Guidelines regarding transfusion- associated hepatic iron deposition.

Role of (CPT\u00ae 76391): Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCAbdomen Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 oThe role of MR Elastography to assess the degree of fibrosis in the setting of hemochromatosis is not yet clearly defined and thus not currently approvable. oOne of the main limitations of MR Elastography is that artifact from excess iron deposition degrades signal intensity in MRE sequences, leading to technical failure of elastography and a decrease in MRE's diagnostic reliability. The latest ACG Clinical Guideline (2019) indicates that MRI for the purpose of estimating hepatic iron concentration is appropriate in the circumstances described above. However, \"if there is a concomitant need to stage hepatic fibrosis, then liver biopsy is the preferred method.\"14. The ACG diagnostic algorithm for the workup of hemochromatosis does not include MR Elastography at any stage, including the evaluation for the presence, absence, or degree of fibrosis. Background and Supporting Information An elevated serum ferritin >1000 mcg/l is associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis and mortality in C282 homozygotes, while a serum ferritin <1000 mcg/l is associated with a very low likelihood of cirrhosis. The role of serial MRI for monitoring hepatic iron concentration in hemochromatosis has not been defined. Treatment is phlebotomy and results are monitored by serum ferritin.

Most benign adenomas, which account for up to 75% of adrenal incidentalomas, are lipid rich and thus easily characterized because they measure 10HFU or less on CT without contrast. CT abdomen WWO with calculated washout and chemical shift MRI help identify lipid poor adenomas which are the next most common group. Masses which remain indeterminate include pheochromocytomas (up to 7%) and primary adrenal cancers or metastases to the adrenal glands (approximately 4%). Adrenal masses are often found incidentally on CT scans performed WITH contrast to evaluate abdominal symptoms. While CT scans performed with contrast only may report the HFU of an adrenal mass, most benign adenomas are labeled \"indeterminate\" originally because non-contrasted HFU and HFU after washout cannot be measured or calculated. An \"Adrenal Protocol CT\" measures pre-contrast HFU of an adrenal mass as well as the HFU during \"wash out\" of contrast medium after 60 to 90 seconds [early] and 10 to 15 minutes [delayed]. Benign adenomas show more rapid and efficient contrast washout as compared to malignant adrenal masses. When an adrenal mass shows avid enhancement on CT scan (>110 - 120 HU), a pheochromocytoma should be considered. In addition to the imaging features in the grid which are considered \"diagnostic\" of a benign adrenal mass, other radiographic characteristics \"suggestive\" of a benignity include: shape, homogeneous calcification/hemorrhage/necrosis, of FDG avidity on Radiographic characteristics \"suggestive\" of malignancy include: irregular margins/shape, heterogeneous content, presence of calcification/hemorrhage/necrosis, growth rate >1cm/year, presence of FDG avidity on PET, >4-6cm Malignancies most likely to metastasize to the adrenal glands include lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, melanoma, and renal-cell carcinoma.

Adrenal masses that secrete excess cortisol (adrenal Cushing's syndrome) or aldosterone (primary hyperaldosteronism/Conn's syndrome) are rarely malignant, however surgery is also definitive management Suspected cortisol excess (adrenal Cushing's syndrome) Low or suppressed ACTH levels (<10 pg/mL) are consistent with an adrenal source. DHEAS levels are also low in adrenal Cushing's syndrome. The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome can be delayed for years due to the insidious nature of clinical presentation and the complexity of diagnostic testing. Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCAbdomen Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 Suspected adrenal hyperandrogenism/virilizing adrenal tumor Testosterone is produced by the (primary source) and adrenal gland while DHEA and DHEAS are produced almost exclusively by the adrenal gland. The magnitude of the androgen level is of poor predictive value for tumors, although a very high testosterone (adult-male range) or DHEAS tumors, carcinomas (extremely rare, 0.5-2.0per million), can secrete both estrogens and high amounts of adrenal androgens, which aromatize to estrogens. In this case, gynecomastia is usually of recent onset, progresses rapidly and testicular atrophy can also be seen. Common causes of excessive endogenous estrogens should be excluded prior to adrenal imaging. These include increased secretion from testis (Leydig cell or Sertoli cell tumors, stimulation of normal Leydig cells by LH or hCG) and increased aromatization of androgens to estrogens (aging, obesity, alcoholic cirrhosis, hyperthyroidism, drugs, hCG-secreting tumors, aromatase excess syndrome). Suspected primary aldosteronism (Conn's syndrome) A positive screen for primary aldosteronism is an aldosterone level >15-20ng/dL in the setting of suppressed renin* (plasma renin activity <0.6-1.0ng/mL/hour or plasma renin concentration <5-8.2 and spontaneous hypokalemia (K<3.5mEq/L). The most common dynamic confirmatory tests include the oral sodium suppression test, the seated intravenous saline suppression test, the fludrocortisone suppression test, and the captopril challenge test and results that indicate a \"positive\" result are unique to the each test. For example, if oral sodium loading is used, a 24-hour urine aldosterone excretion of more than 12 mg in the setting of 24-hour urine sodium excretion of more than 200 mEq is diagnostic of primary aldosteronism (and values of more than 10 mg/24 hours are strongly suggestive). Primary hyperaldosteronism may be managed medically with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (spironolactone and eplerenone) in cases of bilateral adrenal disease or poor surgical candidacy. If there has been no recent adrenal imaging, reimaging can be considered in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or poor response to medical therapy. Suspected pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma A pheochromocytoma (85% of chromaffin tumors) arises from the chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla and commonly produces one or more of the following catecholamines: epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine. A paraganglioma (15-20% of chromaffin tumors) arises from the extra-adrenal chromaffin cells of the sympathetic paravertebral ganglia of the thorax, abdomen Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCAbdomen Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 and pelvis (catecholamine producing) or the parasympathetic ganglia along the glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves in the neck and base of skull (not catecholamine producing). Cases of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma can be sporadic but 1/3 are hereditary and due to germ-line mutations that may increase malignant potential. Suspected adrenocortical carcinoma Adrenocortical carcinoma may be suspected radiographically or clinically. Approximately 60% of patients present with evidence of adrenal steroid hormone excess, with or without virilization. Hormonally inactive ACCs typically produce symptoms related to tumor burden, including abdominal pain, back pain, early satiety, and weight loss.

Gastric emptying study with small bowel and colon transit (CPT\u00ae 78266) can be used in the evaluation of suspected abnormalities in both total and regional time for gastrointestinal transit to the colon. Dumping Syndrome Gastric Emptying Study (CPT\u00ae 78264) to evaluate signs or symptoms of dumping syndrome is not indicated Dumping syndrome is a common complication of gastric and bariatric surgery in which changes in anatomy and innervation promote a rapid emptying of gastric contents into the small bowel. This triggers a series of physiologic responses. \"Early dumping\", occurring within the first hour after a meal is characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, gassiness, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea as well as vasomotor symptoms such as flushing, sweatiness, tachycardia, and hypotension). \"Late dumping\" symptoms occurring between 1 and 3 hours after meals are usually related to hypoglycemia (e.g., weakness, confusion, syncope). Dumping syndrome is usually a clinical diagnosis and the recommended diagnostic testing is an oral glucose tolerance test. Evidence-based guidelines have recently concluded that gastric emptying tests have low sensitivity and specificity for dumping syndrome, and that a gastric emptying test showing rapid emptying rate would not be used to confirm a diagnosis of dumping syndrome. Rapid emptying can occur in other conditions, and it has been demonstrated that the initial rapid emptying in dumping may produce symptoms such as nausea, which then delays gastric emptying, such that the Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCAbdomen Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 results of a gastric emptying study are in the normal range. Because of these limitations, recent guidelines have concluded that \"...gastric emptying testing seems to be of low utility in diagnosing dumping syndrome\".18 Note: If both a solid-phase and a liquid-phase gastric emptying imaging study are performed on the same day by any protocol, CPT\u00ae 78264 may not be reported with two units, only 1 unit. However, if a solid-phase study is performed, and then on a later date a liquid-phase study is performed, one unit of CPT\u00ae 78264 may be reported for each date of service. This occurrence should be rare, however, as there are dual-phase imaging protocols that should be employed if both are known to be needed prior to the start of the first study.

The initial assessment should include a history with a delineation of the duration, frequency, and severity of symptoms, including a description of their characteristics and any associated symptoms. The purpose of the initial assessment is to define whether the symptom complex suggests a central (neurologic), endocrine (e.g. pregnancy, thyroid disorder), iatrogenic (chemotherapy/medication-induced), obstructive (e.g., small bowel obstruction), or a mucosal (gastritis, peptic ulcer disease) etiology. Diagnostic testing for nausea and vomiting should be targeted at finding the etiology suggested by a thorough history and physical examination. In the absence of more complicated or serious disease, if the cause is not obvious or suggestive from the history and physical, laboratory data including a CBC, chemistry profile, and, in a reproductive-age female, pregnancy testing, should be performed prior to advanced radiographic imaging. Imaging is based on the findings of the initial evaluation as follows: CT Abdomen and Pelvis with contrast (CPT\u00ae 74177) for ANY of the following: If the initial assessment does not suggest a specific cause If the evaluation proves unproductive Symptoms suggesting mucosal disease (e.g. GERD, suspicion of ulcer disease): EGD prior to advanced imaging If nausea and vomiting remains unexplained despite workup and CT Abdomen and Pelvis is negative: Gastric (CPT\u00ae 78264) Symptoms suggesting an intracranial etiology (vertigo/nystagmus, associated headache, or neurogenic vomiting suggested by a positional nature and/or associated with other neurologic signs and symptoms): Syncope (HD-23) , or other Head Imaging Guidelines depending on the predominant neurologic presentation Nausea and vomiting associated with RUQ pain and suspicion of gallbladder disease, see: Right Upper Quadrant Pain including Suspected Gallbladder Disease (AB-2.3) Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

History of corrective spine surgery for scoliosis Anorexia Nervosa Abdominal surgery Congenital short ligament of Treitz oRadiologic findings or history suggestive of duodenal obstruction oFailure to diagnose either persistent nausea and vomiting despite the workup outlined in Nausea and Vomiting as the Primary Symptom (AB-20.3) Background and Supporting Information SMA syndrome is a rare cause of duodenal obstruction in which there is a decrease in the aortomesenteric angle with resulting compression of the duodenum by the SMA. The typical clinical scenario includes an episode of weight loss followed by chronic food intolerance with nausea and vomiting, further weight loss, and epigastric pain, and can be relieved by lying prone or in the left lateral decubitus position. The diagnosis can be suspected with barium studies demonstrating delayed passage of contrast beyond the duodenum, dilatation of the first and second portions of the duodenum, anti-peristaltic flow of barium proximal to the obstruction, and relief of obstruction when placed in the prone, knee-chest, or left lateral position, or with an upper endoscopy revealing pulsatile extrinsic compression of the duodenum, or plain films suggesting duodenal obstruction.

This is not supported as a routine procedure prior to VCE. It should be noted that a patency capsule is available, and that this may identify patients at higher risk of retention. However, guidance from the consensus group of the American College of Gastroenterology recommends that in individuals with obstructive symptomatology, imaging (MR Enterography or CT Enterography) should be performed prior to VCE. This group would also include high risk individuals with a known history of Crohn's Disease, known history of strictures or other obstruction, history of previous pelvic or abdominal radiation, or suspected tumor.

Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCAbdomen Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 Serologic and genetic markers are currently under investigation with regards to their value in diagnosing inflammatory bowel disease, and are sometimes used as a screening test for IBD in which other examinations are negative. At the current time they are not considered suitable as a screening test for inflammatory bowel disease in patients with GI symptoms, and the routine use of serologic or genetic markers for the diagnosis of IBD is not indicated. Thus, an isolated positive marker result in a patient without any other findings to suggest IBD, especially in the presence of negative inflammatory markers and endoscopic examinations, is not, in and of itself, an indication for advanced imaging. Note: Serologic markers include Supporting Information Studies have demonstrated the negative predictive value of a low fecal calprotectin and CRP with regards to inflammatory bowel disease. Chey, et al. in a meta-analysis demonstrated that a fecal calprotectin <40mcg/g or a CRP 0.5 mg/dl effectively excludes inflammatory bowel disease in patients with IBS. Katsinelos, et al. reviewed wireless capsule endoscopy results in patients with abdominal pain and diarrhea. The diagnostic yield of capsule endoscopy in patients with abdominal pain and diarrhea with positive inflammatory markers was 90.1%, and 0% in patients with abdominal pain and diarrhea with negative inflammatory markers. This led the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology to recommend against the use of capsule endoscopy in persons with chronic abdominal pain or diarrhea as their only symptoms and no evidence of biomarkers associated with Crohn's Disease, stating \"CE (capsule endoscopy) is not warranted in most patients who present with chronic abdominal pain in the absence of positive tests for inflammatory markers or abnormal findings on endoscopy or imaging\".

Background and Supporting Information Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic liver and biliary tract disease that can result in stricturing and fibrosis of the intra- and extra- hepatic biliary ducts, as well as end-stage liver disease. It is most often associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Biliary obstruction can occur anywhere along the biliary tree, resulting in cholangitis, and there is a high risk of the development of cholangiocarcinoma, which must be strongly considered in individuals with PSC and a dominant stricture, as well as an increased risk of gallbladder polyps and other malignancies.

If Li-RADS M (Malignant, not definitely HCC): Repeat or alternative imaging in 3 months, and follow appropriate Oncology guidelines upon diagnosis. Exceptions to the above algorithms: oAdvanced imaging for surveillance may be substituted for US in the following circumstances: Obesity (BMI >35) Marked parenchymal heterogeneity noted on US.

Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) oFurther studies are needed to assess the value of CEUS in this setting, and it should be considered investigational and experimental at this time. Background and Supporting Information When performed for liver lesion evaluation, a multiphase CT protocol may include non- contrast imaging as well as arterial, portal venous, and delayed-phase post-contrast imaging. However, these protocols do not always require non-contrast imaging which may not provide additional information in many scenarios. Therefore, a multiphase CT for liver lesion evaluation can be requested as 74160 (CT Abdomen with contrast) or CPT\u00ae 74170 (CT Abdomen without and with contrast). The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) revised its guidelines with respect to surveillance for HCC in patients with cirrhosis in 2018. The Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCAbdomen Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 recommended algorithm now includes either US alone or US with serum AFP every 6 months. It should be noted that \"modification of this surveillance strategy based on the etiology of liver diseases or risk stratification models cannot be recommended at this time.\"1 In addition, the AASLD also issued a subsequent Practice Guidance in 2018 and this document forms the basis of eviCore's guidelines. The AASLD has adopted the Li- RADS classification of liver lesions with respect to HCC surveillance imaging for patients with advanced liver disease, and follow-up imaging protocols are based on this system. In view of this, the Li-RADS classification now informs imaging protocols used by eviCore. (Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis) vs. PBC (Primary Biliary These 2 entities sound similar, and both are cholestatic, but they are different diseases, and as such have different monitoring requirements. PSC is an idiopathic cholestatic disease characterized by chronic inflammation, progressive fibrosis, and stricturing of the medium creates characteristic beaded appearance on a cholangiogram, such as MRCP. This may progress and eventually lead to cirrhosis as well. It is most commonly associated with inflammatory bowel disease. From a surveillance standpoint, PSC may be complicated by disease-associated malignancies, including cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer. Thus, follow-up imaging in this setting is generally via MRCP +/- MRI Abdomen is a complex, chronic, and slowly progressive autoimmune liver disease that predominately affects women, and is characterized by cholestatic liver biochemistries as well as the presence of AMA (Anti-Mitochondrial Antibodies), and results in T- lymphocyte-mediated destruction of small intrahepatic bile ducts. This may ultimately lead to cirrhosis, and thus an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Because of this, surveillance via US screening protocols for HCC are followed in PBC. It may be necessary, when the diagnosis of PBC is uncertain, for an MRCP to be performed in order to distinguish between PBC and PSC. However, MRI or MRCP is not used for serial monitoring for PBC, once the diagnosis is established. This is in contradistinction to PSC, in which MRCP is used to surveil for cholangiocarcinoma, as discussed above. Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Further advanced imaging is determined by the nature of etiology of the ascites (e.g., portal hypertension secondary to cirrhosis, malignancy such as ovarian or pancreatic, heart failure, etc.). Peritoneal-venous shunt patency study (CPT\u00ae 78291) is considered for evaluation of shunt patency and function in an individual with ascites Background and Supporting Information Guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (2021) indicates that the initial evaluation of patients with ascites should include a medical history, physical examination, abdominal US with Doppler, lab studies including CBC, Liver function tests, serum and urine electrolytes and paracentesis with ascitic fluid analysis, which then guides further management. They specifically note that \"A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in all patients with new-onset ascites that is accessible for sampling\". Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

For additional imaging indications, see: Hepatic Arteries and Veins (AB-43.1) Certain requests are made for advanced imaging to evaluate an individual with cirrhosis for the presence of esophageal varices. In general, and in the absence of a contraindication, endoscopy should be performed in individuals to assess for the presence of varices. Background and Supporting Information Most cases of portal hypertension are caused by cirrhosis, and the most feared complication is that of esophageal variceal hemorrhage. Causes of portal hypertension can be divided into prehepatic (e.g. portal vein thrombosis, extrinsic compression from a tumor), intrahelpatic (e.g. cirrhosis) and post-hepatic (e.g. hepatic vein thrombosis) causes. The differentiation of some of these causes may require work-up which includes measurement of the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) which is considered the gold standard for the evaluation of portal hypertension. The gold standard for the assessment of portal hypertension is the Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient (HPVG [pressure gradient between portal vein and the inferior vena cava]), which is an invasive test.

In addition, the congestive hepatopathy associated with the Fontan procedure makes differentiation of focal liver lesions from congestive changes more challenging than other cirrhotic conditions. Thus most institutions use MRI rather than US for monitoring in the setting of cirrhosis. In addition, the evaluation for HCC is challenging due to the vascular changes associated with the Fontan procedure, because the typical HCC pattern of delayed venous-phase contrast washout may not be appreciated within the background congestive hepatopathy. Thus, biopsy is usually required. Also, distinguishing dysplastic lesions from true HCC based on LiRADS criteria is very challenging as well. There are no current society endorsed guidelines, and institutions may vary in the monitoring of chronic liver disease in this patient population. The above algorithm represents an accepted approach and is consistent with the consensus from the Fontan-Associated Liver Disease proceedings from the American College of Cardiology Shareholders Meeting (2015) as well as the consensus of a multidisciplinary group of American Society of Transplantation members (2020).

This is based on the invasive and costly nature of testing, the inherent difficulty in screening given the structural changes of CP , and the inability to alter in many cases the natural history of the disease even if malignancy is detected at an early stage.\" Therefore, routine surveillance to monitor for the occurrence of pancreatic cancer in individuals with chronic pancreatitis is not supported at this time.

Background and Supporting Information Our current guidelines are consistent with ACR recommendations for the follow-up of incidental splenic masses. It is noteworthy, however, that a recent study from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in which the authors retrospectively reviewed 379 patients who were found to have an incidental splenic mass on CT found that in patients without a history of malignancy, constitutional symptoms of fever or weight loss, or left upper quadrant or epigastric pain (205/379) there were 2 incidences of malignancy. However, in both of these cases the splenic masses were neither isolated nor indeterminate findings as the CTs demonstrated disease in other locations. An isolated splenic malignancy (which can occur but is very rare) was found only in 2 patients and both of these had constitutional symptoms. Thus, the authors claim that \"the isolated and incidentally found splenic mass is of unlikely clinical significance, regardless of its appearance\", They concluded that \"in patients with an incidental splenic mass identified at imaging and with the absence of a history of malignancy, fever, weight loss, or pain in the left upper quadrant or epigastrium, such masses are highly likely to be benign regardless of their appearance. Additional imaging or follow- up is not warranted, even if the mass does not show the appearance of simple cyst. Further work-up is only needed if the splenic mass is seen in conjunction with other findings worrisome for malignancy\". These authors challenge the use of the ACR guidelines.

See: Blunt Abdominal Trauma (AB-10) Background and Supporting Information Splenomegaly is usually the result of systemic disease, and diagnostic studies are directed toward identifying the causative disease. Complete blood count with differential, LFT's, and peripheral blood smear examination are often performed prior to considering advanced imaging.

There have been recent attempts to establish evidence-based guidelines, including the development of the RETREAT score, validated recently in a study conducted at University of California, San Francisco, Mayo Clinic-Rochester, and Mayo Clinic-Jacksonville. This scoring system has been adopted for use by UCSF and guides post-transplant imaging for individuals who have undergone transplant for HCC. The RETREAT score is a protocol used to estimate the risk of tumor recurrence after liver transplantation in patients who have been transplanted for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. It is comprised of 3 factors which are assessed before and after transplant. Points are assigned based on criteria which include the alpha- fetoprotein level before liver transplantation, the presence or absence of microvascular invasion, and the sum of the diameter of the largest viable tumor and the number of viable nodules on pathologic examination of the explant liver. The RETREAT score is calculated as follows: Risk Factor Score Alpha-fetoprotein level before LT 0-20 0 21-99 1 100-999 2 1000 3 Microvascular invasion present 2 Sum of the diameter of the largest viable tumor and the number of viable nodules 0 0 1.1-4.9 1 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCAbdomen Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 Background and Supporting Information For the assessment of cirrhosis in individuals with hepatitis C, the AGA noted that MRE has little to no increase in identifying cirrhosis, but had poorer specificity and thus higher false-positive rates than VCTE. In view of this, the AGA concluded that MRE has a poorer diagnostic performance in this setting, compared to VCTE. In their recommendations for the assessment of fibrosis in chronic liver disease, VCTE was recommended over MRE with the exception of NAFLD in high risk populations, in which MRE resulted in a lower rate of false positives compared to VCTE. This was considered a conditional recommendation with a low quality of evidence. The role of MRE was reviewed again in 2019 (Castera, et. al.) in Gastroenterology8 and the pathway recommendations form the basis of our current guideline with respect to the role of MRE in fatty liver disease.

It is not expected to change over the follow -up interval, but the radiologist would prefer to establish its stability. Data is becoming available that sheds light on the efficacy of short interval follow -up. At the present time, most approaches are intuitive. These will likely undergo future modification as more data accrue as to the validity of an approach, the interval required, and the type of findings that should be followed. Category 4: Suspicious Abnormality - Biopsy Should Be Considered There are lesions that do not have the characteristic morphologies of breast cancer but have a definite probability of being malignant. The radiologist has sufficient concern to urge a biopsy. If possible, the relevant possibilities should be cited so that the individual and her physician can make the decision on the ultimate course of action. Category 5: Highly Suggestive of Malignancy - Appropriate Action Should Be Taken These lesions have a high probability of being cancer and should be biopsied or treated surgically.

State Specific Density Reporting and Imaging Mandate Laws Breast density notification laws have been put into effect by many states. Breast density notification laws vary, but some also contai n mandates for additional imaging, which may include MRI and/or ultrasound. For applicable requests involving members in these states, their legislative mandates should be followed. Phyllodes Tumor (Cystosarcoma Phyllodes) Phyllodes tumor is usually benig n and has clinical characteristics of fibroadenoma, although they may exhibit rapid growth. MRI Breast has not been shown to be of value in distinguishing fibroadenoma from phyllodes tumor. Diagnosis is made by tissue diagnosis (percutaneous core biopsy or excisional biopsy). FNA biopsy is inaccurate in phyllodes tumor diagnosis and is not recommended. Treatment is wide local excision. Axillary lymph node dissection is not necessary. It has a predilection for local recurrence following local excision. If biopsy establishes a diagnosis of malignant phyllodes (cystosarcoma phyllodes), it should be treated as a soft tissue sarcoma (See Sarcomas - Bone, Soft Tissue and GIST (ONC -12) in the Oncology Imaging Guidelines ).18,19,20 Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Background and Supporting Information CT Breast CT Breast is evolving and currently being studied as a mode of breast cancer detection. It remains under investigation, and is not to be used in lieu of conventional breast imaging modalities . Positron Emission Mammography There is currently insufficient data available to generate appropriateness criteria for this modality, and this procedure should be considered investigational at this time High-resolution positron- emission mammography (PEM) by Naviscan PET Systems, also referred to as Naviscan or PET mammography, performs high- resolution metabolic imaging for breast cancer using an FDG tracer. The PEM detectors are integrated into a conventional mammography system, allowing acquisition of the emission images immediately after the mammogram. Requesting providers often ask for PEM as CPT \u00ae 78811 or \"PET scan of the breast \". The spatial resolution of this technique is at the individual duct level (1.5 mm) and allows visualization of intraductal as well as invasive breast cancers. This technique is especially adept at detecting ductal carcinoma in situ. Early clinical trials have shown high clinical accuracy in characterizing lesions identified as suspicious on conventional imaging or physical examination, as well as in detecting incidental breast cancers not seen on other imaging modalities Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

These females underwent both high- resolution PEM imaging and breast MRI. Results showed that PEM and MRI had comparable breast -level sensitivity, although MRI had greater lesion- level sensitivity and more accurately depicted the need for mastectomy. PEM had greater specificity at the breast and lesion levels. Of these, 3.6% of the females had tumors seen only with PEM. The radiation exposure from a PEM study is 23 times higher than for digital mammography.

Effort should be made to obtain copies of reported \"abnormal\" ECG studies in order to determine whether the ECG is uninterpretable for ischemia on ETT Most recent previous stress testing and its findings should be obtained Other meaningful contact (telephone call, electronic mail or messaging) by an established individual can substitute for a face-to-face clinical evaluation. oVital signs, height and weight, or BMI, or description of general habitus is needed. oClinical question to be answered by advanced imaging that will affect management of the individual's clinical condition. Cardiac imaging is not indicated if the results will not affect clinical management decisions. If a decision to perform cardiac catheterization or other angiography has already been made, there is often no need for imaging stress testing Assessment of ischemic symptoms can be determined by Table-1 Clinical pre-test probability of CAD in individuals with stable chest pain symptoms Clinical pre-test probability of CAD is a statistical tool used in the initial assessment of stable chest pain syndromes to estimate the likelihood that the symptoms are caused by obstructive coronary artery disease using the individual's description of the symptoms, their age, and sex assigned at birth. The pre-test probability for obstructive coronary artery disease as the cause of the symptoms is categorized as the following: High >85% pre-test probability Intermediate/high between probability <15% pre-test probability Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

See Kidney Transplant, Pre-Transplant Imaging Studies (AB-42.5) . oIndividuals who have undergone organ transplant are at increased risk for ischemic heart disease secondary to their medication. Risk of vasculopathy is 7% at one year, 32% at five years and 53% at ten years. An imaging stress test can be repeated annually after transplant for at least two years or within one year of a prior cardiac imaging study if there is evidence of progressive vasculopathy. oAfter two consecutive normal imaging stress tests, repeated testing is not supported more often than every other year without evidence for progressive vasculopathy or new symptoms. oStress testing after five years may proceed according to normal patterns of consideration.

MUGA may be appropriate when a recent ECHO, as indicated in Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) - Indications (CD-2.2) and/or Frequency of Echocardiography Testing (CD 2.3) , was technically limited and prevented accurate assessment of left ventricular function. MUGA may be appropriate when there is a significant discrepancy between LVEF assessment by ECHO and another modality (i.e., one study reports normal LVEF and the other, a reduced LVEF) AND there is clear documentation as to how quantitative measurement of LVEF will affect individual management (e.g., implantation of an ICD, alteration in cardiotoxic chemotherapy, etc.). MUGA may be performed in place of an ECHO in the following circumstances: oTo determine candidacy for ICD/CRT and/or to determine optimal choice of device in individuals who meet criteria for ICD based on ejection fraction and other criteria. oWhen previously or currently undergoing therapy with potentially cardiotoxic agents, including chemotherapy and radiation, AND a history of previous low LV ejection fraction (LVEF <50%). See Cardiotoxic agent/Cancer Therapeutics- Related Cardiac Dysfunction (CD-12.1) MUGA is not indicated when requested simply to compare LVEF by the same modality, a prior MUGA is not a reason to approve another MUGA. Right ventricular first pass study (CPT\u00ae 78472 and 78496) may be performed when ECHO is technically limited and prevents accurate assessment of RV function AND when further information about RV function is needed to guide management (e.g. established/diagnosed pulmonary hypertension, suspected or confirmed pulmonary embolus). First pass studies First pass studies (CPT\u00ae 78481 and CPT\u00ae 78483) may be approved in place of MUGA when indications are met for MUGA and/or there is need for information that cannot be obtained by MUGA.

The AMA has established the following set of Category III codes to report these studies: o0331T - Myocardial sympathetic innervation imaging, planar qualitative and quantitative assessment o0332T - Myocardial sympathetic innervation imaging, planar qualitative and quantitative assessment; with tomographic SPECT. Background and supporting information In heart failure, the sympathetic nervous system is activated in order to compensate for the decreased myocardial function. Initially, this is beneficial, however, long-term this compensatory mechanism is detrimental and causes further damage. Markers have been developed, using radioactive iodine, in an attempt to image this increased myocardial sympathetic activity. Currently, AdreView (Iodine-123 meta- iodobenzylguanidine), is the only FDA-approved imaging agent available for this purpose. Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Information can then be used to change the operative strategy including non-midline approach, peripheral vascular exposure, and alternative cannulation sites and for establishing cardiopulmonary bypass before re-sternotomy. These techniques can result in decreased incidence of intraoperative injury to heart, great vessels and prior bypass grafts and lower rates of postoperative stroke. IV contrast is necessary with these studies to delineate the anatomic structures. However, in individuals with renal insufficiency, the provider might choose to forgo the contrast if does not want to contrast load the individual prior to placing them on the heart-lung machine. Aortic atherosclerosis is recognized as the single most important determinant of postoperative stroke. There is evidence to support that preoperative CT is associated with lower postoperative stroke rates and mortality after primary cardiac surgery. oCT Chest without contrast (CPT\u00ae 71250) can be performed pre-operatively to allow the surgeon to: Visualize the extent and location of aortic atherosclerosis Change the operative strategy such as those problematic areas are avoided Primary Cardiac Surgery - No Previous Cardiac Surgery (CD-13.2) CT Chest without contrast (CPT\u00ae 71250) to evaluate for the presence of ascending aortic calcifications may be indicated prior to primary cardiac surgery when there is documented high risk for aortic calcification including any of the following: oAortic calcification on chest x-ray or other diagnostic test (TEE, fluoroscopy, etc.) oCalcific aortic stenosis Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCCardiac Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 oEnd stage renal disease (dialysis) Re-operative cardiac surgery (CD-13.3) Individuals undergoing re-operative cardiac surgery may undergo one of the following tests for preoperative assessment: oCT Chest with contrast oCTA Chest oCCTA only if prior CABG (this might be in addition to CT with contrast as CCTA will not show the extent of the thoracic aorta that needs to be visualized) oCT Heart usually does not provide the necessary information, and should not be approved routinely. Minimally Invasive Valve Surgery (CD-13.4) See Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) (CD-4.8) For an individual undergoing minimally invasive aortic valve surgery and minimally invasive or robotic mitral valve surgery, ONE of the following for preoperative assessment of an individual's suitability for the approach and for subsequent procedure planning: CTA Chest, CTA Abdomen and Pelvis CT Chest and CT Abdomen and Pelvis with Mitral Valve valve clip) (CD-13.5) Percutaneous treatment of mitral regurgitation can be accomplished using venous access to apply a clip device (e.g., MitraClip currently FDA approved) to provide edge-to-edge mitral leaflet coaptation, approximating opposing sections of the anterior and posterior mitral valve leaflets. FDA approved indications include treatment for individuals with symptomatic, moderate to severe or severe primary mitral regurgitation whose surgical risks are prohibitive, as well as symptomatic moderate to severe or severe secondary mitral regurgitation who have failed optimal medical therapy. This therapy should include, if indicated, cardiac resynchronization therapy. The following imaging may be used to determine if an individual is eligible for the procedure: oTransthoracic echo with or without 3D rendering oTransesophageal echo with or without 3D rendering oHeart catheterization, including right heart cath if requested Because this is a venous approach, CTA of Abdomen, Chest, and/or Pelvis is not indicated. Post procedure transthoracic echo (TTE) can be performed at the following intervals: oOne month oSix months Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

More limited hypertrophy (13-14 mm) can be diagnostic, particularly when present in family members of a patient with HCM or in conjunction with a positive genetic test, and/or associated with typical dynamic outflow obstruction, or distinctly abnormal ECG patterns. Long QT Syndrome (LQTS): \u2014 A congenital disorder characterized by a prolongation of the QT interval on ECG and a propensity to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, which may lead to syncope, cardiac arrest, or sudden death. The QT interval on the ECG, measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave, represents the duration of activation and recovery of the ventricular myocardium. QT intervals corrected for heart rate (QTc) longer than 0.44 seconds are generally considered abnormal, though a normal QTc can be more prolonged in females (up to 0.46 sec).The Bazett formula is the formula most commonly used to calculate the QTc, as follows: QTc = AT/square root of the R-R interval (in seconds). Click Here to Return to Main TOC Non-Compaction Cardiomyopathy: \u2014 A rare congenital cardiomyopathy that affects children and adults. It results from the failure of myocardial development during embryogenesis. It is also called spongiform cardiomyopathy. Symptoms are often a result of a poor pumping performance by the heart. The disease can be associated with other problems with the heart and the body. Non-Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia (NSVT): \u2014 Three or more consecutive ventricular beats at a rate of greater than 120 beats/min with a duration of less than 30 seconds Optimal Medical Therapy: \u2014 Three months of heart failure medications in maximally titrated doses as tolerated. These include beta blockers, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, and diuretics. Structural Heart Disease: \u2014 A structural or functional abnormality of the heart, or of the blood vessels supplying the heart, that impairs its normal functioning.

The guidelines undergo a formal review annually. eviCore's guidelines are based upon major national and international association and society guidelines and criteria, peer-reviewed literature, major treatises, and input from health plans, practicing academic and community-based physicians. These guidelines are not intended to supersede or replace sound medical judgment, but instead should facilitate the identification of the most appropriate imaging procedure, given the patient's clinical condition. These guidelines are written to cover medical conditions as experienced by the majority of patients. However, these guidelines may not be applicable in certain clinical circumstances, and physician judgment can override the guidelines. Clinical decisions, including treatment decisions, are the responsibility of the patient and his/her provider. Clinicians are expected to use independent medical judgment which takes into account the clinical circumstances to determine patient management decisions. eviCore supports the Choosing Wisely\u00ae initiative (www.choosingwisely.org) by the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Foundation and many national physician organizations, to reduce the overuse of diagnostic tests that are low value, no value, or whose risks are greater than the benefits. eviCore's guidelines are based upon expert consensus and analysis reported by the following specialty societies, publications, studies and trials: oThe American College of Cardiology (ACC) oThe American Heart Association (AHA) oThe Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) Multicenter Automatic for Ambulatory Heart Failure Trial (RAFT) oThe Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT) oThe Resynchronization Reverses Remodeling in Systolic Left Ventricular Dysfunction trial (REVERSE) oImmediate Risk Stratification Improves Survival trial (IRIS) Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

A list of the currently approved studies is available at: http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coverage/Coverage-with-Evidence- Development/Index. Clinical and Research Trials Similar to investigational and experimental studies, clinical trial imaging requests will be considered to determine whether they meet health plan coverage and eviCore's evidence-based guidelines State and federal legislations may need to be considered in the review of advanced imaging requests References 1.

Journal of Oncology Practice. 2007;3(6):296-301. doi:10.1200/jop.0763501 Clinical information (Preface-3) The philosophy behind eviCore guidelines entails using an evidence-based approach to determine the most appropriate procedure for each individual, at the most appropriate time in the diagnostic and treatment cycle. Procedures should be requested after initial consultation and physician treatment planning, and following full counseling of the individual. Current clinical information, which may include history, physical examination, symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging reports, are necessary for determining the medical necessity of implantable cardiac devices. The information provided to eviCore should have clinical relevance to the request. If the information provided makes no reference to the potential indication for the request, then the medical necessity for the procedure(s) cannot be supported.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Chest Imaging Guidelines Click Here to Return to Main TOCBackground and Supporting Information Adenocarcinoma is the most common histology, with breast cancer seen most often; non-palpable breast cancer and axillary metastases accounts for less than 0.5% of all breast cancers. Carcinomas of the lung, thyroid, stomach, colon, rectum, andpancreas have the potential to spread to axillary lymph nodes, but these metastasesare rarely the first manifestations of disease. COVID -19 vaccine- related unilateral axillary adenopathy has been well documented to occur in 12% of recipients after the first dose and up to 16% after the seconddose. 1 In some series the inciden ce has been as high as 53%.2 Adenopathy usually develops within the first few days after vaccination and last s a mean of 10 days . However 29% had lymphadenopathy which persisted >6 weeks.3 PET-CT can provide false positive results of unilateral axillary adenopathy up to 7- 10 weeks post vaccination. Due to these concerns, in individuals with cancer history it isrecommended that the vaccination be provided in the contralateral arm, especially incase of unilateral breast cancer. The Society for Breast Imaging recommends that for unilateral axillary adenopathyon screening exams who received a COVID -19 vaccination in the ipsilateral upper extremity within the preceding 4 weeks, consider a short term follow up exam in 4- 12 weeks following the second vaccine dose. If axillary adenopathy persists after shortterm follow up, then consider lymph node sampling to exclude breast and non- breast malignancy. 4 Imaging for urgent cancer related clinical indication should not be delayed in relationship to COVID vaccine timing. For routine surveillance, screeningand similar non- urgent indications, postponement of imaging for at least 6 weeks after vaccinations should be considered. 5 Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy (CH-2.3) CT Chest with contrast (CPT\u00ae 71260) if mediastinal abnormalities are detected on a chest x -ray (over read by a radiol ogist) , other non- dedicated advanced chest imaging, or clarification of mediastinal abnormalities on a non- contrast CT months if: Enlarged lymph nodes , 15 mm, are in the mediastinum with no other thoracic abnormalities; and Low risk or no clinical suspicion for malignancy . Thereafter, stability or decreasing size, does not require further advanced imaging. Further evaluations Lymph node biopsy (see methods below) should be considered for: Persistent or increasing lymphadenopathy on follow -up CT Chest ; or Suspected malignancy . See Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (O NC-27) and/or Lymphoma PET/CT (CPT\u00ae 78815 ) can be considered for enlarged lymph nodes, 15 mm with no explainable disease or increasing lymph node size on follow -up CT Chest Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Chest Imaging Guidelines Click Here to Return to Main TOCBackground and Supporting Information Incidentally detected lymph nodes <15 mm (in short axis) in individuals with no other findings do not require further evaluation. Most benign nodes have smooth and well -defined borders, show uniform and homogeneous attenuation, and demonstrate a central fatty hilum Explainable disease such as emphysema, interstitial Unexplained causes, consider lymphoma, undiagnosed metastatic disease, including testicular carcinoma in young male, and infection. Lymphadenopathy from neoplasms as well as from benign sources of inflammationcan result in a positive PET scan. Therefore, the use of PET may not be helpful priorto histologic diagnosis. Less invasive methods of mediastinal and traditional methods are mediastinoscopy orthoracoscopy/thoracotomy. References 1.Mehta N, Sales RM, Babagbemi K, et al.

There are a multitude of pathologies that demonstrate involvement of the alveola, airways,or both, in addition to the pulmonary interstitium. A single term of ILD would not fullyaddress the entities that are mostly parenchymal in nature, hence the term DiffuseLung Disease is more technically correct. Both terms are included here forconvenience and recognition. There is no relevant literature to support the use of CT with IV contrast for initial or follow- up imaging of ILD; however, IV contrast may be of use in evaluation of alternative diagnoses with overlapping clinical features or conditions that alsoinvolve the pleura, mediastinum, and pulmonary vessels Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Symptomati c post -COVID individuals with concern for interstitial lung disease including organizing pneumonia imaging can be considered pre and post treatment.11 Background and Suppor ting Information The role of advanced imaging in the diagnosis and management of COVID- 19 is very dynamic in this rapidly evolving condition. Findings on both Chest X -ray and CT Chest are non- specific. Chest X -rays may show patchy opacities with lower lung predominance. CT may show peripheralmultifocal ground glass opacities with lower lung predominance. However, asignificant portion of cases have opacities without a clear or specific distribution. 3,4,6 Pediatric individual s may have less pronounced imaging findings than adults. Major professional society guidelines to date: The American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends that CT Chest should not be used for screening or as a first -line test to diagnose COVID -19. 3 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends viral testing as the only specific method of diagnosis.4 The CDC has s tated that symptoms may appear 2- 14 days after exposure to the virus. These symptoms may include:5 Fever or chi lls Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Fatigue Muscle or body aches Headache New loss of taste or smell Sore throat Congestion or runny nose Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea The Fleischner Society consensus statement published on April 7, 2020, recommends against the use of imaging in individual s with suspected COVID -19 who are either asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms without evidence of significant pulmonary dysfunction or damage (e.g., absence of hypoxemia, no or mild dyspnea). 6 According to The American Society of Transplantation, screening donors is based on methods below. Screening donors encompasses three different methods. 7 Epidemiologic screening for travel and potential exposures Screening for symptoms suggestive of COVID -19 Viral testing (Nucleic acid testing of specimens) There is no current indication for screening asymptomatic donors with advanced imaging Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Solitary Pulmonary Nodule - Imaging ( CH-16.1) For these guidelines, manual nodule measurements should be based on theaverage of long- and short -axis diameters. The size threshold (<6 mm) corresponds to a rounded measurement of 5 mm or less in these guidelines. Prediction models used to estimate malignancy yield better results with the average diameter tha n with the maximum transverse diameter. For larger nodules and for masses larger than 10 mm, it is generally appropriate to record both long- and short -axis dimensions, with the long- axis dimension being used to determine the T factor in lung cancer staging and being a criterion for tumor response to treatment. 1 CT Chest wi th contrast (CPT\u00ae 71260) or CT Chest without contrast (CPT\u00ae 71250) initially for discrete nodule(s) in the following scenarios:1,2,3 Lung nodule(s) s een on an imaging study other than a \"dedicated\" CT or MR I Chest .

False negative PET can be seen in individual s with adenocarcinoma in situ (formally known as bronchoalveolar carcinoma), carcinoid tumors, a small size nodule, non- solid or ground glass opacity. 9 High pre- test likelihood of malignancy with negative findings on PET only reduces the likelihood of malignancy to 14%; while in a n individual with a low pre -test likelihood (20%) of malignancy, a negative PET reduces the likelihood of malignancy to 1%.6 Individual s aged 35 years or younger1 Considered t o have an overall low risk for pulmonary malignancy In this age group, nodules are most likely to be infectious rather than cancer Management of incidentally -found pulmonary nodules in this group should be individualized Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain and tachypnea occur with about 50%incidence with leg swelling or pain just over 50%. D-dimer level has a high sensitivity and low specificity for diagnosing PE. A negative D -dimer in combination with low or moderate PE risk classification has a negative predictive value approaching 100%. D-dimer can be falsely elevated with recent surgery, injury, malignancy, sepsis, diabetes, pregnancy, or other conditions where fibrin products are likely to be present. CT imaging has supplanted V/Q scanning since the latter is difficult to obtain quickly,does not provide a substantial cost savings, and does not diagnose other pulmonary pathology. The decision to terminate anticoagulation treatment after previous pulmonary embolism (PE) with absent or stable symptoms is based on clinical evaluation andrisk factors. Repeat studies do not allow one the ability to distinguish new from residual clot, withluminal diameter and clot character poorly correlated to symptoms and ECHOfindings. Two thirds of individuals with primary thromboembolism have residual pulmonary artery clot a t 6 months and 50% remain at one year. Subsequent persistence or elevation of D -dimer is associated with increased risk of recurrent PE. ECHO and Right Heart Catheterization (RHC) can identify those withpulmonary hypertension. Yet, 1/2 of all have persistent or new pulmonaryhypertension after primary thromboembolism and only half of this latter group hasdyspnea at rest or exercise intolerance. Of note, pregnancy is accompanied by a progressive increase in D -dimer levels and as such, D -Dimer levels may not be helpful to rule- in or rule- out DVT/PE in pregnancy . 11,12 Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

MRA Upper extremity (CPT \u00ae 73225) or CTA Upper extremity (CPT\u00ae 73206) can be performed in symptomatic individual s if needed to exclude pathology distal to the subclavian artery and if they will substitute for invasive angiography. See Stroke /TIA (HD-21.1) (for vertebrobasilar stroke) in the Head Imaging Guidelines. Treatment options include ligation of the ipsilateral vertebral artery, aorta- subclavian artery bypass graft, or subclavian endarterectomy. Background and Supporting Information While MRA does not expose the individual to radiation, CTA should be considered the test of choice for subclavian steal syndrome given its superior spatial and temporal resolution. Satisfying the symptom complex. Physical examination findings suggestive of subclavian stenosis include adiscrepancy of >15 mmHg in blood pressure readings taken in both upper extremities, delayed or decreased amplified pulses in the affected side, and a bruit in the supraclavicular area on the affected side. Symptoms include vertebral basilar artery insufficiency, vertigo, disturbances, ataxia, syncope, and dysarthria occur less frequently.

Postoperative individual s in whom there is a question regarding a remnant first rib. Dialysis -dependent renal failure, claustrophobia, or implanted device incompatibility. See Brachial Plexus (PN-4 .1) in the Per ipheral Nerve Disorders Imaging Guidelines . Background and Supporting Information TOS refers to compr ession of the subclavian vessels and/or brachial plexus at the thoracic outlet of the chest (the area bounded by the two scalene muscles and the first rib). There are 3 types, with neurogenic causes seen in 80%, venous causes (also calledeffort thrombosis) found in 15% and the remaining 5% being arterial in etiology. Since this is such a rare entity and diagnosis is difficult, specialist evaluation by a vascu lar surgeon or thoracic surgeon is helpful in determining the appropriate imaging pathway.

The basic pathology involves accumulation of tau proteins in the brain rather than amyloid. Onset tends to be younger (less than 65) and progression usually more rapid than in senile dementia-Alzheimer type (SDAT). There is no treatment, and the medications used to help memory in Alzheimer's disease are not effective. There are several subtypes of FTD; most common are the behavioral variant with early loss of executive functions, impaired judgment disinhibition and impulsivity, and the semantic variant with primary and progressive loss of language ability. Other less common subtypes include progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome, and FTD associated with motor neuron disease. Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCHead Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 Diagnosis is based on clinical features, neuropsychological testing, and brain imaging (preferably MRI) to rule out other structural disease.

Over time people with LBD often develop similar symptoms due to the presence of Lewy bodies in the brain. oClinicians and researchers may use the \"1-year rule\" to help make a diagnosis. If cognitive, psychiatric, emotional, and/or personality symptoms appear at the same time as or at least a year before movement problems/parkinsonism, the diagnosis is dementia with Lewy bodies. If cognitive problems develop more than a year after the onset of movement problems, Parkinson's disease, the diagnosis is Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). Core Symptoms oDementia oMovement problems/parkinsonism oCognitive fluctuations oVisual hallucinations oREM sleep behavior Supportive Clinical Symptoms oExtreme sensitivity to antipsychotic medications oFalls, fainting oSevere problems with involuntary functions (maintaining blood pressure, incontinence, constipation, loss of smell) oChanges in personality and mood (depression, apathy, anxiety) Prior to consideration of SPECT Brain Scan for a diagnosis of LBD, all of the following components are required: oEstablished diagnosis of dementia: date of onset of symptoms with documentation of 6 months of cognitive decline based on a detailed history of memory loss with impairment of day-to-day activities confirmed by family members or others with knowledge of the individual's status OR oResults of bedside testing and/or neuropsychological testing can be performed when history and bedside mental status examination cannot provide a confident diagnosis.

It comprises a triad of symptoms: cognitive dysfunction, incontinence of urine, and gait disturbance (typically a \"magnetic\", small-step, or broad based gait). The reported neuroradiologic marker for this is ventriculomegaly (enlarged ventricles) in the brain. Unfortunately, these symptoms and this neuroradiologic finding is common in the elderly, making the diagnosis of NPH in any given individual problematic. It is radiographically common and clinically rare. Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCHead Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 Cerebrospinal ventriculovenous shunts. Background and Supporting Information Ventriculomegaly is the condition where ventricles are enlarged, and this may be due to 1) hydrocephalus, a condition of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) (imaging shows ventricles are disproportionately enlarged compared to sulci), or 2) brain atrophy, most commonly related to age or trauma, which is not associated with increased ICP (imaging shows ventricles and sulci are proportionately enlarged). Hydrocephalus is divided into obstructive/non-communicating vs. communicating types, and these usually have different etiologies and radiographic features. Obstructive or non-communicating hydrocephalus classically involves an intraventricular obstruction in which CSF flow over the convexities and between the ventricles is reduced, and the proximal ventricle(s) is/are dilated. This is a medical emergency. Communicating hydrocephalus involves extraventricular obstruction, poor absorption or overproduction of CSF. There is normal intracranial CSF flow and absence of disproportionate ventricular dilation, yet there is still a mildly increased CSF pressure. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is an example of this type. Distinguishing between ventriculomegaly due to brain atrophy and non- communicating hydrocephalus can be difficult with MRI Brain or CT Head alone, and modalities which visualize CSF flow may be useful such as cisternography or CT cisternography.

AVMs most often come to clinical notice either by bleeding or by acting as a seizure focus. They are usually congenital, recognized later in life and have an initial risk of bleeding of 2% per year. Cerebral angiography is a form of angiography which provides images of blood vessels in and around the brain and/or neck.

Background and Supporting Information oParesthesia refers to an abnormal sensation that is associated with nervous system dysfunction and may be described as a tingling, pricking, pins and needles, or a burning sensation. The priority is to determine whether the etiology is due to pathology of the peripheral or central nervous system. oA thorough clinical history, including symptom location and time course, can be helpful to differentiate between the two. For example, paresthesia affecting one side of the face and/or body (i.e. hemisensory deficit) points strongly towards central nervous system dysfunction. Therefore, MRI Brain (CPT\u00ae 70551 or CPT\u00ae 70553), MRI or CPT\u00ae 72157) could be warranted, especially based on the location of symptoms. Typically, lumbar spine imaging is not indicated unless there is sphincter involvement, saddle anesthesia, and/or cauda equina syndrome is suspected. In contrast, an insidious course of distal, symmetric limb paresthesia is more commonly associated with peripheral nerve abnormalities. In such case, NCS/ EMG testing results should be completed prior to advanced imaging. (See Peripheral Nerve Imaging Guidelines ). oA detailed neurological exam is most essential in determining whether advanced imaging is indicated. The presence of upper motor neuron signs (e.g. increased tone, hyperreflexia, presence of Babinski or Hoffman signs) necessitates central nervous system imaging. Conversely, lower motor neuron signs (e.g. decreased tone, hypo- or areflexia, muscle atrophy) can indicate that nerve conduction and needle EMG testing should be completed in order to evaluate for neuropathy or other peripheral nervous system diseases. It is important to note that both peripheral and central nervous system disease can co-exist. As a result, if both upper and lower motor neuron signs are observed simultaneously, advanced imaging is appropriate regardless of NCS/EMG testing results.

Background and Supporting Information *Acromegaly: A serum level of growth hormone greater than 1ng/mL when measured two hours following an oral glucose load confirms acromegaly. **Cushing's Disease: It is important to differentiate Cushing's syndrome (hypercortisolism from any source) from Cushing's disease which is ACTH hypersecretion from the pituitary gland. Hypercortisolism is quantified by 24hour urine cortisol collection, low dose dexamethasone suppression test and/or late night Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCHead Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 salivary cortisol measurement. ACTH is elevated in Cushing's disease and ectopic sources of ACTH production, but suppressed in other causes of hypercortisolism. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test can help determine if the elevated ACTH is from a pituitary or ectopic source. Petrosal sinus sampling may be required for tumor localization preoperatively in the setting of a normal pituitary MRI or a small adenoma. These tumors may be managed with surgery, medical therapy, radiation and/or bilateral adrenalectomy. ***Prolactinoma: To establish the diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia, a single measurement of serum prolactin is recommended; a level above the upper limit of normal confirms the diagnosis as long as the serum sample was obtained without excessive venipuncture stress. Pregnancy and primary hypothyroidism should be excluded as physiologic causes of prolactin elevation and medications that may be contributing to prolactin elevation should be considered. Dopamine agonist therapy is typically stopped during pregnancy, monitoring of prolactin levels ceases. Routine imaging surveillance during pregnancy is not recommended due to risk to fetus. Repeat imaging with MRI without gadolinium can be performed however for new or worsening symptoms, such as headaches or visual symptoms. **** Medication-induced prolactin elevation : Medication induced hyperprolactinemia is seen most commonly with antipsychotics/neuroleptics and antidepressants, but may also be seen with some anti-emetics and antihypertensive agents. In individuals on prolactin elevating drugs, a prolactin level should be repeated after withdrawal of medications for 72 h, however, this approach may not be safe if this treatment is offered for psychiatric indications. If stopping the drug is not feasible, pituitary MRI is advised to rule out a sellar/parasellar tumor.22 *****TSH, FSH, or LH producing adenomas: These are the least common of all hormonally active pituitary tumors. Individuals with TSH secreting adenomas have inappropriate TSH elevation in the setting of hyperthyroidism (elevated thyroid hormone levels). Almost all gonadotroph adenomas are clinically non-functioning. The infrequent presentation of a functioning gonadotroph adenoma should be differentiated clinically from appropriate FSH and LH elevation seen in low estrogen states (including menopause) as well as primary hypogonadism (testicular failure). Functioning TSH, FSH or LH pituitary adenomas may be managed with surgical, radiation and/or medical therapies. ******Male Hypogonadism: Alterations in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) can impact testosterone levels. Free or bioavailable testosterone concentrations should be measured when total testosterone concentrations are close to the lower limit of the normal range and when altered SHBG levels are suspected (e.g. moderate obesity, nephrotic syndrome, hypo- and hyperthyroidism, use of androgenic anticonvulsants, disease, liver cirrhosis, hepatitis). LH and FSH should be obtained to evaluate for secondary (central) hypogonadism, once low testosterone level is confirmed. Morning testosterone level is drawn anytime before 10 am for a typical sleep-wake cycle. \"Central hypothyroidism is an anatomic or functional disorder of the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, resulting in altered TSH secretion.

Most commonly affects children in the preadolescent ages Several key imaging findings can be used to differentiate the tumors in this region including the presence of calcifications, cysts, and T1/T2 enhancement patterns in craniopharyngiomas oThese are best evaluated using a COMBINATION of both MRI and CT modalities. Preoperative prediction is much more successful when BOTH modalities are obtained prior to biopsy. Other less common tumors in the optic chiasm, sella, and suprasella region may include Germ Cell Tumors (Germinomatous Germ Cell Tumors (GCT) See CNS Germinomas and Non-Germinomatous Cell 4.7) Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) (PEDONC-18.2) in the Pediatric Oncology Imaging Guidelines Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Central nervous system vasculitis typically presents with headache, followed by encephalopathy and behavioral changes. Focal neurologic deficits, including but not limited to, visual loss, unilateral weakness, language impairment, sensory loss, incoordination, occurs in 20% to 30% of individuals. Seizures and intracranial hemorrhage may also occur. With a strong clinical suspicion, brain imaging is important for supporting the diagnostic process and directing biopsy.6 Primary central nervous system vasculitis includes Giant Cell Arteritis also known as Temporal Arteritis.

Transcranial Doppler Studies for individuals with (HD-24.8)) FDG-PET is not supported due to lack of peer reviewed literature or expert consensus supporting the study for vasculitis. Advanced imaging studies, or other procedures, are considered investigational and experimental if there is a paucity of supporting evidence; if the evidence has not matured to exhibit improved health parameters or; the advanced imaging study/procedure lacks a collective opinion of support For extra-cranial giant cell arteritis evaluation, See Giant Cell Arteritis (PVD-6.9.2) Background and Supporting Information Classification of vasculitides based on vessel size adapted from Younger. MRA and CTA are useful for the evaluation of the large proximal arteries; evaluation of a possible small vessel vasculitis may be beyond the resolution of routine MRA and CTA Head. However, other abnormalities, such as atherosclerotic disease, arterial dissection, Moyamoya disease, or reversible cerebral vasoconstriction may be demonstrated.

(See Background and Supporting Information below). Background and Supporting Information Dizziness, a common complaint, with benign and dangerous causes, may be continuous, triggered, or spontaneous. For the continuously dizzy individual with nystagmus at the time of evaluation, a head impulse test and a test of skew should be performed to determine if dizziness is due to a peripheral cause or a posterior circulation stroke. Abnormalities on exam may be indications for imaging as detailed below. For triggered dizziness, positional testing such as the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, and/or orthostatic blood pressure measurements, should be performed. If symptoms are reproduced on examination, triggered dizziness is confirmed. Imaging as indicated in the relevant sections below. Spontaneous dizziness may be due to vestibular migraine, TIA, or Meniere's disease, among other causes. A detailed neurologic examination should be performed, and imaging as detailed below. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver should be performed or the individual should be referred to a clinician who could perform the procedure if Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) The Head Impulse Test (HIT) is also known as the Head thrust test. It is designed to evaluate the vestibular-ocular reflex in an individual with concern for a peripheral vestibulopathy due to ACUTE spontaneous vertigo. The individual is instructed to look at the examiner during the entire test. The individual's head is then quickly turned or rotated to one side and then the other. If normal, the individual's eyes should remain locked on the examiner. If abnormal, the eyes will move in the direction of the head rotation and then quickly correct. This saccade indicates peripheral vestibular hypofunction on the side of the direction that the head is turned. The HIT test is abnormal in individuals with vestibular neuronitis, and normal in individuals with a posterior circulation stroke. Posterior Canal BPPV (85-95% of BPPV cases) is defined as: oIndividual reports repeated episodes of vertigo with changes in head position relative to gravity. oEach of the following criteria is fulfilled on physical exam: Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCHead Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 Vertigo associated with torsional (rotatory), upbeating (toward the forehead) nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike test. There is a latency period between the completion of the Dix-Hallpike maneuver and the onset of vertigo and nystagmus. The provoked vertigo and nystagmus increase and then resolve within 60 seconds from the onset of the nystagmus. Lateral or Horizontal Canal BPPV (5-15% of BPPV cases) will have horizontal or no nystagmus to which a supine roll test assess for this condition. Exclusions for Dix-Hallpike maneuver oIndividual previously diagnosed with BPPV and who on date of encounter in calendar year does not have positional dizziness or vertigo consistent with active BPPV oIndividual has declined Dix-Hallpike maneuver oIndividual has cervical spinal disease (i.e., cervical stenosis, severe kyphoscoliosis, limited cervical range of motion, Down's syndrome, severe rheumatoid arthritis, cervical radiculopathies, Paget's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, low back dysfunction, spinal cord injuries, spinal fractures) oIndividual unable to lay flat (i.e., severe heart disease) oIndividual has severe atherosclerotic disease or recent dissection involving the anterior or posterior cerebral circulation oUnable to be seated in exam chair (i.e., morbidly obese), or maneuver cannot be safely performed given morbid obesity oEhlers Danlos/Marfans/Connective tissue disorder due to risk of cranio spinal instability/dissection Triggered episodic vestibular syndrome (t-EVS) usually last seconds to minutes with the most common triggers (vs. exacerbating factors) are head motion or change in body position. In the Emergency Department, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the second most common cause of t-EVS after orthostatic hypotension. Far lateral rotation of the neck leads to mechanical occlusion of one or both vertebral arteries causing temporary symptoms of vertigo and nystagmus when this position is maintained and may occur with the individual upright. Diagnoses or conditions associated with OH or nOH include: Parkinson Disease (PD), Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), Pure Autonomic Failure (PAF) or Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), unexplained fall or syncope, peripheral neuropathies secondary to diabetes, amyloidosis and HIV), individuals 70 years of age and frail and on multiple medications and individuals with postural (orthostatic) dizziness or nonspecific symptoms that occur when standing. Symptoms may include: lightheadedness or dizziness, the sensation of blacking out, cognitive dysfunction, mental dulling, generalized weakness, neck pain or discomfort in the suboccipital and paracervical region (coat hanger) or playpnea (dyspnea while standing). Secondary or advanced laboratory testing is considered for use in select individuals for paraneoplastic syndromes (paraneoplastic panel) and serum and urine protein Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

See Polyneuropathy (PN-3.1) in the Peripheral Nerve Disorders Imaging Guidelines, Multiple Myeloma and Plasmacytomas (ONC-25) in the Oncology Imaging Guidelines, and Paraneoplastic Syndromes in the Oncology Imaging Guidelines. Semicircular canal dehiscence (SCD) is a rare syndrome caused by dehiscence in the boney covering of the affected superior, posterior or lateral semicircular canal. When present, it can result in vestibular symptoms of vertigo associated with auditory symptoms including oscillopsia evoked by noise and conductive hearing loss. The vestibular symptoms in SCD can be debilitating. Individuals may note that loud noises cause them to see things moving or that they experience a similar sensation when they cough, sneeze, or strain to lift something heavy. The signs of vestibular abnormalities in SCD relate directly to the effect of the dehiscence which has created a third mobile window of the inner ear. Some individuals have a conductive hearing loss for low-frequency sounds that can resemble the pattern in otosclerosis. Occlusive carotid artery disease does not cause fainting but rather causes focal neurologic deficits such as unilateral weakness. Thus, carotid imaging will not identify the cause of the fainting and increases cost. Fainting is a frequent complaint, affecting 40% of people during their lifetime.

Common causes of ear pain include external and middle ear infections, dental problems, sinus infection, neck problems, tonsillitis, and pharyngitis. Advanced imaging is not indicated in the overwhelming majority of individuals with ear pain. CT Temporal Bone without contrast (CPT\u00ae 70480) or without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70482), OR, MRI Brain without and with contrast with attention to internal auditory canals (CPT\u00ae 70553), OR MRI Orbits/Face/Neck without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70543) is indicated for the following: oPersistent ear pain without obvious cause. oClinical suspicion for complicated or invasive infection such as mastoiditis. oClinical suspicion of mass lesion causing ear pain. oSignificant trauma with concern for hematoma formation. oPreoperative planning Cholesteatomas are expansive cysts of the middle ear filled with cellular debris. They can be congenital or arise from recurrent middle ear infections or trauma to the tympanic membrane. Hearing loss is usually conductive, although if the lesion is large enough combined conductive and sensorineural hearing loss may be present. Otoscopic exam findings and symptoms may include painless drainage from the ear or chronic/recurrent ear infections. oCT Temporal Bone without contrast (CPT\u00ae 70480) or without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70482), OR MRI Brain without and with contrast with attention to internal auditory canals (CPT\u00ae 70553), OR MRI Orbits/Face/Neck without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70543) is indicated for preoperative evaluation in cholesteatoma individuals. oCT Temporal Bone without contrast (CPT\u00ae 70480) or without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70482), OR MRI Brain without and with contrast with attention to internal auditory canals (CPT\u00ae 70553), OR MRI Orbits/Face/Neck without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70543) is indicated one time post-operatively to exclude residual or regrown cholesteatoma to avoid the need for a second-look surgery.

See General Guidelines (HD-1.0) CT Temporal Bone without (CPT\u00ae 70480) or MRI Brain without and with contrast (with IAC views) (CPT\u00ae 70553) or without contrast (CPT\u00ae 70551): oConductive hearing loss should have a CT Temporal Bone initially in the absence of an evident mass in the middle ear oMixed conductive (MC)/Sensorineural (SN) hearing loss or any sensorineural hearing loss (MRI generally preferred for SN - See Background and Supporting Information ) oUnilateral fluctuating or asymmetric hearing loss oCholesteatoma [See Mastoid or Ear Pain (HD-26.1) ] oCongenital hearing loss oSurgical planning, including cochlear implants (both CT Temporal Bone and MRI Brain for surgical planning if requested by surgeon or any provider in consultation with the surgeon) oHearing loss with vertigo [See oGlomus tumors or other vascular tumors of the middle ear, and/or surgical planning oAcquired sensorineural hearing loss if MRI unavailable or contraindicated Limited MRI Brain with attention to internal auditory canals (CPT\u00ae 70540, CPT\u00ae 70542, or CPT\u00ae 70543) when requested by the provider in place of a complete MRI Brain. Note: Limited MRI codes should not be used in addition to MRI Brain codes; IAC views are performed as additional sequences as part of the brain study. (See General Guidelines - Anatomic Issues (HD-1.1) ) Background and Supporting Information Sensorineural (SN) hearing loss - MRI is generally preferable to CT. CT Temporal bone is appropriate in post-traumatic SN hearing loss, to evaluate for bony remodeling of the IAC due to vestibular schwannoma and labyrinthine ossification resulting from prior infection and for consideration of otospongiosis, a common cause of MC and SN hearing loss.

The history in individuals with tinnitus should include a description of the tinnitus (episodic or constant, pulsatile or non-pulsatile, rhythmicity, pitch, quality of the sound), as well as inciting or alleviating factors. Continuous and pulsatile tinnitus are more concerning for an underlying and significant disorder. Audiometric assessment can be used as initial diagnostic testing particularly in individuals with tinnitus that is unilateral, persistent (>6 months) or associated with hearing difficulties.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Musculoskeletal Imaging Guidelines General Guidelines (MS-1) General Guidelines (MS- 1.0) Before advanced diagnostic imaging can be considered, there must be an in -person clinical evaluation as well as a clinical re -evaluation after a trial of failed conservative treatment ; the clinical re -evaluation may consist of an in -person evaluation or other meaningful contact with the provider's office such as email, web or telephone communications. An in-person clinical evaluation for the current episode of the condition is required to have been performed before advanced imaging can be considered. This may have been either the initial clinical evaluation or the clinical re -evaluation. The in-person clinical evaluation should include a relevant history and physical examination, appropriate laboratory studies, and non- advanced imaging modalities. Other forms of meaningful contact ( e.g., telephone call, electronic mail, telemedicine, or messaging) are not acceptable as an in -person evaluation. Prior to advanced imaging consideration, the results of plain x-rays performed after the current episode of symptoms started or changed need to be available to the requesting provider of the advanced imaging study for all musculoskeletal conditions, unless otherwise noted in the guidelines. Initial plain x -ray can rule out those situations that do not often require advanced imaging, such as osteoarthritis, acute/healing fracture, dislocation, osteomyelitis, acquired/congenital deformities, and tumors of bone amenable to biopsy or radiation therapy (in known metastatic disease), etc. X-ray may provide complementary clinical information regarding detailed bony anatomy , and may assist with preoperative planning when surgery is being contemplated. X-ray may provide clinically significant details for soft tissue masses, such as soft tissue calcification, presence or absence of phleboliths, radiographic density, and effect on adjacent bone. X-ray often has a larger field of view than MRI or CT and has the potential to identify more proximal or distal pathology in an extremity. Clinical re -evaluation is required prior to consideration of advanced diagnostic imaging to document failure of significant clinical improvement following a recent (within 3 months) six week trial of provider -directed conservative treatment. Clinical re-evaluation can include documentation of a in -person encounter or documentation of other meaningful contact with the requesting provider's office by the individual (e.g. telephone call, electronic mail, telemedicine, or messaging).

Orthopedic specialist evaluation can be helpful in determining the need for advanced imaging. The need for repeat advanced imaging should be carefully considered and may not be indicated if prior imaging has been perform ed. Serial advanced imaging, whether CT or MRI, for surveillance of healing or recovery from musculoskeletal disease is not supported by the medical evidence in the majority of musculoskeletal conditions.

CT may be the procedure of choice in individuals who cannot undergo an MRI, such as those with pacemakers. Bilateral Imaging Coding for bilateral imaging may vary from health care plan to health care plan. Not all coding options may be available for all health care plans. Positional MRI Positional MRI is also referred to as dynamic, standing, weight -bearing, or kinetic MRI. Currently, there is inadequate scientific evidence to support the medical necessity of this study. As such, it should be considered experimental or investigational. Positional CT Positional CT, also referred to as weight -bearing or cone beam CT, may be useful in imaging of the foot and ankle. If a request for foot or ankle imaging with positional CT meets medical necessity criteria for standard CT imaging ( as defined in the condition- specific guideline s), the request may be approved. Positional CT of anatomic areas other than the foot and ankle are considered experimental or investigational.

Currently, there is inadequate scientific evidence to support the medical necessity of this study. As such, it should be considered experimental or investigational for the diagnosis and surveillance of, or preoperative planning related to chondral pathology. Ultrasound (MS-2.3) Ultrasound (US) uses sound waves to produce images that can be used to evaluate a variety of musculoskelet al disorders . As with US in general, musculoskeletal US is highly operator -dependent, and proper training and experience are required to perform consistent, high quality evaluations. Contrast Issues (MS- 2.4) Most musculoskeletal imaging (MRI or CT) is without contrast ; however, the following examples may be considered with contrast : Tumors , osteomyelitis , and soft tissue infection (without and with contrast) MRI arthrography (with contrast only) MRI for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory arthritis (contrast as requested) For individuals with a contrast contraindication, if the advanced imaging recommendation specifically includes contrast, the corresponding advanced imaging study without contrast may be approved as an alternative, although the non-co ntrast study may not provide an adequate evaluation of the condition of concern. Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT) (MS- 2.5) PET/CT is a nuclear medicine/computed tomography (CT) fusion study that uses a positron emitting radiotracer to create cross -sectional and volumetric images based on tissue metabolism. PET imaging fusion with CT allows for better anatomic localization of the areas of abnormal increased tissue activity seen on PET. PET/CT is indicated for imaging of certain musculoskeletal conditions when MRI or CT is equivocal or cannot be performed. See: Nuclear Medicine (MS-28) for specific indications. At this time, FDG is the only indicated radiotracer for use with PET/CT in the imaging of musculoskeletal conditions.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Musculoskeletal Imaging Guidelines Nuclear Medicine (MS- 2.6) A bone scan is a nuclear medicine imaging study in which an amount of radioactive material is injected and images are obtained at different time intervals , depending on the condition. A bone scan is done to reveal problems with bone metabolism. Areas where bone cells are repairing themselves show the most activity. It can help diagnose a number of bone conditions, including cancer of the bone or metastasis, location of bone inflammation, fracture, and bone infection. Nuclear Medicine WBC Scan is performed using radioactive material which is tagged to the white blood cells . When injected into the body, the material attaches to sites of inflammation/infection. Once distributed in these areas, the sites of suspected infection/inflammation can be seen on nuclear imaging equipment. These can be imaged as a planar study, SPECT study, or SPECT/CT study. Bone Marrow Imaging is used in combination with a WBC Scan to help differentiate between true infection and physiological marrow uptake. The bone marrow scan provides a map of the normal physiological white cell uptake that is then compared to the white blood cell scan. Any discordance in white cell uptake (e.g., more WBC uptake than marrow uptake) between the two studies indicates a focus of infection.

A meaningful technological contact (telehealth visit, telephone call, electronic mail or messaging) since the onset or change in symptoms can serve as a pertinent clinical evaluation Advanced imaging of the neck covers the following areas: Skull bas e (thus a separate CPT\u00ae code for head imaging in order to visualize the skull base is not necessary). Nasopharynx Upper oral cavity to the head of the clavicle Parotid glands and the supraclavicular region Ultrasound of the soft tissues of the neck including thyroid, parathyroid, parotid and other salivary glands, lymph nodes, cysts, etc. is coded as CPT\u00ae 76536. This can be helpful in more ill -defined masses or fullness and differentiating adenopathy from mass or cyst, to define further advanced imaging. CT Neck CT Neck is usually obtained with contrast only (CPT\u00ae 70491). Little significant information is added by performing a CT Neck without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70492), and there is the risk of added radiation exposure, especially to the thyroid. CT Neck without contrast (CPT\u00ae 70490) can be difficult to interpret due to difficulty identifying the blood vessels Exception: Contrast is not generally used when evaluating the trachea with CT. Evaluate salivary duct stones in the appropriate clinical circumstance where intravenous contrast may obscure high attenuation stones Contrast enhanced CT is helpful in the assessment of cervical adenopathy and preoperative planning in the setting of thyroid carcinomas Contrast is recommended as an adjunct to US for individual s with clinical suspicion for advanced disease, including invasive primary tumor, or clinically apparent multiple or bulky lymph node involvement Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Use of IV contrast is an important adjunct because it helps to delineate the anatomic relationship between the primary tumor and metastatic disease. Iodine is generally cleared within four to eight weeks in most individual s, so concern about iodine burden from IV contrast causing a clinically significant delay in subsequent whole- body scans (WBSs) or radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment after the imaging followed by surgery is generally unfounded. The benefit gained from improved anatomic imaging generally outweighs any potential risk of a several week delay in RAI imaging or therapy. Where there is concern, a urinary iodine to creatinine ratio can be measured. MRI Neck MRI Neck is used less frequently than CT Neck. MRI Neck without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70543) is appropriate if CT suggests the need for further imaging or if ultrasound or CT suggests any of the following: Neurogenic tumor (schwannoma, tumor, etc.) Vascular masses Angiofibromas Concern for malignancy (See Squamous Cell Carcinomas of the Head and Neck (ONC -3), Gland Cancers (ONC -4), or T hyroid Cancer (ONC - 6) as appropriate) MRI Neck without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70543) is also directly supported if the head and neck specialist, or the provider in consultation with the head and neck specialist, has reasonable clinical concern: For a skull base or nasopharyngeal neoplasm, or potential perineural invas ion/cranial nerve involvement 2 That extensive dental amalgam may obscure the anatomy on CT in individuals with oral cavity neoplasm Reference Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

If there is improvement with conservative treatment, advanced imaging is not indicated if : 3,4,5 Inflammatory neck adenopathy is often associated with upper respiratory infection, pharyngitis, dental infection, HIV and toxoplasmosis. Occasionally it is associated with sarcoidosis and tuberculosis. Malignancy is a greater possibility in adults that are heavy drinkers and smokers, but HPV associated disease is on the rise and there can be a high suspicion for malignancy even without these traditional risk factors . ENT evaluation can be helpful in determining the need for advanced imaging . Although CT and MRI can have characteristic appearances for certain entities, biopsy and histological diagnosis are the only way to obtain a definitive diagnosis. The preferred initial method of biopsy is Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy of the mass . 5,6 The most common causes of neoplastic cervical adenopathy are metastasis from head and neck tumors or lymphoma.

Grading criteria are available at https://www.acr.org/ -/media/ACR/Files/RADS/TI Ultrasonography and MRI1,2.3.6.8 for thyroid nodule assessment. Thyroid nodule management relies on ultrasound characteristics, TSH level and FNA biopsy, together with clinical findings. A thyroid nodule is distinct either on palpation or radiologically (incidentaloma). Nonpalpable nodules have the same risk of cancer as palpable. Nodules >1 cm are evaluated, while smaller nodules are generally evaluated if there are suspicious sonographic features , co-existing adenopathy or a history of radiation or cancer exists. Ultrasound is not used to screen: 1) the general population, 2) individual s with normal thyroid on palpation with a low risk of thyroid cancer, 3) individual s with hyperthyroidism, 4) individuals with hypothyroidism or 5) individual s with thyroiditis. Conversely, US can be considered in individual s who have no symptoms but are high risk as a result of: history of head and neck irradiation, total body irradiation for bone marrow transplant, exposure to fallout from radiation during childhood or adolescence, as well as famil y history of thyroid cancer syndromes such as MEN2, or papillary thyroid familial adenomatous polyposis, Carney complex, Werner syndrome/progeria. There is insufficient evidence supporting the use of PET to distinguish i ndeterminate thyroid nodules that are benign from those that are malignant. 18FDG -PET imaging is not routinely recommended for the evaluation of thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology. Routine preoperative 18FDG -PET scanning is not recommended. Incidental focal FDG -PET uptake often corresponds to a clinically relevant thyroid nodule and ultrasound is recommended in individuals with a normal life expectancy. 1 Incidentally noted diffuse thyroid FDG -PET uptake most often corresponds to inflammatory uptake, however, ultrasound should be done to ensure that there is no evidence of clinically relevant nodularity. Elastography provides information about nodule stiffness that is complementary to gray scale ultrasound findings in nodules with indeterminate cytology or ultrasound findings. It should not be used as a substitute for gray scale ultrasound. Use of ultrasound contrast medium is not recommended for the diagnostic evaluation of thyroid nodules and its current use is restricted to definition of size and limits of necrotic zones after minimally invasive nodule ablation techniques .

It is unclear what percentage of non- functioning PTIs become hyper -secreting over time, but many of these masses are surgically managed. 2,3,4,6 Norm ally sized and normally functioning parathyroid glands do not take up sestamibi or tetrofosmin.7 The likelihood of a positive parathyroid nuclear scan is low in the setting of normal calcium and PTH levels.5,6 Parathyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy has been used historically however its diagnostic use is limited, due to the potential for hemorrhage and fibrosis which make eventual surgical dissection and pathologic interpretation more difficult. 1,4 References Thyroid 1.

Dual -phase CT imaging (without and with IV contrast) is not supported. CT performed only without IV contrast may be helpful in a small minority of cases including cases of follow -up for known salivary stones . A recent study in the American Journal of Neuroradiology comparing contrast enhanced and non- contrast enhanced CT in the evaluation of sialolithiasis demonstrated excellent sensitivity and specificity with no false- positive results using contrast -enhanced CT alone. Benefits of initial contrast -enhanced CT include better evaluation of the ductal system, improved soft tissue contrast in assessing salivary masses and decreased radiation dose (compared to dual phase CT imaging (without and with IV contrast)). 3 References Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

It is not appropriate to report non-obstetrical, pelvic ultrasound procedure codes (CPT\u00ae 76830, CPT\u00ae 76856, and CPT\u00ae 76857) with a positive pregnancy test or a confirmed pregnancy An evaluation of pregnancy with a history and physical exam (an initial office visit) is necessary prior to obstetric ultrasound imaging requests oThe following information must be submitted with each request: Expected date of delivery Gestational age at date of service Results of prior ultrasound studies if available Ultrasound assessment is an accurate method of determining gestational age, fetal number, viability, and placental location, and it is recommended for all pregnant patients oThough fetal anatomy survey (CPT\u00ae 76805/CPT\u00ae 76811 if high-risk) can be performed as early as 14 weeks gestation, per ACOG, in the absence of other specific indications, the optimal time for a single ultrasound examination is at 18 to 22 weeks of gestation. This timing allows for a survey of fetal anatomy in most women and an accurate estimation of gestational age.2 For a Normal (Low Risk) Pregnancy report a fetal anatomy ultrasound CPT\u00ae 76805 if 16 weeks If pregnancy is High Risk can report: A detailed for each additional fetus)] between 12 weeks 0 days and 13 weeks 6 days (if indicated), See Detailed First Trimester Fetal Anatomic Scan (OB- 9.12), and A detailed fetal anatomy ultrasound (CPT\u00ae 76811) if 16 weeks These high risk scans are indication driven and are generally performed by a Maternal Fetal Medicine (MFM) specialist/Perinatologist, or a Radiologist at an AIUM or ACR facility.

These codes should only be used once per pregnancy unless the mother changes to a new medical caregiver at a new office and there is a new medical indication for ultrasound. CPT\u00ae 76813 and CPT\u00ae 76814 (each additional fetus) are used to report nuchal translucency screening: an ultrasound measurement of the clear (translucent) space at the back of the fetal neck to assess risk for Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21), Trisomy 18, and other genetic disorders. (and CPT\u00ae 76802 plus CPT\u00ae 76814 for each additional fetus) when billed together, are used to report a detailed first-trimester obstetric ultrasound examination between 12 weeks 0 days and 13 weeks 6 days.3,15 This indication-driven detailed first trimester fetal anatomic evaluation is generally performed by those with special skills to perform this study, such as a Maternal Fetal Medicine specialist (Perinatologist), or a Radiologist with advanced training in fetal imaging. These codes should only be used once per pregnancy unless the mother changes to a new medical caregiver at a new office and there is a new medical indication for ultrasound. See Detailed First Trimester Fetal Anatomic Scan (OB-9.12) CPT\u00ae 76805 and CPT\u00ae 76810 (for each additional fetus) are used to report complete studies (anatomy scan) performed during the second and third trimester, in a normal (low risk) pregnancy. These studies should only be used once per pregnancy unless the mother changes to a new medical caregiver at a new office and there is a new medical indication for ultrasound. CPT\u00ae 76811 and CPT\u00ae 76812 (for each additional fetus) describe a detailed fetal anatomic survey and are used only when the study includes this service. These studies should only be used once per pregnancy unless the mother changes to a new medical caregiver at a new office and there is a new medical indication for ultrasound. This detailed fetal anatomic evaluation is generally performed by those with special skills to perform this study, such as a Maternal Fetal Medicine specialist (Perinatologist), or a Radiologist with advanced training in fetal imaging.

CPT\u00ae 76817 is used to report a transvaginal ultrasound. The other OB ultrasound codes are used for transabdominal studies. CPT\u00ae 76816 is used to report a follow up study, such as a growth scan or follow up on anatomy when more than one area requires reexamination. CPT\u00ae 76816 [should not be performed prior to a CPT\u00ae 76801 or an anatomy scan CPT\u00ae 76805 (normal pregnancy) or Detailed anatomy scan CPT\u00ae 76811 (high risk pregnancy)] CPT\u00ae 76816 should not be done on same date of service as CPT\u00ae 76815 CPT\u00ae 76815 describes a limited or 'quick look' study It can be used at any gestational age for various indications, including quick look for AFI assessment, fetal heart-beat, fetal position, placental location etc. It can be used specifically for 'dating' (when indicated) in those that don't meet gestational age criteria for dating with CPT\u00ae 76801 or are too early for anatomy scan (i.e. >14 weeks but <16 weeks) It is also used to report a modified BPP. Note: CPT\u00ae 76815 should never used to report a Biophysical profile (BPP), a test for antepartum fetal surveillance (A BPP is not typically performed before 26 weeks due to lack of fetal brain stem maturity prior to this gestational age). CPT\u00ae 76820 describes Doppler velocimetry of the umbilical artery. CPT\u00ae Doppler velocimetry of the middle cerebral 76825 describes fetal echocardiography and and CPT\u00ae 76827 describes the Doppler portion of the echocardiogram. These codes should only be used once per pregnancy unless the mother changes to a new medical caregiver at a new office or there is a new medical indication for ultrasound. CPT\u00ae 76826 describes a follow up fetal echocardiography and CPT\u00ae 76828 describes a follow up Doppler portion of the echocardiogram. CPT\u00ae 93325 can be added for color mapping in conjunction with fetal echocardiography procedures. CPT\u00ae 93976 describes a limited duplex scan and is used during pregnancy for characterizing the pattern and direction of blood flow in arteries and veins. It can be used to report fetal umbilical-placental flow evaluation (accreta or other placental or Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

CPT\u00ae 74712 and CPT\u00ae 74713 (for each additional fetus) are used to report a fetal MRI (indicated for more in depth imaging of certain fetal abnormalities). Background and Supporting Information ACOG recommendations for imaging during pregnancy and lactation: oUltrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are not associated with risk and are the imaging techniques of choice for the pregnant patient, but they should be used prudently and only when use is expected to answer a relevant clinical question or otherwise provide medical benefit to the patient. oWith few exceptions, radiation exposure through radiography (Xrays), computed tomography (CT) scan, or nuclear medicine imaging techniques is at a dose much lower than the exposure associated with fetal harm. If these techniques are necessary in addition to ultrasound or MRI or are more readily available for the diagnosis in question, they should not be withheld from a pregnant patient. oThe use of gadolinium contrast with MRI should be limited; it should be used as a contrast agent in a pregnant woman only if it significantly improves diagnostic performance and is expected to improve fetal or maternal outcome. oWith regards to iodinated IV contrast media, \"it is generally recommended that contrast only be used if absolutely required to obtain additional diagnostic information that will affect the care of the fetus or woman during pregnancy\". In circumstances where the individual is deemed to have an increased risk for a fetal abnormality and does not have access to a provider who can perform the more desirable fetal and maternal ultrasound with detailed fetal anatomic examination (CPT\u00ae 76811) due to geographic or other constraints, a standard (after first trimester) fetal and maternal ultrasound (CPT\u00ae 76805) can be authorized instead. CPT\u00ae 76816 [should not be performed prior to a CPT\u00ae 76801 or an anatomy scan CPT\u00ae 76805 (normal pregnancy) or Detailed anatomy scan CPT\u00ae 76811 (high risk pregnancy)], and is typically not performed prior to 14 weeks gestation. Typically all components of the BPP (CPT\u00ae 76818 and CPT\u00ae 76819), such as breathing, are not present until 26 weeks gestation. However, a modified BPP (CPT\u00ae 76815) can be utilized sooner in certain high risk cases but should not be done prior to viability (23 weeks). SMFM suggest that ductus venosus, middle cerebral artery, or uterine artery Doppler use for routine clinical management of early- or late-onset FGR is not recommended The minimal use of color Doppler alone (CPT\u00ae 93976), when performed for anatomical structure identification, during a standard ultrasound procedure, is not separately reimbursable.

Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) can be done at 15 to 20 weeks to screen for neural tube defects in those that have had cfDNA or NT screen. The \"quad\" the most commonly used test for the second trimester. A penta screen (quad screen markers + hyperglycosylated hCG) may be done in lieu of a quad screen. Combined, integrated or sequential screening (first and second trimester screening) may also be used and provides a higher detection rate than a single screening.

The detailed first trimester ultrasound and the detailed fetal anatomic evaluation are indication driven and generally performed by those with special skills to perform this study, such as a Maternal Fetal Medicine specialist (Perinatologist), or a Radiologist with advanced training in fetal imaging. See Detailed First Trimester Fetal Anatomic Scan (OB-9.12) In circumstances where the individual is deemed to have an increased risk for a fetal abnormality and does not have access to a provider who can perform the more desirable fetal and maternal ultrasound with detailed fetal anatomic examination (CPT\u00ae 76811) due to geographic or other constraints, a standard (after first trimester) fetal and maternal ultrasound (CPT\u00ae 76805) can be and CPT\u00ae 76812 should only be used once per pregnancy unless the mother changes to a new medical caregiver at a new office and there is a new medical indication and/or change in condition. Current ACOG and SMFM guidelines state that CL screening in singleton gestations without a prior spontaneous PTB cannot yet be universally mandated oTransvaginal ultrasound (CPT\u00ae 76817) can be performed if the transabdominal cervical length (CL) is 3.6 cm. If documented transabdominal attempt fails to visualize cervix, then CPT\u00ae 76817 may be performed on a case by case basis. See Cervical Length Screening (OB-7.3) . If cervical shortening is identified - See Cervical Insufficiency (OB-18.1) CPT\u00ae 76816 (should not be performed prior to a CPT\u00ae 76801 or an anatomy scan CPT\u00ae 76805 (normal pregnancy) or Detailed anatomy scan CPT\u00ae 76811 (high risk pregnancy) Typically all components of the BPP (CPT\u00ae 76818 and CPT\u00ae 76819), such as breathing, are not present until 26 weeks gestation. However, a modified BPP (CPT\u00ae 76815) can be utilized sooner in certain high risk cases but should not be done prior to viability (23 weeks). CPT\u00ae 76815 should never be reported with middle cerebral artery, or uterine artery Doppler use for routine clinical management of early- or late-onset FGR is not recommended Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Background and Supporting Information The sensitivity of cfDNA screening may not be as accurate in twins and higher order multiples. First trimester screening in twins has a similar detection rate to singleton gestation Birth weight discordance = (larger twin weight minus smaller twin weight) divided larger twin weight \u00d7 100. Universal CL screening with transvaginal ultrasound (CPT\u00ae 76817) is NOT recommended in twin gestations. In addition, Per ACOG - Cerclage placement (prophylactic or rescue) should be avoided in multifetal pregnancies. However, because several studies have shown that a one-time CL measurement 20 mm at 18-24 weeks may be an accurate predictor of preterm birth in multiple gestation, and because progesterone therapy might reduce the risk of neonatal morbidity and mortality associated with PTB, then a one-time transvaginal CL assessment can be performed if trans-abdominal CL measures 3.6 cm (as with singleton gestation- See Cervical Length Screening (OB-7.3) . TTTS is diagnosed by the ultrasound findings of polyhydramnios in one twin (the recipient) and oligohydramnios in the other twin (the donor). If AFI is discordant between the twins (low but not <2 cm in one and/or high but not >8 cm in the other); weekly imaging (MCA and/or limited US) can be performed to rule-out developing TTTS.

Monochorionic twin pregnancies with demise of one twin after 17 weeks have up to an 18% chance of major morbidity or mortality for the remaining fetus.

These complications relate to preterm labor, placental abruption, fetal growth restriction, and fetal compression syndromes. The risk of preterm labor Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCObstetrical Ultrasound (OB US) Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 appears to correlate with the size of the fibroid (over 600 cm3) and/or the presence of multiple fibroids. Placental abruption has been reported to occur frequently in pregnancies complicated by fibroids, especially with placentation over a fibroid. Fibroid volumes >200 cm3 are more commonly associated with fetal growth restriction. Fetal compression syndrome is a direct result of large fibroids and is not commonly found with small fibroids. Finally, malposition or obstructed labor may be associated with fibroids of the lower uterine segment. Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Background and Supporting Information Fetal anemia and hydrops may be a result of immune conditions, such as red-cell or Kell alloimmunization, non-immune hydrops caused by parvovirus B19 infection or any other known acquired or congenital causes of fetal anemia. Rhesus isoimmunization/alloimmunization is the process through which fetal Rh+ red blood cells enter the circulation of an Rh negative mother causing her to produce antibodies which can cross the placenta and destroy the red blood cells of the current Rh+ fetus and/or in subsequent Rh+ pregnancies. Atypical antigens not listed above, may be associated with hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn and may require fetal assessment as in Alloimmunization/Rh Isoimmunization (OB-16.1) MNSs series (M, N, s, U, Mi), MSSs-Mta, Diego (Dia, Dib), P- PPTj, Public LW. Peak systolic velocity (PSV) of the fetal middle cerebral artery can be used as a substitute for amniocentesis to evaluate a fetus at risk for anemia due to Rhesus isoimmunization/alloimmunization. Measurements can be initiated as early as 16 weeks of gestation if there is a past history of early severe fetal anemia or very high titers. Because MCA-PSV increases across gestation, results are adjusted for gestational age. In circumstances where the individual is deemed to have an increased risk for a fetal abnormality and does not have access to a provider who can perform the more desirable fetal and maternal ultrasound with detailed fetal anatomic examination (CPT\u00ae 76811) due to geographic or other constraints, a standard (after first trimester) fetal and maternal ultrasound (CPT\u00ae 76805) can be authorized instead.

Those with REDV are usually hospitalized for closer surveillance and delivery planning. Fetuses with early onset FGR are at significant risk for IUFD and the rate of fetal growth prior to 23 weeks and UA Doppler findings may aid in counseling patients in this peri-viability period (TOP versus attempt at prolonging pregnancy till viability) - as such in rare circumstances fetal growth (CPT\u00ae 76816) and UA Doppler (CPT\u00ae 76820) may be considered prior to 23 weeks gestation. In circumstances where CPT\u00ae 76811 cannot be performed See Ultrasound Code Selection (OB-1.3) Typically all components of the BPP (CPT\u00ae 76818 and CPT\u00ae 76819), such as breathing, are not present until 26 weeks gestation. However, a modified BPP (CPT\u00ae 76815) can be utilized sooner in certain high risk cases but should not be done prior to viability (23 weeks). CPT\u00ae 76815 should never be reported with survey (CPT\u00ae 76805/CPT\u00ae 76811) can be performed as early as 14 weeks gestation, per ACOG, in the absence of other specific indications, it is optimally performed at 18 to 22 weeks of gestation.

MRI Pelvis without contrast (CPT\u00ae 72195) is the appropriate code if only placenta or maternal pelvis is imaged without fetal imaging The uterus, tubes and ovaries arise out of the pelvis and are considered pelvic organs. If the uterus rises out of the pelvic cavity, the imaging field can be determined on scout films. Imaging of the abdomen is not supported for problems suspected to arise from the pelvis. The scout images (CT) and localizer images (MRI) are used to define the imaging field that is relevant to anatomical structures of clinical interest. The imaging field is defined by this clinical question, not by the imaging procedure code. The imaging code indicates the general anatomical region but does not define the specific imaging protocol or sequences.

Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCObstetrical Ultrasound (OB US) Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 oUltrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are not associated with risk and are the imaging techniques of choice for the pregnant patient, but they should be used prudently and only when use is expected to answer a relevant clinical question or otherwise provide medical benefit to the patient. oWith few exceptions, radiation exposure through radiography (Xrays), computed tomography (CT) scan, or nuclear medicine imaging techniques is at a dose much lower than the exposure associated with fetal harm. If these techniques are necessary in addition to ultrasound or MRI or are more readily available for the diagnosis in question, they should not be withheld from a pregnant patient. oThe use of gadolinium contrast with MRI should be limited; it should be used as a contrast agent in a pregnant woman only if it significantly improves diagnostic performance and is expected to improve fetal or maternal outcome. oWith regards to iodinated IV contrast media, \"it is generally recommended that contrast only be used if absolutely required to obtain additional diagnostic information that will affect the care of the fetus or woman during pregnancy\".

The following parameters are evaluated: oFetal breathing movements oGross fetal body movements oFetal tone oAmniotic fluid volume, at least one vertical pocket 2 x 2 cm oReactive FHR (non-stress testing portion) CPT\u00ae 76815 is used to assess the AFI portion of a modified BPP (NST + AFI) Typically all components of the BPP (CPT\u00ae76818 and CPT\u00ae76819), such as breathing, are not present until 26 weeks gestation. However, a modified BPP (CPT\u00ae76815) can be utilized sooner in certain high risk cases but should not be done prior to viability (23 weeks). If BPP 6, repeat BPP in 24 hours Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

The clinical evaluation may include a relevant history and physical examination, including biopsy, appropriate laboratory studies, and results of non-advanced or advanced imaging modalities. Unless otherwise stated in the disease-specific guideline, a histological confirmation of malignancy (or recurrence) and the stage of disease is required to perform a medical necessity review of the requested imaging. Generally, the studies listed in the disease-specific sections reflect the studies supported by current literature and research for that condition. If a study is not listed, then it is not supported. Routine imaging of brain, spine, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, bones, or other body areas is not indicated except where explicitly stated in a diagnosis-specific guideline section, or if one of the following applies: oKnown prior disease involving the requested body area oNew or worsening symptoms or physical exam findings involving the requested body area (including non-specific findings such as ascites or pleural effusion) oNew finding on basic imaging study such as plain x-ray or ultrasound oNew finding on adjacent body area CT/MRI study (i.e., pleural effusion observed on CT abdomen) Unless otherwise stated in the disease-specific guideline, advanced imaging of asymptomatic individuals is not routinely supported without signs or symptoms of systemic involvement of cancer. Repeat imaging studies are not generally necessary unless there is evidence of disease progression, recurrence of disease, and/or the repeat imaging will affect an individual's clinical management. Conventional imaging performed prior to diagnosis should not be repeated unless there is a delay of at least 6 weeks since previous imaging and treatment initiation or there are new or significantly worsening clinical signs or symptoms Phase Imaging Timeframe After definitive local therapy of primary tumor (surgery or radiation therapy)Follow surveillance guidelines During adjuvant chemotherapy Follow surveillance guidelines After ablative therapy See disease-specific guidelines During chemotherapy or immunotherapy for measurable diseaseEvery 2 cycles (generally every 6 to 8 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

MUGA Scan may be performed instead of ECHO in individuals who have a low LV ejection fraction of <50% on a prior ECHO or MUGA, pre-existing left ventricular wall motion abnormalities from ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathies, congestive heart failure or when ECHO is technically limited and prevents accurate assessment of LV function. A prior MUGA is not a reason to approve another MUGA (it is not necessary to compare LVEF by the same modality) oThe timeframe for monitoring the ejection fraction should be determined by the provider, but no more often than baseline and at every 6 weeks. oMay repeat every 4 weeks if cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic drug is withheld for significant left ventricular cardiac dysfunction. oSee: Oncologic Indications for Cancer Therapeutics-Related Cardiac Dysfunction (CTRCD) (CD-12.1) in the Cardiology Imaging Guidelines CTA or MRA of a specific anatomic region is indicated when requested for surgical planning when there is suspected vascular proximity to proposed resection margin. Adults (18 years) with a diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) may be screened for malignancy with a Whole Body MRI (CPT\u00ae 76498) on an annual basis. Annual Brain MRI (CPT\u00ae 70553) may be performed as part of Whole Body MRI or as a separate exam. Due to lack of standardization of technique, interpretation, and availability of Whole Body MRI, individuals with LFS are encouraged to participate in clinical trials. Use of Contrast CT imaging should be performed with contrast for known or suspected body regions, unless contraindicated. oShellfish allergy is not a contraindication to contrast. Individuals with known shellfish allergy do not have contrast reaction any more often than other atopic individuals or individuals with other food allergies. oFor iodinated contrast dye allergy, either CT scans without contrast or MRI scans without and with contrast are indicated. oIf CT scanning is considered strongly indicated in a individual with known contrast allergy, CT with contrast may be considered to be safely performed following prednisone premedication over a 24-hour period prior to the study. For individuals with renal insufficiency which precludes contrast use, CT without contrast appropriate disease-specific areas should be offered. Further imaging (such as MRI) may be indicated if noncontrast CT results are inconclusive. Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCOncology Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 Severe renal insufficiency, i.e. an eGFR less than 30, is a contraindication for an MRI using a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) as well. In individuals with eGFR greater than 40, GBCA administration can be safely performed. GBCA administered to individuals with acute kidney injury or severe chronic kidney disease can result in a syndrome of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), but GBCAs are not considered nephrotoxic at dosages approved for MRI. Gadolinium deposition has been found in individuals with normal renal function following the use of gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCAs). oThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is investigating the risk of brain deposits following repeated use of GBCAs. oThe FDA has noted that, \"It is unknown whether these gadolinium deposits are harmful or can lead to adverse health effects.\" and have recommended: To reduce the potential for gadolinium accumulation, health care professionals should consider limiting GBCA use to clinical circumstances in which the additional information provided by the contrast is necessary. Health care professionals are also urged to reassess the necessity of repetitive GBCA MRIs in established treatment protocols. Radiation Exposure The use of MRI in place of CT scans to reduce risk of secondary malignancy from radiation exposure during CT is not supported by the peer-reviewed literature. Unless otherwise specified in the Guidelines, MRI in place of CT scans for this purpose alone is not indicated. In some instances (i.e., testicular cancer surveillance), MRI may be considered inferior to CT scans. Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Merkel cell carcinoma may present as a primary cancer or as a skin metastasis from a noncutaneous primary neuroendocrine carcinoma (i.e., small cell lung cancer), therefore conventional imaging is indicated initially to confirm the absence of metastasis prior to considering PET scan.

Whole Body Thyroid Nuclear scan (also known as whole-body radioiodine scan) is coded with CPT\u00ae 78018. If CPT\u00ae 78018 is obtained and found to be positive, CPT\u00ae 78020 may be approved as an add-on test to evaluate the degree of iodine uptake. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging CPT\u00ae 78832) may complement planar and pinhole imaging and can be approved as an add-on wherever radioiodine (RAI) scans are indicated. Whole Body Thyroid Nuclear scan (also known as whole-body RAI scan) is the imaging modality of choice for differentiated thyroid cancers, as these are usually not well visualized on FDG-PET/CT scans. Individuals who have RAI-diagnostic scan negative and PET-positive disease will generally not respond to RAI treatment; whereas individuals who have PET-negative and RAI-diagnostic scan negative disease may still be candidates for empiric RAI treatment. Radioiodine (RAI) refractory disease is defined as: (i) the malignant/metastatic tissue does not ever concentrate RAI (no uptake outside the thyroid bed at the first therapeutic WBS), (ii)the tumor tissue loses the ability to concentrate RAI after previous evidence of RAI-avid disease (in the absence of stable iodine contamination), (iii) RAI is concentrated in some lesions but not in others; and (iv) metastatic disease progresses despite significant concentration of RAI6 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Use this guideline for imaging recommendations for small and large cell high-grade (poorly differentiated) neuroendocrine tumors of the lung.

Plain x-ray appearance is diagnostic for many benign bone tumors and advanced imaging is generally unnecessary except for preoperative planning. MRI without and with contrast is the primary modality for advanced imaging of bone tumors, and can be approved to help narrow differential diagnoses and determine whether biopsy is indicated. Some benign bone tumor types carry a risk of malignant degeneration over time, but routine advanced imaging surveillance has not been shown to improve outcomes for these individuals. MRI without and with contrast can be approved to evaluate new findings on Plain x- ray new/worsening clinical symptoms not explained by a recent Plain x-ray. There are no data to support the use of PET/CT in the evaluation of benign bone tumors, and PET requests should not be approved without biopsy confirmation of a malignancy. Other benign bone tumors should be imaged according to guidelines in Lesion of Bone (MS-10.1) in the General Musculoskeletal Imaging Guidelines or Mass Involving Bone (including Lytic and Blastic Metastatic Disease) (PEDMS-3.4) in the Pediatric Musculoskeletal Imaging Guidelines.

See table below for age- and risk- specific screening recommendations New onset of diabetes in individuals older than 50 has been recognized as a potential indicator of the development of pancreatic cancer. Approximately 1% of individuals in this category are diagnosed with cancer within 3 years. A prediction model has been established which identifies those individuals at greatest risk for pancreatic malignancy. The scoring system, known as ENDPAC (Enriching New- Onset Diabetes for Pancreatic Cancer) is based on 3 discriminatory factors, including change in blood glucose, change in weight, and age of onset at the time of the new diagnosis of diabetes. A score of >3 imparts an elevated risk of pancreatic cancer (3.6%), and these individuals should be screened. Screening is not indicated at this time for scores of 0-2.

A dedicated triple-phase CT or MRI may be obtained. MRI with contrast is the test of choice for the evaluation of liver masses. It offers soft tissue contrast resolution superior to CT as well as the possibility of using two different contrast agents, one of which if more blood flow based and the other which also is blood flow based and demonstrates hepatobiliary function (Eovist). Classical imaging findings include: phase washout appearance oCapsule appearance oThreshold growth For individuals who are high risk for developing HCC (cirrhosis, chronic Hepatitis B or current or prior HCC), if the liver lesion is >1 cm with 2 classic enhancements on triple-phase CT or MRI, the diagnosis is confirmatory and biopsy is not needed. For lesions less than 1 cm or with less than 2 classical enhancements or for any liver lesions in individuals who are not high risk, a biopsy is needed for histological confirmation.

However, individuals at high risk may begin screening at age 40. High risk features include: oAfrican ancestry oGermline mutations (BRCA1 or 2, HOXB13, mismatch repair genes - MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) that increase the risk of prostate cancer oFamily history of first or second-degree relative with prostate, male breast, colorectal, pancreatic, endometrial or female breast cancer at age <45 years. Treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia with 5-alfa reductase inhibitors (such as finasteride and dutasteride) can falsely reduce the measured PSA levels by 50%. Thus, the reported PSA level should be doubled when prostate cancer is suspected in individuals on these medications. Individuals with high-risk adverse clinical and pathological factors may benefit from a more aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approach at the time of relapse after initial treatment. These factors include pre-treatment Gleason score of 8, pre- treatment clinical stage of cT3b or higher, positive surgical margins, post-treatment PSA doubling time of <3 months, and an interval to biochemical failure of <3 years after initial treatment. PET/CT scan using 18F-FDG radiotracer are considered investigational and experimental for evaluation of prostate cancer. 11C Choline, 18F-Fluciclovine (AXUMIN\u00ae), and PSMA-specific radiopharmaceuticals have recently gained FDA approval for evaluation of prostate cancer. Optimal detection rates for these radiotracers vary greatly with PSA levels. False positive rate is high and histological confirmation of positive sites is recommended. Coverage may vary with individual health care plan. PSMA-specific PET radiopharmaceuticals that are currently FDA-approved and indicated in prostate cancer are: 68Ga and Locametz\u00ae). While early detection of low-volume recurrence after treatment of prostate cancer using PET/CT scans may influence therapeutic decisions, there is lack of evidence that this approach has any meaningful impact on overall survival. As high intensity focused ultrasound prostate ablation is considered investigational and experimental at this time, and advanced imaging for treatment planning and/or surveillance of high intensity focused ultrasound prostate ablation is not indicated. MR Spectroscopy (CPT\u00ae 76390) is considered investigational and experimental in the evaluation of prostate cancer at this time. Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCOncology Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 As laser prostate ablation is considered investigational and experimental at this time, advanced imaging for treatment planning and/or surveillance of laser prostate ablation is not indicated. Monitoring an elevated prostate-specific antigen level (PSA) with serial MRI is not indicated for suspected prostate cancer. Requests for imaging based on PSA must provide a recent (within the last 60 days) PSA.

While being treated with active surveillance, an individual is generally considered a potential candidate for curative intent treatment approaches in the event that disease progression occurs. It is important to distinguish active surveillance from watchful waiting (or observation), which is generally employed in individuals with limited life expectancy. Watchful waiting involves cessation of routine monitoring and treatment is initiated only if symptoms develop. Current active surveillance guidelines suggest the following protocol: PSA every 6 months Digital Rectal Exam (DRE) every 12 months Repeat prostate biopsy every 12 months Repeat mpMRI (CPT\u00ae 72195 or CPT\u00ae 72197) no more often than every 12 months Indication Imaging Study Routine monitoring on active surveillance protocolMRI Pelvis without (CPT\u00ae 72195) or without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 72197) at initiation of active surveillance, and every 12 months thereafter For ANY of the following : Progression is suspected based on DRE changes or rising PSA and a recent TRUS biopsy was negative Repeat TRUS biopsy shows Gleason scoreMRI Pelvis without (CPT\u00ae 72195) or MRI Pelvis contrast (CPT\u00ae 72197) Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Individuals age 15 years at diagnosis should be imaged according to pediatric guidelines in: Pediatric Germ Cell Tumors (PEDONC-10) in the Pediatric Oncology Imaging Guidelines. These guidelines are for germ cell tumors of the testicle, ovary and extragonadal sites as well as malignant sex cord stromal tumors (granulosa cell and Sertoli- Leydig cell tumors). Requests for imaging must state the histologic type of the cancer being evaluated. Classified as pure seminomas (dysgerminomas, 40%) or Non-seminomatous germ cell defined as pure seminoma histology a normal serum concentration of alpha fetoprotein (AFP). Seminomas with elevated AFP are by definition Mixed. oRequired for TNM staging are the tumor marker levels indicated by \"S\" (TNMS) oMixed tumors are treated as NSGCTs, as they to be more aggressive. oThe to 20%) Endodermal Sinus Tumors (ovarian) Combinations of all of the above (Mixed) MRI in place of CT scans to reduce risk of secondary malignancy is not supported by the peer-reviewed literature. CT scans are indicated for surveillance and are the preferred modality of imaging to assess for recurrence.

This is most commonly used in diseases originating in the hematopoietic system, such as leukemias and lymphomas, and bone marrow failure syndromes or metabolic disorders. Common types are: Matched sibling donor (MSD or MRD): Donor and recipient are full siblings and HLA-matched Matched unrelated donor (MUD): Donor and recipient are HLA matched but not related to each other Cord blood: Donor stem cells come from frozen umbilical cord blood not related to the recipient, sometimes from multiple different donors at once Haploidentical transplant (haplo): Donor is a half-HLA match to the recipient, usually a parent Autologous (\"auto\"): The donor and recipient are the same person. The process involves delivery of high dose chemotherapy that is ablative to the bone marrow, followed by an infusion of one's own harvested stem cells. Allogeneic HSCT results in a much greater degree of immunosuppression than autologous HSCT because of the need to allow the new immune system to chimerize with the recipient's body. Immune reconstitution commonly takes more than a year for individuals who receive allogeneic HSCT, and individuals remain at high risk for invasive infections until that has occurred. Pre-Transplant Imaging in HSCT: Pre-transplant imaging in HSCT generally takes place within 30 days prior to transplant and involves a reassessment of the individual's disease status as well as infectious disease clearance. Indication Imaging Immediate pre-transplant period Chest x-ray CT Chest with contrast (CPT\u00ae 71260) or CT Chest without contrast (CPT\u00ae 71250) for new findings on chest x-ray, or new/worsening signs/symptoms Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCPelvis Imaging Guidelines General Guidelines (PV-1.0) A current clinical evaluation since the onset or change in symptoms is required before advanced imaging can be considered. The clinical evaluation should include a relevant history and physical examination including a gynecological and/or urological exam , appropriate laboratory studies, and non- advanced imaging modalities such as plain x -ray or Pelvic ultrasound . meaningful contact (telehealth visit, telephone call, electronic mail ormessaging) since the onset or change in symptoms for follow up visit by an established individual can substitute for a face- to-face clinical evaluation. The use of gynecology CPT codes for pregnant women is not supported. Therefore, transvaginal ultrasound (CPT \u00ae 76830) and pelvic ultrasound (CPT\u00ae 76856 or CPT\u00ae 76857) are not supported for those with a positive pregnancy test or knownpregnancy. If a pregnancy test is positive, then obstetrical CPT codes a re indicated. The uterus, tubes and ovaries arise out of the pelvis and are considered pelvicorgans. If the uterus rises out of the pelvic cavity, the imaging field can bedetermined on scout films. Imaging of the abdomen is not routinely supported forproblems suspected to arise from the pelvis unless specifically described in other areas of the guidelines. The scout images (CT) and localizer images (MRI) are used to define the imagingfield that is relevant to anatomical structures of clinical interest. The imaging field isdefined by this clinical question, not by the imaging procedure code. The imagingcode indicates the general anatomical region but does not define the specificimaging protocol or sequences. General Guidelines - Overview (PV-1.1) When indicated, pregnant women should be evaluated with ultrasound or MRI without contrast to avoid radiation exposure. In carefully selected clinicalcircumstances, evaluation with CT may be considered with careful attention totechnique and radiation protection as deemed clinically appropriate. Ultrasound Transvaginal ultrasound is the recommended modality for imaging; no alternativemodality has demonstrated sufficient superiority to justify routine use, andTransvaginal (TV) ultrasound (CPT \u00ae 76830) is the optimal study to evaluate adult female pelvic pathology. Pelvic ultrasound (complete CPT\u00ae 76856, or limited CPT\u00ae 76857) can be performed if it is a complementary study to the TV ultrasound. It may substitute for TV inpediatric individuals or non- sexually active females .

Pelvic ultrasound (CPT\u00ae 76856 or CPT\u00ae 76857) can be performed if requested as a complimentary study to the TV ultrasound. Once confirmed, Color Doppler ultrasonography (CPT\u00ae 93975 or CPT\u00ae 93976) may be useful evaluate the vascular characteristics of adnexal masses. MRI Pelvis without contrast (CPT\u00ae OR without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 72197; CPT\u00ae 72195 if pregnant) if ultrasound does not identify the origin of the pelvic mass (adnexal, uterine, or other in etiology ). If the mass is unrelated to female pelvic anatomy, See Abdominal Mass (AB- 13) in the Abdomen Imaging Guidelines The uterus, tubes and ovaries arise out of the pelvis and are considered pelvic organs. If the uterus rises out of the pelvic cavity, the imaging field can be determined on scout films. Imaging of the abdomen is not supported for problems suspected to arise from the pelvis. Background and Supporting Information Consultation with or referral to a gynecologic oncologist is recommended for women with an adnexal mass who meet one or more of the following criteria: 7 Postmenopausal with elevated CA -125 level , ultrasound findings suggestive of malignancy, ascites, a nodular or fixed pelvic mass, or evidence of abdominal or distant metastasis.7 Premenopausal with very elevated CA -125 level, ultrasound findings suggestive of malignancy, ascites, a nodular or fixed pelvic mass, or evidence of abdominal or dis tant metastasis . 7 Premenopausal or postmenopausal with an elevated score on a formal risk assessment test such as the multivariate index assay, risk of malignancy index, or the Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm or one of the ultrasound- based scoring systems from the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis group. 7 Simple and Complex Adnexal Cysts Simple cysts are smooth walled and clear without debris. Complex cysts can have solid areas or excrescences, and/or debris in them, greater than 3mm irregular septations, mural nodules with Doppler -detected blood flow, and/or free abdominal/pelvic fluid.

CA-125 is a tumor marker that is useful for the evaluation of adnexal mass: Elevation occurs with both malignant (epithelial cancer) and benign entities (leiomyoma, endometriosis, PID, inflammatory disease such as lupus, and inflammatory bowel disease). Increase in the markers over time occurs with malignancy only Consider tumor markers in individual s with an abnormal ultrasound that is not a simple cyst Other markers include Beta hCG, LDH, and AFP (germ cell tumors) and Inhibin A and B (granulosa cell tumor). Simple Cysts ( PV-5.2) Simple cysts are smooth, thin walled, anechoic and clear without debris. Simple cysts up to 10 cm in diameter as measured by ultrasound are almost universally benign.

An ovarian mass suspicious for metastatic disease (e.g. from breast, uterine, colorectal or gastric cancer) should be evaluated based on the appropriate Oncology Imaging Guidelines. Post -Menopausal - see table above For post -menopausal women, most pelvic complex cysts or solid masses should be evaluated for surgical intervention and have tumor markers ( i.e. CA-125) measured. Some women for whom the usual management of a pelvic mass would include surgery may be at increased risk for perioperative morbidity and mortality. In such cases, repeat imaging may be a safer alternative than immediate surgery, although the frequency of follow -up imaging has not been determined.

Background and Supporting Information With regards to fecal incontinence ACG Guidelines note that \"the internal sphincter is visualized more clearly by endoanal ultrasound, whereas MRI is superior for discriminating between an external anal sphincter tear and a scar and for identifying external sphincter atrophy. However, guidelines adopted by the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons note that \"Endoanal ultrasound is a useful and sensitive tool in the evaluation of patients with FI (fecal incontinence), especially when there is a history of vaginal delivery or anorectal surgery. Ultrasound can reliably identify internal and external sphincter defects that may be associated with sphincter dysunction.\" In addition, the guidelines note \"Other modalities (eg, MRI) have shown substantial interobserver variability and, at this point, are likely inferior to ultrasound imaging, but they may provide additional information where endoanal ultrasound is unavailable.\" Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Peripheral Nerve Disorders (PND) Imaging Guidelines General Guidelines (PN-1) General Guidelines (PN-1.0 ) A pertinent clinical evaluation is required before advanced imaging can be considered. The clinical evaluation should include a pertinent history and physical examination, including a neurological examination, since the onset or change in symptoms , appropriate laboratory studies, non- advanced imaging modalities, electromyography and nerve conduction (EMG/NCV) studies. Other meaningful technological contact (telehealth visit, telephone call or video call , electronic mail or messaging) since the onset or change in symptoms , by an established individual can serve as a pertinent clinical evaluation. Nerve conduction studies are often normal early in the disease course with changes occurring from one to four weeks after symptom onset in the majority of individual s. This will be taken into consideration on a case by case basis in regards to the NCV/EMG requirement in each section requirement of Peripheral Nerve Disorders Imaging Guidelines . During the current COVID -19 pandemic, with limited face- to-face visits, the electrodiagnostic (EMG/NCV) study requirements may be waived with necessity to be determined by the treating neurologist or team coordinating the individual 's care. If imaging of peripheral nerves is indicated, ultrasound is the preferred modality for superficial peripheral nerves. MRI may be used for imaging deep nerves such as the lumbosacral plexus or nerves obscured by overlying bone such as the brachial plexus or for surgical planning . CT is limited to cases in which MRI is contraindicated. Reference s 1.Bowen BC, Maravilla KR, Saraf -Lavi. Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Peripheral Nervous System.

Gaucher disease is a treatable disorder (enzymereplacement) in which the liver, spleen, and bone marrow/bones are the mostaffected organs. Diagnosis is established by decreased enzyme activity or genetic testing. Three major types of Gaucher disease are recognized: Type I (non- neuropathic form or adult form): progressive hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia and thrombocytopenia, and marked skeletal involvement; lungs and kidneys may also be involved, but central nervous system is spared Type II (acute neuropathic form or infantile form): severe progressive neurological involvement and death by 2 to 4 years of age; hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, is also present (usually evident by 6 months of age) Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Prior to advanced imaging the following is required: Clinical history should include the time course of symptoms, any associatedweakness, areas of involvement, as well as the presence or absence of pain, sensory loss, or sphincter dysfunction. Laboratory investigation consists of complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, serum calcium, thyroid function testing, vitamin B12 level, sed rate, ANA, rheumatoid factor, and serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation.

Although classically thought of as a disease of the temporal arteries, aortic arch involvement is now recognized as a frequent complication (up to 50% of individuals) and responsible for many of the more serious morbidities encountered such as blindness. GCA may be subdivided into two basic types; Cranial and Extra-cranial oCranial GCA is the more common type with temporal artery involvement. For predominantly Cranial GCA: US (CPT\u00ae 93880 or CPT\u00ae 93882) of the temporal (and or axillary) arteries is the preferred modality. Ultrasound should be considered prior to advanced imaging. MRA Head and/or MRA Neck (CPT\u00ae 70544, or CPT\u00ae 70545, when: Vascular trained ultrasonography is not available US is negative or equivocal with a clinical suspicion of GCA CT and PET are not currently recommended for the assessment of inflammation of cranial arteries.

Evaluation and surveillance MRI without contrast or without and with contrast of the affected body part is the study of choice for abdominal AVMs and deep tissue (below the skin) AVM's in the limbs. MRA (contrast as requested) of the affected body part can be approved for evaluation and surveillance of known AVMs. It is unusual for both MRI and MRA to be necessary for routine treatment response or surveillance imaging of AVMs, but both may be approved for preoperative planning. CT and CTA can also be used to characterize AVMs and their relationship to normal structures, but is generally not better than MRI and has associated radiation risks. oCT with contrast and/or CTA (contrast as requested) of the affected body part can be approved when MRI and/or MRA is inconclusive or contraindicated.

Background and Supporting Information Arteriovenous malformations are characterized by a network of multiple abnormal vascular channels interposed between enlarged feeding arteries and draining veins. The arteriovenous fistula has a single communication interposed between a feeding artery and a draining vein. The normal capillary bed is absent in both lesions. Both lesions may have an aggressive clinical course and are characterized by a reddish pulsatile mass which has a thrill or bruit. Though often recognized at birth, these lesions may grow and present near adolescence. References 1. Pizzo PA, Poplack DG, Krishnamurthy R, Daldrup-Link HE, Jones JY, et. al.

Incompletely lysed DVT can cause luminal narrowing of the vein restricting venous outflow leading to stenosis or occlusion and /or can lead to valve dysfunction resulting in reflux of venous blood retrograde towards gravity. Both pathologies ultimately lead to chronic edema which can cause chronic pain and venous stasis disease. oThe mainstay of treatment for chronic deep venous thrombosis is compression stockings oSelected individuals may be a candidate for iliac vein angioplasty/stenting.

Treatment of superficial venous reflux is amenable to intervention in selected individuals who are symptomatic and have failed conservative therapy. A duplex ultrasound (CPT\u00ae 93970 bilateral study or CPT\u00ae 93971 unilateral study) demonstrating the presence of pathologic reflux within the greater and lesser saphenous veins should be undertaken within the last six months. Vein size should be documented. A post ablation venous ultrasound (CPT\u00ae 93970 bilateral study or CPT\u00ae 93971 unilateral study) is indicated within seven days post procedure. If thrombus is noted within the saphenofemoral junction, repeat imaging can be performed within seven days to assess for propagation into the deep system. Ultrasound mapping or monitoring techniques are considered medically necessary only to initially determine the extent and configuration of symptomatic varicosities or valvular insufficiency. Post procedure assessment by imaging techniques is inappropriate to confirm efficacy or outcome of the procedure. Background and Supporting Information Venous insufficiency -- General information Venous insufficiency is characterized by failure of the venous blood to flow in its normal antegrade path of flow and instead reflux backwards by the force of gravity usually secondary to malfunction of the venous valves. Risk factors include previous DVT, obesity, female sex assigned at birth, hereditary, and environmental factors such as prolonged standing on a hard surface. Venous insufficiency loosely includes the diagnosis of venous reflux, varicose veins, venous stasis ulcers and spider/reticular veins. Venous reflux Symptoms of reflux include chronic edema, pain, and venous stasis ulcerations. Symptoms of venous reflux can be ameliorated with compression Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCPeripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 therapy with graded compression stockings, elevation, avoidance of prolonged standing and weight loss. Venous reflux can be seen in both the deep and superficial venous systems. Reflux within the deep system is not amenable to intervention. Treatment of deep venous reflux is via active compression with compression stocks, pneumatic pumps or specialized dressings such as Unna boots. Treatment of symptomatic superficial venous reflux is via endovenous laser radiofrequency ablation of the greater or lesser saphenous vein resulting in closure of the vein allowing for venous blood to be rerouted to the deep venous system. Treatment of symptomatic superficial venous reflux can also be treated via saphenous vein ligation and stripping which has fallen out of favor but can be performed for a tortuous or enlarged (>15mm) greater or lesser saphenous vein. One complication of endovenous ablation is deep venous thrombosis. Varicose Veins If the varicosities remain symptomatic despite conservative therapy, varicose veins are treated with sclerotherapy or phlebectomy generally on the basis of size. Varicose veins are defined as enlarged, tortuous veins visible under the skin. Symptoms associated with varicose veins include achiness and heaviness of the legs and pain/discomfort over the varicosities. Varicose veins can exist both in the absence and presence of venous reflux. Treatment involves conservative therapy such as compression stockings, avoidance of prolonged standing, intermittent elevation, weight loss (if applicable) and exercise which relieves the distention of the varicose veins ameliorating the symptoms. Spider veins/reticular veins Spider veins are formed by the dilation of a cluster of blood vessels within the dermis - generally <3mm in diameter. Diagnosis is via physical examination. Spider veins are usually asymptomatic but can cause aching, burning and tenderness in the area overlying the abnormal veins. Spider veins can exist in the absence or presence of venous reflux. The presence of spider veins should not be an indication for treatment of venous reflux. Treatment of spider veins is generally cosmetic except in certain cases and can be treated with sclerotherapy.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Spine Imaging Guidelines General Guidelines (SP-1.0) Before advanced diagnostic imaging can be considered, there must be an in -person clinical evaluation as well as a clinical re -evaluation after a trial of failed conservative therapy; the clinical re- evaluation may consist of an in -person evaluation or other meaningful contact with the provider's office such as email, web, or telephone communications. An in-person clinical evaluation for the current episode of the condition is required to have been performed before advanced imaging is considered. This may have been either the initial clinical evaluation or a clinical re -evaluation. The in-person clinical evaluation should include a relevant history and physical examination (including a detailed neurological examination), appropriate laboratory studies, non- advanced imaging modalities, results of manual motor testing, the specific dermatomal distribution of altered sensation, reflex examination, and nerve root tension signs ( e.g., straight leg raise test, slump test, femoral nerve tension test). The clinical evaluation must be in -person; other forms of meaningful contact (telephone call, electronic mail , telemedicine, or messaging) are not acceptable as an in-person evaluation. For those spinal conditions/disorders for which the Spine Imaging Guidelines require a plain x -ray of the spine prior to consideration of an advanced imaging study, the plain x -ray must be performed after the current episode of symptoms started or changed and results need to be available to the requesting provider of the advanced imaging study (see : Anatomic Guidelines (SP-2.1)). Clinical re -evaluation is required prior to consideration of advanced diagnostic imaging to document failure of significant clinical improvement following a recent (within 3 months) six week trial of provider -directed treatment. Clinical re- evaluation can include documentation of an in -person encounter or documentation of other meaningful contact with the requesting provider's office by the individual (e.g., telephone call, electronic mail, telemedicine, or messaging) . Provider -directed treatment may include education, activity modification, steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs), or corticosteroids, a provider -directed home exercise/stretching program, cross -training, avoidance of aggravating activities, physical/occupational therapy, spinal manipulation, interventional pain procedures and other pain management techniques. Any bowel/bladder abnormalities or emergent or urgent indications should be documented at the time of the initial clinical evaluat ion and clinical re -evaluation. Altered sensation to pressure, pain, and temperature should be documented by the specific anatomic distribution ( e.g., dermatomal , stocking/glove or mixed distribution ). Motor deficits (weakness) should be defined by the specific myotomal distribution (e.g., weakness of toe flexion/extension, knee flexion/extension, ankle dorsi/plantar flexion, wrist dorsi/palmar flexion) and of testing should be documented as follows: Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Asymmetric reflexes and reflex examination should be documented as follows: Grading of Reflex Testing 0 No response 1+ A slight but definitely present response 2+ A brisk response 3+ A very brisk response without clonus 4+ A tap elicits a repeating reflex (clonus) Advanced diagnostic imaging is often urgently indicated and may be necessary if serious underlying spinal and/or non- spinal disease is suggested by the presence of certain patient factors referred to as \"red flags.\" See : Red Flag Indications (SP- 1.2). Spinal specialist evaluation can be helpful in determining the need for advanced diagnostic imaging, especially for individuals following spinal surgery. The need for repeat advanced diagnostic imaging should be carefully considered and may not be indicated if prior advanced diagnostic imaging has been performed. Requests for simultaneous, similar studies such as spinal MRI and CT need to be documented as required for preoperative surgical planning. These studies may be helpful in the evaluation of complex failed spinal fusion cases or needed for preoperative surgical planning when the determination of both soft tissue and bony anatomy is required. Serial advanced imaging, whether CT or MRI, for surveillance of healing or recovery from spinal disease is not supported by the currently available scientific evidence- based medicine for the majority of spinal disorders. Requests for repeat imaging may be considered on a case- by-case basis (e.g. concern for delayed union or non -union of spinal fracture, p seudoarthrosis of fusion, etc.) Advanced imaging is generally unnecessary for resolved or improving spinal pain and/or radiculopathy. Advanced diagnostic imaging has not been shown to be of value in individuals with stable, longstanding spinal pain without neurological features or without clinically significant or relevant changes in symptoms or physical examination findings. Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Spine Imaging Guidelines Anatomic regions of the spine/pelvis that are included in the following MRI and CT advanced diagnostic imaging studies: Cervical spine: from CT or MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine will image the entire spinal cord since the end of the spinal cord or conus medullaris usually ends at L1 in adults. Therefore, lumbar spine imaging is not needed when the goal is to image only the spinal cord unless there is known or suspected low lying conus medullaris (e.g. tethered cord). General Considerations (SP-1.1) See: General Guidelines (SP-1.0) Background and Supporting Information Straight leg raise test (also known as the Lasegue's test) - With the individual in the supine position, the hip medially rotated and adducted, and the knee extended, the examiner flexes the hip until the individual complains of pain or tightness in the back or back of the leg. If the pain is primarily back pain, it is less specific whereas if the pain is primarily in the leg, it is more likely nerve root irritation/radiculopathy . Disc herniation or pathology causing pressure between the two extremes are more likely to cause pain in both areas. The examiner then slowly and carefully drops the leg back (extends it) slightly until the individual feels no pain or tightness. The individual is then asked to flex the neck so the chin is on the chest, or the examiner may dorsiflex the individual's foot, or both actions may be done simultaneously. Both of these maneuvers are considered to be provocative tests for neurological tissue. Slump test - The individual is seated on the edge of the examination table with the legs supported, the hips in neutral position, and the hands behind the back. The examination is performed in sequential steps. First, the individual is asked to \"slump\" the back into thoracic and lumbar flexion. The examiner maintains the individual 's chin in neutral position to prevent neck and head flexion. The examiner then uses one arm to apply overpressure across the shoulders to maintain flexion of the thoracic and lumbar spines. While this position is held, the individual is asked to actively flex the cervical spine and head as far as possible (i.e., chin to chest). The examiner then applies overpressure to maintain flexion of all three parts of the spine (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar) using the hand of the same arm to maintain overpressure in the cervical spine. With the other hand, the examiner then holds the individual's foot in maximum dorsiflexion. While the examiner holds these positions, the individual is asked to actively straighten the knee as much as possible. The test is repeated with the other leg and then with both legs at the same time. If the individual is unable to fully extend the knee because of pain, the examiner releases the overpressure to the cervical spine and the individual actively extends the neck. If the knee extends further, the symptoms decrease with neck extension, or the positioning of the individual increases the individual's symptoms, then the test is considered positive. Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Spine Imaging Guidelines Femoral nerve tension test (also known as the prone knee bending test) - The individual lies prone while the examiner passively flexes the knee as far as possible so that the individual's heel rests against the buttock. At the same time, the examiner should ensure that the individual's hip is not rotated. If the examiner is unable to flex the individual's knee past 90 degrees because of a pathological condition in the hip, the test may be performed by passive extension of the hip while the knee is flexed as much as possible. The flexed knee position should be maintained for 45 to 60 seconds. Unilateral neurological pain in the lumbar area, buttock, and/or posterior thigh may indicate an L2 or L3 nerve root lesion. Pain in the anterior thigh indicates tight quadriceps muscles or stretching of the femoral nerve. Hoffmann's sign - The examiner holds the individual's middle finger and briskly flicks the distal phalanx. A positive test is noted if the interphalangeal joint of the thumb of the same hand flexes. Babinski's sign - The examiner runs a sharp instrument along the plantar surface of the foot from the calcaneus along the lateral border to the forefoot. A positive test occurs with extension of the great toe with flexion and splaying of the other toes. A negative test occurs with no movement of the toes at all or uniform bunching up of the toes. Chaddock sign - The examiner strokes the lateral malleolus. A positive test occurs with ex tension of the great toe. Red Flag Indications (SP-1.2) Red Flag Indications are intended to represent the potential for life or limb threatening conditions. Red Flag Indications are clinical situations in which localized spine pain and associated neurolog ical features are likely to reflect serious underlying spinal and/or non-spinal disease and warrant exception to the requirement for documented failure of six weeks of provider -directed treatment. Advanced diagnostic imaging of the symptomatic level is appropriate and/or work -up for a non- spinal source of spine pain for Red Flag Indications.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Spine Imaging Guidelines Background and Supporting Information Provocative Discography/CT and MR Spectroscopy of the lumbar spine are procedures purported to diagnose (or rule- out) a discogenic \"pain generator\" i.e., the source of non- specific axial spinal pain. These diagnostic studies , when reported as positive, are often used as an indication for spinal fusion in individuals with non - specific axial back pain. The following uses of discography are considered controversial: To identify a symptomatic pseudoarthrosis in a failed spinal fusion. To identify which of two herniated discs seen on MRI is symptomatic when not determined clinically or otherwise. To confirm the discogenic nature of pain in an individual with an abnormal disc seen on MRI and to rule out pain from an adjacent disc level. To confirm the presumptive diagnosis of \"internal disc disruption\". Discography of the cervical and/or thoracic spine. The following uses of MR Spectroscopy of the lumbar spine are considered controversial: To identify which of two herniated discs seen on MRI is symptomatic when not determined clinically or otherwise. To confirm the discogenic nature of pain in an individual with an abnormal disc seen on MRI and to rule out pain from an adjacent disc level. To confirm the presumptive diagnosis of \"internal disc disruption\". Ultrasound of the Spinal Canal (SP-2.6) Spinal canal ultrasound (CPT\u00ae 76800) describes the evaluation of the spinal cord (canal and contents) most often performed in newborns, infants, young children and intraoperatively. CPT\u00ae 76800 describes evaluation of the entire spine and should not be reported multiple times for imaging of different areas of the spinal canal. CPT\u00ae 76998, rather than CPT\u00ae 76800, should be used to report intraoperative spinal canal ultrasound (ultrasonic guidance). Intraoperative use of spinal ultrasound (CPT \u00ae 76998) would not require prior authorization by eviCore. Indications for spinal canal ultrasound (C PT\u00ae 76800): This study is generally limited to infants, newborns and young children because of incomplete ossification of the vertebral segments surrounding the spinal cord, including the assessment of CSF in the spinal canal and for image- guided lumbar puncture. When ossification of the vertebral segments is incomplete for evaluation of suspect ed or known tethered cord (see: Tethered Cord (PEDSP- 5) in the Pediatric Spine Imaging Guidelines ). Evaluation of suspected occult the Pediatric Spine Imaging Guidelines ). Evaluation of spinal cord tumors, vascular malformations and cases of birth- related trauma. Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Spine Imaging Guidelines Contraindicated for use in the adult spine for the assessment of spinal pain, radiculopathy, facet inflammation, nerve root inflammation, disc herniation, and soft tissue conditions surrounding the adult spine other than for superficial masses . Limitations of Spinal Imaging in Degenerative Disorders (SP-2.7) Non-specific axial spinal pain is ubiquitous. Advanced diagnostic imaging infrequently identifies the source of the spinal pain (pain generator). Incidental findings on MRI and CT, including bulging, protruding, extruding or herniated discs, are often non- concordant, asymptomatic and increase in incidence as the spine ages. In individuals with poorly defined clinical presentations, \"abnormal\" spinal advanced diagnostic imaging results are infrequently clinically concordant, significant, material or substantive and may even lead to inappropriate treatment. Performing advanced spinal imaging based only on the presence of spinal degenerative findings identified on x -rays is not generally indicated in individuals who are either asymptomatic or present with non- specific axial spinal pain. Miscellaneous Spinal Lesions (SP-2.8) Vertebral body hemangiomas: Vertebral body hemangiomas are common and are generally benign and incidental findings on plain x -rays and advanced diagnostic imaging studies. If the appearance of a vertebral body hemangioma is typical on plain x -ray, further spinal advanced diagnostic imaging is not usually required, unless there are associated neurologic symptoms or signs on physical examination. If the appearance of a vertebral body hemangioma is atypical on plain x -ray, with or without neurological signs or symptoms on physical exam, MRI without contrast or MRI without and with contrast is indicated. Occasionally, MRI may be equivocal, indeterminate or non- diagnostic and CT without contrast of the spinal area is indicated to help clarify the diagnosis. No follow- up imaging is necessary once the diagnosis of a vertebral body hemangioma is established without neurological features. Tarlov cysts: cysts are most often cystic dilatations of nerve root sleeves in the lum bar spine and sacrum. Controversy exists as to whether Tarlov cysts can result in neurologic signs and symptoms but they can result in erosion of the adjacent bone. Usually Tarlov cysts are benign, incidental findings on advanced diagnostic imaging studies . Further evaluation of a known or suspected Tarlov cyst can be performed with a n MRI Lumbar Spine without and with contrast study ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Spine Imaging Guidelines Other spinal lesions: MRI without and with contrast or a CT without contrast is appropriate if: Other spinal lesions are seen on routine x -rays or a non -contrast MRI; and These additional advanced imaging studies are recommended by a spine specialist or radiologist to further characterize or diagnose the lesion; or Required for surgical planning. MRA Spinal Canal (SP-2.9) Spine MRA imaging is utilized infrequently. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) flow studies using MRI are included in CPT\u00ae codes 70551, 70552, and 70553 and should not be coded or reported separately. Indic ations may include: arteriovenous fistula (AVF): MRI Spine of the relevant spine region without and with contrast should be the initial imaging study. If suspicion for a spinal AVM or AVF is high based upon the results of the MRI Spine , catheter angiography been previously identified Catheter angiography (CPT\u00ae 70496) should be performed and is the most definitive study to define possible spinal pathology resulting in a spinal canal subarachnoid hemorrhage. See: General Guidelines - CT and M MRA) (HD- 1.5) See: Intracranial Aneurysms (HD-12.1) Preoperative planning Spinal canal MRA may be useful in identifying major intercostal feeder vessels to the spinal cord prior to surgical procedures that might interfere with this blood supply. However, catheter angiography (CPT \u00ae 72159) is generally a more definitive study for this purpose. Spine PET/CT (SP-2.10) At the present time there is controversy regarding spine PET/CT due to inadequate scientific evidence to support the medical necessity of PET/CT for the routine assessment of spinal disorders, other than for neoplastic di sease. See: Bone (including Vertebral) Metastases (ONC -31. 5) Spine PET /CT should investigational .

Electrodiagnostic testing (EMGs/NCVs) is generally used to confirm, not establish, a diagnosis of peripheral nerve entrapment and/or a motor/sensory neuropathy based upon history and physical examination findings. Electrodiagnostic testing is often considered when advanced imaging of the spine does not reveal neurocompressive pathology and/or after 6 weeks of unimproved symptoms of extremity pain, weakness, numbness and/or tingling. Individuals with ankylosing spondylitis or DISH are at high risk of cervical spine fractures even with minor direct/indirect trauma to the cervical spine which can result in quadriparesis/quadriplegia References 1.

Examination findings may include loss of manual dexterity, spastic legs and ataxia with hyperreflexia and upgoing toes (positive Babinski), Hoffmann 's sign, sustained clonus, Lhermitte's sign, crossed radial reflex, inverted radial reflex and finger escape sign. Sensory level and urinary incontinence/retention may be seen. Advanced imaging is generally appropriate in the initial evaluation of documented or reasonably suspected myelopathy. MRI Cervical and Thoracic Spine without contrast, or without and with contrast, are appropriate for: Evaluation of reasonably suspected myelopathy . Post-traumatic syrinx with increased spinal pain or a worsening neurological symptoms. Sustained, prominent, and unexplained Lhermitte's sign. Unexplained Babinski's or Hoffmann's sign s. Unexplained hyperreflexia. Unexplained bilateral motor weakness. MRI Cervical, Thoracic , and Lumbar Spine without contrast, or without and with contrast, are appropriate for: Suspected tethered cord and/or low lying conus medullaris. Conservative treatment is not a requirement for advanced imaging in individuals with potential myelopathy. CT without contrast, or CT with contrast (myelography) , can also be considered for either of the following: An alternative to MRI, when MRI is contraindicated In addition to MRI, for surgical planning For surgery criteria, see the following: CMM -601: Ant erior Cervical or without -605: Cervical Microdiscectomy Background and Supporting Information Lhermitte's sign - With the individua l in the long leg sitting position on the examination table, the examiner passively flexes the individual's head and one hip simultaneously with the leg kept straight.

Pars interarticularis defects can be an incidental finding on plain x -rays and is frequently asymptomatic. Spondylolisthesis is the forward (anterolisthesis) or backward (retrolisthesis, usually not clinically significant) displacement of one vertebra in relation to an adjacent vertebra, most commonly at L4- 5 and L5- S1, although other levels of the spine may be involved. Spondylolisthesis is often an incidental finding on plain x -ray and is frequently asymptomatic. References 1. Rao, RD, Smuck M. Orthopaedic Knowledge Update 4: Spine. AAOS. 41:477- 478. 2.

A CT/Myelogram Lumbar Spine (CPT\u00ae 72132) may also be considered for individuals who have failed 6- weeks of provider -directed treatment if requested by the operating surgeon for surgical planning, especially for multi -level lumbar spinal stenosis. For surgery Information Lumbar spinal stenosis refers to a decrease in the space available for the neural elements within the spinal canal that include spinal nerve roots and the cauda equina. It is usually a degenerative condition of the aging spine which can be asymptomatic or a common cause of buttock/low back and/or leg pain (neurogenic claudication) in this population. Neurogenic claudication is a common symptom of lumbar spinal stenosis that is aggravated by walking, especially down hills or stairs, with prolonged standing and is often relieved by sitting and bending forward. Neurogenic claudication should be differentiated from vascular claudication (leg/calf pain) that is often aggravated by walking and relieved fairly rapidly by stopping and rest. The differential diagnosis for lumbar spinal stenosis should include peripheral vascular disease, hip disorders and peripheral neuropathy. References 1. Patel ND, Broderick D F, Burns J, et. al.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Spine Imaging Guidelines Background and Supporting Information Sacroiliitis can present with pain localized to the SI joint or referred pain to the buttock and/or posterior thigh without neurologic signs or symptoms. Affected individuals can often point to the SI joint as the pain source. Provocative and/or therapeutic SI joint anesthetic/corticosteroid injections can have diagnostic value. There is no evidence demonstrating that advanced diagnostic imaging substantiates changes to patient managem ent decisions in individuals with proven SI joint disorders when visible on routine plain x -rays. MRI has shown inflammatory changes in the SI joints prior to visible x -ray changes in several studies. However, the ability of MRI to characterize inflammation in early ankylosing spondylitis, the ability of MRI to predict erosive changes, and the value of monitoring treatment effects using serial MRI studies remains controversial and investigational in adults.

Low bone mineral density is the primary etiology for most of these fractures but could also occur in the setting of other bone disease and medical conditions, in addition to neoplastic disease and infection. Sudden localized back pain, with or without trauma, is a typical presentatio n of insufficiency/low energy spinal compression fractures and can often be an incidental finding on plain x -rays and can be asymptomatic.

A meaningful technological contact (telehealth visit, telephone call, electronic mail or messaging) since the onset or change in symptoms can serve as a pertinent clinical evaluation. These guidelines are based upon using advanced imaging to answer specific clinical questions that will affect individual management. Imaging is not indicated if the results will not affect individual management decisions. Standard medical practice would dictate continuing conservative therapy prior to advanced imaging in individuals who are improving on current treatment programs. Unless otherwise stated in a specific guideline section, the use of advanced imaging to screen asymptomatic individuals for disorders involving the abdomen is not supported. Advanced imaging should only be approved in individuals who have documented active clinical signs or symptoms of disease. Unless otherwise stated in a specific guideline section, repeat imaging studies of the same body area are not necessary unless there is evidence for progression of disease, new onset of disease, and/or documentation of how repeat imaging will affect individual management or treatment decisions. Ultrasound Ultrasound should be the initial imaging study of choice in most children with abdominal conditions and should be done prior to advanced imaging. For those individuals who do require advanced imaging after ultrasound, ultrasound can be very beneficial in selecting the proper modality, body area, image sequences, and contrast level that will provide the most definitive information for the individual . CPT \u00ae codes vary by bo dy area and presence or absence of Doppler imaging and are included in the table at the beginning of this guideline. Red Flags Children with abdominal pain AND ANY of the following red flag signs or symptoms require additional investigation. The initial ultrasound is not required. Additional labs may be helpful but are not required. Pain that wakes the child from sleep Unexplained fever (T >100.4\u00b0F) History of malignancy with a likelihood or propensity to metastasize to abdomen Dysphagia GI bleeding Significant vomiting Elevated WBC per the testing laboratory's range Guarding, rebound tenderness, or other peritoneal signs Severe chronic diarrhea or nocturnal diarrhea in a toilet -trained child Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

The appropriate advanced imaging for the condition is listed in the condition-specific section. Pediatric Abdominal Imaging Age Considerations (PEDAB -1.1) Many conditions affecting the abdomen in the pediatric population are different diagnoses than those occurring in the adult population. For those diseases that occur in both pediatric and adult populations , differences may exist in management due to individual age, comorbidities, and differences in disease natural history between children and adults. Individuals age 18 years old and younger 13 should be imaged according to the Pediatric Abdomen Imaging Guidelines if discussed. Any conditions not specifically discussed in the Pediatric Abdomen Imaging Guidelines should be imaged according to the General Abdomen Imaging Guidelines . Individuals age >18 years old should be imaged according to the General Abdomen Imaging Guidelines, except where directed otherwise by a specific guideline section.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Pediatric Abdomen Imaging Guidelines Pediatric Abdomen Imaging Modality General Considerations (PEDAB -1.3) Ultrasound See: General Guidelines ( PEDAB- 1.0) MRI MRI Abdomen is generally performed without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 74183) unless the individual has a documented contraindication to gadolinium or otherwise stated in a specific guideline section. Due to the length of time required for MRI acquisition and the need to minimize individual movement , anesthesia is usually required for almost all infants (except neonates) and young children (age <7 years) as well as older children with delays in development or maturity. This anesthesia may be administered via oral or intravenous routes. In this individual population, MRI sessions should be planned with a goal of minimizing anesthesia exposure by adhering to the following considerations: MRI procedures can be performed without and/or with contrast use as supported by these condition- based guidelines. If intravenous access will already be present for anesthesia administration and there is no contraindication for using contrast , imaging without and with contrast may be appropriate if requested. By doing so, the requesting provider may avoid repetitive anesthesia administration to perform an MRI with contrast i f the initial study without contrast is inconclusive. Recent evidence based literature demonstrates the potential for gadolinium deposition in various organs including the brain, after the use of MRI contrast. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has noted that there is currently no evidence to suggest that gadolinium retention in the brain is harmful and restricting gadolinium -based contrast agents (GBCAs) use is not warranted at this time. It has been recommended that GBCA use should be limited to circumstances in which additional information provided by the contrast agent is necessary and the necessity of repetitive MRIs with GBCAs should be assessed. If multiple body areas are supported by eviCore's guidelines for the clinical condition being evaluated, MRI of all necessary body areas should be obtained concurrently in the same session. The presence of surgical hardware or implanted devices may preclude MRI. The selection of best examination may require coordination between the provider and the imaging service. CT may be the procedure of choice in these cases .

In general, CT A bdomen is appropriate when evaluating solid abdominal organs. In general, CT Abdomen and Pelvis is appropriate when evaluating inflammatory or infectious processes, hematuria, or conditions that appear to involve both the abdomen and the pelvis. In some cases, especially in follow -up of a known finding, it may be appropriate to limit the exam to the region of concern to reduce radiation exposure. The contrast level in pediatric CT imaging is specific to the clinical indication, as listed in the specific guideline sections . CT Abdomen or Abdomen and Pelvis may be indicated for further evaluation of abnormalities suggested on prior US or MRI studies . CT may be indicated without prior MR I or US, as indicated in specific sections of these guidelines . CT should not be used to replace MRI in an attempt to avoid sedation unless listed as a recommended study in a specific guideline section. The selection of the best examination may require coordination between the provider and the imaging service. Nuclear Medicine Nuclear medicine studies are commonly used in evaluation of the pediatric kidney and gallbladder .

Functional abdominal pain disorders, including functional abdominal pain and functional dyspepsia (including symptoms of epigastric pain, burning, postprandial fullness, early satiety), are conditions in which there is no structural or organic disease. Children with no red flag signs or symptoms, normal physical examination, and normal laboratory studies (preliminary labs may and stool culture if diarrhea), should initially be evaluated by ultrasound (CPT \u00ae 76700 or CPT\u00ae 76705) and treated conservatively.

In the neonates, the common masses are adrenal hemorrhage and neuroblastoma. Abdominal US is the initial imaging study of choice. If an adrenal mass is detected, it can often be adequately evaluated with short interval follow -up retroperitoneal ultrasound (CPT \u00ae 76770) in 7 to 10 days. If repeat ultrasound is concerning for neuroblastoma or there is high clinical concern for neuroblastoma, MRI Abdomen without and with contrast (CPT \u00ae 74183) or CT Abdomen without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 74170) are indicated to confirm the diagnosis.

See : Hereditary (Primary) Hemochromatosis (HH) and Other Iron Storage Diseases ( AB-11.2) in the Abdomen Imaging Guidelines . Hemochromatosis ( PEDAB-18 .2) Transfusion- associated hemochromatosis is a common complication of exposure to repeated red blood cell transfusions. This can occur in any individual with exposure to >20 transfusion episodes, but is most common among sickle cell disease, thalassemia, bone marrow failure (aplastic anemia, Fanconi anemia, etc.), oncology patients, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients. T2* MRI has been well established in the determination of organ iron burden in transfusion- associated hemochromatosis. Contrast use is not necessary for evaluation of iron burden. The following studies are indicated for evaluation of transfusion- associated hemochromatosis: MRI Abdomen without contrast (CPT \u00ae 74181) for liver iron evaluation. MRI Cardiac without contrast (CPT\u00ae 75557) for cardiac iron evaluation. MRI Chest without contrast (CPT\u00ae 71550) can be approved as a single study to evaluate both heart and liver iron burden. CPT\u00ae 74181 and CPT\u00ae 75557 can be approved alone, or together. If requested, CPT\u00ae 71550 will evaluate both heart and liver and should not be approved with any other codes. Screening MRI is indicated every 12 months for chronically transfused individuals at risk of hemochromatosis. Imaging is indicated every 3 months for treatment response in individuals receiving active treatment (chelation and/or phlebotomy). References 1.

It may be associated with bloody stool. Plain x - rays (supine and left lateral decubitus views) should be performed initially to exclude mass or bowel obstruction from other causes and to detect possible bowel perforation, which may be an indication for emergent surgical intervention. Ultrasound (CPT \u00ae 76700 or CPT\u00ae 76705) is indicated as an initial study if there is a strong suspicion for intussusception, but if negative, plain x -rays of the abdomen should follow.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Pediatric Abdomen Imaging Guidelines Vomiting Infant, Malrotation, and Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (PEDAB- 33) Vomiting in infants is generally classified as either bilious (implying obstruction distal to the Sphincter of Oddi) or non- bilious. Bilious vomiting may be a true emergency, as some of the conditions causing this could result in compromise of blood supply to the intestines, a potentially life- threatening situation. Nonbilious vomiting in otherwise healthy infants may be imaged with Upper GI series (UGI) Suspected malrotation is an indication for emergent imaging. If malrotation with mid-gut volvulus is suspected, acute abdominal series ( Chest X- ray and abdominal views, including supine and upright or supine and left lateral decubitus views), followed by UGI series (preferred) and/or Ultrasound abdomen, limited (CPT \u00ae 76705) should be performed. If the abdominal X -rays suggest distal bowel obstruction, water soluble contrast enema should be considered. Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis is an idiopathic condition wherein the circular muscle controlling emptying of the stomach thickens, causing a relative obstruction of the gastric outlet. The condition can occur at any age (including occasionally in adults), but the typical child is male, aged 2 to 6 weeks. Projectile non- bilious vomiting is the most common presenting complaint, but the description of projectile vomiting is subjective. The differential diagnosis for non- bilious vomiting includes common conditions such as viral gastroenteritis and gastro- esophageal reflux. Infants with projectile non- bilious vomiting should be evaluated with U ltrasound abdomen, limited (CPT \u00ae 76705). If initial studies are not diagnostic, repeat studies should be performed, as frequently as daily, until the vomiting resolves or the diagnosis is made. UGI series may be useful as a confirmatory test, may be preferred if ultrasound expertise is not available for this condition, or if the clinical presentation is atypical for Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis. Ultrasound is preferred when available, as it involves no contrast or ionizing radiation use. References 1. Hunter AK and Liacouras CA. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics.

Pediatric individuals can have acquired heart disease unique to children. For those diseases which occur in both pediatric and adult populations, differences exist in management due to individual age, comorbidities, and differences in disease natural history between children and adults. Pediatric Cardiac Imaging Appropriate Clinical Evaluation Prior to considering advanced imaging (CT, MR, Nuclear Medicine) or echocardiogram, a pertinent clinical evaluation should be performed, including the following (both): oA detailed history, physical examination or meaningful technological contact (telehealth visit, telephone call, electronic mail or messaging) oA review of appropriate diagnostic studies (laboratory, EKG, echo, and other diagnostic imaging) A recent clinical evaluation is not needed prior to advanced imaging (CT, MR, Nuclear Medicine) or echocardiogram if any of the following apply: oIndividual is undergoing guideline-supported scheduled imaging evaluation oEchocardiogram is being performed at the first cardiology visit for an appropriate indication as stated in these guidelines oRoutine imaging is anticipated at the next visit (e.g., one year follow-up echo for a 10 year old with a VSD) Advanced imaging of the heart and echocardiogram are medically necessary in any of the following: oIndividuals who have documented active clinical signs or symptoms of disease involving the heart oAs follow-up for findings on echocardiograms. oSee Initial Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) Indications (PEDCD-8.2) for indications for initial echos in asymptomatic individuals Repeat imaging studies of the heart are not medically necessary unless one of the following applies: oRepeat imaging is indicated in a specific guideline section oThere is evidence for progression of disease oThere is new onset of disease with documentation of how repeat imaging will affect individual management or treatment decisions Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCPediatric Cardiac Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 oSee Repeat Transthoracic Echocardiography Indications for indications for repeat echos in asymptomatic individuals Asymptomatic individuals with exposure to cardiotoxic drugs can have serial echocardiograms as per Cardiotoxicity and Echocardiography (PEDONC-19.2) in the Pediatric Oncology Imaging Guideline Advanced imaging and echocardiogram is not indicated, in the absence of other appropriate indications listed in these guidelines, for any of the following: oIndividuals starting ADHD medications oTo screen asymptomatic individuals for disorders involving the heart Pediatric Cardiac Imaging Modality General Considerations MRI oMRI and MRA studies are frequently indicated for evaluation of congenital heart defects not well visualized on echocardiography, thoracic arteries and veins not visualized on echocardiography, cardiomyopathies, and right ventricular disease, as well as in follow-up for these indications. oDue to the length of time for image acquisition and the need for the individual to be motionless during the acquisition, anesthesia is required for almost all infants and young children (age <7 years), as well as older children with delays in development or maturity. In this population, MRI imaging sessions should be planned with a goal of avoiding a short-interval repeat anesthesia exposure due to insufficient information using the following considerations: MRI is typically performed without and with contrast. If multiple body areas are supported by eviCore guidelines for the clinical condition being evaluated, MRI of all necessary body areas should be obtained concurrently in the same anesthesia session. CT oCT is primarily used to evaluate the coronary and great vessels in congenital heart disease if cardiac MR is contraindicated. oCoding considerations are listed in CT Heart and Coronary Tomography Angiography (CCTA) - Other Indications (PEDCD-10) Ultrasound oEchocardiography is the primary modality used to evaluate the anatomy and function of the pediatric heart, and is generally indicated before considering other imaging modalities. oCoding considerations are listed in Echocardiography - Other Indications (PEDCD-8) Nuclear Medicine Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCPediatric Cardiac Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 oSPECT, PET stress may be indicated for individuals with anomalous CA, angina chest pain, and follow-up for Kawasaki and MIS-C. See specific sections for those indications. oMulti rarely performed in pediatrics, but can be approved for the following: Certain pediatric oncology individuals when echocardiography is insufficient: See: Appropriate Clinical Evaluations (PEDONC-1.2) for imaging guidelines. Quantitation of left ventricular function when recent echocardiogram shows ejection fraction of <50% and MUGA results will impact acute patient care decisions. oSPECT/CT fusion imaging involves SPECT (MPI) imaging and CT for optimizing location, accuracy, and attenuation correction combines functional and anatomic information. There is currently no evidence-based data to formulate appropriateness criteria for SPECT/CT fusion imaging. Combined use of nuclear imaging, including SPECT, along with diagnostic CT (fused SPECT/CT) is considered investigational. oCentral C-V Hemodynamics (CPT\u00ae 78414) is not an imaging study is an outdated examination oCardiac Shunt Detection (CPT\u00ae 78428) is rarely performed in pediatrics but can be approved for individuals in whom Cardiac MR is not diagnostic Calculation of left and right ventricular ejection fractions Assessment of wall motion Quantitation of right to left shunts oMyocardial the myocardium, Myocardial Tc-99m Pyrophosphate Imaging, was used to identify recent infarction, hence, the term \"infarct-avid scan.\" Although still available, the sensitivity and specificity for identifying infarcted myocardial tissue is variable and the current use for this indication is limited CPT\u00ae Acquisition) - Blood Pool ImagingCPT\u00ae Myocardial Imaging, infarct avid, planar, qualitative or quantitative78466 Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Individuals may be diagnosed any time spanning prenatal evaluation to adolescence. For individuals over 18 years of age, see Adult Congenital Heart Disease (CD-11) in the Cardiac Imaging Guidelines. There are a number of variables that influence the modality and timing of imaging individuals with congenital heart disease, which results in a high degree of individuality in determining the schedule for imaging these individuals, including: oGestational age oIndividual's age oPhysiologic effects of the defect oStatus of interventions (catheterization and surgical) oRate of individual's growth oStability of the defect on serial imaging oComorbid conditions oActivity level Age definitions for pediatric individuals (for purpose of these guidelines) oInfant 0-12 months Subcategory of child: Adolescent 11-18 years o\"Children\" refers to all pediatric individuals ages 0-18 years Newborns (neonates) have special considerations as they have potentially rapidly changing physiology oNewborns with any concerns for ductal dependent lesion can have echocardiograms at any frequency oNewborns have changes in pulmonary vascular resistance that can affect clinical status rapidly, and may require more frequent imaging. oNeonatal physiology can extend to the first couple of months of life. oNewborns can have one repeat echo, if prior echocardiogram is abnormal or equivocal (either in the hospital or as newborn outpatient) Individuals can have an echocardiogram at that time for Change in clinical status and/or new concerning signs or symptoms . This can include: oShortness of breath Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCPediatric Cardiac Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 oFatigue oChest oCHF signs on exam oChange in EKG, Pulse ox, laboratory values. An additional study can be approved prior to the next routine interval, to assess for more rapid change, if the change in clinical status involves the echocardiogram itself, such as: oIncreasing function oChange in ductal status, In individuals that can have both Cardiac MR or Cardiac CT and/or MRA Chest or CTA Chest, this is abbreviated as CMR/CT-CMRA/CTA Individuals with medication adjustments may require additional imaging at that time. oPediatric dosing tends to be mg/kg or mcg/kg. Adjusting the dose to the same mg/kg would not be considering a dosing change for imaging. oBecause does adjustments are done by weight, and infants are growing rapidly, they can have changing physiology, pulmonary vascular resistant, ductal size and weight changes, dose response and may require more than one echo during a medication adjustment. Heart surgery oOne month prior to heart surgery, individuals can have TTE (depending on lesion can also include MR/CT Cardiac and/or Chest) oCan have an echocardiogram within one month post-operative oCardiac MRI/CCT if prior echo is equivocal MRA/CTA Chest can be performed if prior echo is equivocal and there are issues regarding aortic arch or pulmonary arteries or veins In individuals who have a documented equivocal echocardiogram due to a technical factor (i.e., poor acoustic windows due to body habitus) which will likely be present on subsequent echocardiograms, a Cardiac MR/CT, or MRA/CTA Chest, may be done with the frequency of echoes, if done instead of an echo.

Cardiac MRI either without contrast (CPT\u00ae 75557) or without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 75561) is indicated, when a recent echocardiogram is inconclusive, needs confirmation of findings, or does not completely define the disease (for subsequent follow-up studies, a recent echocardiogram is not a requirement): oCPT\u00ae 75565 is also indicated for individuals with valvular disease or a need to evaluate intracardiac blood flow. These individuals will usually have CPT\u00ae 93320 and CPT\u00ae 93325 performed with their echocardiography studies. Chest (CPT\u00ae 71555) may be added if the aorta or pulmonary artery needs to be visualized beyond the root, or if aortopulmonary collaterals, pulmonary veins, or systemic veins need to be visualized.

Coronary arteries may arise from the wrong coronary artery cusp leading to ischemic changes during exercise. These lesions may be found incidentally during a murmur evaluation. Anomalous coronary arteries may be seen on echocardiogram during an evaluation for chest pain or syncope or palpitations. In addition, individuals with no echocardiographic findings, but symptoms concerning for angina chest pain may require stress testing. oIndividuals who have positive echocardiographic findings, regardless of symptoms, and individuals who have classical typical angina chest pain regardless of echocardiographic findings, may require treadmill stress testing, stress imaging, of advanced imaging such as Cardiac MRI, Stress echocardiogram, PET, Cardiac CT, and/or cardiac catheterization. Congenital coronary anomalies include abnormal origin of a coronary artery from the PA, anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery from a different aortic sinus of Valsalva (left coronary artery from the right sinus of Valsalva or right coronary artery from the left sinus of Valsalva), coronary arteriovenous fistula, and coronary artery ostial atresia, all in the setting of normal conotruncal anatomy. oAny surgical status Prior to planned surgery, or change in clinical status and/or new concerning signs or symptoms TTE CMR or CCT Can initially include MRA/CTA Chest. If the origin of the coronaries arteries is below the sinus of valsavla then a chest study is not needed on subsequent imaging.

Some children develop a severe inflammatory disease that can present in a similar way to Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome. This syndrome has been defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). These guidelines are intended for use in the outpatient management of cardiac findings of MIS-C. Additional information can be found in PEDHD-12.7 for the outpatient management of head imaging. MIS-C Indications for Cardiac Imaging (PEDCD-12.2) MIS-C Initial Cardiac Imaging (PEDCD-12.2.1) When there is concern for MIS-C, as in atypical or incomplete Kawasaki (see Kawasaki Disease - Acute Phase (PEDCD-6.2) ) echo (TTE) can be approved A cardiac MRI can be approved at the time of diagnosis when there are issues that can affect treatment management not answered by other testing Cardiac CCTA can be done if there is incomplete visualization of the coronary arteries Repeat echocardiograms may be required and approved if either: oTreatment decisions will be affected by results (e.g., treating with IVIg) oThere are new signs or symptoms MIS-C Repeat Cardiac Imaging (PEDCD-12.2.2) The following imaging guidelines reference outpatient management of individuals who have been discharged from the hospital after stability for MIS-C has been established. An echo (TTE) can be approved at the time of presentation and followed by serial echos (TTE) until stabilization has been achieved for any of the following: oNew cardiac signs, symptoms, or findings oEvidence of recurrence of MIS-C oChanges in medication Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCPediatric Cardiac Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 Serial echos can be approved based on the ordering cardiologist's discretion or the treating medical provider in consultation with a cardiologist when there is documented cardiac dysfunction. Individuals who are discharged from the hospital after MIS-C and have stable findings can have an echo (TTE): oWithin 1 week of discharge o4 weeks post discharge oAt 6 months post discharge oOne year post discharge Cardiac CCTA can be done if there is incomplete visualization of the coronary arteries A routine cardiac MRI can be done once after 3 months in an individual with evidence of cardiac involvement (e.g., symptoms, EKG, labs, or echocardiogram) Individuals with changes, or unanswered questions, on echo (TTE) may have a Cardiac MRI based on CD 5.2 in the cardiac imaging guidelines Individuals with dilated coronary arteries can have imaging based on the AHA Kawasaki guidelines.

The thinner chest wall in children allows clearer auscultation of blood flowing through the chambers of the heart, which may result in a murmur on physical exam. The majority of murmurs are innocent and do not require further evaluation. More than 30% of children may have an innocent murmur detected during physical examination. Innocent murmurs are typically systolic ejection murmurs with a vibratory or musical quality, and generally change in quality when the individual changes position. Other types of murmurs can be pathologic and require additional evaluation, usually by a pediatric cardiologist. Echocardiography is indicated, and is performed as part of the office visit. When evaluating an individual with a murmur for the first time, it will not be known whether the individual has congenital heart disease or not. The cardiologist only submits charges for the procedure actually performed. The following echocardiography code combinations should be approved for evaluation of any pathologic murmur or any innocent murmur with 93306 and should not be approved separately. Repeat echocardiography is not indicated if the initial echocardiogram was normal and the murmur has not changed in quality. References 1. Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, 20th Edition, Robert M.

It is an acute febrile illness characterized by a medium vessel vasculitis, which predominantly affects the coronary arteries. oIndividuals who do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for classic KD may be considered to have incomplete (atypical) KD. oIf Kawasaki disease is strongly suspected, treatment will often begin even before cardiac evaluation, since early treatment is associated with a lower risk for coronary aneurysm development. Echocardiography (CPT\u00ae 93306) is indicated for initial assessment for suspected or known Kawasaki disease oCoronary CTA (CPT\u00ae 75574), Cardiac MRI without contrast (CPT\u00ae 75557), Cardiac MRI without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 75561), or MRA Chest (CPT\u00ae 71555) are indicated for evaluation of inconclusive echocardiogram findings, or significant coronary artery abnormalities. oScreening of other body areas for aneurysms is not routinely indicated in Kawasaki disease, but MRA or CTA (contrast as requested) of the affected body area can be approved for evaluation of signs or symptoms suggesting aneurysm development. oSee acute and chronic phase for imaging Kawasaki Disease - Acute Phase (PEDCD-6.2) The acute phase of Kawasaki disease (KD) can last up to 4-6 weeks from the onset of fever until acute systemic inflammation has resolved and coronary artery dimensions are no longer expanding Based on AHA recommendations, the following classifications are used in risk stratification of coronary artery abnormalities oZ-Score classification accounts for the effects of body size and age through use of baseline coronary dimensions adjusted for body surface area. The Z score value represents the number of standard deviation above the mean. (e.g., z=0 pt. has coronary artery dimension value equal to mean, z=2 person has value 2 standard deviation above the mean, based on age, gender, BSA). oCoronary Artery Abnormalities Risk Classification based on Z-Score: 1 - No involvement at any time point (Z score always <2) 2 - Dilation only (Z score 2 to <2.5) 3 - Small aneurysm (Z score 2.5 to <5) 3.1 - Current or persistent Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Transesophageal echocardiography, invasive angiography, CMRI, and CTA can be of value in the assessment of selected individuals but are not routinely indicated for diagnosis and management of the acute illness. oInvasive angiography is rarely performed during the acute illness. oTransesophageal echocardiography, CTA, and CMRI can be useful for the evaluation of older children and adolescents when both: Visualization of the coronary arteries with Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is inadequate and Results will impact immediate management decisions. Evaluation of potential aneurysmal involvement in other arterial beds can be assessed with CMRI, CTA, and, rarely, invasive angiography after recovery from the acute illness for individuals with severe coronary artery involvement or symptoms or signs, such as the presence of a pulsatile axillary mass. Atypical or incomplete Kawasaki. Echo is indicated when atypical KD is being considered, may require repeat echocardiograms if treatment decisions will be affected by results (e.g., treating with IVIg), if new signs or symptoms (such as typical peeling) develop. Kawasaki Disease - Chronic Phase (PEDCD-6.3) Long-term management begins at the end of the acute illness, usually at 4 to 6 weeks after fever onset. Management is based on two pieces of data: oThe dimensions of the largest Aneurysm at any point during the disease oThe dimensions of the largest current aneurysm Additional risk factors that may be considered for imaging oGreater length and distal location of aneurysms that increase the risk of flow stasis oGreater total number of aneurysms oGreater number of branches affected oPresence of luminal irregularities oAbnormal characterization of the vessel wall (calcification, luminal myofibroblastic proliferation) oPresence of functional abnormalities (impaired vasodilation, impaired flow reserve) Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

In cases of extreme obesity (BMI40-50) where the 4-chamber view is inadequately documented after 2 separate ultrasound visits with MFM, fetal echo can be performed. With positive SSA/SSB antibodies, the most vulnerable period for the fetus is during the period from 18 to 24 weeks gestation. Normal sinus rhythm can progress to complete block in seven days during this high-risk period. New onset of heart block is less likely during the 26th through the 30th week, and it rarely develops after 30 weeks of pregnancy. Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

A meaningful technological contact (telehealth visit, telephone call, electronic mail or messaging) since the onset or change in symptoms can serve as a pertinent clinical evaluation. Unless otherwise stated in a specific guideline section, the use of advanced imaging to screen asymptomatic individual s for disorders involving the chest is not supported. Advanced imaging of the chest is only supported in individual s who have documented active clinical signs or symptoms of disease involving the chest. Unless otherwise stated in a specific guideline section, repeat imaging studies of the chest are not necessary unless there is evidence for progression of disease, new onset of disease, and/or documentation of how repeat imaging will affect individual management or treatment decisions Pediatric Chest Imaging Age Considerations ( PEDCH -1.1) Many conditions affecting the chest in the pediatric population are different diagnoses than those occurring in the adult population. For those diseases which occur in both pediatric and adult populations, differences may exist in management due to individual age, comorbidities, and differences in disease natural history between children and adults. Individual s who are 18 years old or younger 20 should be imaged according to the Pediatric Chest Imaging Guidelines if discussed. Any conditions not specifically discussed in the Pediatric Chest Imaging Guidelines should be imaged according to the General Chest Imaging Guidelines. Individual s who are > 18 years old should be imaged according to the General Chest Imaging Guidelines, except where directed otherwise by a specific guideline section.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Pediatric Chest Imaging Guidelines Pediatric Chest Imaging Modality General Considerations ( PEDCH - 1.3) MRI MRI Chest is generally performed without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 71552) unless the individual has a documented contraindication to gadolinium or otherwise stated in a specific guideline section. Due to the length of time required for MRI acquisition and the need to minimize individual movement , anesthesia is usually required for almost all infants (except neonate) and young children (age <7 years), as well as older children with delays in development or maturity. This anesthesia may be administered via oral or intravenous routes. In this individual population, MRI sessions should be planned with a goal of minimizing anesthesia exposure by adhering to the following considerations: MRI procedures can be performed without and/or with contrast use as supported by these condition- based guidelines. If intravenous access will already be present for anesthesia administration and there is no contraindication for using contrast, imaging without and with contrast may be appropriate if requested. By doing so, the requesting provider may avoid repetitive anesthesia administration to perform an MRI with contrast if the initial study without contrast is inconclusive. Recent evidence- based li terature demonstrates the potential for gadolinium deposition in various organs including the brain, after the use of MRI contrast. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has noted that there is currently no evidence to suggest that gadolinium retention in the brain is harmful and restricting gadolinium -based contrast agents (GBCAs) use is not warranted at this time. It has been recommended that GBCA use should be limited to circumstances in which additional information provided by the contrast agent is necessary and the necessity of repetitive MRIs with GBCAs should be assessed. If multiple body areas are supported by eviCore guidelines for the clinical condition being evaluated, MRI of all necessary body areas should be obtained concurrently. The presence of surgical hardware or implanted devices may preclude MRI . The selection of best examination may require coordination between the provider and the imaging service. CT CT Chest is generally performed either with contrast (CPT \u00ae 71260) or without contrast (CPT\u00ae 71250). There are no generally accepted pediatric indications for CT Chest without and with contrast (CPT \u00ae 71270). CT should not be used to replace MRI in an attempt to avoid sedation unless listed as a recommended study in a specific guideline section. The selection of best examination may require coordination between the provider and the imaging service.

For those individual s who do require advanced imaging, ultrasound can be very beneficial in selecting the proper modality, body area, image sequences, and contrast level that will provide the most definitive information for the individual . Nuclear Medicine Nuclear medicine studies other than PET/CT are rarely used in evaluation of the pediatric chest. Pulmonary Ventilation- Perfusion Imaging (CPT \u00ae 78582) has been replaced by or CT Chest with contrast (CPT\u00ae 71260) , but are appropriate for evaluation of suspected pulmonary embolism if CT is unavailable. See Pulmonary Embolism (PE) (CH-25 .1) in the Chest Imaging Guidelines . Pulmonary Perfusion Imaging (CPT\u00ae 78580) are generally not appropriate in lieu of CPT\u00ae 78582 for initial evaluation of suspected pulmonary embolism, but is appropriate for follow up of an equivocal or positive recent ventilation -perfusion lung scan (CPT\u00ae 78582) to evaluate for interval change. Pulmonary Ventilation Imaging (CPT\u00ae 78579) are not appropriate in lieu of CPT\u00ae 78582 for evaluation of suspected pulmonary embolism, but is appropriate for additional evaluation of an abnormal perfusion- only scan (CPT\u00ae 78580). Pulmonary split crystal function study (CPT\u00ae 78597 or CPT\u00ae 78598), also known as Quantitative Differential Pulmonary Perfusion, is indicated for preoperative planning of segmental, lobar, or lung resection.

An incidental solitary pulmonary nodule in a child representing a primary lung carcinoma has never been reported in the literature. Similarly, an extrathoracic malignancy presenting with an incidental solitary pulmonary nodule in an otherwise healthy child is very rare. CT Chest with contrast (CPT \u00ae 71260) as a one- time evaluation for a ll children with a pulmonary nodule incidentally discovered on other imaging. Follow up imaging of incidental solitary pulmonary nodules in asymptomatic healthy children is not necessary. 6 Follow up imaging is indicated for the following: Immunocompromised individual s. Malignancy (see below) . Invasive infection. New or worsening pulmonary symptoms . Children with a malignant solid tumor who have pulm onary nodules of any size should have imaging according to the guideline section for the specific cancer type. See Pediatric Oncology Imaging Guidelines for specific imaging indications . This guideline section does not apply to multiple pulmonary nodules, which are imaged according to the underlying disorder in pediatric individual s. Background and Supporting Information A nodule is any pulmonary or pleural lesion that is a discrete, spherical opacity 2- 30 mm in diameter surrounded by normal lung tissue. A larger nodule is called a mass. Entities that are not nodules, and are considered benign, include non- spherical linear, sheet -like, two -dimensional or scarring opacities. References 1.

A meaningful technological contact(telehealth visit, telephone call, electronic mail or messaging) since the onset or change in signs and/or symptoms 29, can serve as a pertinent clinical evaluation . A detailed neurological exam is required prior to advanced imaging except in the following scenarios : Individual is undergoing a guideline- supported scheduled follow -up imaging evaluation Tinnitus, TMJ, Sinus or mastoid disease, ear pain, hearing loss, eye disease, papilledema 30, dental requests and epistaxis. (A relevant physical exam is still required.) The request is from a neurologist, neurosurgeon, endocrinologist, otolaryngologist, or ophthalmologist who has evaluated the individual since onset of symptoms. Unless otherwise stated in a specific guideline section, the use of advanced imagingto screen asymptomatic individual s for disorders involving the head is not supported. Advanced imaging of the head is only indicated in individual s who have documented active clinical signs or symptoms of disease involving the head. Unless otherwis e stated in a specific guideline section, repeat imaging studies of the head are not necessary unless there is evidence for progression of disease, newonset of disease, and/or documentation of how repeat imaging will affect individualmanagement or treatment decisions. Pediatric Head Imaging Age Considerati ons (PEDHD -1.1) Many conditions affecting the head in the pediatric population are differentdiagnoses than those occurring in the adult population. For those diseases whichoccur in both pediatric and adult populations, minor differences may exist inmanagement due to in dividual age, comorbidities, and differences in disease natural history between children and adults. Individual s who are 18 years old or younger 31 and any conditions not specifically discussed in the General Head Imaging Guidelines should be imaged according tothe Pediatric Head Imaging G uidelines . Any conditions not specifically discussed in the Pediatric Head Imaging Guidelines should be imaged according to the General Head Imaging Guidelines . Individual s who are >18 years old should be imaged according to the General Head Imaging G uidelines , except where directed otherwise by a specific guideline section.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, IncClick Here to Return to Main TOC Pediatric Head Imaging Guidelines Pediatric Head Imaging Appropriate Clinical Evaluation (PEDHD -1.2) Reque sts for Studies with Overlapping Fields There are many CPT\u00ae codes for imaging the head that have significantly overlapping fields. In the majority of cases where multiple head CPT\u00ae codes are requested, only one CPT\u00ae code is appropriate unless there is clear documentation of a need for the additional codes to cover all necessary body areas. See General Guidelines - Anatomic Issues ( HD-1.1) in the Head Imaging Guidelines for the correct coding of these studies. Pediatric Head Imaging Modality General Considerations (PEDHD- 1.3) MRI MRI is the preferred modality for imaging the pediatric head unless otherwisestated in a specific guideline section. Due to the length of time required for MRI acquisition and the need to minimize individual movement , anesthesia is usually required for almost all infants ( except neonates ) and young children (age <7 years) as well as older children with delays in development or maturity. This anesthesia may be administered via oral or intravenous routes. In this individual population, MRI sessions should be planned with a goal of minimizing anesthesia exposure by adhering to the following considerations: MRI procedures can be performed without and/or with contrast use as supported by these condition based guidelines. If intravenous access will already be present for anesthesia administration and there is no contraindication for using contrast, imaging without and with contrast may be appropriate if requested. By doing so, the requesting provider may avoid repetitive anesthesia administration to perform an MRI with contrast if the initial study without contrast is inconclusive. Recent evidence based literature demonstrates the potential for gadolinium deposition in various organs including the brain, after the use of MRI contrast. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has noted that t here is currently no evidence to suggest that gadolinium retention in the brain is harmful and restricting gadolinium -based contrast agents (GBCAs) use is not warranted at this time. It has been recommended that GBCA use should be limited to circ umstances in which additional information provided by the contrast agent is necessary and the necessity of repetitive MRIs with GBCAs should be assessed. If multiple body areas are supported by eviCore guidelines for the clinical condition being evaluated, MRI /MRA of all necessary body areas should be obtained concurrently in the same anesthesia session.

Advanced imaging is indicated for children with head trauma with ANY of the following red flags: Loss of consciousness Altered mental status or abnormal behavior Known or suspected skull fracture Glasgow Coma Score <15 Age younger than 2 years Vomiting Severe mechanism of injury Severe or worsening headache Amnesia Nonfrontal scalp hematoma CT Head without contrast (CPT \u00ae 70450) is the primary advanced imaging study in individual s with acute head trauma. CT Maxillofacial without contrast (C PT\u00ae contrast (CPT\u00ae Cervical S pine without contrast (CPT\u00ae 72125) is indicated if there has been associated injury to those structures. MRI Brain without contrast (CPT\u00ae 70551) is indicated for the followi ng: Children with an abnormal neurological exam that is not explained by the CTfindings. Subacute (8 days to one month after initial traumatic event) or chronic blunt headtrauma with new or worsening neurological signs or cognitive symptoms Children suspected of being the victims of physical abuse. See Suspected Physical Child Abuse ( PEDMS-7) in the Pediatric Musculoskeletal Imaging Guidelines . Following a head injury, a repeat CT Head without contrast (CPT\u00ae 70450) or MRI Brain without contrast (CPT\u00ae 70551) is indicated if the child develops fixed or fluctuating diminished mental acuity or alertness, or new abnormalities onneurological examination. Follow- up of known or treated parenchymal subdural or epidural hematoma may require frequent imaging during the initial 8 weeks following injury, and theserequests should generally appropriate.

Acute bacterial sinusitis can be presumptively diagnosed in a child withacute upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms and any of the following: Persistent symptoms lasting >10 days without improvement . Worsening symptoms after initial period of improvement. Severe symptoms including purulent nasal discharge and fever >102.2\u00b0F for atleast 3 consecutive days. Presumed bacterial infections should be treated empirically with appropriateantibiotics. Imaging of any kind cannot distinguish bacterial from viral sinusitis. Imaging Indications in Sinusitis (PEDHD -5.2) Mild mucosal the paranasal sinuses or mastoids is an extremelycommon incidental finding noted on head imaging studies done for other indications.If there are no other abnormalities of facial structures noted, this finding is not anindication for advanced imaging of the sinuses or temporal bone. CT Maxillo facial without contrast (CPT \u00ae 70486) is indicated if ANY of the following is present: No improvement after 10 days of appropriate antibiotic treatment Generally this will be amoxicillin/clavulanate, amoxicillin, cefdinir, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, or ceftri axone . Recurrence of a treated infection within 8 weeks of effective treatment.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCPediatric Head Imaging Guidelines Concern for invasive fungal (CPT\u00ae 70496) is appropriate with these findings as well if there is clinical concern for associated vascular complications including but not limited to mycotic aneurysm or venous sinus thrombosis. Repeat sinus imaging is generally not indicated for individual s who have responded satisfactorily to treatment, but is appropriate with clear documentation of the need for updated CT results to direct acute patient care frequently obtained prior to sinus surgery. The datasetis then loaded into the navigational workstation in the operating room for use duringthe surgical procedure. The information provides exact positioning of surgicalinstruments with regard to the individual 's 3D CT images. In most cases, the preoperative CT is a technical -only service that does not require interpretation by a radiologist. For treatment planning for sinus surgery CPT \u00ae 77011: A stereotactic CT localization scan is frequently obtained prior to sinus surgery. The dataset is then loaded into thenavigational workstation in the operating room for use during the surgical procedure.The imaging facility should report CPT \u00ae 7701 1 when performing a scan not requiring interpretation by a radiologist. If a diagnostic scan is performed and interpreted by a radiologist, the appropriatediagnostic CT code (e.g. CPT \u00ae 70486) should be used. It is not appropriate to report both CPT\u00ae 70486 and CPT\u00ae 77011 for the same CT session. 3D Rendering (CPT\u00ae 76376 or CPT\u00ae 76377) should not be reported in conjunction with CPT\u00ae 77011 (or CPT\u00ae 70486 if used). The procedure inherently generates a 3D dataset. Such operative studies are indicated when ordered by the operating surgeon for thispurpose. Requests for both Head and Sinus Imaging (PEDHD -5.4) CT Head does not visualize all of the sinuses. MRI Brain provides excellent visualization of the sinuses sufficient to recognize sinusitis, and addition of sinus CT for this purpose is unnecessary. In individuals being evaluated for potential sinus surgery, separate CT S inus is often appropriate even after a MRI Brain in order to visualize obstructions to spontaneous mucus flow. See Stereotactic CT Localization (CPT\u00ae 77011) (PEDHD- 5.3). Separate head imaging is not generally indicated in individuals with a normalneurological examination who have headaches associated with sinus symptoms.

An online calculator to determine head circumference percentile is available at: http://www.infantchart.com/cdc0to3headforage.php. Birth to age 6 months: Ultrasound Head (CPT\u00ae 76506) is indicated initially in individual s with an open fontanelle. CT Head without contrast (CPT\u00ae 70450) is indicated if hydrocephalus or hemorrhage is present on ultrasound. MRI Brain without contrast (CPT\u00ae 70551) or without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70553) i s indicated for any abnormality seen on ultrasound. Age 7 months and older, or with closed fontanelle: MRI Brain without contrast (CPT\u00ae 70551) or without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70553) ) i s indicated. CT is generally not indicated in this age group since uncomplicatedhydrocephalus is less likely after early infancy. Microcephaly (PEDHD -7.2) Microcephaly is defined as head circumference that is less than the 5th percentile for age and sex, or head circumference decreasing in percentiles over two visitsestablished by use of measurements and CDC growth charts. An online calculator todetermine head circumference percentile is available at:http://www.infantchart.com/cdc0to3headforage.php. MRI Brain without and with contrast (CPT \u00ae 70553) is indicated for all individual s. CT is generally not recommended as that modality lacks the sensitivity to detectthe relevant anatomical abnormalit ies. Hydrocephalus (PEDHD -7.3) This is the most common identifiable cause of macrocephaly. Almost allhydrocephalus is obstructive, except hydrocephalus due to choroid plexuspapillomas. See Choroid Plexus Tumors ( PEDONC- 4.13) in the Pediatric Oncology Imaging Guidelines for those lesions. Hydrocephalus is traditionally divided into non- communicating (the obstruction lies within the course of the brain's ventricular system) and communicating (theobstruction is distal to the ventricular system). Ventriculom egaly refers to enlarged ventricular spaces. It is often initially found on fetal ultrasound. It can be from an obstructive cause or can be relative secondary tosmall brain volume. It can remain stable and may be monitored with serialultrasound (CPT \u00ae 76506) to assess stability or MRI Brain with and without contrast (CPT\u00ae 70553) if over age 6 months. If ventriculomegaly progresses to hydrocephalus, follow imaging timelines listed below for hydrocephalus.

Craniosynostosis may be caused by a genetic condition, such as Apert, Pfeiffer or Crouzon syndrome to name a few.18 Abnormal head shape is the common clinical feature. Skull x -rays and/or ultrasound should be obtained prior to considering advanced imaging. In cases of very strong consideration of craniosynostosis with surgical planning in progress, x- rays and/or ultrasound are not required. CT Head without contrast (CPT\u00ae 70450) is indicated in the diagnosis of craniosynostosis , with reported sensitivity near 100%.

CT or MRI Perfusion See General Guidelines- Other Imaging Situations (PEDHD- 1.4) Sickle Cell Disease ( PEDHD -12.5) Individual s with sickle cell disease are at significantly increased risk for stroke and silent infarction, beginning at a very young age. Recent advances allow physiciansto identify individual s at high risk for stroke and begin a primary stroke prevention program. Identification of silent cerebral infarction is important because treatment with prophylactic red cell transfusions to maintain hemoglobin S levels at <30% of total hemoglobin may reduce recurrent stroke and extent of neurologic damage. The following imaging is indicated for all sickle cell individual s with a severe phenotype (Hgb SS 93888) for all individual s age 2 to 16.

MRI Spinal Cord without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 72156 and CPT\u00ae 72157) is also indicated for evaluation of pediatric demyelinating disease. MRI Lumbar Spine without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 72158) is not indicated unless the individual has a tethered cord or other anatomic abnormality causing caudal displacement of the filum terminalis. CT imaging is generally not indicated in the evaluation of demyelinating disease. Metabolic (FDG) PET Brain (CPT\u00ae 78608) and MR S pectroscopy (CPT\u00ae 76390) are considered investigational for evaluation of pediatric demyelinating diseases. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) ( PEDHD -14.2) Multiple sclerosis is less common in children. About 4% of MS cases are diagnosedbefore age 18, and only ~0.7% of all MS cases begin before age 10. Ataxia, optic neuritis, diplopia, and transverse myelitis are common presentations.MS can present as an acute encephalitis -like illness, especially in childhood.

MRI Brain (CPT\u00ae (CPT\u00ae 72156 and CPT\u00ae 72157) without and with contrast is indicated every 3 months for 1 year following diagnosis or if ordered out of sequence or beyond one year by a specialist or any provider in consultation with a specialist . MRI Brain (CPT\u00ae 70551) and S pinal Cord (CPT\u00ae 72141 and CPT\u00ae 72146) without contrast can be approved if there is a contraindication to gadolinium. Most individual s will have complete clinical recovery by 12 months, while stable MRI abnorm alities (gliosis) may persist. These findings do not require additional imaging unless the individual develops new neurologic symptoms. Prolonged symptoms or return of symptoms may represent a different demyelinating disorder There are other pediatric demyelinating disorders that are less common but have clinical overlap with multiple sclerosis and ADEM such as (but not limited to): Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) spectrum disorders (See Neuromyelitis Optica secondary to infectious or inflammatory disorders (e.g. transversemyelitis) (See General Guideines - Other Imaging Sitnuations ( HD 1.7 )) Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Individual s with mass lesions should have follow up imaging according to the guidelines for the specific diagnosis. Background and Supporting Information Growth hormone stimulation testing is limited by poor specificity and requires failure on 2 tests to diagnose growth hormone deficiency. Controversy exists as to the cutoff level which differentiates a normal response froma deficient response on provocative testing. Some experts support GH <7 ng/mLhowever many pediatric endocrinologists consider a peak GH level <10 ng/mL to beindicative of growth hormone deficiency and may identify children with partial GHD. Diabetes Insipidus (DI) and Other Disorders of Anti -Diuretic Hormone (PEDHD -15.4) Laboratory testing should be performed initially. serum is caused by synthesis or secretion ofvasopressin in the hypothalamus and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) iscaused by renal resistance to vasopressin. Central Diabetes Insipidus (DI) MRI Brain without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70553) or MRI Brain without contrast (CPT\u00ae 70551) is indicated for newly diagnosed central DI. Individual s with a normal pituitary on initial MRI can have repeat MRI Brain without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70553) every 3-6 months for the first 2 years as germinomas may cause central DI while still too small to detect on imaging. Serial measurement of -hCG is also indicated for these individual s, and MRI should be repeated if a significant rise in -hCG is detected on screening.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, IncClick Here to Return to Main TOC Pediatric Head Imaging Guidelines Central Precocious Puberty (CPP) An LH >0.3 U/L on a random blood sample is the most reliable screening test for central precocious puberty. If LH <0.3 U/L and CPP is suspected, a stimulation testwith a GnRH analog is the gold standard. Neuroimaging should always follow hormonal studies that suggest a central origin ofprecocious puberty. MRI Brain without and with contrast (CPT \u00ae 70553, preferred study) or MRI Brain without contrast (CPT\u00ae 70551) is indicated for evaluation of any child wi th documented central precocious puberty.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, IncClick Here to Return to Main TOC Pediatric Head Imaging Guidelines Background and Supporting Information There is little evidence to support the use of MRA/CTA and PET in the evaluation of movement disorders. Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurological disorder characterized by repetitive, stereotyped, involuntary movements and vocalizations called tics. The firstsymptoms of TS are almost always noticed in childhood. Some of the more common tics include eye blinking and other vision irregularities, facial grimacing, shouldershrugging, and head or shoulder jerking. Perhaps the most dramatic and disablingtics are those that result in self -harm such as punching oneself in the face, or vocal tics including coprolalia (uttering swear words) or echolalia (repeating the words orphrases of others). Many with TS additional neurobehavioral problemsincluding inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, and obsessive- compulsive and repetitive behaviors.

A meaningful technological contact (telehealth visit, telephone call, electronic mail or messaging) can serve as a pertinent clinical evaluation. Plain x-ray should be done prior to advanced imaging. The results of plain x-rays performed after the current episode of symptoms started or changed need to be available to the requesting provider of the advanced imaging study. X-ray can rule out those situations that do not require advanced imaging, such as acute/healing fracture, osteomyelitis, and tumors of bone amenable to biopsy or radiation therapy (in known metastatic disease), etc. oEven in soft tissue masses, plain x-rays are helpful in evaluating for calcium/bony deposits, e.g. myositis ossificans and invasion of bone. Unless otherwise stated in a specific guideline section, repeat imaging studies of the same body area are not necessary unless there is evidence for progression of disease, new onset of disease, and/or documentation of how repeat imaging will affect individual management or treatment decisions. Provider-directed conservative care may include any or all of the following: R.I.C.E (rest, ice, compression, and elevation), NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and non-narcotic corticosteroids, viscosupplementation injections, a provider-directed home exercise program, cross-training, physical medicine, or immobilization by splinting/casting/bracing. These guidelines are based upon using advanced imaging to answer specific clinical questions that will affect patient management. Imaging is not indicated if the results will not affect individual management decisions. Standard medical practice would dictate continuing conservative therapy prior to advanced imaging in individuals who are improving on current treatment programs.

For those diseases which occur in both pediatric and adult populations, differences may exist in management due to individual age, comorbidities, and differences in disease natural history between children and adults. Individuals who are <18 years old should be imaged according to the Pediatric Musculoskeletal Imaging Guidelines if discussed. Any conditions not specifically discussed in the Pediatric Musculoskeletal Imaging Guidelines should be imaged according to the General Musculoskeletal Imaging Guidelines.

This anesthesia may be administered via oral or intravenous route. In this individual population, MRI sessions should be planned with a goal of minimizing anesthesia exposure by adhering to the following considerations: MRI procedures can be performed without and/or with contrast use as supported by these condition based guidelines. If intravenous access will already be present for anesthesia administration and there is no contraindication for using contrast, imaging without and with contrast may be appropriate if requested. By doing so, the requesting provider may avoid repetitive anesthesia administration to perform an MRI with contrast if the initial study without contrast is inconclusive. Recent evidence based literature demonstrates the potential for gadolinium deposition in various organs including the brain, after the use of MRI contrast. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has noted that there is currently no evidence to suggest that gadolinium retention in the brain is harmful and restricting gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) use is not warranted at this time. It has been recommended that GBCA use should be limited to circumstances in which additional information provided by the contrast agent is necessary and the necessity of repetitive MRIs with GBCAs should be assessed. If multiple body areas are supported by eviCore guidelines for the clinical condition being evaluated, MRI of all necessary body areas should be obtained concurrently in the same imaging session.

Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCPediatric Musculoskeletal Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 oThe presence of surgical hardware or implanted devices may preclude MRI, as magnetic field distortion may limit detail in adjacent structures. CT may be the procedure of choice in these cases. oThe selection of best examination may require coordination between the provider and the imaging service. CT oCT without contrast is generally superior to MRI for imaging bone and joint anatomy; thus it is useful for studying complex fractures (particularly of the joints, dislocations, and assessing delayed union or non-union of fractures, integration of bone graft material, if plain x-rays are equivocal. CT should not be used to replace MRI in an attempt to avoid sedation unless listed as a recommended study in a specific guideline section. oCT beam attenuation can result in streak artifact which can obscure adjacent details. This can occur with radiopaque material such as metal objects or dense bones. oThe selection of best examination may require coordination between the requesting provider and the rendering imaging facility. Ultrasound oUltrasound is frequently used to evaluate infants for hip dysplasia, to detect and/ or aspirate joint effusion, and as an initial evaluation of extremity soft tissue masses. oCPT\u00ae codes vary by body area and the use of Doppler imaging. These CPT\u00ae codes are included in the table at the beginning of this guideline. Nuclear Medicine oNuclear medicine studies are commonly used in evaluation of the peripheral musculoskeletal system, and other rare indications exist as well: Bone (CPT\u00ae for evaluation of suspected loosening of orthopedic prostheses when recent plain x-ray is nondiagnostic. Nuclear detection of ischemic or infarcted regions in sickle cell disease. Triple phase bone scan (CPT\u00ae 78315) is indicated for evaluation of complex regional pain syndrome or reflex sympathetic dystrophy. 3D Rendering o3D Rendering indications in pediatric musculoskeletal imaging are identical to those in the general imaging guidelines.

DDH includes a spectrum of abnormalities including abnormal acetabular shape (dysplasia) and malposition of the femoral head ranging from mild subluxation, dislocatable hip to fixed dislocation. 60 to 80% of abnormalities are identified by physical exam, and more than 90% are identified by ultrasound. Treatment may involve placement in a Pavlik harness, casting, or surgery in extreme or refractory cases. Screening studies The routine use of ultrasound in screening neonates and infants without risk factors for DDH is not recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. There are two sonographic methods of evaluating the hip: the dynamic stress (Harcke) technique and the static (Graf) technique Screening ultrasound (CPT\u00ae 76885 or CPT\u00ae 76886) is recommended for infants between 4 weeks of age and 4 months of age with one or more of the following risk factors: oBreech presentation oFamily history of DDH oAbnormal hip exam (e.g. positive Ortolani or Barlow maneuvers, asymmetric thigh folds, shortening of the thigh observed on the dislocated side, limitation of hip abduction). For children between 4 and 6 months of age plain x-ray is the preferred imaging modality as femoral head ossification is often seen on x-ray in normal patients oIf x-ray is inconclusive, ultrasound (CPT\u00ae 76885 or CPT\u00ae 76886) may be indicated 76885 or CPT\u00ae 76886): oType IIA hip was diagnosed on a previous hip ultrasound using the Graf method and follow-up hip ultrasound is requested to confirm normal development. oGraf type IIA hip has an alpha angle (bony angle) between 50 to 59 degrees in a child less than 3 months of age. oThe overwhelming majority of these hips mature spontaneously, but follow-up may be required to ensure that maturation has occurred. oFull description of the Graf classification can be found at: http://radiopaedia.org/ articles/ultrasound-classification-of-developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-1. Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCPediatric Musculoskeletal Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 oSubluxation or dislocation was diagnosed on previous hip ultrasound using the dynamic Harke imaging method. oPrior ultrasound demonstrates abnormal hip and treatment has been applied, such as a Pavlik harness or other device. Follow-up ultrasound is indicated to document effectiveness of treatment, to ensure the femoral head remains located in the acetabulum or to identify treatment failure. The usual interval for follow-up sonography is monthly, but earlier imaging is indicated for clinical suspicion of treatment failure, subluxation or dislocation of the hip. MRI without contrast (CPT\u00ae 73721) or CT without contrast (CPT\u00ae 73700) is indicated to evaluate alignment following reduction. Children in casts or following surgery may require repeated advanced imaging to ensure the reduction remains satisfactory, or to assess incorporation of bone graft material. Hip ultrasound is NOT indicated for the following: oInfants less than 2 weeks of age, since hip laxity is normal after birth and usually resolves spontaneously. oInfants older than 6 months of age as plain x-ray of the hips become more reliable due to femoral head ossification and should be used in infants over 6 months of age. oType I, IIB, IIC, IID, and III hips diagnosed on a previous hip ultrasound using the Graf method. Type I hip is normal, and Type IIB, IIC, IID, and III require referral for treatment rather than follow-up imaging. oPlain x-ray of the hips should be performed rather than ultrasound if there is a clinical suspicion for teratogenic dysplasia.

Every effort should be made to support reasonable requests for imaging in these children. Child abuse injuries may affect any organ or system. Fractures are common, but injuries may also involve solid and hollow visceral organs, and/or superficial and deep soft tissue injuries. Some fracture patterns are highly correlated with non-accidental mechanisms, such as the \"classic metaphyseal lesion,\" also known as a corner fracture or bucket handle fracture, but fractures may occur in any bone. Unsuspected fractures, multiple fractures at various stages of healing, or fractures of a configuration or distribution inconsistent with the history provided, may raise the suspicion for physical abuse. Skeletal Injury The radiographic skeletal survey is the primary imaging procedure for detecting fractures, especially in children age 24 months or younger. In older children, skeletal survey may be indicated, but more tailored radiographic evaluation based on history and physical examination may be preferable to skeletal survey. When skeletal survey is negative, but clinical suspicion remains 78803) Suspected injury to the spine should usually first be evaluated with plain radiographs. CT without contrast and/or MRI without contrast or without and with contrast may be required for complete evaluation of osseous and soft tissue spine injuries. If requested for suspected or known physical abuse, both CT without contrast and/or MRI without contrast or without and with contrast of suspected sites should be approved. A repeat skeletal survey performed approximately 2 weeks after the initial examination can provide additional information on the presence and age of child abuse fractures and should be performed when abnormal or equivocal findings are found on the initial study and when abuse is suspected on clinical grounds Head Injury CT Head without contrast (CPT\u00ae 70450) is indicated when there is clinical evidence of head injury or when skull fracture of any age is detected on survey skull x-ray.7 oCT Head without contrast (CPT\u00ae 70450) is also indicated when known or suspected cervical trauma is present in a pediatric individual. Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCPediatric Musculoskeletal Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 oCT Head without contrast (CPT\u00ae 70450) is indicated in individuals less than 1 year of age, even if no neurologic symptoms are detected due to the great potential morbidity of abuse head trauma. oCT Cervical Spine without contrast (CPT\u00ae 72125) and/or MRI Cervical Spine without contrast (CPT\u00ae 72141) or without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 72156) may be approved when there is clinical evidence of head injury or when skull fracture of any age is detected on survey skull x-ray. MRI Brain without contrast (CPT\u00ae 70551) or without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70553) is indicated to further evaluate brain parenchymal injury, or in a child where the clinical signs of brain injury are not sufficiently explained by CT findings. Other Body Area Injuries CT should be performed with contrast unless an absolute contraindication exists. ANY of the following imaging studies are indicated for suspected injury to the abdomen or pelvis6,7: oAbdominal ultrasound (CPT\u00ae 76700) Pelvis with contrast (CPT\u00ae 72193) oCT Abdomen and Pelvis with contrast (CPT\u00ae 74177) ANY of the following imaging studies are indicated for suspected injury to the chest: oCT Chest without contrast (CPT\u00ae 71250) oCT Chest with contrast (CPT\u00ae 71260) Screening of other children A skeletal survey, or other imaging, may be requested for siblings of abused children, or for other household members under the age of two due to the high incidence of occult fractures in these children.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Pediatric Neck Imaging Guidelines General Guidelines (PEDNECK -1.0) A pertinent clinical evaluation including a detailed history, physical examination, since the onset or change in symptoms , and appropriate laboratory studies should be performed prior to considering advanced imaging (CT, MR I, Nuclear Medicine), unless the individual is undergoing guideline -supported scheduled follow -up imaging evaluation. A meaningful technological contact (telehealth visit, telephone call, electronic mail or messaging) since the onset or change in symptoms can serve as a pertinent clinical evaluation. Unless otherwise stated in a specific guideline section, the use of advanced imaging to screen asymptomatic individual s for disorders involving the neck is not supported. Advanced imaging of the neck is only supported in individual s who have documented active clinical signs or symptoms of disease involving the neck. Unless otherwise stated in a specific guideline section, repeat imaging studies of the neck are not necessary unless there is evidence for progression of disease, new onset of disease, and/or documentation of how repeat imaging will affect individual management or treatment decisions. Age Considerations (PEDNECK -1.1) Many conditions affecting the neck in the pediatric population are different diagnoses than those occurring in the adult population. For those diseases which occur in both pediatri c and adult populations, minor differences may exist in management due to individual age, comorbidities, and differences in disease natural history between children and adults. Individual s who are 18 years old or younger 13 should be imaged according to the Pediatric Neck Imaging Guidelines if discussed. Any conditions not specifically discussed in the Pediatric Neck Imaging Guidelines should be imaged according to the General Neck Imaging Guidelines. Individual s who are > 18 years old should be imaged according to the General Neck Imaging Guidelines, except where directed otherwise by a specific guideline section. Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Pediatric Neck Imaging Guidelines Modality General Considerations (PEDNECK -1.3) MRI MRI Neck is generally performed without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70543) unless the individual has a documented contraindication to gadolinium or otherwise stated in a specific guideline section. Due to the length of time required for MRI acquisition and the need to minimize individual movement, anesthesia is usually required for almost all infants (except neonates) and young children (age <7 years) as well as older children with delays in development or maturity. This anesthesia may be administered via oral or intravenous routes. In this individual population, MRI sessions should be planned with a goal of minimizing anesthesia exposure by adhering to the following considerations: MRI procedures can be performed without and/or with contrast use as supported by these condition based guidelines. If intravenous access will already be present for anesthesia administration and there is no contraindication for using contrast, imaging without and with cont rast may avoid repetitive anesthesia administration to perform an MRI with contrast if the initial study without contrast is inconclusive. Recent evidence based literature demonstrates the potential for gadolinium deposition in various organs including the brain, after the use of MRI contrast. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has noted that there is currently no evidence to suggest that gadolinium retention in the brain is harmful and restricting gadolinium -based contrast agents (GBCAs) use is not warranted at this time. It has been recommended that GBCA use should be limited to circumstances in which additional information provided by the contrast agent is necessary and the necessity of repetitive MRIs with GBCAs should be assessed. If multiple b ody areas are supported by eviCore guidelines for the clinical condition being evaluated, MRI of all necessary body areas should be obtained concurrently in the same anesthesia session. The presence of surgical hardware or implanted devices may preclude MR I. The selection of best examination may require coordination between the provider and the imaging service. CT CT Neck typically extends from the base of the skull to the upper thorax. A separate CPT \u00ae code for head imaging in order to visualize the skull base is not necessary. In some cases, especially in follow -up of a known finding, it may be appropriate to limit the exam to the region of concern to reduce radiation exposure. Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Pediatric Neck Imaging Guidelines CT Neck is generally performed with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70491) unless the individua l has a documented contraindication to CT contrast or otherwise stated in a specific guideline section. CT Neck may be indicated for further evaluation of abnormalities suggested on prior US or MRI Procedures. In general, CT Neck is appropriate when evaluating trauma, malignancy, and for preoperative planning. CTA Neck (CPT \u00ae 70498) is indicated for evaluation of the vessels of the neck, especially with concern for dissection. CT should not be used to replace MRI in an attempt to avoid sedation unless listed as a recommended study in a specific guideline section. The selection of best examination may require coordination between the provider and the imaging service. Ultrasound Ultrasound soft tissues of the neck (CPT \u00ae 76536) is indicated as an initial study for evaluating adenopathy, other palpable mass or swelling, thyroid, parathyroid, parotid and other salivary glands, and cysts. For those individual s who do require additional advanced imaging after ultrasound, ultrasound can be very beneficial in selecting the proper modality, body area, image sequences, and contrast level that will provide the most definitive information for the individual . Nuclear Medicine Nuclear medicine studies of the neck in pediatric individual s are most commonly used to evaluate neck masses, or thyroid and parathyroid disease following initial studies with anatomic imaging, such as ultrasound, CT, or MRI. See Neck Masses (Pediatric) (PEDNECK -2) and Thyroid and Parathyroid (PEDNECK- 6) for imaging guidelines. Salivary Gland CPT\u00ae 78230, following: Evaluation of salivary gland function in individual s with dry mouth (xerostomia) and ONE of the following: Sj\u00f6gren syndrome Sialadenitis History of head or neck radiation therapy 3D Rendering 3D Rendering indications in pediatric neck imaging are identical to those in the general imaging guidelines. See 3D Rendering ( Preface- 4.1) in the Preface Imaging Guidelines. The guidelines listed in this section for certain specific indications are not intended to be all-inclusive; clinical judgment remains paramount and variance from these guidelines may be appropriate and warranted for specific clinical situations.

The individual 's age and knowledge of the anatomy and common lesions of the neck are very important in narrowing the differential diagnosis. Ultrasound Neck ( CPT\u00ae 76536) is indicated as the initial imaging study of choice. Ultrasound helps define the size and extent of localized superficial masses and helps confirm whether they are cystic or solid. Color Doppler ultrasound (CPT\u00ae 93880 bilateral study or carotid arteries or CPT\u00ae 93882 unilateral study) can evaluat e the vasculature. MRI Neck without contrast (CPT\u00ae 70540) or without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70543) , or CT Neck with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70491) is supported if ultrasound is inconclusive or to further characterize abnormalities seen on ultrasound. Cervical lymphadenitis is common in children and follows most viral or bacterial infections of the ears, nose, and throat. No advanced imaging is necessary with uncomplicated lymph node enlargement. When lymphadenopathy persists for more than 4 weeks of treatment or there is suspicion of complications, such as abscess formation, ultrasound is indicated, See Cervical Lymphadenopath y (PEDNECK- 3). Congenital cervical cysts frequently present in and with contrast (CPT \u00ae 70543) or CT Neck with contrast (CPT\u00ae indicated for diagnosis of fourth branchial cleft cysts. Ultrasound is indicated for initial evaluation of a suspected cystic neck mass. MRI Neck without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70543) or CT Neck with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70491) indicated CPT\u00ae 78232) is indicated for of parotid masses to allow preoperative diagnosis of Warthin's tumor.

If there is improvement with conservative treatment, advanced imaging is not indicated. Ultrasound (CPT\u00ae 76536) is indicated without 4 weeks of treatment and observation if there is unexplained fever with a temperature 100.4 \u00b0F and there is clinical concern for suppurative lymphadenopathy 76536) is indicated as an initial evaluation if lymphadenopathy persists following 4 weeks of treatment and/or observation. MRI Neck without contrast (CPT\u00ae 70540) or without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70543) or CT Neck with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70491) if ultrasound is inconclusive or to further characterize abnormalities seen on ultrasound. Both are superior to ultrasound for defining the relationship of an abscess to adjacent structures, particularly the airway; and detecting posterior cervical, mediastinal and intracranial extension. If systemic symptoms or other clinical findings suggest malignancy, See Pediatric Lymphomas ( PEDONC-5) in the Pediatric Oncology Imaging Guidelines . Background and Supporting Information Inflammato ry lymph nodes from acute lymphadenitis are usually painful, tender and mobile, frequently associated with upper respiratory infection, pharyngitis or dental infection. Occasionally, sarcoidosis or toxoplasmosis and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can cause inflammatory lymphadenopathy as well. References 1. Ludwig BJ, Wang J, Nadgir RN, et al.

Individual s usually present by 2 weeks of life with an anterior neck mass, which is commonly right sided (75% of cases). A history of a traumatic breech or forceps delivery is common. If Ultrasound is Positive No further imaging is needed since diagnosis is defined. CT Neck with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70491) or MRI Neck without contrast (CPT\u00ae 70540) or without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70543) to evaluate for other structural causes if ultrasound is negative. Children and Adults (Acquired Torticollis) Injury or inflammation involving the sternocleidomastoid or trapezius muscles is the most common cause of acquired torticollis in children. Plain radiographs of the cervical spine should be obtained as an initial evaluation i f there has been recent trauma, when the suspicion of injury is low. CT Neck with contrast (CPT \u00ae 70491) and/or CT Cervical S pine without contrast (CPT\u00ae 72125) is indicated as the initial study to identify fracture or malalignment if plain radiographs are inconclusive or in individual s with a high risk mechanism of cervical spine injury within the last 3 months (See below**). MRI Cervical S pine without contrast (CPT\u00ae 72141) is also appropriate in the clinical setting of cervical spine trauma with an associated neurologic deficit.

The clinical evaluation mayinclude a relevant history and physical examination, including biopsy, appropriatelaboratory studies, and results of non- advanced or advanced imaging modalities. Because of the relatively small number of childhood cancer treatment centers, itis common to combine off -therapy visits with imaging and other subspecialist visits to accommodate families traveling long distances for their child's care. Unless otherwise stated in the disease- specific guideline, a histological confirmation of malignancy (or recurrence) and the stage of disease is required to perform amedical necessity review of the requested imaging. Unless otherwise stated in the disease- specific guideline, advanced imaging of asymptomatic individuals is not routinely supported without signs or symptoms ofsystemic involvement of cancer. Conventional imaging performed prior to diagnosis should not be repeated unless there is a delay of at least 6 weeks since previous imaging and treatment initiation orthere are new or significantly worsening clinical signs or symptoms Unless otherwise stated in the diagnosis -specific guidelines, imaging for treatment response can be approved after every 2 cycles, which is usually ~6 weeks of therapyfor solid tumors and usually ~8 to 12 weeks for CNS tumors Unless otherwise specified for a specific cancer type, once PET has beendocumented to be negative for a given individual 's cancer or all PET -avid disease has been surgically resected, PET should not be used for continued diseasemonitoring or surveillance unless one of the following applies: Conventional imaging (CT, MRI, US, plain film) reveals findings that areinconclusive or suspicious for recurrence Residual mass that has not changed in size since the last conventional imagingdoes not justify PET imaging PET avidity in a residual mass at the end of planned therapy is not an indicationfor PET imaging during surveillance Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

All other methods of reporting PET/MRI are inappropriate. When clinically appropriate, diagnostic MRI codes may be approved at the same time as the PET/MRI code combination. Unbundling PET/CT imaging into separate PET (such CPT \u00ae 78812 or CPT\u00ae 78813) and diagnostic CT codes is otherwise not supported. PET imaging is not reliable for the detection of anatomic lesions smaller than 8 mm in size. Delay PET/CT fo r at least 12 weeks after completion of radiation treatment, unless required sooner for imminent surgical resection. PET imaging using isotopes other than 18F-FDG , 68Ga-DOTATATE, or 68Ga- DOTATOC is considered investigational at this time. PET has not been shown to be diagnostically useful in all forms of childhood cancer. PET is supported for pediatric malignancies with significant published evidence regarding its diagnostic accuracy and importance in accurately directing individual care decisions. See diagnosis -specific guideline sections for details. PET imaging is not specific to cancer, and has a high rate of false positivity. Inflammation, infection (especially granulomatous), trauma, and post -operative healing may show high levels of FDG uptake and be false- positive for malignant lesions. PET for rare malignancies not specifically addressed by eviCore guidelines is generally not indicated, due to lack of available evidence regarding diagnostic accuracy of PET in the majority of rare cancers. Conventional imaging studies should be used for initial staging and treatment response for these diagnoses. PET can be approved if all of the following apply: Conventional imaging (CT, MRI, US, plain film) reveals findings that are equivocal or suspicious No other specific metabolic imaging (MIBG, octreotide, t echnetium, etc.) Is appropriate for the cancer type The submitted clinical information describes a specific decision regarding the individual 's care that will be made based on the PET results PET imaging for surveillance imaging only when specifically sta ted elsewhere in the diagnosis -specific guideline sections Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Pediatric Oncology Imaging Guidelines Unless otherwise specified for a specific cancer type, once PET has been documented to be negative for a given individual 's cancer or all PET -avid disease has been surgically resected, PET should not be used for continued disease monitoring or surveillance unless one of the following applies: Conventional imaging (CT, MRI, US, plain film) reveals findings that are inconclusive or suspicious for recurrence Residual mass that has not changed in size since the last conventional imaging does not justify PET imaging PET avidity in a residual mass at the end of planned therapy is not an indication for PET imaging during surveillance. Very rare circumstances where tumor markers or obvious clinical symptoms show strong evidence suggesting recurrence and PET would replace conventional imaging modalities The individual is undergoing salvage treatment for a recurrent solid tumor with residual measurable disease on conventional imaging and confirmed repeat negative PET imaging will allow the individual to transition from active treatment to surveillance Diagnostic Radiation Exposure in Pediatric Oncology (PEDONC -1.5) Young children are presumed to be at increased risk for malignancy from diagnostic radiation exposure, most commonly from CT and nuclear medicine imaging. They are more sensitive to radiation than adults and generally live longer after receiving radiation doses from medical procedures, resulting in a larger number of years during which to manifest a cancer. Because of this presumed increased risk in young children, requests to substitute MRI without and with contrast for CT with contrast to avoid radiation exposure can be approved if ALL of the following criteria apply: The individual is presently a young child and the ordering physician has documented the reason for MRI, rather than CT, is to avoid radiation exposure. The disease- specific guidelines do not list CT as superior to MRI for the current disease and time point, meaning the MRI will provide equivalent or superior information relative to CT. The request is for a body area other than Chest as MRI is substantially inferior to CT for detection of small pulmonary metastases. The guidelines listed in this section for certain specific indications are not intended to be all -inclusive; clinical judgment remains paramount and variance from these guidelines may be appropriate and warranted for specific clinical situations.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Pediatric Oncology Imaging Guidelines Screening Imaging in Cancer Predisposition Syndromes - General Considerations (PEDONC -2.1) This section is intended to give guidance for screening imaging prior to diagnosis with a specific malignancy. Once an individual with a cancer predisposition syndrome has been diagnosed with a malignant disease, future imaging decisions should be guided by the appropriate disease -specific guidelines except as explicitly stated elsewhere in this section. This section's guidelines are limited to cancer predisposition syndromes with screening imaging considerations. Syndromes requiring only clinical or laboratory screening are not discussed here. In general, a recent (within 60 days) detailed history and physical examination and appropriate laboratory studies should be performed prior to considering advanced imaging, unless the individual is undergoing guideline- supported scheduled screening evaluation identified in this section. Where MRI is indicated in these guidelines, CT may be approved only if MRI is contraindicated, given the risk of radiation exposure in these syndromes. Many of these cancer predisposition syndromes also affect adults as survival continues to improve for these individuals . Adults with syndromes covered in this section may follow these imaging guidelines except where contradicted by specific statements in the general imaging guidelines . Documentation of genetic or molecular confirmation of the appropriate syndrome with increased cancer risk is preferred for any individual to qualify for screening imaging. There are a number of complex ethical, social, and financial issues involved in the decision to complete genetic testing in a pediatric individual. From the 2013 AAP Policy Statement, \"Predictive genetic testing for adult -onset conditions generally should be deferred unless an intervention initiated in childhood may reduce morbidity or mortality.\" Imaging surveillance is one such intervention and should not be performed without justifiable cause. Genetic testing should be performed in conjunction with genetic counseling for appropriate communication of risks identified by testing. When genetic testing is not possible or not supported by health plan coverage policies, formal diagnosis after evaluation by a physician with significant training and/or experience in cancer predisposition syndromes (most commonly a geneticist or oncologist) is generally sufficient to confirm eligibility for screening imaging. Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Pediatric Oncology Imaging Guidelines Due to the length of time for image acquisition and the need for stillness, anesthesia is required for almost all infants and young children (age < 7 years), as well as older children with delays in development or maturity. In this patient population, MRI imaging sessions should be planned with a goal of avoiding a short -interval repeat anesthesia exposure due to insufficient information using the following considerations: MRI should always be performed without and with contrast unless there is a specific contraindication to gadolinium use, since the individual already has intravenous access for anesthesia. Recent evidence based literature demonstrates the potential for gadolinium deposition in various organs including the brain, after the use of MRI contrast. The U.S. food and drug administration (FDA) has noted that there is currently no evidence to suggest that gadolinium retention in the brain is harmful and restricting gadolinium -based contrast agents (GBCAS) use is not warranted at this time. It has been recommended that GBCA use should be limited to circumstances in which additional information provided by the contrast agent is necessary and the necessity of repetitive MRIs with GBCAS should be assessed. If requesting clinicians indicate that a non- contrast study is being requested due to concerns regarding the use of gadolinium, the exam can be approved. If multiple body areas are supported by eviCore guidelines for the clinical condition being evaluated, MRI of all necessary body areas should be obtained concurrently in the same anesthesia session Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) (PEDONC- 2.2) The following imaging studies should be considered appropriate in individuals with LFS: Indication Imaging Study All individuals BOTH of the following, annually: MRI Brain without and with approvable code for whole- body MRI at this time. Every 3 months from birth to age 18: Abdominal (CPT\u00ae 76700) and pelvic (CPT\u00ae 76856) ultrasound Beginning at age 20: Annual Breast MRI (CPT\u00ae 77049), alternating every 6 months with breast ultrasound, in addition to the previously noted ann ual MRI studies.

Eighty percent of individuals will have germline TP53 mutation: Tumor -specific TP53 mutations are much more common than germline TP53 mutations and are not associated with an increased risk for subsequent cancers If TP53- negative, formal diagnosis of LFS should be assigned by a physician with significant training and/or experience in LFS (most commonly a geneticist or oncologist) based on specified clinical criteria prior to beginning a screening imaging program TP53 mutations may be present in 50 to 80% of pediatric adrenocortical carcinoma, 10% of pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma, and 10% of pediatric osteosarcoma Individuals with LFS have an increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation, so screening strategies resulting in significant radiation exposure are not appropriate (CT and nuclear medicine). When a specific malignancy is suspected, the individual should be imaged according to the eviCore imaging guideline specific to the suspected cancer type Annual complete detailed physical examinations, complete blood counts, and urinalyses form the backbone of LFS cancer screening. Neurofibromatosis 1 and 2 (NF1 and NF2) (PEDONC -2.3) The following imaging studies should be considered appropriate in individuals with NF1: Indication Imaging Study Clarification of the diagnosis of NF1 if evaluation by a physician with significant training and/or experience in neurofibromatosis is inconclusive Most commonly a neurologist, geneticist, ophthalmologist, or oncologist One-time MRI Brain (CPT\u00ae 70553) and Orbits (CPT\u00ae 70543) without and with contrast New or worsening neurological or visual symptoms MRI Brain (CPT\u00ae 70553) and Orbits (CPT\u00ae 70543) without and with contrast Clinical symptoms suggestive of change in a known plexiform neurofibroma Examples include: pain, rapid growth, and neurologic dysfunction MRI without and with contrast Clinical symptoms concerning for malignant transformation of a known plexiform neurofibroma, and ALL of the following 78815 or 78816) Cardiology and Radiology 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Pediatric Oncology Imaging Guidelines Background and Supporting Information NF1: Common syndrome inherited in an autosomal dominant manner (50% risk to offspring) affecting 1 in 2500 people. The diagnosis is commonly made based on established clinical criteria including caf\u00e9- au-lait spots, lisch nodules of the iris, axillary freckling, family history, and the presence of NF- associated tumor s. Genetic testing is encouraged for children with possible NF1 and no family history prior to assigning a diagnosis, but will not identify a mutation for all individuals with NF1. The majority of tumor s are benign in nature, but malignant degeneration can occur. The most frequent neoplasms associated with NF1 in children are malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), glioma, pheochromocytoma, and leukemia. NF1-affected persons have increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation, so CT and nuclear medicine imaging are not appropriate screening or surveillance studies for these individuals . CT and/or nuclear medicine studies may be indicated for acute clinical situations and should be judged on a case- by-case basis. Annual ophthalmology evaluation is strongly recommended beginning at the time of diagnosis of NF1 to evaluate for optic pathway abnormalities : Screening MRIs Brain (CPT \u00ae 70553) and Orbits (CPT\u00ae 70543) for asymptomatic individuals are not generally recommended due to the ~60% rate of unidentified bright objects ( UBOs , T2-weighted signal abnormalities) which mostly disappear by age 30 Routine follow up imaging of UBOs is not warranted in the absence of acute symptoms suggesting new or worsening intracranial disease Individuals with NF1 are at increased risk for plexiform neurofibromas (PN) and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST\u2014 a high grade sarcoma) Screening imaging of asymptomatic individuals for these tumors is not supported by evidence. PET imaging is not supported for PN surveillance in asymptomatic individuals at this time as the positive predictive value is only 60 to 65% even in symptomatic individuals. Although PET imaging has a positive predictive value of only 61 to 63% in NF1 with suspected transformation to MPNST, the negative predictive value is high (96 to 99%) Considerations for PET/CT coding and indications/coding for PET/MRI are found in PET Imaging in Pediatric Oncology (PEDONC- 1.4) Inconclusive PET findings should lead to biopsy of the concerning lesion Repeat PET studies are not indicated due to the poor positive predictive value in this setting 2017 AACR recommendations support a single baseline Whole- Body MRI to asses s tumor burden in late adolescence or young adulthood.

Other patterns of inheritance include congenital multicentric disease limited to skin and muscle, congenital multicentric with a single visceral site, and congenital with multiple visceral site involvement. The condition is most commonly sporadic, though familial cases associated with PDGFRB and NOTCH3 have been described The majority of cases with skin or muscle only involvement regress spontaneously. Visceral cases are lethal in the absence of therapy in 75% of cases due to organ compression, particularly with cardiopulmonary involvement. If vital structures are involved or significant symptoms occur, treatment is generally radical resection. Chemotherapy is sometimes utilized for progressive or multifocal life threatening lesions. Infants may present with a single lesion and develop further lesions in the first two years of life. This scenario, along with the inability of infants to readily express symptoms, impacts the imaging studies that may be approved. Routine surveillance of cutaneous/muscular sites is not supported as spontaneous regression is common. Surveillance beyond the age of two years is not supported. References 1. Plon SE, Malkin D.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is rare in children, and the occurrence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) appears to have only been reported once in pediatric individuals to dat e Routine advanced imaging is not indicated in the evaluation and management of chronic myeloid leukemia in the absence of specific localizing clinical symptoms or clearance for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) (PEDONC- 3.2) Individuals with B- precursor or T -cell lymphoblastic lymphoma without bone marrow involvement are treated similarly to leukemia individuals of the same cell type and should be imaged according to this guideline section This section does not apply to individuals with mature B -cell histology (primarily Burkitt's in children). Please refer to Pediatric Aggressive Mature B -Cell Non - Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHL) (PEDONC- 5.3) for guide lines for these individuals Scrotal Ultrasound CPT\u00ae 76870 and/or doppler ultrasound of the scrotum 93975 or 93976 may be approved for suspected testicular involvement. Chest x -ray should be performed to evaluate for mediastinal mass in suspected cases or upon initial diagnosis. CT Che st with contrast (CPT\u00ae 71260) immediately to evaluate for airway compression and anesthesia safety prior to attempting histologic diagnosis if mediastinal widening is seen on chest x -ray Individuals with known or strongly suspected T- cell histology or other suspected lymphoblastic lymphoma involvement EITHER of the following for initial OR PET/CT (CPT\u00ae 78816) Indications and coding for rare circumstances where PET/MRI may be approved are found in PET Imaging in Pediatric Oncology (PEDONC- 1.4) MRI Brain without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70553) for individuals exhibiting CNS symptoms .

Individuals with residual masses can be evaluated with every new therapy phase (Consolidation, Interim maintenance, etc., generally every 8 to 12 weeks) until disease resolution is seen PET/CT (CPT\u00ae 78815) when residual mass 8 mm in diameter is present on recent CT imaging and immediate radiation or chemotherapy plan will be based on results . Residual mass of any size with no PET- avidity is considered a complete response at the extranodal/lymphomatous site. Chest x -ray or Abdominal ultrasound ( CPT\u00ae 76700) only, as indicated by site(s) of bulky disease present at diagnosis, for further surveillance, once CT imaging shows no evidence of disease. CT of all involved bulky nodal areas individuals with persistent residual masses performed as part of an end of therapy evaluation Immunosuppression during ALL therapy: CT or MRI requests for infectious disease concerns for individuals with ALL with: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <500 or Inconclusive findings on chest x -ray or ultrasound at any ANC during active treatment MRA/ MRV of the head (CPT\u00ae 70544, 70545, or 70546) To rule out bleeding associated with sinus venous thrombosis in individuals treated with asparaginase Imaging during therapy for relapsed ALL: Frequent CT or MRI imaging may be indicated to evaluate known or suspected new sites of invasive fungal or other aggressive infections Surveillance imaging of asymptomatic individual s to detect invasive fungal infection only when acute clinical decisions will be made based on the imaging Imaging of known or suspected osteonecrosis in ALL: MRI without contrast or without and with contrast of the affected joint(s) with symptoms suggesting osteonecrosis CT without contrast can be approved when MRI is contraindicated or unavailable, or for diagnosis of suspected subchondral fracture MRI Bilateral Hips (CPT \u00ae 73721 or CPT\u00ae 73723 with modifier - 50) once at 6 to 9 months after diagnosis for individual s age 11 years Repeat MRI without contrast of the affected joint(s) every 2 cycles of maintenance (every 6 months) if reintroduction of corticosteroids is being considered in individuals whose symptoms have resolved and are still receiving active treatment Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Individuals with ALL are severely immunocompromised during the first 4 to 6 weeks of treatment (induction) and any conventional imaging request to evaluate for infectious complications during this time frame should be approved immediately Individuals with ALL who relapse are treated with very intensive chemotherapy regimens and most spend the majority of their chemotherapy treatment phase in the hospital Individuals may have therapy -induced hypogammaglobulinemia which requires supplemental intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) during maintenance therapy. Those receiving supplemental IVIG should be treated similarly to individual s with ANC <500 with regards to imaging for infectious disease Osteonecrosis (ON) in individuals with ALL is a relatively common complication of ALL and its treatment, primary corticosteroids. Approximately 3% of younger children and 12 to 15% of adolescents are affected by ON at some point during therapy. The peak incidence occurs approximately one year from the time of diagnosis Screening MRI of asymptomatic individuals age 10 years to detect osteonecrosis has not been shown to impact individua l outcomes, and it is not standard to alter treatment based on imaging findings alone without symptoms If osteonecrosis is detected on initial MRI, corticosteroids are often withheld during maintenance chemotherapy (but continued in earlier phases of therapy). Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) (PEDONC -3.3) Frequent CT or MRI imaging may be indicated to evaluate known sites of invasive fungal infection Surveillance imaging of asymptomatic individuals to detect invasive fungal infection only when acute clinical decisions will be made based on the imaging Background and Supporting Information The majority of AML individuals do not have any bulky disease and routine advanced imaging is not necessary Advanced imaging may be indicated for rare individual s with bulky tumor masses (commonly referred to as chloromas , leukemic sarcomas, or myeloid sarcomas ) noted on physical examination or other imaging such as plain film or ultrasound Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Pediatric Oncology Imaging Guidelines Pediatric Lymphoma - General Considerations (PEDONC -5.1) Lymphoma mostly commonly involves the lymph nodes (LNs). However, lymphoma can also arise from primary lymphoid tissues (bone marrow or thymus) or various secondary lymphoid tissues (spleen, mucosa- associated lymphoid tissue) or non- lymphoid organs (skin, bone, brain, lungs, liver, sal ivary glands, etc.). Pediatric lymphomas are generally Hodgkin Lymphomas, Aggressive B -Cell Non - Hodgkin Lymphomas, Lymphoblastic Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphomas Individuals with Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (even those with bulky nodal disease) are treated using the leukemia treatment plan appropriate to the cell type (B or T cell). These individuals should be imaged using guidelines in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) (PEDONC- 3.2) Other histologies are rare in pediat ric individuals , and should be imaged -27.3) in zone or MALT lymphomas: Marginal Zone Lymphomas (ONC -27.4) in the Oncology Mantle cell Mantle Cell Lymphoma (ONC Lymphoma should be imaged using Oncology Imaging Guidelines All CT imaging recommended in this section refers to CT with contrast only. Noncontrast CT imaging has not been shown to be beneficial in the management of pediatric lymphomas Given the limited utility of noncontrast CT imaging in pediatric lymphomas, MRI without or without and with contrast is recommended in place of CT for individuals who cannot tolerate CT contrast due to allergy or impaired renal function MRI without and with contrast of symptomatic or previously involved bony areas can be approved in known lymphoma individuals without prior plain x -ray or bone scan evaluation Bone scan is inferior to MRI for evaluation of known or suspected bone metastases in lymphoma MRI Brain without and with contrast (CPT \u00ae 70553) is the preferred study for evaluation of suspected b rain metastases in pediatric lymphoma CT Head with (CPT\u00ae 70460) or without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70470) can be approved when MRI is contraindicated Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

The primary determinant of survival at recurrence is time to relapse, regardless of whether relapse is detected clinically or via imaging. NCCN pediatric HL guidelines recommend no pre- emptive surveillance imaging. Pediatric individuals have a high rate of neck involvement with Hodgkin Lymphoma Early treatment response evaluations involve both PET and CT as decisions about chemotherapy drug selection and radiation treatment are frequently made based on both anatomic (CT- based) and metabolic (PET/CT- based) responses.

Neuroblastoma is divided into very low, low, intermediate, and high risk disease based on International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) Staging System (see: Staging and Risk Grouping (PEDONC- 6.2)). The treatment approaches for each risk group vary widely and have distinct imaging strategies. The risk group for a given individual should be provided by the ordering provider in the clinical information provided for review . For metabolic imaging in individuals who are MI BG positive at diagnosis and then become MIBG negative in response to treatment : Continue to use MIBG (see: table below and PEDONC- 1.3 for coding) Study Type Coding Bone scan Any of the following codes can CPT\u00ae 78306 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) CPT\u00ae 78801 CPT\u00ae 78802 CPT\u00ae 78804 Any one of the following codes may also be approved, individual or in combination with for KNOWN neuroblastoma when only a single site follow up is desired, but is not sufficient for the initial workup of suspected disease.

All other radiotracers are considered investigational at this time: Indication Imaging Study Any of the following: Individuals with MIBG -negativity documented at initial diagnosis At major decision points (such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant or surgery), if MIBG and CT/MRI findings are inconclusive Whole body 18F- FDGPET/CT (CPT\u00ae 78816) In scenarios where PET/CT is supported, it does not preclude the other diagnostic imaging studies supported throughout PEDONC 6 . PET/CT is viewed as replacing MIBG in these scenarios. Indications and coding for rare circumstances where PET/MRI may be approved are found in PET Imaging in Pediatric Oncology (PEDONC-1.4) Individuals currently receiving medications that may interfere with MIBG uptake that cannot be safely discontinued prior to imaging, including: Tricyclic only be approved for this indication when specific documentation of the medication interaction is included with the current PET imaging request. Indications and coding for rare circumstances where PET/MRI may be approved are found in PET Imaging in Pediatric Oncology (PEDONC-1.4) Background and Supporting Information Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood, and generally arises from the adrenal gland or along the sympathetic chain. Neuroblastoma staging has recently changed to better incorporate the prognostic impact of biological and genetic characteristics, particularly segmental chromosome aberrations (SCA) as an additional genomic marker. SCAs of 1p or 11g are poor prognostic 90 95% neuroblastomas secrete homovanillic acid (HVA) and vannilylmandelic acid (VMA) in the urine, and u rine HVA/VMA should be performed at every disease evaluation for individuals with positive HVA or VMA at diagnosis 99mTc -MDP bone scan does not identify foci of disease that affect staging or clinical management and provides no advantage over MIBG scintigraphy and is not used for evaluation of most individuals with neuroblastoma Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Pediatric Oncology Imaging Guidelines Staging and Risk Grouping - Neuroblastoma (PEDONC -6.2) Most recent treatment protocols are using the updated International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) staging system L1: Localized tumor not involving vital structures as defined by the list of image- defined risk factors and confined to one body compartment Image- defined risk factors include a list of specific imaging findings defining individuals less likely to be candidates for complete surgical resection These risk factors involve the encasement of major blood vessels, airway, skull base, costovertebral junction, brachial plexus, spinal canal, or major organs or structures L2: Locoregional tumor with presence of one or more image- defined risk factors M: Distant metastatic disease (except stage MS) MS: Metastatic disease in children younger than 18 months with metastases confined to skin, liver, and/or bone marrow with <10% involvement (MIBG must be negative in bone and bone marrow) The tables for risk grouping are provided below for reference.

Adrenal nuclear imaging (CPT\u00ae 78075) Clinical signs/symptoms suggest brain involvement MRI Brain without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 70553) PET should not be used unless one of the exceptions stated in section Neuroblastoma - General Considerations (PEDONC- 6.1) is present Background and Supporting Information MIBG provides superior sensitivity and sensitivity for detecting viable osseous disease compared with bone scintigraphy so technetium bone scan is not necessary when MIBG is utilized. MIBG is positive in 90 to 95% of neuroblastomas. Most MIBG imaging studies are SPECT/CT studies using CT for localization only. Separate diagnostic CT codes should not be approved for this purpose Occasionally MIBG cannot be performed prior to initiation of therapy. In this circumstance, MIBG should be completed within 3 weeks of therapy initiation as the reduction in MIBG avidity in response to chemotherapy is not immediate. Inability to complete MIBG before starting therapy is not an indication to approve PET imaging MRI Brain of asymptomatic individuals with no history of brain metastases is not indicated for neuroblastoma but may be approved for signs and symptoms of brain involvement .

Background and Supporting Information: Many individuals will present with an asymptomatic abdominal mass, and will undergo ultrasound as a primary evaluation. Individual s with bilateral Wilms Tumor may begin therapy without a histologic diagnosis to preserve a localized disease stage and attempt to shrink the tumor s to allow for renal -sparing surgical approaches. Only ~0.5% of Wilms tumor individual s will ever develop brain metastases If treating with chemotherapy without a biopsy, disease evaluation is indicated at week 6. If either tumor has not shrunk 50%, then open biopsy is indicated to confirm favorable histology. If partial nephrectomy still not feasible at week 6, the next disease evaluation is at week 12. Surgical resection should occur no later than week 12.

Background and Supporting Information Soft tissue sarcomas oc cur in both adult and pediatric individuals , but some are more common in one age group than the other. Pediatric soft tissue sarcomas are divided into two groups: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) accounts for ~60% of soft tissue sarcomas in young individual s, but only ~25% of soft tissue sarcomas in adolescents Non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NRSTS) which encompasses all other histologic subtypes Because RMS can arise from any muscle tissue, the presenting symptoms and primary tumor sites vary widely and strongly influence the appropriate imaging decisions CT with contrast is the preferred primary site imaging modality for RMS arising in the thoracic cavity (not the chest wall) MRI without and with contrast is the preferred primary site imaging modality f or RMS occurring in all other anatomic locations, including the chest wall.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Pediatric Oncology Imaging Guidelines Background and Supporting Information General Considerations: Malignant pediatric germ cell tumors commonly include one of four histologic subtypes : Yolk sac tumor Choriocarcinoma Embryonal carcinoma Mixed histology Tumors can occur in testicular, ovarian or extragonadal primary locations Ovarian masses that are <10 cm in size, have minimal or no visible solid component on ultrasound, and have normal tumor markers are almost universally benign teratomas or functional cysts Advanced imaging is not necessary Sex cord stromal tumors (granulosa cell, theca, sertoli, and leydig tumors) are rare in pediatri cs and should be imaged according to general guidelines in : Testicular, Ovarian and Extragonadal Germ Cell Tumors (ONC -20) in the Oncolog y Imaging Guidelines . This section applies to primary germ cell tumors occurring outside the central nervous sy stem in children who are 15 years old at the time of initial diagnosis. For individuals who are >15 y ears old at diagnosis, the overall prognosis is inferior and these individual s should be imaged according to general guidelines in: Testicular, Ovarian and Extragonadal Germ Cell Tumors (ONC -20) in the Oncolog y Imaging Guidelines . For CNS germ cell tumors, use the imaging guidelines in: CNS Germinomas and Non-Germinomatous Germ Cell Tumors (NGGCT) (PEDONC- 4.7). Treatment Considerations: Overall treatment strategies are similar for all malignant germ cell tumors . Individuals with localized GCT are often cured with surgery alone and do not receive adjuvant t herapy. These individuals should be imaged using surveillance guidelines after surgery is completed. Individual s receiving adjuvant chemotherapy are usually treated with 4 to 6 cycles of combination chemotherapy. Imaging Modality Considerations: Initial e valuation of: Ovarian, testicular, and abdominal extragonadal suspected GCT should be completed by ultrasound and tumor markers (AFP, - hCG) Once a primary mass suspected to be GCT is discovered, initial staging is indicated prior to histologic confirmation The degree of abdominal exploration and node sampling necessary for adequate staging is determined in part by imaging findings and is required for preoperative planning The primary method of response assessment is by tumor marker decrease Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Pediatric Oncology Imaging Guidelines The primary method of surveillance in pediatric GCT is frequent assessment of serum tumor markers, unless tumor markers were not elevated at diagnosis Surveillance imaging of the chest in disease stages I -IV should generally be performed using chest x -ray See surveillance indications for specific imaging recommendations There has been no published evidence to date supporting the routine use of PET/CT in the evaluation of pediatric GCT Additionally, PET has been found to have similar efficacy to CT imaging in initial staging of adults with non- seminomatous GCT (the majority of pediatric GCT are non-seminomatous) PET as a marker of treatment response has been shown not to be predictive of individual outcomes in GCT and should not be approved Suspicious lesions seen on conventional imaging should be biopsied to confirm active disease References 1.

Abdominal ult rasound is indicated if tumor thrombus was detected at initial diagnosis If no tumor thrombus was present, continued ultrasound evaluations are not indicated without a specific reason documented in the clinical records PET/CT should only be considered in very rare circumstances for preoperative planning when MRI and CT scans are insufficient for surgical decision making. Hepatoblastoma Surveillance Imaging: For surveillance in individuals with an AFP of >100 ng/ml CT Chest and Abdomen with contrast (CPT\u00ae 71260 and CPT\u00ae 74160) for any clinically significant rise in tumor markers or symptoms suggesting recurrent disease For individuals with AFP 100 ng/ml at diagnosis or recurrence, the following imaging is appropriate: CT Abdomen with contrast (CPT \u00ae 74160) every 3 months for 2 years , then every 4 months for 2 years after completion of all therapy Chest x-ray or CT Chest with contrast (CPT\u00ae 71260) every 3 months for 2 years , then every 4 months for 2 years after completion of all therapy Individuals with brain or bone metastases should have surveillance imaging on the same schedule as the primary site imaging with the same modality used during initial staging Background and Supporting Information Pediatric liver tumors primarily include hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, but hepatic germ cell tumors and primary hepatic sarcomas occur with some frequency. Tumor markers are useful for initial evaluation as well as treatment response, particularly in hepatoblastom a. Early consideration of liver transplant may be undertaken in children and adolescents with unresectable localized disease, provided that the disease remains confined to the liver. Hepatoblastoma occurs most commonly in very young children (median diagn osis age of 19 months). Most cases of hepatoblastoma are sporadic, but some are associated with genetic abnormalities, including Beckwith- Wiedemann syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and trisomy 18. Most suspected liver tumors will have ultrasound and tumor markers (AFP, -HCG, CEA) as part of the initial evaluation. Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Pediatric Oncology Imaging Guidelines There has been no published evidence to date supporting the routine use of PET/CT imaging in the evaluation of pediatric Hepatoblastoma during initial imaging, treatment response, or sur veillance. PET/CT should not be approved in lieu of biopsy of suspicious lesions Individuals with localized hepatoblastoma of pure fetal histology are often cured with surgery alone and do not receive adjuvant therapy. These individuals should be imaged using surveillance guidelines after surgery is completed. Individuals receiving adjuvant chemotherapy are usually treated with 2 to 8 cycles of combination chemotherapy. Tumor marker decrease is important in response assessment but does not eliminate the need for advanced imaging in individuals with unresected hepatoblastoma. The primary method of surveillance in hepatoblastoma is frequent assessment of serum tumor markers (primarily AFP). No specific imaging for surveillance in individuals with an AFP of >100 ng/mL at diagnosis or recurrence. Pediatric Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) (PEDONC -11.3) Pediatric HCC Initial Staging: Ultrasound may be approved even after MRI or CT imaging in order to allow evaluation for tumor thrombus Once a primary liver mass is discovered, definitive imaging prior to histologic diagnosis including ANY of the following: CT Abdomen and Pelvis with contrast (CPT \u00ae 74177) Abdomen and and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 74183 and CPT\u00ae 72197) Some tumors may require both MRI and CT during initial evaluation MRA Abdomen (CPT\u00ae 74185) or CTA Abdomen (CPT\u00ae 74175) to evaluate vascular Chest with (CPT\u00ae 71260) or without contrast (CPT\u00ae 71250) in the initial work -up of all pediatric liver tumors and should be completed prior to anesthesia exposure if possible MRI Brain without and with contrast (CPT \u00ae 70553) only for symptoms suggesting CNS metastases Nuclear bone scan (See Modality General Considerations (PEDONC- 1.3)) shoul d be used for initial ev aluation of bony metastases only in individual s with systemic symptoms or bone pain Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

HCC, including its rare histologically distinct variant fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL- HCC), occurs mostly in o lder children and adolescents. Despite recent advances in treatment, overall survival of pediatric HCC diagnosed in advanced stages remains exceedingly poor, with five- year survival of only 17% to 22% for all stages of pediatric HCC (and FL- HCC).

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Pediatric Oncology Imaging Guidelines Retinoblastoma - General Considerations (PEDONC -12.1) Retinoblastoma (RB) is primarily a disease of the infant and young child, and presents with leukocoria (loss of red reflex). About 75% of individuals are diagnosed before the age of two years (bilateral RB presents at 12 months of age). Retinoblastoma can occur as heritable (25% of cases) or nonheritable (75%) disease. Heritable RB is associated with a germline mutation in the RB1 gene often resulting typically in bilateral disease. Individuals who carry the RB1 mutation also have increased risk of developing other cancers, such as osteosarcoma, soft tissue s arcomas, or melanoma. For more information heritable retinoblastoma, see: Familial Retinoblastoma Syndrome (PEDONC -2.12) . Whole body MRI has shown poor sensitivity and specificity in individuals with predisposition to systemic malignancy due to germline RB1 mutations, and is not supported. Detailed evaluation by a physician with significant training and/or experience in retinoblastoma (most commonly a pediatric ophthalmologist or pediatric oncol ogist) is indicated prior to considering advanced imaging. Retinoblastoma can be unilateral, bilateral, or trilateral (involving the pineal gland). Extraocular spread of retinoblastoma is rare and generally confined to the b rain.

MRI Orbits (CPT \u00ae 70543) and Brain (CPT\u00ae 70553) for individuals undergoing ocular salvage treatment approaches every 6 months for 2 years following completion of therapy MRI Brain without and with contrast (CPT \u00ae 70553) can be approved every 6 months for 5 years f rom the time of diagnosis with retinoblastoma Background and Supporting Information CT should generally be avoided in retinoblastoma individuals under one year of age or with family history of retinoblastoma (heritable) due to substantially increased risks for secondary malignancy The primary method of surveillance in retinoblastoma is examination under anesthesia (EUA), although some older children can be sufficiently evaluated by exam without anesthesia (EWA). Surveillance using advanced imaging is generally not indicated for unilateral retinoblastoma after enucleation or exenteration, but can be approved for evaluation of specific clinical conce rns. Individuals with bilateral retinoblastoma or germline mutation in RB1 are at increased risk for subsequent pineoblastoma Routine MRI follow up for pineal disease is not currently supported by evidence in unilateral retinoblastoma individuals without germline RB1 mutations Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines Version 1.0 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Staging is assigned using the Americ an Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging for adult melanoma. Most cases of melanoma arising in children and AYAs (~75%) are localized at diagnosis, and approximately 90% of individuals with pediatric melanoma are amenable to radical excision. The clinic al management of adolescents and young adults with melanoma is still challenging and evolving because it is difficult to diagnose, and there is no standard treatment. Non-melanoma skin cancers (mostly basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) are extremely rare in pediatric individuals. In many cases, predisposing factors such as prolonged immunosuppression, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, voriconazole use, or a combination of the factors are present, and established age- specific guidelines for management of these skin tumors do not exist. Imaging guidelines and treatment approaches are consistent with those used for adults w ith melanoma and other skin cancers, and these individual s should follow the imaging guidelines in section Melanomas and Other Skin Cancers (ONC -5) in the Oncology Imaging Guidelines .

MRI has very limited utility in evaluation of pediatric breast masses prior to biopsy, but may be indicated in rare cases for surgical planning when ultrasound is non- diagnostic. Pediatric individ uals with confirmed breast cancer should be imaged according to section Breast Cancer (ONC -11) in the Oncology Imaging Guidelines. Background and Supporting Information Less than 1% of pediatric breast lesions are malignant, and advanced imaging is generally not recommended without histological confirmation of malignancy. Mammography has limited utility in pediatric breast mass evaluation due to the high mammographic breast density in this age group, and the risk of the radiation exposure outweighs the benefit of this modality. As a result, mammography is NOT recommended for evaluation of pediatric or adolescent breast masses. BI-RADS classification may overstate the risk of malignancy or need for biopsy in pediatric individuals . References 1. Rodriguez -Galindo C, Furman WL, Pappo AS. Rare pediatric tumors.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOC Pediatric Oncology Imaging Guidelines Long Term Pediatric Cancer Survivors - General Considerations (PEDONC -19.1) This section applies to individuals who have passed the end of the surveillance imaging period for their specific cancer, or 5 years after completion of therapy, whichever occurs first As these are long term survivors, many individuals falling under this guideline section will have reached adult age. However, these guidelines relate specifically to late effects of childhood cancer treatment and should be applied to all long term childhood cancer survivors regardless of current age The Children's Oncology Group has published comprehensive guidelines for the management of long- term childhood cancer survivors, and these are available at: http://www.survivorshipguidelines.org A summary of cancer treatment should be available for all indiv iduals in this category and should generally include, at minimum: Type of cancer and stage Dates of diagnosis, recurrence, cancer -related surgeries, beginning and end dates of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and/or stem cell transplant Protocol number used for treatment and cumulative chemotherapy drug dose exposures Cumulative radiation dose, fraction number, modality, and field exposure Annual detailed history and complete physical examination is a critical component of cancer survivorship care and along with laboratory testing serves as the primary method of screening for the majority of late effects Advanced imaging for asymptomatic screening is not routinely indicated except as specified in this section Imaging requests related to new clinical signs or symptoms in a long term cancer survivor not explicitly covered in this section should be reviewed according to the guideline for the individual's cancer type or the relevant non- malignant clinical anthracycline chemotherapy, cardiotoxic immunotherapy, or cardiac exposure to radiotherapy SCREENING ECHOCARDIOGRAM INDICATIONS Age at time of Exposure Cumulative Doxorubicin Equivalent Dose Cumulative radiation dose to cardiac muscle Echocardiogram frequency All ages None None None 0-0.99 years 250 mg/m2 None Annual 0-249 mg/m2 Any dose Annual 0-249 mg/m2 None Every 2 years 1-4.99 years 250 Annual 0-249 mg/m2 15+ Gy Annual Cardiology and Radiology Imaging Guidelines 2023 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

See: Stress Testing with Imaging - Indications (CD- 1.4) for imaging guidelines. Female cancer survivors who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant: If any of the following are present, echocardiogram is recommended as a baseline e xam and in the 3rd trimester, and as clinically indicated for symptoms (see: Pregnancy - Maternal Imaging (CD- 11.4) in the Cardiology Imaging Guidelines) if ANY of the following are present: Anthracycline or cardiotoxic chemotherapy/immunotherapy exposure Chest radiotherapy Background and Supporting Information Exposure to cardiotoxic anthracycline chemotherapy agents is common in pediatric oncology due to the high success rate of this drug class in the treatment of pediatric cancers. Cardiac risk is assessed based on the age of the individual at the time of treatment initiation, the cumulative drug exposure expressed as doxorubicin equivalent mg/m 2, and the presence or absence of radiotherapy exposure to cardiac muscle.

Colonoscopy remains the preferred screening modality for survivors at highest risk of colorectal cancer Osteonecrosis in Long Term Cancer Survivors (PEDONC -19.4) Osteonec rosis is associated with corticosteroid, chemotherapy , and radiation exposure during treatment for ALL , NHL, and allogeneic HSCT in pediatrics. Osteonecrosis occurs primarily in hips, knees, and ankles and is frequently multifocal . Osteoradionecrosis of the jaw can occur in individual s receiving radiotherapy to the mandible or maxilla; those receiving 40 Gy are at highest risk. Although unusual, it can also occur in any bone without symptoms. It is rare in other disease types. Plain films of symptomatic areas are indicated prior to advanced imaging. Routine bone density screening using DEXA or Q uantitative CT screening has not been well normalized in the pediatric population, but imaging can be approved for those with symptoms to suggest bone density issues DEXA or Quantitative CT screening is generally not recommended until age 18 unless a specific intervention will be planned based on the imaging results. Serial advanced imaging is not indicated in osteonecrosis without specific documentation regarding how the advanced imaging will change current individual management When advanced imaging is necessary for acute management decisions, MRI without contrast of the affected joint(s) can be approved. Surveillance imaging of asymptomatic individual s to detect osteonecrosis has not been shown to impact individual outcomes, and it is not standard to alter treatment based on imaging findings alone without symptoms. Follow up MRI of incidentally discovered osteonecrosis findings in asymptomatic individual s has not been shown to impact individual outcomes and is not necessary See: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) (PEDONC- 3.2) for i nformat ion on imaging osteonecrosis in ALL individual s during active treatment.

Unless otherwise stated in a specific guideline section, repeat imaging studies of thepelvis are not necessary unless there is evidence for progression of disease, newonset of disease, and/or documentation of how repeat imaging will affect individualmanagement or treatment decisions. Ultrasound Ultrasound should be the initial imaging in most pelvic conditions to rule outthose situations that do not require additional advanced imaging. For those individual s who do require advanced imaging after ultrasound, ultrasound can be very beneficial in selecting the proper modality, body area, image sequences, and contrast level that will provide the most definitive information for the individual . CPT \u00ae codes vary by body area and presence or absence of Doppler imaging and are included in the table at the beginning of this guideline. Transabdominal ultrasound is appropriate in all pediatric individual s. Transvaginal (TV) ultrasound is appropriate in pediatric individual s who are sexually active or use a tampon and consent to the study. Ultrasound (complete CPT \u00ae 76856 or, limited CPT\u00ae 76857) should substitute for TV in pediatric individual s or non- sexually active adult females. Pediatric Pelvis Imaging Age Considerations ( PEDPV- 1.1) Many conditions affecting the pelvis in the pediatric population are different diagnoses than those occurring in the adult population. For those diseases which occur in both pediatric and adult populations, minor differences may exist in management due to individual age, comorbidities, and differences in disease natural history between children and adults. Individual s who are 18 years old and younger 11 should be imaged according to the Pediatric Pelvis Imaging Guidelines if discussed. Any conditions not specificallydiscussed in the Pediatric Pelvis Imaging Guidelines should be imaged according tothe General Pelvis Imaging Guidelines . Individual s who are > 18 years should be imaged according to the General Pelvis Imaging Guidelines, except where directed otherwise by a specific guideline section.

Due to the length of time required for MRI acquisition and the need to minimize individual movement , anesthesia is usually required for almost all infants (except neonates) and young children (age <7 years) as well as older children with delays in development or maturity. This anesthesia may be administered vi a oral or intravenous routes. In this individual population, MRI sessions should be planned with a goal of minimizing anesthesia exposure by adhering to the following considerations: MRI procedures can be performed without and/or with contrast use as supported by these condition- based guidelines. If int ravenous access will already be present for anesthesia administration and there is no contraindication for using contrast, imaging without and with contrast may be appropriate if requested. By doing so, the requesting provider may avoid repetitive anesthesia administration to perform an MRI with contrast if the initial study without contrast is inconclusive. Recent evidence based literature demonstrates the potential forgadolinium deposition in various organs including the brain, after the use of MRI contrast. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has noted that there iscurrently no evidence to suggest that gadolinium retention in the brain isharmful and restricting gadolinium -based contrast agents (GBCAs) use is not warranted at this time. It has been recommended that GBCA useshould be limited to circumstances in which additional informationprovided by the contrast agent is necessary and the necessity of repetitiveMRIs with GBCAs should be assessed. If multiple body areas are supported by eviCore guidelines for the clinical condition being evaluated, MRI of all necessary body areas should be obtained concurrently in the same anesthesia session. The presence of surgical hardware or implanted devices may preclude MRI . The selection of best examination may require coordination between the provider and the imaging service.

In general, CT P elvis is appropriate when evaluating solid pelvic organs. In general, CT Abdomen and Pelvis is appropriate when evaluating inflammatory or infections processes, hematuria, or conditions which appear to involve both the abdomen and the pelvis. In some cases, especially in follow -up of a known finding, it may be appropriate to limit the exam to the region of concern to reduce radiation exposure. The contrast level in pediatric CT imaging is specific to the clinical indication, as listed in the specific guideline sections. CT Pelvis or Abdomen and Pelvis may be indicated for further evaluation of abnormalities suggested on prior US or MRI Procedures. CT may be appropriate without prior MR I or US, as indicated in specific sections of these guidelines. CT should not be used to replace MRI in an attempt to avoid sedation unless listed as a recommended study in a specific guideline section. The selection of best examination may require coordination between the provider and the imaging service. Nuclear Medicine Nuclear medicine studies are rarely used in imaging of the pediatric pelvis, but are indicated in rare circumstances, including the following: Lymph system mapping (CPT \u00ae 78195) is lower extremity lymphedema recent negative Doppler ultrasound, or a history of Milroy's disease or prior pelvic lymph node dissection. 3D Rendering 3D Rendering indications in pediatric pelvis imaging are identical to those in thegeneral imaging guidelines.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, IncClick Here to Return to Main TOC Pediatric PND Imaging Guidelines General Guidelines (PEDPN -1.0) A pertinent clinical evaluation including a detailed history, physical examination since the onset or change in symptoms with a thorough neurologic examination, appropriate laboratory studies , and basic imaging such as plain radiography or ultrasound should be performed prior to considering advanced imaging (CT, MR I, Nuclear Medicine), unless the individual is undergoing guideline- supported scheduled follow- up imaging evaluat ion. A meaningful technological contact (telehealth visit, telephone call, electronic mail or messaging) since the onset or change in symptoms can serve as a pertinent clinical evaluation. EMG may not be of clinical utility or obtainable in infants or indi viduals with severe developmental delay EMG/NCS results may not be abnormal until 10 days after injury , Unless otherwise stated in a specific guideline section, the use of advanced imagingto screen asymptomatic individual s for disorders involving the peripheral nervous system is not supported. Advanced imaging of the peripheral nervous system is only appropriate in individual s who have documented active clinical signs or symptoms of disease involving the peripheral nervous system. Unless otherwise stated in a specific guideline section, repeat imaging studies of theperipheral nervous system are not necessary unless there is evidence forprogression of disease, new onset of disease, and/or documentation of how repeat imaging will affect individual management or treatment decisions. Age Considerations (PEDPN-1.1) Many conditions affecting the peripheral nervous system in the pediatric populationare different diagnoses than those occurring in the adult population. For those diseases which occur in both pediatric and adult populations, minor differences mayexist in management due to individual age, comorbidities, and differences in disease natural history between children and adults. Individual s who are 18 years old or younger 14 should be imaged according to the Pediatric Peripheral Nerve Disorders Imaging Guidelines if discussed. Any conditions not specifically discussed in the Pediatric Peripheral Nerve DisorderImaging Guidelines should be imaged according to the General Peripheral NerveDisorder Imaging Guidelines . Individual s who are > 18 years old should be imaged according to the General Peripheral Nerve Disorders Imaging Guidelines, except where directed otherwise by a specific guideline s ection.

Copyright \u00a9 2022 United HealthCare Services, IncClick Here to Return to Main TOC Pediatric PND Imaging Guidelines Modality General Considerations (PEDPN -1.3) MRI MRI without and with contrast is the preferred modality for pediatric peripheralnerve imaging unless otherwise stated in a specific guideline section. Due to the length of time required for MRI acquisition and the need to minimize individual movement , anesthesia is usually required for almost all infants (exce pt neonates) and young children (age <7 years) as well as older children with delays in development or maturity. This anesthesia may be administered via oral or int ravenous routes. In this individual population, MRI sessions should be planned with a goal of minimizing anesthesia exposure by adhering to the following considerations: MRI procedures can be performed without and/or with contrast use as supported by these condition based guidelines. If int ravenous access will already be present for anesthesia administration and there is no contraindication for using contrast, imaging without and with contrast may be appropriate if requested. By doing so, the requesting provider may avoid repetitive anesthesia administration to perform an MRI with contrast if the initial study without contrast is inconclusive. Recent evidence based literature demonstrates the potential forgadolinium deposition in various organs including the brain after the use ofMRI contrast. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has noted that there iscurrently no evidence to suggest that gadolinium retention in the brain isharmful and restricting gadolinium -based contrast agents (GBCAs) use is not warranted at this time. It has been recommended that GBCA useshould be limited to circumstances in which additional informationprovided by the contrast agent is necessary and the necessity of repetitiveMRIs with GBCAs should be assessed. If multiple body areas are supported by eviCore guidelines for the clinical condition being evaluated, MRI of all necessary body areas should be obtained concurrently in the same anesthesia session. CT CT is rarely used in the evaluation of pediatric peripheral nerve disorders. Seespecific guideline sections for indications. Ultrasound Ultrasound is rarely used in the evaluation of pediatric peripheral nerve disorders.See specific guideline sections for indications. Nuclear Medicine Nuclear medicine studies are not generally indicated in the evaluation ofperipheral nerve disorders.

If the diagnosis remains unclear, advanced imaging can be helpful as a preoperative study to evaluate the anatomy of brachial plexus lesions which should have already been defined by clinical examination. MRI is the preferred modality for imaging the brachial plexus. The goal of imaging is to visualize the entire course of the neural network from the preganglionic to thepostganglionic segments. CT is not often useful and should not be used as a substitute for MRI. MRI Upper Extremity Other Than Joint without contrast (CPT \u00ae 73218) or without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 73220) is indicated for unilateral brachial plexus . MRI Chest without contrast (CPT\u00ae 71550) or without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 71552) is indicated for b ilateral brachial plexus studies . MRI Neck without contrast (CPT\u00ae 70540) is indicated f or upper trunk lesions . It is rare for more than one CPT\u00ae code to be necessary to adequately image the brachial plexus area of interest. MRI Shoulder without contrast (CPT\u00ae 73221) or without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 73223) is indicated in infants with brachial plexopathy due to birth trauma if requested for preoperative planning. These individual s often have glenohumeral dysplasia and require shoulder surgery. Ultrasound also may be indicated in infants with brachial plexus injury to show the glenoid dysplasia and associated shoulder subluxation MRI Cervical Spine without contrast (CPT\u00ae72141) is indicated i f there is clinical suspicion for cervical nerve root avulsion. PET/CT skull base to mid- thigh (CPT\u00ae 78815) is appropriate if there is a contraindication to MRI in individuals with a known malignancy or post -treatment syndrome.

Annual surveillance imaging of known vascular or lymphatic malformations can be approved for body areas where growth could cause significant organ dysfunction or functional impairment. Background and Supporting Information Vascular and lymphatic malformations encompass a broad variety of conditions and have very heterogeneous natural history and treatment approaches. Lesions can be divided into low flow lesions (lymphatic, capillary and venous malformations), and high flow lesions and fistulas). Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

MRI without contrast or without and with contrast of the affected body part is indicated for: oLymphatic malformations involving deep tissues oMalformations too large to be completely imaged with ultrasound oInconclusive ultrasound findings oPreoperative planning CT is of limited value in evaluating lymphatic malformations oCT with contrast of the affected body part is indicated for lesions with acute enlargement and concerns for compression when MRI is contraindicated. Background and Supporting Information Lymphatic malformations are composed of dilated lymphatic channels filled with proteinaceous fluid and do not connect to normal lymphatic channels. They are typically soft, non-pulsatile masses with normal overlying skin. Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

MRI without contrast or without and with contrast of the affected body part is indicated for venous malformations for preoperative assessment to evaluate the extent of malformation and their relationship to normal structures. MRA or CTA has a limited role in evaluating most venous malformations, but may be indicated (contrast as requested of the affected body part) if MRI or CT is equivocal and the results will impact acute management decisions. CT can also be used to characterize venous malformations and their relationship to normal structures, but is generally not as accurate as MRI. oCT with contrast of the affected body part is indicated when MRI is inconclusive or contraindicated oBoth Klippel-Tr\u00e9naunay syndrome and CLOVES syndrome have been found to have increased risk of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, particularly after surgery or sclerotherapy. When pulmonary embolism is suspected in such individuals, CT Chest with contrast with PE protocol (CPT\u00ae 71260) or CTA Chest (CPT\u00ae 71275) is indicated. Background and Supporting Information Venous malformations are slow-flow lesions characterized by dilated venous spaces and a normal arterial component. They are soft, compressible, non-pulsatile lesions that are usually blue to deep purple in color. Lesions can range from very small to large infiltrating ones. Some may change size with Valsalva. Venous malformations are usually isolated, but they may be seen in multiple syndromes including Klippel-Trenaunay (KT) syndrome, Blue Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

MRI without contrast or without and with contrast of the affected body part is also indicated for evaluation of AVMs, and is useful in evaluating the extent of AVMs and their relationship to normal structures. MRA (contrast as requested) of the affected body part is indicated for evaluation and surveillance of known AVMs. It is unusual for both MRI and MRA to be necessary for routine treatment response or surveillance imaging of AVMs, but both may be indicated for preoperative planning. CT and CTA can also be used to characterize AVMs and their relationship to normal structures, but is generally not better than MRI and has associated radiation risks. oCT with contrast and/or CTA (contrast as requested) of the affected body part is indicated when MRI and/or MRA is inconclusive or contraindicated. Background and Supporting Information Arteriovenous malformations are characterized by a network of multiple abnormal vascular channels interposed between enlarged feeding arteries and draining veins. The arteriovenous fistula has a single communication interposed between a feeding artery and a draining vein. The normal capillary bed is absent in both lesions. Both lesions may have an aggressive clinical course and are characterized by a reddish pulsatile mass which has a thrill or bruit. Though often recognized at birth, these lesions may grow and present near adolescence. Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Ultrasound with Doppler can be used when the diagnosis is uncertain, or with high risk clinical considerations. Other general imaging considerations for other vascular neoplasms regarding MRI, MRA, CT, and CTA also apply to infantile hemangiomas. See Vascular Tumors (PEDPVD-2.6) . Multiple (5 or more) infantile hemangiomas can be associated with hepatic hemangiomas, with risk potential for high-output cardiac failure, and other risks see Multiple Infantile Hemangiomas (PEDPVD 5.2) . High-output cardiac failure can also be caused rarely by large cutaneous infantile hemangiomas. Affected infants may present with \"failure-to-thrive\", a hyperdynamic precordium, tachycardia, bounding pulses with a widened pulse pressure, and a palpable thrill and/or audible bruit over the hemangioma. This is an indication for cardiac evaluation, including echocardiography (CPT\u00ae 93303 ordered with CPT\u00ae 93320 and CPT\u00ae 93325). Life threatening risk of airway obstruction is associated with infantile hemangiomas of the lower face (\"beard distribution\"), or of the anterior neck, or of the oral and/or pharyngeal mucosa. Location-associated functional impairment can be found with periocular infantile hemangiomas larger than 1 cm (impairing vision), or infantile hemangiomas involving lip(s) or oral cavity (impairing feeding) Ulceration can occur with profuse bleeding that can be life threatening. Disfigurement risk is increased with large (5 cm or larger) infantile hemangiomas, facial or scalp infantile hemangiomas, and breast infantile hemangiomas in female infants. An infantile hemangioma at least 2.5 cm in diameter overlying the lumbar spine or sacrum is an indication to do a spinal ultrasound (under 6 months of age) and/or MRI Lumbar Spine without contrast (CPT\u00ae 72148) or MRI Lumbar Spine without and with contrast (CPT\u00ae 72158). Infantile hemangiomas 5 cm or larger in size have an increased risk of extracutaneous structural abnormalities. Other high risk indications include Syndromes or Associations with extracutaneous structural changes: for . Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCPediatric Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 Background and Supporting Information Infantile Hemangiomas are the most common benign tumor of childhood, occurring in close to 5% of infants. Infantile Hemangiomas typically have a phase of rapid and significant growth between 1 and 3 months of age; growth is usually completed by 5 months of age. Gradual involution then occurs, completed in 90% by age of 4 years, but with residual skin changes frequently persisting. Though usually not needed for diagnosis, biopsy can be done when needed to identify unique markers not found on other vascular tumors. When treatment is needed, imaging may be used to monitor response; consultation with a Hemangioma specialist may be useful in guiding evaluation, treatment, and follow up.

In rare cases, the face or scalp is not involved, with a large infantile hemangioma located on the torso and/or upper extremity instead. Cerebrovascular anomalies, present in more than 90% of individuals with PHACE(S) syndrome, are the most common extracutaneous feature of the syndrome, followed by cardiac anomalies (67%) and structural brain anomalies (about 50%). Indications for imaging a young child for suspected PHACE(S) syndrome include the following: oLarge (5 or more cm in diameter) infantile hemangioma of the face, scalp, and/or neck. oInfantile hemangioma on face, scalp, or neck that is smaller than 5 cm in diameter, but with at least one major anomaly found in PHACE(S) syndrome, such as coarctation of the aorta or midline ventral defect. oWithout any visible facial infantile hemangioma, PHACE(S) syndrome can also reasonably be suspected with the following: Infantile hemangioma on upper chest or proximal upper extremity that is 5 cm or larger in size, with also major anomalies found in PHACE(S) syndrome Large intraorbital infantile hemangioma.

A meaningful technological contact (telehealth visit, telephone call, electronic mail or messaging) can serve as a pertinent clinical evaluation. For those spinal conditions/disorders for which the Spine Imaging Guidelines require a plain x-ray of the spine prior to consideration of an advanced imaging study, the plain x-ray must be performed after the current episode of symptoms started or changed and results need to be available to the requesting provider of the advanced imaging study. Unless otherwise stated in a specific guideline section, the use of advanced imaging to screen asymptomatic individuals for disorders involving the spine is not supported. Advanced imaging of the spine should only be approved in individuals who have documented active clinical signs or symptoms of disease involving the spine. Unless otherwise stated in a specific guideline section, repeat imaging studies of the spine are not necessary unless there is evidence for progression of disease, new onset of disease, and/or documentation of how repeat imaging will affect patient management or treatment decisions.

For those diseases which occur in both pediatric and adult populations, minor differences may exist in management due to patient age, comorbidities, and differences in disease natural history between children and adults. Patients who are 18 years old or younger14 should be imaged according to the Pediatric Spine Imaging Guidelines if discussed. Any conditions not specifically discussed in the Pediatric Spine Imaging Guidelines should be imaged according to the General Spine Imaging Guidelines. Individuals who are 18 years old should be imaged according to the General Spine Imaging Guidelines, except where directed otherwise by a specific guideline section.

This anesthesia may be administered via oral or intravenous routes. In this individual population, MRI sessions should be planned with a goal of minimizing anesthesia exposure by adhering to the following considerations: MRI procedures can be performed without and/or with contrast use as supported by these condition based guidelines. If intravenous access will already be present for anesthesia administration and there is no contraindication for using contrast, imaging without and with contrast may be appropriate if requested. By doing so, the requesting provider may avoid repetitive anesthesia administration to perform an MRI with contrast if the initial study without contrast is inconclusive. Recent evidence based literature demonstrates the potential for gadolinium deposition in various organs including the brain, after the use of MRI contrast. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has noted that there is currently no evidence to suggest that gadolinium retention in the brain is harmful and restricting gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) use is not warranted at this time. It has been recommended that GBCA use should be limited to circumstances in which additional information provided by the contrast agent is necessary and the necessity of repetitive MRIs with GBCAs should be assessed. If multiple body areas are supported by eviCore guidelines for the clinical condition being evaluated, MRI of all necessary body areas should be obtained concurrently in the same anesthesia session. CT oCT is generally inferior to MRI for imaging the pediatric spine, but has specific indications in which it is the preferred modality listed in specific sections of these guidelines. CT is the imaging study of choice in the setting of trauma CT should not be used to replace MRI in an attempt to avoid sedation unless it is listed as a recommended study in a specific guideline section. Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCPediatric Spine Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 oMyelogram with post-myelogram CT imaging is rarely indicated in children except in certain limited indications (usually requested after specialist consultation), including: Evaluation of spine in individuals with fixation hardware which limits utility of MRI. Severe congenital scoliosis with inconclusive MRI. Evaluation of nerve root avulsion in patients with a brachial plexus injury and inconclusive MRI. Evaluation of paraspinal cyst to assess continuity with the subarachnoid space. Coding note: CT of appropriate spinal level with or without contrast may be appropriate. If the radiologist performs the myelogram the exam should be coded with contrast. If a clinician performs the myelogram the exam should be coded without contrast. Ultrasound oSpinal canal ultrasound (CPT\u00ae 76800) describes the ultrasonic evaluation of the spinal cord (canal and contents) and should not be reported multiple times for imaging of different areas of the spinal canal. oDo not use CPT\u00ae 76800 for intraoperative spinal canal ultrasound as CPT\u00ae 76998 (intraoperative ultrasonic guidance) is the appropriate code in this circumstance. oSpinal canal ultrasound (CPT\u00ae 76800) is generally limited to infants up to 6 months of age because of the bone mass surrounding the spinal cord limits evaluation of the intraspinal contents in older infants. Exception : the persisting acoustic window in children with posterior spinal defects of spinal dysraphism enables spinal canal ultrasound to be performed at any age (see: Spinal Dysraphism (PEDSP-4) ). In general, additional imaging studies of the spine are not indicated in asymptomatic individuals with normal spinal ultrasound findings.

Heredity is also believed to be a factor in some cases. It is the most common cause of low back pain in children older than age 10. Activity modification, NSAID treatment, physical therapy, and/or immobilization with various braces are the initial treatments for symptomatic patients. Surgical treatment is only recommended for patients with disabling symptoms that have not responded to non-surgical care. A pertinent clinical evaluation including a detailed history, physical examination with thorough neurologic examination and documentation of any specific radicular features, and plain radiography should be performed prior to considering advanced imaging. Spondylolysis is best recognized on plain x-rays, and advanced imaging is generally not indicated. oMRI without contrast of the symptomatic spinal level is indicated to evaluate for stress reaction in bone and visualizing nerve roots if symptoms have continued despite a recent (within 3 months) provider-directed 4 week course of conservative care, or if there is a documented need for preoperative planning. oIf additional imaging is needed because of radiological uncertainty or associated spondylolisthesis, SPECT Radiopharmaceutical Localization Imaging (CPT\u00ae 78803) or SPECT/CT is indicated to identify stress reaction in spondylolysis cases which are radiographically occult. Bone scan has been demonstrated to be superior to MRI in detecting active spondylolysis. oSPECT bone scans are especially sensitive for detecting spondylolysis, revealing areas of bone turnover; and the findings are generally positive for a prolonged period. CT without contrast of the symptomatic spinal level is indicated to provide detailed evaluation of bony anatomy, if there is a documented need for preoperative planning. CT scans have been considered the criterion standard for characterizing fractures and for detailing bone morphology and anatomy. Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

A small lateral curve in a skeletally mature person is not uncommon and generally does not require further investigation. Using the Cobb technique for measuring these curves, a curve of under 10 is normal, a curve from 10 to 20 is mildly abnormal, a curve over 20 is significantly abnormal, and a curve > 40 is severely abnormal. Most patients with significant scoliosis have some element of kyphosis as well. oThere are many ways of classifying scoliosis. These guidelines will classify scoliosis as congenital, idiopathic, and neuromuscular scoliosis. A pertinent clinical evaluation including a detailed history, physical examination with thorough neurologic examination and documentation of any specific radicular features, detailed examination of the spine in different body positions, and plain radiography should be performed prior to considering advanced imaging. oStanding posteroanterior (PA) and lateral x-rays of the spine are the initial imaging studies and are used for follow-up. If anteroposterior (AP) x-rays are to be performed, breast shields should be used to reduce breast radiation exposure. oSpine surgical specialists sometimes appropriately request both MRI and CT together for preoperative planning of scoliosis surgery. In addition, MR and CT are useful to identify an underlying cause of scoliosis, such as congenital and developmental anomalies . MR or CT Spine postoperative when recent postoperative x-rays are inconclusive for managing individual treatment. Individuals with severe scoliosis may have compromised lung development. CT Chest with contrast (CPT\u00ae 71260) or without contrast (CPT\u00ae 71250) may be obtained in the perioperative period as well as 2 and 5 years post operatively to assess lung growth. Congenital Scoliosis Cases are recognized in infancy or early childhood. Most cases arise from anomalies of vertebral development, and many are associated with anomalies of the genitourinary system or of other organs. In infants, spinal ultrasound (CPT\u00ae 76800) can be approved after initial imaging with plain x-rays. MRI Cervical (CPT\u00ae 72141), Thoracic (CPT\u00ae 72146), and Lumbar (CPT\u00ae 72148) Spine without contrast are indicated to search for underlying anomalies.

Renal ultrasound (CPT\u00ae 76770 or CPT\u00ae 76775) should be performed, since nearly one-third of individuals also have genitourinary anomalies. oCT, MRI, or nuclear medicine studies of the genitourinary tract may be necessary if the ultrasound is abnormal. Idiopathic Scoliosis Idiopathic scoliosis is the most common form of pediatric scoliosis, and typically has its onset in late childhood or adolescence, affecting 2 to 3% of the population. The following clinical features are associated with an increased risk of underlying vertebral or spinal cord abnormality: oAssociated back pain oAge younger than 10 years oNeurological abnormalities on examination or neurological symptoms oLeft sided curve (concave to right) oDouble curves or high thoracic curves oKyphosis oSpinal x-ray abnormalities other than the curve itself (widened spinal canal, dysplastic changes in spine or ribs, etc.) oMidline spinal cutaneous markers (esp. sacral) such as dermal tracts, tufts of hair, skin tags, etc. oAbnormal number or size of caf\u00e9 72148) Spine without contrast is the preferred study for the evaluation of scoliosis and should be approved when any of the above clinical features is present or if imaging is requested for individuals who are being actively evaluated for corrective surgery.

Based on clinical classification, dysraphism is grouped into two categories: oOpen dysraphism (spina bifida which tube defects (myelomeningocele) oOccult spinal dysraphism (also called closed spinal dysraphism), which includes skin-covered defects (either with or without an associated subcutaneous mass). Normal position of spinal cord In newborns, the spinal cord should terminate (at the conus medullaris) at L2-3 or higher. By 3 months of age, the conus should lie at or above the L2 level. Afterwards, in normal infants and children, the conus medullaris should be positioned at L1-2. Of note, however, in premature infants, the conus medullaris may be located at the mid L3-level. oIf such a finding on an initial spinal ultrasound results in uncertainty as to whether cord termination is low, repeat spinal ultrasound (CPT\u00ae 76800) can be performed in 4 to 6 weeks, since a normal cord will have \"moved\" higher within the spinal canal by this time. Tethered cord Tethering is certain when the cord terminates at or below L4 and there is other supporting evidence of tethering such as limited spinal cord pulsatility, posterior positioning in the spinal canal, thick filum terminale, intraspinous mass, or lipoma. If the conus terminates at a normal position (at L2-3 under 3 months of age, at L2 by 3 months of age, at L1-2 in older infants and children), the cord may still be tethered by an abnormal structure. Such tethering of the spinal cord can be found in some (but not all) patients with Occult Spinal Dysraphism. Abnormalities can be found in both lumbosacral and thoracic regions and are often associated with spinal lipomas in either region. Open Spinal Dysraphism is frequently associated with tethering of the spinal cord; symptoms of or findings from that tethering may manifest initially or may increase after the newborn period and the initial imaging evaluation. See: Open Dysraphism (PEDSP-4.4) . Proprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright \u00a92022 United HealthCare Services, Inc Click Here to Return to Main TOCPediatric Spine Imaging Guidelines V1.0.2023 \"Tethered cord Syndrome\" \"Tethered Cord Syndrome\" refers to symptoms and abnormal physical findings (such as low back or leg pain, decreased or absent lower extremity reflexes, urinary urgency, urinary incontinence, bowel incontinence, and constipation) that arise when a pathologic attachment causes abnormal spinal tension (increased by axial growth), with ensuing pathophysiologic effects. Some of these patients do have an abnormally low conus medullaris; other patients have other spinal abnormalities (such as spinal dysraphism) that causes the spinal cord to be abnormally tethered. Other patients with spinal dysraphism who may present with symptoms or findings suggestive of \"Tethered Cord Syndrome\" may have those clinical manifestations caused by primary dysplasia of neural tissue, instead of being caused by abnormal tethering. See: Non-Cutaneous Indications to Suspect Occult Spinal Dysraphism (PEDSP-4.3) . Not all anatomically tethered spinal cords result in symptoms of \"Tethered Cord Syndrome\". Imaging Studies to Evaluate Suspected Occult Spinal Dysraphism and/or Tethered Cord Plain x-rays are not indicated for suspected Occult Spinal Dysraphism and/or Tethered Cord. Spina Bifida Occulta, an incomplete fusion of the posterior lumbosacral bony elements (present in in about 25% of people), is often discovered as an incidental finding on x-rays and other imaging exams. In asymptomatic individuals it is of no consequence, and is not an indication for further imaging. A plain spine x-ray finding suggesting an absent or distorted pedicle (the \"winking owl sign\") can be indicative of Occult Spinal Dysraphism, for which an initial MRI without contrast or MRI without and with contrast of the appropriate spinal level can be approved. When indicated (See: Cutaneous Indications to Suspect Occult Spinal and Open Dysraphism (PEDSP-4.4) for imaging may be approved: oSpinal ultrasound (CPT\u00ae 76800) for initial evaluation in infants up to 6 months of age, in premature infants whose \"corrected age\" (subtracting the number of weeks of prematurity from the infant's actual age) is less than or equal to 6 months, or in older individuals with open spinal dysraphism (see: Open Dysraphism (PEDSP-4.4) . oIn a term infant, the diagnosis of tethered cord is likely if the conus terminates below the L2-L3 disc space. Of note, however, in premature infants, the conus medullaris may be located at the mid L3-level; if there is uncertainty as to whether cord termination is low in a premature infant, repeat spinal ultrasound (CPT\u00ae 76800) can be performed in 4 to 6 weeks, since a normal cord will have \"moved\" higher within the spinal canal by this time.
