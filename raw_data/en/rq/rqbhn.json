For those who are unable to receive the Body and Blood of Jesus in Holy Communion, making a conscious desire that Jesus come spiritually into your soul is called a spiritual communion. Spiritual Communion can be made through an act of faith and love throughout one's day and it is highly commended to us by the Church. According to the Catechism of the Council of Trent, the faithful who \"receive the Eucharist in spirit\" are \"those who, inflamed with a lively faith that works in charity, partake in wish and desire of the celestial Bread offered to them, receive from it, if not the entire, at least very great benefits.\" ( cf. Fr. John Hardon, SJ, Modern Catholic Dictionary \") How do I make an act of Spiritual Comm union? Like the acts of contrition, faith, hope, or love, there are traditional prayers already composed. However, sometimes we do not have the prayer memorized. In those cases, using your own words to make a profession of faith in the True Presence of Jes us Christ, Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity, in the Most Blessed Sacrament while expressing your desire in receiving Him is sufficient. Can you recommend a traditional act of Spiritual Communion? This act was composed by Saint Alphonsus de Liguori. My Jesus, I believe that You are present in the Most Holy Sacrament. I love You above all things, and I desire to receive You into my soul. Since I cannot at this moment receive You sacramentally, come at least spiritually into my heart. I embrace You as if You were already there and unite myself wholly to You. Never permit me to be separated from You. Amen. Where can I read more about this? Here is a good article. It even shows that many saints made Spiritual Communions. https://www.ncregister.com/blog/armstrong/if -you-cant-receive -communion -make -a-spiritual - communion "}
