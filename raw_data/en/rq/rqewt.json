Here, we address this challenge and opposing effects of exercise and high-fat diet (HFD)-inducedobesity at single-cell resolution in subcutaneous and visceral white adipose tissue and skeletal muscle inmice with diet and exercise training interventions. We identify a prominent role of mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs) in obesity and exercise-induced tissue adaptation. Among the pathways regulated by exerciseand HFD in MSCs across the three tissues, extracellular matrix remodeling and circadian rhythm are the most prominent. Inferred cell-cell interactions implicate within- and multi-tissue crosstalk centered around MSCs. Overall, our work reveals the intricacies and diversity of multi-tissue molecular responses to exerciseand obesity and uncovers a previously underappreciated role of MSCs in tissue-specic and multi-tissuebenecial effects of exercise. INTRODUCTION Regular physical exercise is a well-established intervention to prevent and treat people with obesity and diabetes ( Kirwan et al., 2017 ). Determining the molecular mechanisms mediating the benecial effects of exercise can lead to the identication of biomarkers and therapeutic targets ( Sanford et al., 2020 ). How- ever, this has been a challenging task because exercise is a com-plex physiological stimulus that induces benecial adaptations to different organ systems by altering expression of key genes and proteins. We hypothesize that this occurs by directly impactingheterogeneous cell types within individual tissues and by modu-lating intra- and inter-tissue communication. Here, taking advan- tage of recent single-cell technologies and advancements in computational biology, we address the challenge by simulta-neously investigating responses to exercise and obesity on the molecular, cell-type-specic, and cross-tissue levels.White adipose tissue (WAT) and skeletal muscle (SkM) are among the most dynamic endocrine organs impacted by obesityand exercise, and as such have been the focus of studies on the tissue level ( Gonzalez-Gil and Elizondo-Montemayor, 2020 ;Leal et al., 2018 ;Nigro et al., 2021 ;Sakurai et al., 2013 ;Stanford et al., 2015 ;Takahashi et al., 2019 ). Subcutaneous and visceral WAT (scWAT and vWAT), the two major WAT depots, as well as SkM are highly heterogeneous tissues with complex structuresconsisting of different cellular components. Both WAT depots are composed of mature adipocytes and the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), which consists of multiple cell types including ad-ipose stem cells (ASCs) and a variety of immune cells ( Stenkula and Erlanson-Albertsson, 2018 satellite cells and bro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs); and immune cells(Camps et al., 2020 ;Dos Santos et al., 2020 ;Oprescu et al., 2020 ;Rubenstein et al., 2020 ).

In SkM, single-cell efforts have been limited compared to WAT and the existing studies have focused onSkM cell-type characterization and tissue regeneration ( Camps et al., 2020 ;Dos Santos et al., 2020 ;Rubenstein et al., 2020 ). There have been no investigations of the benecial effects of ex- ercise to combat obesity at a single-cell resolution and spanningmultiple tissues. In this study, we dissect the opposing effects of exercise training and diet-induced obesity in scWAT, vWAT, and SkM atboth tissue-level and single-cell resolution. Our results provide a reference atlas of obesity-exercise single-cell changes in metabolic tissues ( Figures 1 A and 1B; http://scmetab.mit.edu/ ) and reveal key roles for MSCs in potentially mediating tissue- specic and inter-tissue communication changes in response to obesity and exercise interventions. RESULTS Phenotypic response to diet-induced obesity and exercise and proling of three metabolic tissues We studied 6-week-old C57BL/6N male mice with diet-induced obesity and voluntary wheel running exercise training interven-tions ( Figure 1 A; n = 51 across 4 groups). Phenotypically, high- fat diet (HFD) induced, and exercise attenuated, weight gain and glucose intolerance ( Figures 1 C and 1F). Diet did not signif- icantly impact running distance ( Figure 1 D) and HFD mice consumed more calories, especially when sedentary ( Figure 1 E). Each statement is true for separate mouse cohorts studied fortissue- and single-cell-level experiments ( Figures S1 A-S1E). scriptomic proling. For both bulk and single-cell assays, the major drivers of variation were tissue, diet, and exercise, butnot batch ( Figure S1 F). Tissue-level gene and pathway alterations by obesity- exercise across the three tissues We found 1,386 tissue-level differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across all three in scWAT, 562 in vWAT,256 in SkM; DESeq2-Negative-Binomial corrected p < 0.05) and all three pairwise intervention comparisons for ''obesity'' (HFD versus standard diet for sedentary), ''training'' (exercisetraining versus for standard diet), and versus sedentary for HFD; Tables 1 ontology (GO) pathway enrichment and protein-protein interac- tion (PPI) analyses revealed common and distinct biological pro-cesses across interventions and tissues ( Figures 2 A-2D). For the subset of DEGs identied in at least two comparisons in adipose tissues, nearly all (94%-95%) stemmed from Figure 1.

This anti-correlation held for all genes (not only DEGs), with obesity versus rescue showing negative correlationin both depots (Pearson scWAT, p < 10 /C010; vWAT, p < 10/C016), and versus lated 51 genes and downregulated 20 genes, including the fat metabolism repressor Pdk4 (Kim et al., 2006 ) and the muscle- mass repressor Asb2 (Davey et al., 2016 ). Rescue showed more DEGs than training (n = 164 versus 21), suggesting a more robust response of SkM to training under HFD than stan-dard diet. Similar to WAT, training and rescue showed similar ef- fect directions for most genes in SkM ( Figure S1 G). Across tissues and interventions, DEGs clustered into biolog- ically meaningful modules of interacting proteins ( Figures 2 D and S2). Rescue/training led to upregulation species (ROS) response. Rescue/ training downregulated an immune module, including antigen presentation, neutrophil degranulation, immune cell migration,phagosome-related genes, and modules related to ECM and cell proliferation. Figure S2 summarizes the effect of each inter- vention on the genes comprising each module. For example,Cdkn1a , encoding a protein involved in cellular senescence, was downregulated by rescue in scWAT and vWAT ( results reveal specic genesand pathways that may mediate many of the benecial effects of exercise training. Single-cell atlas of metabolic tissues in obesity and exercise conditions In addition to our tissue-level datasets, we generated a single- cell atlas of 204,883 cells for obesity-exercise interactionsacross the three tissues and the four intervention groups ( Fig- ure 3 A). To capture low-abundance cell types (e.g., ASCs in WAT and FAPs in SkM), we used a single-cell library preparationthat enriched for stromal vascular fraction (SVF) instead of mature in WAT and muscle bers in SkM, paren- chymal cells that are already well captured by tissue-levelstudies. We also included lymph nodes in scWAT to capture im- mune cells migrating between tissue and lymph nodes. We annotated 22 cell types using marker gene expression in cell clusters (hierarchical and density-based) of non-linear em- beddings (tSNE and (top 50 PCs; STAR Methods ). These include (1) 3 types of stem cells, including ASCs, satellite cells, and FAPs; (2) 10 types of im-mune cells from both lymphoid and myeloid lineages; (3) 2 types of connective cells, including tenocytes in SkM and broblasts primarily in vWAT; (4) 2 types of muscle cells, including musclebers and smooth muscle cells; and (5) 4 additional cell types including endothelial, epithelial, epididymis, and glial cells ( Fig- ure 3 A). Within each cell type, our analysis revealed subclusters driven by tissue provenance ( Figure 3 B;Table S2 ) and to a lower degree by intervention group ( Figure 3 C). Sub-clustering re- vealed 42 cell subtypes/states for 11 of the 22 cell types,including 3 ASC states, namely showed clear dis-tinctions of these cell subtypes/states ( Figure S3 A). Molecular signatures of depot-specic ASC states We evaluated WAT ASC transcriptional diversity as a marker ofdifferentiation potential ( Figure 3 D). The robustness of this concept was demonstrated in the CytoTRACE framework, which showed that transcriptional diversity decreases during differen- tiation ( Gulati conrmed that IPCs show increased transcriptional diversity, consistent with their earlier differentiation state ( Merrick et al., 2019 ). In scWAT, how- ever, CPs and CD142+ cells showed increased transcriptional diversity, which may be related to their beiging trans -differentia- tion and de-differentiation potential trajectory analysis ( Qiu et al., 2017 ) and selected the starting point of the trajectory (IPCs) based on previous experimental evidence ( Merrick et al., 2019 ). The predicted pseudotime depicted a trajectory from IPCs to CPsand CD142+ cells in both WAT sought co-expressed regulator/target-gene combina- tions (regulons) for each into theirTable 1.

Overall, our sin- gle-cell data highlight depot-shared and depot-specic gene regulatory circuitries for different populations of ASCs and enable regulator prediction for early ASC differentiation in vWAT. Seven distinct FAP states and a novel FAP population in SkMWe classied the /C2455,000 FAPs into seven distinct cellular states using mouse and human markers ( Camps et al., 2020 ; Oprescu et al., 2020 ;Rubenstein et al., 2020 ): (1) multipotent IPC_SkM, sharing with WAT; similar to adipose tissue CD142+ cell ( Camps et al., 2020 ); (5) FAP_post_injury representing an inflammatory post-injury-likestate; (6) mesoangioblasts (MABs), marked by Alpl+; and (7) a previously unreported Sca1 population of FAPs, discussed in more detail below ( Figure S3 C). The rst six subtypes were all positive for Pdgfra ,Cd34 , and Ly6a (Figure S3 D). All seven sub- types were detectable in previous single-cell data ( Dos Santos et al., 2020 ;Oprescu et al., 2020 )(Figure S3 E). Surprisingly, while FAPs are usually dened using inter- changeable combinations markers Cd34+ , FAP population negative for Sca1 ( Joe et al., 2010 )(Figure S3 D). Downregulation of SCA1 oc- curs as cells differentiate along a particular lineage ( Soliman et al., 2020 ). According to CytoTRACE differentiation prediction, Sca1 /C0FAPs showed a more differentiated state (less transcrip- tional diversity) than Sca1+ FAPs ( Figure analysis (Qiu et ) conrmed the of Sca1 pseudotime ( Figure S3 C). Sca1 /C0FAPs ex- pressed higher levels of collagen genes, which are pan-bro-blast markers, and IL33, which is known for its role in recruiting Tregs and ILC2s in non-lymphoid tissues to combat inflamma- tion ( Spallanzani et al., 2019 )(Figure S3 F). Thus, we hypothesize Sca1 /C0FAPs as a population of We validated Sca1 cellsorting (FACS) and gating. We Sca1+ staining ( Figures 3 H and 3I). Based on marker gene expression, this FAP is similar to a population reported in heart (cardiac brogenic SCA-1 /C0 cell) ( Soliman et al., 2020 )(Figure S3 I), which was differentiated from PDGFR a+ SCA-1+ cells. This SCA-1 /C0population increased in post-myocardial infarction hearts with a pathogenic role in remodeling and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. Inter-estingly, there was a trend for Sca1 /C0FAP abundance to decrease in training leading to the hypothesis that exercise training downregulates SkM brosis through its effects on Sca1 /C0FAPs. Marker genes for the seven FAP states were enriched in shared and unique pathways ( Figure 3 J). Shared pathways across the seven states included core matrisome, matrisomeassociated, IGF transport and uptake, and aging, suggesting FAP as a key contributor to ECM ( Chapman et al., 2017 ), IGF al., 2021 ), Ancel al., FAP pathways and regulons sup-ported their respective Figures 3 J and 3K). In Sca1 /C0 FAPs, we found IL6-mediated signaling pathways and the and Cebpg regulons, which are involved in the IL6-inducedoxidative stress response ( Forcina et al., 2019 ), highlighting a po- tential response of this population to IL6 that is known to be released with muscle contraction ( Lauritzen et al., 2013 ). Cell-type and cell-state proportion changes in obesity and exercise across the three tissuesWe also deconvolved ( Newman et al., 2015 ) our tissue-level data using independent single-cell maps rened by manual curation (Dos Santos et al., 2020 ;Rajbhandari et al., 2019 ). As expected, deconvolution captured primarily high-abundance cell types(Table tissue-deconvolution results to char- acterize cell-type proportion changes in our three intervention comparisons. In both adipose tissues, HFD-induced obesitysignicantly decreased mature adipocytes and increased ASCs and myeloid cells ( Figures 4 A and 4B), with and macrophage decline ( Ghaben and Scherer, 2019 ). Exercise training reversed these effects in HFD, even though training alone showed no effect under standard diet con-ditions. Histology staining in both WAT depots showed that obesity signicantly enlarged mature adipocyte size (adipocyte Figure 3.

In SkM, training and rescue decreased type II (fast) myonuclei and increased FAPs, myeloid cells, and endothelial cells ( Figure 4 C). We also used our single-cell results to annotate changes in cell subtype/state proportions ( Figures S4 S2 ). In across interventions, ASCs, macrophages, and T cells were thecell types with the most subtype/state proportion changes. Inobesity, we found changes in vWAT specically, with ASCs showing increased CD142+ cells, consistent with previous re- sults ( Merrick et al., 2019 ;Schwalie et al., 2018 ). Rescue once more reversed the change, decreasing CD142+ cells in vWAT (Figure S4 B). In addition to ASCs, obesity both increased macro- phage proportion and M1 (pro-inflammatory) versus M2 (anti-in-flammatory) ratio in vWAT ( Figure S4 C). Rescue restored the M1/ M2 ratio toward baseline. In lymphoid lineage there was an in- crease of Tregs and a decrease of NKT cells in obesity, changesreversed in rescue. Furthermore, there were similar changes ofTregs and NKT cells in training, suggesting that the benecial ef- fects of exercise training on lymphocytes occur regardless of diet. In SkM, training showed a tendency to decrease the ratioof Sca1 /C0and Sca1+ FAPs, which suggests that training improved SkM physiology and decreased inflammation and brotic potential ( Figure S4 D). Cell-type-specic transcriptomic remodeling and circadian rhythm gene expressionin MSCs across the three tissues We next used our single-cell data to infer cell-state-specic and cell-type-specic gene expression changes modulated by obesityand exercise training interventions. In WAT ( Figures 4 F and 4G; Table S4 ), we found 139 scWAT DEGs and vWAT DEGs at the cell-state level, affecting primarily ASCs followed by T cells in both WAT depots. In DEGs IPCs and CPs are the ASC states most responsive to the interventions. Be- tween the two fat depots, vWAT was affected the most by obesity,showing a 7.6-fold enrichment for DEGs (265 versus 35). In vWAT, rescue reversed /C2412% of the obesity-regulated genes in ASCs, but 0% in T cells, indicating that obesity-induced immune dysre-gulation is potentially longer-lasting. In SkM, we identied 290 DEGs (13 obesity + 74 training + 203 rescue; Figure 4 H; Table S4 ). Rescue led to more single-cell DEGs than obesity and training, consistent with our tissue-level results. Sca1+ FAPsshowed the most DEGs, with IPC_SkM and the Sca1+ FAP DEGs. Cell-type-level DEGs showed similar gene expression change patterns for the three tis-sues and the three phenotypic comparisons ( Figures S4 E-S4G). In the three tissues, ECM-related pathways were upregulated by obesity and downregulated by training and rescue in scWATIPCs, all four states of vWAT ASCs, and three 4 I-4K; Table S4 ).Excessive deposition of ECM has been observed with obesity in WAT to both provide structural support to the enlarged mature adipocytes and promote tissue brosis ( Marcelin et al., Shao et al., ). In SkM, ECM is essential for muscle develop- ment, growth, repair, and mechanical support during exercise. These data support a signicant role for ASCs in scWAT and vWAT and FAPs in SkM in regulating ECM remodeling in thecontext of obesity and exercise. Circadian rhythm is another notable pathway regulated in all the three tissues, which was only observed in single-cell but not tissue-level data. The pathway was upregulated by trainingand rescue and enriched in FAPs in SkM and ASCs in WAT, sug- gesting a close link between exercise and circadian rhythmicity in these tissues ( Figures 4 I-4K; Table S4 ). Upstream regulator analysis revealed Dbp,Tef, and PAR bZIP TFs sharing motif ( Yoshitane et al., 2019 po- tential of these training-altered ndings suggest that exercise training upregulates the circadian rhythm pathway through shared transcriptional regulators in MSCs of the three tissues. Distinct cell-type-specic pathways regulated by exercise and obesity in each tissueIn scWAT, pathway analysis of the DEGs indicated that obesity downregulated type I interferon signaling and defense response in T cells, which suggests a shift from adaptive immune responseto inflammation ( Figure S4 E;Table S4 ). Rescue was enriched in the prostaglandin synthesis and regulation pathway in ASCs, which included a downregulation of the expression of the pros-taglandin degradation gene associated with increased prostaglandin E 2levels, which has been shown to help to main- tain ASC self-renewal capacity and enhance immunomodulatorypotency 2016 ). In vWAT, obesity upregulated and rescue downregulated two pathways may anti- adipogenic inflammatory molecule secreted from hypertrophic, dysfunctional adipocytes and known to inhibit adipocyte differ-entiation in mice and humans ( Ghaben and Scherer, 2019 ). The second is whose intracellular accumu- by adipogenesis has been reported to be involved in ectopic fat deposition ( Jia and Sowers, 2019 ;Reggio et al., 2020 ). downregulated consistent with increased Figure S4 D), which inhibits (I-K) plot) that are signicantly enriched in cell-state-specic DEGs across the three comparisons in scWAT (I), vWAT (J), and SkM (K). x axis of the bar plot shows /C0log10 p value with rescue/training pathways being positive and obesity being negative.

In the immune compartment of SkM, obesity upregulated the IL-18 signaling pathway in conventional type 2 DCs, consistent with the IL-18 in- crease in DCs identied using deconvolved tissue-level data were mostly regulated in opposite directions in obesity versus training/rescue ( Figures S4 K-S4M). The enriched pathways in both fat depots include lipid metabolism in mature adipocytes,ECM-related pathways and IGF transport and uptake in ASCs and myeloid cells, immune cell activation, regulation of inflam- matory response, and monocyte chemotaxis in lymphoid andmyeloid SkM, 44 out of the 50 tissue-deconvolved DEGs were found within fast myonuclei ( Figure S4 M). Exercise training reprograms within- and cellular communication Taking advantage of et al., 2020 ) to predict pairwise cellular communication within and across tissues and interventions atboth cell-type and cell-state levels ( Figures 5 andS5;Table tissues, we observed MSCs function as self- and cross- regulating hubs of immune and non-immune cell types in obesity, training, and rescue comparisons ( Figures 5 A, 5B, S5A, and S5B). By comparing ranks of signicant interactions overlapping intervention groups, we observed networks of differ- ential interactions, including obesity vWAT). RANK-RANKL-OPG triad showed a particularly interesting co-expression pattern change inresponse to HFD and exercise training in vWAT ( Figures S5 A, S5C, and S5D). RANK is the receptor among the three and en- coded by Tnfrsf11a , RANKL is the ligand and OPG (osteoprotegerin) is and encoded Tnfrsf11b . mostly expressed in ASC IPCs was highly expressed in nILC2s and CD27 /C0Tgds, and RANK was expressed mainly in M2 macrophages ( Figure S5 C). Obesity and IPCs and RANKL expression while training and rescue decreased OPG expression ( Fig- ure S5 D). Interestingly, RANKL expression in CD27/C0Tgd and RANK expression in M2 macrophages showed an opposite trend of changes in obesity versus training and rescue. This ledus to hypothesize that HFD promoted interaction betweenRANKL in the decoy receptor OPG in broblast and IPCs, and on the contrary, exercise training induced a shift from this ligand-receptor interaction to interaction betweenRANKL from CD27 /C0Tgd and RANK from M2 macrophage.Across tissues, we performed slightly different comparisons to highlight physiologically meaningful directed communication changes between WAT and SkM with obesity and exercise training. Specically, we compared ligand-receptor co-expres-sion from SkM to WAT mediating the effect of obesity (HFD versus standard diet) in sedentary state or with exercise training. We per- formed a similar analysis from WAT to SkM comparing the trainingeffect (training versus sedentary) under HFD or standard diet. Wediscovered that HFD effect with exercise training downregulated cross-tissue communication from non-immune cell states in SkM to immune cell subtypes in vWAT compared to HFD effectwith the sedentary condition ( Figures 5 C and 5D). However, there is little such communication between SkM and scWAT. Conversely, training effect with HFD downregulated numerouscrosstalk from immune cell subtypes in vWAT to non-immune cell states in SkM compared to training effect with standard diet (Figures 5 E and 5F). The SkM non-immune cell states involved in the two-way interactions are primarily FAP states, while the im-mune cell subtypes differ for the ones receiving molecular signals from SkM with training versus the ones sending signals to SkM with HFD ( Figures 5 C and 5D). MIF-CD74 signaling is one such interaction, which was downregulated by exercise trainingfrom different SkM cell types including FAPs to M1 macrophages and cDC1s and cDC2s in vWAT, but slightly upregulated its inter- action with M2 macrophages ( Figures S5 E and S5F). secreted from and vWAT and corresponding receptors on FAPs in SkM (Figures 5 E and 5F). Expression of AREG secreted by Tregs and nILC2s S5 G and S5H). AREG-EGFR signaling has been shown to play an important role in wound heal- ing by regulating differentiation of broblasts to myobroblastsand their proliferation in many diseases ( Son et al., 2021 ). Based on our results, exercise training may dampen the HFD-induced probrotic effect on SkM through regulation of the AREG-EGFRsignaling axis between vWAT and SkM. More interestingly, although there are cell types expressing MIF within vWAT and cell types expressing AREG in SkM, we did not detect signicantwithin-tissue interaction changes for these two ligand-receptorpairs with exercise, further indicating the importance of cross-tis- sue analysis in the context of obesity-exercise interaction. Genetics of two exercise-training candidate genes in two independent large-scale human studies To evaluate the human relevance of our results, we selectedone gene that was upregulated and one that was Figure 5.

Of the 15 commonly downregulated genes, we selected cell proliferation and senescence regulator Cdkn1a .Cdkn1a is downregulated by training/rescue primarily in MSCs in the three tissues as assessed using both bulk and single-cell methods (Figure 6 C).

The minor allele of both SNPs (C for rs762624 and G for rs2395655) showed protective associa- tions with increased body fat-free mass, increased basal nor alleles increasing expression of a non-coding transcript iso- form (long non-coding RNA, ENST00000462537.3; Figures S6 G and S6H). These results suggest a potentially causal role for CDKN1A in human metabolic phenotypes, validating the human disease relevance of our results. DISCUSSION Our single-cell atlas with more than 200,000 cells and 53 anno- tated cell subtypes/states enabled identication of rare cell populations three key metabolictissues (scWAT, vWAT, SkM). depot-shared and identied seven distinct FAP states in SkM and validated one population of Sca1 /C0FAPs as potential brogenic progenitors. By studying the three tissues using comprehensive and complementary sin- gle-cell, tissue-level, and tissue-deconvolution analyses, we determined two prominent gene programs, ECM and circadianrhythm, both of which were regulated in opposite directions byexercise and obesity in MSCs across the three tissues. We in- ferred intra-tissue communication changes between ASCs and immune cell subtypes vWAT. We inferred inter-tissue crosstalkchanges between and immune cell subtypes in vWAT ( Figure 1 B). With this study, we set the foundation for un- derstanding the molecular changes and cell types mediating thesystemic and heterogeneous effects of exercise on obesity in different tissues. Our single-cell data indicate that at the pathway level, obesity and exercise training modulate gene expression related to ECM remodeling and circadian rhythm in specic MSC states in the three tissues. Obesity upregulated and exercise downregulatedECM-related pathways in MSCs. Notably, IPC is the only sharedMSC state across the three tissues showing consistent ECM pathway regulation with obesity and exercise. Recently, others reported the presence of bro-inflammatory progenitors inmouse WAT depots, which correspond to IPCs ( Figure S3 J), with a brogenic and inflammatory phenotype featuring ECM gene expression ( al., 2018 ;Shao et al., 2021 ). Inhumans the frequency of a similar population of cells has been shown to be correlated not only with omental WAT (oWAT) brosis level but also with the severity of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes ( Marcelin et al., 2017 ). Our results suggest that obesity and exercise training could modulate the bro-inflamma- tory phenotype of IPCs through ECM-related gene expression. Another notable MSC-specic exercise-regulated pathway detected in our study was the circadian rhythm pathway, whichwas upregulated by exercise training across the three tissues. We identied Dbp and its homologs Tef and Hlf as potential mas- ter regulators of the upregulated rhythmic pathway. Dbp is atranscription factor with expression under circadian control (Zvonic et al., 2006 ) and has been reported to improve insulin sensitivity and enhance adipogenesis in pre-adipocytes ofvWAT in mice and humans ( Suzuki et al., 2019 ;Ushijima et al., 2020 ). Taken together, we hypothesize that training-induced in- creases in circadian rhythm gene expression via Dbp maycontribute to hyperplasia in WAT. Our hypothesis is further sup-ported by our analysis of a large human cohort where DBP expression in scWAT is negatively associated with BMI and HOMA-IR. Thus, training-induced circadian rhythm genes inmice and differentiation regula- tors, affecting whole-body metabolic functions. Single-cell data also empowered us to look into cell-cell communication within and across tissues. Our within-tissue analysis of vWAT highlighted an interesting protein triad, RANK-RANKL-OPG. High serum OPG levels have been associ-ated with metabolic disease in humans, while low OPG levels and high RANKL in rodents were associated with scWAT brown- ing,de novo adipogenesis, and improved metabolic function of WAT ( Matsuo et al., 2020 ). RANK is mostly expressed on M2 macrophages in our single-cell data, macrophages known to confer anti-inflammatory and beiging functions in WAT ( Li et al., 2020b ). We propose that exercise changes RANKL-OPG to RANKL-RANK interaction, which could recruit M2 macro- phages or re-polarize macrophages into an M2 state in vWAT, and in this way promote anti-inflammatory and beiging effects. Our cross-tissue analysis suggested directed ligand-receptor interactions between distinct vWAT immune cell types and SkM FAPs in response to obesity and exercise training. MIF-CD74signaling was downregulated by exercise training from SkMFAPs to M1 macrophages and DCs in vWAT, but slightly upregu- lated its interaction with M2 macrophages in the same tissue. Downregulation of MIF-CD74 signaling on macrophages andDCs has been shown to restore antitumor immune response in cancer ( Figueiredo et al., 2018 ) and reduce adipose tissue inflammation ( Kim et al., 2015 ), which aligns with the notion that exercise training reduces chronic inflammation in vWAT through secreted cytokines from SkM. At the same time, MIF- CD74 interaction is known to play important roles in cell prolifer-ation and survival by activating PI3K-Akt, NF-kB, and AMPK pathways ( Farr et al., 2020 et al., 2013 ), suggesting a po- tential pro-survival role of the MIF-CD74 signaling axis for M2macrophages in vWAT. As such, an intriguing hypothesis isthat MIF secreted from SkM acts differently on distinct myeloid subtypes in vWAT and that M2 macrophages are regulated by both intra- (RANKL) and inter-tissue (MIF) signals. In summary, we propose a previously underappreciated role of MSCs in response to obesity and exercise training in the threell OPEN ACCESS Resource Cell Metabolism 34, 1578-1593, October 4, 2022 1589tissues, mediated through alterations in their brogenic, inflam- matory, and differentiation potentials. Exercise, as one of the most effective strategies to maintain a healthy body and mind, is increasingly understood to induce tissue-specic and sharedadaptations in the context of many other diseases beyond obesity. There may be similar exercise-induced alterations of MSCs in other tissues and in a diverse set of disease and phys-iological contexts such as cancer and aging. Limitations of study In this study, we did not investigate additional physiological con- ditions including sex, age, and different training modalities, and our experiments were done using a mouse model and not humansubjects. Our single-cell protocol enriched for cell types in SVFand resulted in limited observations in parenchymal cell types. For the cross-tissue communication analysis, although we restricted one of the two interacting partners being secretableand the interaction being non-integrin, orthogonal data types such as proteomics in the blood and experimental efforts using in vitro co-culturing systems and in vivo tracer approaches will be useful to fully resolve tissue crosstalk.

C57BL/6 N mice were purchased from the Charles River Laboratories and were housed in singular cages at room temperature (23oc) on a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle (6a [ON]/6p [OFF]) in an AAALAC-approved animal facility at Joslin Diabetes Center. The mice were given ad libitum access to food and water and fed either a standard chow-diet mouse that ran less than 3 km/day was excluded from analyses. Mice were anesthetized 24 h after the last bout of exercise and following a 6-h fast, usingIsoflurane and heart puncture. We used 5% v/v Isoflurane (NDC Piramal Healthcare) which was administered with an EZ-150C anesthesia machine (E-Z Systems). Tissues were then rapidly dissected and processed or stored for analysis. All partici- pants of the METSIM cohort provided informed consent and the study was approved by the ethics committee of the University ofEastern Finland. The genetic analysis in UK Biobank has been conducted using the UK Biobank Resource under Application Number21942, ''Integrated models of complex traits in the UK Biobank'' ( https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/enable-your-research/approved-Continued REAGENT or RESOURCE SOURCE IDENTIFIER Software 2003 ) https://cytoscape.org/ R 4.0.4 See quantication and statistical analysis section for R packages usedhttps://www.r-project.org/about.html STAR NalGene N/All OPEN ACCESS Resource Cell Metabolism 34, 1578-1593.e1-e6, October 4, 2022 e2research/integrated-models-of-complex-traits-in-the-uk-biobank ). All participants of the UK Biobank provided written informed consent (more information is available at https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/2018/02/gdpr/ ). METHOD DETAILSAnimals, exercise, and sample collection We used 6-week-old male mice for this experiment. For the rst 3 weeks, all mice were sedentary, and half of the mice were fed achow standard diet (10% kcal fat; ad libitum . HFD feeding was used as a robust model for the development of impaired glucose tolerance. At the start of week 4, mice were further divided into sedentary and training groups, resulting in four exercise training HFD fed. The mouse cohort consisted of 60 mice: 12 in each sedentarygroup (12 chow; 12 HFD) and 18 in each training group (18 standard diet; 18 HFD). Exercise training was done by housing mice in individual cages containing a running wheel. Mice had free access to the wheel at all times, and running distance was recorded daily. Sedentary mice were individually housed in standard cages. All mice had body weights measured every two days. After 21 days, miceunderwent a glucose tolerance test (GTT) after a 12-h fast. Seven days later (day 28), the wheels of the trained mice were locked. Twenty-four hours later, following a 6-h fast, mice were anesthetized Piramal Healthcare) using EZ-150C anesthesia machine (E-Z Systems) and blood was drawn by heart puncture. Perigonadal visceral (vWAT) and inguinalsubcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) and triceps muscle were rapidly dissected and were either snap frozen or processedfresh to generate cell suspension. Bulk mRNA sequencing For the whole-tissue RNAseq, also known as bulkRNAseq, we euthanized 5 mice per group and harvested inguinal and perigonadal WAT as well as triceps. These tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after collection. Total RNA was extracted at the Goodyear lab using an RNA extraction kit (Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep, Zymo Research). 10 ng of total RNA quantied and quality as-sessed by Advanced Analytical Fragment Analyzer was used for library preparation on Tecan Evo150. 3 0DGE-custom primers 3V6NEXT-bmc#1-12 were added to a uM. (5'-/5Biosg/ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT [BC6]N10T30VN-30where 5Biosg = 5' to each sample/well, N10 = Unique Molecular Identiers, Integrated DNA technologies), to generate two subpools of 15 samples each. After addition of the oligonucleotides, Maxima H Minus RT was added per tivation 80/C14C for 10'. Following the template switching reaction, cDNA from 12 wells containing unique well identiers were pooled together and cleaned using RNA Ampure beads at 1.0X. cDNA was eluted with 17 ul of water followed by digestion with Exonuclease I at 37/C14C for 30 min, and inactivated at 80/C14C for 20 min. Second strand synthesis and PCR amplication was done by adding the Advantage 2 Polymerase Mix (Clontech) and the SINGV6 primer (10 pmol, Integrated DNA Technologies 5'-/5Biosg/ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGC-30) directly to the exonuclease reaction. Eight cycles of PCR were performed followed by clean up using regular SPRI beads at 0.6X, and eluted was conrmed using the Fragment Analyzer. Illumina libraries were then produced using standard Nextera tagmentation substituting P5NEXTPT5-bmc primer (25 mM, Inte- grated DNA Technologies, 50-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCG*A*T*C*T*-30where * = phosphorothioate bonds) in place of the normal N500 primer. Final libraries were cleaned using SPRI beads at 0.7X and quantiedusing the Fragment Analyzer and qPCR before being loaded for sequencing using the Hiseq 2000 (Illumina, Inc) in 50 bp single-endmode at the BioMicro Center at MIT. Single-cell RNA sequencing Tissues from 2-3 mice were pooled to achieve >1x10 6analyzable cells (nal sample size per group = 3-4). Fresh tissues were enzy- matically digested and dissociated according to tissue dissociation kit protocols (adipose tissue Cat No 130-105-808, skeletal mus- cle Cat by resuspended in 0.1% BSA in PBS and immediately processed for the generation of single-cell RNA (scRNA) libraries using the droplet-based RNA sequencing technology. Briefly, 5000-6000 cells were proled per sample using the Chromium Single Cell 3 0RNA reagent kit v3 according to the 10X Genomics protocol. The generated cDNA libraries were indexed, pooled, and sequenced in three batches using the NovaSeq 6000 S2 system and reagent kits (100 cycles; Illumina) at the BioMicro Center Core at MIT. Histology Representative samples of scWAT and vWAT were xed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 24hrs and then stored in 70% ethanol at 4/C14C. Five-micrometer-thick tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Richard Allan Scientic) and relative adipocyte size was estimated at 20-fold magnication of 5 random using an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX51Olympus). CellProler 3.0(http://cellproler.org ) was used for the automatic measurement.ll OPEN ACCESS Resource e3Cell Metabolism 34, 1578-1593.e1-e6, October 4, 2022FACS-based cell isolation, RNA isolation and quantitative PCR Single cell suspension passed through 40 um (FisherBrand) and dead cell removal MS column (Miltenyi Biotec) BSA at 4/C14C for 30 min. After 3 times of washing, Cytox green (1:100, Invitrogen) was added as a dead cell marker. Live CD140+ SCA1+ and CD140+SCA- cells from CD45/C0CD34+populations were sorted on Aria II (BD biosciences), and the RNA were isolated using Trizol in combination with miRNeasy kit (Qiagen). 15 ul of elution buffer was used to elute RNA, and we performed qRT-PCR using RNA to Ct kit on Quant Studio 7 (Thermo Scientic) to detect genedifferentially expressed in CD140+SCA1+ and CD140+SCA1-. Multiplex Fluorescent ISH assay RNA in situ hybridization experiments were performed using the RNAscope technology, which has been previously described ( Wang et al., 2012 ). Paired double-Z oligonucleotide probes were designed against target RNA using custom software. The RNAscope LS Fluorescent Multiplex Kit and the probes targeting mouse pdgfr variant 1 and ly6a mRNA were from Advanced Cell Diagnostics (New- ark CA). The RNAscope LS Fluorescent Multiplex Kit was used with standard pre-treatment conditions. FFPE mouse skeletal muscletissue samples were incubated with Leica BOND Epitope Retrieval Solution 2 (ER2) at 95 /C14C for 15 min. RNAscope 2.5 LS Protease III was used for 15 min at 40/C14C. Pre-treatment conditions were optimized for each sample and quality control for RNA integrity was completed using probes specic to the housekeeping genes Polr2a, Ppib, and Ubc. These probes are low, moderate, and high ex-pressing genes, respectively. Negative control background staining was evaluated using a probe specic to the bacterial dapB gene. Fluorescent images were acquired using a 3D Histech Panoramic Scan Digital Slide Scanner microscope using a 40x objective. Immunohistochemistry assay The 5um gastrocnemius muscles sections were xed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 24hrs, embedded in parafn and submitted to an- tigen retrieval with a hot 1x sodium citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 /C14C. Secondary antibodies were anti-mouse Alexa 488, anti-rabbit Alexa 568, and anti-goat Alexa 647 at a 1:400 dilution. Secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room tem- perature. The slides were mounted with Vectashield with DAPI to counterstain nuclei. Immunofluorescence images confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 710). QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Analysis of bulk mRNA-seq data Pre-processing and DE analysis Six FASTQ les for each sample were concatenated for read de-duplication using unique molecular identiers to quantify number of unique reads for each transcript against Ensembl version 98 mouse tran- scripts. The transcript level information was summarized to the gene-level using R package tximport ( Soneson et al., 2015 ). We then clustered all the samples across three tissues unbiasedly to observe potential batch effects and sample outliers. Next for each tissue,genes with a count greater than 10 in all the samples were retained, and differential gene expression analysis for our three compar- isons was carried out using R package DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 ). We used Independent Hypothesis Weighting (IHW; Ignatiadis et al., 2016 ) to adjust p values and adaptive shrinkage estimator (ashr; Stephens, 2017 ) to adjust fold changes from DESeq2 results. We called signicant DEGs at an adjusted p value cutoff of 0.05 ( Table S1 ). Deconvolution We performed deconvolution on bulk data using CIBERSORTx ( Newman et al., 2019 ) and in reference to two publicly available datasets ( Dos Santos et al., 2020 ;Rajbhandari et al., 2019 ): one is a scRNA-seq data in scWAT and the other is a snRNA-seq data in skeletal muscle. We integrated and re-annotated the scWAT scRNA-seq dataset, and conrmed original cell type annotation for the skeletal muscle snRNA-seq dataset (gures on Zenodo). We ran CIBERSORTx using default parameters for all three analysis modules, including creating signature matrices using the two reference datasets, imputing cell fractions, andsample-level gene expression using our bulk data. We calculated expression changes for genes with imputed expression levels in the three comparisons using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. scRNA-seq data analysis Pre-processing, clustering and annotation Gene count matrices for each single-cell sample were generated by aligning reads to the mm10 genome (refdata-gex-mm10-2020-A)using 10X Genomics Cell Ranger software v4.0.0. We proled 317,754 cells across 42 libraries from 93 tissue samples (pooling tis-sues from 2-3 mice to obtain enough cells), capturing 6501 cells per library, 2025 genes per cell, and 45,421 reads per cell on average. We clustered pseudo-bulk proles of individual single-cell samples to determine potential batch effects, and excluded one low-qual- ity sample based on unbiased clustering results. Then for each sample, we removed ambient RNA contamination using SoupX(Young and Behjati, 2020 ) with a xed contamination fraction of 20%. The 20% xed threshold performed the best compared to no ambient RNA removal, automatic removal implemented in SoupX, 10 and 15% xed thresholds, and threshold estimated usingll OPEN ACCESS Resource Cell Metabolism 34, 1578-1593.e1-e6, October 4, 2022 e4hemoglobin genes, to reach a desirable de-contaminated visualization and keep the greatest number of cells. We then excluded low- quality cells using four QC metrics: (i) number of genes with non-zero expression fewer than 500; (ii) number of UMIs fewer than 200 or more than 6000; (iii) percentage of reads mapping to mitochondrial genes more than 10; and (iv) number of reads mapped to Mki67 more than 0. We removed potential cell doublets using DoubletFinder ( McGinnis et al., 2019 ) with default parameters and 3.1% ho- motypic doublet proportion estimation based on statistics published by 10X Genomics. After stringent QC, we report expression levels for a total of 17,341 genes across 204,883 cells. Next we integrated all the 41 samples across three tissues together for an atlas, and samples belonging to a single tissue together for tissue-specic maps. Integration was done without any batch correctionusing Seurat ( Seurat for data normalization, performed principal compo- nent analysis (PCA) to obtain the rst 50 PCs, used the 50 PCs to build community, and clustered the cells using both a graph-based clustering approach as implemented in Seurat v3 and clustering approach in R package dbscan ( Hahsler et 2019 ). Visualization of the tissue- and atlas-level datasets was through non-linear dimensional reduction techniques such as tSNE and UMAP. We adjusted processing steps for tSNE in reference to this paper ( Kobak and Berens, 2019 ). We then annotated Muris sortium et tissue-focused studies in the eld ( Giordani et al., 2019 ;Merrick et al., 2019 ;Oprescu et al., 2020 ;Ramirez et al., 2020 ). For unknown cell type subclusters like Sca1- FAP, we identied cell type-specic markers using the ''FindMarkers'' function in Seurat with an expression cutoff of 25% in either of the two tested populations. We further subsetted each cell type and performed sub-clustering within the cell type to identify cell subtypes/states. We annotated identied cell subtypes/states refer-encing markers from the literature. We distinguished: (a) follicular vs. memory B-cells; (b) M1 (Cd27+) gamma-delta (Tgd); (d) dendritic cell (DC) subtypes conventional type 1, type 2, and monocyte-derived; (e) inflammatory vs. patrolling monocytes; (f) six SMC precursors vs. pericytes; (h) endothelial subtypes ( Kalucka et al., 2020 ) associated with large vessel vs. large artery vs. capillary lymphatic vessel; (i) myelinating et al., 2019 ;Schwalie et al., 2018 ), and a fourth state specic to vWAT (pre_CP), lying between IPCs and CPs and expressing both Dpp4 andIcam1 ; and (k) seven states of FAPs. DE analysis We performed cell-type- and cell-state-specic differential expression (DE) analysis on ''pseudo-bulk'' proles, generated by sum- ming counts together for all cells with the same combination of cell type/state and sample. This approach leverages the resolutionoffered by single-cell technologies to dene cell types/states, and combines it with the statistical rigor of existing methods for DEanalysis involving a small number of samples ( Amezquita et al., 2020 ). The DE analysis was performed using quasi-likelihood (QL) methods from the edgeR package ( Robinson et al., 2010 ). We removed cell type/state and sample combinations containing fewer than 10 cells. Cell-type/state-specic DE-Gs were determined using an FDR cutoff of 0.05 ( Table S4 ). Cellular communication For within- and cross-tissue communication prediction, we exported gene-by-cell count matrices and cell type/state assignment for each cell as two input les for CellPhoneDB ''statistical analysis'' ( Efremova et available repos- itory of curated receptors, ligands and their interactions with the advantage of taking subunit architecture into consideration. We then imported CellPhoneDB results into R, merged interactions identied in each sample, and compared rank and mean values for all the interacting partners of an interaction in our three dened comparisons (''obesity'', ''training'', and ''rescue''). Specically for cross-tissue interactions, we forced ligands to be secretable and interactions to be non-integrin. We then derived log2 fold changes usingmean value, and calculated statistical signicance on ranks using the Wilcoxon rank sum test implemented in base R. Interactions with a nominal p value of 0.1 were plotted using RCy3 package ( Gustavsen et al., 2019 ) and Gene regulatory CytoTRACEWe inferred per-sample GRNs using SCENIC with GRNBoost implementation in ( Aibar et al., 2017 ), and detected regulons with differential activities between intervention groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. We estimated differentiation stages of ASCs and FAPs using the script provided with the CytoTRACE framework ( Gulati et al., 2020 ). CytoTRACE robust, determinant of developmental potential-the number of detectably expressed genes per cell, or gene counts to predict the differen- tiation state of cells from single-cell RNA-seq data. All the QC steps and analysis performed on single-cell data were illustrated and summarized in a gure deposited to Zenodo. METSIM and UK biobank analysis METSIM RNA-seqThe METSIM phenotyping ( Laakso et al., 2017 ). Among these, analyzed 335 participants with RNA-seq data from subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies. Reads were mapped using STAR v2.5.2b ( Dobin et al., as a transcriptome annotation. Gene read counts were calculated using FeatureCounts. We performed transcriptome-wide differential expression for insulin, glucose,Homa-IR, C-reactive protein (CRP), free fatty acids (FFA), BMI (WHRadjBMI). All phenotypes except WHRadjBMI were log-transformed to induce an approximate normal distribution. To improvell OPEN ACCESS Resource e5Cell Metabolism 34, 1578-1593.e1-e6, October 4, 2022power, we included RIN, the rst PC, and sequencing batch as covariates. Normalization factors for library size were calculated using Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM). To perform DE, we used edgeR v3.22.5 ( Robinson et al., 2010 ) with the quasi-likelihoods to t the models and obtain p values. P-values were adjusted for multiple testing using FDR. METSIM isoform QTLTo estimate isoform transcript abundance, we al., ) FastQTL ( et al., 2016 ). Isoform transcripts per million (TPM) estimates from Kallisto were rank transformed to a standard normal distribution. FastQTL was run using RIN, batch, and the rst 35 PCs as covariates. To determine thenumber of PCs, a QTL analysis was run on chromosome 21 with successively larger numbers of PCs as covariates. We selected 35 asthis roughly maximized the number of isoform QTLs. We extracted nominal p values and corrected for multiple testing as follows. For each isoform, we corrected SNP-isoform p values using Benjamini-Hochberg. Then, we corrected the q-values for the number of isoforms tested using Bonferroni.UK biobank To assess the phenome-wide associations of the genetic variants in DBP andCDKN1A across anthropometric and metabolic traits in human, we investigated GWAS summary statistics across 8 variants in the two candidate genes and 108 traits in UK Biobank. Briefly,we focused on meta-analyzed GWAS summary statistics arrays ( Bycroft et al., 2018 ) across a total of 451,354 individuals consisting of white British (n = 337,129), non-British white (n = 44,632), African (n = 6,497), South Asian (n = 7,831), East Asian (n = 1,704), semi-related (n = 44,632), and admixed (n = 28,656) individuals, dened from a combination of genotype PCs andself-reported ancestry as described elsewhere ( Sinnott-Armstrong et al., 2021 ;Venkataraman et al., 2021 ). The association summary visualized with R 'ggforestplot' package ( https://nightingalehealth.github.io/ggforestplot/index.html ) and is available as a part of Global Biobank Engine ( McInnes et al., 2019 ). Other computational analyses and data processing remarks Enrichment analysis was performed using the web server Metascape with default parameters ( Zhou et al., 2019 ). All the heatmaps were generated using R package ComplexHeatmap ( Gu et al., 2016 ). All computational analyses were performed using R version 3.4.0. All Wilcoxon rank sum tests were unpaired and two-sided. All two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey multiple tests were generated in GraphPad Prism v9. All boxplots were generated and displayed in R, using the geom_boxplot() function with default parameters. The median value is indicated with a black line, and a colored box (hinges) is drawn between the 1st and 3rdquartiles (interquartile range, IQR). The whiskers correspond to no further than 1.5 x IQR from the hinge and outliers are omitted. All bar plots for phenotype analysis were generated and displayed in Prism, which display mean values as centers and the standard deviation as error bars. All included microscopy images are representative.ll OPEN ACCESS Resource Cell Metabolism 34, 1578-1593.e1-e6, October 4, 2022 e6Cell Metabolism, Volume 34 Supplemental information Single-cell dissection of the obesity-exercise axis in adipose-muscle tissuesimplies a critical role for mesenchymal stem cells Jiekun Yang, Maria Vamvini, Pasquale Nigro, Kyriakitsa AUC Sed Standard Die tTraining St andard Diet Sed High Fat Die tTraining High F at Diet Figure S1 A weight Sed Standard Diet Training Standard Diet Sed High Fat Diet Training High Fat Diet Interaction: n s BulkRN A vs. scRNA: n s Diet and Training: p Sed Standard Diet Training Standard Diet Sed High Fat Diet Training High Fat Diet Interaction: n s BulkRN A vs. scRNA: n s Diet Training: 1 Interventions BulkRNA scRNA BulkRNA scRNA051015Running Distance (Km/Day)Running Distance Training Standard Diet Training High Fat Diet Interaction: n s BulkRN A vs. scRNA: n s Diet and Training: Sed Standard Diet Training Standard Diet Sed High Fat Diet Training High Fat Diet Interaction: n s BulkRN A vs scRNA: n s Diet and Training: p <0.000 1 Intervention sInteraction: n s BulkRN A vs scRNA: n s Diet and Training: p <0.000 1 Intervention s Skeletal Muscle log2FC Significant comparison number:-20 02 -202-2 2 0 -2 2 -202 0 -2 2P = 1.1x10-10 r = -0.20 0 1 2 30 -2 2-202 0 -2 2-202 0 -2 r = 0.15P < 2.2x10-16 r = -0.36 libraries) dietexercisetissue 0.50.60.70.80.91collection_daycollection_timedietexercisetissue 0.50.60.70.80.91 Figure S1.

The number of genes regulated by each TF is in Deconvoluted cell group-specific DEGs bar plot) that are up-regulated or down-regulated in our three comparisons in scWAT (K), vWAT (L) and SkM (M). The bar plots are formatted the same as panels E-G. A list of abbreviations used in this figure appear the vs nILC2 Mean interaction Figure S5. Within- and cross-tissue communication (related to Figure 5). (A) Within-tissue ligand-receptor networks across the three tissues and three comparisons at the cell-type level. Cell types (nodes) are shaped by tissue (dia- mond: scWAT, circle: vWAT, square: skeletal muscle) and outdegree. Ligand-receptor interactions (edges) are directed, from ligand to receptor, and coloured by effect direction (pink: up-regulated, blue: down-regulated). (B) The number of differentially interactive ligand-receptor pairs that are up- and down-regulated across the three tissues and three comparisons at cell-type level. Each bar is coloured by if the ligand or the receptor is from an immune or non-im- mune cell type.
