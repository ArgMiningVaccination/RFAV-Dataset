It's no surprise that people often like to combine meditation and acupressure into the same activity. They both take a set amount of time and they're both beneficial for your body and mind. If you're interested in trying this out at home, the easiest way to do it is with acupressure mats for meditation. An acupressure mat is basically a pad with several spikes on it. These spikes are closely concentrated like a bed of nails so that when you lay on them they do not puncture the skin. Because these acupressure mats have such similar designs, you can basically use any mat for meditation. If you already own an [acupressure mat for back pain](https://awakeandmindful.com/acupressure-mat-back-pain/) or other treatments, then you can use that same mat for your meditation. If you don't already own an acupressure mat, we have recommendations for you below. Let's jump in! Note: This advice on this page is not a substitution for medical advice. Make sure to talk with your doctor before you attempt any new treatments like acupressure. Acupressure mats should not be used by individuals with heart conditions, high blood pressure, pregnant women, or people with sensitive skin. Benefits of Meditating with an Acupressure Mat Acupressure and meditation are a natural combination. They both provide benefits that are great for your body and your mind. If you're new to meditation, learn [how to start a meditation practice](https://awakeandmindful.com/how-to-start-a-meditation-practice) before you combine it with acupressure. If you're already practicing both, it's a great idea to combine them. Generally, you want to meditate for 20-60 minutes a day. If you're using acupressure for deep relaxation, that requires about 20-40 minutes of time. You can add a bit of efficiency to your schedule by doing both at the same time. Meditation relieves stress and anxiety by focusing your mind and helping to acknowledge and dismiss negative or pervasive thoughts. When using an acupressure mat for extended periods of time, the stimulation will relax your body, release painful and tight muscles, and flood your body with endorphins and oxytocin, which help boost your mood. If you're meditating for stress relief or insomnia, adding acupressure can greatly increase the benefits of your practice. If you use an acupressure mat regularly, you may be unintentionally entering a meditative state. The next step is to consciously meditate while on your mat.

How to Meditate with an Acupressure Mat If you've never used an acupressure mat before, make sure you check out our article on [how to use an acupressure mat](https://awakeandmindful.com/how-to-use-an-acupressure-mat/). As a beginner, we highly recommend that you wear a t-shirt or use some sort of thin layer of fabric between your skin and the spikes on the mat. Generally, you will want to lay on the mat for about 20-40 minutes to reach a state of deep relaxation but to start out try 10-15 minutes and slowly increase the time. Feel free to use accessories like a yoga blanket or eye pillow to make you more comfortable. - Select a room where you have space to lay out flat and can meditate undisturbed. - If you can lay down on the floor, place your mat (and optional pillow) down. Otherwise, use a couch or bed where you can comfortably lay down. - Set a timer, use a [mindfulness bell app](https://awakeandmindful.com/mindfulness-bell-apps-for-ios-and-iphone/), or turn on a [guided meditation](https://awakeandmindful.com/guided-meditations/). - Lay down on the mat by slowly lowering your spine down. Adjust until you find a relatively comfortable position. The weight of your body should be evenly distributed across the mat. The spikes may be painful or feel weird for the first few minutes. - Focus on your breath, repeating a mantra, or listen to your guided meditation. - After about 20 minutes, your body will go into a deep state of relaxation. You may fall asleep, which is ok. - When your timer goes off or your guided meditation ends, bring your attention back to your breath and the room. - Wiggle your hands and toes and then slowly roll off the mat. That's it! You can practice meditation with an acupressure mat a few times a week or every day. You should soon see a decrease in stress and a reduction in sleep issues.
