I am also an actively practicing Midwife who regularly attends home births. I am trained in the art and science of medicine and natural childbirth. Above all, my goal is to ensure my patients receive the treatment and support they need to recover and keep their health. I believe that naturopathy is second to none as an approach for achieving that goal. I have a strong background in the biological and life sciences that deeply informs my naturopathic medical practice. I utilize the best, most effective evidence-based treatments for my patients, while also keeping true to naturopathic standards of care. I also view open communication and a strong doctor-patient rapport as essential parts to delivering optimal treatment. I look forward to the privilege of helping you be well and live well.
