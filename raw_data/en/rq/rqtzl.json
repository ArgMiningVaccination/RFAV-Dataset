Ayurvedic science revolves around the five elements (panchmahabhoot) i.e. earth (prithvi), water (jal), fire (agni), air (vayu), ether (aakash) that goes into the making of the three physical energies - [Vata](https://www.nuAyurveda.com/vata-dosha-treatment-personality-characteristics-symptoms-meaning-imbalance/), [Pitta](https://www.nuAyurveda.com/pitta-dosha-treatment-personality-characteristics-symptoms-meaning-imbalance/), [Kapha](https://www.nuAyurveda.com/kapha-dosha-treatment-personality-characteristics-symptoms-meaning-imbalance/) and the three mental energies - Satwa, Rajas and Tamas which inturn determines the constitution (prakriti). Ayurveda thus offers a unique blend of science and philosophy that balances the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual components necessary for holistic health. Science of Ayurveda Ayurveda is not just an Ancient Indian Medical system, but a complete guide to healthy living. It has been around for several thousands of years and has stood through the test of time. Ayurvedic physicians were doing surgeries and other complex medical procedures long back- while in modern science its a very recent phenomenon. The vedic philosophy believes that the entire universe is one - whether it is human beings, animals, plans or non-animate objects. Hence, there is interdependence on each other. Ayurveda believes in creating hamony of the human body-mind-soul with the surrounding and nature. Hence, the focus of Ayuveda extends far beyond healing physical ailments but to mental and spiritual realms of helping a person attain the highest self realistion. Body types as per Ayurveda Ayurveda believes that each individual has its own unique body constitution like the thumbprint. It is a blend of three body types that include mental, physical and emotional aspects. These are known as ' [doshas](https://www.nuAyurveda.com/tridosha-types-vata-pitta-kapha-ind-your-dosha-body-type-prakriti/)' in Ayurvedic scriptures. These Doshas are further classified as Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Vata represents space and air. It governs all physiological movements like breathing, talking, circulation, assimilation of food, urination, menstruation etc. People who possess this dosha have fast body movement and quick thought process. Vata dosha gives force to the other two Doshas. Pitta represents fire and water. It is the biological energy that functions through organic acids, hormones, enzymes, and bile. Physiologically, Pitta controls aggression, joy, willpower and mental perception. Kapha represents water and earth. An individual dominated by this dosha is ruled by emotions like love, greed, patience, forgiveness, and attachment. It is this dosha that provides the body its physical form and structure. Ayurvedic herbs Ayurvedic herbs are extracted from different parts of the plant - leaves, nuts, seeds, bark, roots and so on. There are thousands of such herbs and their combinations which are available as medicines. The method of processing & extraction also varies greatly - while some are extracted by boiling in water, some are used to make herbal wines and others are used directly for ingestion. Combination of herbs which are described in Ayurvedic scriptures are called \"classical medicines\" while those which have been formulated by pharmaceutical companies are called \"proprietary medicines\".
