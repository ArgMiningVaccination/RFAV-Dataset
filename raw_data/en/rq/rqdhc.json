Key stakeholder acronyms 53 Improving People's Health 4 Forew ord We live in a time when o ur population faces complex health and wellbeing challenges that stem from biological, psychological, economic, environmental, and social causes. The r ising burden of long -term conditions and health inequalities poses a challenge for the whole public health system, and to deal with this we need to address the social, cultural and behavioural aspects of health and its determinants at a population level. The behavioural and social sciences are the future of public health. Evidence from behavioural science suggests that simple and easy ways of helping people to change their behaviour are the most effective. Whether it's encouraging smokers to quit, increasi ng uptake of the NHS Health Check, making healthier food choices easier, or reducing the number of inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions, this evidence can help in understanding and therefore influencing behaviour change that promotes health, prevents dis ease, and reduces health inequalities. We must reach and be meaningful to people in the lives that they are leading. It is time for the public health system to advance the use of behavioural and social sciences , and for this purpose, PHE's Behavioural Ins ights experts, working with many partners, have led the collaborative develop ment of this comprehensive strategy - the first of its kind in the field. Improving People's Health: Applying behavioural and social sciences to improve population health and wel lbeing in England aims to enable public health professionals to engage with and apply the insights, methodologies and knowledge of behavioural and social sciences to their work on protecting and improving the health of the people. As a high -level guide, it provides a framework and consolidates a suite of relevant resources to help achieve this. The strategy was developed in partnership with the Association of Directors of Public Health, Faculty of Public Health, Behavioural Science and Public Health Networ k, and the Local Government Association. This is the start of the process, not the conclusion, and PHE joins all stakeholders in our commitment to use this strategy to create and encourage further collaboration across the sector. We owe all partners involv ed in its development a debt of gratitude for freely giving their time, energy and expertise for the good of the health of our population. Duncan Selbie Chief Executive Public Health England Improving People's Health 5 Executive summary Background and rationale Public health has been described as the art and science of organised , societal efforts to improve and protect the health of the population (1). In recent years the contributions of behavioural and social science s (including psychology, behavioural economics, sociology and anthropology) to impro ving the health of the public have gain ed more prominence. However, they are still underutilised in practice and insufficiently integrated when applied to public health, and the workforce that is qualified to provide this behavioural and social science inp ut remains small. Complex social phenomena and the pressures and challenges imposed on individuals by the contemporary world, as well as digital innovation and system restructuring, mean that we need to enlist and learn from these sciences more thoroughly , and strengthen transdisciplinary approaches (which are problem -based and 'person -centred' ), to deliver effective and efficient change . Scope and potential contribution to public health Many of the problems currently impacting on population health, such as smoking, poor diet and physical inactivity, could be reduced by changes in individual behaviour. However, w hile individual behaviour change is ext remely important, a comprehensive and coherent framework to address these problems needs to draw more broadly on behavioural and social sciences to identify and solve structural and social issues . There is a wealth of evidence that many of the issues that undermine or enhance our health outcomes have structur al, social and behavioural determinants (2-4). This includes the environments in which we live, work, and play; how education, employment , income, and access to health care services are distributed; and our experiences and perceptions of the built and online environment s, social behaviour, stigma, and discrimination. Many of these are also affected by digital developments. In this s trategy we present the contributions of selected key behavioural and social sciences to public health, and the opportunities they present to build on current practice and improve the cost -effectiveness of interventions (Figure 1). We focus mainly on unders tanding and changing behaviours and practices but evaluation is also key to this process and the behavioural and social sciences provide tools for evaluation and behavioural and social scientists are skilled their use . Improving People's Health 6 Transdi sciplinary approaches , where people skilled in a range of disciplines work togethe r on public health problems, could be used more widely . We hope that this strategy will foster further systemic growth in transdisciplinary approaches to public health. It is not intended to be exhaustiv e or the last word , but the start of a process . Figure 1. Conceptualising the contributions of behavioural and social sciences (abbreviated version, full version in Section 4 , adapted from (5) ) Aim, v ision and mission of this strategy The aim of this strategy is to better enable the broad public health system to use behavioural and social sciences to benefit the health of the population. We want all public health organisations in England to make the most of the contribution of behaviour al and social sciences to the protection and improvement of the public's health and wellbeing. We have a vision of a strong and vibrant behavioural and social science community that champions best practice to deliver these improvements. Our mission is to improve health and wellbeing outcomes for the population , reduce health inequalities , and improve value to the public purse. This strategy provides high- level guid ance on how to do this, applying the insights and riches from behavioural and social science to public health practice . The stakeholders, learned societies, and agencies that contributed to this strategy identified 8 priority themes to work on for the future and a number of related actions to be taken (Table 1). Improving People's Health 7 Table 1. Priority themes and actions to support people in developing and applying behavioural and social science Priority Theme Actions 1. Evidence and theory Increase the number of programmes, policies , and interventions that are (i) underpinned by evidence, principles, and methods from the behavioural and social science s and (ii) aligned with evidence -based guidelines where available 2. Leadership of our organisations Make knowledge and skills from the behavioural and social science s mainstream in all our organisations that commission, research, design, deliver or evaluat e public health services 3. Wider s ystem leadership Embed behavioural and social science skills, tools and frameworks across sectors of the public health workforce 4. Access to expertise Assist commissioners, decision makers and practitioners to understand and apply evidence and approaches from the behavioural and social science s to public health issue s 5. Tools and resources Provide a range of tools , methods and resourc es to support the use of approach es from the behavioural and social sciences 6. Capacity building Develop the skills and competencies of the public health workforce , so they can commission and deliver behaviour change interventions and programmes underpinne d by behavioural and social science theory and evidence 7. Research and translation Encourage behavioural and social science research funding streams (including streams that are integrated with other public health disciplines ) and the development of collaborative and multidisciplinary research capacity (with a focus on applied approaches) and dissemination 8. Communities of practice Strengthen or establish vibrant networks/communities of practice, improve quality of service, and promote exchanges of sc ientific information and professional experience Audience and leadership This is a broad strategy targeted at many parts of the public health system, providing a foundation for more coordinated action in future. However, we focus on the information, tools and infrastructure provided by national organisations that support the delivery of public health action by local government and their providers and partners. Improving People's Health 8 A coalition of learned and professional organisations (Appendix 1) from many fields and discip lines came together to discuss and share perspectives, and identify contributions and shared goals. System leadership for this was provided by Public Health England, the Association of Directors of Public Health , and the Behavioural Science and Public Health Network. Volunteer authors contributed content to represent their fields and organisational mandates, which was integrated and reviewed by the group to deliver a co-created s trategy, owned by stakeholders. This way of working has shaped both the strateg y itself and the method by which we will seek to achieve its vision. We do not plan a central governance and reporting bureaucracy , but a collaborative culture of peer-support and coordinated action. Bringing together and applying the many disciplines of behavioural and social science is an opportunity for a step change in public health. This strategy i s an illustrative first start and not a definitive statement of the many approaches that can, and in many places are, being taken . We hope, howeve r, that th is strategy will catalyse an increase in people working across disciplines, especially disciplines they may not previously have considered or encountered. Five key principles for good practice Since this strategy brings together a variety of stakeholders , including people coming from different disciplinary traditions that may have different terminologies, we agreed in a stakeholder workshop on 5 key principles to govern our common approach : 1. We should all use inclusive language that does not alienate. 2. We should all think outside of our disciplinary boundaries and cooperate across disciplines in order to ensure a multi -disciplinary approach. 3. We should promote our common focus on improving public health and reducing health inequalities. 4. We should involve end users in the development and implementation of behavioural and social sciences to benefit the public's health. 5. Our approach should be reflective and critical, informed by the evidence, and involve the highest possible standard of evaluation. Although in this strategy we highlight different disciplines and the contributions they can make to public health, we seek to build policies and interventions in a transdisciplinary manner. We envisage a future where analyses of issues and their aetiology are not disc ipline -specific, but draw on insights from across the behavioural and social sciences . Improving People's Health 9 1. Why do we need this strategy? It is time for the systematic advancement of the behavioural and social sciences. Recently, the Chief Medical Officer argued that persis ting health inequalities and the rising burden of long - term conditions pose a challenge for public health systems , which requires a \"cultural\" wave of public health (Figure 2). She proposed that population health improvement needs a fifth wave of public he alth that will promote a culture in which healthy behaviours are the norm and in which the institutional, social, and physical environment support this mindset. This cultural engagement with health must be embedded and must promote the active participation of the population as a whole, if it is to reduce health inequalities. Figure 2: The proposed 5 waves of public health (6)1 The behavioural and social sciences are essential for maximising health gain in this fifth wave, particularly in an era of digital transformation which brings additional opportunities and challenges. This cultural wave must act on the broader social and str uctural environment that affects the population , and not solely on interventions focussed on individuals, which tend to be less effective, much less cost -effective, and increase inequalities . This is not to imply that the other waves are concluded. There is a wealth of evidence that many of the issues that undermine or enhance our health outcomes have social and structural determinants. This was recently addressed in depth by the Marmot Review (2). Clinical care, while important, accounts for only a minor part of our health outcomes. Preventable diseases 1 We note that many so -called \"lifestyle -related diseases\" are not in fact lifestyles, for instance, smoking is an addiction, and eating too much and moving too little are sets of behaviours Improving People's Health 10 and mental ill health remain stubborn challenges that require an approach which takes account of the whole person and social context in order to be effectively addressed. And wider aspects, such as belonging, identity, social connection, and purpose are crucial. Social and structural factors such as the distribution of education and employment, the built and online environment, and social norms and practices all impact on our health. Despite the fact that behavioural and cultural factors account for a vast tract of variance in health outcomes, they currently attract only a tiny fraction of the attention o r resource that goes to clinical treatment (7, 8) . Furthermore, the tools we have to address the challenges we currently face in public health are changing. The way that people communicate is changing rapidly, and the digital transformation in clinical ca re, prevention, and health promotion is enabling direct interaction with the public (9). Finally, in a period of austerity, approaches based on the beha vioural and social sciences can be utilised to improve the physical and mental health of the population, and prevent avoidable morbidity and mortality across the life course, while reducing the burden on the public purse. All of these factors taken toget her mean that improvement of the population's health cannot rely solely on biological and medical models and sciences, and the behavioural and social sciences have increasing relevance as contributors to a multi -faceted approach to addressing the health of our population. The following examples demonstrate the broad scope of public health topics where the behavioural and social sciences can have a beneficial impact : 1. Examining the positive health impacts of equality and diversity in the workplace . 2. Tools a nd insights to understand the impact of incentives, preferences, and perceptions on behaviours that put people at risk of ill -health . 3. Insights and methods to inform the design of policy interventions to change behaviours that put people at risk of ill -health. 4. Studying how the planning of public spaces can be used to improve health . 5. Identifying how people with mental health problem s can access employment and thrive in the workplace . 6. Embedding methodologies in digital transformation, such as improving how apps and electronic devices can e nhance self -management for long -term conditions . 7. The use of systems science in population health studies such as obesity . 8. The development of quantitative models for policy making that consider the impact of human behav iour on the expected results such as adherence or attendance at screenings . 9. Reducing anxiety and trauma created by crime and antisocial behaviour. Improving People's Health 11 10. The use of social identity approaches to address a wide range of mental and physical health problem s through the recognition of the importance of social groups and the psychological identification with those groups to health. 11. Using behavioural science in market design, to create taxes that are mainly aimed at changing producer behaviour, but may also change cons umer behaviour, for instance sugar taxes. 12. Use of laboratory experiments and other behavioural science research to identify the key role of substitution, from an unhealthy to a less unhealthy product, such as the successful use of e -cigarettes in decreasin g the prevalence of smoking. Each of these examples highlights an opportunity to apply behavioural and social sciences to an issue that requires a solution beyond individual behaviour change . In order to optimise attempts to improve population health , a comprehensive systems approach is required, with evidence -based interventions need ing to be both \"upstream\" (prevention of health issues at population level before risks or exposures arise) and \"downstream\" (individual level interventions , eg, smoking cessation or weight management to address an existing health issue or risk factor) in their approach (10). Dynamically balancing and integrating these 2 strategies is crucial for a comprehensive approach to improving population health . Clearly, these system approaches will often need to draw on multiple behavioural and social sciences with tr ansdisciplinary ways of working. Our vision Our vision is of (i) a public health system that embeds social and behavioural science approaches into the planning , delivery , and evaluation of effective interventions to improve and protect t he health of the population (with s ocial science research valued as much as biomedical and clinical research in decision making ), and (ii) a behavioural and social science community that champions best practice. Our mission Our mission is t o support organisations to utilise behavioural and social sciences in order to improve value to the public purse, reduce health inequalities and improve health outcomes and wellbeing for the population. Outcome Our desired outcome is t he widespread application of the b ehavioural an d social s ciences to efforts to improve and protect the health of the population by the public health sector. Aim Our aim is for a ll public health organisations in England to maximise the contribution of behavioural and social sciences to the protecti on and improv ement of the public's health and wellbeing. Improving People's Health 12 2. National and local context The field of public health currently faces a variety of significant challenges including tackling obesity, reducing smoking, increasing physical activity, improving mental health, increasing uptake of screening and immunisation, reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in order to address antimicrobial resistance, and improving air quality. Progress on these challenges will rely on changing behaviours (individual, professional, and organisational) as well as understanding and changing systems . A systems approach is needed because the complexity of public health means that change often needs to happen at multiple levels simultaneously. Traditionally , public health professionals have worked to change behaviour by informing and educating people (health education and health promotion), as well as making structural changes. In more recent years we have recognised that many of the behaviours targeted by in formation and education campaigns are more effectively changed by also addressing psycho -social and structural issues ( eg, food environments) and other wider determinants of health, These can shift systems towards healthier states, can create new healthier practices, and can encourage 'making the healthier choice the easier choice'. The focus on the individual and the focus on the social and structural therefore need to be integrated. The use of behavioural and social sciences in public health can be trac ed back a long way. For instance, Dr John Snow used geography to trace a cholera outbreak to a water pump in Soho in 18 54 and Dr Joseph Goldberger drew on sociology when arguing that pellagra was caused by dietary deficiencies in 1914. More recently, evide nce from the social sciences was influential in changing legislation, such as securing tobacco advertising bans and introducing mandatory wearing of seat belt s, which has then affected cultural norms. However, to date, the behavioural and social sciences h ave often not been applied in a systematic way. The behavioural and social sciences include a range of disciplines that study individual behaviour and social systems. 'Behavioural insights' and behaviour change methodologies have been gaining recognition over the last ten years. These approaches combine findings from fields such as cognitive psychology, behavioural economics, social psychology and health psychology to understa nd human behaviour and decision making. Behavioura l insights can be used to develop and evaluate behaviour change interventions and the approach has now gained support from key leaders (11). To demonstrate leadership in this area, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) launched 'DHSC Collaborate' in 2018. This stepwise initiative to further develop open policy making was established with an initial focus on behavioural science. Public Health England (PHE) has embedded the behavioural insights Improving People's Health 13 approach into recent strategies including ' From evidence into ac tion: opportunities to protect and improve the nation's health ' (12) and ' Strategic plan for the next 4 years: better outcomes by 2020 ' (13). These state that the behavioural insights approach is a game changer for PHE and the wider system because it deliv ers high value for money and return on investment , and uses a s ystematic approach based on evidence and theory . A range of developments is also happening at a local level. Since local authorities have become responsible for public health in England, the increasing use of behavioural and social science approaches is evident. The Local Government Association (LGA) produced 2 briefings for public health professionals on behaviour change in 2013 and 2016 including local examples of good practice (14,15 ). In 2015/16, the LGA initiated a behavioural insights grant funding programme that was subsequently re-run in the next 2 years ( link). The most recent wave was hugely oversubscribed , despite the requirement of matched funding. Across a number of areas, local authorities have been working to enhance capability for applying the behavioural and social sciences to public health practice. This has been achieved in a variety of ways including employment of a behaviour change lead (such as in Solihull and Croydon), setting up a behaviour change hub (Croydon), and collaboration between academic experts and councils (such as in Coventry and Warwick shire ). As a result, behavioural science expertise has been applied to external funding applications, rapid literature reviews and service redesigns. It has also led to the embedding of behavioural science in specific interventions and the provision of ad -hoc advice across organisations. This work has also extended to the upskilling of frontline staff through a range of behaviour change and communication skills training courses, led by behavioural and social scientists. Competency frameworks have also been developed in some areas to ensure that staff gain the appropriate skills and that these skills are embedded into practice. Although there have been many gains in terms of behavioural science being better taken up by local public health functions , there have been fewer initiatives for building similar capacity for other social sciences. Many local authorities d o commission from, work with , and learn from psychologists, sociologists, geographers , and anthropologists working on public health, but there are fewer resources to provide guidance about where insights from these disciplines could have greatest impact , or how best to work with social scientists . There needs to be a step change in these areas following publication of this strategy. There is an important role for Health Education England (HEE) in developing competencies, and identifying opportunities for training and capacity building. Some professions already include behavioural science in their core curriculum; professional bodies should encourage and build upon this. Improving People's Health 14 This strategy for incorporating the behavioural and social sciences into public healt h builds on recent work by the Academy of Medical Sciences, the British Academy , and the Campaign for Social Science , which has highlighted s ome of the current and future needs across the public health system for the behavioural and social sciences . The roles of behavioural and social science in public health practice ha ve gained momentum in recent years . Some of the key developments include: British Journal of Health Psychology special issue on links between public health and p sychology (1998) European Un iversity Studies Monograph on Health Behaviour and Health Promotion in a Public Health Psychology by Thomas von Lengerke (16) (2001) American Psychological Association book on Integrating Behavioural and Social Sciences with public health (2001) (17) Secondment of 2 Health Psychologists to the government's Division of Public Health (2003) National Consumer Council review of health -related campaigns and social marketing, 'It's Our Health!'

Some of the conclusions from these reports include: \"while much is understood about human behaviour from basic research, there is relatively little evidence on how this could be applied in practice to change the behaviour of populations\" we have a \"limit ed understanding of which aspects of our environments - singly and together - are most important in driving unhealthy behaviours, often without awareness. We know even less about how to create environments - physical, economic, social and digital - to enab le healthier behaviours\"; \"there will be demand for specific skill sets, such as... behavioural insight and change management\" These findings demonstrate a need for a systems leadership approach to embedding the behavioural and social sciences in public health. To develop interest in this and build on the strategic demand, a broad stakeholder engagement event took place in March 2017 at which academics, practitioners, and representatives from learned societies and funders agreed that there is both the nee d and the will to take action. Partners emphasised the need to draw on a number of behavioural and social sciences to deliver health improvements. They agreed that this initiative should take the form of a collaboration amongst researchers, policy makers a nd practitioners with the aim of develop ing a coherent and systematic framework. Improving People's Health 16 3. What can behavioural and social sciences contribute to public health? Behavioural sciences bring rigour and discipline to intervention design, development, and evaluatio n. They use explicit theories and models, which can underpin interventions, and provide a cumulative evidence base of what works. Behavioural and social scientists have valuable research and methodological skills, in some cases these can lead to new avenue s for public health, such as the ability to use large datasets to inform practice. They can contribute quantitative and qualitative skills for evaluation, to understa nd what works, how it works, why, and for whom . As noted earlier, we recommend that public health simultaneously draws on multiple skills and expertise from the behavioural and social sciences in a transdisciplinary approach. In this section we demonstrate how the behavioural and social sciences have contributed to improving the public's health and the opportunities they present to build on current practice and improve the effectiveness of interventions with 2 examples: tobacco control and tackling obesity. Tobacco control The biggest publi c health success story of the 21st century may very well be the reduction in tobacco use and smoking -related diseases . It also demonstrates how the behavioural and social sciences can be usefully applied to public health issues. A broad range of insights and evidence from behavioural and social science s have been used to understand and develop a range of interventions to address this significant public health issue. The interventions have been implemented at various levels, from the political, to the environmental , to the individual, and include informing the population of the risks associated with smoking, so that they would understand the problem, and then: providing evidence -based stop smoking services to support people attempting to go smoke free , providing a national accessible training programme for practitioners, increasing tobacco taxes, banning advertising, banning smoking in public places, and requiring plain packaging. \"The grea test benefits to health are likely to result when social structural changes are combined with more targeted interventions. For example, in the case of tobacco control, raising tobacco taxes has clearly played an important role but when it was used as the o nly tobacco control measure in the 1990s there was no corresp onding reduction in prevalence. The ban on smoking in indoor public spaces has been a huge success in protecting the health of non -smokers, but its effect on smokin g prevalence remains Improving People's Health 17 uncertain. Social marketing campaigns, including No Smoking Day and Stoptober, have shown good evidence of being effe ctive and highly cost - effective. Targeted clinical interventions, in the form of brief opportunistic advice from physicians and pharmacists, and prov ision of stop -smoking support, have led to a su bstantial increase in quitting.\" (26) Tobacco control has also tackled health inequalities, when done in a targeted way. For example, Stop Smoking Services reduced health ineq ualities when they were well targeted to certain groups, such as the sick and disabled, manual workers, and those with mental health problem s (29-31). The Marmot Review concluded that \" Tobacco Control is central to any strategy to tackle health inequalities, as smoking acc ounts for approximately half the difference in life expectancy between the lowest and highest income groups\" (2). Upstream interventions Table 2. Upstream tobacco in terventions and the contribution from behavioural and socia l sciences by 'policy category ' of intervention as classified by the Behaviour Change Wheel (32, 33) Policy category Intervention Contributions from behavioural and social sciences Policy level Legislation Bans on tobacco advertising in the press, on billboards, and at sporting events (Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act 2002) Prohibition of names such as 'light' or 'mild' (Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act 2002) Legal smoking age increased from 16 to 18 years (Health Act 2006 ) Smoking ban in public places, workplaces and cars (H ealth Act 2006 ) Mandating pictorial warnings on cigarette packets (implemented in 2008) Ban on point -of-sale tobacco Social science research contributed to the evidence base that led to the ban on advertising and restrictions on marketing (34, 35). Many studies have shown that legislative measures can increase smoking cessation ( eg, 36, 37). [note: The list of interventions on the left is only a sample of the extensive legislative framework that also includes a ban on sales from vending machine s, minimum pack sizing, and product regulation ] Improving People's Health 18 product displays (imp lemented in large stores, eg, supermarkets in 2012 and in small stores in 2015) Standardised Packaging of Tobacco Regulations (2015 ) Fiscal Measures Increase d cost of tobacco products Research has shown that reducing the affordability of tobacco can reduce smoking amongst young people and those of low socioeconomic status (38-40). Guidelines National Tobacco Control Strategy National Guidelines to support the implementation of local stop smoking services Tobacco Harm Reduction Guidance on E -Cigarettes Guidance for the t raining of Stop Smoking advisors and specialists Training programme underpinned by evidence from the behavioural and social sciences. The website provides an overview of evidence in the area, including recommendations from academic work. Environment l evel Environmental/ Social Planning Smoke free places Designated smoking areas Tobacco products not on display Ban on advertising and sponsorship Restructuring the physical and social environment is a key strategy to influence smoking behaviour. As well as reducing exposure to harmful second -hand public smoke, which already suffices to justify the policy, it has 2 effects: (i) it makes smoking more difficult ( eg, by requiring individuals to go elsewhere to smoke or making the acquisition of tobacco harder) and (ii) it changes perceptions of whether smoking is a normal or acceptable behaviour (by reducing the visibility of smoking, both the smoking behaviour of others and the products themselves). Improving People's Health 19 Communications/ Marketing Social Marketing Campaigns such as Stoptober, January Health Harms, No Smoking Day, and World No Tobacco Day Health warnings on tobacco products The behavioural and social sciences have been used in a range of ways to improve communications and marketing campaigns. For example, the Stoptober campaign included insights about social networks, setting clear and specific goals, and moment -to-moment impulse management. Individual level Service Provision Delivery of evidence based effective stop smoking services Brief Interventions (41) Making Every Contact Count Development of digital stop smoking interventions (42) The English model of smoking cessation is derived entirely from behavioural and social science s with interventions being composed of individual empirically tested Behaviour Change Techniques. Downstream interventions Table 3 . Downstream tobacco interventions and the contribution from behavioural and social sciences categorised by 'level' of intervention as classified by the Behaviour Change Wheel (32, 33 ) Policy category Level Intervention Contributions from behavioural and social sciences Service Provision Organisational Commissioning effective evidence based stop smoking services. Providing evidence based stop smoking services to support people attempting to go smoke free. As well as providing evidence to underpin their development, the behavioural and social sciences can contribute to the evaluation of services and interventions (eg 43, 44 ). Health care professional Health care p rofessionals including GPs providing brief advice to smokers and referring into stop smoking services (45). Improving People's Health 20 Fiscal measures Individual/ patient Incentivising pregnant women to stop smoking Research has shown that incentives can encourage healthy lifestyle behaviours (although there are sometimes issues of relapse when the incentives finish) (46).

Organisations Commissioning for Quality and Innovation and Quality and Outcome Framework Health care professional Payment by results Guidelines Improving identification, and retention across all levels Improving access and referral pathway to stop smoking services Techniques such as motivational interviewing have been trialled and integrated into services in order to improve retention on programmes (48). Development of digital aides to support stop smoking services Advisors from the behavioural and social sciences have worked in tandem with digital teams to ensure that tools are optimised, both in terms of efficacy and in terms of engagement (49) Tackling obesity across the life course Obesity is a complex contemporary public health problem that involves a range of social, environmental, individual , physiological, biological and cultural components . Halting (and ultimately revers ing) the current obesity epidemic requires systemic change by taking a holistic view that addresses the individual, social, environmental , and fiscal influences over the long term . Improving People's Health 21 Strategies to tackle obesity, at a national and local level, include a mix of preventative population level approaches ( eg, the soft drinks industry levy, improving the nutrient content of food and drink at the point of purchase); curative secondary prevention services ( eg, family and adult weight management services); and targeted community asset based approaches. Alongside this, it is imperative to create local places that promote healthier defaults through our built, active, and food environment. Applying behavioural and social sciences and building behavioural insights into the design of these approaches is key, and is already contributing to the delivery of both population approaches at a systems level and targeted individual interventions. Table 4. Obesity interventions and the contribution from behavioural and social sciences by 'policy category' of intervention as classified by the Behaviour Change Wheel (32, 33) Policy category Intervention Contributions from behavioural and social sciences Legislation Restrictions on advertising of unhealthy food and drink to children Helped to demonstrate that children are susceptible to food advertising, with adverts for energy -dense foods leading to an increase in calorie consumption (50, 5 1). A number of advertising strategies ( eg, using popular children's cartoon characters) have been prohibited in order to minimise the impact of food advertising on children's diets. Regulation Front of Pack Labelling Sugar Reduction Consumers' response to nutrition labelling on packaging has been investigated, with demographic characteristics also taken into account to help elucidate the effectiveness of labelling measures. Fiscal Measures Soft Drinks Industry Levy - as a policy lever to encourage reformulation. The evidence package for the levy included behavioural insights about the use of fiscal measures as an incentive for companies to reformulate products to contain less sugar . Guidelines National Childhood Obesity Plan Change4Life Retail Guidance Weight - Management Guidance for Adults The EatWell Guide PHE has developed evidence -based guidelines for retail, a s well as for weight - management providers and commissioners. Healthier catering guidance has been developed that supports buying, making and serving healthier food that also provides environmental benefits. See above for additional comments on front - of-pack labelling. Improving People's Health 22 Front of Pack Nutritional Labelling School based meal standards Start4Life Government Buying Standards for Food and Catering services Environmental/ Social Planning Improving access to active travel Healthy Urban Planning Checklist Removal of confectionary from supermarket checkouts National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) Restructuring the physical and social environment can have a large impact on healthy lifestyle behaviours. For example, changing the visibility and availability of products in retail environments ( eg, at supermarket checkouts) can impact upon sales of those products (52, 53 ). The NCMP, a national surveillance programme that weighs children in reception and in Year 6, was designed to enable management of local efforts to tackle child obesity. It has been evaluated by behavioural and social scientists and enhanced feedback has been tested by PHE Behavioural Insights. Communications/ Marketing Change4Life Campaigns Food Smart 100 calorie snacks Start4Life - breastfeeding The behavioural and social sciences are used to develop effective communications and marketing campaigns. Service Provision Delivery of evidence - based effective weight -management services to support people to achieve a healthier weight Behavioural science contributed to the development of guidelines for evidence - based weight -management services (54, 55 ). Behavioural science is contributing to the development of digital weight -management interventions. Improving People's Health 23 4. What are behavioural and social sciences? What key frameworks do they offer public health practitioners? The richness and diversity of behavioural and social scientific disciplines is impossible to encompass in a strategy document , and there are many more than we have chosen to represent in brief here. Those summarised in the sections below are chosen purposefully as examples of disciplines where there has been , or currently is, fruitful engagement with public health disciplines, and where there are insights which are valuable. It is not any indication or suggestion that those not included here are not valuable or important. Figure 3 shows how a larger, though s till not comprehensive, list of disciplines can inform different aspects of public health, taking a systems approach with both upstream and downstream factors. Figure 3: Conceptualising the contributions of behavioural and social science disciplines Improving People's Health 24 Although we set out illustrative examples of the contributions of different disciplines, our aim is to support the interdisciplinary application of the behavioural and social sciences. Indeed, it is sometimes difficult to say which discipline is responsibl e for a particular approach or framework, so our classification is necessarily somewhat imprecise. This simply highlights our broader point that exemplar applications of behavioural and social sciences do not follow disciplinary boundaries and that our app lication of behavioural and social science to public health needs to be transdisciplinary and issue -based. In what follows, we focus on the contribution of behavioural and social sciences to understanding behaviour and behaviour change, but all of these d isciplines can also contribute quantitive and qualitative methods for e valuation, in order to answer such questions as what is happening and why, what interventions work and why , and for whom . A. Anthropology Anthropology is the study of human cultures a nd societies. Anthropology has made important methodological contributions to public health, in particular through the use of ethnography ( explained below) to better understand the spread of infection and adopting healthier practices. Anthropological appro aches can also contribute to the translation of scientific knowledge into effective practice at the community level. Key concepts and theories The focus on cultures, societies and communities can be applied to digital projects ( eg, in the discovery phase, when research is done on whether users need the service that it is proposed to build and what other services exist). Tools and frameworks Ethnography: a form of qualitative inquiry used to gain insight into the lived experience of individuals and groups, where the researcher is embedded in the society or group that is being studied and observes behaviour in order to develop insights. 'F ocus ed ethnography' , which studies specific beliefs and practices of a particular group of people, has been adopted for work in health (56). B. Economics Behavioural e conomics Behavioural economics takes into account theories , insights, and methods from economics , psycholo gy, and other disciplines (sociology, anthropology, philosophy, but Improving People's Health 25 also biology, neuroscience, medicine) to improve the descriptive power of economic models of decision making. Traditional economics is based on a model of rational decision making. The behavioural economics approach builds on, and departs from , traditional economics by acknowledging that human decision making and behaviour are not always fully rational and optimal, and may be subject to biases and heuristics. It discovers and diagnoses biases through testing the assumptions of the rational choice model, and it implements psychological insights into standard economic models. Behavioural economics can contribute to public health by enhancing our understanding of how humans behave and make decisions (in contrast with how they should behave and make decisions) , thus informing the design of effective policy interventio ns. Key concepts and theories Non-standard beliefs: while traditional economics assumes that peopl e's beliefs are formed in a rational manner based on all available evidence, behavioural economics allows that people may have systematically incorrect beliefs because of biases in the way beliefs are formed. Non-standard preferences: traditional economi cs assumes that people are time - consistent (that they have the same preferences about future plans at different points in time), that they only care about their final outcomes, and that they are rationally self - interested; behavioural economics allows that people are time -inconsistent, that they care about whether an outcome is a gain or a loss and may be particularly averse to losses, and that they may also care about other people's wellbeing. Non-standard decision making and behaviour: traditional econom ics assumes that decisions are consistent and optimal, given a person's preferences; behavioural economics allows, for instance, that people may use suboptimal heuristics, that they may have limited attention, that they may be affected by the framing of th e decision, or that their choices may be affected by their emotional state. Key frameworks and tools for public health practitioners Nudge (57): we can change behaviour through 'nudges', altering the way choices are presented without restricting any options . MINDSPACE (58): a framework t o develop behaviourally informed interventions , including insights from psychology and behavioural economics . EAST (59): a framework to support the application of behavioural insights to public policy , including insights from psychology and behavioural economics . Improving People's Health 26 What is Really 'Behaviour al' in Behavioural Health Policy? (60): a conceptual framework for preference -based policies, information -based policies, incentives, nudges, regulation, taxation, and 'behaviourally super -charged' health policies. Behavioural Insights in Healthcare (61): an quick scoping review, summarising the evidence of the application of nudge -type interventions in health care and considering opportunities for reducing inefficiency and waste in health care using nudge -type interventions. The Behavioural Experiments in Health Economics checklist (62): an Oxford Research Encyclopaedia toolbox to navigate 10 key areas of potential challenge/debate about applying behavio ural economics experiments to health. Test, Learn, and Adapt (63): a guide to using Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) to evaluate policy interventions. Public and health economics Public and health economics have contributed to the design of public i nterventions and incentive frameworks in public and health -related sectors and organisations. In particular, public economics has proposed a fundamental tri -partition of public finance functions into (i) economic stabilization, (ii) income redistribution, and (iii) resource allocation. Economic stabilization is achieved through both fiscal and monetary policies. Income redistribution is achieved through taxation and provision of subsidies, public goods, and social services, including healthcare. Resource a llocation is achieved through direct public provision of public goods and social services, and through regulation of private markets, including price regulation. Building on the public economics framework, health economics has proposed a rationale for pub lic intervention in the health and healthcare sectors in all the instances where those sectors are characterised by market failures, namely: public goods, externalities, asymmetric information, and monopoly. Health economics has contributed to informing th e design and implementations of behavioural interventions embedded within health systems and to evaluating their macro -level impact, including also any unintended spillover effects across different stakeholders. Health e conomic modelling can further help to identify cost -effective interventions and potential return on investment , which is necessary when presenting invest -to-save under the preventative agenda. Improving People's Health 27 Key concepts and theories Market failures : Any time the health and healthcare sectors are ch aracterised by the presence of public goods, externalities, asymmetric information, or monopoly, there is a rationale for public intervention in health. C. Behavioural operational r esearch Operational r esearch uses modelling to find optimal solutions to complex decisions; behavioural operation research is a sub -field that studies behavioural factors affecting model -based problem solving and decision making processes. It evaluates 3 aspects of model -based problem solving and decision making processes (64): (i) behaviour in models (how human behaviour is represented in models and how variations in behaviour impact model outcomes); (ii) behaviour with models (how decision makers use mo dels to inform their decisions) ; and (iii) behaviour beyond models (how models impact upon organisati onal processes and behaviour). Behavioural operational research can help with the improvement of screening campaigns, policy making in the management of long -term conditions , workforce p lanning, optimisation of resources in organisational units ( eg hospital, A&E areas, bed utilisation) , and facilitation of organisational change programmes, to name a few examples (65). Key frameworks and tools for public health practitioners Behavioral O perational Research, Theory, Methodology and Practice (64): an overview that connects together theory, methodology and practice and offers the \"state of the art\" on Behavioral Operational Research theory and practice. Special Issue \"Healthcare Behavioural OR\" to be published by the Journal of the Operational Research Society (forthcoming in 2018/9) , including a review of implementation of behavioural aspects in the application of OR in healthcare (65). D. Psychology Psychology is a broad set of disciplines and perspectives, which range from the study of individual cognition to the study of group behaviours and many more aspects besides. For example, the psychology of leadershi p and diversity is of increasing importance to public health practice. The aspiration underlying this strategy is to integrate the use of science and disciplines but here we discuss just 3 disciplines - health psychology, cognitive psychology, and social psychology - as starting points for public health's engagement with the broad spectrum of psychologies. Improving People's Health 28 Health p sychology Health Psychology uses the bio -psycho -social model to promote and maintain health, enhance the wellbeing of those affected by illnes s and disease, and improve the health care system and support health policy formation. Behaviour is complex and often people are unaware that they are engaging in detrimental behaviours, or feel unmotivated or unable to make a change. Understanding how peo ple think, feel and learn can help us to understand and predict how they will act, and to understand how to change behaviours for better health. Within public health, health p sychology can be used to identify target behaviours for change, create a behaviou ral diagnosis of key determinants of behaviour, identify behaviour change techniques and ways to effectively deliver them ( eg education, incentivisation, restructuring the environment) , develop and evaluate services, suggest low -cost changes to existing in terventions and identify how best to communicate risk. Key concepts and theories Behaviour change theories and models, such as COM -B (Capability, Opportunity, Motivation - Behaviour) (29, 30) take into consideration the dual -process of motivation via conscious (reflective) and less conscious (automatic) decision -making processes including habits, impulses and drives. The Health Action Process Approach (65): introduces the distinction between motivation to change beha viour and the enactment of this motivation, integrating a range of self -regulation processes. Key frameworks and tools for public health practitioners Intervention development frameworks: Intervention Mapping (66), a step -by-step approach to intervention development; the Person -Based Approach (67), a 'person -centred' approach to developin g digital health interventions which combines ongoing qualitative research at all stages of development with the identification of guiding principles that highlight the ways the intervention will address behavioural issues; the Experimental Medicine Model (68) a programmatic approach which emphasises experimental testing of targets or mechanisms of change; Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) (69), a 3 stage process for digital design in which intervention components are screened, refined and confirmed. Combining psychological theories: the Theoretical Domains Framework (70). Building intervention content: Improving People's Health 29 the Behaviour Change Technique (BCT) Taxonomy (71), with free BCT Online training ; Oxford Food and Activity Behaviors (OxFAB) taxonomy and questionnaire to explore the cognitive and behavioral strategies used by individuals during weight management at tempts (72). The TIPPME (Typology of Interventions in Proximal Physical Micro -Environme nts) intervention typology for changing environments to change behaviour (73) Delivery approaches: Motivational i nterviewi ng, a n approach used to increase motivation to change behaviours (74). Networks to support intervention developers: the Behavioural Science and Public Health Network (BSPHN) (formerly the Health Psychology in Public Health Network ) for practitioners and academics, a community of practice for those working within the behavioural and social sciences and public health to come together to share best practice both virtually and physically at regular ev ents; the Division of Health Psychology, a society me mbership for health psychologists trained in intervention design, delivery and evaluation. Manchester Implementation Science Collaboration open acces s elearning website about behaviour change for health professionals, Division of Health Psychology's specialist knowledge database (available from September 2018) Cogniti ve psychology Cognitive psychology is the study of internal mental processes such as attention, language use, memory, perception, problem solving, and thinking. Key concepts and theories Dual-process theories (75): propose that human cognition can be conceptualised as 2 types of processes: S ystem 1 (automatic, fast, and non -conscious) and S ystem 2 (slow, deliberative and conscious). The idea that people often use mental shortcuts and rules of thumb to speed up decision making can inform interventions to support positive health decision making (76). Improving People's Health 30 Key framew orks and tools for public health practitioners Review of cognitive biases and heuristics in medical decision making (77) Review of how cognitive biases affect clinicians (78) Social p sychology Social psychology is the scientific study of how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviours are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others (79). Social psychology is an interdisciplinary domain that bridges the gap between psychology and sociology. Key concepts and theories Social norms: these are implicit rules about behaviours and standards that are socially acceptable and/or commonly enacted by relevant others. Social norms can be descriptive (what others do) or injunctive (what others approve of). Social comparison theory (80): this theory proposes that individuals are motivated to compare themselves with others when evaluating their behaviours, attitudes and opinions, and to adj ust behaviour accordingly. Social learning t heory (81): this theory suggests that individuals learn behaviours via observational learning of others performing the behaviour. Theory of reasoned a ction (82, 83 ): this theory sees intention as the main determinant of behaviour and, in turn, intention is determined by a person's attitudes towards that behaviour and the subjective norms of influential people and groups that could influence those attitudes. Theory of planned b ehaviour (84): this theory builds on the theory of reasoned a ction by including the individual's perceived behavioural control over the outcome as a factor influencing the probability of undertakin g a behaviour. Key frameworks and tools for public health practitioners Behaviour -centred d esign (85): unites the latest findings about how brains learn with a practical set of steps and tools to design successful behaviour change program mes. Improving People's Health 31 E. Sociology Sociology examines the individual's social action (agency) and the community's social and physical context (structure). The focus lies predominantly on the context in which people live, interact, work, and play (rather than on the individual , which is the focus of psychological disciplines).The influence of social class on health status, health behaviou r, and access to and use of health services, is one of the earliest and most examined social influences on health . Key concepts and theories Social determi nants approach to public health (86 ): public health programmes that intend to address social determinants and to have a great impact on health equity. Social practice t heory (87): the study of social practices and how t hey change over time, incorpora ting an understanding of both individual human agency and the s ocial structures that individuals act within . Normalisation process t heory (88): this theory is concerned with factors that promote or inhibit the implementation of complex interventions, from early implementation up to the complete integration (or normalisation) of the intervention into everyday practice. It can be useful for developing and evalu ating interventions. Social model of h ealth (89): this model depicts the relationship between the individual, the contexts in which they live ( ie, from social communities to wider socioeconomic and structural factors), and their health. Key fra meworks and tools for public health practitioners ISM Model (90, 91 ): a practical tool for designing effective policy interventions, bringing together Individual, Social, and Material factors that affect behaviour.. Social Model of Health (92): this mode l depicts the relationship between the individual, the contexts in which they live ( ie, from social communities to wider socioeconomic and structural factors), and their health. Improving People's Health 32 F. Other useful public health t ools Intervention design, implementation, and reporting Behaviour Change Wheel (32, 33 ) o The Behaviour Change Wheel is a synthesis of 19 frameworks from multiple domains, sectors and disciplines. It includes COM -B at the hub (capability, opportunity, motivation as influencing factors in a model of behaviour) , surrounded by 'intervention fu nctions' to deliver behaviour change techniques (BCTs) and categories' as the outer of guide PARiHS framework for imple menting research i nto practice Health Behaviour Change Competency framework Lifeguide for creation of interactive web -based interventions NIHR/CIHR Guidance on taking context into account in population health research (forthcoming) Evaluation MRC Guidance on developing and evaluating complex interventions MRC Guidance on process evaluation of complex interventions MRC Guidance on natur al experimental evaluations The Magenta Book - HM Treasury guidance on evaluation PHE R esources for Evaluation in Health and Wellbeing Frameworks for evaluability assessment Improving People's Health 33 5. Leadership and delivery organisations Leadership is vital to enhance the delivery of the behavioural and social sciences in the public health system and to embed transdisciplinary approaches. Without a concerted and systematic drive, strengthening practitioners' capability within the system is likely to be patchy and sporadic. As an initial step, this strategy focuses on the national public sector players, but we recognise that many others - voluntary and community organisations, employers, private sector agencies , faith communities, and more - have a very important part to play . The key stakeholders that contributed to discussions about this strategy, who are acknowledged in the appendix, are grouped as follows: National policy and delivery organisations National professional societies, learned bodies, and networks Research fun ders, thought leaders , and think tanks Royal Colleges and Academies The infographic below proposes a systems map of these stakeholders and their primary role in delivering or enabling the use of the behavioural and social sciences in public health (Figure 4). Figure 4. System map of key stakeholders enabling the use of behavioural and social sciences in public health in England Improving People's Health 34 6. The first steps to implementation and a road map The road map and first steps to implementation, described below, were identifi ed, compiled and enhanced through workshops and collaborative working amongst stakeholders. Activities for the road map were categorised into 8 areas of focus. The first steps to implementation are outlined in a timeline for the first 2 years after launch of the strategy in September 2018 (Table 5). We recognise that while broad, the list of stakeholders, the road map, and the first steps to implementation are not fully comprehensive and therefore will be jointly reviewed and appropriately updated. 1.

Theory of C hange for this strategy We developed a Theory of Change and associated logic model for this strategy, given that this document was collaboratively developed as a system -level intervention (Figure 5). The logic model outlines the impact we expect to see if this strategy is impleme nted as described and the mechanism of action (outputs and processes) by which we expect the impact to be achieved. This will guide the high -level management of the implementation of the strategy, though we expect individual leadership and delivery organis ations to develop and manage their own strategies in alignment with this co - produced consensus guide. The logic model will also guide the proposed survey of behavioural and social sciences in practice in year one, the assessment of the number of organisati ons subscribed to the strategy that is proposed for year 2, and the evaluation of the strategy.
