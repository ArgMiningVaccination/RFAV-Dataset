Hi, this is Robert Kachko from New York and Stamford Centers for Integrative Medicine. I want to spend some time today discussing with you the role of the immune system and long-term sustainable health. Our immune system is deeply connected to every other system in our body, including our nervous, cardiovascular, and digestive systems. Much of our immune system response begins in our gut. That's where our immune system learns how to deal with the outside world appropriately. What are the health issues related to the immune system? An immune system that can be over or underactive can cause many symptoms. For example, an overactive immune system can cause autoimmune diseases like joint pain, lupus, or allergies. This includes reactions to any food that we eat or environmental substances we're exposed to. In the same way, an underactive immune system can lead to frequent colds, infections that won't resolve, and sometimes even cancer. We need our immune system to help us prevent these types of long-term chronic issues. What are the treatments available? At our clinic, we take a thorough, comprehensive approach which almost always begins with testing. There are blood work and functional medicine tests that we can do to assess the factors like immune deficiencies, nutrient deficiencies, inflammatory and oxidative cascades, and overactivity of the immune system, including things like autoimmune disease checks. During your thorough whole health assessment, we take a very careful history to understand whether your immune system may play a role in your long-term health. Then one of our clinicians will personally recommend a nutrition plan, high-dose nutrients, botanical medicines, IV therapies, and many other treatments like mind-body medicine techniques, acupuncture, physical medicine, and exercise. Our goal is to help you achieve long-term sustainable well-being, and in supporting your immune system, you'll be that much closer to doing so on your journey toward optimal health. Make an appointment with us today to make your immune system strong. "}
