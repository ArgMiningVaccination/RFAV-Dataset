But using natural remedies might also help your [flare-up symptoms](/crohns/how-to-manage-crohns-flare). Curious about using [alternative medicine](/health/alternative-medicine-therapies-explained) and other natural treatments? Here's what science has to say about the most common natural remedies for [Crohn's disease](/health/raechelle-bright). Natural remedies for Crohn's disease There's still no cure for [Crohn's](/crohns/symptoms-in-women) (yet!). But these natural remedies and tips might help ward off or soothe symptoms of a flare-up: - Avoiding triggers - Low fiber diet - Mindfulness and stress relief - Probiotics - Prebiotics - Fish oil - Curcumin - Bromelain - Thunder god vine - Aloe vera - Apple cider vinegar - Essential oils - Acupuncture - Biofeedback 1. Steer clear of triggers It's no secret that certain things are more likely to trigger a Crohn's attack. That doesn't mean your condition is your fault, BTW. But it *does* mean you can often help ease [symptoms](/health/crohns-disease-rash) with a few lifestyle tweaks. When possible, steer clear of these [known triggers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK436021/): - nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like [smoking](/happiness/resolutions-quit-smoking) [stress](/happiness/23-scientifically-backed-ways-reduce-stress-right-now)(easier said than done, we know!) 2. Be kind to your GI with your diet choices When you're living with Crohn's, [food](/crohns/best-foods-to-eat) can feel more like a foe than a friend. But good ol' [Hippocrates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC318470/) was onto something when he said \"Let food be thy medicine.\" There's no one-size-fits-all [Crohn's disease diet](/health/crohns-disease-diet), but [experts](https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/diet-and-nutrition/what-should-i-eat) offer these tips for going easy on your gut: - Eat 4-6 small daily meals instead of overloading your GI with 2-3 feasts. [Drink lots of water](/fitness/how-much-water-should-you-drink-while-exercising-infographic/)during and between meals. - Keep food prep simple and light (aka, [grill](/eat/how-to-grill-for-beginners-bbq-guide/)your [fish](/health/superfood-salmon)instead of frying it). - Dial down your consumption of [caffeine](/discover/daily-caffeine-intake), [alcohol](/eat/recipe/non-alcoholic-cocktail-recipes), [lactose](/health/lactose-free-diet), and spices. - Go easy on the [fiber](https://greatist.com/health/fiber)when you're experiencing a Crohn's flare. 3. Tune in and chill out Have you ever noticed how easily mental [stress](/health/can-stress-make-you-sick/) can lead to a [headache](/health/what-causes-headaches) or upset stomach? The mind-body connection is real, y'all. The [Crohn's & Colitis Foundation](https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/complementary-medicine/mind-body-therapies) suggests that mind-body therapies can help folks living with Crohn's disease. A few ideas: 4. Try probiotics Crohn's disease can mess up the balance of good and bad bacteria in your gut. And when the bad bacteria take over, you can experience everything from [bloating](/health/foods-to-reduce-bloating) and [diarrhea](/health/what-to-eat-when-you-have-diarrhea) to painful [constipation](/live/how-to-relieve-constipation). Since a balanced gut is so critical to proper digestion, some folks with Crohn's take [probiotic](/eat/what-are-probiotics-and-prebiotics) supplements or nosh on [probiotic-rich kimchi - sauerkraut - kefir - kombucha More research is needed to prove the benefits of probiotic intake for Crohn's, but [some evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1856223/) suggests that [probiotics](/health/should-i-take-a-probiotic) help folks feel better in the early stages of the disease. 5. Or prebiotics [Prebiotics](/crohns/probiotics-vs-prebiotics) help probiotics thrive. So incorporating more prebiotics into your diet is like offering backup to the good gut bacteria. One tiny, [3-week study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16162680/) of folks with Crohn's found that ingesting 15 grams of oligofructose and inulin (2 prebiotics) each day led to a significant reduction in disease [symptoms](/crohns/symptoms-in-women). More research is needed, but this small study seems promising. You can boost your intake with these [prebiotic-rich Just make sure you talk to your doctor before adding any probiotic *or* prebiotic supplements to your diet. 6. Snag some fish oil Fish oil is brimming with anti-inflammatory [omega-3 fatty acids](/health/omega-3-types). That's why [experts](https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/complementary-medicine/supplements) frequently recommend it for folks with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) like Crohn's. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4097150/) from 2014 (throwback to Disney's OG \"Frozen\"!) suggested that fish oil could help reduce symptoms of Crohn's. A 2019 [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6801729/) review also suggested [omega fatty acids](/health/omega-3) for soothing IBD \u2014 but the researchers concluded that more research is necessary to pinpoint the best dose and delivery. As with any supplement, it's best to check with your doc before popping [fish oil capsules](/health/omega-3-supplement). Plus, fish oil can interfere with some prescription meds. 7. Give curcumin a try Curcumin gives the spice [turmeric](/health/superfood-turmeric) its [anti-inflammatory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5664031/) powers. Since Crohn's is an inflammatory condition, some folks take curcumin to help soothe their angry intestines. A 2019 [research review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6514688/) concluded that curcumin *may* play a future role in dialing down GI [inflammation](/health/inflammation). The researchers ultimately said more studies are needed. In 2020, a [study](https://academic.oup.com/ecco-jcc/article/14/12/1693/5837560) of Crohn's patients in Japan found that taking 360 milligrams a day for 12 weeks led to significant healing of anal lesions. That's a #win for anyone living with IBD. Science is still unclear on exactly how and how much [curcumin](/health/turmeric-side-effects) can help with Crohn's. If you're curious about trying [curcumin supplements](/health/best-turmeric-supplements) for Crohn's, run it past your doctor first. 8. Bring on the bromelain [Bromelain](/health/bromelain) is a natural enzyme found in [pineapples](/health/superfood-pineapple) peeps take bromelain supplements to soothe [sensitive stomachs](/health/sensitive-stomach) or relieve [diarrhea](/health/chronic-diarrhea/). Research seems promising \u2014 but it's important to know that [studies](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/bromelain) so far have been done on animals, not humans. One 2017 [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5686092/), for instance, found that bromelain improved IBD symptoms in rats. 9. Thunder god vine, anyone? Thunder god vine, thunder duke vine, Tripterygium wilfordii ... Whatever you call it, this herb [might be](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/thunder-god-vine) a helpful remedy for Crohn's disease. In one older [research review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367210/), scientists found that taking thunder god vine supplements helped [Crohn's disease](/crohns/crohns-disease-life-expectancy) patients prevent relapses after surgical intervention. Because the research is so slim, it's important to talk with your doctor about taking this herb for [Crohn's disease](/crohns/crohns-disease-eyes). 10. Experiment with aloe vera [Aloe vera](/health/aloe-vera-for-face) \u2014 so cool, so fresh, so soothing. It's got a reputation for calming [psoriasis](/psoriasis/psoriasis-aloe-vera) and [eczema](/eczema/aloe-vera-for-eczema), but what about Crohn's? Recent [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8668319/) on animals suggests that rectal application of aloe vera extract (yep, we're talkin' suppositories) could reduce inflammation and promote healing during a flare-up. But we still need more research on humans to know the full effect. 11. Consider ACV [Apple cider vinegar](/grow/apple-cider-vinegar-benefits#benefits-of-acv) (ACV) has been waaaaaay overhyped as a cure for everything from [dandruff](https://greatist.com/health/apple-cider-vinegar-hair) to warts. And now we're suggesting it as a natural remedy against an incurable GI disease?! Here's the thing: ACV is not going to cure Crohn's. It *might* not even soothe your symptoms. But a 2016 [animal study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26795553/) did find that ingesting vinegar might boost good gut bacteria and lead to lower levels of inflammation. This might help ward off nasty Crohn's flares. Evidence is pretty slim and preliminary, but there's probably no harm in shaking up an [ACV dressing](/eat/how-to-use-apple-cider-vinegar#1) for your lunchtime [salad](/eat/healthy-salad-dressing-recipes). 12. Reach for patchouli, lavender, and peppermint essential oils TBH, there's not a ton of research on using [essential oils for Crohn's disease](/crohns/crohns-disease-essential-oils), but some folks use them to ease symptoms via aromatherapy or massage. If you do want to use essential oils, research shows these ones *might* help (just note research is mostly from animal studies and not real-life essential oil use): [Patchouli](https://www.healthline.com/health/patchouli-oil). [Animal research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5525581/)from 2017 oil successfully soothes inflammation related to digestive woes like colitis and ulcers. [Lavender](/health/lavender-oil-for-anxiety). Recent [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8107818/)confirms that lavender oil helps reduce inflammation and damage to colon tissue in mice. Though existing studies are on animals instead of humans, we *do* know that lavender can also [soothe stress and anxiety](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31655395/), common Crohn's triggers. [Peppermint](/health/peppermint-oil-for-hair). [Research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29372567/)suggests that peppermint oil can dial down IBD-related GI probs. As with other natural remedies, talk with your doc before adding [essential oils](/health/best-essential-oils-how-to-buy-essential-oils/) to your treatment plan. You should also NEVER ingest essential oils. If you get the A-OK to add essential oils to your Crohn's treatment plan, [diffusing](/discover/best-essential-oil-diffuser/) or topically applying essential oils that are diluted in a carrier oil is the way to go. While research suggests there are health benefits, the FDA doesn't monitor or regulate the purity or quality of essential oils. It's important to talk with your healthcare provider before you begin using essential oils and be sure to research the quality of a brand's products. Always do a [patch test](/health/patch-test) before trying a new essential oil. 13. Try acupuncture You might think it's balderdash, but yes, [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4036643/) suggests that [acupuncture](/live/acupuncture-science-behind-it) does relieve pain. And that [might include](https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/blog/acupuncture-inflammatory-bowel-disease) abdominal pain or other irritation and [inflammation from Crohn's](/health/cbd-for-ibd). TBH, there just aren't enough studies to confirm if, when, and how much [acupuncture](/health/acupuncture-for-weight-loss) can help with Crohn's symptoms \u2014 but anecdotal accounts say it might be worth a shot. 14. Incorporate biofeedback [Biofeedback](/health/alternative-medicine-therapies-explained#biofeedback) is a type of therapy that teaches you to control your body's involuntary processes: - skin temperature [blood pressure](/live/6-natural-ways-to-treat-high-blood-pressure) - heart rate [muscle tension](/eat/foods-for-sore-muscles) - and even [heart rate](https://greatist.com/fitness/heart-rate-zones) Researchers still aren't sure exactly how biofeedback works. But the key takeaway is that for some folks with chronic conditions, it [does work](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27333731) to help them manage symptoms. What's the tea on THC? Some folks with Crohn's use medical [cannabis](/play/myths-about-marijuana) or [CBD](/discover/best-cbd-oils) to manage their symptoms. [Limited research](https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/complementary-medicine/medical-cannabis) suggests that compounds of the cannabis plant can dial down: That said, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has *not* approved medical cannabis as a treatment for Crohn's disease. And we need more research to understand the link between cannabis and IBD. For now, consider the laws in your area and talk with your doctor before trying [weed](/play/myths-about-marijuana) or [CBD](/health/cbd-benefits) for Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease isn't just a pain. It can lead to serious GI damage, including bowel obstructions and ulcers. While natural remedies can help soothe symptoms, it's important to work with a doctor to help manage your condition with a long-term treatment plan. And if you notice new or worsening symptoms (hello, fiery diarrhea that doesn't respond to meds), it's time to make another appointment with your doctor or gastroenterologist. "}
