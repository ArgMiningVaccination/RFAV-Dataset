Eligible Project Directors/Principal Investigators: Individuals with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the contact PD/PI are invited to work with their institution/organization and mentor to develop an application for support. NOTE: CDC does not make awards to individuals directly. The purpose of the NCIPC Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to provide support for an intensive, supervised (mentored) career development experience in violence prevention research leading to research independence. NCIPC supports K01 grants to help ensure the availability of an adequate number of trained scientists to address critical public health research questions to prevent violence and injury: Applicant contact PD/PIs must have a qualifying (relevant to the field of study) research or health- professional doctoral or medical degree (specifically PhD, ScD, DO, DrPH, MD, DVMD, PharmD, DDS, DMD), from an accredited institution of higher learning. Applications that do not demonstrate that the contact PD/PI has a qualifying (relevant to the field of study) research or health professional doctoral or medical degree (specifically PhD, ScD, DO, DrPH, MD, DVMD, PharmD, DDS, DMD) from an accredited institution of higher learning, as evidenced by their SF-424 Biographical Sketch, will be considered nonresponsive and will not be forwarded for peer review. Page 6 of 61 At the time of the NOFO application due date, applicant contact PD/PIs must have less than five years of post-graduate research experience as a researcher in the violence prevention field, as documented on the contact PD/PI's SF-424 Biographical Sketch. The 5-year period will be calculated from the completion of the qualifying degree (e.g., a research or health-professional doctoral or medical degree [specifically PhD, ScD, DO, DrPH, MD, DVMD, PharmD, DDS, DMD] from an accredited institution of higher learning). The Positions and Employment section of SF-424 Biographical Sketch is expected to clearly document all of the contact PD/PI's relevant research experience. Applications that do not demonstrate that the contact PD/PI has less than five years of post-graduate experience as a researcher in the violence prevention field, as evidenced by their SF-424 Biographical Sketch, will be considered nonresponsive to the NOFO and will not be forwarded for peer review. Time periods for significant breaks in employment or employment in areas unrelated to violence prevention should be clearly documented. Only the years where any violence prevention research was conducted after the completion of the qualifying degree will count towards the limit of five years of research experience. Research conducted during undergraduate or pre-graduate training does not count towards the five-year research time - even if the applicant contact PD/PI authored or co-authored a paper relevant to the research prior to completion of the qualifying degree. This funding opportunity may support individuals who propose to train in a new field or individuals who have had a hiatus in their research career because of illness or pressing family circumstances. Applicant contact PD/PIs who are changing their career trajectory to violence prevention must clearly document the start date of their post- graduate emphasis in violence prevention in their SF-424 Biographical Sketch and must clearly demonstrate that they have less than five years of post-graduate experience as a researcher in the violence prevention field. Applications from contact PD/PIs who completed their qualifying degree prior to January 5, 2018 and do not clearly document their relevant post-graduate research experience in violence prevention (including breaks in employment or research in other areas) will be considered nonresponsive to the NOFO and will not be forwarded for peer review. Individuals who are identified as the contact PD/PI on a current and/or former CDC or National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant or cooperative agreement award from any of the following excluded independent research assistance mechanisms defined below, as documented by their eRA Commons PD/PI Grant History profile, are NOT eligible for funding under this NOFO.

Funding Opportunity Description Statutory Authority Section 301 (a) [42 U.S.C. 241(a)] of the Public Health Service Act, and Section 391 (a) [42 U.S.C. 280 b(a)] of the Public Health Service Act, as Amended. 1. Background and Purpose Background Child abuse and neglect, youth violence, teen dating violence, and sexual violence are major public health issues impacting children and youth. The mission of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) is to prevent injuries and violence through surveillance, research and evaluation, and prevention action. CDC's NCIPC uses the same scientific methods Page 9 of 61 to prevent injuries and violence that have been used to prevent disease: carefully describing the problem through surveillance, studying factors that increase or decrease risk for violence or injury, designing and evaluating prevention strategies that address these risk and protective factors, and taking steps to ensure that proven strategies are implemented in communities nationwide. For 30 years, CDC's NCIPC has studied injuries and violence and investigated the best ways to prevent them. We translate science into real-world solutions to prevent violence and injuries before they happen. Research is fundamental to our success in violence prevention, because good research is essential in making sound, smart investments in prevention action. Research provides the knowledge that we need to understand what is possible, what is not, and the best way to progress in our prevention efforts. The CDC has developed a suite of technical packages to help states and communities leverage the best available evidence to prevent multiple forms of violence (see: https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/communicationresources/pub/technical- packages.html). CDC has also developed a prevention resource to prevent adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) that draws upon these technical packages (see: https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/preventingACES.pdf). Strong, innovative, and relevant research is fueled by a diverse field of qualified researchers. NCIPC values supporting new investigators to build capacity to grow the field of violence prevention and become experienced independent investigators. New investigator awards support career trajectories to prepare new investigators to conduct independent research later as a principal investigator of research grants (R01) and cooperative agreements (U01). The intent of Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) RFA-CE-23-003 is to contribute to the development of new researchers in the field of violence prevention. By providing resources to new investigators, they can develop and conduct research that addresses NCIPC's interpersonal violence prevention research priorities and acquire new skills. The NCIPC Research Priorities serve as a foundation for NCIPC's research funding and briefly describe key gaps in the field of violence prevention that need to be addressed to inform prevention activities (https://www.cdc.gov/injury/researchpriorities/index.html). This NOFO is specifically focused on addressing the interpersonal forms of violence impacting children or youth from birth through age 17 (i.e., child abuse and neglect, youth violence, teen dating violence, and sexual violence). Applicants may propose research that focuses on a subset of ages between 0 and 17. Applicants may also include participants outside this age range, but the application should describe how the research question and results are relevant to those ages 0-17. Applicants must propose violence prevention research that focuses on at least one of the interpersonal violence prevention research gaps in the NCIPC Research Priorities and examines one or more forms of violence impacting children and youth. Exposure to violence or other adverse childhood experiences can negatively affect health and development across the lifespan. Multiple forms of violence affect children and youth, including child abuse and neglect, youth violence, teen dating violence, and sexual violence. These forms of violence often share risk and protective factors. Despite these linkages, research is often Page 10 of 61 focused on a specific form of violence in ways that limit our understanding of whether prevention strategies have cross-cutting impacts. CDC's Division of Violence Prevention's Strategic Vision includes \"addressing factors that cut across multiple forms of violence\" as a guiding principle (see https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/publichealthissue/strategicvision.html). Applicants are encouraged to address multiple forms of violence impacting children or youth when possible. Importantly, the majority of children and youth aged 0-17 who were victims of homicide in 2020 died from firearm-related injuries. Thus, applicants are encouraged to examine firearm-related behavior, crime, injuries, and deaths among children and youth or include firearm-related behavior, crime, injuries, and deaths among children and youth as outcomes. Using the public health approach, NCIPC is committed to supporting research to reduce the burden of violence and inequities across groups. The social and structural conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age can be shaped by the distribution of resources, which is influenced in part by policy. These social determinants of health (e.g., concentrated poverty, structural racism, high rates of unemployment and community violence, limited access to high- quality education and /or affordable, high-quality child care) contribute to health inequities, including the differences in health status seen across population groups. Research related to addressing the social or structural conditions that contribute to violence and health inequities across population groups is also encouraged. Purpose The purpose of this NCIPC Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to provide support for an intensive, supervised (mentored) career development experience in violence prevention research leading to research independence. NCIPC supports K01 grants to help ensure the availability of an adequate number and trained scientists to address critical public health research questions to prevent violence and injury. Applicants must propose a research project that addresses at least one of the research priorities in the interpersonal violence prevention section of the NCIPC Research Priorities (https://www.cdc.gov/injury/researchpriorities/index.html) as they relate to violence impacting children or youth (from birth through age 17). These research priorities include: Cross-cutting violence prevention Adverse Childhood Experiences Child abuse and neglect Youth violence Intimate partner violence (teen dating violence) Sexual violence Applicants are encouraged to address the following: Multiple forms of violence impacting children or youth Firearm-related behavior, crime, injuries and deaths among children and youth The social or structural conditions that contribute to violence and health inequities across population groups Page 11 of 61 Applications proposing to address research focused on addressing the social and structural conditions that contribute to violence and health inequities, including the differences in health status, as evidenced by the Research Strategy section of the application's research plan, may be considered during the second level of review to broaden distribution of awards. Applications proposing to address research focused on firearm-related behavior, crime, injuries and deaths among children and youth, as evidenced by the Research Strategy section of the application's research plan, may also be considered during the second level of review to broaden distribution of awards. (see Section V. Application Review Information 4. Review and Selection Process ). Applicants should explicitly state the research priorities their appliaction intends to address. Minority Serving Institutions: This NOFO seeks diversity among applicant institutions, research investigators, and partnering organizations to ensure researcher experience and research outcomes are applicable and beneficial to all segments of our population and social ecology. Applicants from or collaborating with Minority Serving Educational Institutions (MSIs), as evidenced by MSI inclusion in the SF-424 Senior/Key Personnel form, are highly encouraged. For the purpose of this NOFO, MSIs include Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions, as defined by the U.S. Department of Education . Meritorious applications from eligible MSIs or eligible institutions collaborating with MSIs, as evidenced by MSI inclusion in the SF-424 Senior/Key Personnel form, may be considered during the second level of review to broaden distribution of awards (see Section V. Application Review Information 4. Review and Selection Process ). References 1. CDC NCIPC Research Priorities https://www.cdc.gov/injury/researchpriorities/index.html 2.

CDC ACEs Prevention Resource: https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/acestudy/index.html Healthy People 2030 and other National Strategic Priorities The National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at CDC within HHS is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of \"Healthy People 2030\" as described in: http://www.healthypeople.gov/. This research addresses multiple violence- related objectives across the Healthy People 2030 Violence Prevention topic area. The proposed research on violence prevention will ultimately add to the existing evidence base on effective strategies for the prevention of multiple forms of violence. Public Health Impact Expanding the pool of public health researchers in the field of violence prevention will increase opportunities for developing innovative and impactful solutions for violence prevention. New investigators will contribute to our knowledge about the best ways to prevent and address violence impacting children or youth from birth through age 17 (e.g., child abuse and neglect, youth violence, teen dating violence, or sexual violence). Relevant Work For 30 years, NCIPC has been the nation's leading public health authority on violence and injury prevention. NCIPC's approach involves three elements: a focus on prevention, a science-driven approach to identify risk and patterns that influence risk and protective factors, and multidisciplinary collaboration to address the problem and keep people safe, healthy, and productive. NCIPC's Division of Violence Prevention has developed and published technical packages to help states and communities take advantage of the best available evidence to prevent violence (https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pub/technical-packages.html). The strategies and approaches in the technical package represent different levels of the social ecology with efforts intended to impact individual behaviors as well as the relationship, family, school, community, and societal factors that influence risk and protective factors for violence. CDC has also released an ACEs prevention resource that highlights six ACEs prevention strategies drawn from CDC technical packages (https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/preventingACES.pdf). NCIPC's research priorities (https://www.cdc.gov/injury/researchpriorities/index.html) and the Division of Violence Prevention's Strategic Vision (https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/publichealthissue/strategicvision.html) support the need for prevention strategies that address multiple forms of violence. A key goal of CDC's research is to enhance the effects of violence prevention activities by focusing on the interconnections across the different forms of violence. Cross-cutting violence prevention activities can use resources more effectively and help achieve health equity by focusing on the underlying conditions that contribute to increased risk. Examples of previously-funded research and descriptions of violence prevention initiatives are available on NCIPC's website: https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/publichealthissue/fundedprograms/research- awards.html 2. Approach Objectives/Outcomes Page 13 of 61 NCIPC's overall goal is to increase the number and diversity of experienced violence prevention research professionals available to conduct independent violence prevention research. The purpose of this research grant program is to support the development of new researchers who have not yet served as a contact PD/PI on a specified major CDC or NIH research award and address NCIPC's violence prevention research priorities for interpersonal violence impacting children or youth from birth through age 17. These research priorities include cross-cutting violence prevention; adverse childhood experiences; child abuse and neglect; youth violence; intimate partner violence (teen dating violence); and sexual violence.

Research Strategy Requirements Under NOFO RFA-CE-23-003 NCIPC intends to support meritorious research projects that address at least one of the research priorities in the interpersonal violence prevention section of the NCIPC Research Priorities (https://www.cdc.gov/injury/researchpriorities/index.html) as they relate to violence impacting children or youth (from birth through age 17). These research priorities include cross-cutting violence prevention; adverse childhood experiences; child abuse and neglect; youth violence; intimate partner violence (teen dating violence); and sexual violence. The application must clearly state the NCIPC interpersonal violence research priority or priorities to be addressed by the proposed research in the Specific Aims section of the application. Applications that do not clearly propose to address, in the Specific Aims section of the application, at least one interpersonal violence prevention research priority impacting children or youth (from birth through age 17) and related to cross- cutting violence prevention, adverse childhood experiences, child abuse and neglect, youth violence, intimate partner violence (teen dating violence), and/or sexual violence will be considered nonresponsive and will not be forwarded for peer review. The application should clearly describe the proposed research approach including 1) the data source(s) and data access plans, 2) the planned analyses and how the analytic approach is well suited to the data source, 3) the research scope, and 4) the proposed study design. If the proposed research is related to a larger study, clearly describe the relationship between the two efforts. If Page 16 of 61 the proposed research is a feasibility study, clearly describe the justification for the proposed research and clearly describe how the proposed research will contribute to the overall goals of the larger study. Analytic plans should anticipate and evaluate the effects of threats to the internal and external validity of the specified research design. Rigorous research designs using quantitative or mixed methods that are appropriate to address the research questions are preferred. Applicants must propose studies that can feasibly be completed within the requested budget and project period. Proposed research projects could include an expansion of a current investigation in which the researcher is involved or analyses of secondary data. Research plans must describe the research question(s) of interest and the proposed hypothesis for the study, the proposed aims and objectives, and research study design to test the hypothesis, as well as the expected outcomes to be evaluated. The use of any secondary data, proposed analytic strategy, and the estimated sample size and power for analysis for outcomes of interest must be clearly specified. The budget, budget justification, and PHS 308 Career Development Award sections of the application must clearly describe the contact PD/PI's commitment to dedicating at least 7.3 person-months per year (60% effort) to the proposed research and career development and training activities for the entirety of the project period. The proposed activities should demonstrate a coordinated approach to prepare for conducting future independent research in the field of violence prevention. Applications that do not demonstrate contact PD/PI commitment to a minimum of 60% of full-time professional effort to their research project and career development throughout the entirety of the project period, as evidenced by the application's SF-424 Research and Related Budget effort of at least 7.3 person-months/year for the contact PD/PI, will be considered nonresponsive and will not be forwarded for peer review. Applications must be responsive to NOFO RFA-CE-23-003 Section III. Eligibility Information 5. Responsiveness of this NOFO. It is the applicant's responsibility to ensure that the submitted research proposal meets all responsiveness criteria listed in Section III. Eligibility Information 5. Responsiveness . Objectives/Outcomes Describe the expected objectives/outcomes to be achieved by the end of the period of performance, so that applicants clearly understand the outcomes expected if awarded funding. Objectives/outcomes are the intended results that are expected as a consequence of the program and its strategies. Period of Performance outcomes must be related to addressing the public health problem (or gap) articulated in the purpose and problem statement. In general, Period of Performance outcomes typically focus on intermediate and long term outcomes and align directly to the stated objectives. All outcomes should indicate the direction of desired change (i.e. increase, decrease, maintain). Applications must address at least one of the following interpersonal violence prevention research priorities described in the NCIPC Research Priorities (https://www.cdc.gov/injury/researchpriorities/index.html ) as they relate to violence impacting Page 17 of 61 children or youth (from birth through age 17). These research priorities include those in the following sections: Cross-cutting violence prevention Adverse Childhood Experiences Child abuse and neglect Youth violence Intimate partner violence (teen dating violence) Sexual violence Multiple forms of violence affect children and youth, including child abuse and neglect, youth violence, teen dating violence, and sexual violence. These forms of violence often share risk and protective factors. Despite these linkages, research is often focused on a specific form of violence in ways that limit our understanding of whether prevention strategies have cross-cutting impacts. Applicants are encouraged to address multiple forms of violence impacting children or youth when possible. Importantly, the majority of children and youth aged 0-17 who were victims of homicide in 2020 died from firearm-related injuries. Thus, applicants are encouraged to examine firearm-related behavior, crime, injuries, and deaths among children and youth or include firearm-related behavior, crime, injuries, and deaths among children and youth as outcomes. Research related to addressing the social or structural conditions that are empirically or theoretically associated with child abuse and neglect or other forms of violence affecting children and youth and that contribute to health inequities across population groups is also encouraged. Applicants are encouraged to address the following: Multiple forms of violence impacting children or youth Firearm-related behavior, crime, injuries and deaths among children and youth The social or structural conditions that contribute to violence and health inequities across population groups Research Outcomes Applications must provide, in the Research Strategy (Significance), a description of the research intent and the expected research outcomes. Applications must assess violence outcomes (e.g., victimization or perpetration) or key risk or protective factors for one or more forms of violence impacting children or youth (i.e., child abuse and neglect, youth violence, teen dating violence, and sexual violence) in these research priority areas: cross-cutting violence prevention; adverse childhood experiences; child abuse and neglect; youth violence; intimate partner violence (teen dating violence); and sexual violence. Applications that do not propose to assess violence outcomes (e.g., victimization or perpetration) or key risk or protective factors for one or more of the forms of violence impacting children or youth from birth through age 17 in the specified research areas will be considered nonresponsive and will not be forwarded for peer review. Data collection, acquisition, and analysis Page 18 of 61 Applicants must identify and describe appropriate data sources and provide evidence of their ability to acquire and/or collect data of sufficient quantity and quality to conduct the proposed research within the two-year project period. Applications should clearly describe and justify the proposed sampling methods, sample size, power estimates, and data collection methods for the primary outcome(s) and other proposed secondary measures and subgroup analyses. The timeline for data acquisition (requests for extant data and or primary data collection) must be specified. Numerous data sources can be used for the outcome data, including emergency department data, law enforcement data, self-report data, and other sources of data. In addition, administrative data from relevant agencies and survey data collected prior to or in the context of the evaluation are potential sources. Appropriate data sources will vary by the proposed research approach and outcome measures. The outcome(s) should be measured at the level consistent with the research focus (e.g., federal, state, local, or organizational), the population of interest and the data sources available or collected for the purposes of this project (e.g., administrative, survey, surveillance, hospital or emergency departments, detention facilities, etc.). Research Products The impact of a research investment can be measured by the research products. Examples include publications, reports, conference proceedings, databases, tools, methods, guidelines, recommendations, training and education materials, and investigator career development. The research products represent the impact of the research on goals envisioned for the project. The products can include identification of risk and protective factors or evidence for a new prevention strategy. Applications are encouraged to develop a translation plan for the development and dissemination of research products developed as a result of funding under this NOFO. Protection of Human Subjects and Personally Identifiable Information The Research Strategy section of the application is expected to clearly describe the type, source, access to, and protections of the data and human subjects participating in the study. Access to non-publicly available, previously collected data must be clearly described in the Research Strategy and documented with a signed Data Sharing Agreement or Letter of Support. Access to publicly available, previously collected data must be clearly described in the Research Strategy. Protection of previously collected data includes, but is not limited to, protection of personally identifiable information from loss and/or misuse. The application is expected to identify each performance site that will be conducting human subjects research and include the FWA number for the applicant institution and each performance site. Research conducted with more than one institution will be expected to use a single Institutional Review Board (sIRB) to conduct the ethical review required by HHS regulations. See Section IV. Application and Submission Information, 10 Funding Restrictions, Human Subjects for details. Target Population The population of interest is children or youth from birth through age 17. Applicants are encouraged to focus on children or youth who are experiencing higher risk for violence, including but not limited to historically underserved racial/ethnic minorities, people with Page 19 of 61 disabilities, tribal populations, and sexual and gender minorities, and the underlying social and structural conditions that are contributing to this higher risk. Collaboration/Partnerships It is required that, for all applications, the majority (60% or greater) of the proposed research work plan, as evidenced by the application's SF-424 Research and Related Budget, will be directly carried out by the applicant organization throughout the entirety of the project period. The applicant organization cannot serve as a \"pass through\" to fund another entity to conduct the majority of the research. It is required that, for all applications, the contact PD/PI commit a minimum of 60% of full-time professional effort (i.e., a minimum of 7.3 person-months/year) to their research project and career development throughout the entirety of the project period. Contact PD/PIs may engage in other duties as part of the remaining 40% of their full-time professional effort not covered by this award, as long as such duties do not interfere with or detract from the proposed research and career development program. Applications that do not demonstrate contact PD/PI commitment to a minimum of 60% of full-time professional effort to their research project and career development throughout the entirety of the project period, as evidenced by the application's SF-424 Research and Related Budget effort of at least 7.3 person-months/year for the contact PD/PI, will be considered nonresponsive and will not be forwarded for peer review. Partnerships with state and local Departments of Public Health, health systems, hospitals, law enforcement, municipalities or any other entities are encouraged to support the conduct of the proposed research. Partnerships with entities that hold the existing data or data sources necessary to answer any proposed questions of interest should be demonstrated by letters of agreement or memorandums of understanding. The role of the partners, and their level of involvement and commitment to provide the data, support, etc., required for the study should be clearly specified. The letters documenting any partnerships required for the conduct of the study should be included in the Letters of Support section of the grant application. Applications will be evaluated during peer review on the extent to which Letters of Support, Memoranda of Understanding, and Data Sharing Agreements, as applicable to the application's reseach plan, demonstrate the necessary collaborations and commitment from research partners. Therefore, it is incumbent on the applicant to clearly describe each contribution of each partnership to the proposed research in the Research Strategy and document the intent and capabilities of each partnership with a signed Data Sharing Agreement, Letter of Support, or Memorandum of Understanding. Minority Serving Institutions: This NOFO seeks diversity among applicant institutions, research investigators, and partnering organizations to ensure researcher experience and research outcomes are applicable and beneficial to all segments of our population and social ecology.

Page 26 of 61 PLEASE NOTE: Effective April 4, 2022, applicants must have a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) at the time of application submission. The UEI replaced the Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and is generated as part of SAM.gov registration. Current SAM.gov registrants have already been assigned their UEI and can view it in SAM.gov and Grants.gov. Additional information is available on the GSA website , SAM.gov , and Grants.gov-Finding the UEI. (Foreign entities only): Special Instructions for acquiring a Commercial and Governmental Entity (NCAGE) Code: NCAGE Tool / Products / NCS Help Center (nato.int) . System for Award Management (SAM) - must maintain current registration in SAM (the replacement system for the Central Contractor Registration) to be renewed annually, SAM.gov . Grants.gov eRA Commons All applicant organizations must register with Grants.gov. Please visit www.Grants.gov at least 30 days prior to submitting your application to familiarize yourself with the registration and submission processes. The one-time registration process will take three to five days to complete. However, it is best to start the registration process at least two weeks prior to application submission. All Senior/Key Personnel (including Program Directors/Principal Investigators (PD/PIs) must also work with their institutional officials to register with the eRA Commons or ensure their existing Principal Investigator (PD/PI) eRA Commons account is affiliated with the eRA commons account of the applicant organization. All registrations must be successfully completed and active before the application due date. Applicant organizations are strongly encouraged to start the eRA Commons registration process at least four (4) weeks prior to the application due date. ASSIST requires that applicant users have an active eRA Commons account in order to prepare an application. It also requires that the applicant organization's Signing Official have an active eRA Commons Signing Official account in order to initiate the submission process. During the submission process, ASSIST will prompt the Signing Official to enter their Grants.gov Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR) credentials in order to complete the submission, therefore the applicant organization must ensure that their Grants.gov AOR credentials are active. 7. Universal Identifier Requirements and System for Award Management (SAM) All applicant organizations must obtain a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) number as the Universal Identifier when applying for Federal grants or cooperative agreements. The UEI number is a twelve-digit number assigned by SAM.gov. An AOR should be consulted to determine the appropriate number. If the organization does not have a UEI number, an AOR should register through SAM.gov. Note this is an organizational number. Individual Program Directors/Principal Investigators do not need to register for a UEI number. Additionally, organizations must maintain the registration with current information at all times during which it has an application under consideration for funding by CDC and, if an award is Page 27 of 61 made, until a final financial report is submitted or the final payment is received, whichever is later. SAM.gov is the primary registrant database for the Federal government and is the repository into which an entity must provide information required for the conduct of business as a recipient. Additional information about registration procedures may be found at SAM.gov and the SAM.gov Knowledge Base . If an award is granted, the recipient organization must notify potential sub-recipients that no organization may receive a subaward under the grant unless the organization has provided its UEI number to the recipient organization. 8. Eligible Individuals (Project Director/Principal Investigator) in Organizations/Institutions Any individual(s) with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the Project Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) is invited to work with his/her organization to develop an application for support. Individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as individuals with disabilities are always encouraged to apply for HHS/CDC support. 9. Cost Sharing This NOFO does not require cost sharing as defined in the HHS Grants Policy Statement (http://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/grants/grants/policies-regulations/hhsgps107.pdf ). 10. Number of Applications As defined in the HHS Grants Policy Statement, (https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/grants/grants/policies-regulations/hhsgps107.pdf ), applications received in response to the same Notice of Funding Opportunity generally are scored individually and then ranked with other applications under peer review in their order of relative programmatic, technical, or scientific merit. HHS/CDC will not accept any application in response to this NOFO that is essentially the same as one currently pending initial peer review unless the applicant withdraws the pending application. Eligible applicant organizations may submit more than one application, provided that each application is scientifically distinct. However, applicant institutions can submit only one grant application with the same contact PD/PI in response to this NOFO. Additionally, applicant institutions can submit only one grant application with the same Mentor in response to this NOFO. Only one application per contact PD/PI will be reviewed or funded under this announcement; only one application per Mentor will be reviewed or funded under this announcement. If two or more applications from the same contact PD/PI are received, the only application that will be submitted for review will be the last application received based on the document's time and date stamp in Grants.gov (http://www.grants.gov). If two or more applications identifying the same Mentor are received, the only application that will be submitted for review will be the last application received based on the document's time and date stamp in Grants.gov (http://www.grants.gov). The contact PD/PI and primary Mentor may be employed by the applicant institution or be employed at different institutions. Page 28 of 61 Applicant institutions submitting applications with essentially the same proposed research to two or more CDC NOFOs will not be funded under more than one NOFO. Contact PD/PIs submitting applications to this NOFO and any other CDC NOFO will not be funded under more than one NOFO. Section IV. Application and Submission Information 1.

Submission Dates & Times Part I. Overview Information contains information about Key Dates. Applicants are strongly encouraged to allocate additional time and submit in advance of the deadline to ensure they have time to make any corrections that might be necessary for successful submission. This includes the time necessary to complete the application resubmission process that may be necessary, if errors are identified during validation by Grants.gov and the NIH eRA systems. The application package is not complete until it has passed the Grants.gov and NIH eRA Commons submission and validation processes. Applicants will use a platform or system to submit applications. ASSIST is a commonly used platform because it provides a validation of all requirements prior to submission. If ASSIST detects errors, then the applicant must correct errors before their application can be submitted. Applicants should view their applications in ASSIST after submission to ensure accurate and successful submission through Grants.gov. If the submission is not successful and post-submission errors are found, then those errors must be corrected and the application must be resubmitted in ASSIST. Applicants are able to access, view, and track the status of their applications in the eRA Commons. Information on the submission process is provided in the SF-424 (R&R) Application Guidance and ASSIST User Guide at https://era.nih.gov/files/ASSIST_user_guide.pdf . Note : HHS/CDC grant submission procedures do not provide a grace period beyond the grant application due date time to correct any error or warning notices of noncompliance with application instructions that are identified by Grants.gov or eRA systems (i.e., error correction window). Page 33 of 61 Applicants who encounter problems when submitting their applications must attempt to resolve them by contacting the NIH eRA Service desk at: Toll-free: 1-866-504-9552; Phone: 301-402-7469 http://grants.nih.gov/support/index.html Hours: Mon-Fri, 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern Time (closed on Federal holidays) Problems with Grants.gov can be resolved by contacting the Grants.gov Contact Center at: Toll-free: 1-800-518-4726 https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/support.html support@grants.gov Hours: 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; closed on Federal holidays It is important that applicants complete the application submission process well in advance of the due date time. After submission of your application package, applicants will receive a \"submission receipt\" email generated by Grants.gov. Grants.gov will then generate a second e-mail message to applicants which will either validate or reject their submitted application package. A third and final e-mail message is generated once the applicant's application package has passed validation and the grantor agency has confirmed receipt of the application. Unsuccessful Submissions : If an application submission was unsuccessful, the applicant must: 1. Track submission and verify the submission status (tracking should be done initially regardless of rejection or success). a. If the status states \"rejected,\" be sure to save time stamped, documented rejection notices, and do #2a or #2b 2. Check emails from both Grants.gov and NIH eRA Commons for rejection notices. a. If the deadline has passed, he/she should email the Grants Management contact listed in the Agency Contacts section of this announcement explaining why the submission failed. b. If there is time before the deadline, correct the problem(s) and resubmit as soon as possible. Due Date for Applications 01/04/2023 01/04/2023 Electronically submitted applications must be submitted no later than 11:59 p.m., ET, on the listed application due date. 10. Funding Restrictions Expanded Authority: Page 34 of 61 For more information on expanded authority and pre-award costs, go to https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/grants/grants/policies-regulations/hhsgps107.pdf and speak to your GMS. All HHS/CDC awards are subject to the federal regulations, in 45 CFR Part 75, terms and conditions, and other requirements described in the HHS Grants Policy Statement. Pre-award costs may be allowable as an expanded authority, but only if authorized by CDC. Public Health Data: CDC requires that mechanisms for, and cost of, public health data sharing be included in grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts. The cost of sharing or archiving public health data may also be included as part of the total budget requested for first-time or continuation awards. Data Management Plan: Fulfilling the data-sharing requirement must be documented in a Data Management Plan (DMP) that is developed during the project planning phase prior to the initiation of generating or collecting public health data and must be included in the Resource Sharing Plan(s) section of the PHS398 Research Plan Component of the application. Applicants who contend that the public health data they collect or create are not appropriate for release must justify that contention in the DMP submitted with their application for CDC funds (for example, privacy and confidentiality considerations, embargo issues). Recipients who fail to release public health data in a timely fashion will be subject to procedures normally used to address lack of compliance (for example, reduction in funding, restriction of funds, or award termination) consistent with 45 CFR 74.62 or other authorities as appropriate. For further information, please see: https://www.cdc.gov/grants/additional-requirements/ar- 25.html Human Subjects: Funds relating to the conduct of research involving human subjects will be restricted until the appropriate assurances and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals are in place. Copies of all current local IRB approval letters and local IRB approved protocols (and CDC IRB approval letters, if applicable) will be required to lift restrictions. If the proposed research project involves more than one institution and will be conducted in the United States, awardees are expected to use a single Institutional Review Board (sIRB) to conduct the ethical review required by HHS regulations for the Protections of Human Subjects Research, and include a single IRB plan in the application, unless review by a sIRB would be prohibited by a federal, tribal, or state law, regulation, or policy or a compelling justification based on ethical or human subjects protection issues or other well-justified reasons is provided. Exceptions will be reviewed and approved by CDC in accordance with Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Regulations ( 45 CFR Part 46), or a restriction may be placed on the award. For more information, please contact the scientific/research contact included on this NOFO. Note: The sIRB requirement applies to participating sites in the United States. Foreign sites participating in CDC-funded, cooperative research studies are not expected to follow the requirement for sIRB. Page 35 of 61 Protection of Human Subjects and Personally Identifiable Information: The Research Strategy section of the application is expected to clearly describe the type, source, access to, and protections of the data and human subjects participating in the study. Access to non-publicly available, previously collected data must be clearly described in the Research Strategy and documented with a signed Data Sharing Agreement or Letter of Support. Access to publicly available, previously collected data must be clearly described in the Research Strategy. Protection of previously collected data includes, but is not limited to, protection of personal identifiable information from loss and/or misuse. The application is expected to identify each performance site that will be conducting human subjects research and include the FWA number for the applicant institution and each performance site. Research conducted with more than one institution will be expected to use a single Institutional Review Board (sIRB) to conduct the ethical review required by HHS regulations. Data Management Plan : Applicants should develop and include, as part of the application's Resource Sharing Plan section of the PHS 398 Research Plan Component, a data management plan that meets the requirements of AR-25 using their own template. Applicants funded under this NOFO will be required to use NCIPC's Data Management Plan Template, OMB NO: 0920- 1301 (Exp. Date: 06/30/2023) to make revisions to the DMP as required during the award's project period. 11. Other Submission Requirements and Information Risk Assessment Questionnaire Requirement CDC is required to conduct pre-award risk assessments to determine the risk an applicant poses to meeting federal programmatic and administrative requirements by taking into account issues such as financial instability, insufficient management systems, non-compliance with award conditions, the charging of unallowable costs, and inexperience. The risk assessment will include an evaluation of the applicant's CDC Risk Questionnaire, located at https://www.cdc.gov/grants/documents/PPMR-G-CDC-Risk-Questionnaire.pdf , as well as a review of the applicant's history in all available systems; including OMB-designated repositories of government-wide eligibility and financial integrity systems (see 45 CFR 75.205(a)), and other sources of historical information. These systems include, but are not limited to: FAPIIS (https://www.fapiis.gov/), including past performance on federal contracts as per Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of 2009; Do Not Pay list; and System for Award Management (SAM) exclusions. CDC requires all applicants to complete the Risk Questionnaire, OMB Control Number 0920- 1132 annually. This questionnaire, which is located at https://www.cdc.gov/grants/documents/PPMR-G-CDC-Risk-Questionnaire.pdf , along with supporting documentation must be submitted with your application by the closing date of the Notice of Funding Opportunity Announcement. If your organization has completed CDC's Risk Questionnaire within the past 12 months of the closing date of this NOFO, then you must submit a copy of that questionnaire, or submit a letter signed by the authorized organization representative to include the original submission date, organization's EIN and UEI. When uploading supporting documentation for the Risk Questionnaire into this application package, clearly label the documents for easy identification of the type of documentation. For Page 36 of 61 example, a copy of Procurement policy submitted in response to the questionnaire may be labeled using the following format: Risk Questionnaire Supporting Documents _ Procurement Policy. Duplication of Efforts Applicants are responsible for reporting if this application will result in programmatic, budgetary, or commitment overlap with another application or award (i.e., grant, cooperative agreement, or contract) submitted to another funding source in the same fiscal year. Programmatic overlap occurs when (1) substantially the same project is proposed in more than one application or is submitted to two or more funding sources for review and funding consideration or (2) a specific objective and the project design for accomplishing the objective are the same or closely related in two or more applications or awards, regardless of the funding source. Budgetary overlap occurs when duplicate or equivalent budgetary items (e.g., equipment, salaries) are requested in an application but already are provided by another source. Commitment overlap occurs when an individual's time commitment exceeds 100 percent, whether or not salary support is requested in the application. Overlap, whether programmatic, budgetary, or commitment of an individual's effort greater than 100 percent, is not permitted. Any overlap will be resolved by the CDC with the applicant and the PD/PI prior to award. Report Submission: The applicant must upload the report under \"Other Attachment Forms.\" The document should be labeled: \"Report on Programmatic, Budgetary, and Commitment Overlap.\" The budget included with the application must take into account the following funding restrictions associated with this NOFO: Grant funds will not be made available to support the provision of direct care. Grant funds will not be made available for mentor or research assistance support. Eligible applicants may enter into contracts, including consortia agreements, as necessary to meet the requirements of this program and strengthen the overall application. Allowable costs include partial salary and tuition support for the applicant contact PD/PI; direct research project expenses such as trainee stipends, interviewer costs, data processing, participant incentives, statistical consultation services, and supplies. Travel to one scientific meeting, if adequately justified, is allowable. Funds for tuition support are limited to no more than 20% of the overall award and their use must be generally related to the content and methods of the proposed research. Applicants should include travel costs for one, two-day trip to CDC in Atlanta to present research findings during the last year of the award. Indirect costs for this trainee-related grant are limited to eight (8) percent of the Modified Total Direct Cost. If requesting indirect costs in the budget based on a federally negotiated rate, a copy of the indirect cost rate agreement is required. Include a copy of the current negotiated federal indirect cost rate agreement or cost allocation plan approval letter. Application Submission Page 37 of 61 Applications must be submitted electronically following the instructions described in the SF 424 (R&R) Application Guide. PAPER APPLICATIONS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. Applicants must complete all required registrations before the application due date. Section III.6 \"Required Registrations\" contains information about registration.

Additional Review Considerations As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact/priority score. Applications from Foreign Organizations N/A Resource Sharing Plan(s) HHS/CDC policy requires that recipients of grant awards make research resources and data readily available for research purposes to qualified individuals within the scientific community after publication. Please see: https://www.cdc.gov/grants/additional-requirements/ar-25.html New additional requirement : CDC requires recipients for projects and programs that involve data collection or generation of data with federal funds to develop and submit a Data Management Plan (DMP) for each collection of public health data. Investigators responding to this Notice of Funding Opportunity should include a detailed DMP in the Resource Sharing Plan(s) section of the PHS 398 Research Plan Component of the application. The AR-25 outlines the components of a DMP and provides additional information for investigators regarding the requirements for data accessibility, storage, and preservation. The DMP should be developed during the project planning phase prior to the initiation of collecting or generating public health data and will be submitted with the application. The submitted DMP will be evaluated for completeness and quality at the time of submission. The DMP should include, at a minimum, a description of the following: A description of the data to be collected or generated in the proposed project; Standards to be used for the collected or generated data; Mechanisms for, or limitations to, providing access to and sharing of the data (include a description of provisions for the protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, or other rights - this section should address access to identifiable and de-identified data); Statement of the use of data standards that ensure all released data have appropriate documentation that describes the method of collection, what the data represent, and potential limitations for use; and Page 44 of 61 Plans for archiving and long-term preservation of the data, or explaining why long-term preservation and access are not justified (this section should address archiving and preservation of identifiable and de-identified data). Applications submitted without the required DMP may be deemed ineligible for award unless submission of DMP is deferred to a later period depending on the type of award, in which case, funding restrictions may be imposed pending submission and evaluation. CDC OMB approved templates may be used (e.g. NCCDPHP template https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/pdf/nofo/DMP-Template-508.docx Other examples of DMPs may be found here USGS, http://www.usgs.gov//products/data-and- tools/data-management/data-management-plans Budget and Period of Support Reviewers will consider whether the budget and the requested period of support are fully justified and reasonable in relation to the proposed research. The applicant can obtain guidance for completing a detailed justified budget on the CDC website, at the following Internet address: http://www.cdc.gov/grants/interestedinapplying/application-resources.html The budget can include both direct costs and indirect costs as allowed. Indirect costs could include the cost of collecting, managing, sharing and preserving data. Indirect costs on grants awarded to foreign organizations and foreign public entities and performed fully outside of the territorial limits of the U.S. may be paid to support the costs of compliance with federal requirements at a fixed rate of eight percent of modified total direct costs exclusive of tuition and related fees, direct expenditures for equipment, and subawards in excess of $25,000. Negotiated indirect costs may be paid to the American University, Beirut, and the World Health Organization. Indirect costs on training grants are limited to a fixed rate of eight percent of MTDC exclusive of tuition and related fees, direct expenditures for equipment, and sub-awards in excess of $25,000. If requesting indirect costs in the budget based on a federally negotiated rate, a copy of the indirect cost rate agreement is required. Include a copy of the current negotiated federal indirect cost rate agreement or cost allocation plan approval letter. 4. Review and Selection Process Applications will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by an appropriate peer review group, in accordance with CDC peer review policy and procedures, using the stated review criteria. As part of the scientific peer review, all applications: Will receive a written critique. Page 45 of 61 Applications will be assigned to the appropriate HHS/CDC Center, Institute, or Office. Applications will compete for available funds with all other recommended applications submitted in response to this NOFO. Following initial peer review, recommended applications will receive a second level of review. The following will be considered in making funding recommendations: Scientific and technical merit of the proposed project as determined by scientific peer review. Availability of funds. Relevance of the proposed project to program priorities. Applications that meet scientific and technical merit as determined by scientific peer review may also undergo consideration at the second level of review for: Relevance to NCIPC Research Priorities (https://www.cdc.gov/injury/researchpriorities/index.html). The significance of the proposed activities in relation to the priorities and objectives stated in Section I. Funding Opportunity Description 1. Background and Purpose Healthy People 2030 and other National Strategic Priorities, as evidenced by the Research Strategy section of the application's research plan. Consideration for applications proposing research focused on addressing the social and structural conditions that contribute to violence and health inequities, including the differences in health status, as evidenced by the Research Strategy section of the application's research plan, to broaden distribution of awards. Consideration for applications proposing research focused on addressing firearm-related behavior, crime, injuries and deaths among children and youth, as evidenced by the Research Strategy section of the application's research plan, to broaden distribution of awards. Consideration for applicant organizations from or conducting research in collaboration or partnership with Minority Serving Educational Institutions, (MSIs) i.e., Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), or Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions, as defined by the U.S. Department of Education , and as evidenced by MSI inclusion in the SF-424 Senior/Key Personnel form, to broaden distribution of awards. Consideration for applications in which the contact eligible PD/PI is from an under- represented population, as defined in the NIH Diversity Statement and as verified by the applicant institution, to broaden distribution of awards in order to support career development in violence prevention research for PD/PIs from under-represented populations. If the applicant institution wishes to be considered for this secondary review consideration, the applicant institution must submit, after scientific and technical merit peer review has concluded, a Candidate Eligibility Statement to the CDC which attests that the contact eligible PD/PI is from an under-represented population as defined in the NIH Diversity Statement and which is signed by the Authorized Representative named on the SF-424 (R&R) application eSubmission Face Page. The Candidate Eligibility Statement should not be included as part of the application package but instead should be submitted as a stand alone document to the Financial/Grants Management or Scientific Program Official Contact named in this announcement (see Section VII. Agency Page 46 of 61 Contacts ) after scientific and technical merit peer review has concluded. An applicant institution is not required to submit a Candidate Eligibility Statement in order to be considered for funding under this announcement. Review of risk posed by applicants. Prior to making a Federal award, CDC is required by 31 U.S.C. 3321 and 41 U.S.C. 2313 to review information available through any OMB-designated repositories of government-wide eligibility qualification or financial integrity information as appropriate. See also suspension and debarment requirements at 2 CFR parts 180 and 376. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 2313, CDC is required to review the non-public segment of the OMB-designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently the Federal Recipient Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS)) prior to making a Federal award where the Federal share is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, defined in 41 U.S.C. 134, over the period of performance. At a minimum, the information in the system for a prior Federal award recipient must demonstrate a satisfactory record of executing programs or activities under Federal grants, cooperative agreements, or procurement awards; and integrity and business ethics. CDC may make a Federal award to a recipient who does not fully meet these standards if it is determined that the information is not relevant to the current Federal award under consideration or there are specific conditions that can appropriately mitigate the effects of the non-Federal entity's risk in accordance with 45 CFR \u00a775.207. CDC's framework for evaluating the risks posed by an applicant may incorporate results of the evaluation of the applicant's eligibility or the quality of its application. If it is determined that a Federal award will be made, special conditions that correspond to the degree of risk assessed may be applied to the Federal award. The evaluation criteria is described in this Notice of Funding Opportunity. In evaluating risks posed by applicants, CDC will use a risk-based approach and may consider any items such as the following: (1) Financial stability; (2) Quality of management systems and ability to meet the management standards prescribed in this part; (3) History of performance. The applicant's record in managing Federal awards, if it is a prior recipient of Federal awards, including timeliness of compliance with applicable reporting requirements, conformance to the terms and conditions of previous Federal awards, and if applicable, the extent to which any previously awarded amounts will be expended prior to future awards; (4) Reports and findings from audits performed under 45 CFR Part 75, subpart F, or the reports and findings of any other available audits; and (5) The applicant's ability to effectively implement statutory, regulatory, or other requirements imposed on non-Federal entities. CDC must comply with the guidelines on government-wide suspension and debarment in 2 CFR part 180, and require non-Federal entities to comply with these provisions. These provisions restrict Federal awards, subawards and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, Page 47 of 61 suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal programs or activities. 5. Anticipated Announcement and Award Dates After the peer review of the application is completed, the PD/PI will be able to access his or her Summary Statement (written critique) and other pertinent information via the eRA Commons.

Page 52 of 61 Dual Use Research of Concern On September 24, 2014, the US Government Policy for the Institutional Oversight of Life Sciences Dual Use Research of Concern was released. Grantees (foreign and domestic) receiving CDC funding on or after September 24, 2015 are subject to this policy. Research funded by CDC, involving the agents or toxins named in the policy, must be reviewed to determine if it involves one or more of the listed experimental effects and if so, whether it meets the definition of DURC. This review must be completed by an Institutional Review Entity (IRE) identified by the funded institution. Recipients also must establish an Institutional Contact for Dual Use Research (ICDUR). The award recipient must maintain records of institutional DURC reviews and completed risk mitigation plans for the term of the research grant, cooperative agreement or contract plus three years after its completion, but no less than eight years, unless a shorter period is required by law or regulation. If a project is determined to be DURC, a risk/benefit analysis must be completed. CDC will work collaboratively with the award recipient to develop a risk mitigation plan that the CDC must approve. The USG policy can be found at http://www.phe.gov/s3/dualuse . Non-compliance with this Policy may result in suspension, limitation, restriction or termination of USG-funding, or loss of future USG funding opportunities for the non- compliant USG-funded research project and of USG-funds for other life sciences research at the institution, consistent with existing regulations and policies governing USG-funded research, and may subject the institution to other potential penalties under applicable laws and regulations. Data Management Plan(s) CDC requires that all new collections of public health data include a Data Management Plan (DMP). For purposes of this announcement, \"public health data\" means digitally recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as a basis for public health findings, conclusions, and implementation. This new requirement ensures that CDC is in compliance with the following; Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum titled \"Open Data Policy - Managing Information as an Asset\" (OMB M-13-13); Executive Order 13642 titled \"Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information\"; and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) memorandum titled \"Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research\" (OSTP Memo). The AR-25 https://www.cdc.gov/grants/additional-requirements/ar-25.html outlines the components of a DMP and provides additional information for investigators regarding the requirements for data accessibility, storage, and preservation. Certificates of Confidentiality: Institutions and investigators are responsible for determining whether research they conduct is subject to Section 301(d) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act. Section 301(d), as amended by Section 2012 of the 21st Century Cures Act, P.L. 114-255 (42 U.S.C. 241(d)), states that the Secretary shall issue Certificates of Page 53 of 61 Confidentiality (Certificates) to persons engaged in biomedical, behavioral, clinical, or other research activities in which identifiable, sensitive information is collected. In furtherance of this provision, CDC-supported research commenced or ongoing after December 13, 2016 in which identifiable, sensitive information is collected, as defined by Section 301(d), is deemed issued a Certificate and therefore required to protect the privacy of individuals who are subjects of such research. Certificates issued in this manner will not be issued as a separate document, but are issued by application of this term and condition to this award. See Additional Requirement 36 to ensure compliance with this term and condition. The link to the full text is at: https://www.cdc.gov/grants/additional- requirements/ar-36.html . 4. Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions Not Applicable (N/A). 5. Reporting Recipients will be required to complete Research Performance Progress Report (RPPR) in eRA Commons at least annually (see https://grants.nih.gov/grants/rppr/index.htm ; https://grants.nih.gov/grants/forms/report_on_ grant.htm ) and financial statements as required in the HHS Grants Policy Statement. A final progress report, invention statement, equipment inventory list and the expenditure data portion of the Federal Financial Report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the HHS Grants Policy Statement. Although the financial plans of the HHS/CDC CIO(s) provide support for this program, awards pursuant to this funding opportunity depend upon the availability of funds, evidence of satisfactory progress by the recipient (as documented in required reports) and the determination that continued funding is in the best interest of the Federal government. The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Transparency Act), includes a requirement for recipients of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later. Compliance with this law is primarily the responsibility of the Federal agency. However, two elements of the law require information to be collected and reported by recipients: 1) Information on executive compensation when not already reported through the SAM Registration; and 2) Similar information on all sub-awards/ subcontracts/ consortiums over $25,000. It is a requirement for recipients of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later. All recipients of applicable CDC grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) available at www.fsrs.gov on all subawards over $25,000. See the HHS Grants Policy Statement (https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/grants/grants/policies- regulations/hhsgps107.pdf ).
