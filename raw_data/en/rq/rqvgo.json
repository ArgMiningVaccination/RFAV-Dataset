The biotech company claims that it holds the potential for long-term protection, but only when used as a supplement to vaccination. Nutrition Insight speaks with Robert Brummer, one of the researchers behind the study and professor and pro-vice-chancellor of Food & Health at \u00d6rebro University, Sweden. Brummer supports the evidence supporting vitamin D's effects on COVID-19, but affirms that \"No probiotic has been scientifically studied as we did.\" \"Generally, most of the findings reported in literature and the popular press are not based on proper randomized controlled interventions but on epidemiological findings with unknown variance-inducing variables as well as the risk for reverse causation.\" The probiotic strain Limosilactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 was dosed together with 10 g of vitamin D3 for the intervention group, and the control group received a placebo with only vitamin D3 in the same dosage. The experiment was done on 132 healthy individuals who were not yet infected by COVID-19 or received vaccination against it. Throughout the experiment, 95 participants received at least one vaccination dose. The vaccinated participants that consumed Protectis showed \"significantly increased IgA (Immunoglobulin A) antibody levels when 28 days or more had elapsed from vaccination,\" notes the company. Add-on to vaccination The [study's authors argue](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2023.2229938?scroll=top&needAccess=true&role=tab) that even though vaccinations for COVID-19 have been deemed adequate, the virus tends to come back when antibodies are low. \"Considering that mounting evidence suggests that low levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are associated with increased susceptibility to reinfections and breakthrough infections,\" reads the study. The company claims that its probiotics may improve protection from long-term COVID-19 infections against breakthrough infections after vaccination. \"To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effect of probiotic supplementation on different SARS-CoV-2 antibody classes, including virus-neutralizing antibodies in an antibody-na\u00efve cohort,\" says Brummer. A recent study indicated that a probiotic supplement [reduced neutrophilic inflammation](https://www.nutritioninsight.com/news/resbiotic-supplement-linked-to-improved-lung-function-of-asthmatic-patients-in-clinical-trial.html) in the lungs, which is common in many severe lung diseases. Neutrophils make up a large share of white blood cells. In other research, AB-Biotics published a study last year with findings of probiotics offering [\"significant\" positive effects](https://www.nutritioninsight.com/news/probiotics-for-covid-19-ab-biotics-formula-linked-with-positive-outcomes-in-published-study.html) in COVID-19 patients - possibly by influencing the gut-lung axis. Impact on Long Covid Brummer details that whether the probiotics hold the potential to benefit those suffering from long-COVID is still unknown at this stage, as evidence is lacking, and \"sparks two questions.\" \"Firstly, if probiotics are taken at the time of infection, one could argue that less severe infection could be beneficial in preventing Long COVID.\" \"Secondly, we look at the effect of probiotics in the case if you have [already] been diagnosed with Long COVID. In this context, we do not have any scientific evidence for the beneficial effect of probiotics. But as probiotics can affect the brain-gut axis, such an effect can not be excluded but needs thorough research.\" Brummer explains that there are other important considerations regarding this study. \"The upregulation of immunoglobulin is a general feature and not necessarily connected to COVID-19. Therefore it has a wide range of applicability in preventing different viral infections.\" Recently, an Italian study found that [low vitamin D levels](https://www.nutritioninsight.com/news/long-covid-risk-increases-with-low-levels-of-vitamin-d-according-to-study.html) increase the risk of Long COVID. \"Our study shows that COVID-19 patients with low vitamin D levels are more likely to develop Long COVID, but it is not yet known whether vitamin D supplements could improve the symptoms or reduce this risk altogether,\" Andrea Giustina, the study's lead investigator, previously told Nutrition Insight.
