The current discussion is around the alkaline water machines, Kangen to be specific. This device is said to improve your health by \"balancing\" your alkalinity which improves your health. Which I know to be spurious because your stomach gastric acids neutralize what is sent to your stomach. Recently my wife's cousin - who doesn't have much money to begin with, bought a Kangen water machine that I know cost at least $2k. So far (not having the background knowledge in chemistry) I've been unable to convince her of its uselessness as a health product. I need a really convincing scientific argument to convince her of the quackery. Thanks for any assistance.
