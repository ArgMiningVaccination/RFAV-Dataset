BIDMC is part of the newly formed Beth Israel Lahey Health (BILH) - a system of academic medical centers, teaching hospitals, community hospitals, and specialty hospitals that employ more than 4,000 physicians and 35,000 staff members combined. BIDMC is one of BILH's premier institutions with 673 licensed beds and over 1,200 active physicians. BIDMC is also a Level 1 trauma cente r with a full range of medical/surgical, critical care, OB/GYN, and emergency services, and an extensive network of primary care and outpatient specialty care practices. BIDMC prides itself on its ability to combine exceptional and compassionate patient ca re with advanced medical knowledge, research, and technology in ways that allow it to achieve the best outcomes for its patients. In addition to its commitment to clinical excellence, BIDMC is committed to being an active partner and collaborator with the communities it serves. This Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) and the associated Implementation Strategy (IS) were completed in close collaboration with BIDMC's staff, dozens of health and social service partners, and the community at -large. In their entirety, the assessment efforts engaged thousands of community residents, as well as a wide range of other stakeholders, including service providers, community advocates, Commonwealth and local public officials, faith leaders, and representatives from c ommunity -based organizations. The process that was applied to conduct the CHNA and develop the IS exemplifies the spirit of collaboration and community engagement that is such a vital part of BIDMC's mission. This report is an integral part of BIDMC's popu lation health and community engagement efforts. It provides information that is used to make sure that BIDMC's services and programs are appropriately focused, are delivered in ways that are responsive to those in its Community Benefits Service Area (CBSA) , and are conducted to address unmet community needs. This assessment and the associated prioritization and planning processes also allow BIDMC to strengthen its community partnerships. Finally, the CHNA and the IS allow BIDMC to meet its Commonwealth and Federal Community Benefits requirements per the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office (MA AGO) and the Federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as part of the Affordable Care Act. Community Benefits Service Area & Community Benefits Priorities In addition to the Medical Center in the Longwood area of Boston, BIDMC operates licensed multi - specialty outpatient facilities in Chelsea, Lexington, and Chestnut Hill, as well as a cancer center in Needham and a pain center in Brookline. BIDMC also operates a licen sed health center in Bowdoin/Geneva and has strong, long- standing partnerships with an additional four Boston Federally Qualified Health Centers (See Figure Below) within its Community Benefits Service Area (CBSA). The communities in which these facilities operate define BIDMC's CBSA and all of the communities listed above were included in the assessment. In recognition of the considerable health disparities that exist in some communities, BIDMC focuses the bulk of its community benefits resources on improv ing the health status of low income and underserved populations living in the city of Chelsea and the Boston Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 2 F igure 1: BIDMC Community Benefits Service (CBSA) of Allston/Brighton, Bowdoin/Geneva, Chinatown, Fenway/Kenmore, and Roxbury/Mission Hill. While there are certainly segments of the populations in Brookline, Chestnut Hill, Lexington, and Needham that are vulnerable and underserved, the greatest disparities exist in Chelsea and Boston. In order to maximize the impact of its community benefits resources, BIDMC's Community Benefits Committee (CBC) voted to prioritize and focus BIDMC's attention on the more urban, high -need communities in The population segments and community health priorities that have been prioritized by the CHNA, as well as the core elements of BIDMC's community health improvement response are discussed in summary below, and in greater detail in the full CHNA report. Approach and Methods In conducting this assessment and planning process, it would be difficult to overstate BIDMC's commitment to community engagement and a robust, collaborative, transparent, and objective process. Rather than one -single assessment, BIDMC's Community Benefits staff dedicated countless hours of their time and other resources to participate in and gather information from a series of three concurrent and comprehensive assessments that were conducted by organizations or collectives of organizations throughout Boston and Chelsea. BIDMC also integrated the extensive community engagement and strategic planning work that BIDMC is conducting as part of its Massachusetts Determination of Need New Inpatient Building Community -based Health Initiative (CHI). Involvement in these four efforts allowed BIDMC to leverage resources and create a robust and inclusive CHNA and IS process. In October of 2019, BIDMC hired John Snow, Inc. (JSI), a public health consulting firm based in Boston, to integrate the information gathered across these concurrent assessments and augment the information gathered where appropriate. BIDMC worked with JSI to ensure that the final BIDMC CHNA engaged the necessary community constituents, incorporated comprehensive quantitative and qualitative information across its entire CBSA, and fulfilled Commonwealth and Federal Community Benefits requirements. A more detailed summary of the approach and methods that wer e applied across all Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 3 segments of BIDMC's CHNA is included in the full body of this report. More extensive information is available in Appendix A. Key Health -Related Findings This section summarizes the key health -related findings that were identified after a comprehensive review of all the quantitative and qualitative information that was collected across all of BIDMC's assessment efforts. Social Determinants and Health Social Determinants of Health (e.g., economic stability, education, and community/social context) Continue to Have a Massive Impact on Many Segments of the Population. The dominant theme from the assessment's key informant interviews, survey, focus groups and community forums was the continued impact that the underlying social determinants of health are having on the CBSA's low income, underserved, diverse population cohorts. More specifically, determinants such as poverty, employment opportunities, housing, violence, transportation, racial segregation, literacy, provider lingu istic/cultural competency, social support, and community integration limit many people's ability to care for their own and/or their families' health. Disparities in Health Outcomes Exist in BIDMC's CBSA by Race/Ethnicity, Foreign Born Status, Income, and Language: There are major health disparities for residents living in BIDMC's CBSA. This is particularly true for racially/ethnically diverse, foreign born, low income, and non -English speaking residents living in Chelsea and the Boston neighborhoods of All ston/Brighton, Bowdoin/Geneva, Chinatown, Fenway/Kenmore, and Roxbury/Mission Hill. The impact of racism, barriers to care, and disparities in health outcomes that these populations face are widely documented in the literature and confirmed by the data cap tured across all of BIDMC CHNA components. It is crucial that these disparities be addressed and, to this end, BIDMC's Implementation Strategy (IS) continues to include a myriad of programs, strategic interventions, and services that are carefully targeted to address these disparities. However, it is critical to note that there is a multitude of individual, community and societal factors that work together to create these inequities. The underlying issue is not only race/ethnicity, racism, income, o r language but rather a broad array of interrelated social issues including economic opportunity, education, crime, transportation, and community cohesion. Chronic / Complex Conditions and their Risk Factors High Rates of Chronic and Acute Physical Health Conditions (e.g., heart disease, hypertension, cancer, and asthma). The assessment's quantitative data clearly shows that many communities in BIDMC's CBSA have high rates for many of the leading physical health conditions (e.g., heart disease, hypertension, cancer, and asthma). In many communities, these rates are statistically higher than Commonwealth rates, indicating a particularly significant problem. However, even for those communities where the rates are not statistically higher, these conditions are still the leading causes of premature death. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 4 Limited Access to Cancer Screening for Racial/Ethnic Diversity and Other At -risk Populations. Many of the communities that are part of BIDMC's CBSA have high cancer mortality rates. This is particularly true for certain cancers in specific communities in specific Boston neighborhoods, suchas Roxbury, Dorchester, and Chinatown that have a high proportion of racial/ethnic diversity. At the root of addre ssing high mortality is screening, early detection and access to timely treatment. High Rates of the Leading Health Risk Factors (e.g., Lack of Nutritional Food and Physical Activity,Alcohol/Illicit Drug Use, and Tobacco Use). One of the leading findings from the assessment is that many communities and/or population segments in BIDMC's CBSA have high rates of chronic physic al a nd behavioral health conditions. In some people, these conditions have underlying genetic roots that are hard to counter. However, for most people these conditions are widely considered preventable or manageable. Addressing the leading risk factors is at the root of a sound chronic disease prevention and management strategy. Access to Care Limited Access to Primary Care Medical, Medical Specialty, Behavioral Health, and Oral Healt h C are Services for Low Income, Foreign Born, those covered by Medicaid, Uninsured, and Other Vulnerable Populations Facing Health Care Disparities and Barriers to Care. Despite the fact that 1) Massachusett s has one of highest rates of health insurance and 2) the communities that make up BIDMC's CBSA have strong, robust safety net systems, there are still substantial numbers of low income, Medicaid covered, uninsured, and otherwise vulnerable individuals who face health disparities and are not engaged in essential medical, behavioral, and oral health services. Efforts need to be made to expand access, reduce barriers to care, and improve the quality of primary caremedical, medical specialty, behavioral health, and oral health services. Barriers to Access and Disparities in Health Outcomes Continue to Challenge Three SpecialPopulations (Infants/Mothers/Fathers, Frail Older Adults, and Lesbian, Gay, Bi -sexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) Populations. Based on information gathered primarily from the interviews and community forums, the assessment identified a number of special populations thatface barriers to care and disparities in access. More specifically, infants/mothers/fathers, frail olderadults, and the lesbian, gay, bi -sexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) populations face disparities in access and outcome and are particularly at -risk. If these disparities are going to be addressed then care needs to be taken to tailor identification/screening and preventive services as well asacute and chronic disease management services for these special populations. Mental Health and Substance Use High Rates of Substance Use (e.g., Alcohol, Prescription Drug/Opioids, Marijuana) and MentalHealth Issues (e.g., Depression, Anxiety, and Stress). The impact of social determinants was th e l ead finding, but a close second was the profound impact of behavi oral health issues (i.e., substance use and mental health) on individuals, families and communities in every geographic region and every population segment in BIDMC's CBSA. Depression/anxiety, suicide, alcohol use, opioid and prescription drug use, and mar ijuana use are major health issues and are having a significant impactBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 5 on the population as well as a burden on the service system. The fact that physical and behavioral health are so intertwined compounds the impact of these issues. Of parti cular concern are the increasing rates of opioid use and the impacts of trauma. Limited Access to Behavioral Health Services, Particularly for Low Income, Medicaid Covered, Uninsured, Foreign Born, Non- English speakers, and those with Complex/Multi -facete d Issues. Despite the burden of mental health and substance use on all segments of the population, there is an extremely limited service system available to meet the needs that exist for those with mild to moderate episodic issues or those with more seriou s and complex, chronic conditions. Efforts need to be made to expand access, reduce barriers to care (including stigma), and improve the quality o f p rimary care and specialized behavioral health services. Priority Populations BIDMC is committed to improving the health status and well -being of all residents living throughout its CBSA. However, in recognition of the considerable health disparities that exist in some communities, BIDMC focuses the bulk of its community benefits resources on improving the heal th status of low income and underserved populations living in the city of Chelsea and the Boston neighborhoods of Allston/Brighton, Bowdoin/Geneva, Chinatown, Fenway/Kenmore, and Roxbury/Mission Hill. While there are certainly segments of the populations i n Brookline, Chestnut Hill, Lexington, and Needham that are vulnerable and underserved, the greatest disparities exist in Chelsea and Boston. In order to maximize the impact of its community benefits resources, BIDMC's CBC voted to prioritize and focus BIDMC's attention on the more urban, high -need communities in BIDMC's CBSA. Based on the findings from the breadth of BIDMC's assessment activities, further efforts were made to prioritize certain population segments by race/ethnicity, socio -economic status, and other factors. More specifically, the CBC and the Community Benefits Senior Leadership Team (CBSLT) voted to prioritize youth and adolescents, older adults, low -resource individuals and families, LGBTQ populations, racially/ethnically diverse populatio ns, and limited -English speakers. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 6 Youth and Adolescents Older Adults Low Resource Individuals and Families LGBTQ Racially and Ethnically Diverse Populations/non- English speakers Social Determinants of Health Chronic/Complex Conditions and Risk Factors Access to Care Mental Health and Substance Use BIDMC Priority Populations 2020- 2022 Community Health Priorities BIDMC's CHNA is a population -based assessment. The goal was to engage the community and compile quantitative and qualitative information to identify the leading health -related issues affecting individuals throughout the CBSA, in cluding social determinants of health, service gaps, and barriers to care. The priorities that have been identified have been framed broadly to ensure that the full breadth of unmet needs and community health issues are recognized. These priorities were id entified through an integrated and thorough review of all of the quantitative and qualitative information captured across all of the components of BIDMC's CHNA. The priorities have been identified to maximize impact, reduce disparities, and promote collabo ration and cross -sector partnership. During the later stages of the CHNA process, significant efforts were made to vet the priority issues with leadership and the community -at large, through meetings with the CBC and the CBSLT. Based on the findings from t he breadth of BIDMC's CHNA activities, the CBC and the CBSLT voted to prioritize: 1) Social determinants of health, 2) Chronic/complex conditions and their risk factors, 3) Access to care, and 4) Mental health and substance use. BIDMC Priority Areas 2020 -2022 It is important to note that there are community health needs that were identified by BIDMC's assessment that, due to the limited burden that these issues present and/or the feasibility of having an impact in the short - or long -term on these issues, were not prioritized for investment. Namely, transportation and education were identified as community needs but these is sues were deemed by the CBC and the CBSLT to be outside of BIDMC's primary sphere of influence and have opted to allow others Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 7 in its CBSA, the Greater Boston region, and the Commonwealth to focus on these issues. This is not to say that BIDMC will not support efforts in these areas. BIDMC remains open and willing to work with hospitals across Beth Israel Lahey Health's network, with COBTH, and other public and private partners to address these issues, particularly as part of a broad, strong co llaborative. The community health priorities that have been prioritized by the CHNA in the figure above are described in detail below. The goals, objectives and strategic intentions on which BIDMC will focus are included in BIDMC's Implementation Strategy in Appendix F. Summary Implementation Strategy The following outlines BIDMC's goals for addressing the priority populations and community health priorities identified above. Priority Area 1: Social Determinants of Health Goal 1: Increase Physical Activity and Healthy Eating Goal 2: Promote Violence Prevention (Safe Neighborhoods and Community Cohesion) Goal 3: Promote Affordable Housing Goal 4: Promote Home Ownership Goal 5: Support Workforce Development and Creation of Employment Opportunities Goal 6: Promote Environmental Sustainability Priority Area 2: Chronic/Complex Conditions and their Risk Factors Goal 1: Improve Chronic Disease Management Goal 2: Reduce Cancer Disparities (access to screening and treatment) Goal 3: Support Older Adults to Age in Place Priority Area 3: Access to Care Goal 1: Increase Access to Quality Medical Services, Including Primary Care, OB/GYN, and Specialty Care, as well as Urgent, Emergent, and Trauma Care Goal 2: Increase Access to Quality Oral Health Services Goal 3: Promote Equitable Care and Support for those who face cultural and linguistic barriers Goal 4: Promote Greater Health Equity and Reduce Disparities in Access for LGBTQ Populations Priority Area 4: Behavioral Health (Mental Health and Substance Use) Goal 1: Increase Access to Quality Mental Health Care and Substance Use Services Goal 2: Reduce burden of opioid use Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 8 Acknowledgements This report is the culmination of nearly a year of work, involving thousands of community residents, service providers, community advocates, Commonwealth and local public officials, and staff throughout BIDMC, its affiliates, and its community partners. While it was not possible for the assessment to involve all residents and community stakeholders, there were enormous efforts made to ensure that all segments of the community had the opportunity to participate, particularly those that are hard -to-reach and often left out of these types of assessments. BIDMC, including the BIDMC CBC who oversaw this entire process, would like to extend its sincere appreciation to everyone who invested their time, effort, and expertise to ensure the development of the Medical Center's Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) and its Community Health Implementation Strategy (IS). BIDMC would like to extend its special thanks to the Steering Committee of the Boston Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA)- Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) Collaborative (Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative). This collaborative of Boston Area t eaching hospitals and medical centers, community health centers, the Boston Public Health Commission, community based organizations and residents hired Health Resources in Action (HRiA) to support this effort. HRiA spent countless hours working with Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative to create a robust, inclusive, collaborative assessment that involves all of the leading public health, community health, and health care organizations in the City of Boston. In particular, thanks are due to Monica Valdes Lupi, Executive Director of the Boston Public Health Commission, and her staff for providing data, time, and other resources. Per Commonwealth and Federal requirements, local health departments need to be involved in CHNA activities and the Boston Public Health Com mission more than fulfilled this requirement. Special thanks are also due to the North Suffolk Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment (iCHNA) initiative for their support and their contributions to this assessment. BIDMC's Community Advisory Committee (CAC) also supported this assessment. The CAC is made up of community members, service providers, and other key stakeholders that either live in or work in Chelsea and/or the neighborhoods in Boston that are part of the CBSA. The CAC was initially constituted to oversee BIDMC's New Inpatient Building Community -based Health Initiative, and because of their expertise and specific knowledge of Boston they assisted with community engagement and provided valuable insight related to community need. It should al so be noted that the assessment was greatly informed and supported by staff and clinicians at the community health centers who are part of BIDMC's Community Care Alliance (CCA). These health centers are a major part of Boston's health care safety net and d o excellent work on behalf of some of Boston's most underserved populations. The administrative and clinical staff from the health centers provided a great amount of information on community need and helped BIDMC to engage community residents. Finally, BIDMC's Community Benefits Staff and Senior Leadership would like to acknowledge the great work, support, and commitment of the BIDMC CBC. The CBC oversaw every aspect of the needs assessment across all facets. BIDMC owes a tremendous debt of gratitude to eve ry member of the CBC. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 9 Over the years, the BIDMC CBC membership has provided their expertise and invested hundreds of hours of their time to engage the community, align BIDMC's efforts with community need, and ensure the strength and impact of the Medical Center's Community Benefits Program. The work of the CBC has ultimately strengthened the BIDMC's connections with the people and the communities it serves. It is also abundantly clear that the Community Health Needs Assessment Report provided below, along with the associated Implementation Strategy, would not be as strong were it not for the CBC's commitment and the contributions of all of its members.

Appendix E: Contact Information for BIDMC Community Benefits BIDMC Summary Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 14 Introduction Background Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) is one of the nation's preeminent academic medical centers and is nationally recognized for its world -class clinical expertise, education and research. BIDMC is part of the newly formed Beth Israel Lahey Health (BILH) - a system of academic medical centers, teaching hospitals, community ho spitals, and specialty hospitals that combined, employ more than 4,000 physicians and 35,000 staff members. BIDMC is one of BILH's premier institutions with 673 licensed beds and over 1,200 active physicians. The Medical Center is also a Level 1 trauma cen ter with a full range of medical/surgical, critical care, OB/GYN, and emergency services, and an extensive network of primary care and outpatient specialty care practices. BIDMC prides itself on its ability to combine exceptional, compassionate patient care with advanced medical knowledge, research, and technology in ways that allow it to achieve the best outcomes for its patients. In addition to its commitment to clinical excellence, BIDMC is committed to being an active partner and collaborator in the com munities it serves. Community service is at the core of the traditions of both of BIDMC's founding hospitals, Beth Israel Hospital and the New England Deaconess Hospital, and remains an important part of its mission today. BIDMC has a covenant to care for the underserved and works to address disparities in health care access and outcomes across the communities and population segments it serves. BIDMC also recognizes its role as a tertiary/academic resource in a larger health system, and knows that to be suc cessful it needs to collaborate with community partners. This Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) and the associated Implementation Strategy (IS) were completed in close collaboration with BIDMC's staff, health and social service partners, and the com munity at -large. In total, the assessment efforts engaged thousands of community residents, as well as a wide range of other stakeholders, including service providers, community advocates, Commonwealth and local public officials, faith leaders, and represe ntatives from community -based organizations. The process that was applied in the development of the approach, methods, and community engagement strategies for the assessments and Implementation Strategy exemplifies the spirit of collaboration and community engagement that is such a vital part of BIDMC's mission. Purpose This community health needs assessment report is an integral part of BIDMC's population health and community engagement efforts. It supplies vital information that is applied to make sure that the services and programs that BIDMC provides are appropriately focused, delivered in ways that are responsive to those in its CBSA, and address unmet community needs. This assessment and the associated prioritization and planning processes also provide a critical opportunity for BIDMC to engage the community and to strengthen the community partnerships that are essential to BIDMC's success now and in the future. This report also allows BIDMC to meet its Commonwealth and Federal Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 15 Community Benefits requirements per the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office (MA AGO) and the Federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as part of the Affordable Care Act. The primary goals for the CHNA and this report are to: Assess community health need, defined broadly to include health status, social determinants, environmental factors, and service system strengths and weaknesses; Engage the community, including local health departments, service providers across sectors and community residents, as well as BIDMC leadership and staff; and Identify the leading health issues and the population segments most at -risk based on a review of the quantitative and qualitative information gathered by the assessment This CHNA is also a vital source of information and guidance to: Clarify issues related to community characteristics, barriers to care, existing service gaps, unmet community need and other health -related factors; Prioritize and promote community health investment; Inform and guide a comprehensive, collaborative community health improvement planning process; and Facilitate discussion within and across and sectors regarding community need, community health improvement, and health equity Community Benefits Service Area & Community Benefits Priorities In addition to the Medical Center in the Longwood area of Boston, BIDMC operates licensed multi- specialty outpatient facilities in Chelsea, Lexington, and Chestnut Hill, a cancer center in Needham, and a pain center in Brookline. BIDMC also operates a licensed health center in Bowdoin/Geneva and has strong, long- standing partnerships with an additional four Boston Federally Qualified Health Centers (Figure 1) Figure 2: BIDMC Community Benefits Service Area (CBSA) Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 16 within its Co mmunity Benefits Service Area (CBSA). Through this health center network, BIDMC's Community Benefits Department supports community health improvement activities that meet the needs of all segments of the population with respect to age, race/ethnicity, inc ome, language, country of origin, immigration status, language, sexual orientation and gender identity. The communities in which these facilities operate define BIDMC's CBSA and all of the communities in Figure 1 were included in the assessment. In recognition of the considerable health disparities that exist in some communities, BIDMC focuses the bulk of its community benefits resources on improving the health status of low income and underserved populations living in the city of Chelsea and the Bos ton neighborhoods of Allston/Brighton, Bowdoin/Geneva, Chinatown, Fenway/Kenmore, and Roxbury/Mission Hill. While there are certainly segments of the populations in Chestnut Hill, Lexington, and Needham that are vulnerable and underserved, the greatest dis parities exist in Chelsea and Boston. In order to maximize the impact of its community benefits resources, BIDMC's CBC voted to prioritize and focus BIDMC's attention on the more urban, high -need communities in BIDMC's CBSA. By the same token, there are co mmunity health needs that were identified by the assessment that, due to the limited burden that these issues present and/or the feasibility of having an impact in the short - term or long -term, were not prioritized for investment. The goals, objectives and strategic intentions on which BIDMC will focus are included in BIDMC's Implementation Strategy in Appendix F. BIDMC currently supports and collaborates on dozens of educational, outreach, and community - strengthening initiatives aimed at reaching those wh o live in its CBSA. In the course of these efforts, BIDMC collaborates with many of Boston's leading healthcare, public health, and social service organizations. BIDMC has particularly strong relationships with the community health centers (CHCs) that oper ate in its CBSA, all of which are affiliated with BIDMC's Community Care Alliance (CCA). These health centers are key community benefits partners as they are rooted in their communities and are dedicated to treating those who are traditionally underserved. These CHC partners have been a vital part of BIDMC's community health strategy since 1968, when Beth Israel Hospital first joined forces with The Dimock Center to address maternal and child health issues. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 17 Summary of Approach and Methods In conducting this assessment and planning process, it would be difficult to overstate BIDMC's commitment to community engagement and a robust, collaborative, transparent, and objective process. Rather than conducting one -single assessment, BIDMC's Community Benefits staff dedicated countless hours of their time and other resources to participate in and gather information from a series of three concurrent and comprehensive assessments. These three assessments were conducted by organizations or collectives of organizations throughout Boston and Chelsea. BIDMC also integrated the extensive community engagement and planning work that BIDMC is conducting as part of its Massachusetts Determination of Need New Inpatient Building Community -based Health Initiative. Invo lvement in these four efforts allowed BIDMC to leverage resources, and create a robust and inclusive CHNA and IS process. Involvement in these concurrent assessments also facilitated important collaboration between BIDMC and health service organizations ac ross Boston. These partners were very productive and will have a lasting positive impact when it comes to future assessments and community health improvement efforts. In October of 2019, BIDMC hired John Snow, Inc. (JSI), a public health consulting firm ba sed in Boston to integrate the information gathered across these concurrent assessments and augment the information gathered where appropriate. BIDMC worked with JSI to ensure that the final BIDMC CHNA, including elements across all of its separate parts, engaged the necessary community constituents, incorporated comprehensive quantitative and qualitative information for all of the communities in its CBSA, and fulfilled Commonwealth and Federal Community Benefits requirements. BIDMC's CBC oversaw all aspect s of the assessment and planning process and was integral to the development of the CHNA report and the implementation strategy. The assessment was also supported by BIDMC's Community Advisory Committee (CAC), which was initially constituted to oversee BID MC's New Access Building Community -based Health Initiative. Both the CBC and CAC are made up of community members, service providers, and other key stakeholders that either live in and/or work with the neighborhoods in Boston that are part of BIDMC's CBSA. The expertise and knowledge that these groups brought to the process was invaluable. The following are brief descriptions of each of the component parts of BIDMC's overall assessment. More detailed descriptions of the specific approaches and methods that were applied across these component parts are included in Appendix A. Collectively, the efforts described below exemplify BIDMC's commitment to a comprehensive, inclusive, engaged, collaborative assessment and planning process. The efforts also show BIDMC's commitment to understanding unmet need, the underlying social determinants of health, and community engagement. All of these processes put a particular emphasis on engaging hard to reach population segments that are often left out of these types of activities. BIDMC is extremely proud of its efforts over the past year. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 18 Boston Community Health Needs Assessment -Community Health Improvement Plan Collaborative (Boston CHNA-CHIP Collaborative) BIDMC's Community Benefits staff participated and took a leadership role in the development and implementation of a collaborative citywide community health needs assessment involving dozens of service providers and the Boston Public Health Commission. This assessment, called the Boston CHNA - CHIP Collaborative (Boston Community Health Needs Assessment - Community Health Improvement Plan Collaborative) was facilitated through the Conference of Boston Teaching Hospitals (COBTH) and was an enormous, unprecedented effort between twelve Boston area teaching hospitals and academic medical centers, numerous community health centers, the Boston Public Health Commission, other community based organizations and community residents. The assessment focused on the social determinants of health through the lens of health equity; it aimed to uncover and understand how and why individuals in certain Boston neighborhoods or population groups experience disparities in health outcomes and barriers to care based on socioeconomic status, race and ethnicity, language, health status, sexual orientation, gender identity, and other factors. The overall approach was participatory and collaborative, engaging community residents and stakeholders throughout the CHNA process. Nancy Kasen, BIDMC's Director of Community Benefits, co -chaired the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Steering Committee and served on many of the CHNA Workgroups (Community Engagement, Secondary Data, and Planning). The Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative collected and analyzed secondary data on a wide range of issues from a variety of sources to identify community characteristics, barriers to care, risk factors, and disparities in health outcomes. There was a particular focus on collecting data to characterize the social determinants of health (e.g., housing, transportation, and socioeconomic status) and to stratify data by Boston neighborhood, as well as by race/ethnicity, age, income, and other characteristics. The assessment also included a robust community engagement and qualitative information gathering effort, includ ing a community health survey, focus groups, and key informant interviews. The community health survey collected information on leading social determinants, barriers to care, and health status issues. More than 2,404 residents of Boston completed these. 104 people participated in thirteen focus groups conducted with specific populations of interest, which delved deeply into unmet community needs, strengths, and opportunities for the future. 45 key informant interviews were completed that engaged institutional, organizational, and community leaders and front -line staff across sectors. Discussions explored interviewees' experiences of addressing community needs and opportunities for future alignment, coordination, and expansion of services, initiatives, and policies. The Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative also conducted an extensive series of prioritization and planning meetings to facilitate the development of a citywide Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP). Finally, the Boston CHNA- CHIP Collaborative developed a summary and full report of findings, which was drawn on extensively to develop this report. Additional information on the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative is provided in Appendix A. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 19 North Suffolk Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment (iCHNA) BIDMC staff also participated in and leveraged the efforts of the North Suffolk Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment (iCHNA). The iCHNA was a comprehensive assessment and planning effort, which gathered information from a broad geographic area to the north of Boston, including Chelsea. The iCHNA was overseen by a Steering Committee comprised of municipal leaders, community organizations, and representatives from the five health systems that serve the North Suffolk region. Kelina Orlando, BIDMC Executive Director of Ambulatory Operations served on the iCHNA Steering Committee and participated in the primary data collection process. The Steering Committee was responsible for monitoring the completion of assessment tasks, coordinatin g communication efforts with key stakeholders and the public at -large, and making final decisions on priority areas and strategies. The assessment was comprehensive in nature, including quantitative data gathered from the U.S. Census, Massachusetts Departm ent of Education, Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH), local Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), Prevention Needs Assessment (PNA), local police departments and community -based organizations. Qualitative information was gathered through a quali ty of life survey , which collected information from more than 1,800 respondents. Information was also gathered through focus groups and key informant interviews . In total, the iCHNA effort organized 22 focus groups with service providers and conducted 28 i n-depth interviews with key stakeholders. The Steering Committee also engaged in a series of meetings that allowed them to understand key assessment findings, identify community health priorities and priority populations for investment, and develop the CHN A Report and Implementation Strategy. Additional information on the iCHNA is provided in Appendix A. Beth Israel Lahey Health (BILH) and Other Hospital Community Health Needs Assessments BIDMC leveraged information from numerous hospitals within the BILH s ystem (i.e., New England Baptist Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital - Needham, and Lahey Hospital Medical Center,) as well as other hospitals in Boston (i.e., Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana- Farber Cancer Institute, Boston Children's Hospital). Th ese hospitals operate in BIDMC CBSA and, as a result, efforts were made to share information and align community engagement and assessment activities. Qualitative information was gathered through a community meeting in Mission Hill/Roxbury that was jointly hosted by BIDMC and New England Baptist Hospital (NEBH), along with Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston Children's Hospital and Dana -Farber Cancer Institute. Qualitative information from key informant interviews and meetings involving residents and key s takeholders in Lexington was shared by Lahey Hospital Medical Center in Burlington. Qualitative information was gathered through a community health survey , which collected information from more than 100 residents of Mission Hill. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 20 Information was also gathered through focus groups and key informant interviews . In total, the NEBH CHNA effort organized two focus groups involving more than 20 people and conducted 12 in-depth interviews with key stakeholders. Additional information on t hese assessment activities is provided in Appendix A. BIDMC Determination of Need: New Inpatient Building Community Health Initiative (CHI) In addition to the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative, the iCHNA, and numerous hospital CHNA efforts, BIDMC conducted co mmunity engagement, assessment, and prioritization activities through its Determination of Need, New Inpatient Building Community -based Health Initiative (CHI). BIDMC is in the process of constructing a new inpatient building - the first new building that BIDMC has built in over 20 years. Due to the size of this capital expenditure, the MDPH requires that BIDMC go through a Determination of Need (DoN) process; this process directs BIDMC to dedicate 5% of total project costs towards a Community -based Health Initiative (CHI) to improve the health of residents in communities that are part of the BIDMC's CBSA. Over the next five to eight years, BIDMC will invest approximately $30 million towards the CHI project. $7.5 Million (25%) of BIDMC's $30 Million will be given to the Commonwealth and be invested in Commonwealth -wide community health improvement initiatives. The remaining $22.5 Million will be allocated and directed by BIDMC's CAC in community health improvement initiatives in BIDMC's CBSA neighborhoods in Boston and Chelsea. Per Commonwealth DoN requirements, BIDMC is required to implement a robust community engagement effort and facilitate a prioritization process with BIDMC's CAC to identify the leading community health priorities as well as the communities and priority population segments that will be supported by BIDMC's CHI funds. A series of five (5) community meetings were held in the Boston neighborhoods that are part of BIDMC's CBSA, and approximately 185 community residents attended. The primary go al of these meetings was to ensure that residents of BIDMC's CBSA in Boston, as well as staff from community -based organizations that operate in those areas, were given the opportunity to learn about the CHI, share their ideas on how CHI funds should be sp ent, and vote on community health priorities and strategic ideas for funding. Special efforts were made to include non - English speaking residents and other hard -to-reach segments of the population who are often left out of community engagement activities in the community engagement meetings. With respect to prioritization and planning, the BIDMC CAC met eight times between October 2019 and July 2019 to develop the CHI engagement and prioritization plans, as well as to more substantively discuss and agree o n priority communities, priority populations, segments of the population that are hard -to-reach, and community health sub -priorities or categories for investment. In September and October 2019, the BIDMC CAC will continue to meet to decide on the specific details of its CHI allocation strategy. This will dictate what types of activities will be supported, what communities will be the focus of CHI investments, and how funds will be distributed. Information drawn for the community meetings and the CAC deliberations were integrated into BIDMC's CHNA and IS. Additional information on the CHI is provided in Appendix A. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 21 BIDMC CBSA Assessment As mentioned above, in October of 2018, BIDMC hired JSI to integrate the information gathered across the concu rrent assessment and planning activities discussed above and augment the information gathered where necessary. BIDMC's additional efforts ensured that BIDMC's CHNA engaged the necessary community constituents, incorporated information from all of the commu nities in its CBSA, and fulfilled Commonwealth and Federal Community Benefits requirements. Figure 3 below provides a summary of the quantitative and qualitative assessment activities conducted for each of the assessment efforts. Figure 3: BIDMC Assessment Activities 2018- 2019 Methods Summary of Methods Applied Across all Assessment Components Quantitative Data Demographic/Socio -economic Data (e.g., Age, gender, race/ethnicity, language, income) Social Determinants of Health Data (e.g., Housing Transportation, crime) Epidemiologic Data (e.g., Disease prevalence, morbidity and mortality) Hospital Discharge Data (e.g., Discharge Rates and Prevention Quality Indicators1 Qualitative Data / Community Engagement Key Informant Interviews ~ 70 interviews with health and social service providers, public health officials, advocates, residents, and other community Stakeholders Community Health Survey Responses ~ 4,500 survey responses from community residents Focus Groups ~ 16 focus groups with key population segments (e.g., Black/African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, LGBTQ, or service provider groups) Community Meetings ~ 15 community meetings open to the public in neighborhoods across Boston and Chelsea BIDMC's additional, independent assessment and planning activities were conducted in three phases. First, BIDMC collected, analyzed and integrated additional quantitative data from various sources to ensure that all of the communities that are part of BIDMC's CBSA were included in the as sessment (Phase I). In this case, particular attention was made to gather information from the communities that are part of BIDMC's CBSA that are outside of Boston and Chelsea. Namely, BIDMC operates a pain center in Brookline, a Cancer Center in Needham, and an outpatient, multi -specialty clinic in Lexington. Second, BIDMC engaged additional community residents, key stakeholders, and service providers through key informant interviews (Phase II). Third, BIDMC integrated and prioritized the findings compiled and analyzed across all of the various concurrent assessment activities (Phase III). Once the findings were prioritized, BIDMC then worked with JSI to develop this report and the associated Implementation Strategy (Phase III). 1 PQIs are a set of measur es that use hospital discharge data to identify quality of care for \"ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACS).\" These are conditions that can potentially be prevented or avoided given early intervention and appropriate levels of outpatient primary or spe cialty care. https://www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/modules/pqi_overview.aspx Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 22 It should be noted that this report relies heavily on information gathered from the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative, the iCHNA, NEBH, Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital - Needham, and the other hospital partners referenced above as part of their community health assessment efforts. In order to reduce duplication of effort and fully leverage resources, information was drawn directly from the CHNA reports developed by these organizations. BIDMC wants to recognize the efforts of all who shared information but feels particularly obliged to recognize the efforts of the iCHNA and the Boston CHNA - CHIP Collaborative due to the magnitude of information that was shared from these efforts and reported in this document. Special thanks to Health Resources in Action (HRiA) who was hired by the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative to support their assessment an d reporting efforts. In some cases, information has been drawn from the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative and iCHNA reports and included verbatim in this document. Following is more detailed descriptions of the leadership and oversight of BIDMC's CHNA, additional data collection efforts, and the prioritization process, as well as the Resource Inventory and the Community Benefits Evaluation. Leadership and Oversight. As mentioned above, BIDMC's CBSA CHNA, including the collective efforts with the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative, the iCHNA, and numerous other hospitals within and outside of BILH, were overseen by the CBC. The CBC is comprised of key community stakeholders and BIDMC leadership and provided valuable insight on the assessment approach, including the community engagement strategy, preliminary findings, and strategic planning. The CAC also supported BIDMC's CHNA by providing their knowledge and experience living in or work with the neighborhoods of Boston and Chelsea. It is also important to note that BIDMC's Community Benefits Senior Leadership Team (CBSLT) played a critical role in the assessment and planning process. They were consulted throughout the assessment and, along with the CBC, were instrumental in the prioritization and planning process. The CBLT included key BIDMC administrators and clinicians. Quantitative and Qualitative Data Collection. BIDMC's CBSA CHNA includes an extensive amount of additional quantitative and qualitative data that further characterize the communities in BIDMC's CBSA, including the health status of its residents. This data was used to augment data from existing assessments, particularly for communities in Boston and Chelsea. It was also used to capture information from communities in BIDMC's CBSA that are outside of Bos ton and Chelsea, in the surrounding communities of Brookline, Chestnut Hill, Lexington, and Needham. Since Chestnut Hill is not a registered municipality, data is reported for the communities that comprise it (Boston, Brookline, and Newton). Secondary data sources included: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates (2013 -2017) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey, 2017 Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education: School and District Profiles(2017, and 2018 -2019 ) FBI Uniform Crime Reports (2017) Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Registry of Vital Records and Statistics (2015) Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Bureau of Substance Abuse Services (2017) Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Annual Reports on Births (2016)Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 23 Massachusetts Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences (2017) Massachusetts Center for Health Information Analysis (CHIA) Hospital Profiles (FY 2013 -2017) Massachusetts Center for Health Information Analysis (CHIA) Hospital Discharges (2017) Massachusetts Healthy Aging Collaborative, Community Profiles (2018) Whenever possible, confidence intervals were analyzed to test for statistically significant differences between municipal and Commonwealth data points. BIDMC CHNA also included some more refined analysis of hospital discharge data compiled by the Massachusetts Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA). This analysis focused on analyzing Ambulatory Care Sensitive conditions, which allow fo r the assessment of the strength of a community's primary care system and its ability to prevent or avoid hospitalizations. A comprehensive Data Book is included in Appendix B. BIDMC's CBSA assessment also collected a limited amount of qualitative informat ion to augment the considerable amount of information collected from the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative, the iCHNA, other hospital CHNA activities, and BIDMC's CHI. This qualitative data gathering focused on filling gaps in information in Brookline, Lexing ton, Needham, and Chestnut Hill, which were not covered by the iCHNA and the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative. Data sources, associated tools, lists of participants, and other materials are included in Appendix A with other more detailed information on the BIDMC CBSA approach and the CBSA Detailed Community Engagement Summary in Appendix C. Prioritization. During Phases I and II, BIDMC's CBC was provided updates on the CBSA assessment to keep them informed of progress and our preliminary findings. In Phase II , a prioritization meeting was held with BIDMC's CBC. During this meeting, quantitative and qualitative data findings, including information from the Boston CHNA- CHIP Collaborative assessment, the iCHNA, the NEBH CHNA, and the BIDMC CHI were reviewed. The CBC then participated in a robust discussion of all of the findings and based on this discussion, voted to approve a set of community health priorities and priority population segments that would be used to develop BIDMC's implementation strategy. Followin g the CBC planning and prioritization meeting, a similar meeting was organized with BIDMC's CBSLT. During this meeting, the CBSLT also reviewed key findings from across all of the concurrent assessment activities as well as priorities agreed on by the CBC. Based on this discussion they voted on a set of priorities that were incorporated into BIDMC's CHNA and the IS. Approval/Adoption and Public Comment. The CHNA and IS were distributed and presented to the CBC on September 5, 2019 and, with their approval, presented to the Board of Directors for approval on September 18, 2019. As with every CHNA, BIDMC's 2019 CHNA has been made dmc.org/about -bidmc/helping- our-community/community - initiatives/community -benefits). Comments are welcome and encouraged and contact information for BIDMC's Director of Community Benefits is both on the website and in Appendix E of this report. There were no written comments or oral comments received on BIDMC's prior (FY 2016) CHNA or IS. Resource Inventory. Federal and Commonwealth requirements indicate that a Resource Inventory should be created to inform the extent to which there are gaps in health -related services. Working with BIDMC, JSI compiled a list of resources across the broad continuum of services, including clinical health care services, community health and social services, and public health resources. This was done Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 24 primarily by compiling information from existing resource inventories and community partner lists from BIDMC. Information was also compiled from membership lists of the existing community health coalitions and from CHNA interviews. JSI reviewed BIDMC's FY 2018 Annual R eport of Community Benefits activities submitted to the MA AGO, which included a listing of partners, as well as publicly available lists of local resources. The goal of this process was to identify key partners who may or may not be already collaborating with BIDMC. The resource inventory can be found in Appendix D. Community Benefits Evaluation. BIDMC's contract with JSI included funds to conduct a community benefits evaluation that assessed the impact of BIDMC existing community benefits activities. More specifically, JSI staff reviewed the Fiscal Year 2017 Community Benefits Report that BIDMC submitted to the MA AGO in April 2018. Activities reported in this report were abstracted and individually scored. JSI determined the intensity of each activity by coding three specific attributes according to a proven methodology developed by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The three attributes are: Behavioral Intention: Providing information; enhancing skills, services, or support; modifying access, and opportunities; modifying policies and broader conditions; Duration: One-time, occurring more than once, or ongoing; and Reach: Proportion -high, medium, low of the total priority population involved in or touched through the activity A JSI evaluation tea m member rated each activity attribute on a scale of 0.1 (minimum) to 1.0 (maximum) and calculated a single intensity score using a defined protocol (Table 1). A second evaluation team member coded a randomly selected number of activities to ensure inter -rater reliability. A score of 0.1 - 0.5 was given dependent upon how many times and/or how long the activity was implemented during FY2017. If the duration or reach was unclear, the evaluators scored the attribute the lowest possible score (0.1). The formul a used to calculate an intensity score for each activity was: Behavioral value + duration value + reach value Scores could range from 0.3 (lowest intensity and least likely to impact long -term outcomes) to 3.0 (highest intensity and most likely to impact long -term outcomes). A total composite score for all activities was then summed across all activities. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 25 Table 1: Community Benefits Evaluation Scoring Protocol A more detailed summary of the Community Benefits Evaluation is included in Appendix G. Community Engagement As discussed above, community engagement is integral to BIDMC's mission and great efforts were taken to ensure that all of the concurrent assessment activities implemented over the past year included substantial effort s to engage community residents and other community stakeholders. These engagement efforts spanned all phases of the assessment from assessment planning, to data collection, to prioritization and planning, to reporting, and finally to on going monitoring and evaluation. BIDMC recognizes the importance of collaborating with residents, advocates, service providers, Commonwealth and local public officials, representatives from community -based organizations, and other stakeholders when conducting assessment and planning projects of this kind. In collaboration with its assessment and community engagement partners, BIDMC applied MDPH's Community Engagement Standards for Community Health Planning as a guide. 2 As a result, BIDMC employed a variety of strategies to ensure that community members were informed, consulted, involved, and empowered throughout the assessment process. 2 https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2017/01/vr/guidelines -community -engagement.pdf Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 26 Figure 4: Community Engagement Continuum Table 2 includes a description of the goal for each level of community engagement, examples of activities and strategies within each level, and associated activities undertaken by BIDMC and assessment partners, including the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative, the iCHNA, and other hospital partners within BILH and in Boston. Table 2: Communi ty Engagement Activities across the Continuum Inform: Provide community with balanced and objective information to assist them in understanding the problem, alternatives, opportunities, and/or solutions Examples: Fact sheets, web sites, open houses BIDMC CHI Engagement: A web site was developed to inform the community on the CHI purpose, activities, and findings. Community Advisory Committee meeting agendas, materials, and minutes were posted for the public to access. Boston CHNA- CHIP Collaborative: A web site was developed to keep the public informed of the assessment process and opportunities for involvement. iCHNA: A web site was developed to keep the public informed of the assessment process and opportunities for involvement. Consult: To obtain community feedback on analysis, alternatives, and/or solutions Examples: Public comments, focus groups, surveys, community meetings BIDMC CBSA Assessment: Key informant interviews were conducted with BIDMC leadership and community stakeholders. BIDMC CHI Engagement: Community meetings were held in each of the CBSA Boston neighborhoods. Boston CHNA- CHIP Collaborative: Key informant interviews, focus groups, a survey, and community meetings were conducted to consult community residents and stakehol ders on community health issues iCHNA: Key informant interviews, focus groups, and a survey were conducted to consult community residents and stakeholders on community health issues Involve: To work directly with community throughout the process to ensure their concerns and aspirations are consistently understood and considered Examples: Workshops, deliberative polling, advisory bodies BIDMC CHI Engagement: At community meetings, participants were engaged to prioritize community health issues. The results of these prioritization processes were used to arrive at a set of final community health Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 27 priorities. Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative: An integrated analysis of findings from quantitative and qualitative data was done to arrive at a set of preliminary community health priorities. Through a series of meetings with community residents and stakeholders, a final set of priorities were developed. Community residents and stakeholders were also involved in determining goals, objectives, and strategies within each priority area. Additionally, the Boston Public Health Commission organized four Community Health Prioritization Meetings in Roxbury and Mattapan to gather information on the leading health- related issues. iCHNA: At the focus groups, participants were engaged and asked questions regarding their perceptions about the health of the community, community assets, and pressing health issues. BILH and other hospital partners: Focus groups and community meetings were conducted by hospital within the BILH system (i.e., New England Baptist Hospital (NEBH), Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital - Needham, and Lahey Hospital Medical Center) and other hospital partners in Boston as part of hospital CHNA activities. Community and stakeholder participants we re involved in discussions and engaged to prioritize community health issues. The results of these information gathering and prioritization processes were used to arrive at a set of final community health priorities. Collaborate: To partner with the commu nity in each aspect of the decision including the development of alternatives & identification of the preferred solution Examples: Advisory groups, consensus building, participatory decision making Community Care Alliance (CCA): CCA works in close partnership with a network of private, independent, community health centers in Boston, called the Community Care Alliance. BIDMC created this network and supports their activities through technical assistance and direct financial support. BIDMC's Communit y Benefits Staff oversees the activities of the CCA and, relative to the assessment participated in monthly progress reports to get their input on the assessment and its findings. BIDMC CBSA Assessment: The assessment was overseen by a Community Benefits C ommittee, comprised of community residents and stakeholders. This body collaborated to make decisions regarding the assessment approach and priority health issues BIDMC CHI Engagement: Community residents and stakeholders were included on the CHI Community Advisory Committee. This body was tasked with making decisions regarding engagement approach and strategies, prioritization of issues, and allocation of funds. Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative: The CHNA used a participatory, collaborative approach that enga ged the community through different avenues. Over 100 Collaborative members representing health care, public health, education, community development, social service, and community- based organizations provided input throughout the CHNA process and played a n integral role in data collection efforts. Data collection efforts were focused on engaging hard -to-reach populations who are not typically engaged in these processes or represented in the secondary data. iCHNA: Focus group participants and key informants were identified by the North Suffolk Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment Steering Committee using a segment inclusiveness worksheet to ensure that a variety of diverse individuals across multiple sectors and populations were included. BILH and ot her hospital partners: Focus groups and community meetings were conducted as part of hospital CHNA activities, participants were involved in discussions and engaged to prioritize community health issues. The results of these information gathering and prior itization processes were used to arrive at a set of final community health priorities. Specifically, BIDMC and NEBH, along with Boston Children's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Dana -Farber Cancer Institute, jointly hosted a forum in Mission Hi ll/Roxbury to involve and collaborate with the community on the identification of priorities. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 28 Empower: To place the decision making in the hands of the community Examples: Advisory bodies, volunteer stipends, ballots, delegated decisions BIDMC CHI Engagement: The Community Advisory Committee, made up of community residents and stakeholders, were tasked with making decisions regarding prioritization of issues and allocation of resources. During this process, a series of community engagement meetings were organized with community - based organizations and in a number of cases staff members from these organizations were trained and provided stipends to guide discussions in facilitated sessions or \"focus groups\". Their participation enhanced dis cussions and built their capacity. Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative: Community members, residents and service providers, were empowered throughout the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative's activities to participate and in many ways help facilitate and guide discussions. Focus group participants were also provided with stipends and childcare during data collection activities. Additionally, the organizing organizations of each focus group were compensated. Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative also paid the Healthy Community Champions to distribute the community survey. Community Driven/Led: To support the actions of community initiated, driven and/or led processes Examples: Community supported processes, advisory bodies, stipend roles for communities, funding for communities Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative: Focus group participants were provided a stipend and childcare during data collection. Additionally, organizations who hosted the event were compensated. Healthy Community Champions were also provided a stipend to help distribute the community survey. The Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative also conducted key informant interview and meeting facilitation trainings for representatives from organizations that are part of the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative. iCHNA: Focus g roup participants were provided a $15 gift card - adults received Market Basket gift cards and youth received Amazon or Target gift cards. BIDMC CHI Community Engagement: CHI efforts included a series of community meetings hosted by community -based organizations in BIDMC's CBSA. Host organizations were if they were interested and able to help facilitate breakout sessions at the meetings. Those who agreed to participate were provided a Facilitators Guide and required to participate in a 1- hour training on facilitation and non- directive interview techniques. Participants were provided a stipend for their participation and assistance in these efforts. Key Findings: Demographics As mentioned above in the approach and methods section, this report relies heavily on information gathered from the Boston CHNA- CHIP Collaborative, the iCHNA, NEBH, Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital - Needham, and the other hospital partners referenced above as part of their community health assessment efforts. In order to reduce duplication of effort and fully leverage resources, information in this report was drawn directly from the CHNA reports developed by these organizations. BIDMC wants to recognize the efforts of all who shared information but feels particularly obliged to recognize the efforts of the iCHNA and the Boston CHNA- CHIP Collaborative due to the magnitude of information that was shared from these efforts and reported in this document. Special thanks to Health Resources in Action (HRiA) who was hired by the Boston CHNA- CHIP Collaborative to support their assessment and reporting Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 29 efforts. In some cases, information has been drawn from the Boston CHNA- CHIP Collaborative and iCHNA repor ts and included verbatim in this document. The following section contains a comprehensive description of the BIDMC CBSA population's geographic and demographic characteristics. This information is critical knowledge in order to recognize inequities, identify priority populations and health related disparities, and target strategic responses. All assessment efforts captured a range of quantitative and qualitative data related to age, race, ethnicity, origin, and language. The following is a summary of key findings related to these community characteristics. Conclusions were drawn from collected quantitative data and qualitative information as part of each assessment process. A key finding from this assessment was that health disparities and needs were more pronounced in Boston (as a whole, and at the neighborhood level), and in the City of Chelsea. As such, key findings in this document will be reported in two parts: Boston and Chelsea, and surrounding communities (Brookline, Chestnut Hill, Lexington, and N eedham). Since Chestnut Hill is not a registered municipality, data is reported for the communities that comprise it (Boston, Brookline, and Newton). Population and Age Distribution Age is a fundamental factor to consider when assessing individual and com munity health status. Older individuals typically have more physical and mental health vulnerabilities and are more likely to rely on immediate community resources for support compared to young people. Boston and Chelsea The population growth rate in all BIDMC CBSA neighborhoods increased between 2008 -2012 and 2013 - 2017; Roxbury has seen the largest increase (17.1%) (Table 3). Among CBSA neighborhoods: Dorchester is one of the neighborhoods with the highest proportion of residents under 18 Fenway has a sm all percentage of residents under 18 (3.9%), but has a large proportion of young adults aged 18 -24 (58.7%) Table 3: Population in Boston and Neighborhoods, 2008- 2012 and 2013- 2017 2008 -2012 2013 -2017 Percent 17.1 Source: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2008 -2012 and 2013- 2017 In Chelsea, over one in four residents is under 18 (26%), a small proportion (9%) are over the age of 65.

Race and Ethnicity An extensive body of research illustrates the health disparities and differences in health care access and utiliz ation that exist for diverse individuals/cohorts and foreign -born populations. According to the CDC, Black/African American, non- Hispanic/Latinos have higher rates of premature death, infant mortality and preventable hospitalization than do White, non -Hisp anics/Latinos.3 Hispanics/Latinos have the highest uninsured rates of any racial or ethnic group in the United States.4 Asian, non -Hispanic/Latinos 3 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \"CDC Health Disparities and Inequalities Report (CHDIR),\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Web Site, https: //ww w.cdc.gov/minorityhealth/chdireport.html, September 10, 2015 4 US Department of Health and Human Services: Office of Minority Health. Hispanic/Latino Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 31 are at a higher risk for developing diabetes than those of European ancestry, despite a lower average BMI.5 These disparities show the disproportionate and often avoidable inequities that exist within communities and reinforce the importance of understanding the demographic makeup of a community to identify populations more likely to experience adverse health outcomes. Boston and Chelsea Boston is diverse, with 23% of residents identifying as Black/African American, non -Hispanic/Latino, 19% identifying as Hispanic/Latino, and 9% identifying as Asian, non -Hispanic/Latino. While Bost on's population increased by 8% between 2012 and 2017, the percentage of Hispanic/Latino residents increased by 20%.6 Among the neighborhoods in BIDMC's CBSA: Black/African American, non- Hispanic/Latino residents make up a larger proportion of the populati on in Roxbury (40.8%) and Dorchester (44.8% and (22.7%) Fenway (18.3%) and Allston/Brighton (17.7%) are among the neighborhoods with the highestproportion of Asian, non -Hispanic/Latino residents Hispanic/Latino residents make up a larger proportion of the population in the 02121 and 02125 zip codes in Dorchester (24.6%) and Roxbury (27.3%) compared to Boston overall (19.4%) Table 5: Race/Ethnicity by Boston Neighborhood, 2013- 2017 Asian, Non - Hispanic/Latino Black, Non - Hispanic/Latino U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2013 -2017 NOTE: Neighborhoods as defined by Boston Public Health Commission; South End includes South End and Chinatown; Latino includes residents who identify as Latino regardless of race and racial categories include residents who do not identify as Latino; Other includes American Indian and Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, Some other race, and Two or more races; NA denotes where data not presented due to insufficient sample size In Chelsea, the percentage of residents who identify as Hispanic or Latino is 66%, compared to 11% for Massachusetts overall.

Across other racial and ethnic categorizations, the percentages are significantly lower.

Figures highlighted in orange are statistically higher compared to the Commonwealth overall, while figures highlighted in blue are significantly lower. Foreign -Born Foreign- born individuals tend to have lower mortality rates and are less likely than native -born populations to incur c ertain chronic/complex conditions (e.g., obesity, circulatory diseases, and some cancers). However, many foreign -born cohorts face significant barriers to care that impede their ability to access health care treatment and support services, social services, and other community resources.7 Boston and Chelsea The percentage of Boston residents who were born outside of the United States was 28% overall, and was significantly higher in several neighborhoods, including Dorchester (Figure 6). Individuals who participated in the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative assessment as key informant interviewees or focus group participants reported that Boston's immigrant community was strong and thriving. Approximately 15% of Boston residents are naturalized United States citizens, of which 5.5% are undocumented. Participants in focus groups and community forums identified that undocumented residents were in need of more outreach and services.8 7 Cunningham, SA, Ruben, JD, Narayan KM.

Many participants in focus groups and key informant interviews reported a desire to see more community engagement highlighting the city 's diversity to further break down barriers. Nearly half of all residents in Chelsea were foreign - born (45%) in 2012- 2016. Figure 7: Foreign (ACS), 2012 -2016 16.0% Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs || Page 34 21.7% 16.2% 14.0% Other BIDMC CBSA Municipalities Among the other municipalities in BIDMC's CBSA, the percentage of the population that is foreign born is significantly higher than the Commonwealth overall, with the exception of Needham, where the percentage is significantly lower. Key informant interviewees from these municipalities felt that foreign - born populations, especially those with limited English proficiency, face significant barriers to care and may struggle to navigate the health system due to language and cultural barriers. Informants also felt that fear and anxiety around immigration status contributed to reluctance of foreign -born populations to seek out health care and social services. Figure 8: American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2013 -2017 Language Language barriers pose significant challenges to providing effective and high -quality community services and health care. While many larger health care institutions, including BIDMC, have medical interpreter services available at their facilities, research has found that the health care providers' cultural competency is key to reducing racial and ethnic health disparities.9 Boston and C helsea Nearly 38% of Boston residents speak a language other than English in their home; among neighborhoods in BIDMC's CBSA, percentages are significantly higher in Dorchester (zip codes 02121 and 02125), Roxbury, and the South End (including Chinatown) compared to Boston overall (Figure 9). According to individuals who participated in focus groups for the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative 9 Denboba DL, Bragdon JL, Epstein LG, Garthright K, McCann Goldman T.

Socioeconomic Characteristics Socioeconomic status (SES), as measured by income, employment status, occupation, education and the extent to which o ne lives in areas of economic disadvantage, is closely linked to morbidity, mortality and overall well- being. Lower than average life expectancy is highly correlated with low income status.11 Education Higher education is associated with improved health ou tcomes and social development at the individual and community levels.12 Compared to individuals with more education, people with less education are more likely to experience health issues such as obesity, substance use, and injury.13 The health benefits of higher education typically include better access to resources, safer and more stable housing, and better engagement with providers. Proximate factors associated with low education that affect health outcomes include the inability to navigate the health ca re system, educational disparities in personal health behaviors, and exposure to chronic stress.14 It is important to note that, while education affects health, poor health status may also be a barrier to education. Boston and Chelsea Nearly half of adults in Boston (48.2%) ages 25 years old or older have a college degree or higher; this is significantly higher compared to the Commonwealth overall. Despite this, there are significant differences in educational attainment by neighborhood and by race/ethnicit y. Approximately 70% of White, non -Hispanic/Latino residents have a college degree, while only approximately 20% of Black/African American, non -Hispanic/Latinos and Hispanic/Latino residents do. Nearly 60% of Asian, non -Hispanic/Latino residents hold a college degree.15 Only 4% of White, non -Hispanic/Latino residents do not have a high school diploma. 26.1% of Hispanic/Latino adult residents do not have a high school diploma. 10 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \"Social Determinants of Health: Know What Affects Health,\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Web Site, https: //ww w.cdc.gov/socialdeterminants/, January 29, 2018. 11 Chetty R, Stepener M, Abraham S, Lin S, Scuderi B, Turner N, Bergeron A, and Cutler D, The association between Income and Life Expectancy in the United States, 2001 -2014,\" Journal of the American Medical Association 315, no. 16 (April 26, 2016): 1750 -1766. 12 Emily B.

As seen in Figure 12, over one -fifth (22%) of residents did not attend high school, and 33% had less than a high school diploma. Look ing at higher levels of attainment, less than 10% of residents had a Master's degree or higher compared to 18% in the Commonwealth overall. 16 Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, School District Profiles 2017 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 39 Figure 12: Educational Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2012- 2016 Other BIDMC CBSA Municipalities The percentage of the population with a high school degree and the percentage with a Bachelor's degree or higher was significantly higher in all municipalities compared to the Commonwealth overall.

Certain populations struggle to find and retain employment for a variety of reasons \u2014ranging from mental and physical health issues, to lack of childcare, to transportation issues and other factors. Boston and Chelsea According to the US Census Bureau, 7.3% of Boston residents were unemployed in 2013 -2017. However, when looking at unemployment data by neighborhood and by race/ethnicity, unemployment rates were significantly higher in several Boston neighborhoods, including Dorchester, Roxbury, and Fenway compared to Boston overall.

Participants shared a number of issues that impeded people's ability to get a job, including educational requirements, mandatory background checks, and issues navigating web -based job applications. While the unemploym ent rate was low in Boston overall, many individuals who responded to the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative assessment reported that were underemployed, wanting higher pay, or desired greater job satisfaction.

Income and Poverty Like education, income affects all aspects of an individual's life, including the ability to secure housing, needed goods (e.g., food, clothing), and services (e.g., transportation, healthcare, childcare). It may also affect one's ability to maintain good healt h. Boston and Chelsea In Boston, the percentage of residents living below the federal poverty level varied greatly by neighborhood and by race/ethnicity. Among Boston neighborhoods, the percentage of residents living below the federal poverty level was hig hest in Fenway (36.7%) and by Dorchester 02125; 28.4%), and the South End (including Chinatown) (24.6%). 17 From Equality and Equity: Advancing the LGBT Community in Massachusetts, A Special Report o f Boston Indicators and the Fenway Institute, 2018 (Page 29).

In focus groups and key informant interviews for the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative assessment, participants discussed the impacts of poverty on health. A large number of Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative assessment respondents reported that they struggled to pay for household costs (e.g., mo rtgages, utility bills, medical bills, credit cards), needed goods (e.g., groceries), and services (e.g., childcare). Non -White respondents and those without a college degree reported these hardships more often than those who were White, non -Hispanic/Latin o and college educated. Among the Chelsea residents who responded to the iCHNA survey, 38% identified poverty as being an important health concern. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median household income was significantly lower in Chelsea ($51,839) compared to the Commonwealth overall ($74,167). Looking across racial/ethnic cohorts in Chelsea, the median household income was lowest among Asian, non - Hispanic/Latino residents ($42,478) and highest amongst those who were multi -racial ($56,149).

While these numbers indicate that very small numbers live in poverty within these municipalities, key informants reported that many individuals struggle - especially older adults living on fixed incomes, and individuals in \"moderate\" income brackets who do not qualify for financial assistance or social service programs. Housing Lack of affordable housing and poor housing conditions contributes to a wide range of health issues, including respiratory diseases, lead poisoning, infectious disease and poor mental health.19 At the extreme are those without housing, including those who are homeless or living in unstable or transient housing situations. They are more likely to delay medical care and have mortality rates four times higher than those who have secure housing.20 Boston and Chelsea In Boston, more than half (52.1%) of renter -occupied units and one -third (35%) of owner- occupied units spent 30% or more of their income on housing costs. In the Fenway neighborhood, 59% of individuals spent at least 30% of their income on housing costs compared to the Boston overall average (52.1%). Similarly, a significantly higher proportion of residents in Fenway (41%) spent at least 30% of their income on housing. Figure 15.

When the survey was administered in 2015, housing was not identified as a top five health concern. In interviews and focus groups for the iCHNA, community health workers (CHWs), many of whom work with foreign -born populations, reported that there are \"slumlords\" in the community - property owners who do not maintain adequate housing conditions. The CHWs relayed that fears around deportation prevented many immigrant residents from reporting the poor housing conditions. Almost half (47%) of households in Chelsea were burdened by household costs compared to 37% for the Commonwealth overall. Percent ages were slightly higher among renter households (49%) compared to owner occupied household (42%).

Transportation Lack of transp ortation has a significant impact on access to health care services and is a determinant of whether an individual or family has the ability to access the basic resources that allow them to live productive and fulfilling lives. Access to affordable and reliable transportation widens opportunity and is essential to addressing poverty and unemployment; it allows access to work, school, healthy foods, recreational facilities and a myriad of other community resources. Boston and Chelsea Nearly 40% of Boston residents use a personal vehicle to commute to work, while 34% utilize public transportation; walking to work (15%) and carpooling (6%) was also reported. These percentages varied by neighborhood: The percentage of residents who utilized transportation to commute to and from work was significantly higher compared to Boston in Roxbury (40%), Dorchester (37 -38%), and Allston/Brighton (35%) In Fenway (28%) and the South End (including Chinatown) (28%), the percentage of residentswho utilized public transporta tion to commute to work was significantly lower compared to Boston overall In focus groups for the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative assessment, residents expressed many concerns around transportation costs, timeliness, and accessibility. These issues were es pecially troublesome for older adults, individuals with limited English proficiency, and for residents of neighborhoods with fewer transportation options. Participants also expressed concerns around parking and traffic. Transportation was identified as a barrier to health care; participants noted that there were several issues with public transportation and transportation programs that impeded one's ability to keep medical appointments, including unreliable schedules, overcrowding, and requirements to schedule in advance.

In all communities except Lexington, the percentage of residents who utilized public transportation to commute to work was significantly high compared to the Commonwealth. The mean commute time was similar to the Commonwealth overall in all communities. With the exception of Lexington, the percentage of residents who worked outside of their county of residence was significantly higher compared to the Commonwealth overall. It is likely that many of the residents of these communities travel to Boston (Suff olk County) for work.

Boston and Chelsea Participants in Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative assessment focus groups and key informant interviews identified food accessibility as a critical concern, especially for particular neighborhoods and segments of the population. Participants reported that individuals in more affluent neighborhoods had better access to healthy foods, while low income neighborhoods and communities o f color had fewer grocery stores, more convenience stores, and more fast food restaurants. Participants identified food assistance programs (e.g., food pantries, mobile markets) as critical community assets. Approximately 17% of Boston adults experience fo od insecurity, though this percentage declined between 2010 and 2017.

The percentage of Chelsea households that received food stamps/SNAP benefits (30. 2%) was double the percentage for Massachusetts overall (12.5%). Other BIDMC CBSA Municipalities Key informants from the municipalities outside of Boston and Chelsea were concerned with food insecurity, especially for frail elders, individuals with chronic /complex conditions, and those without access to transportation. While many communities offered assistance in the form of food pantries or meal delivery (e.g., Meals on Wheels), interviewees were concerned about the nutritional value of the food offered. P articipants reported that it was difficult and/or expensive for individuals to access fresh fruits and vegetables or meals specialized to dietary restrictions (e.g., low -sodium, low -sugar). Crime/Violence Crime and violence, including domestic violence an d intimate partner violence, are public health issues that influence health status on many levels, from death and injury, to emotional trauma, anxiety, isolation and absence of community cohesion. Boston and Chelsea Individuals who participated in the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative assessment reported violence (including domestic violence) and the resulting trauma as major community health concerns, with individuals and communities of color and youth/adolescents disproportionately affected. Approximatel y 25% of Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative assessment respondents described their neighborhood as unsafe or extremely unsafe; Black/African American, non -Hispanic/Latino and Hispanic/Latino Assessment respondents were more likely to respond this way compared to White, non -Hispanic/Latino, Asian, non -Hispanic/Latino, or respondents of other race/ethnicities. Findings also varied by neighborhood: Residents of Allston/Brighton were significantly more likely than the rest of Boston to report experiencing violence in their lifetime (20%) Residents of Fenway were significantly less likely than the rest of Boston to report experiencing violence in their lifetime (8%) Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative assessment respondents from Roxbury (50%) and Dorchester (45%) were mor e likely than residents in other neighborhoods to report feeling unsafe when alone in their street at night as a serious problem Approximately half of Boston CHNA- CHIP Collaborative assessment respondents from Roxbury (50%) and Dorchester (45%) described t heir neighborhood as unsafe or extremely unsafe, a p revalence that was more than double that of all assessment respondents (25%) Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative assessment respondents from Dorchester (36%) were more likely to cite gunshots in their neighborhood over the past year as a serious problem comparedto respondents in other Boston neighborhoodsBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 49 Figure 19: Adults Experiencing Violence in Lifetime by Neighborhood, 2013, 2015, and 2017 Combined US Census Bureau, American Community Survey, 2013-2017.

In focus groups and key informant int erviews, participants expressed that issues of intimate partner violence disproportionately affect women of color and non -English speakers. Exposure to violence in the home and the resulting trauma for youth was particularly concerning. In Chinatown, focus group participants suggested that the community's proximity to homeless shelters contributed to high rates of violence in the community. In Dorchester, key informants and focus group participants were particularly concerned around gun violence and the lon g-term impacts on individuals, families, and the community at -large. Bullying, both in- person and electronic, was a concern for youth, with female and LGBTQ students disproportionately affected. In some communities, issues around family separation and depo rtation were traumatic and contributed to feelings of anxiety and being unsafe. Emergency department visits and deaths due to firearm injuries varied significantly by neighborhood. In Dorchester (02121, 02125, 02122, 02124), Roxbury, and the South End (including Chinatown),rates of nonfatal firearm related emergency department visits were significantly highe r c ompared to Boston overall Among all Boston neighborhoods, the homicide by firearm rate was significantly higher in Dorchester (13.7 and 10.6 hom icides per 100,000 residents) and Roxbury (7.3 homicides per 100,000) compared to Boston overall Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 50 Figure 20: Nonfatal Firearm Related Emergency Department Visit Rate, by Boston and Neighborhood, Age - Adjusted Rate per 100,000 Residents, 2013- 2017 Combined 16.4 NA 4.3 * 40.5 * NA 44.9 * NA 6.0 * 12.0 16.4 * 53.1 * 12.4 41.1 * 6.4 * 19.7 * NA Source: Massachusetts Center for Health Information and Analysis, Acute Hospital Case Mix Databases, 2013 -2017 Combined.

In focus groups and key informant interviews for the iCHNA, Chelsea residents reported that although there were areas in Chelsea that people perceived to be unsafe, they felt safer than they had in the past. Among Chelsea residents wh o responded to the iCHNA survey, 80% responded that they feel safe in their community; among those who reported that they had been treated badly or unfairly, 17% said it was because of their race or ethnicity.

Violent crime counts (e.g., robbery, aggravated assault) were under 50 acro ss all communities. Property crime counts (e.g., burglary, arson, larceny) were also low. Domestic violence, including intimate partner violence, was mentioned in a few key informant interviews and a number of the community meetings Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 51 and focus groups but it was not a dominant theme, typically referenced as part of broader discussion on community violence. Built Environment The built environment\u2014 buildings, streets, parks, open spaces and other forms of physical infrastructure \u2014have major influence s on physical activity and lifestyle. Creating safe outdoor spaces for people to exercise, relax, and commute is an important component in establishing healthy lifestyle habits that protect against poor health outcomes. While concerns related to the built environment were not key themes of this assessment, these issues can work to either prevent or contribute to disease and disability in the community. Boston and Chelsea Over 15% of land in Boston is comprised of green space, including parks, playgrounds, athletic fields, parkways, reservations, and beaches. The City has received a walk score of 81, which designates it as \"very walkable.\" Despite these statistics, participants in focus groups and key informant interviews for the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborati ve assessment expressed concerns about disparities in the built environment across neighborhoods. In Allston/Brighton, Chinatown, and Dorchester, residents reported insufficient green space, attributable to a boon in new housing developments. Participants in Dorchester and Chinatown also expressed concerns around snow removal, lack of public restrooms, and pest control. Across the city, residents were concerned about noise pollution, pollution from vehicles, and traffic; air pollution and air quality was a particular concern raised for residents in Chinatown due to proximity to highways and transportation hubs. Data from the Boston Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BBRFSS) shows Boston residents of colors and those of lower socioeconomic status exp erienced significantly higher rates of secondhand smoke exposure compared to Boston residents overall. Key informant interviewees were also concerned about the impacts of climate change, including extreme heat and rising seas, and the potential impacts on health. Individuals may also be exposed to environmental hazards in their home. In the 2016 Health of Boston Report, it was reported that the Environmental and Occupational Health Division of the Boston Public Health Commission responded to requests for in spections for a number of potential health hazards in private homes, workplaces, and outdoor spaces. From 2012 -2016, over 400 hazards and/or violations were identified due to mold. Most hazards and violations were in Dorchester (02121, 02125, 02122, and 02125) and Roxbury.

Data analysis and image of graph courtesy of the Boston Public Health Commission and Health Resource in Action as part of the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Report In Chelsea, environmental health was the fifth leading health concern amongst residents who took the iCHNA survey. Within this category, trash/litter and outdoor air quality were the most significant concer ns. In Chelsea, a significantly higher percentage of residents are uninsured (7.1%) or have public health coverage (59.3%) compared to the Commonwealth overall (3.0% and 59.3%, respectively). 23 The iCHNA survey asked residents to choose which barriers indi viduals in their community faced when trying to access non -emergency medical care. In Chelsea, overall cost of care was the leading barrier (30%), followed by long wait -times (25%) and insurance (19%). Other BIDMC CBSA Municipalities Concerns around the bu ilt environment and environmental health were not discussed with key informants from other municipalities. There was no identifiable secondary data available at the municipal level to quantify exposure to or impacts of environmental health hazards in these municipalities, so this information was not included. As concerns around the built environment, climate change, and the impact of exposure continue to rise nationwide, there is hope that new sources of data will emerge. 23 U.S. Census Bureau 5 -Year Estimates, 2012 -2016 34 28 26 31 23 24 16 21 9 13 16 11 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 53 Key Findings: Behavioral Risk Factors and Health Status At the core of the CHNA process is understanding access -to-care issues, leading causes of morbidity and mortality, and the extent to which populations and communities participate in certain risky behaviors. This information is critical to assessing health status, clarifying health -related disparities and identifying health priorities. All assessment processes summarized in this report included data collection and analysis from a wide range of local, state, and federal sources. Qualitative information gathered from key informant interviews, focus groups, community meetings and surveys informed this section of the report by providing perspective on the confounding and contributing factors of illness, health priorities, barriers to care, service gaps, and possible strategic responses to the issues identified. This data augmented the quantitative data and allowed for the identification of vulnerable population cohorts. Health Insurance and Access to Care Whether an individual has health insurance \u2014and the extent to which it helps to pay for needed acute services and access to a full continuum of high -quality, timely and accessible preventive and disease management or follow -up services \u2014has been shown to be critical to overall health and well- being.24 Access to a u sual source of primary care is particularly important, since it greatly affects the individual's ability to receive regular preventive, routine, and urgent care, and to manage chronic diseases. Boston and Chelsea The City of Boston is rich in health care resources. Participants in focus groups, key informant interviews, and the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative assessment indicated satisfaction with the health care options (e.g., doctors' offices, community health centers, health clinics) in the community. Data from the BRFSS indicated that approximately 80% of residents identify at least one person as their primary care provider. Among respondents to the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative assessment, nearly three quarters reported having had a dental visit in the last year. Despite overall satisfaction and high rates of utilization, participants did identify several issues that prevent individuals from accessing the care they need, when and where they need it. The most common barriers to access included underinsura nce, language and immigration status, navigation and care coordination, transportation, and lack of culturally sensitive approaches to care.25 Respondents to the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative assessment also identified long wait times and lack of weekend/ evening appointments that impeded access. There were also disparities in access and utilization by race/ethnicity. Asian, non -Hispanic/Latino and Hispanic/Latino residents were significantly less likely to report having one person as their personal doctor or health care provider than White, non - Hispanic/Latino residents 24 National Center for Health Statistics, \"Health Insurance and Access to Care.\" February 2017. Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/factsheets/factsheet_hiac.pdf 25 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Report Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 54 Hispanic/Latino and Black/African American, non -Hispanic/Latino residents were less likely than White, non -Hispanic/Latino or Asian, non -Hispanic/Latino residents to have seen a dentist in the past year Higher percentages of Black/African American, non -Hispanic/Latino and Hispanic/Latino residents reported cost as a barrier to accessing medical and dental care Underinsurance was a commo nly identified barrier to care. Participants indicated that while an individual may be insured, the coverage might not be enough to adequately cover all health care needs. Focus group participants, especially those who are covered under MassHealth, reporte d that there were a limited number of specialty providers who accepted their insurance, or accepted it for the number of appointments needed to effectively treat or manage the condition. Overall, many individuals noted the complexity of the health insurance and the health care system and identified it as a barrier. Findings from BIDMC's CHI, highlighted access to care as a major challenge for large proportions of community residents, particularly for those who are low income, covered by Medicaid, uninsured, recent immigrants, and non -English speakers. This is true for services across the continuum but particularly primary care, medical specialty care, and mental health/substance use services. Participants in two of the five CHI community meetings identified access to care as one of the top three health - related issues. Problems cited were related to shortages of providers, particularly non -English speaking providers, cost of care, and challenges navigating the system. In Chelsea, a significantly high percentage of residents are uninsured (7.1%) or have public insurance coverage (59.3%) compared to the Commonwealth overall (3.0% and 35.5%, respectively). 26 The iCHNA survey asked residents to choose which barriers individuals in their community faced when trying to access non -emergency medical care. In Chelsea, overall cost of care was the leading barrier (30%), followed by long wait -times (25%) and insurance (19%). Other BIDMC CBSA Municipalities In the other municipalities in BIDMC's CBSA, the percentage of res idents without health insurance or with public health coverage (e.g., MassHealth/Medicaid, Medicare) was significantly lower compared to the Commonwealth overall. As in Boston and Chelsea, key informant interviewees discussed the complexity of the health i nsurance and health care system as a barrier to care, especially for older adults without dedicated caregivers and individuals with limited English proficiency. Underinsurance, especially for moderate -income individuals and families who do not qualify for public health coverage programs, was also a critical barrier to care. Interviewees reported that even for those with private insurance, some health care services, namely mental health and substance use treatment and support services, was unaffordable.

Figures highlighted in orange are statistically higher compared to the Commonwealth overall, while figures highlighted in blue are significantly lower. Physical Activity, Nutrition, and Weight Lack of physical fitness and poor nutrition are among the leading risk factors associated w ith obesity and chronic health issues. Adequate nutrition helps prevent disease and is essential for the healthy growth and development of children and adolescents, while overall fitness and the extent to which people are physically active reduce the risk for many chronic conditions and are linked to better emotional health. Over the past two decades, obesity rates in the United States have doubled for adults and tripled for children. Overall, these trends have spanned all segments of the population, regardless of age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, income, or geographic region. Boston and Chelsea More than 50% of Boston adults and over one -third of students in Boston Public Schools were overweight or obese. Participants in the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative assessment key informant interviews and focus groups discussed concerns around obesity and its health effects. Looking at the data from the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative there were significant disparities by neighborhood, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation/gender identity, and socioeconomic status. The percentage of adults who are obese or overweight was significantly higher in Dorcheste r (6 3-65%) compared to Boston overall (56.8%) Black/African American, non- Hispanic/Latino and Hispanic/Latino adults were more likely to b e o verweight or obese compared to White, non -Hispanic/Latino residents Significantly higher percentages of Black/African American, non -Hispanic/Latino (36%) and Hispanic/Latino (37%) high school students reported being obese or overweight than White, non-Hispanic/Latino high school students (23%) A significantly higher percentage of LGBTQ youth (38%) reported being obese or overweight compared to heterosexual or non -transgender youth (32%) - these trends are also seen nationally Individuals with lower educational attainment and lower income were more likely to be obese or overweight compared to other segments of the population Figure 22: Percent Adults Reporting Obesity or Overweight, by Boston and Neighborhood, 2013, 2015, and 2017 Combined Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 56 Source: Boston Public Health Commission, Boston Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2013, 2015, and 2017 combined.

This affects residents' ability to access fresh, nutritious foods that contribute to good health. Residents also discu ssed limited access to green space and exposure to environmental hazards, as discussed in the previous section on the built environment; these factors limit individuals' ability to exercise and be physically active. In Chelsea, the percentages of public sc hool students who were overweight or obese were higher than the Commonwealth overall across several grades. Participants in the iCHNA focus groups reported that more green and outdoor space were needed in all communities. Participants, especially youth participants, also reported a need for more activities to promote active lifestyles and interaction with others in the community.

Questions regarding being obese or overweight, consumption of fruits and vegetables, and physical activity/sedentary lifestyle are asked as part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey, though this survey data is only available for the nation, state, and major metropolitan/micropolitan areas. * * * 37.0% 50.4% * * 57.9% 57.3% 50.7% Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 57 Key informant interviewees were concerned about poor nutrition and sedentary lifestyle, especially as risk factors to chronic and complex conditions (e.g., heart disease, cancer). As concerns around social isolation and technology addictions continue to grow, so do the potential impacts on health. Many recent observational studies point to relationships between screen media exposure and increased risks of obesity. 27 All-Cause Mortality and Premature Mortality All-cause mortality rates refer to death from any cause. These rates are important to understand as they may uncover patterns by geography or region. Premature (or early) mortality rates are often due to behavioral factors that are preventable or modifiable (e.g., substance use, physical inactivity, poor nutrition) and may be useful for identifying opportunities for new health programs or strategies. Boston and Chelsea Cancer and heart disease were the leading causes of death in Boston. Accidents, including unintentional overdoses, was the third leading cause of death. Accidents were also the leading cause of premature death among individuals under the age of 65. Contributing factors varied by race/ethnicity: Among White, no n-Hispanic/Latino and Hispanic/Latino residents, unintentional opioid overdoses accounted for over of accidental deaths Among Black/African American, non- Hispanic/Latino and Hispanic/Latino residents, homicide was one of the top five leading causes of premature death Among White, non -Hispanic/Latino and Asian, non -Hispanic/Latino residents, suicide was in the top five leading causes of premature death Compared to the Commonwealth overall, mortality rates and premature mortality rates (<75 years) were significantly higher in both Boston and Chelsea.

Screen media exposure and obesity in children and adolescents. Pediatrics, November 2017; 40(2). Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 58 Chronic and Complex Conditions Chronic conditions such as heart disease, canc er, stroke, asthma, and diabetes are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and are the leading drivers of the nation's $3.3 trillion annual healthcare costs.28 Over half of American adults have at least one chronic condition, while 40% have two or more.29 Perhaps most significantly, chronic diseases are largely preventable despite their high prevalence and dramatic impact on individuals and society. This underscores the need to focus on health risk factors, primary care engagement and evidence -based chronic disease management. Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Diseases Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, such as heart disease and stroke, are affected by a number of health and behavioral risk factors, including obesity and physical inactivity, tobacco use, and alcohol use. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, increases the risk of more serious health issues including heart failure, stroke and other forms of major cardiovascular disease. Racial disparities in heart disease and hypertension are well documented; Black/African American, non -Hispanic/Latinos are two to three times as likely as White, non -Hispanics/Latinos to die of preventable heart disease and stroke.30 The age of onset for stroke is earlier for African Americans and Hispanic/Latinos compared to White, non - Hispanic/Latino.31 Boston and Chelsea Among participants in the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative assessment, neither heart disease nor stroke was identified as a key theme, though some acknowledged that there was high prevalence among older adults, and increasingly high incidence of heart disease in younger cohorts. Looking at quantitative data, there was significant disparities in reported prevalence across specific conditions and neighborhoods. A significantly higher percentage of residents in Roxbury (30%) and Dorchester (30%) reported having been diagnosed with hypertension compared to Boston overall (25%) Heart disease hospitalization rates were significantly higher in Roxbury (79.5 per 100,000), Dorchester (114.0 and 116.8 per 100,000), and the South End (including Chinatown) (106.5 per 100,000) compared to Boston overall (97.6 per 100,000 residents) The heart disease mortality rate was significantly higher in Roxbury (158.8 per 100,000) and significantly lo wer in Fenway (96.5 per 100,00) and the South End (including Chinatown) (101.4 per 100,000) compared to Boston overall (131.4 per 100,000) 28 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \"Chronic Diseases in America,\" US Census Bureau, 2013 -2017 ACS 5 -Year Estimates, last updated April 15, 2019. 29 CDC, Chronic Diseases in America 30 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5638710/ 31 https://www.stroke.org/understand -stroke/impact- of-stroke/minorities -and-stroke/ Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 59 Figure 23: Heart Disease Mortality Rate in Boston, by Neighbor hood, Age -Adjusted Rate per 100,000 Residents, 157.3 * 101.4 133.4 * Source: Boston Public Health Commission, Boston resident deaths, 2016 -2017 Combined.

Figure 24: Heart Disease and Cerebrovascular Disease Mortality Rates, Age -adjusted Rates per 100,000, Source : Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Registry of Vital Records and Statistics, 2015 Cancer The most common cancer risk factors are well known: age, family history of cancer, alcohol and tobacco use, diet, exposure to cancer causing substances, chronic inflammation, and hormones. Boston and Chelsea Despite being the leading cause of death among Boston residents, cancer was not identified as a key concern among Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative assessment interviewees or focus group participants, with the exception of Chinatown. In Chinatown, participants discussed how high rates of tobac co use in the neighborhood contribute to cancer rates. There were significant disparities in cancer mortality rates by race/ethnicity among Boston residents. The female breast cancer mortality rate was significantly lower among Asian, non - Hispanic/Latino residents (9.9 per 100,000) compared to Boston overall (19.9 per 100,000) Among Black/African American, non -Hispanic/Latino residents, the lung cancer mortality rate (32.4 per 100,000) was significantly lower and the prostate cancer mortality rate (49.8 pe r 100,000) was significantly higher compared to Boston overall (12.1 and 24.5 per 100,000 respectively) Among Hispanic/Latino residents, mortality rates for colorectal cancer (6.4 per 100,000), lung cancer (18.4 per 100,000) and female breast cancer (8.2 per 100,000) were significantly lower compared to Boston overall Cerebrovascular Disease Heart Disease Newton Needha m Lexington Brookline Massachusetts 0 10.7 18.2 13.2 20 22.9 28.4 80 60 40 82.8 100 109.8 104.5 112.8 140 120 138.7 160 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 61 S OURCE: Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Boston resident deaths, 2015 -2017 Combined.

Respiratory diseases are the third leading cause of death in the United States. In many scenarios, quality of life for those with respiratory diseases can improve with proper care and management. 34 Boston and Chelsea In Boston, prevalence, ED discharges, and hospitalization rates due to asthma varied significantly by neighborhood. In Roxbury (15%) and Dorchester (15%), a significantly higher percentage of residents reported diagnoses asthma compared to Boston overall (11.2%) The asthma emergency discharge rate was significantly higher in Roxbury (205.1 per 10,000),Dorchester (160.4 and 167.2 per 10,000), and the South End (including Chinatown) (132.5 per 34 Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, \"Respiratory Diseases,\" Retrieved from https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics -objectives/topic/respiratory- diseases 180 160 152. 8 140 136.5 137.2 120 100.7 101.9 100 80 60 40 37.3 28.6 20.2 8.4 23.1 20 9.8 12 5.8 10.3 9.7 3.6 1.913.9 15.3 0 0 1 0 Massachusetts Brookline Lexington Needham Newton All-Cause Breast (female, invasive) Colorectal Lung Prostate 1 1 1 7 2 39 1 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 63 10,000) compared to Boston overall (101.0 per 10,000).

Other BIDMC CBSA Municipalities The diabetes mortality rate amongst the other municipalities in BIDMC's CBSA was lower or significantly lower compared to the Commonwealth overall. While diabetes was not a key concern among key informants, many did discuss the importance of addressing risk factors that contribute to some forms of the disease (e.g., physical inactivity, poor nutrition, obesity). Mental Health Mental health \u2014including depression, anxiety, stress, serious mental illness and other conditions \u2014was overwhelmingly identified as one of the leading health issue for residents of BIDMC's CBSA. Boston and Chelsea Mental health was identified as a priority health issue in the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative assessment; it was discussed in nearly all focus groups and interviews. Stress, anxiety, depression were specifically identified as issues and conditions of concern. Many participants discussed the interrelatedness of these and other mental health issues with trauma and poverty. Overall, approximately one in five Boston adults reported that they felt persistent anxiety, and one in eight reported that they felt persistent sadness. While mental health affects all segments of the population, disparities in prevalence and intensity of issues were identified for specific neighborhoods, age groups, racial/ethnic segments, socioeconomic cohorts, and other groups. A prominent theme in focus groups and key informant interviews was concern for mental health issues amongs t youth and adolescents. A higher percentage of females, Hispanic/Latinos, lower income individuals, young people, LGBTQ, and unemployed residents reported feeling persistent anxiety compared to other groups The rate of Boston Public High School students r eporting persistent sadness is higher among those who identify as Hispanic/Latino, Black/African American, non -Hispanic/Latino, female, and LGBTQ The suicide rate in Dorchester (02122, 02124) was significantly higher compared to Boston overall Age-adjusted suicide rates were highest amongst White, non -Hispanic/Latino residents, men, and individuals ages 45-64 Beyond concerns around the prevalence of specific conditions, there was also discussion around barriers to mental health treatment and support services. Although data shows that the percentage of individuals who received treatment for depression has increased, participants reported that many residents experience barriers to care due to stigma, lack of providers, and cultural/linguistic norms. 38 Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Registry of Vital Records and Statistics; age -adjusted rates per 100,000 (2015) 39 Center for Health Information and Analysis; age -adjusted rates per 100,000 (2007 -2014) Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 67 Mental health was also a primary concern in Chelsea; it was consistently mentioned across all iCHNA focus groups, especially for youth and adolescents. In Chelsea: 28% of middle school students and 38% of high school students reported feeling sad or hopeless for more than two week s in a row. Both data points are higher than percentages for Massachusetts overall 20% of middle school students and 13% of high school students reported having seriously considered suicide. Both data points are higher than percentages in Massachusetts overall Figure 31: Middle School and High School Students Reporting Feeling Sad/Hopeless for 2+ Weeks Other BIDMC CBSA Municipalities The rate of mental health disorder mortality and suicide deaths were lower or significantly lower among other municipalities in BIDMC's CBSA. However, mental health issues were identified as key community health concerns across all key informant interviews. Participants identified mental health as an issue across all segments of the population, but were particularly concerned about depression, anxiety, and stress amongst youth and social isolation amongst older Sad Hopeless 2+ Weeks (High School) Massachusetts Chelsea Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 68 Figure 32: Mental Disorder and Suicide Mortality, Age-adjusted rates per 100,000, 2015 Source: Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Registry of Vital Records and Statistics, 2015 The Massachusetts Healthy Aging Collaborative released a series of Healthy Aging C ommunity Profiles in 2018. These documents include a range of data points pertaining to health behaviors, social determinants, and the physical and mental health status of older adults. Looking across the communities in BIDMC's CBSA that are outside of Bos ton and Chelsea: The percentage of adults 60+ with reported 15 or more days of poor mental health within the last month was lower in all municipalities compared to the Commonwealth overall The percentage of adults 65+ with depression was significantly high in Brookline (35.2%) and significantly low in Needham (29.5%) compared to the Commonwealth overall (31.5%) The percentage of adults 65+ with anxiety was significantly low in all Brookline, Lexington, Needham, and Newton compared to the Commonwealth overall Figure 33: Mental Health among Older Adults, 2018 Adults >60 with 15+ days poor mental health in last month Adults 65+ with depression Adults 65+ with anxiety Collaborative, Healthy Aging Community Profiles, 2018 Shading represents statistical significance compared to the Commonwealth.

As with mental health services, there are a number of community partners working to fill service gaps and address the needs of both individuals and the at -large community, although some individuals may face delays or barriers to care due to limited providers and specialists, limited treatment beds and social determinants that impede access (e.g., insurance coverage, transportation, employment, linguistic capacity, health literacy). Boston and Chelsea Participants in activities for the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative assessment identified substance use as a priority health issue; marijuana, prescription drugs, and opioids were the most concerning substances identified. The impacts of the opioid epidemic on individuals, families, and communities was a key theme of focus groups and interviews. Focus group participants in the South End (Chinatown) and Roxbury spoke about the health and safety hazards of drug paraphernalia on the streets, especially for youth and adolescents. As seen throughout the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative assessment results, there were disparities in prevalence of use and health outcomes by population groups: LGBTQ adults and youth are more likely to use tobacco, e- cigarettes, marijuana, alcohol, and prescription drugs compared to heterosexual and non -transgender adults and youth The rate of opioid overdose deaths has increased significantly since 2013, and was highest amongst Hispanic/Latino and White, non- Hispanic/Latino residents The percentage of residents who currently smok e was significantly higher in the South End (including Chinatown) (22.2%) and Dorchester (21.9%) compared to Boston overall (16.5%) Figure 34: Percent Adults Reporting Current Smoking, by Boston and Neighborhood, 2013, 2015, and Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 70 So urce: Boston Public Health Commission, Boston Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2013, 2015, and 2017 combined.

Some individuals reported that the overprescribing and diagnoses of mental and behavioral health issues (e.g., ADHD) enabled addictive behaviors among youth by contributing to overmedication. Participants also suggested that behavioral health issues might stem from undiagnosed mental health issues and trauma. One focus group participant noted that there has been a significant increase in ADHD diagnoses among Black/African American, non- Hispanic/Latino and Hispanic/Latino youth. In Chelsea, substance use, including opioids, alcohol use, marijuana, and tobacco/e -cigarettes, was also a critical area of concern. According to treatment statistics from the Massachusetts Bureau of Substance Abuse Services (BSAS), the percentage of individuals from Chelsea who were admitted for the treatment of drug and alcohol use increased between 2008 and 2018, from 29 to 32%. Among respondents in the iCHNA survey, 12% reported that they have needed substance use services, but were unable to access them. Other BIDMC CBSA Municipalities Key informants identified substance use, including opioids, alcohol use, and e -cigarettes/vaping as a priority issue in BIDMC's CBSA. Amo ngst those who worked with youth/adolescents, the use of e- cigarettes and vaping devices was characterized as an epidemic, with use starting at the middle school grade level. While opioids continue to remain a critical concern, many key informants felt th at there were many strong community -level interventions in place to promote education, outreach, and access to treatment.

Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI's), diseases transmitted through drug use, vector -borne illnesses, tuberculosis, pneumonia and influenza are among the infectious diseases that have the greatest impact on modern American populations. Young children, older adults, individuals with compromised immune systems, injection drug users and those having unprotected sex are most at risk for contracting infectious diseases. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 71 Boston and Chelsea Infectious disease and sexual health were not identified as priority community health issues in focus groups or key informant interviews for the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative assessment . While not discussed, quantitative data indicates that there are significantly higher rates of sexually transmitted infections in Boston, with disparities by race/ethnicity, age, and neighborhood. The chlamydia incidence rate in Dorchester (1310 cases per 100,000) was 1.5 times the rate in Boston overall. Rates were also high in Roxbury (1070.5 per 100,000) and Dorchester (1068.5 per 10,000). The incidence rate is significantly higher in young adults aged 15 -24 (1737.8 cases per 100,000) compared to those 40 years and over (161.2 cases per 100,000) Females have a significantly high rate of chlamydia (833.3 cases per 100,000) compared to males (721.3 cases per 100,000) Gonorrhea incidence rates were significantly higher in the South End, Dorchester, and Roxb ury compared to Boston overall. Younger residents experienced high rates of gonorrhea.

A full Implementation Strategy (IS), with goals, priority populations, objectives, strategies, metrics, and partners, may be found in Appendix F. Core Implementation Strategy (IS) Planning Principles and State Priorities In developing the IS, care was taken to ensure that BIDM C's community health priorities were aligned with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts priorities set by MDPH and the MA AGO (Table 21). Care was also taken to ensure that the IS was aligned with broader principals drawn from the Commonwealth's Community Bene fits Guidelines and the literature on how to best promote community health improvement and prevention efforts. Table 21: Massachusetts Community Health Priorities Community Benefits Priorities Determination of Need Priorities Housing stability and homelessness Built environments Mental illness and mental health Social environments Substance Use Disorders Chronic disease, with a focus on cancer, heart disease, and diabetesHousing Violence Education Employment Priority Populations BIDMC is committed to improving the health status and well- being of all residents living throughout its CBSA. Certainly all geographic, demographic, and socioeconomic segments of the population face challenges of some kind that can hinder their ability to access care or maintain good health. Regardless of age, race/ethnicity, income, family history, or other characteristics, everyone is impacted in some way by health- related risks. With this in mind, BIDMC's IS includes activities that will support resident s throughout its CBSA, across all segments of the population. In recognition of the considerable health disparities that exist in some communities, BIDMC focuses the bulk of its Community Benefits resources on improving the health status of low income and underserved populations living in the city of Chelsea and the Boston neighborhoods of Allston/Brighton, Bowdoin/Geneva, Chinatown, Fenway/Kenmore, and Roxbury/Mission Hill. While there are certainly segmentsof the populations in Brookline, Chestnut Hill, Lexington, and Needham that are vulnerable and underserved, the greatest disparities exist in Chelsea and Boston. In order to maximize the impact of its Community Benefits resources, BIDMC's Community Benefit Committee (CBC) voted to prioritize and focus BIDMC's attentionon themore urban, high- need communities in BIDMC's CBSA. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 74 Based on the findings from the breadth of BIDMC's assessment activities, further efforts were made to prioritize certain population segments by race/ethnicity, socio -econ omic status, and other factors. More specifically, the CBC and the CBSLT voted to prioritize youth and adolescents, older adults, low -resource individuals and families, LGBTQ populations, racially/ethnically diverse populations, and limited -English speaker s. Figure 38: BIDMC Priority Populations 2020- 2022 Following is a summary of the factors that led BIDMC's CBC and CBSLT to prioritize these population segments. Youth and Adolescents Youth and adolescents were identified as among the most vulnerable and at -risk populations in the CBSA. Participants' reasons for believing this group sh ould be prioritized varied, but centered on the impacts of mental health and substance use. Adolescence is a critical transitional period that includes biological and developmental milestones that are important to establishing long -term identity and indepe ndence but can lead to conflict, isolation and tension between adolescents and parents or caregivers. During this time, young people may struggle to access health education and information, social services, or may be seen by providers that misunderstand th e needs of those in this age group. Although adolescents are generally healthy, many do struggle with health and social issues, such as obesity (e.g., poor nutrition and lack of physical activity), mental health (e.g., depression, anxiety, stress), substan ce use (e.g., cigarettes/vaping, marijuana, alcohol, opiates), sexually transmitted infectious, and injuries due to accidents. Older Adults Chronic disease, social isolation/lack of family support, living on fixed incomes, affordable housing, and transpor tation were identified as significant issues for the older adult population. In the U.S. and the Commonwealth, older adults are among the fastest growing age groups. Youth and Adolescents Older Adults Low Resource Individuals and Families LGBTQ Racially and Ethnically Diverse Populations/non- English speakers Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 75 Chronic/complex conditions are the leading cause of death among older adults, and older adults are more likely to develop chronic illnesses such as hypertension, diabetes, COPD, congestive heart failure, depression, anxiety, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and dementia than younger adult cohorts. By 2030, the CDC and the Healthy People 2020 Initiative estimate that 37 million people nationwide, 60% of the older adult population ages 65 years and over will need to manage more than one chronic medical condition. Significant proportions of this group experience hospitalizations, are admitted to nursing homes, receive home health services, and/or require health and social supports in community - based settings. Addressing these concerns demands a health and social service system that is robust, diverse, and responsive. Low Resource Individuals and Families Key informants, focus group participants, and BIDMC leadership discussed the challenges that individuals and families face when they are forced to decide between housing, health care, transportation, childcare, food, and other essentials. These choices often lead to missed care or delays in care, due to either the direct costs of care (co -pays and deductibles) or the indirect costs of transportation, childcare, or missed wages. There was near consensus that lack of affordable and high - quality housing was a leading issue in BIDMC's CBSA. Participants also spoke of the intense challenges that many moderate -income individuals and families face due to the high cost of living, combined with the fact that most of those in the middle- income group are not eligible for public programs like Medicaid, food stamps, Healthy Start, and other subsidized services. LGBTQ Massachusetts has the second largest LGBTQ population of state in the nation (5%). While societal acceptance of the LGBTQ community has increased greatly over the past few decades, this population still faces discrimination and health disparities. The LGBTQ community continues to face issues of disproportionate violence and discrimination, socioeconomic inequality, and health disparities. The LGBTQ population is a large and diverse population, though there is a tendency to view LGBTQ as a monolithic identity, some experience greater disparities than others do. In Massachusetts, transgender residents experience higher rates of poverty, unemployment, and homelessness compared to those who are not transgender. 40 The Human Rights Campaign Foundation continues to recognize BIDMC as a \"Leader in LGBTQ Healthcare Equality\" - meaning the institution consistently demonstrates its deep commitment to LGBTQ patients and families. BIDMC is committed to providing equitable care for all and will continue to uphold non -discrimination policies for LGBTQ patients and employees, equal visitation for same -sex partners and parents, and LGBTQ health education for staff members. Racially and Ethnically Diverse Populations and Limited -English Speakers As referenced throughout this report, there are significant disparities in health care access, health outcomes, and barriers to care by race, ethnicity, place of origin, and language ability. These disparities 40 Equality and Equity Report Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 76 are especially prevalent in Boston and Chelsea where there is a greater percentage of non -White residents, foreign -born individuals, and non -English spe akers. These disparities create and contribute to generational patterns of inequity and injustice. BIDMC is committed to working to address these inequities. BIDMC commits to continuing to engage, collaborate, and empower individuals in these communities and to break down the barriers that impede people from accessing high quality and affordable healthcare. Community Health Priority Areas BIDMC's Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative assessment is a population -based assessment. The goal was to engage the community and compile quantitative and qualitative information to identify the leading health -related issues affecting individuals in the CBSA, including social determinants of health, service gaps, and barriers to care. The priorities that have been identified hav e been framed broadly to ensure that the full breadth of unmet needs and community health issues are recognized. These priorities were identified through an integrated and thorough review of all of the quantitative and qualitative information captured acro ss all of the components of BIDMC's CHNA. The priorities have been identified to maximize impact, reduce disparities, and promote collaboration and cross -sector partnership. During the later stages of the CHNA process, significant efforts were made to vet the priority issues with leadership and the community -at large, through meetings with the CBC and the CBSLT. BIDMC is confident that these priorities reflect the sentiments of those who were involved in the assessment and community engagement processes. Ba sed on the findings from the breadth of BIDMC's CHNA activities, the CBC and the CBSLT voted to prioritize 1) Social determinants of health, 2) Chronic/complex conditions and their risk factors, 3) Access to care, and 4) Mental health and substance use. F igure 39: BIDMC Priority Areas 2020- 2022 T he community health priorities that have been prioritized by the CHNA in Figure 37 above are described in detail in the next section of this report, along with a listing of the goals related to these priority areas that BIDMC's Community Benefits staff, the CBC, and CBSLT believe will drive achievement. The obje ctives and strategic initiatives, by priority area, that will be part of BIDMC's Implementation Strategy are included in BIDMC's Summary Implementation Strategy, included in Appendix F Community Health Needs not Prioritized by BIDMC's CBC Social Determinants of Health Chronic/Complex Conditions and Risk Factors Access to Care Behavioral Health (Mental Health and Substance Use) Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 77 It is important to note that there are community health needs that were identified by BIDMC's assessment that, due to the limited burden that these issues present and/or the feasibility of having an impact in the short - or long -term on these issues, were not prioritized for investment. Namely, transportation and education were identified as community needs but these issues were deemed by the CBC and the CBSLT to be outside of BIDMC's primary sphere of influence and have opted to allow others in its CBSA, the Greater Boston region, and the Commonwealth to focus on these issues. This is not to say that BIDMC will not support efforts in these areas. BIDMC remains open and willing to work with hospitals across Beth Israel Lahey Health's network, with COBTH, and other public and private partners to address these issues, particularly as part of a broad, strong collaborative. BIDMC Implementation Strategy & Community Benefits Resources BIDMC's current 2017- 2019 Implementation Strategy was developed in 2016 and addresse s all of the priority areas identified by this CHNA. Certainly, this CHNA has provided new guidance and invaluable insight on the characteristics of the population, social determinants of health, barriers to care, and leading health issues that has informe d and allowed BIDMC to update its current Implementation Strategy. Included below, organized by priority area are the core elements of BIDMC 2020 - 2022 Implementation Strategy. The content of the strategy is designed to address the underlying social deter minants of health, barriers to care, and promote health equity. The content is also designed to address the leading community health priorities, including activities geared to health education and wellness (primary prevention), identification, screening, and referral (secondary prevention), and disease management and treatment (tertiary prevention - including access to care, self- management support, harm reduction, treatment of acute illness, and recovery). Below is a brief discussion of the resources that BIDMC will invest to address the priorities identified by the CBC and CBSLT. Following the discussion of resources are summaries of each of the selected priority areas and a listing of the goals that have been established for each priority area. Community Benefits Resources BIDMC expen ds substantial resources on its community benefits program to drive achievement on the goals and objectives in its current Implementation Strategy. These resources are expended, according to its current IS, through direct and in-kind investments in programs or services operated by BIDMC or its partners to improve the health of those living in its CBSA. Additionally, BIDMC works on its own or with its partners to leverage funds through public or private grants and other funding sources. Finally, BIDMC supports residents in its CBSA by providing \"charity\" care to low income individuals who are deemed unable to pay for care and services provided at its service sites. Moving forward, BIDMC will commit resources in amounts comparable to if not more than what has historically been expended through the same array of direct, in -kind, leveraged, or \"charity\" care expenditures. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 78 BIDMC and its leadership is committed to community benefits budget planning which ensures the fun ds and resources available to carry out its community benefits mission and to implement activities to address the needs identified by this CHNA. Recognizing that community benefits planning is ongoing and will change with continued community input, BIDMC's Implementation Strategy will evolve. Circumstances may change with new opportunities, requests from the community, community and public health emergencies, and other issues may arise, which may require a change in the IS or the strategies documented withi n it. The CBC, the CBSLT, and BIDMC's Board of Trustees are committed to assessing information and updating the plan as needed. Following are brief descriptions of each priority area, along with the goals that were established by BIDMC to respond to the CH NA findings and the planning process. Please refer to the Implementation Strategy (IS) for more details. PRIORITY AREA 1: SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH According to the World Health Organization, the social determinants of health are the conditions in whic h people are born, grow, live, work and age. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources at global, national and local levels. The social determinants of health are mostly responsible for health inequities - the unfair and avoidable differences in health status seen within and between countries.41 Quantitative and qualitative data from all aspects of BIDMC's CBSA CHNA showed clear geographic and demographic disparities related to the leading social determinants of health (e.g., economic stability, housing, transportation, violence, food access, education, and community cohesion). These issues influence and define quality of life for many segments of the population in BIDMC's CBSA. Housing, poverty, transportation, violence, and food access were identified as having a particularly substantial impact on residents in living in Boston and Chelsea. Figure 40: PRIORITY AREA 1: SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH Priority Area 1: Social Determinants of Health Goal 1: Promote Healthy Neighborhoods (Healthy Eating, Active Living, Other Healthy Behaviors, Health -related Programs/Policies) Goal 2: Promote Violence Prevention (Safe Neighborhoods and Community Cohesion) Goal 3: Promote Affordable Housing Goal 4: Promote Home Ownership Goal 5: Support Workforce Development and Creation of Employment Opportunities Goal 6: Promote Environmental Sustainability PRIORITY AREA 2: CHRONIC / COMPLEX CONDITIONS & THEIR RISK FACTORS Based on a review of the quantitative data compiles for this assessment, heart disease, stroke and cancer are by far the leading causes of death in the nation, the Commonwealth, and in BIDMC's CBSA. Roughly 7 in 10 deaths can be attributed to these three conditions. If you include respiratory disease (e.g., asthma, Congestive heart failure, and COPD) and diabetes, which are in the top 10 leading causes across nearly all geographies than one can account for the vast majority of causes of death. All of these 41 https://www.who.int/social_determinants/sdh_definition/en/ (Accessed on August 9, 2019) Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 79 conditions are generally considered to be chronic and complex and can strike early in one's life, quite often ending in premature death. In this category, heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension were thought to be of the highest priority, although cancer was also discussed frequently in the focus groups and forums. There are also a number of communities within the CBSA that have higher rates of certain types of cancer than the Commonwealth overall. It is also important to note that the risk and protective factors for nearly all chronic/complex conditions are the same, including tobacco use, lack of physical activity, poor nutrition, obesity, and alcohol use. Although treating these illnesses requires a range of clinical interventions, there is a great deal of overlap with respect to the potential community interventions. Population -level responses to chronic and complex conditions all require community based education, screening, self -management support, timely access to treatment, and seamless coordination of follow -up services. Figure 41: PRIORITY AREA 2: CHRONIC/COMPLEX CONDITIONS AND THEIR RISK FACTORS Priority Area 2: Chronic/Complex Conditions and their Risk Factors Goal 1: Improve Chronic Disease Management Goal 2: Reduce cancer disparities (access to screening and treatment) Goal 3: Support Older Adults to Age in Place PRIORITY AREA 3: ACCESS TO CARE The Greater Boston Area, including BIDMC's CBSA, has one of the strongest and most comprehensive healthcare systems in the world. This system is expansive and spans the full healthcare continuum, including outreach and screening services, primary care medical, and medical specialty care services. There are no absolute gaps in services across the continuum, even for low income and racially/ethnically diverse populations that often struggle with access to health care services. This does not mean, however, that everyone in BIDMC's CBSA receives the highest quality services when they want it and where they want it. In fact, despite the overall success of the Commonwealth's heath reform efforts, data captured for this assessment shows that segments of the population, particularly low income, racially/ethnically diverse populations, and those with limited or no English language skills face significant barriers to care. These segments as well as others struggle to access services or navigate the health system due to lack of insurance, cost, transportation, cultural/linguistic barriers, the general complexity of the system, and shortages of providers willing to serve Medicaid or low income, uninsured patients. Figure 42: PRIORITY A REA 3: ACCESS TO CARE Priority Area 3: Access to Care Goal 1: Increase Access to Quality Medical Services, Including Primary Care, OB/GYN, and Specialty Care, as well as Urgent, Emergent and Trauma Care Goal 2: Increase Access to Quality Oral Health Serv ices Goal 3: Promote Equitable Care and Support for those who face cultural and linguistic barriers Goal 4: Promote Greater Health Equity and Reduce Disparities in Access for LGBTQ Populations Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 80 PRIORITY AREA 4: MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE There is a growing appreciation for the impact that mental health and substance use are having on individuals, families, and communities. These issues impact all segments of the population across BIDMC's CBSA and across all demographic segments. With respect to mental health, a review of the quantitative and qualitative data highlights the impact of depression, anxiety, and stress as well as bipolar disorder and other serious mental illnesses. Stigma and the impacts of racism and discrimination have also been shown to play a substantial role with respect to mental illness and access to preventive, treatment, and recovery services. With respect to substance use, the data highlights the impact of alcohol, opioids, and marijuana. The prevalence, incidence, and service utilization rates (inpatient hospitalization, emergency department visits, and public program utilization) are higher in a number of communities in BIDMC's CBSA when compared to benchmark data. Large proportions of the population are substantially impacted by mild to moderate mental health and substance use issues such as mild/moderate depression, anxiety and acute stress or alcohol and marijuana misuse, while smaller segments struggle acutely with severe mental illnesses or opioid addiction and alcoholism. Trauma is also a major factor with respect to mental health and substance use. Many of those who have experience trauma suffer acutely from formally diagnosed post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), while others either have milder, less substantial impacts, or have undiagnosed PTSD. Substance use or misuse is often a byproduct of mental illness. Isolation and depression in older adult segments was brought up in nearly every discussion that touched on elder health. Finally, there is a dramatic gap in capacity when it comes to mental health and substance use services, particularly for those who are non -English speakers, low income, covered by Medicaid, uninsured, or underinsured. Even those who are insured and have comprehensive benefits can find i t challenging to find professionals willing to take their insurance. As a result, people often go without needed care due to linguistic access, cost, and/or provider shortages. Figure 43: PRIORITY AREA 4: BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ( Mental Health Care and Substance Use) Priority Area 4: Mental Health and Substance Use Goal 1: Increase Access to Quality Mental Health Care and Substance Use Services Goal 2: Reduce burden of opioid use Goal 3: Promote Behavioral Health Workforce Development and Increase Capacity Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center: Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 || Page 81 Appendices Inventory Appendix E: Contact Information for BIDMC's Community Director Appendix F: BIDMC Summary Implementation APPENDIX A : Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment Detailed Approach and Methods Overview As discussed in the body of this report, it would be difficult to overstate BIDMC's commitment to a robust, collaborative, inclusive, transparent, and objective assessment and community engagement process. BIDMC's Community Benefits staff dedicated countless hours of their time and other resources , over nearly a year , to conduct this Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). Rather than conducting one -single assessment, BIDMC's community benefit staff conducted their own assessment and participated in a series of additional, concurrent , comprehensive assessments that were then aggregated together to create this CHNA Report . These concurrent assessments were conducted by organizations or collectives of organizations , with whom BIDMC partners with on a regular basis, throughout Boston and Chelsea. BIDMC also integrated the extensive community engagement and planning work that BIDMC is conducting as part of its Massachusetts Determination of Need New Inpatient Building Community -based Health Initiative (CHI) . Involvement in these four efforts allowed BIDMC to leverage res ources, and create a robust and inclusive CHNA and I mplementation Strategy. Involvement in these concurrent assessments also facilitated important collaboration between BIDMC and health service organizations across Boston. These partners hips were very prod uctive and will have a lasting positive impact when it comes to future assessments and community health improvement efforts. In October of 2019, BIDMC hired John Snow, Inc. (JSI), a public health consulting firm based in Boston , to integrate the informatio n gathered across these concurrent assessments and augment the information gathered where appropriate. BIDMC worked with JSI to ensure that the final BIDMC CHNA, including elements across all of its separate parts, engaged the necessary community constitue nts, incorporated comprehensive quantitative and qualitative information for all of the communities in its CBSA, and fulfilled Commonwealth and Federal Community Benefits requirements. BIDMC's CBC oversaw all aspects of the assessment and planning process and was integral to the development of the CHNA report and the implementation strategy. The assessment was also supported by BIDMC's Community Advisory Committee (CAC), which was initially constituted to oversee BIDMC's New Access Building Community -based Health Initiative. Both the CBC and CAC are made up of community members, service providers, and other key stakeholders that either live in and/or work with the neighborhoods in Boston that are part of BIDMC's CBSA. The expertise and knowledge that these groups brought to the process was invaluable. The following are detailed descriptions of each of the component parts of BIDMC's overall assessment. Collectively, the efforts described below exemplify BIDMC's commitment to a comprehensive, inclusive, enga ged, collaborative assessment and planning process. The efforts also show BIDMC's commitment to understanding unmet need, the underlying social determinants of health, and community engagement. Appendix A: Page 1 of 16All of these processes put a particular emphasis on engaging h ard to reach population segments that are often left out of these types of activities. BIDMC is extremely proud of its efforts over the past year. BIDMC Assessment Activities 2018 -2019 Methods Summary of Methods Applied Across all Assessment Components Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative iCHNA BILH and Other Hospital CHNAs BIDMC New Inpatient Building Community -based Health Initiative (CHI) Quantitative Data Demographic/ Socio -economic Data ( e.g., Age, gender, race/ethnicity, language, income) Social Determinants of Health Data ( e.g., Housing Transportation, crime) Epidemiologic Data (e.g., Disease prevalence, m orbidity and mortality ) Hospital Discharge Data ( e.g., Dischar ge Rates and Prevention Quality Indicators1) Qualitative Data / Community Engagement Key Informant Interviews ~ 70 interviews with health and social service providers, public health officials, advocates, residents, and other community Stakeholders Community Health Survey Responses ~ 4,500 survey responses from community residents Focus Groups ~ 16 focus groups wit h key population segments (e.g., Black/ African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, LG BTQ, or service provider groups) Community Meetings ~ 15 community meetings open to the public in neighborhoods across Boston and Chelsea Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative This assessment focused on the social determinants of health through the lens of health equity; it aimed to uncover and understand how a nd why individuals in certain Boston neighborhoods or population groups experience disparities in health outcomes and barriers to care based on socioeconomic status, race and ethnicity, health status, sexual orientation, gender identity, and other factors. The overall approach was participatory and collaborative, engaging community residents and stakeholders throughout the CHNA process. A Steering Committee was formed to oversee the process and provide strategic direction ; this 19 - member Committee included representatives from hospitals, health centers, public health organizations, and community representatives. An Operations Committee, including Steering Committee Co-Chairs and the Boston CHNA -CHIP Coordinator, was formed to address and resolve operational issues. Two work groups, the Secondary Data Work Group, and the Community Engagement Work Group, provided input and guidance throughout the process. These Work Groups were comprised of 1 PQIs are a set of measures that use hospital discharge data to identify quality of care for \"ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACS).\" These are conditions that can potentially be prevented or avoided given early intervention and appropriate levels of outpatient primary or specialty care. https://www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/modules/pqi_overview.aspx Appendix A: Page 2 of 16representatives from a range of organizations, including hospitals, h ealth centers, social services, community development, education, and others . Nancy Kasen, BIDMC's Director of Community Benefits was one of the Co -Chairs. Ms. Kasen and other staff members at BIDMC's Community Benefits Department participated in both wor kgroups. Health Resources in Action (HRiA), a non -profit public health organization, was hired by the Collaborative to provide guidance and facilitation of the assessment process, to collect and analyze data, and to develop report materials. Quantitative Approach and Methods The Boston CHNA -CHIP collaborative collected and analyzed secondary data on a wide range of issues from a variety of sources to identify community characteristics, barriers to care, risk factors, and disparities in health outcomes. T here was a particular focus on collecting data to characterize the social determinants of health (e.g., housing, transportation, and socioeconomic status) and to stratify data by Boston neighborhood, by race/ethnicity, age, and language status. Data source s include: Boston Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sur vey (BBRFSS) Youth Risk Behavioral Survey (YRBS) US Census Bureau American Community Survey Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA) Acute Hosp ital Case Mix Database Data were analyzed by o rganizations as cited in the sourcing notation throughout this document and the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Assessment report. Whenever possible, data was presented with confidence intervals to identify statistical significance (p<0.05). Qualitative Ap proach and Methods The assessment included a robust community engagement effort comprised of the following activities, as described in the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative report: Boston CHNA Community Survey (2,404 responses): A community survey was develop ed and administered over six weeks in February -March 2019. The survey focused on a range issues related to the social determinants of health, community perceptions, and access to care and was developed with extensive input from the Community Engagement Wor k Group and guided by existing validated questions from the field or used in other studies. The survey was pilot -tested in late January 2019, and the final instrument was launched in February 1, 2019 with wider dissemination starting the following week. Th e survey was administered on -line and via hard copy in seven languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Haitian Creole, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Arabic). Extensive outreach was conducted by Collaborative members to disseminate the survey via social media, in stitutional e -newsletters, e -mails to large networks, waiting rooms, 13 Boston Public Library neighborhood branches, community events, and large apartment buildings. Over 35 organizations assisted with survey dissemination. Additionally, Healthy Community Champions, an initiative of grassroots ambassadors, conducted targeted survey administration in specific neighborhoods. While strong efforts were made to conduct outreach across the City with a deeper dive within neighborhoods and population groups who ex perience disproportionate health burden, the community Appendix A: Page 3 of 16survey used a convenience sample. Because a convenience sample is a type of non -probability sampling, there is potential selection bias in who participated or was asked to participate in the survey. Du e to this, results cannot necessarily be generalized to the larger population. Additionally, some sub -group analyses consist of very small sub -sample sizes, these sub -group analyses are still presented in the report for population groups where data are lim ited from other sources (e.g., Haitian Creole speakers, non-binary and transgender individuals, etc.); however, given the small sub -sample sizes and convenience sampling methodology, results should be interpreted with caution. The table below includes a b reakdown of survey respondents from the neighborhoods that are part of BIDMC's CBSA: Respondents to Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Survey, by Neighborhood of Interest Neighborhood # of Survey Respondents (N=2,404) % of Survey Respondents % of Population in Boston Allston/Brighton 243 10.1% 9.5% Chinatown 185 7.7% 6.6% DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census, American Community Survey, 5 -Year Estimates, 2013 -2017 NOTE: For ACS data, neighborhoods were defined by Boston Public Health Commission using ZCTAs; Back Bay includes Back Bay, B eacon Hill, Downtown, North End, and West End; South End includes South End and Chinatown; Roxbury includes Roxbury and Mission Hil l Focus Groups (13): Thirteen focus groups were conducted with specific populations of interest: 12 focus groups conducted specifically for the collaborative CHNA and one additional focus group conducted by work group members who submitted notes for the CH NA. Focus groups were 90 -minute semi -structured conversations with approximately 8 -12 participants per group and aimed to delve deeply into community's needs, strengths, and opportunities for the future. Focus groups were conducted with the following popul ations: Female low -wage workers (e.g. housekeepers, childcare workers, hotel service workers, etc.) Male low -wage workers (e.g. janitorial staff, construction, etc.) Seniors (ages 65+) with complex, challenging issues (e.g. homebound, medical complication s) Residents who are housing insecure (no permanent address or close to eviction) Latino residents in East Boston (in Spanish) LGBTQ youth and young adults at risk of being homeless Immigrant parents of school age children (5 -18 years) Survivors of viol ence; mothers who have been impacted by violence Parents who live in public housing in Dorchester Appendix A: Page 4 of 16Chinese residents living in Chinatown (in Chinese) Haitian residents living in Mattapan (in Haitian Creole) Residents in active substance use recovery Additional focus group with notes provided: Chinese residents living in Chinatown A total of 104 community residents participated in focus groups, representing 13 neighborhoods across the city. Nearly half of focus group participants identified as Black o r African American (45%), a third of participants identified as Hispanic or Latino (34%), and 10% identified as White. The majority of participants identified as female (57%), 36% identified as male, and 7% identified as transgender or genderqueer. Fifteen community and social service organizations located throughout Boston assisted with recruiting participan ts and/or hosting focus groups.2 Key Informant Interviews (45): \"A total of 45 key informant interviews were completed, six of which were additional in terviews submitted by work group volunteers. Interviews were 45 -60 minute semi - structured discussions that engaged institutional, organizational, and community leaders and front -line staff across sectors. Discussions explored interviewees' experiences of a ddressing community needs and opportunities for future alignment, coordination, and expansion of services, initiatives, and policies. Sectors represented in these interviews included: public health, health care, housing and homelessness, transportation, co mmunity development, faith, education, public safety, environmental justice, government, workforce development, social services, food insecurity, business organizational staff that work with specific population such as youth, seniors, disabled, LGBTQ, and immigrants . Information from focus groups and key informant interviews were coded using Nvivo , a qualitative data analysis software, and analyzed thematically by data analysts for main categories and sub -themes. Analysts identified key themes that emerged across all groups and interviews as well as the unique issues that were noted for specific po pulations. Throughout the qualitative findings included in t he Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative report, the term \"participants\" is used to refer to focus group and key informant interview participants. Unique issues that emerged among a group of participants are specified as such (e.g., Spanish -speaking focus group participants, etc.). Frequency and intensity of discussions on a specific topic were key indicators used for extracting main themes. While neighborhood diffe rences are noted where appropriate, anal yses emphasized findings common across Boston. Selected paraphrased quotes \u2014without personal identifying information \u2014are presented in the narrative of this report to further illustrate points within topic areas.\"3 North Suffolk Integrated Community Health N eeds Assessment (iCHNA) Assessment Approach From the onset, the intention of the North Suffolk iCHNA was to develop broad regional plans to guide the three municipalities, services providers, public and private organizations, and health systems that serve the area. To be effective, these plans would be: 2 Boston CHNA -CHIP A: Page 5 of 16Comprehensive: involving a full range of stakeholders, data, and a broad definition of health and wellbeing to create a CHNA that would fulfill the needs of all Inclusive: ensure all segments of the popula tion would have a voice in process, data collection, and implementation plan Data -considered: gathering as much primary and secondary data on the health, wellbeing, and quality of life of residents through qualitative and quantitative methods in order to p rioritize health needs Collaborative: guiding and engaging stakeholders throughout the process for sound decision making, co -learning, and transparency In order to meet these values, the iCHNA was led by a Steering Committee . The Steering Committee was a selected group of leaders, including the executive chefs of each community, a representative of each Board of Health, leaders of organizations in the communities, and representatives from the five health systems that serve the area. Members of the Steeri ng Committee were selected to represent the communities and populations of Revere, Chelsea, and Winthrop. If a key population segment was missing from the Committee, specific agencies and representative were recruited. The Steering Committee set directio n and policy of the process; track progress toward completion of tasks; coordinate communication to key stakeholders and the public and make final decisions about priorities and implementation plans. The Steering Committee reviewed and informed CHNA findi ngs and reports and determined the priorities for the CHIP. The Steering Committee met every other month throughout the iCHNA and CHIP process. The meetings were listed on the CHNA website, and subcommittee members were invited as well. A Segment Inclus iveness and Social Determinant s of Health list was created in collaboration with the Steering Committee and the sub committees. When reviewing membership in all the committees, as well as collecting primary data, this list was consulted to ensure the iCHN A process and data collection were inclusive and representative of the communities. When planning for key informant interviews and focus groups, this list was used to identify leaders and groups to ensure that a variety of diverse individuals across mul tiple sectors and populations were included. Methodology & Engagement 1.Steering Committee: The Steering Committee was a selected group of leaders, including the executive chefs of each community, a representative of each Board of Health, leaders of organiza tions in the communities, and representatives from the five health systems that serve the area. The Steering Committee set direction and policy of the process; track progress toward completion of tasks; coordinate communication to key stakeholders and the public and make final decisions about priorities and implementation plans. The Steering Committee reviewed and informed CHNA findings and reports and determined the priorities for the CHIP. The Steering Committee met every other month throughout the CH NA and CHIP process. The meetings were listed on the CHNA website, and subcommittee members were invited as well. 2.Instrument Review Subcommittee : Fifteen people represented different organizations joined the subcommittee. The purpose of this committee wa s to create, review, and finalize the survey instrument, as well as the focus group and key informant interview guides. The subcommittee met 4 times to review past instruments, offer new questions in which to gather data, and assess the survey tool for li teracy. The fourth meeting was a joint meeting with the Community Appendix A: Page 6 of 16Engagement Subcommittee to brainstorm ways to distribute the survey and identify key informant interviews and organizations to assist with focus groups. 3.Community Engagement Subcommittee : Eighteen people represented different organizations joined the subcommittee. The purpose of the subcommittee was to identify organizations who had access to populations who might not otherwise be engaged in this process without intentional outreach. They we re also charged with recommending community engagement strategies, identifying potential community facilitators, reaching out to organizations and individuals for survey distribution and focus group coordination and supporting the communications of the process and final products. The subcommittee met 4 times, with the fourth meeting being a joint meeting with the Instrument Review subcommittee. 4.Data Analysis Subcommittee: Eleven people represented different organizations in the assessment process joined the subcommittee. The purpose of the subcommittee was to help analyze the data, present the findings back to the Steering Committee, and determine how the data will look in the reports. Members participated in three meetings to provide guidance on how the data should be organized, subpopulations to focus on, and how the data would be presented to the Steering Committee. The subcommittee determined the data should be organized based on the DPH Determination of Need (DoN) Health Priorities and the current Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS)/DPH focus issues. DPH DoN Health Priorities Social Environment Built Environment Housing Violence and Trauma Employment Education EOHHS/DPH Focus Issues Statewide trends and overall burden of morbidity and mortality point to: Substance use disorders (SUDs), Housing Stability/Homelessness , Mental illness and mental health , Chronic disease with a focus on Canc er, Heart Disease and Diabetes . Additionally, the subcommittee decided to focus on three specific populations that were of interest: 1. Youth, 2. Seniors, and 3. Foreign -born. The subcommittee provided feedback on the data that was included on data placem ats to present to the Steering Committee. Data placemats are a tool to communicate with stakeholders the key data themes and engage them in data interpretation (Pankaj, Veena. (October 2014). \"Data Placemats: A DataViz Technique to Improve Stakeholder Und erstanding of Evaluation Results.\" Paper presented at the American Evaluation Association Annual Conference, Denver, CO). 5.Website & Cable Access Panel: To promote the CHNA and CHIP process, keep communities up to date, and house the links to the survey, a website was created: Appendix A: Page 7 of 16www.northsuffolkassessment.com . The website was widely distributed through emails and flyers, with the website, emails, and flyers all available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, an d Arabic. To promote the website and the survey, a 12 -minute cable access show was recorded and widely distributed. The panel features the executive chefs of all three communities and was facilitated by the director of the Revere CARES coalition, who also translated the content in Spanish. 6.Quality of Life Survey : The anonymous survey assessed community perceptions of quality of life, health problems in the community, community strengths, safety, community changes and demographic information (including perceptions of personal health, food and housing stability, and utilization of select local resources). The survey was translated into Spanish, Portuguese, and Arabic, and was distributed widely via the web and in -person within each participating organization. A total of 1,827 individuals across Revere, Chelsea, and Winthrop responded to the survey. The survey was cleaned and analyzed in the statistical software, R. After cleaning the data, 99% of the data were still usable, making the total sample size of the community health survey 1,819. The data was stratified by community, live or work, age, sex, race, Hispanic/Latino, and foreign -born. a.Quality of Life Survey Data Analysis : As mentioned, in order to collect a robust and comprehensive sample of survey respondents, surveys were available in multiple languages. The majority of participants took the English survey (92%), followed by the Spanish survey (7.40%), Portuguese survey (0.38%) and the Arabic survey (0.22%). Due to the low response rate of the Portuguese and Arabic surveys, they were re -translated to English using Survey Monkey. However, because over 100 surveys were completed in Spanish, they were translated to English using R. Though data analysis primarily focused on calculating the frequencies of responses per question, it was essential to ensure that th e correct denominators were utilized. For most questions, the denominator calculated was based on the total number of individuals who responded to that particular question. However, when questions contained phrases such as \"Select all that apply\" or other phrases that denoted for respondents to select multiple choices, the statistical software SAS was used to determine how many individuals responded to these sets of questions. The denominator then became the total number of people who selected at least one response. Assuring that the correct denominators were used in the overall and stratified results ensures that our frequencies are as accurate and precise as possible. Since the survey was available to anyone who lived or worked in Chelsea, Revere or Wint hrop, some analyses were done that solely focused on how residents of these communities responded. Residents were defined as those who responded that they either lived or lived and work in either Chelsea, Revere or Winthrop. The data analysis sub - committee determined that the survey respondents who were foreign -born were a population of interest. The foreign -born population was defined as those who were residents (live or live and work in community) and those who responded that they have lived in the Unite d States within these parameters: \"Less than one year,\" \"one to three years,\" \"four to six years,\" or \"more than six years, but not my whole life.\" Those who responded that they have lived in the United States for their whole lives were defined as \"non -foreign born\" survey respondents. Youth were defined as those who responded that Appendix A: Page 8 of 16they were under 18 years old and seniors were defined as those who responded that they were 65 years old or older. While the cleaning the data, an interesting pattern was found. Individuals who identified as Hispanic/Latino struggled to respond what race they identified as. The question pertaining to race came before the question asking whether individuals identified as Hispanic/Latino. 116 survey respondents selected \"other\" as their race and wrote in a response that indicated that they were of Hispanic/Latino descent. One individual even wrote , \"Why isn't Hispanic/Latino an option?\" While many of these individuals selected that they were Hispanic/Latino, this indicates that indi viduals from North Suffolk (Chelsea, Revere and Winthrop) might struggle with their race identification or need more information about the differences between race and ethnicity. 7.Focus Groups : Qualitative data were collected through key informant intervie ws and focus groups with the help of a small group of volunteers from partner organizations and the CCHI Evaluation Team. Volunteers were trained on facilitation and note taking strategies in February 2019 prior to the start of qualitative data collection. Interview and focus group guides were created for facilitators and note takers with standard questions regarding perceptions about the health of the community, community assets, and pressing health issues. Once trained, volunteers traveled to participatin g organizations to facilitate focus groups. Key informant interviews were conducted both in -person and on the phone based on facilitator and interviewee availability. Potential focus group participants and key informants were identified by the North Suffo lk Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment Steering Committee using a segment inclusiveness worksheet to ensure that a variety of diverse individuals across multiple sectors and populations were included. A total of 22 focus groups were completed, 9 w ith staff and 13 with community residents, and 28 key informant interviews were conducted, resulting in a combined total of 241 people engaged through this process. Each interview/focus group lasted approximately 45 to 60 minutes. Community residents recei ved a $15 gift card at the end of the focus groups as compensation for their time. Upon completion of all focus groups and key informant interviews, the notes were read, reviewed, and coded to categorize the data and identify overarching, common themes. S everal themes were found across all three communities, while a few additional themes were found applicable to one or two communities. 8.Public Health Data : Public health data were gathered from the U.S. Census, MA Department of Education, MA Department of Public Health, local Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), Prevention Needs Assessment (PNA), local police departments and community -based organizations. Limitations As with all field resea rch, there are several data limitations to report. This assessment sought to obtain diverse participation in the community. Every effort was made to ensure broad distribution of the Quality of Life survey so that all groups in the community were well rep resented. The majority of survey respondents were white females despite this community outreach. However, there was a sufficient sample within each community to allow for analysis by sub -groups (e.g. male vs. female, Hispanic/Latino). Focus groups were c onducted in the communities to obtain the perspectives of youth, parents, immigrants, and non -English speakers, less likely to respond to surveys. Appendix A: Page 9 of 16Beth Israel Lahey Health (BILH) and Other Hospital Community Health Needs Assessments BIDMC leveraged inform ation from numerous hospitals within the BILH system (i.e., New England Baptist Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital - Needham, and Lahey Hospital Medical Center,) as well as other hospital s in Boston (i.e., Brigh am and Women's Hospital, Dana -Farber Ca ncer Institute, Boston Children's Hospital). These hospitals operate in BIDMC CBSA and, as a result, efforts were made to share information and align community engagement and assessment activities. Key Informant Interviews. Qualitative information from ke y informant interviews and meetings involving residents and key stakeholders in Lexington was shared by Lahey Hospital Medical Center in Burlington and New England Baptist Hospital in the Mission Hill neighborhood of Boston. Specifically, notes from three interviewees with Lexington Town Officials were shared, including interviews with the Public Health Nurse, the Environmental Health Agent, and the Director of the Human Services Department. In addition , notes with 12 key informants from throughout the Miss ion Hill and Roxbury community were shared, including community residents, social service providers, public housing administrators, and community advocacy organizations. Focus Groups. Information was also gathered throu gh focus groups and key informant interviews. In total, New England Baptist Hospital organized two focus gro ups involving more than 20 people . Specifically, focus groups were held with the New England Baptist Hospital Patient Family Advisory Committee, which is dominated by community members and long -term patients from Mission Hill and a meeting with the Mission Hill Legacy Project was conducted during one of the Legacy Project's Birthday Parties for older adults on Mis sion Hill. Community Meeting. Qualitative information was gathered through two c ommunity meeting s. One in Mission Hill/Roxbury that was jointly hosted by BIDMC and New England Baptist Hospital (NEBH), along with Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston Children's Hospital and Dana -Farber Cancer Institute . 48 peop le participated in this meeting held at the Tobin/Mission Hill Community Center. Another in Needham that was hosted by Beth Israel Deaconness - Needham. This meeting was attended by approximatel y 40 health and social service providers, other community stakeholders, and residents from Needham. Community Health Survey. Qualitative information was gathered through a community health survey , conducted by New England Baptist Hospital as part of their CHNA activities , which collected information from more than 100 residents of Mission Hill. BIDMC New Inpatient Building Community -based Health Initiative In addition to the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative, th e iCHNA, and numerous hospital CHNA efforts, BIDMC conducted community engagement, assessment, and prioritization activities through its Determination of Need New Inpatient Building Community -based Health Initiative (CHI). BIDMC is in the process of const ructing a new inpatient building - the first new building that BIDMC has built in over 20 years. Due to the size of this capital expenditure, the MDPH requires that BIDMC go through a Determination of Ne ed (DoN) process; this process directs BIDMC to dedic ate 5% of total project costs towards a Community -based Health Initiative (CHI) to improve the health of residents in communities that are part of the BIDMC's CBSA. Over the next five to eight years, BIDMC will invest approximately Appendix A: Page 10 of 16$30 million towards the CHI project . $7.5 Million (25%) of BIDMC's $30 Million will be given to the Commonwealth and be invested in Commonwealth -wide community health improvement initiatives. The remaining $22.5 Million will be allocated and directed by BIDMC's CAC in community h ealth improvement initiatives in BIDMC's CBSA neighborhoods in Boston and Chelsea. Per Commonwealth DoN requirements, BIDMC is required to implement a robust community engagement effort and facilitate a prioritization process with BIDMC's CAC to identify t he leading community health priorities as well as the communities and priority population segments that will be supported by BIDMC's CHI funds. BIDMC 's Community Advisory Committee (CAC) is comprised of community residents and stakeholders, who inform and advise the NIB -CHI process, including com munity engagement efforts to collect data on neighborhood and community health priorities. The findings from these activities were incorporated into BIDMC's CBSA CHNA. Community Engagement Efforts To engage the com munity and provide vital information to help the CAC to identify and prioritize community health issues to be funded through the NIB -CHI investment, a series of five (5) community meetings were held in the Boston neighborhoods that are part of BIDMC's CBSA , with approximately 185 total attendees (Table 2). Meetings were held between June 2 and June 17, 2019.

Appendix A: Page 11 of 16Special emphasis was made to encourage non -English speaking residents and other hard -to-reach segments of the population who are often left out of community engagement activities, to participate. Below are characteristics of individuals wh o participated across the five meetings. Race/Ethnicity: Seventy -seven percent (77%) of participants reported as a non -White race. The largest racial/ethnic group reported as Asian, non -Hispanic (43%), followed by White, non - Hispanic (23%), Black/African American, non -Hispanic (16%), Other Race, non -Hispanic (8 %), Hispanic/Latino of any race (6%), multi -race, Language: Fifty -three percent (53%) of participants chose to take the survey in English, 22% in Mandarin, 8% in Haitian Creole, 7% i n Vietnamese, 4% in Russian, 4% in Spanish, and 1% in Cantonese Age: Thirty -nine percent (39%) of participants reported that they were 65 years old or older, 32% reported that they were between the ages of 35 and 64, 19% reported that they were between th e ages of 18 and 34, and 10% were under 18 Gender Identity: Sixty -seven percent (67%) reported as female, 31% as male, and 2% as either genderqueer or an additional gender category Resident/Non -resident: Sixty -one percent (61%) reported that they were re sidents of the CBSA and 47% reported that they were a representative of a community organization At the outset of the meetings, staff from BIDMC and JSI provided background information on the NIB CHI, discussed the six (6) community health priorities identified by the NIB CHI CAC (i.e., housing, education, jobs/financial security, mental health, substance use, and violence), and gave participants the opportunity to add additional priorities that were important to them and their communities. Participants were then split up into small groups and were given the opportunity to discuss the Community Advisory Committee priority areas. In the small group discussions, participants were asked to clarify leading concerns fo r each priority area and to provide input on how funds should be spent to address the issue. JSI staff then provided brief summaries of the key themes discussed in their respective group and meeting participants were asked to individually vote across the p riority areas and strategic ideas to identify ones that they thought were most important. From these community meetings, a set of community health priority areas emerged: housing, education, access to care, mental health, jobs and financial security, viole nce, substance use disorder, wellness and chronic disease, elder health, and environmental health. Considering the outcomes of these community meetings, along with experience and understanding of the relevant communities, the CAC arrived at four community health priority areas: housing, jobs and financial security, behavioral health, and healthy neighborhoods . NIB-CHI Community Health Priority Areas HousingJobs and Financial Security Behavioral HealthHealthy Neighborhoods Appendix A: Page 12 of 16BIDMC's Independent Community Health Needs Assessment Activities As mentioned above, in October of 2018, BIDMC hired JSI to integrate the information gathered across the concurrent assessment and planning activities discussed above and augment the information gathered where necessary. BIDMC's additional efforts ensured that BIDMC's CHNA engaged the necessary community constituents, incorporated informa tion from all of the communities in its CBSA, and fulfilled Commonwealth and Federal Community Benefits requirements. BIDMC's additional, independent assessment and planning activities were conducted in three phases. First, BIDMC collected, analyzed and i ntegrated additional quantitative data from various sources to ensure that all of the communities that are part of BIDMC's CBSA were included in the assessment (Phase I). In this case, particular attention was made to gather information from the communiti es that are part of BIDMC's CBSA that are outside of Boston and Chelsea. Namely, BIDMC operates a pain center in Brookline, a Cancer Center in Needham, and an outpatient, multi -specialty clinic in Lexington. Second, BIDMC engaged additional community resid ents, key stakeholders, and service providers through key informant interviews (Phase II). Third, BIDMC integrated and prioritized the findings compiled and analyzed across all of the various concurrent assessment activities (Phase III). Once the findings were prioritized, BIDMC then worked with JSI to develop this report and the associated Implementation Strategy (Phase III). Following is more detailed descriptions of the leadership and oversight of BIDMC's CHNA, additional data collection efforts, and th e prioritization process, as well as the Resource Inventory and the Community Benefits Evaluation. Leadership and Oversight. As mentioned above, BIDMC's CBSA CHNA, including the collective efforts with the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative, the iCHNA , and numerous other hospitals within and outside of BILH, were overseen by the CBC. The CBC is comprised of key community stakeholders and BIDMC leadership and provided valuable insight on the assessment approach, including the community engagement strate gy, preliminary findings, and strategic planning. The CAC also supported BIDMC's CHNA by providing their knowledge and experience living in or work with the neighborhoods of Boston and Chelsea. It is also important to note that BIDMC's Community Benefits S enior Leadership Team (CBSLT) played a critical role in the assessment and planning process. They were consulted throughout the assessment and, along with the CBC, were instrumental in the prioritization and planning process. The CBLT included key BIDMC administrators and clinicians. Quantitative and Qualitative Data Collection. BIDMC's CBSA CHNA includes an extensive amount of additional quantitative and qualitative data that further characterize the communities in BIDMC's CBSA, including the health statu s of its residents. This data was used to augment data from existing assessments , particularly for communities in Boston and Chelsea. It was also used to capture information from communities in BIDMC's CBSA that are outside of Boston and Chelsea, in the surrounding communities of Brookline, Chestn ut Hill, Lexington, and Needham . Since Chestnut Hill is not a registered municipality, data is reported for the communities that comprise it (Boston, Brookline, and Newton). Secondary data sources included: Appendix A: Page 13 of 16U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates ( 2013 -2017 ) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey, 2017 Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education: School and District Profiles (2017, and 2018 -2019) FBI Uniform Crime Repo rts (2017) Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Registry of Vital Records and Statistics (2015) Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Bureau of Substance Abuse Services (2017) Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Annual Reports on Births ( 2016) Massachusetts Bureau of Infectious Disea se and Laboratory Sciences (2017 ) Massachusetts Center for Health Information Analysis (CHIA) Hospital Profiles (FY 2013 -2017) Massachusetts Center for Health Information Analysis (CHIA) Hospital Discharges (2017) Massachusetts Healthy Aging Collaborative, Community Profiles (2018) Whenever possible, confidence intervals were analyzed to test for statistically significant differences between municipal and Commonwealth data points. BIDMC CHNA also included some m ore refined analysis of hospital discharge data compiled by the Massachusetts Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA). This analysis focused on analyzing Ambulatory Care Sensitive conditions, which allow for the assessment of the strength of a co mmunity's primary care system and its ability to prevent or avoid hospitalizations. A comprehensive Data Book is included in Appendix B. BIDMC's CBSA assessment also collected a limited amount of qualitative information to augment the considerable amount of information collected from the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative, the iCHNA, other hospital CHNA activities, and BIDMC's CHI. This qualitative data gathering focused on filling gaps in information in Brookline, Chestnut Hill, Lexington, and Needham, which were not covered by the iCHNA and the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative. Data sources, associated tools, lists of participants, and other materials are included in Appendix A with other more detailed information on the BIDMC CBSA approach and the CBSA Detailed Community Engagement Summary in Appendix C. Prioritization. During Phases I and II, BIDMC's CBC was provided updates on the CBSA assessment to keep them informed of progress and our preliminary findings. In Phase II, a prioritization meeting was held with BIDMC's CBC. During this meeting, quantitative and qualitative dat a findings, including information from the B oston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative the BIDMC CHI were reviewed. The CBC then participated in a robust discussion of all of the findings and based on this discussion, voted to approve a set of community health priorities and priority population segments that would be used to develop BIDMC's implementation strategy. Following the CBC planning and prioritization meeting, a similar meeting was organized with BIDMC's CBSLT. During this meeting, the CBSLT also reviewed key findings from across all of the concurrent assessment activities as well as priorities agreed on by the CBC. Based on this discussion they voted on a set of priorities that were incorporated into BIDMC's CHNA and t he IS. Appendix A: Page 14 of 16Approval/Adoption and Public Comment. The CHNA and IS were distributed and presented to the CBC on September 5, 2019 and, with their approval, presented to the Board of Directors for approval on September 18, 2019. As with every CHNA, BIDMC's 2019 CHNA has been made available site (https://www.bidmc.org/about -bidmc/helping -our-community/community - initiatives/community -benefits). Comments are welcome and encouraged and contact information for BIDMC's Director of Community Benefits is both on the website and in Appendix E of this report. There were no written comments or oral comments received on BIDMC's prior (FY 2016) CHNA or IS. Resource Inventory. Federal and Commonwealth requirements indicate that a Resource Inventory should be cr eated to inform the extent to which there are gaps in health -related services. Working with BIDMC, JSI compiled a list of resources across the broad continuum of services, including clinical health care services, community health and social services, and p ublic health resources. This was done primarily by compiling information from existing resource inventories and community partner lists from BIDMC. Information was also compiled from membership lists of the existing community health coalitions and from CHN A interviews. JSI reviewed BIDMC's FY 2018 Annual Report of Community Benefits activities submitted to the MA AGO , which included a listing of partners, as well as publicly available lists of local resources. The goal of this process was to identify key pa rtners who may or may not b e already collaborating with BIDMC . The resource inventory can be found in Appendix D. Community Benefits Evaluation. BIDMC's contract with JSI included funds to conduct a community benefits evaluation that assessed the impact of BIDMC existing community benefits activities. More specifically, JSI staff reviewed the Fiscal Year 2017 Community Benefits Report that BIDMC su bmitted to the MA AGO in April 2018. Activities reported in this report were abstracted and individually scored. JSI determined the intensity of each activity by coding three specific attributes according to a proven methodology developed by the Robert Woo d Johnson Foundation. The three attributes are: Behavioral Intention: Providing information; enhancing skills, services, or support; modifying access, and opportunities; modifying policies and broader conditions; Duration: One-time, occurring more than once, or ongoing; and Reach: Proportion -high, medium, low of the total priority population involved in or touched through the activity A JSI evaluation team member rated each activity attribute on a scale of 0.1 (minimum) to 1.0 (maximum) and calculated a single intensity score using a defined protocol (Table 1). A second evaluation team member coded a randomly selected number of activities to ensure inter -rater reliability. A score of 0.1 - 0.5 was given dependent upon how m any times and/or how long the activity was implemented during FY2017. If the duration or reach was unclear, the evaluators scored the attribute the lowest possible score (0.1). The formula used to calculate an intensity score for each activity was: Behav ioral value + duration value + reach value Appendix A: Page 15 of 16Scores could range from 0.3 (lowest intensity and least likely to impact long -term outcomes) to 3.0 (highest intensity and most likely to impact long -term outcomes). A total composite score for all activities wa s then summed across all activities. Community Benefits Evaluation Scoring Protocol A more detailed summary of the Community Benefits Evaluation can be found in Appendix G.

BIDMC CHNA Databook 2019 August 2019 Appendix B: Page 12 of 13Notes: 1. Demographics: Each American Community Survey (ACS) estimate is accompanied by the upper and lower bounds of the 90 percent confidence interval. A 90 percent confidence interval can be interpreted roughly as providing 90 percent certainty that the true number falls between the upper and lower bounds. 2. Clinical indicators: All data provided by MA DPH are estimates associated with some margin of error. Percentages are accompanied by 95% confidence intervals, meaning the true value of the measure falls within the range 95% of the time. The difference between two groups is statistically significant if the 95% confidence intervals surrounding these two estimates do not overlap For CHIA data, confidence intervals for year over year reflect change within geography rather than difference from statewide benchmark BIDMC CHNA Databook 2019 August 2019 Appendix B: Page 13 of 13APPENDIX C: Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment Overview of Community Engagement Activities BIDMC recognizes the importance of collaborating with residents, advocates, service providers, Commonwealth and local public officials, representatives from community -based organizations, and other stakeholders when conducting assessment and planning proje cts of this kind. Community engagement is integral to BIDMC's mission and great efforts were taken to ensure that BIDMC's CHNA included substantial efforts to engage community residents and other community stak eholders across its Community Benefits Service Area ( CBSA )1. As part of these efforts, s pecial emphasis was made on reaching out to those who are hard -to-reach and often excluded f rom these types of assessments , including non -English speakers or those with limited English proficiency, racial ly/ethnic ally diverse, recent immigrants, LGBTQ populations, low income individuals/families , individuals and families impacted by incarceration, older adults, and youth . These engagement efforts spanned all phases of the assessment from assessment planning, to data collection, data analysis, prioritization , planning, and reporting, and finally to ongoing monitoring and evaluation. In collaboration with its assessment and community engagement partners, BIDMC applied MDPH's Community Engagement Standards for Communit y Health Planning as a guide.2 As a result, BIDMC employed a variety of strategies to ensure that community members were informed, consulted, involved, and empowered throughout the assessment process. 1 In addition to the Medical C enter in the Longwood area of Boston, BIDMC operates licensed multi - specialty outpatient facilities in Chelsea, Lexington, and Chestnut Hill, as well as a cancer center in Needham and a pain c enter in Brookline. BIDMC also oper ates a licensed health center in Bowdoin/Geneva and has strong, long -standing partnerships with an additional four Boston Federally Qualified Health Centers within its Community Benefits Service Area (CBSA). The communities in which these facilities operat e define BIDMC's CBSA. Accordingly, BIDMC's CBSA is defined as the city of Chelsea and the Boston neighborhoods of Allston/Brighton, Bowdoin /Geneva, Chinatown, Fenway/Kenmore, and Roxbury/Mission Hil l, as well as the municipalities of Lexington, Needham, a nd Chestnut Hill. Since Chestnut Hill is not a registered municipality, data is reported for the communities that comprise it (Boston, Brookline, and Newton). 2 https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2017/01/vr/guidelines -community -engagement.pdf Appendix C: Page 1 of 22Community Engagement Continuum As discussed in the body of this report, it would be difficult to overstate BIDMC's commitment to robust, collaborative, inclusive, transparent, and objective assessment and community engagement process. BIDMC's Community Benefits staff dedicated countless hours of their tim e and other resources, over nearly a year, to conduct this Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA), including an extensive series of community engagement activities. Below is a summary table outlining the breadth of engagement activities. Following the t able are specific details of the breadth of BIDMC's engagement activities. BIDMC Assessment Activities 2018 -2019 Methods Summary of Community Engagement Methods Applied Across all Assessment Components Key Informant Interviews ~ 70 interviews with health and social service providers, public health officials, advocates, residents, and other community Stakeholders Community Health Survey Responses ~ 4,500 survey responses from community residents Focus Groups ~ 16 focus groups with key population segments (e.g., Black/African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, LGBTQ, or service provider groups) Community Meetings ~ 15 community meetings open to the public in neighborhoods across Boston and Chelsea There are two components of this summary. First is a detailed description of the community engagement activities that were conducted either directly by BIDMC or in directly in partnership with other hospitals, hospital collaboratives, or other community partners. These descriptions include an explanation of the engagement activity , where it took place, and when the activity occurred, as well as an account of the number of individuals involved, meetings held, or focus groups conducted. For the activities that were conducted by BIDMC directly, the tools (e.g., key informant guides, focus group guides , or surveys ) that were used to engage the community are also provided. Second, there is a table at the end of this appendix that describes the activities and strategies that were applied as part of BIDMC's CHNA process that illustrate how community members were engaged in the Appendix C: Page 2 of 22assessment across the continuum of different levels of engagement (e.g., informed, consulted, involved, and empowered ) per MDPH's Community Engagement Standards for Community Health Planning . 1.Description of Community Engagement Activities Across Different Aspects of Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative The Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative conducted a n extensive amount of engagement activities.

To be effective, these plans would be: Comprehensive: involving a full range of stakeholders, data, and a broad definition of health and wellbeing to create a CHNA that would fulfill the needs of all Inclusive: ensure all segments of the population would have a voice in process, data collection, and implementation plan Data -considered: gathering as much primary and secondary data on the health, wellbeing, and quality of life of residents through qualitative and quantitative methods in order to prioritize health needs Collaborative: guiding and engaging stakeholders throughout the process for sound decision making, co -learning, and transparency With this in mind, the Steering Committee for the iCHNA conducted an extensive amount of community engagement. The following is a description of these activities. 1.Steering Committee: The Steering Committee was a selected group of leaders, including a represent ative of each Board of Health, health and social service providers, other community stakeholders, and leaders of organizations in the community . The Steering Committee set direction and policy of the process; track progress toward com pletion of tasks; coordinate communication to key stakeholders and the public and make final decisions about priorities and implementation plans. The Steering Committee reviewed and informed CHNA findings and reports and determined the priorities for the CHIP. The Steering Committee met every other month throughout the roughly 10-month CHNA and CHIP process. The meetings were listed on the CHNA website, and subcommittee members were invited as well. 2.Community Engagement Subcommittee : Eighteen people re presented a broad cross section of community stakeholders joined the subcommittee. The purpose of the subcommittee was to identify organizations who had access to populations who might not otherwise be engaged in this process without intentional outreach. They were also charged with recommending community engagement strategies, identifying potential community facilitators, reaching out to organizations and individuals for survey distribution and focus group coordination and supporting the communications of the process and final products. The subcommittee met 4 times, with the fourth meeting being a joint meeting with the Instrument Review subcommittee. 3.Website & Cable Access Panel: To promote the CHNA and CHIP process, ensure that the community had the opp ortunity to engage the process, keep communit y members up to date, and house the links to the survey, a website was created: www.northsuffolkassessment.com . The website was widely distributed through em ails and flyers, with the website, emails, and flyers all available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Arabic. Appendix C: Page 6 of 224.Quality of Life Survey : The anonymous survey assessed community perceptions of quality of life, health problems in the community, community st rengths, safety, community changes and demographic information (including perceptions of personal health, food and housing stability, and utilization of select local resources). The survey was translated into Spanish, Portuguese, and Arabic, and was distri buted widely via the web and in -person within each participating organization. A total of 1,827 individuals across Revere, Chelsea, and Winthrop responded to the survey. 5.Focus Groups : Qualitative data were collected through focus groups with the help of a small group of volunteers from partner organizations and the CCHI Evaluation Team. Focus group guides were created for facilitators and note takers with standard questions regarding perceptions about the health of t he community, community assets, and pressing health issues. Focus group participants were identified by the North Suffolk Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment Steering Committee using a segment inclusiveness worksheet to ensure that a variety of di verse individuals across multiple sectors and populations were included. A total of 22 focus groups were completed, 9 with staff from community -based organizations and 13 with community residents resu lting in a combined total of 212 people engaged through this process. Each focus group lasted approximately 45 to 60 minutes. Community residents received a $15 gift card at the end of the focus groups as compensation for their time. 6.Key Informant Interview : In addition, q ualitative data were collected through key informant interviews with the help of a small group of volunteers from partner organization s and the CCHI Evaluation Team. Interview and focus group guides were created for facilitators and note takers with standard questions regarding perceptions abo ut the health of the community, community assets, and pressing health issues. Key informant interviews were conducted both in -person and on the phone based on facilitator and interviewee availability. Key informants were identified by the North Suffolk Int egrated Community Health Needs Assessment Steering Committee using a segment inclusiveness worksheet to ensure that a variety of diverse individuals across multiple sectors and populations were included. A total of 28 interviews were conducted. Each interv iew lasted approximately 45 to 60 minutes. Beth Israel Lahey Health (BILH) and Other Hospital Community Health Needs Assessments BIDMC and numerous hospitals within the BILH system (i.e., New England Baptist Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital - Needham, and Lahey Hospital Medical Center,) and other hospital s in Boston (i.e., Brigh am and Women's Hospital, Dana -Farber Cancer Institute, Boston Children's Hospital) conducted meetings jointly and shared information to inform each other's assessments . The se hospitals operate in BIDMC CBSA and, as a result, efforts were made to share information and align community engagement and assessment activities whenever possible . Key Informant Interviews. Qualitative information from ke y informant interviews and meetings involving residents and key stakeholders in Lexington was shared by Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital - Appendix C: Page 7 of 22Needham in Needham, Lahey Hospital Medical Center in Burlington (who serves Lexington) , and New Engl and Baptist Hospital in the Mission Hill Neigh borhood of Boston.

BIDMC New Inpatient Building Community -based Health Initiative In addition to the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative, the iCHNA, and numerous hospital CHNA efforts, BIDMC conducted community engagement, assessment, and prioritization activities through its Determination of Need New Inpatient Building Community -based Health Initiative (CHI). Per Commonwealth DoN requirements, BIDMC is required to implement a robust community engagement Appendix C: Page 14 of 22effort and facilitate a prioritization process with the BIDMC's Community Advisory Committee (CAC), which oversee the CHI, to identify the leading community health priorities as well as the communities and priorit y population segments that will be supported by BIDMC's CHI funds. BIDMC 's CAC is comprised of community residents and stakeholders, who inform and advise the NIB -CHI process, including com munity engagement efforts to collect data on neighborhood and comm unity health priorities. The findings from these activities were incorporated into BIDMC's CBSA CHNA. Community Engagement Efforts To engage the community and provide vital information to help the CAC to identify and prioritize community health issues to b e funded through the NIB -CHI investment, a series of five (5) community meetings were held in the Boston neighborhoods that are part of BIDMC's CBSA, with approximately 185 total attendees (Table 2). Meetings were held between June 2 and June 17, 2019. NIB-CHI Community Engagement Efforts Neighborhood Date/Time Location Languages available for Interpretation/Translation # of Attendees Allston/Brighton June 11, 2019 6 - 8 PM Charles River Community Health center Cantonese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Vietnamese 32 Chinatown June 2, 2019 10 AM - 12 PM South Cove Community Health Center Cantonese, Mandarin 25 Bowdoin -Geneva (Dorchester) June 10, 2019 6 - 8 PM St. Peter's Teen Center Cape Verdean Creole, Haitian Creole, Spanish 40 Fenway/Kenmore June 12, 2019 6 - 8 PM Morville House Cantonese, Russian, Spanish 55 Roxbury/Mission Hill June 17, 2019 6 - 8 PM Bruce Bolling Building Haitian Creole, Spanish 33 The primary goal of these meetings was to ensure that residents of the communities in Boston that are part of BIDMC's CBSA, as well as staff from community -based organizations that operate in those areas, were given the opportunity to: Learn about the CH I Share their ideas on how NIB CHI funds should be spent Vote on community health priorities and strategic ideas for funding. Special emphasis was made to encourage non -English speaking residents and other hard -to-reach segments of the population who are often left out of community engagement activities, to participate. Below are characteristics of individuals who participated across the five meetings. Race/Ethnicity: Seventy -seven percent (77%) of participants reported as a non -White race. The largest rac ial/ethnic group reported as Asian, non -Hispanic (43%), followed by White, non - Hispanic (23%), Black/African -Hispanic (16%), Other C: -race, non Fifty -three percent (53%) of participants chose to take the survey in English, 22% in Mandarin, 8% in Haitian Creole, 7% in Vietnamese, 4% in Russian, 4% in Spanish, and 1% in Cantonese Age: Thirty -nine percent (39%) of participants reported that they were 65 years old or older, 32% reported that they were between the ages of 35 and 64, 19% reported that they were between the ages of 18 and 34, and 10% were under 18 Gender Identity: Sixty -seven percent (67%) rep orted as female, 31% as male, and 2% as either genderqueer or an additional gender category Resident/Non -resident: Sixty -one percent (61%) reported that they were residents of the CBSA and 47% reported that they were a representative of a community organi zation At the outset of the meetings, staff from BIDMC and JSI provided background information on the NIB CHI, discussed the six (6) community health priorities identified by the NIB CHI CAC (i.e., housing, educ ation, jobs/financial security, mental health, substance use, and violence), and gave participants the opportunity to add additional priorities that were important to them and their communities. Participants were then split up into small groups and were gi ven the opportunity to discuss the Community Advisory Committee priority areas. In the small group discussions, participants were asked to clarify leading concerns for each priority area and to provide input on how funds should be spent to address the issu e. JSI staff then provided brief summaries of the key themes discussed in their respective group and meeting participants were asked to individually vote across the priority areas and strategic ideas to identify ones that they thought were most important. From these community meetings, a set of community health priority areas emerged: housing, education, access to care, mental health, jobs and financial security, violence, substance use disorder, wellness and chronic disease, elder health, and environmental health. Considering the outcomes of these community meetings, along with experience and understanding of the relevant communities, the CAC arrived at four community health priority areas: housing, jobs and financial security, behavioral health, and health y neighborhoods . BIDMC's Independent Community Health Needs Assessment Activities As mentioned above, in October of 2018, BIDMC hired John Snow, Inc. (JSI) to integrate the information gathered across the concurrent assessment and planning activities disc ussed above and augment the engagement and assessment activities where necessary. BIDMC's additional efforts ensured that NIB-CHI Community Health Priority Areas HousingJobs and Financial Security Behavioral HealthHealthy Neighborhoods Appendix C: Page 16 of 22BIDMC's CHNA engaged the necessary community constituents, incorporated information from all of the communities in its CBSA, and fulfi lled Commonwealth and Federal Community Benefits requirements. Following is a more detailed description of the additional engagement efforts conducted independently by BIDMC to augment the activities of its partners. Additional Community Engagement Activities. Engagement through the BIDMC Community Benefits Committee (CBC) and the Community Care Alliance (CCA) Board of Managers and Medical Directors. BIDMC's Community Benefit s Committee (CBC) also supported BIDMC's engagement efforts. The CBC is made up of community members, service providers, and other key stakeholders that either live in or work in Chelsea and/or the neighborhoods in Boston that are part of the CBSA. The CBC oversaw every aspect of the needs assessment across all facets but they also provided expertise and guidance related to service area characteristics and community need. The CBC met quarterly during the course of the assessment, were updated extensively at each meeting, and provided important input. The assessment, including the community engagement activities, were also greatly informed and supported by staff and clinicians at the community health centers who are part of BIDMC's Community Care Alliance (CC A). These health centers are a major part of Boston's health care safety net and do excellent work on behalf of some of Boston's most underserved populations. Senior administrative and clinical staff from the health centers sit on two b oards, the CCA Board of Managers and the CCA Board of Medical Directors. Like the CBC, these Boards met quarterly over the course of the CHNA activities and provided important information related to community need and helped BIDMC to engage residents from the communities they serve . Key Informant Interviews Three additional internal interviews were conducted along with 12 interviews with key stakeholders from communities in BIDMC's CBSA that are outside of Boston and Chelsea, namely Brookline, Chestnut Hill, Lexington, and Ne edham. Since Chestnut Hill is not a registered municipality, information in this case was gathered from the communities that comprise it (Boston, Brookline, and Newton).

Introduction: As you may know, BIDMC is conducting a Community Health Ne eds Assessment (CHNA) to understand the health needs of those living in its service area. This assessment, and a subsequent Implementation Strategy, is part of BIDMC's efforts to improve community h ealth status and develop a sound population health plan for its service area. The assessment is also required of all non -profit hospitals to meet state Attorney General and Federal IRS requirements. The Implementation Strategy will outline how the hospita l will work to address health needs and factors leading to poor health, as well as ways in which it will build on the community's strengths. It is therefore extremely important that the Hospital hear from a broad range of people living, working, and learn ing in the community. JSI has been contracted by the Hospital to conduct the assessment, which will include interviews, a Community Health Survey, and focus groups. This interview is part of the data collection and should take between 30-60 minutes. To ens ure our data reflect your community or the community you serve, it is important that you speak openly and honestly. We will be taking notes during the conversation, but will not link your name or personal information to your quotes without your permission. Do you have any questions before I get started? Appendix C: Page 18 of 22Question 1: Could you tell me more about yourself? How long have you worked at [name of organization]? Are you also a resident of a community within the service area? Probe for information on programs/servi ces offered through their organization, populations they work with, etc. Question 2: The assessment is looking at health defined broadly - beyond clinical health issues, we a re also looking at the root causes most commonly associated with ill -health (e.g. housing, transportation, employment/workforce, etc.) What do you see as the major contributors to poor health for those in the service area? Try to identify top 2 -3 Question 3: What clinical health issues (e.g. substance use, mental health, cancer, overwei ght/obesity, etc.) do you think are having the biggest impact on those in the service area? Try to identify top 2 -3 Question 4: What segments of the population have the most significant health needs or are most vulnerable? (e.g. young children, low -income, non-English speakers, older adults, etc.) Do you see this changing in the future? Improving? Getting worse? Question 5: How effectively do you think [Hospital] is currently meeting the needs of the community? Are there specific programs offered by [Hospit al] that stand out to you as working well to address the needs of the community? Question 6: Where do you see opportunities for [Hospital] to implement programs/services to address community health needs? Question 7: Are there programs or services offered by other community organizations that you think are working well to address the needs of the community? Mention that we will be compiling a list of community organizations/resources for the Resource Inventory Question 8: As we explained at the beginning of this interview, we will be making an effort to gather input from community residents as part of this assessment. Can you recommend any strategies to engage hard -to-reach populations? Any coalitions or advocac y groups that work with hard -to-reach populations? Any existing meeting groups you think it would be appropriate to reach out to? Question 9: Finally, we are working to gather quantitative data to characterize health status - this includes demographic and socioeconomic data, and disease -specific incidence, hospitalization, emergency department, and mortality data wherever it is available. Do you know of, or use, any local data sources (e.g. reports, other needs assessments, etc.)? 2.Community Engagement Acti vities Across MDPH's Engagement Continuum As discussed above, BIDMC, in collaboration with its partners across the CBSA (e.g., the Boston CHNA - CHIP Collaborative , the iCHNA, other BILH and hospital partners), used MDPH's Community Engagement Standards for Community Health Planning as a guide. As a result, BIDMC employed a variety of strategies across all levels of engagement to ensure that community members were informed, consulted, involved, and empowered through out the assessment process. The t able below i ncludes 1) a description of the goal for each level of community engagement, 2) examples of activities and strategies within each level, and 3) a listing of the a ctivities undertaken b y BIDMC and its assessment partners for each level of engagement. Appendix C: Page 19 of 22Community Engagement Activities across the Continuum Inform: Provide community with balanced and objective information to assist them in understanding the problem, alternatives, opportunities, and/or solution s Examples: Fact sheets, web sites, open houses BIDMC CHI Engagement: A web site was developed to inform the community on the CHI purpose, activities, and findings. Community Advisory Committee meeting agendas, materials, and minutes were posted for the public to access. Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative: A web site was developed to keep the public informed of the assessment process and opportunities for involvement. iCHNA: A web site was developed to keep the public informed of the assessment proc ess and opportunities for involvement. Consult: To obtain community feedback on analysis, alternatives, and/or solutions Examples: Public comments, focus groups, surveys, community meetings BIDMC CBSA Assessment: Key informant interviews were conducted with BIDMC leadership and community stakeholders. BIDMC CHI Engagement: Community meetings were held in each of the CBSA Boston neighborhoods. Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative: Key informant interviews, focus groups, a survey, and community meetings were c onducted to consult community residents and stakeholders on community health issues iCHNA: Key informant interviews, focus groups, and a survey were conducted to consult community residents and stakeholders on community health issues Involve: To work directly with community throughout the process to ensure their concerns and aspirations are consistently understood and considered Examples: Workshops, deliberative polling, advisory bodies BIDMC CHI Engagement: At community meetings, participants were engaged to prioritize community health issues. The results of these prioritization processes were used to arrive at a set of final community health priorities. Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative: An integrated analysis of findings from quantitative and qualitative data was done to arrive at a set of preliminary community health priorities. Through a series of meetings with community residents and stakeholders, a final set of priorities were developed. Community residents and stakeholders were also involved in determining goals, objectives, and strategies within each priority area. Additionally, the Boston Public Health Commission organized four Community Health Prioritization Meetings in Roxbury and Mattapan to gather inf ormation on the leading health -related issues. iCHNA: At the focus groups, participants were engaged and asked questions regarding their perceptions about the health of the community, community assets, and pressing health issues. Appendix C: Page 20 of 22BILH and other hospital p artners: Focus groups and community meetings were conducted by hospital within the BILH system (i.e., New England Baptist Hospital (NEBH), Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital - Needham, and Lahey Hospital Medical Center) and other hospital partners in Boston as part of hospital CHNA activities . Community and stakeholder p articipants were involved in discussions and engaged to prioritize community health issues. The results of these information gathering and prioritization processes were used to arrive at a set of final community health priorities. Collaborate: To partner with the community in each aspect of the decision including the development of alternatives & identification of the preferred solution Examples: Advisory groups, consensus building, participatory decision making Community Care Alliance (CCA): CCA works in close partnership with a network of private, independent, community health centers in Boston, called the Community Care Alliance. BIDMC created this network and supports their acti vities through technical assistance and direct financial support. BIDMC's Community Benefits Staff oversees the activities of the CCA and, relative to the assessment participated in monthly progress reports to get their input on the assessment and its fin dings. BIDMC CBSA Assessment: The assessment was overseen by a Community Benefits Committee, comprised of community residents and stakeholders. This body collaborated to make decisions regarding the assessment approach and priority health issues BIDMC CHI Engagement: Community residents and stakeholders were included on the CHI Community Advisory Committee. This body was tasked with making decisions regarding engagement approach and strategies, prioritization of issues, and allocation of funds. Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative: The CHNA used a participatory, collaborative approach that engaged the community through different avenues. Over 100 Collaborative members representing health care, public health, education, community development, social servi ce, and community -based organizations provided input throughout the CHNA process and played an integral role in data collection efforts. Data collection efforts were focused on engaging hard -to-reach populations who are not typically engaged in these proce sses or represented in the secondary data. iCHNA: Focus group participants and key informants were identified by the North Suffolk Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment Steering Committee using a segment inclusiveness worksheet to ensure that a vari ety of diverse individuals across multiple sectors and populations were included. Kelina Orlando , Executive Director of BIDMC's Ambulatory Operations was a member of the iCHNA Steering Committee . BILH and other hospital partners: Focus groups and community meetings were conducted as part of hospital CHNA activities, participants were involved in discussions and engaged to prioritize community health issues. The results of these information gathering and prioritization processes were used to arrive at a set of final community health priorities. Specifically, BIDMC and NEBH, along with Boston Children's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Dana -Farber Cancer Institute, jointly hosted a forum in Mission Hill/Roxbury to involve an d collaborate with the community on the identification of priorities. Empower: To place the decision making in the hands of the community Examples: Advisory bodies, volunteer stipends, ballots, delegated decisions BIDMC CHI Engagement: The Community Advisory Committee, made up of community residents and stakeholders, were tasked with making decisions regarding prioritization of issues and allocation of resources. During this process, a series of community engagement meetings were organiz ed with community -based organizations and in a number of cases staff members from these organizations were trained and provided Appendix C: Page 21 of 22stipends to guide discussions in facilitated sessions or \"focus groups\". Their participation enhanced discussions and built th eir capacity. Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative: Community members, residents and service providers, were empowered throughout the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative's activities to participate and in many ways help facilitate and guide discussions. Focus group participants were also provided with stipends and childcare during data collection activities. Additionally, the organizing organizations of each focus group were compensated. Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative also paid the Healthy Community Champions to distribute the community survey. Community Driven/Led: To support the actions of community initiated, driven and/or led processes Examples: Community supported processes, advisory bodies, stipend roles for communities, funding for communities Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative: Focus group participants were provided a stipend and childcare during data collection. Additionally, organizations who hosted the event were compensated. Healthy Community Champions were also provide d a stipend to help distribute the community survey. The Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative also conducted key informant interview and meeting facilitation trainings for representatives from organizations that are part of the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative. iCHNA: Focus group participants were provided a $15 gift card - adults received Market Basket gift cards and youth received Amazon or Target gift cards. BIDMC CHI Community Engagement: CHI efforts included a series of community meetings hosted by communit y-based organizations in BIDMC's CBSA. Host organizations were if they were interested and able to help facilitate breakout sessions at the meetings. Those who agreed to participate were provided a Facilitators Guide and required to participate in a 1 -hour training on facilitation and non -directive interview techniques. Participants were provided a stipend for their participation and assistance in these efforts.

Thes e efforts were done by BIDMC independently , and BIDMC also supported and participated in numerous other CHNA efforts being conducted across Boston and its Community Benefits Service Area (CBSA) . The extensive array of assessment and community engagement activities allowed BIDMC to augment its assessment efforts, better engage the community, and collaborate with key health system partners across the region. A resource inventory was also completed to identify existing health -related assets and service gaps . A Community Benefit s Evaluation was also completed to assess the impact of BIDMC's community benefit s activities since the last CHNA . During th e CHNA process, BIDMC made substantial efforts to engage administrative and clinical staff throughout the Medical Center (including senior leadership) and community health stakeholders throughout the Medical Center's entire CBSA , including the Boston Public Health Commission and other local health departments in in its CBSA . A detailed review of the CHNA approach, da ta collection methods, and community engagement activities are included in Appendix A as well as the body of BIDMC's 2019 CHNA Report. Once BIDMC's CHNA activities were completed, BIDMC's Community Benefits staff convened BIDMC's Community Benefits Committee (CBC) and the BIDMC Community Benefits Senior Leadership Team ( CBSLT) and conducted a series of strategic planning m eetings. These meetings allowed Medical Center staff and a representative group of exte rnal community health stakeholders to review the quantitative and qualitative findings from the CHNA, prioritize the leading community health issues, identify segments of the population most at -risk (Priority Populations), review existing community benefit s programming, and begin to develop BIDMC 's 2020 - 2022 Implementation Strat egy (IS). After these planning meetings, Community Benefits staff continued to work with the CBC and the CB SLT to develop a draft and a final version of BIDMC's 2020 -2022 Implement ation Strategy (IS). Below is a summary of BIDMC's IS. CORE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY PLANNING PR INCIPLES AND STATE P RIORITIES In developing the IS, care was taken to ensure that BIDMC's community health priorities were aligned with the Commonwealth of Mass achusetts priorities set by the Commonwealth's Department of Public Health (MDPH) and the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office ( MA AGO) . The table below outlines the four Community Benefit s focus issues identified by MDPH and the MA AGO . In addition to the four focus issues, MDPH identified six health 1 | P a g epriorities to guide investments funded thr ough Determination of Need p rocess es. The MDPH and the MA AGO encourages hospitals to co nsider these priorities during the community b enefits planning process. Also included below is a brief discussion of a series of guiding principles that informed BIDMC's IS development process. State Community Health Priorities Community Benefits Priorities Determination of Need Priorit y Areas Chronic disease with a Focus on Cancer, Heart Disease, and Diabetes Built Environment Housing Stability/Homelessness Social Environment Mental Illness and Mental Health Housing Substance Use Disorders Violence Education Employment The following are a range of programmatic ideas and principles that are critical to community health improvement and have been applied in the development of the IS provided below. Social Determinants of Health : With respect to community health improvement, especially for low income and disadvantaged populations, the re is growing appreciation for the importance of addressing the underlying social determinants of health. These social determinants have been defined as \"the conditions in which peop le are born, grow, live, work and age that may limit access, lead to poor health outcomes, and are at the heart of health inequities between and within communities .\"1 The leading social determinants of health include issues such as poverty, housing, food a ccess, violence, racism/bigotry, and transportation. It is important that hospital implementation strategies include collabor ative, cross - sector initiatives that address these issues. 1 O. Solar and A. Irwin, World Health Organization, \"A Conceptual Framework for Action on the Social Determinants of Health,\" S ocial Determinants of Health Discussion Paper 2 (Policy and Practice), 2010, available at http://www.who.int/social_ determinants/corner/SDHDP2.pdf. 2| P a g eBeth Israel Dea coness Medical Center August 11 , 2019 Last Revised August 11 , 2019 3 | P a g eHealth Education and Prevention: Primary prevention aims to prevent dise ase or injury before it ever occurs by reducing risks, preventing exposures to hazards , or altering unhealthy behaviors that can lead to disease or injury . Secondary and tertiary prevention aims to reduce the impact of chronic disease or health conditions through early detection as well as behavior change and chronic disease management geared to helping people to manage health conditions, lessen a condition's impact, or slow its progress . Targeted efforts across the continuum to raise awareness about a part icular condition, educate people about risk factors and protective factors, change unhealthy behaviors, and manage illness are critical to improving health status. Screening and Referral : Early identification of those with chronic and complex condition s following by efforts to ensure that those in need of education, further assessment, counseling, and treatment are critical to preventing illness before it takes hold or managing illness so as to lessen or slow its impacts. A critical component of screeni ng and referral efforts is taking steps to ensure that people are fully engaged in treatment, including linkages to a primary care provider. Chronic Disease Management : Learning how to manage an illness or condition, change unhealthy behaviors, and make in formed decisions about your health can help you live a healthier life. Evidence -based chronic disease management or s elf-management education (SME) programs , implemented in community -based setting by clinical and non -clinical organizations, can help people to le arn skills to manage their health condi tions, improve eating and sleeping habits, reduce stress, maintain a healthy lifestyle . Care Coordination and Service Integration : Efforts to coordinate care and integrate services across the health care continu um are critical to community health improvement. These efforts involve bringing together providers and information systems to coordinate health services, patient need s, and information. This helps better achieve the goals of treatment and care. Patient Na vigation and Access to Health Insurance : One of the most significant challenges that people face in caring for themselves or their families across all communities is finding the services they need and navigating the health care system. Having health insur ance that can help people to pay for needed services is a critical fi rst step. The availability of health coverage/i nsurance enrollment support, patient navigation, and resource inventories are important aspects of community health improvement. Cross -Sector Collaboration and Partnership : When it comes to complex social challenges, such as community health improvement, there is a clear consensus that success will only be achieved through collective action, partnership , and collaboration across organizati ons and health - related sectors. No one organization or even type of organization can have a sustained impact on these types of issues on their own. Hospital implementation strategies need to be collaborative and include partnerships with service providers a cross multiple sectors (e.g., health, public health, education, public safety, and community health) .Beth Israel Dea coness Medical Center August 11 , 2019 Last Revised August 11 , 2019 4 | P a g eCOMMUNITY HEALTH PRI ORITY POPULATIONS AN D NEEDS BIDMC is committed to improving the health status and well -being of all residents living throughout its CBSA. However, in recognition of the considerable health disparities that exist in some communities, BIDMC focuses the bulk of its Community Benefits resources on imp roving the health status of low income and underserved populations living in the city of Che lsea and the Boston neighborhoods of Allston/Brighton, Bowdoin/Geneva, Chinatown, Fenway/Kenmore, and Roxbury/Mission Hill. While there are c ertainly segments of the populations in Brookline, Chestnut Hill, Lexington, and Needham that are vulnerable and un derserved , the greatest disparities exist in Chelsea and Boston . In order to maximize the impact of its Community Benefits resources , BIDMC's Community Benefit s Committee (CBC) voted to prioritize and focus BIDMC's attention on the more urban, high -need communities in BIDMC's CBSA. Based on the findings from the breadth of BIDMC's as sessment activities, further efforts were made to prioritize certain population segments by race/ethnicity, socio -economic status, and other factors. More specifically, the Community Benefits Committee (CBC) and the Community Benefits Seni or Leadership Team (CBSLT) voted to prioritize 1) Youth and ado lescents, 2) Older adults, 3) Lo w resource individuals and families, 4) LGBTQ populations, and 5) Racially/ethnically diverse populations, and limited -English speakers. BIDMC's CHN A and strategic planning process provided many opportunities to vet the qu antitative and qualitative data compiled during the assessment. Based on this process, the Medical Center's community benefits staff, the CBC, and the CBSLT identified four community health priority areas, which Youth and AdolescentsOlder AdultsLow Resource Individuals and Families LGBTQRacially and Ethnically Diverse Populations/non - English speakersBeth Israel Dea coness Medical Center August 11 , 2019 Last Revised August 11 , 2019 5 | P a g etogether embody the leading health issues f acing residents living in BIDMC's CBSA . These three strategic domains are: 1) Social Determinants of Health , 2) Chronic/Complex Conditions and Risk Factors, 3) Access to Care, and 4) Behavioral Health ( Mental Health and Substance Use ). Community Health Needs not Prioritized by BIDMC's CBC It is important to note that there are community health needs that were identified by BIDMC's assessment that, due to the limited burden that these issues present and/or the feasibility of having an impact in the short - or long -term on these issues, were n ot prioritized for investment. Namely, transportation and education were identified as community needs but these issues were deemed by the CBC and the CBSLT to be o utside of BIDMC's primary sphere of influence and have opted to allow other s in its CBSA, th e Greater Boston region, and the Commonwealth to focus on these issues. This is not to say that BIDMC will not support efforts in these areas. BIDMC remains open and willing to work with hospitals across Beth Israel Lahey Health's network, with COBTH, and other public and private partners to address these issues, particularly as part of a broad, strong collaborative. The following is BIDMC's Implementation Strategy and provides details on BIDMC's goals, priority populations, objectives, str ategic activit ies, and measures of performance by priority area. Also included , is a listing of the state priorities that align with the activities included in the IS as well as a listing of the core partners that BIDMC has been and will continue to work with to implem ent these activities. With respect to the core community partners listed, this is certainly not a complete list but rather many of its core partners . BIDMC collaborates and partners with dozens of public and private service providers, community -based orga nizations, and advocacy organizations spanning all sectors and CBSA communities. BIDMC is extremely appreciative of the efforts of all of its partners and looks forward to expanding this list as it implements its community be nefits and CHI activities in t he years to come.

These issues influence and define quality of life for many segments of the population in BIDMC's service area . A dominant theme from key informant interviews and community forums was the significant impact that the underlying social determinants, particularly h ousing, poverty, food access, violence, and transportation have on residents in the service area . Resources / Financial Investment: BIDMC will commit direct , community health program investments, and in -kind resources of staff time and materials. BIDMC will also generate leveraged funds through grants from public and private sources on behalf of its own prog rams or services as well as on behalf of its commun ity partners, such as the community health centers that are part of BIDMC's Community Care Alliance.

Roughly 7 in 10 deaths can be attributed to these three conditions. If you include respiratory disease (e.g., asthma, C ongestive heart failure, and COPD) and diabetes, which are in the top 10 leading causes across nearly all geographies than one can account for all but a s mall fraction of causes of death. All of these conditions are generally considered to be chronic and comp lex and can strike early in one's life, quite often ending in premature death. In this category, heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension were thought to be of the highest priority, although cancer was also discussed frequently in the focus groups and fo rums. HIV/AIDS , other sexually transmitted diseases and Hepatitis C were also mentioned in the assessment's interviews and focus groups and should certainly be included in the chronic/complex condition domain. It is also important to note that the risk an d protective factors for nearly all chronic/complex conditions are the same, including tobacco use, lack of physical activity, poor nutrition, obesity, and alcohol use.

This system is expansive and spans the full healthcare continuum, including outreach and screening services, primary care medical and medical specialty care services. There are no absolute gaps in services across the continuum, even for low income and racially/ethnically diverse populations that often struggle with access to health care services. This does not mean, however, that everyone in BIDMC's service area receives the highest quality services when they want it and where they want it. In fact, despite the overall success of the Commonwealth's heath reform ef forts, data captured for this assessment shows that segments of the population, particularly low income , racially/ ethnically diverse populations, and those with limited or no English language skills face significant barriers to care . These segments, and others too, struggle to access services or navigate the health system due to lack of insurance /health coverage , cos t, transportation, cultural/linguistic barriers, the general complexity of the system, and shortages of providers willing to serve Medicaid enrolled or low income, uninsured patients. Resources / Financial Investment: BIDMC will commit direct, community he alth program investments, and in -kind resource s of staff time and materials. BIDMC will also generate leveraged funds through grants from public and private sources on behalf of its own programs or serv ices as well as on behalf of its community partners, s uch as the community health centers that are part of BIDMC's Community Care Alliance.

These issues impact all segments of the population across BIDMC's service area and across all demographic segments. Wit h respect to mental health, a review of the quantitative and qualitative data, highlights the impact of depression, anxiety, and stress as well as bipolar disorder and other serious mental illnesses. With respect to substance use, the data highlights the i mpact of alcohol, opioids, and marijuana. The prevalence, incidence, and service utilization rates (inpatient h ospitalization , emergency department visits, and public program utilization) are higher in a number of communities in BIDMC's service area w hen compared to benchmark data . Large prop ortions of th e population are substantially impacted by mild to moderate mental health and substance use issues such as mild/moderate depression, anxiety and acute stress or alcohol and mar ijuana misuse, while smaller segments struggle acutely with severe mental illnesses or opioid addiction and alcoholism. Stigma and the impacts of racism a nd discrimination have also been shown to play a substantial role with respect to mental illness and substance use disorders and ac cess to preventive, treatment, and recovery services. Trauma is also a major factor with respect to mental health and substance use. Many of those who have experience trauma suff er acutely from formally diagnosed post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), whi le others either have milder, less substantial impacts, or have undiagnosed PTSD. Substance use or misuse is often a byproduct of mental illness. Isolation and depression in older adult segments was br ought up in nearly every discussion that touched on eld er health. Finally, there is a dramatic gap in capacity when it comes to mental health and substance use services, particularly for those who are non -English speakers, low income, Medicaid enrolled , uninsured, or underinsured. Even for those who are insu red and have comprehensive benefits, can find it challenging to find professionals willing to take insurance. As a result, people of ten go without needed care due to linguistic access, cost, and/or provider shortages.

Further complicating the assessment of an MCI is that population -level health behaviors and outcomes take time to achieve. While it may be hard to detect the impact of MCIs on the desired long-term outcomes, it is important to assess whether t he init iative has the attributes known to support and sustain population health in due time. John Snow Inc. (JSI) employed an evidence -informed approach to evaluate the BIDMC CBP . Systematically, JSI scored three attributes found to be predictors of popul ation health \u2014the behavioral intervention, duration, and reach for each activity summarized in the Fiscal Year 2017 Community Benefits Report to the Attorney General (AG Report) . Intention is important because e vidence suggests that w hen an activity improves access, reduces barriers, or changes broader conditions, there is a greater likelihood that individual behavior change will be sustained (compared to sim ply enhancing an individual's knowle dge or skills) .10-12 Reach and duration are significant because r esear ch has found that when more people are exposed to a strategy , and for longer periods of time, there is a greater likelihood that the strategy will support the desired behaviors and o utcomes.10-12 JSI abstracted and scored all a ctivities defined as an action undertaken in accor dance to the community benefits, and reported in the AG Report . An evaluation team member rated each activity attribute as low (0.1), medium (0.55), or high (1.0) , and calculated an intensity score ( behavioral value + duration value + reach value ). Scores could range from 0.3 (lowest intensity and least likely to impact long-term outcomes) t o 3.0 (highest intensity and most likely to impact long -term outcomes ). All activity scores where then summed to create a total composi te score. Findings Among the BIDMC CBP's activities (n=81 ), 23% had a high intention score, 4% wer e scored high in duration, and 4% had a high reach score. The majority of BIDMC CBP activities were of medium intensity in regards to behavioral intervention and duration; they intended to enhance services and occurred more than once (Figure 1 ). Figure 1 . Activity Inten sity Scores by Attribute Appendix G: Page 1 of 5There were five priority areas within which these 81 activities were implemented : 1) Social Determinants of Health (SDH); 2) Access to Care; 3) Physical Health and Chronic Disease Management and Prevention; 4) Behavioral Health and Substance Use; and 5) Equitable Care - Office of Diversity. SDH and Access to Care had the highest number of reported activities (29 and 25, respectively). Although there were slightly more SDH activities compared to Access to Care, the average score w as lower (1.14 vs. 1.43, respectively. This indicates that the activities implemented either aimed to increase awareness/enhance skills, were shorter in duration, and/or reached a smaller percentage of the total population (Table 1). Table 1. Summary of Ac tivities by Priority Area Goal/Priority Area Number of Activities Average Score Total Score Social Determinants of Health 29 1.14 33.00 Access to Care 25 1.43 35.85 Physical Health and Chronic Disease Management and Prevention 17 1.08 18.38 Behavioral Health and Substance Use 8 1.03 8.25 Equitable Care - Office of Diversity 2 0.64 1.28 The co mposite intensity score of the 81 activities was 96.75 ; the lowest possible score for all activities was a 24.3 (if all activities scored a 0.3) and the highest possible intensity score was a 243.0 (if all activities scored a 3.0). Each individual activity score ranged from 0.3 to 2.55; with a 1. 19 average intensi ty score (Figure 2). About half (51%) of the activities had a low score ( 0.3 - 1.1), 47 % had a medium score (1.2 - 2.1), and 2% had a high score (2.2 - 3.0) (Figure 3 ). Figure 2. Individual Activity Figure 3. Percentage of Activities with a Low, Intensity Score Medium, High Intensity Score Appendix G: Page 2 of 5Recommendations Per the requirements of the AG, BIDMC CBP contracted with JSI to evaluate the FY17 CBP. The purpose of the evaluation was t o understand the likely impact of each of the reported activities on long -term behaviors a nd outcomes related to the five priority areas, and to identify opportunities to ensure the CBP supports population health most effectively. Using intention, reach, and duration to score the various activit ies provides a systematic way of assessing the dynam ic and evolving activities implemented as part of the BIDMC CBP . It also provides a platform for documenting progress toward the long -term goal of improved health, and differentiating between activities that may have more or less influence on long - term outcomes. Intensity scores should inform how resources are used most effectively in the future, provide direction for strengthening effort s individually or collectively, and serve as a base line for measuring change overtime. During FY2017, BIDMC CBP activities included a number of activities that, based on the medium intensity scores, have potential to support the desired long-term behavior change s and improved health outcomes. Lower scoring activities: 1) intended to increase awareness and/or educate/enhance the knowledge or skills of individuals, 2) were offered once or a few times (versus ongoing); and 3) reached a small percentage of the population. Adjusting the medium -scoring activities would increase the overall strength and likelihood of impact. For example, BIDMC could take steps to increase the number of people reached/served by a strategy as one approach to increasing intensity. In general, it is recommended that each priority have multiple activities that work simultaneously to increase awareness and improve skills; enhance services; modify access; and change broader conditions for populations of people. CBP staff and partners should assess each activities' contribution to the overall priority area , and use Figure 4 to make modifications to increase the intensity within which all activities are implemented. Finally, in order to fully assess the intensity of future activities, it is important that the purpose, duration, and reach of each activity be documented. Figur e 4.

LIST OF KEY INFORMANT Health EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Background The Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative is a new initiative created by a number of stakeholders \u2014 community organizations, health centers, community development corporations, hospitals , and the Boston Public Health Commission . It aims to undertake the first large -scale collaborative city-wide Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) and Community Health Improvement Planning (CHIP) process. The goals of the CHNA are to: Systematically identify the health -related needs, strengths, and resources of a community to inform future planning , Understand the current health status of Boston overall and its sub -populations within their social context , and Meet regulatory requirements for a number of institutions, organizations, and agencies (e.g., IRS requirements for non -profit hospitals, PHAB for health departments). To support this effort, t he Collaborative hired Health Resources in Action (HRiA), a no n-profit public health organization, as a consultant partner to provide strategic guidance and facilitation of the process, collect and analyze data, and develop the report deliverables. Approach and Methods This CHNA focuses on the social determinants of health using a health equity lens. The influences of race, ethnicity, income, and geography on health patterns are often intertwined. In the United States, social, economic, and political processes ascribe so cial status based on race and ethnicity, which may influence opportunities for educational and occupational advancement and housing options, two factors that profoundly affect health. Institutional racism, economic inequality, discriminatory policies, and historical oppression of specific groups are many of the root factors that drive the health inequities we see in the U.S. today. Social Determinants of Health Framework World Health Organization, Commission on the Social Determinants of Health, Towards a Conceptual Framework for Analysis and Action on the Social Determinants of Health, 2005. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment ii The CHNA used a participatory, collaborative approach that engaged the community through different avenues. Over 100 Collabora tive members representing health care , public health, education, community development, social service, and community -based organizations provided input throughout the CHNA process and played an integral role in data collection efforts. Data collection eff orts were focused on engaging hard -to-reach populations who are not typically engaged in these processes or represented in the secondary data. Existing data were drawn from national, state, and city sources, such as the U.S. Census, Massachusetts Departmen t of Public Health, and Boston Public Health Commission, including datasets such as the Boston Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BBRFSS). For new data collection, over 91 organizations and 2,500 individuals were engaged in a CHNA community survey (N=2,404) administered online and in -person in seven languages, 13 focus groups with community residents (N=104), and 45 interviews with organizational and community leaders to gauge their perceptions of the community's needs, strengths, and opportunities . Like all data gathering efforts, there are limitations to the CHNA data. Secondary data have a time lag, and various sources may use different definitions for similar topics. Data may be aggregated across time, geographies, or population groups to provid e large enough sample sizes. More granular analysis for specific neighborhoods or ethnic groups within larger racial/ethnic categories is not possible. Primary data such as the survey and focus groups use a convenience sample which may not be representativ e of the larger population. Population Characteristics Who lives in Boston? Boston is a young, diverse city that continues to experience population and economic growth that varies by neighborhood and race/ethnicity. Despite an economic upturn in recent years, residents experience disparities in employment and financial security - particularly residents of color and those with lower levels of education - resulting in greater economic inequality. Racial, Ethnic, Cultural, and Language Diversity Understanding the racial, ethnic, cultural and language profiles of Boston helps to provide context for health status and the structural, discriminatory, and social factors that contribute to health inequities. Boston is a diverse city with 23% of residents identifying as Black, nearly 20% identifying as Latino, and nearly 10% identifying as Asian. Boston also has a large immigrant community. One -third of Boston residents speak a language other than English at home, the most prevalent language being Spanish. Diversity among younger residents is greater than among older residents, and population composition by neighborhood varies substantially. Black residents comprise a larger portion of the population in Mattapan , Dorchester, Roxbury, and Hyde Park ; Latino resident s comprise over half the population in East Boston and experienced the largest population growth of all racial and ethnic groups; the South End, Fenway, and Allston/Brighton have the highest proportion o f Asian residents. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment iii Education Education affects health in multiple ways because it increases economic and social resources . Education was seen by Boston CHNA survey respondents as a key component of a healthy community (45% of survey respondents reporte d access to good education as an important factor that defines a healthy community) . While statistics point to a well -educated community (48% of Boston adults have a college degree or more), there are substantial differences across racial and ethnic groups , whereas a higher proportion o f White and Asian adult s have college degrees or more (70% and 57%, respectively), while one in five Black and Latino adult s do. It was noted that current school -age children have multiple needs that affect their educational achievement. Echoing comments shared in focus groups and interviews, data from Boston Public Schools show that over three -quarters of students are deemed high needs (76%) , defined as either being low income, economically disadvantaged, being a current or former English Language Learner, or having a disability. \"Real wages have been going down for low income people [for decades]. This is at the heart of all of it: people have no time because they are working four jobs to get the same salary the y used to get from one [job]. If you can't rest, how can you be healthy? ... Some people have to work 70 hours to make ends meet.\" \u2014 Key informant interviewee Employment and Workforce Employment can confer income, benefits, and economic stability - factors that promote health. Boston, like much of the rest of the nation, has experienced an economic upturn in recent years. In 2018, Boston's unemployment rate was 3.0%, according to the Bu reau of Labor Statistics ; however, when examining unemployment data over the past several years, which can be analyzed by neighborhood and other subgroups , data show that , compared to Boston overall, unemployment rates have been significantly higher in Rox bury, Dorchester, Fenway, and Mattapan , primarily communities of color that experience disproportionate economic challenges. Boston's largest employers are in the health care and education sectors; these sectors have experienced substantial employment gain s over the past 15 years, while manufacturing and utilities have experienced substantial decreases. Focus group participants discussed the challenges of securing a job including the importance and barrier of meeting education requirements/credentials for a new job, job application processes moving online, limited technology skills, and having a criminal record. Income and Financial Security Income is a powerful social determinant of health that influences where people live and their ability to access resour ces which affect s health and well -being. Across all indicators of income and financial security, there are substantial differences across Boston neighborhoods and racial and ethnic groups. The median household income in Boston is $62,021 but ranges from $27,964 in Dorchester to $170,152 in South Boston. In four communities \u2014Dorchester, Fenway, Roxbury and the South End \u2014 approximately 25% -37% of residents live below the federal poverty level . 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment iv Percent Boston CHNA Survey Respondents Reporting Having Trouble with Finances, by Type of Finances, 2019 DATA SOURCE: Boston CHNA Community Survey, 2019 NOTES: Percentage calculations do not include respondents who selected \"don't know/prefer not to answer\" Median household income is highest for White residents ($98 ,317) and lowest for Latino residents ($36,998); median value of total assets and net wealth for White residents far exceeds that for any other racial/ethnic group. Poverty and economic instability were key themes in focus groups and interviews, with parti cipants sharing the challenges of meeting basic needs and the negative effects this has on personal health. As shown in the graph on the right, CHNA survey results indicate that a substantial number of respondents face challenges saving money, paying their mortgages, utility, credit card and medical bills, buying groceries and paying for childcare . These challenges are experienced by a higher proportion of non -White respondents and those without a college degree . Food Insecurity Food insecurity is directly linked to financial insecurity. Being able to afford food for their family was a concern shared by many CHNA participants . According to the BBRFSS, t he proportion of Boston adults experiencing food insecurity has declined from 2010 to 2017 (25% compared to 17%) ; however, food insecurity experiences varied across sub -groups, with Latino (39%) , Black (35%) , and foreign -born (26-27%) more likely to experience food insecurity . \"I'm working three jobs and I can barely afford food; I buy whatever I need to feed my kid and that's it.\" \u2014 Focus (N=1,722) Buying groceries (N=1,832) Paying your monthly utilities (N=1,762) Paying your rent/mortgage (N=1,755) Paying medical bills (N=1,749) Paying for transportation (N=1,836) Paying for medication (N=1,773) Paying for child care (N=1,542) 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment v Social and Physical Environment What is the community context for Boston residents? Boston has several strengths it can leverage to address community health, including proximity t o and abundance of health care services, diversity and multiculturism, a strong network of collaborative social service organizations, and engaged and connected residents. However, Boston's expensive housing market is placing an economic burden on resident s; housing development and the resulting gentrification is changing the social and physical environment - including access to green space and community cohesion - which is disparately affecting seniors, non -English speakers, and residents of certain neighb orhoods. Housing Where people live is integral to their daily lives, health, and well -being. The high and rising cost of housing in Boston was a main theme that emerged in focus group and interview discussions ; these p erceptions are mirrored in the statistics: from 2011 to 2016 , median single - family house prices increased by 48% in Boston overall , according to the U.S. Census American Community Survey . Percent Housing Units Where 30% or More of Income Spent on Monthly Housing Costs by Housing Tenure , by Boston and Race/Ethnicity, 2017 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census, American Community Survey 1 -Year Estimates, 2017 NOTE: Asterisk (*) denotes race/ethnicity estimate was significantly different compared to the Boston estimate (p < 0.05) Focus group and interview participants reported that h ousing costs comprise a large and ever - increasing portion of household budgets , leaving few resources for other needs such as health care, medicine, or nutritious food. The majority of housing units across Boston are r enter - occupied (65%), and renter household s spend an average of $1,445 per month on housing. More than half of those in renter -occupied units are housing cost -burdened , meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing. A significantly higher pro portion of households in East Boston (59%) , Fenway (59%) , Roslindale (62%), and South Boston (60%) are cost - burdened than those in other neighborhoods; additionally, as shown in the graph, Black home owner (48%) and renter household s (59%) are significantl y more likely to spend 30% or more of their income on housing, compared to Boston owner (32%) and renter households (51%) 31.8%37.2%48.2% * 41.2% 25.4% *50.6%58.1%58.6% * Boston Asian WhiteOwner with Mortgage Renter2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment vi overall . Additional pressures include gentrification, long wait lists for housing assistance , overcrowding, poor housing quality, and for some, housing discrimination. In 2018, there were an estimated 6,188 residents counted as experiencing homelessness in Boston , according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Continuums of Care Report. Nearly one-third of homeless h ouseholds included at least one child. Key informants in the field noted that those with mental illness or substance use, LGBTQ youth and seniors, immigrants, those with criminal records, single mothers, and residents who have experienced trauma as being e specially vulnerable to becoming homeless . Transportation Transportation connects people with and between where they live, learn, play, and work. Though many focus group participants perceived improvements in transportation in recent years, others expressed concerns about cost, timeliness, and accessibility of public transportation , especially for the elderly, those with limited English proficiency, and residents of neighborhoods with limited access to transportation. According to the American Community Survey, s lightly over one-third of Boston residents use a personal vehicle to get to work (39%) , and another one-third use public transportation (34%). On average, Bostonians spend abou t 11% of household income on transportation -related expenses , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Focus group participants cited c hallenges with public transit and transportation programs - including reliability, navigating the system, overcrowdin g, and the need to schedule in advance - making it difficult to keep appointments . \"Most [residents] rely on public transportation, and it is difficult when the signs are not in their language. They may not understand announcements about delays or emergencies, and it makes them feel insecure about how to navigate.\" \u2014 Key informant interviewee Green Space and the Built Environment Slightly over 8% of land in Boston is comprised of parks, playgrounds, and athletic fields and about 7% is parkways, res ervations, and beaches. While Boston is considered a very walkable city by national standards , focus group members and interviewees shared that the built environment varies across neighborhoods. Those from Allston/Brighton, Chinatown, and Dorchester percei ved insufficient green space across their neighborhoods, which they attributed to the growth in new housing developments. Social Environment Focus group and interview participants identified examples of strong social networks in Boston, citing cohesion ac ross different immigrant groups and among others who share similar racial, cultural, linguistic and religious backgrounds. Two -thirds of CHNA community survey respondents believed that people in their neighborhoods help each other and three -quarters percei ved that they and their neighbors want the same thing for their neighborhoods. Survey respondents also indicated strong civic engagement, as evidenced by high levels of self -reported involvement in community organizations and voting. At the same time, focu s group participants also mentioned a decline in community social ties, brought on by lack of time and generational differences ; gentrification has likewise changed the \"feel\" of some neighborhoods, specifically Roxbury, East Boston , and Dorchester. CHNA c ommunity survey results and conversations in 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment vii focus groups indicate that subtle and overt discrimination is an issue in Boston, particularly for immigrants and non -English speakers, LGBTQ residents, and older residents and youth, substance users , and the ho meless. \"Regardless of the changing face of the community, there is still a real sense of community here. People looking out for each other... and the amount of services and variety of services is incredible. We hope to keep that richness within the comm unity.\" \u2014 Focus group participant Community Assets Understanding the resources and services available in a community \u2014as well as their distribution \u2014helps to elucidate the assets that can be drawn upon to address community health, as well as any gaps that might exist. Boston has numerous strengths according to focus group participants, interviewees, and CHNA community survey respondents. Neighborhoods were described as being \"tight -knit\" with substantial cultural diversity and strong faith communities. Sixty -eight percent of community survey respondents identified racial and cultural diversity as a top strength of their community. Activism and resiliency are other notable characteristics of Bostonians. Proximity and abundance of health care was also a k ey strength. Across the city, there are 22 hospitals and 33 health center access sites . Community survey respondents identified proximity to medical services as the top strength of their communities, with 69% of respondents identifying this a top strength. Other assets include services and supports for students at Boston Public Schools, and positive strides in the city for LGBTQ residents, including within the school system through Gay Straight Alliances. Finally, the social services network in Boston was p erceived to be large, strong, and collaborative, although some suggested more could be done to enhance cooperation across institutions and reduce duplication. Community Health Issues What is the health status of Boston residents? Health -related concerns that were identified as most pressing among CHNA participants were housing, s ubstance use and mental health , community violence , the environment (including air quality and effects of climate change), and chronic conditions and their related risk factors s uch as obesity. The disparities seen in these issues mirror the historical patterns of structural, economic, and racial inequities experienced for generations across the city and the U.S. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment viii Comm unity Perceptions of Health Percent Boston CHNA Survey Respondents Reporting Top Most Important Concerns in Their Community or Neighborhood That Affect Their Community's Health (N=2,053), 2019 DATA SOURCE: Boston CHNA Community Survey, 2019 NOTE: The figure above only presents the concerns that over 20% of survey respondents selected Understanding residents' perceptions of health is a critical step in the CHNA process, providing insights into lived experiences, including key health concerns and facilitators and barriers to addressing health conditions. As se en in the graph on the right, t he top community health concerns among Boston CHNA survey respondents were housing quality or affordability (51%) and alcohol /drug abuse (49%), followed by mental health (42%) and community violence (31%) ; these were also top concerns by neighborhood, race/ethnicity, age group, gender, and sexual orientation, with the addition of chronic diseases and related behaviors as well as the environment. However, there were some notable differences in responses by race/ethnicity and a ge. Asian respondents were more likely to identify smoking (37%) and elder/aging health issues (32%), Black respondents were more likely to identify diabetes (35%), Latino respondents were more likely to identify obesity (37%), and White respondents were m ore likely to identify the environmental health issues (e.g., air quality, traffic, climate change) (39%) as one of their top five community health concerns . Overall Morbidity and Mortality Cancer (all types combined) and heart disease are the leading cau ses of death in Boston. For cancer, Black (175.3 deaths per 100,000 residents) and White residents (173.1 deaths per 100,000 residents) experience higher rates of death compared to Latino (109.4 deaths per 100,000 residents) and Asian residents (127.0 deat hs per 100,000 residents). Similar racial/ethnic patterns are seen with heart disease mortality. Accidents are the third leading cause of death among all racial/ethnic groups - except for Asian residents, where the third leading cause of death was cerebrov ascular disease (i.e., stroke). In 2016, u nintentional opioid overdoses accounted for 69% of all accidental deaths . Since 2011, the death rate due to accidents has nearly doubled from 28.9 deaths to 54.6 deaths per 100,000 residents in Alcohol/drug abuse Mental health Community violence Environment Obesity Homelessness Smoking Poverty Diabetes Employment/job opportunities Elder/aging health issues2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment ix Cancer, accide nts, and heart disease are also the leading causes of premature mortality (death before age 65); notably, accidents have surpassed heart disease as the second leading cause of premature death.

Concerns related to obesity were frequently discussed among focus group and interview participants . More than half of Boston adults (57%) and one -third of Boston Public high school students (33%) reported being overweight or obese; Black and Latino adults (68% for both groups) and high school students (36% and 37%, respectively) were more likely to be overweight or obese than White adults (51%) or students (23%). The prevalence of obesity and overweight also follows a socioeconomic gradient ; residents who are rente rs, have lower levels of education, and lower income were more likely to be obese or overweight compared to their counterparts . As shown below, a t the neighborhood level, the percent of adults in Mattapan , Hyde Park , Dorchester , West Roxbury, East Boston, and Roslindale who were obese or overweight was significantly higher than the prevalence of obesity for the rest of Boston. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment x Percent Adults Reporting Obesity or Overweight, by Boston and Neighborhood, 2013, 2015, and 2017 Combined DATA SOURCE: Boston P ublic Health Commission, Boston Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2013, 2015, and 2017 combined DATA ANALYSIS: Boston Public Health Commission, Research and Evaluation Office NOTE: Asterisk (*) denotes where neighborhood estimate was significantly different compared to the rest of Boston (p < 0.05); Error bars show 95% confidence interval Focus group and interview participants described healthy eating and physical activity as ways to prevent obesity but cited challenges affording and accessing healthy food and recreational opportunities in their community due to their income and limited community resources. Chronic Disease Although chronic diseases are among the most common and costly health problems, they are also among the most preventable through changes in behavior such as reduced use of tobacco and alcohol and improved diet and physical activity. In 2013 -2017, one -quarter (25%) of Boston adults reported being diagnosed with hypertension, one of the most significant risk factors for heart disease and stroke. However, among focus group and interview participants, d iabetes was frequently mentioned as a community concern that impact s both adults and children , followed by pediatri c asthma. While there is a low prevalence of diabetes and asthma in Boston (9% and 11% respectively), there were significant differences across the population. Black and Latino residents have a higher prevalence of diabetes and experience higher diabetes -related hospitalization and death rates than White residents. Similar to diabetes, there were disparities in the distribution of asthma across the population , including by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and neighborhood . Black and Latino adults and children experience significantly higher asthma -related emergency department visits compared to White adults and children, as seen below in the graph of pediatric asthma emergency department visits. Participants shared that young children living in poverty are disproportional ly affected by pediatric asthma as a result of poor environmental factors and/or poor living conditions including exposure to air pollutants, rodents, mold, and tobacco smoke. Also disproportionately affected by diabetes and asthma are residents of Roxbury and Dorchester, who experience diagnose s and hospitalization s at significantly higher rates than residents in the rest of Boston xi Pediatric Asthma Emergency Department Visit Rate, by Boston and Race/Ethnicity by Age, Age -Specific Rate per 10,000 Residents, 2016 -2017 Combined DATA SOURCE: Massachusetts Center for Health Information and Analysis, Acute Hospital Case Mix Databases, 2016 -2017 Combined DATA ANALYSIS: Boston Public Health Commission, Research and Evaluation Office NOTES: Sample sizes for Asian in the 0 -2 years, 6 -12 years, and 13 -17 years are 20 and rates should be interpreted with caution; Bars with pattern indicate reference group within each age category; Asterisk (*) denotes where estimate was significantly different compared to reference group within each specific age category (p <0.05) Mental Health Mental and physical health are intricately connected , and m ental illness is among one of the leading causes of disability in the United States. Mental health is sues were described as a priority concern across almost all focus group and interviews, and often discussed in connection with trauma. Stress, anxiety, and depression were the most frequently -cited challenges among Boston residents, especially those who identify as LGBTQ, low -income residents, seniors, children, immigrants, and communities of color. Percent Boston Public High School Students Reporting Persistent Sadness, by Boston and Selected Indicators, 2013, 2015, and 2017 Combined DATA SOURCE: Center s for Disease Control and Prevention and Boston Public Schools, Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 2013, 2015, and 2017 combined DATA ANALYSIS: Boston Public Health Commission, Research and Evaluation Office NOTE: Students were asked in the past 12 months if they felt sad or hopeless every day for 2 weeks or more; Bars with pattern indicate reference group for its specific category; Asterisk (*) denotes where estimate was significantly different compared to refere nce group within specific category (p <0.05); Error bars show 95% confidence interval Surveillance and survey data indicate that anxiety and depression are somewhat common across Boston residents, with one in eight Boston adults reporting persistent sadness (12%) and one in five reporting that they felt persistent Male LGBTQ Heterosexual/non-transgender2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment xii Furthermore, the proportion reporting persistent anxiety has increased over time ; a higher proportion of females (24%) , lower stent anxiety than their counterparts . Concern for mental health issues among children and youth w as also a prominent theme in focus groups and interviews and this is validated through quantitative data: as shown on the right, about one -third of Boston pub lic high school students reported feeling persistent sadness ; the rate is even significantly higher among female student s and students who identify as LGBTQ. While statistics indicate that the proportion of people receiving treatment for depression has gro wn, barriers such as stigma, cultural and lingustic differences, and lack of sufficient providers constrain access to services for many. Access to mental health services, especially to providers that understand different cultures and languages, was cited a s a challenge by several interviewee and focus group participants. Substance Use Substance use was considered a priority health issue in many focus group and interview discussions. Participants mentioned a variety of substances including marijuana, prescription drug use, and opioids as being among the most concerning. Co-occurring ment al health and substance use issues were frequently discussed among key informants, as well as the interrelationship between trauma, mental health, and substance use. Smoking among adults and youth, as well as e -cigarette and marijuana use among youth, have significantly decreased in Boston; however, there are significant differences by population groups. Notably, LGBTQ adults and youth are more likely to use tobacco (22% and 12%, respectively), e -cigarettes (18% of LGBTQ and 39%, respectively), compared to heterosexual/non - transgender adults and youth. Approximately one -quarter of Boston adult s reported engaging in binge drinking behavior, although LGBTQ adults were significantly more likely than heterosexual/non -transgender adults (24.0% ) and males (29.8%) were significantly more likely than females (19.8%) to report this. For alcohol -related hospitalizations, White residents had the highest rates of hospital patient encounters for alcohol poisonin g, while Black residents had the highest rates of hospital patient encounters for alcohol dependence/abuse. The rate of opioid overdose deaths in Boston has significantly increased since 2013 and was highest among Latino residents (50.5 deaths per 100,000 residents), followed by White residents (45.1 deaths per 100,000 residents) in 2016. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment xiii Unintentional Opioid Overdose Mortality Rate, by Boston and Race/Ethnicity, Age -Adjusted Rate per 100,000 Residents 12 Years and Over, 2013 -2016 DATA SOURCE: Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Boston resident deaths, 2013 -2016 DATA ANALYSIS: Boston Public Health Commission, Research and Evaluation Office NOTES: Sample size for Black and Latino for 2013 and 2014 are 20 and rates should be interpreted with caution; Data not sho wn for Asian due to insufficient sample size; Dashed line indicates reference group for statistical testing done for 2016 data; Asteris k (*) denotes where estimate was significantly different compared to reference group for 2016 data (p <0.05) ; Change over time was statistically significant for Boston (increase over time), Latino (increase over time), and White (increase over time) The majority of focus group participants and key informants who discussed substance use as a concern identified opioids as a persistent i ssue in Boston . They noted that there were several barriers to treatment and recovery services, including cost, availability of different options, and limited cultural and language competencies of providers to treat immigrant communities. Violence and Tra uma Violence and trauma are important public health issues affecting physical and mental health and were frequent concerns reported by focus group and interview participants . Many focus group participants expressed concern about personal safety in their co mmunities, noting that they saw communities of color and children as being disproportionately affected . 16.721.328.835.4 14.7 12.322.121.1 * 16.6 19.123.450.5 22.031.440.6 45.1 2013 Latino Health Needs Asse ssment xiv Percent Boston CHNA Survey Respondents Reporting Considering Their Neighborhood Unsafe or Extremely Unsafe, by All Respondents and Selected Indicators , 2019 (n=1,920) DATA SOURCE: Boston CHNA Community Survey, 2019 NOTE: Chi -square analyses were conducted and there were statistically significant differences within the following groups (p < 0.05): race/ethnicity, age, gender identity, educational attainment, and parent status Similarly , one quarter of respondents to the CHNA community survey described their neighborhoods as unsafe or extremely unsafe; Black and Latino respondents were more likely than other respondents to describe their communities this way (40% and 37%, respectively). Intimate partner violence was also mentioned in focus groups and interviews, with women of color and non -English speaking immigrants identified as particularly vulnerable populations. Populations varied on their experience of violence overall. According to the BBRFSS, respondents who identified as female, 35 -49 years of age, 50 -65 years of age, residents of the Boston Housing Authority, renters or tenants receiving housing assistance, and LGBTQ - identified r espondents were significantly more likely than their counterparts to report experiencing violence in their lifetime. Exposure of children and youth to unhealthy relationships and violence (adverse childhood experiences) is also of concern: nearly one in five Boston adults (19%) reported experiencing at least one adverse childhood experience such as living with a caregiver with mental health concerns or who was a problem drinker, having parents who were physical violent towards each other, or living with a caregiver who had been in prison. Focus group and interview participants noted that trauma from community violence, poverty, and, more recently, fear of deportation and family separation, are growing issues of or less (N=452) graduate or more (N=831) (N=1,277) LGBTQ (N=228) Parent of child under 18 (N=500) Not parent of child under 18 (N=1,137)2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment xv Maternal and Child Health Quantita tive data indicate that the overall birth rate in Boston has significantly declined for women 15 -44 years old since 2011 to 41.6 births per 1,000 female residents in 2017. However, current birth rates are significantly different by neighborhood compared to the rest of Boston; female residents in Hyde Park, Charlestown, Roslindale, Mattapan, East Boston, Dorchester, and West Roxbury had significantly higher birth rates. Rates of infants with l ow birthweight and preterm births \u2014both important risk factors for infants \u2014are less than 10% and have generally remained steady from 2011 to 2017 ; however, rates for both are significantly higher among Black (13% and 12%, respectively) and Latino mothers (9% and 11%, respectively) . Access to prenatal care has improved ove r time, and currently more than eight in ten mothers in Boston receive adequate or adequate plus prenatal care (83%) . However, Asian, Black, and Latino mothers are significantly less likely than White mothers to receive adequate or adequate plus prenatal c are (84%, 76%, 79%, and 89% respectively) . CHNA participants tended to discuss maternal and child health in the context of economic s and parenting concerns. Childcare was frequently discussed , with expensive or inconvenient childcare, long waitlists, and lack of summer childcare as primary issues . Difficulty paying for childcare was also an issue for respondents to the Boston CHNA community survey (11% of survey respondents reporting having trouble paying for childcare) . \"People are alwa ys working and giving all of their money to child care. I'm working my life away to pay someone else to take care of my children.\" \u2014 Focus group participant Sexual Health Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remain a public health problem in the United States, despite the fact that they are preventable. While sexual health was not a prominent theme discussed across focus groups or interviews; the Youth Risk Behavioral Survey provides helpful insights into sexual behaviors among youth, such as cond om use, to inform STI prevention strategies. This is particularly important given that young adults experienced the highest rates of chlamydia ( 1,737.8 cases per 100,000 residents) . Boston has experienced a significant increase in cases of chlamydia and go norrhea over time with disparities by neighborhood, age, and sex . While the incidence of HIV among Boston residents has decreased over time, disparities persist by neighborhood, race/ethnicity, age, and sex. Environmental Health A healthy environment is important for a high quality of life and good health. Boston CHNA survey respondents cited their top environmental health concerns as: outdoor noise pollution from vehicles, outdoor air pollution from vehicles, and dangerous traffic. Overall, these top three concerns were similar across neighborhoods, except for East Boston which cited airport noise as a top concern. Air pollution and quality was a concern discussed in focus groups in Chinatown and East Boston where residents perceived that lower -income neighborhoods were more vulnerable to pollutants and litt er due to proximity to highways, airports, and train stations. BBRFSS data show secondhand smoke exposure was significantly higher among Boston residents of color and lower socioeconomic status . 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment xvi Multiple key informants explained how more extreme weather, heat, and rising seas from climate change are increasing health problems, particularly for mental health, respiratory, cardiovascular and vector -borne disease. Boston emergency department utilization rates and costs for climate -driven health issues are expected to rise in the future . Community health and resilience efforts can reduce such threats and costs, and help the city prepare for Climate Ready Boston's estimate that 7% of our land will experience frequent storm water flooding by 2050. Health Care A ccess and Utilization Access to comprehensive, quality health care services is important for promoting and maintaining health, preventing and managing disease, and reducing the chance of premature death. Boston is a city with many health care resources and a high proportion of residents have health insurance. Focus group participants, interviewees, and Boston CHNA survey respondents all indicated satisfaction with health care in their community. Residents most commonly obtain health care from a private doct or's office or a public health clinic/community health center, and BBRFSS results show that approximately eight in ten respondents have at least one person as their personal doctor. Percent Boston CHNA Survey Respondents Reporting Factors That Made It Har der for Them to Get Health Care Services They Needed in Past Two Years (N=1,014), 2019 DATA SOURCE: Boston CHNA Community Survey, 2019 NOTE: Data arranged in descending order; Percentage calculations do not include respondents who selected \"prefer not to answer/don't know\" or \"none of the above;\" Respondents were allowed to select multiple response options; therefore, percentages may not su m to 100% According to focus group members, interviewees, and community survey respondents, several barriers to acc essing health care in Boston exist. The most common barriers mentioned by interviewees and focus group participants included underinsurance; language and immigration status; navigation and care coordination an appointment Lack of evening or weekend services Cost of care Lack of transportation Office not accepting new patients Lack of providers who accept my insurance Unfriendly doctors, providers, or office staff Don't have health insurance that covers what I need Don't know what types of services are available Afraid to ask questions or talk to doctors/medical... Afraid if I take the time off to get care, I'll lose my job I have no regular source of health care Felt discriminated against Language problems/could not communicate Instruction/directions are not in my language Health information is not kept confidential2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment xvii sensitive approaches to care. As seen in the graph, for CHNA community survey respondents, long wait times for appointments and lack of evening or weekend services were the top two factors that made it difficult for them to access health care (44% and 38 % of survey respondents, respectively). Cost of care, especially dental care, was also cited as a challenge for some Boston residents. Community's Vision and Opportunities Participants in interview and focus group discussions were asked for their suggestions for addressing identified needs and their vision for the future. Suggestions included the following: Employment and Workforce - Reduce employment barriers by addressing minimum education requirements to be more inclusive of those with valuable l ived experience; subsidizing the cost of childcare so low -income parents can work towards upward mobility through education and job training; and increasing youth employment opportunities . Education - Focus resources on early childhood education; increase social supports in public schools; train educators on trauma -informed approaches to recognize trauma symptoms and respond accordingly; use restorative justice approaches to discipline and behavior issues; and address chronic absenteeism by bolstering wrap around services . Food Insecurity - Increase opportunities to access healthy and affordable food through: urban farming and community gardens; farmer's markets that accept SNAP benefits; and strengthening initiatives that address food access from a clinical perspective, where practitioners can prescribe services and are reimbursed as part of Accountable Care Organizations. Housing - Mitigate the negative impacts of gentrification and displacement by creating more opportunities for home ownership in non -White communities to build generational wealth; and pushing for long -term renewable leases for nonprofits and social services agencies that are being strained by rising operating costs. Further leverage the partnerships between housing and health care for more place -based services. Transportation - Focus on transportation equity in lower income communities that tend to have longer commuting times; reduce traffic by investing in speedy bus lanes; continue making the city more bikeable; and explore fee structures for ride share programs to generate revenue for operational costs at the local level. Chronic Disease - Focus on prevention strategies and chronic disease management \u2014 particularly to prevent diabetes and obesity; and increase more affordable gym and healthy food options . Mental Health - Invest in more mental health supports in public schools; reduce cultural stigma around mental health services, and recruit clinicians who reflect the diversity of Boston . Substance Use - Focus on prevention efforts, especially related to marijuana use and prescription drug use among adolescents. Violence and Trauma - Restor e trust among government, police, and health care institutions by strengthening community linkages and improving community cohesion. Maternal and Child Health - Provide more supports to learn positive parenting skills ; and subsidize the cost of childcare for low -income families, especially for single -headed households. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment xviii Environmental Health - Address environmental health concerns in a systemic way and in partnership across sectors and disciplines, especially as new deve lopments increase across the cit y; and invest in a centralized data repository to track environmental health data . Health Care Access - Increase supports for navigating the complex health system and delivering culturally -sensitive care and linguistically ap propriate services to diverse groups. Greater collaboration and information or data sharing to better serve patients and clients, especially related to the roll out of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) . Pursuing multi -year funding that allow organiza tions to respond to crisis and opportunities, and to build internal and external capacity. Key Themes and Conclusions Overarching themes that emerged from this synthesis that cut across multiple topic areas include the following: Health disparities acro ss most issues show similar patterns by racial/ethnic group and socioeconomic status, and mirror the historical inequities brought about by generations of institutional racism, structural barriers, and discriminatory policies. Whether differences in cancer mortality or asthma prevalence - or unemployment rates and housing instability - similar patterns can be seen in the data, with communities of color, immigrant communities, lower income individuals, and residents of low resourced neighborhoods, among othe rs, experiencing a disproportionate burden across nearly all areas. Although current data sources are not currently designed to be able to examine intersecting identities more deeply, this disproportionate burden is likely even worse when considering inter sectionality \u2014that is, the complex, cumulative way in which the effects of multiple forms of discrimination (such as racism, sexism, and classism) combine, overlap, or intersect, especially in the experiences of marginalized groups. These issues are dynamic ally intertwined and reflect the cumulative and current challenges residents face resulting from historical and structural inequities across multiple systems. With a current population of nearly 670,000 residents, Boston has experienced \u2014and is expected to continue to experience \u2014population growth across every neighborhood in the city, though growth rates across neighborhoods vary. Overall, Boston is a young city, with about one-third of residents under the age of 2 5, that continues to experience population g rowth. The greatest increases in population have occurred in Roxbury, South Boston, Hyde Park, East Boston, and Charlestown. Boston is a richly diverse city in terms of racial, ethnic, and linguistic population groups, though data show this diversity is no t similar across neighborhoods. Boston's large immigrant and non -English speaking communities were identified as facing unique challenges related to social and economic factors as well as navigating the health care system. The wide -ranging diversity of Bos ton residents presents challenges when delivering health and social services that aim to meet the multitude of needs across the city. Additionally, CHNA community survey results and conversations in focus groups indicated that subtle and overt discriminati on is an issue in Boston, particularly for immigrants and non-English speakers, LGBTQ residents, youth and older residents, substance users and the homeless. Although unemployment rates are low and there is economic opportunity for many residents across t he city, there are substantial differences in financial security across neighborhoods and racial and ethnic groups. The median household income in Boston is 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment xix $62,021 but ranges from $27,964 in Dorchester $170,152 in South Boston. In four communities \u2014Dorc hester, Fenway, Roxbury, and the South End \u2014 approximately 25 -37% of residents live below the federal poverty level. Focus group and interview participants discussed the role poverty plays in exacerbating health challenges, particularly among vulnerable gro ups. Quantitative data show that risk -related behaviors and health outcomes generally continue to have inverse relationships with socioeconomic factors. Housing affordability and its implications emerged as a key theme that arose across secondary data, the community survey, and focus groups and interviews. Of all social determinants identified as imperative to health and well -being, housing stability emerged as a top priority among participants. More than half of those in renter -occupied units across the city are housing cost -burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing. Residents frequently discussed issues of gentrification, long wait lists for Section 8 housing, housing discrimination, overcrowding, and poor hou sing quality as consequences of a tight and expensive housing market. The impact of chronic diseases and their risk factors \u2014especially diabetes, obesity, and pediatric asthma \u2014emerged as a priority concern among residents. Residents of color, as well as r esidents who live in Roxbury and Dorchester are disproportionately affected by chronic diseases. Assessment participants frequently discussed a number of social determinants that presented challenges to the prevention and management of these chronic condit ions. In addition to poverty and high housing costs that force individuals to prioritize their spending, a lack of affordable recreational programming and access to nutritious food were described as barriers to health and well -being. Lower income neighborh oods were described as having fewer affordable gyms, grocery stores, and fast food and convenience stores compared to affluent areas. Behavioral health, specifically mental health and substance use among young people are growing concerns among community r esidents; opioids, prescription medication, and marijuana use were reported as most concerning. Co-occurring mental health and substance use issues were frequently discussed, as well as the interrelationship between trauma, mental health, and substance use . Quantitative data show that one in five Boston residents report persistent anxiety and this proportion has increased over time. The rate of opioid overdose deaths in Boston has also significantly increased, particularly among Latinos. Specific population groups are disparately affected by mental health and substance use, especially residents who are younger, LGBTQ, lower income, and of communities of color. Violence -based trauma was identified as a major factor of negative community health outcomes, and there is a need for more trauma -informed approaches to care, particularly for children and communities of color. One in four Boston CHNA community survey respondents described their neighborhoods as unsafe or extremely unsafe, with Black and Latino respondents more likely to describe their communities this way. Apart from community violence and intimate partner violence, assessment participants identified poverty, and more recently, the fear of deportation and family separation, as a growing issue. Exposure of children and youth to unhealthy relationships and violence (adverse childhood experiences) is also of concern: nearly one in five Boston adults reported experiencing one adverse experience over their lifetime. Environmental health risk factors are a particular concern in relation to air quality, effects of climate change, and the built environment. Poor environmental health quality has the greatest impact on low -income communities. Issues such as noise and air pollution 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment xx and dangerous tra ffic were prominent concerns among survey respondents. Indoor air quality is also an issue, and more than one in ten Boston adults on the BBRFSS reported exposure to secondhand smoke, with Asian, Black, and Latino residents all significantly more likely th an White residents to report exposure. The effects of climate change were also noted, with flooding being one of the most significant issues. Boston emergency department utilization rates and costs for climate -driven health issues are expected to rise in t he future . Climate change projections estimate that 7% of Boston's land area could be exposed to frequent stormwater flooding by 2050. Boston has many health care and social service assets that can be leveraged, but access to those services is a challenge for some residents. Proximity of health care services and education institutions, diversity and multiculturalism, and engaged residents were noted as key strengths among Bostonians that can be leveraged in future planning. Barriers to care were multifacet ed and included underinsurance, language and immigration status, navigation and care coordination challenges, transportation, and lack of culturally -sensitive approaches to care. Strengthening partnerships and infrastructure for collaborative data gatherin g and sharing can facilitate greater coordination and identify specific population groups most in need. Undertaking this collaborative CHNA demonstrated that organizations can leverage their strengths and resources for collaborative assessment and planning . However, as extensive as the data gathering was for this effort, it also identified current limitations. Large datasets are not necessarily available on some population groups such as residents who speak specific languages or on particular topics such as child health ages 0 -14 years old. As the Collaborative engages in further planning, there is opportunity ahead to strengthen the relationships, practices, and infrastructure to address these data limitations. In the future, potentially more granular analy ses by neighborhood, topic, or population group can be conducted to help tailor strategies for action. Priorities for Collaborative Action During May -June 2019, an engagement process was undertaken through an online survey, small group discussions with res idents and organizational staff across the city, and a large inclusive prioritization meeting to identify the priorities for collaborative action. The final priorities selected were: Housing (including affordability, quality, homelessness, ownership, gent rification, and displacement) Financial Security and Mobility (including jobs, employment, income, education, and workforce training) Behavioral Health (including mental health and substance use) Accessing Services (including health care, childcare and soc ial services) The cross -cutting and overarching focus of the planning process will be around Achieving Racial and Ethnic Health Equity recognizing that institutional racism and structural inequities are what drive the health disparities we see around race , ethnicity, and language in the city for nearly all issues. From June -September 2019, the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative, in conjunction with key stakeholders and community residents, will develop a community health improvement plan that 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment xxi outlines next steps to address the prioritized health needs from the CHNA. The CHIP development process will commence with a full -day planning session in late June 2019 to develop the initial output for the goals, o bjectives, and strategies within each priority area. Further refinement and development of the CHIP will occur during the summer 2019, with a final CHIP report and Year 1 Action Planning to be completed by September 2019. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 1 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative 2019 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT Background Overview Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative The Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative is a new initiative created by a number of stakeholders \u2014 community organizations, health centers, community development corporations, hospitals , and the Boston Public Health Commission . It aims to undertake the first large -scale collaborative city-wide Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) and Co mmunity Health Improvement Planning (CHIP) process. While community health assessment and planning have been long - standing endeavors among individual organizations across the city , the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative intends to leverage, align , and coordinate efforts and resources across multi - sector stakeholders in Boston . Learn more about the Collaborative at http://www.bostonchna.org/ Prior to launching the first joint community health needs assessment and planning process, the Collaborative undertook an eight -month planning process to define its scope (mission, vision, values, etc.), identify needs for stakeholder representation to out reach to other collaborative partners, define roles and relationships among collaborative partners, establish a recommended governance structure, design an organizational structure, and outline a budget and member contributions. The Collaborative 's vision is a healthy Boston with strong communities, connected residents and organizations, coordinated initiatives, and where every individual has an equitable opportunity to live a healthy life. Our mission is to achieve sustainable positive change in the health of Boston by collaborating with communities, sharing knowledge, aligning resources, and addressing root causes of health inequities. The Collaborative 's goals are to achieve this mission by engaging with the community to: Conduct a joint, participatory co mmunity health needs assessment (CHNA) for Boston every three years discussing the social, economic, and health needs and assets in the community. Develop a collaborative community health improvement plan (CHIP) for Boston to address issues identified as t op priority and identify opportunities for shared investment. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 2 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Implement efforts together where aligned and track individual organizational activities related to those aligned efforts. Monitor and evaluate CHIP strategies for progress and impact to continuo usly inform implementation. Communicate about the process and results to organizational leadership, stakeholders, and the public throughout the assessment, planning, and implementation time period. The work of the Collaborative is guided by the following shared values: Equity Focus on inequities that affect health with an emphasis on race and ethnicity Inclusion Engage diverse communities and respect diverse viewpoints Data driven Be systematic in our process and employ evidence -informed strategies to maximize impact Innovative Implement approaches that embrace continuous improvement, creativity, and change Integrity Carry out our work with transparency, responsibility, and accountability Partnership Build trusting and collaborative relationships between communities and organizations to foster sustainable, community -centered change What is a Community Health Needs Assessment and Community Health Improvement Plan? This report presents findings from the joint Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) , which was conducted September 2018 -June 2019, and will inform discussions and priority areas for the upcoming CHIP. Figure 1 provides an overview of the CHNA -CHIP process. A CHNA identifies health -related needs, strengths, and resources of a community through systematic, comprehensive data collection and analysis . A Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) is the response to needs identified in the CHNA. The CHIP process involves creating a detailed, evidence -based improvement plan to address the prioritized needs of the community . The Boston CHIP , to be completed by September 2019, will be a three -year plan to identify strategies for action, leverage shared resources, and support policy change to improve the health of Boston residents, especially those most in need . 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 3 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Figure 1. Community Health Needs Assessment and Community Health Improvement Plan Process SOURCE: Association for Community Health Improvement, 2017. Community Health Assessment Toolkit. Accessed at www.healthycommunities.org/assesstoolkit Purpose and Scope of the 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment In 2018 -2019 , the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative undertook a city-wide Community Health Needs Assessment to: Systematically identify the health -related needs, strengths, and resources of a community to inform future planning , Understand the current healt h status of Boston overall and its sub -populations within their social context , and Meet regulatory requirements for a number of institutions, organizations, and agencies (e.g., IRS requirements for non -profit hospitals, PHAB for health departments). 2019 Community Health ssment 4 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Defin ition of Community Served The 2019 Boston CHNA focused on the geographic area of the City of Boston (Figure 2). While Boston is a city of neighborhoods, CHNA data are p resented for Boston overall and by different sub-populations where appropriate and available. This includes by neighborhood but also by race/ethnicity, gender, LGBTQ status, income, and other defining characteristics. Figure 2. Ma p of Boston Neighborhoods The map above delineates the neighborhood boundaries used in this report. Neighborhoods can be identified in several ways. In this report, consistent with the Health of Boston 2016 -2017 , zip codes are used to identify neighborhood boundaries since this inf ormation is collected with health data, and it allows us to standardize data to rates using population estimates which can change over time. The zip codes used in this report for identifying neighborhoods are those currently used by the United States Post al Service (USPS). USPS zip codes are not based on geography, demographics, or population size; they are collections of mail delivery routes that are defined at the convenience of the U.S. Postal Service and may change from time to time. Data from the U.S. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 5 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Census Bureau comes in the form of Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs), generalized areal representations of USPS zip code service areas. ZCTA is a trademark of the U.S. Census Bureau whereas ZIP Code is a trademark of the U.S. Postal Service. With this app roach, some neighborhoods are combined to provide a larger area for analysis. Please note that the zip code neighborhood definitions used in this report may differ from those used by other organizations and agencies. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 6 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative METHODS The following section details h ow data for the CHNA were compiled and analyzed, as well as the broader lens used to guide this process. Social Determinants of Health Framework Upstream Approaches to Health Having a healthy population is about more than delivering quality health care to residents. Where a person lives, learns, works, and play s all have an enormous impact on health. Health is not only affected by people's genes and lifestyle behaviors, but by upstream factors such as employment status , quality of housing stoc k, and economic policies. Figure 3 provides a visual representation of these relationships, demonstrating how individual lifestyle factors, which are closest to health o utcomes, are influenced by more upstream factors such as employment status and educational opportunities . Figure 3. Social Determinants of Health Framework SOURCE: World Health Organization, Commission on the Social Determinants of Health, Towards a Conceptual Framework for Analysis and Action on the Social Determinants of Health, 2005. The data to which we have access is often a snapshot in time, but the people represented by that data have lived their lives in ways that are con strained and enabled by economic circumstances, social context, and government policies . To this end, much of this report is dedicated to discussing the social, economic, and community context in which Boston residents live. Throughout the report, there ar e descriptions at the beginning of each section discussing why these issues are important and how they affect health (entitled \"Why is This Important?\"). As such, we hope to understand the current health status of Boston residents and the multitude of fac tors that influence health to enable the identification of priorities for community health planning, existing strengths and assets upon which to build, and areas for further collaboration and coordination. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 7 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Health Equity Lens When compared to many cities a cross the country, Boston is a healthy city, with numerous successes to celebrate. However, this is not uniformly the case for all neighborhoods or population groups in Boston, and specific groups consistently experience poor health outcomes. Barriers to t he opportunities to live a healthy life may be disproportionately concentrated among certain populations, such as communities of color, low -income populations, homeless persons, persons with disabilities, and the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender , and qu eer (LGBT Q) community. The influences of race, ethnicity, income, and geography on health patterns are often intertwined. In the United States, social, economic, and political processes ascribe social status based on race and ethnicity, which may influen ce opportunities for educational and occupational advancement and housing options, two factors that profoundly affect health. Institutional racism, economic inequality, discriminatory policies, and historical oppression of specific groups are a few of the factors that drive health inequities in the U.S. In the present report, we describe health patterns for Boston overall and areas of need for particular population groups. Understanding factors that contribute to health patterns for these populations ca n facilitate the identification of data -informed and evidence -based strategies to provide all residents with the opportunity to live a healthy life. Approach and Community Engagement Process Collaborative and Work Group Structure The CHNA aimed to engag e agencies, organizations, and residents in Boston through different avenues . As described below, the Collaborative's structure provided the guiding decision - making framework for this work. Steering C ommittee Comprises of 19 members representing hospital s, health centers, Boston Public Health Commission, a public health organization focused on community, community development corporations, and community representatives. Its role is to provide strategic direction and oversight of the process (See APPENDIX A for list of Steering Committee members). Operations Committee Comprises of Steering Committee co -chairs and the Collaborative's Coordinator. This Committee resolves operational issues requiring immediate actions. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 8 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Work groups Comprises of general membership. The two Work Groups for the CHNA were open to anyone who was interested in being involved. They provided input and assistanc e on implementing activities. For the Boston CHNA, these two Work Groups were: Secondary Data Work Group Secondary Data Work Group - included 32 members representing a range of organizations, including hospitals, health centers, local public health, and community -based organizations, among others. The Work Group's charge is to provide guidance on secondary da ta approach and indicators and foster connections with key networks and groups to provide relevant data (See APPENDIX B for list of members). Community Engagement Work Group included 54 members representing a range of organizations, including hospitals, health centers, local public health, education, community development, social services, and community -based organizations, among others. The Work Group's charge is to provide guidance on the approach to community engagement, input on primary data collections methods, and support with logistics for primary data co llection (See APPENDIX B for list of members). General Membership Attends events, shares information, and participates in work groups. The Collaborative hired Health Resources in Action (HRiA), a non -profit public health organization, as a consultant partner to provide strategic guidance and facilitation of the proces s, collect and analyze data, and develop the report deliverables. Work Groups, Engagement , and Outreach As noted, two work groups \u2014the Community Engagement Work Group and Secondary Data Work Group \u2014provided input and support throughout the CHNA process. The Community Engagement group identified the g oals of the community engagement process as 1) to ensure that diverse community voices are represented throughout the CHNA -CHIP process; and 2) to involve community members and stakeholders in the dev elopment and implementation of the CHNA - CHIP process to achieve shared ownership of the process and product. During the CHNA process, the Community Engagement Work Group was instrumental in developing the goals and methods for the primary data and the comm unity engagement approach for the CHNA, identifying topics to explore for data collection and population groups that were highest priority, reaching out to community groups and residents for engagement, providing feedback on the survey instrument and focus group and interview guides, and pilot - testing the survey instrument. Members met seven times in a series of virtual and in -person meetings over eight months and were also engaged by email and telephone between meetings to provide feedback throughout the p rocess. In addition to providing guidance and input on methods , members played an integral role in data collection efforts. Work group members volunteered to conduct interviews, recruit for focus groups, facilitate focus groups, promote surveys through so cial media and their networks, and administer surveys to respondents . As part of this effort, orientation sessions were offered to work group member volunteers to provide an overview of data collection protocols, including logistics, roles, and best practi ces. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 9 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative The Secondary Data Work Group members identified the goals of the secondary data as: 1 ) to examine inequities by population group: by race/ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status (SES), etc.; 2) to provide a baseline for comm unity health level data to track over time; and 3) to present trends to identify emerging issues or whether there have been changes over time for issues of concern. The Secondary Data Work group approach to the secondary data focused on diving delve deeply into topic areas identified from previous assessments and frame the discussion around the social determinants of health. The Secondary Data Work Group was instrumental in developing and providing feedback on list of data indicators, identifying potential data sources, and making connections to those sources. Members met six times in a series of virtual and in -person meetings over eight months and were also engaged by email and telephone between meetings to provide feedback throughout the process. The Sec ondary Data Work Group and Community Engagement Work Group met collaboratively in October 2018 to ensure alignment across methods, and again in late April 2019 for a large -group synthesis of preliminary data. This April 2019 three -hour \"Data Day\" meeting p rovided an opportunity to reflect on preliminary data by topic area and collaboratively interpret preliminary data in the form of data placements to inform the draft CHNA report. Methods: Review of Existing Secondary Data Secondary data are data that have already been collected for another purpose. Examining secondary data helps us to understand trends, provide a baseline, and identify differences by sub-groups. It also helps in guiding where primary data collection can dive deeper or fill i n gaps. While the secondary data for this CHNA cover a wide range of issues, there is a particular focus to dive more deeply into areas already identified in previous assessments (e.g., housing, transportation, income, employment, education, mental health, substance, chronic conditions and their risk factors, violence and trauma, and access to services) as well as frame the discussion comprehensively around the social determinants of health. Data Sources Secondary data for this CHNA were from a variety o f sources, including the Boston Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BBRFSS) , Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) , U.S. Census American Community Survey (ACS) , vital records, Acute Hospital Case Mix Database from the Center for Health Information and Analysis, and a number of other agencies and organizations. Please see Appendix C for more technical notes about the most frequently common datasets cited in this report. Analyses All secondary data on birth and death records, BBRFSS, YRBS, and Acute Hos pital Case Mix were analyzed by the Research and Evaluation Office of the Boston Public Health Commission. Other data were analyzed by the organizations cited in the data source. Analyses are presented as frequencies (percentages) and rates throughout the report. Data from the ACS and surveillance systems, such as the BBRFSS and YRBS, are presented with confidence intervals (or error bars in the figures), where possible. When statistical significance testing was conducted, it is noted in figures or in text . Specifically, when the word \"significantly\" is used in the text it 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 10 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative connotes statistical significance (p<0.05). Additional information on confidence intervals and significance testing can be found in the Reporting Notes in this section. Limitations Each data source for the secondary data has its own set of limitations. Overall, for the data in this report it should be noted that d ifferent data sources use different ways of measuring similar variables (e.g., different questions to identify race/ethnicity; different boundaries for neighborhoods). There may be a time lag for many data sources from the time of data collection to data availability. Some data are not available by specific population groups or at a more granular geographic level due to small sub -sample sizes. In some cases, data from multiple years may have been aggregated to allow for data estimates at a more granular level or among specific groups. It should also be noted that for the datasets used, it is not always possible to examine data in a more granular way. For example, data are examined by race/ethnicity and by neighborhood, but the sample sizes are not large enough to look at data by race/ethnicity within neighborhood in many cases. Additionally, while data are examined by major catego ries of races and ethnicities (e.g., White, Black, Latino, Asian), it is not possible for many of these data sources to examine data of sub -population groups within these categories (e.g., Chinese descent, Vietnamese descent). Please contact the Boston Pub lic Health Commission Research and Evaluation Office for further consideration of custom health data analysis of specific Boston resident sub -population groups. Methods: Primary Data Collection Primary data are new data collected specifically for the pur pose of the CHNA. Goals of the Boston CHNA primary data were: 1) to delve deeply into people's perceptions, lived experiences, challenges, and facilitators around certain issues; and 2) to fill in gaps on specific topic areas or population groups where lim ited data were available. Primary data were collected using three different methods for the Boston CHNA: a community survey, focus groups, and key informant interviews. Boston CHNA Community Survey A community survey was developed and administered over six weeks in February -March 2019. The survey focused on a range issues related to the social determinants of health, community perceptions, and access to care and was developed with extensive input from the Community Engagement Work Group and guided by exi sting validated questions from the field or used in other studies . The survey was pilot -tested in late January 2019, and the final instrument was launched in February 1, 2019 with wider dissemination starting the following week . The survey was administered on-line and via hard copy in seven languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Haitian Creole, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Arabic). Extensive outreach was conducted by Collaborative members to disseminate the survey via social media, institutional e -newsletters , e-mails to large networks, waiting rooms, 13 Boston Public Library neighborhood branches, community events, and large apartment buildings. Over 35 organizations assisted with survey dissemination ( See APPENDIX D for list of organizations). Additionally, Healthy Community Champions (an initiative of grassroots ambassadors) conducted targeted survey administration in specific neighborhoods. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 11 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative The final sample of the C HNA Community Survey comprises 2,404 respondents who were Boston residents. Table 1 provides the breakdown of those respondents by self-identified neighborhood of residence and compares the percent distribution of that neighborhood in Boston. Table 1. Boston CHNA Survey Respondents Distribution by Neighborhood Compared to % of Population in Boston Neighborhood # of Survey Respondents (N=2,404) % of Survey Respondents % of Population in Boston Allston/Brighton 243 10.1% 9.5% Back Bay 36 80 3.3% 8.2% Mattapan 102 120 West West Roxbury 97 4.0% 4.3% DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census, American Community Survey, 5 -Year Estimates, 2013 -2017 NOTE: For ACS data, neighborhoods were defined by Boston Public Health Commission using ZCTAs; Back Bay includes Back Bay, Beacon Hill, Downtown, North End, and West End; South End includes South End and Chinatown; Roxbury includes Roxbury and Mission Hil l Additional data on survey respondent characteristics such as age, educ ation, primary language, gender identity, and other demographic characteristics can be found in APPENDIX E . Analyses Frequencies were calculated for each survey ques tion. Not all respondents answered every question; therefore, denominators in analyses reflect the number of total responses for each question and varied by question. Additionally, denominators excluded respondents who selected \"prefer not to answer/don't know.\" For questions that allowed for multiple responses 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 12 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative (i.e., questions that asked respondents to check all that apply), the denominator was out of the total number of respondents who selected at least one response option for the question. Stratified analyses were conducted for select questions by specific sub-groups that had large enough sample sizes. Responses by neighborhood are presented for neighborhoods that had 100 or more respondents to the survey. Chinatown respondents (n=71) were also included i n neighborhood -level analyses because secondary data combine Chinatown and South End together in analyses, and thus neighborhood -specific data for Chinatown are not found elsewhere. Sub-group analyses by primary language spoken are also presented in the re port; these sub -groups represent respondents who either completed the survey in the specific language or indicated on the survey that it was a primary language that they spoke at home. Limitations While strong efforts were made to conduct outreach across t he City with a deeper dive within neighborhoods and population groups who experience disproportionate health burden, the community survey used a convenience sample. Because a convenience sample is a type of non - probability sampling, there is potential sele ction bias in who participated or was asked to participate in the survey. Due to this, results cannot necessarily be generalized to the larger population. Additionally, some sub -group analyses consist of very small sub -sample sizes, these sub-group analyse s are still presented in the report for population groups where data are limited from other sources (e.g., Haitian Creole speakers, non -binary and transgender individuals, etc.); however, given the small sub -sample sizes and convenience sampling methodolog y, results should be interpreted with caution. Focus Groups and Key Informant Interviews Focus Groups Thirteen focus groups were conducted with specific populations of interest: 12 focus groups conducted specifically for the collaborative CHNA and one additional focus group conducted by work group members who submitted notes for the CHNA. Focus groups were 90 -minute semi - structured conversations with approximately 8 -12 participants per group and aimed to delve deeply into community's needs, strengths, a nd opportunities for the future. Focus groups were conducted with the following population groups, including residents of specific neighborhoods : Female low -wage workers (e.g. housekeepers, child care workers, hotel service workers, etc.) Male low -wage wo rkers (e.g. janitorial staff, construction, etc.) Seniors (ages 65+) with complex, challenging issues (e.g. homebound, medical complications) Residents who are housing insecure (no permanent address or close to eviction) Latino residents in East Boston (in Spanish) LGBTQ youth and young adults at risk of being homeless Immigrant parents of school age children (5 -18 years) Survivors of violenc e; mothers who have been impacted by violence Parents who live in public housing in Dorchester Chinese residents living in Chinatown (in Chinese) Haitian residents living in Mattapan (in Haitian Creole) Residents in active substance use recovery Additio nal focus group with notes provided: Chinese residents living in Chinatown 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 13 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative A total of 104 community residents participated in focus groups, representing 1 3 neighborhoods across the city. Nearly half of focus group participants identified as Black or Africa n American (45%), a third of participants identified as Hispanic or Latino (34%), and 10% identified as White. The majority of participants identified as female (57%), 36% identified as male, and 7% identified as transgender or genderqueer. Additional data on focus group participant characteristics can be found in Appendix F. Fifteen community and social service organizations located throughout Boston assisted with recruiting participants and/or hosting focus groups (See APPENDIX G for list of organizations). Key Informant Interviews A total of 4 5 key informant interviews were completed, six of which were additional interviews submitted by work group volunteers. Interviews were 45-60-minute semi -structured discussions that engaged institutional, organizational, and community leaders and front -line staff across sectors. Discussions explored interviewees' experiences of addressing community needs and opp ortunities for future alignment, coordination, and expansion of services, initiatives, and policies. Sectors represented in these interviews included: public health, health care, housing and homelessness, transportation, community development, faith, educa tion, public safety, environmental justice, government, workforce development, social services, food insecurity, business organizational staff that work with specific population such as youth, seniors, disabled, LGBTQ, and immigrants. See APPENDIX H for a list of key informant interviewees. Analyses The collected qualitative information was coded using NVivo qualitative data analysis software and then analyzed thematically by data analys ts for main categories and sub -themes. Analysts identified key themes that emerged across all groups and interviews as well as the unique issues that were noted for specific populations. Throughout the qualitative findings included in this report , the term \"participants\" is used to refer to focus group and key informant interview participants. Unique issues that emerged among a group of participants are specified as such (e.g., Spanish -speaking focus group participants, etc.). Frequency and intensity of dis cussions on a specific topic were key indicators used for extracting main themes. While neighborhood differences are noted where appropriate, analyses emphasized findings common across Boston. Selected paraphrased quotes \u2014without personal identifying inform ation \u2014are presented in the narrative of this report to further illustrate points within topic areas. Limitations There were multiple moderators for the focus groups \u2014particularly for non -English language groups \u2014and interviews were conducted by both HRiA and work group members. Therefore, there is likely variation in how interview and focus group protocols were interpreted and implemented . Focus groups also ranged in size and varied in group dynamics. Additionally, while focus groups and interviews provide va luable insights and important in -depth context, due to their small sample size and non -random sampling methods, results are not necessarily generalizable. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 14 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Reporting Notes Confidence Intervals For Boston Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey data, whi ch represents a sample of residents, many graphs provide 95% confidence intervals to give a sense of how accurate the result is considered as a measurement for the entire population (i.e., how much sampling error exists for a given percentage or point esti mate). Smaller confidence intervals indicate less sampling error and greater data precision than larger confidence intervals. Error bars are used in the graphs to show the confidence intervals , indicating the range in which we believe the true value of the population lies. Testing for Significant Difference Tests for statistical significance were conducted to compare different data points by sub -groups or over time. The tests for statistical s ignificance were conducted either against a reference group (e.g., Asian, Latino, and Black residents compared to White residents), against the Boston average or for a neighborhood against the rest of Boston (Boston overall minus the population of that spe cific neighborhood), comparing the difference in distribution of responses to question categories among sup -populations, or examining differences in time points. If there is a statistically significant difference between groups or data points, where the p <0.05, then this indicates that there is less than a 5% chance that there is no difference between the data points, providing stronger evidence that any differences we see are not just due to chance. In this report, tests for significance are noted in t he table or graph notes, while the narrative uses the words \"significant\" or \"significantly\" to note where there are statistically significant differences when testing has been completed. Terminology Numerous terms are used throughout the report for different population groups. For race/ethnicity, the terms White, Black, Latino, and Asian are used for brevity in graphs and narrative. Since Latino is considered an ethnicity, when the terms White, Black, and Asian are used, this indicates residents identifying as White, Black, or Asian who do not also identify as Latino. For the terms used for different racial/ethnic groups, Asian refers to individuals in the data that , if asked for more specific designat ions, self-identified as Asian Indian, Cambodian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese or of other Asian descent. Black refers to individuals in the data that self -identified as African American, Barbadian, Cape Verdean, Ethiopian, Haitian, Jama ican, Nigerian, Somali , or other sub -Saharan African descent . Latino refers to individuals in the data that self -identified as Mexican or Mexican American, Salvadoran, Puerto Rican, Dominican, Cuban, Colombian, Guatemalan, Honduran , or other Central or Sou th American descent. White refers to individuals in the data that self -identified as European, Middle Eastern, or North African descent. The term LGBTQ is used in the report to refer to individuals that self-identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgende r, or queer. Asse ssment 15 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS - WHO LIVES IN BOSTON? Population Overview Why is This Important? The population profile of a community, including density, patterns of growth and age distribution, are important factors that inform our understanding of a community's health and health care needs. A neighborhood in which many aging baby boomers reside, for example, will have different health challenges and needs than one populated predominantly by college students or young families. Key F indings in This Section With a current population of nearly 670,000 residents, Boston has experienced \u2014and is expected to continue to experience \u2014population growth. Growth rates across neighborhoods vary. Roxbury, South Boston, Hyde Park, East Boston, and Ch arlestown, for example, have all experienced double digit increases in population over the past five years, while Fenway and the South End have seen far more modest growth. Overall, the city is a young one, with about one- third of residents under age 24. T here is substantial variation in age profiles across neighborhoods however: Dorchester, Hyde Park, Mattapan, and Roslindale have the highest proportion of residents under age 18 , while Back Bay and West Roxbury have the highest proportion over age 65. Pop ulation Count and Characteristics The most current figures from the 2013 -2017 American Community Survey show that Boston has 669,158 residents ( Table 2), a population t hat has grown 8% in the last several years. According to the Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA), Boston's population is projected to continually grow at that rate \u2014to 723,500 people by 2030.1 In the last several years, the population of the city has increased in all neighborhoods. While the population increase citywide has been about 8%, population increases in Roxbury, South Boston, Hyde Park East Boston, and Charlestown were more than double digits, ranging from almost 11% - 17%, from 2008 -2012 t o 2013 -2017.

Fenway has a smaller percentage of children, but nearly six in ten of its population is 18 -24 years old. West Roxbury is the neighborhood with largest distribution of older residents 65+ years old at 18.7%.

The United States is becoming increasingly diverse racially and ethnically. The nation is projected to become a \"minority -majority\" society by 2043, one in which White (non -Latino) residents will be the largest racial and ethnic group, but will constitute less than half of the population.2 At the same time, disparities in health and health care access across different racial and ethnic groups are persistent challenges. People of color experie nce poorer health outcomes and greater barriers to accessing health care compared to whites and have lower utilization of health care resources.3 Understanding the racial, ethnic, cultural and language profiles of Boston residents helps to provide context to data about health status and the structural, discriminatory, and social factors that contribute to health Jamaica Plain Mattapan Roslindale Roxbury South Boston South End West RoxburyUnder 18-24 years 25-44 years 45-64 years 18 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Key Findings in This Section Boston is a diverse city with 23% of residents identifying as Black, nearly 20% identifying as Latino, an d nearly 10% identifying as Asian. Boston has a large immigrant community, with most immigrants in the city having been born in the Caribbean or Asia. One-third of residents speak a language other than English at home, the most prevalent language being Spa nish. Diversity among younger residents is greater than among older residents, and at the neighborhood level, diversity varies substantially. Black residents comprise a larger portion of the population in Roxbury, Hyde Park, and Dorchester and Mattapan , while Latino resident s comprise over half the population of East Boston; the South End, Fenway, and Allston/Brighton have the highest proportion of Asian residents in the city. Between 2012 and 2017, Latino resident s experienced the largest population growth of all racial and ethnic groups. Boston Language Diversity Nearly 4 in 10 Boston residents speak a language other than English at home. Racial and Ethnic Composition Focus group and interview participants engaged in the assessment described their communities as richly diverse, mentioning wide racial, cultural, and linguistic diversity. As one key informant interviewee noted, \"Multiculturalism is one of Boston's strengths; it facilitates connections and bridges gaps in an organic way.\" Focus group participants, particularly those from non -English groups \u2014identified diversity as a strength of their communities, but also noted that new communities faced barriers with social and economic factors as well as navigating the health care system. These themes are discussed at greater length in other sections of this report. Multiculturalism is one of Boston's strengths; it facilitates connections and bridges gaps in an organic way. \u2014 From a key informant interviewee Data show that Boston is a diverse city, but population composition by race and ethnicity varies by neighborhoods ( Table 3). While more than one in five Boston residents (22.7%) identify as Black , in neighborhoods such as Roxbury, Hyde Park, and Dorchester the percentage is 40 -50%, while Black residents comprise 77.2% of the population of Mattapan. Nearly 20% of the Boston population identifies as Latino, yet 57.4% of East Boston's population and 27.3% of Roxbury's population is Latino. Additionally, while Boston's overall population increased by 8% in the last several years, Latino residents experienced a growth of 20.1% (See APPENDIX I for data over time). Asian residents are nearly 10% of Boston's population, but 23% of the population in the South End (which also includes Chinatown here), and approximately 18% of both Fenwa y and Allston/Brighton's populations. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 19 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Table 3.

Nearly 38% of residents speak a language other than English at home ( Figure 5), and those figures are significantly higher for East Boston, Dorchester (zip codes 02121, 02125), Roxbury, Hyde Park, and the South End (which includes Chinatown) compared to Boston overall. Given this diversity, many indicators from the Boston CHNA survey are provided later in this report by primary language spoken. Boston's language diversity was considered a major strength of the city, according to focus group participants, especially those who were non -English speakers. Severa l participants discussed belonging to \"tight -knit\" cultural groups where residents could speak freely in their native language. For example, one focus group participant from Chinatown shared, \" There are many Chinese speaking residents [in Chinatown], and i t's easy for someone who mainly speaks Chinese to live here.\" Similarly, in East Boston, one participant expressed, \"There are a lot of Latinos that speak Spanish here and I'm grateful that they can help me navigate services.\" Non-English focus group parti cipants reported that for the most part, they were able to access some community resources in their native language; however, they also reported experiencing much longer wait times for these services. One resident explained, \" I do not speak English, so I [ usually] wait 1 -2 hours for any social services.\" Figure 5.

Immigration Key informant interviewees and focus group participants described a robust immigrant community in Boston. Shared c ultural beliefs and values such as hard work and devotion to one's family were described as strengths of these communities by participants . For example, immigrant residents from Mattapan shared, \" Haitians work hard and are very active; our community gives a great contribution in the work force and professional. They move the economy forward and are trust worthy.\" Interviewees noted that immigrants also face substantial challenges in accessing various system s in the U.S. due to language and c ultural differences. Health care and social service p roviders shared that the diversity of immigrant and refugee groups in the community creates challenges for services to reach everyone effectively. Further, s everal focus group participants also noted th at the city is home to a number of undocumented residents; undocumented residents were described as facing substantial barriers to accessing health and other services, and were particularly vulnerable in the current political 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 22 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative climate. One key informant sha red, \" With immigration policy , [residents] worry that applying for government benefits will impact their legal status. Some people are not willing to apply anymore.\" One focus group participant who identified as undocumented described obstacles in almost every facet of her life, sharing, \" People like me can't get things like cable or anything that gives you a better quality of life because I don't have a social security. If you don't have a social security, you can't access anything ; I don't even trust ban ks, so I don't have any accounts .\" As focus group and interview participants noted, Boston's immigrant community is strong. While over 28% of Boston residents were born outside the United States, that figure is significantly higher in neighborhoods such as East Boston, Dorchester, and Mattapan ( Figure 6). Those born outside the United States were most likely to come from the Caribbean (29.1% of foreign -born residents) and Asia (26.0% of foreign -born residents) (See APPENDIX I for additional data).

Data indicate that 14.5% of Boston residents are naturalized residents, while 9.0% are documented foreign -born residents and 5.5% are undocume nted foreign -born residents (See APPENDIX I ). In qualitative discussions, participants mentioned the need for outreach and services to undocumented residents. The Mayor's Office for Immigrant Advancement (MOIA) provides pro -bono immigration advice clinics to residents of Boston. Between 2015 and 2017, there were a total of 1,356 clinics held, with about 19 attendees per clinic. Of these clinics, nearl y half of the cases (48%) have focused on family -based immigration issues, by the far the biggest focus area of the clinics (See APPENDIX Educa tion Why is This Important? Education affects health in multiple ways. Individuals of lower educational attainment generally have less favorable health profiles compared to their counterparts with greater educational attainment.4 Most directly, education increases economic and social resources. 5 Those with higher levels of education are less likely to experience unemployment and economic hardship and have more social connections than those with lower levels. Those with lower levels of education are more likely to be engaged in jobs that are lower paying or unstable, lack employer -provided health insurance benefits, or that are more risky or unsafe. Research has also found that adults with higher educational levels have higher le vels of health literacy, causing them to better comprehend medical instructions, understand medications, and advocate for themselves with health providers than their counterparts with lower educational attainment.6 Inequities in educational funding and unequal access to key educational resources, including skilled teachers and quality curriculum, are concentrated in low -income communities and communities of color and are interconnected with the unequitable and discriminatory housing and neighborhood polices these same communities experience.7 Key Findings in This Section Education was viewed by Boston CHNA survey respondents as a key component of a healthy community. While statistics point to a well -educated community (nearly half of Boston adults have a college degree or more), there are substantial differences across racial and ethnic group s, with a high proportion of White and Asian adults with college degrees or more and far fewer Black and Latino adult s. Over a quarter of Latino adults in Boston do not have a high school diploma. Echoing comments shared in focus groups and interviews, dat a from the Boston Public Schools show that over three -quarters of students are deemed high needs, defined as either being low income, economically disadvantaged, being a current or former English Language Learner, or having a disability. Differences in edu cational quality and resources across Boston neighborhoods was an issue raised by many focus group participants and interviewees , and were concerns within the same communities experiencing economic, housing, and employment challenges as well. \"When it c omes to kids in elementary [school], one of the bigger challenges becomes feeling like you have to luck out to get into a good school. It's a lottery, and if you're able to tour and make informed choices you are not guaranteed a slot at the school. The old er the children get, the more challenging it is finding quality education in the city.\" \u2014 Key informant interviewee Educational Attainment Among residents engaged in CHNA data collection, education was an important factor to them. As discussed later in this report, when Boston CHNA Survey respondents were asked what defines a \"healthy community\", education was the most fifth most cited factor in a list of 20 provided with 45% it as an important defining characteristic of their ideal healthy community. Similarly, focus group participants connected educational attainment with health outcomes in their communities and perceived that increasing opp ortunities for educational achievement 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 24 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative ultimately leads to healthier communities. A few key informants described education in Boston as a strength, mentioning a rich history of public education and increased efforts for structural commitments to support st udent's social -emotional needs. Overall, Boston is a highly educated city with nearly half of adults (48.2%) ages 25 years old or older holding a college degree or more. However, there are stark differences by race/ethnicity and by neighborhood. Nearly s even in ten White residents hold a college degree, while only two in ten Black and Latino residents do ( Figure 7). Nearly six in ten Asian residents hold a college degre e. With 26.1%, Latino adult residents are most likely to not have a high school diploma. Only 4% of White adult residents do not hold a high school diploma, while the figure is 18% among Asian adult residents and 15% among Black residents. By neighborhood, East Boston, Roxbury, Dorchester, and the South End have a significantly greater proportion of residents who do not have a high school diploma compared to Boston overall ( Figure 8). Data on other educational attainment categories by neighborhood can be found in APPENDIX I . Figure 7.

Children with special needs, undocumented students, and those who have experienced trauma were identified as groups that needed more support in and outside of the classroom. For example, parents in Chinatown discussed challenges receiving adequate special education resources. One shar ed, \" My kid needs speech therapy; he's getting one hour per week with the speech therapist and I requested increased services but was denied. I wish the school provided more resources for special education.\" When discussing strategies to address trauma, on e key informant shared, \" We need early interventions that have wrap around service models; we need individual counseling, family therapy, a parent advocate...we need interventions at multiple levels.\" As such, the student population in Boston Public Schools is diverse in their needs. Figure 9 shows that 32 .1% of BPS students are considered English Language Learners, defined as a student whose first language is a language o ther than English and who is unable to perform ordinary classroom work in English , 20.3% are students with disabilities, and 56.5% are considered economically disadvantaged. Altogether, 76.2% of BPS students are deemed high needs, as either being low incom e, economically disadvantaged, being a current or former English Language Learner, or having a disability.

Key informant interviewees in the field discussed how chronic absenteeism is of particular concern among children from families who are homeless or with parents who have substance use disorders or co -occurring mental health issues. One interviewee sh ared, \" Kids are missing a lot of academic time and school days because they are placed in shelters and then transported somewhere else; kids are sometimes commuting an hour and a half each way to school ...\" Interviewees indicated that children who have experienced trauma are more likely to miss school or become disengaged when they are in school. There were suggestions for more trainings that focus on trauma -informed approaches to teaching. \"Being trauma -informed in education means knowing what to look for [trauma symptoms] and being able to respond accordingly. Because your response as a provider or a teacher can either make or break how kids are engaged in services.\" \u2014 Key informant interviewee Figure 10 presents data from BPS on students who are chronically absent.

Students can be counted in more than one group Educational quality was brought up among many focus group and interview participants and discussed within the frame of educational equity. Participants believed that students in lower income neighborhoods were not necessarily receiving the same quality education as those in more affluent neighborhoods within Boston. Parents in focus groups in Allston/Brighton and in Dorchester held the perception that public schools did not invest in schoo ls equitably across neighborhoods. One Allston parent shared, \" I want better education for my daughter. The scores at our schools are very low compared to other neighborhoods .\" Some parents discussed lottery systems that made it challenging to access neigh borhood schools that were perceived to be of higher caliber. One key informant explained, \"When it comes to kids in elementary [school] , one of the bigger challenges becomes feeling like you have to luck out to get into a good school. It's a lottery, and if you're able to tour and make informed choices you are not guaranteed a slot at the school. The older the children get, the more challenging it is finding quality education in the city.\" Key informant interviewees who work with families or who were in the educational field expressed the need for smaller class sizes, more social emotional supports, teachers that reflect the diversity of the community, and more venues to discuss health and wellness. One key informant summarized, \" We need to increase teachers and counselors and decrease class sizes. There is an opportunity to formalize more social support positions within Boston Public Schools to address [child] mental health on an on -going basis.\" In addition, several discussed the importance of early childhood education and supports.

Americans spend more than half their waking lives at work.8 Employment can confer income, benefits, and economic stability, among other factors t hat promote health. Well -paying jobs enable workers to live in healthier neighborhoods, afford nutritious food, and pay health care - related expenses. 9 By contrast, unemployment, underemployment, and job instability not only make it more difficult to purc hase goods and services that enhance health, but also have been shown to contribute to stress -related health conditions and poorer mental health.10 \"I've struggled to get a job. I have more than a decade of experience, but the minimum requirements are a lways a bachelor's degree, so that disqualifies you for ten jobs right off the bat.\" \u2014 From a focus group participant Key Findings in this Section Boston, like much of the rest of the nation, has experienced an economic upturn in recent years. In 2018, Boston's unemployment rate was 3.0%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, when examining unemployment data over the past several year s, which can be analyzed by neighborhood and other subgroups , data show that unemployment rates have been significantly higher in Roxbury, Dorchester, Fenway, and Mattapan compared to Boston overall. In focus groups and interviews, those with lower educati on or fewer skills (especially in technology), immigrants, and those with a criminal record additionally were reported to experience employment challenges. Boston's largest employers are in the health care and education sectors; these sectors have experien ced substantial employment gains over the past 15 years, while manufacturing and utilities have experienced decreases. Numerous Boston CHNA survey respondents reported feeling underemployed, wanting higher pay, or desiring greater job satisfaction. Focus g roup members and interviewees described challenges in getting a secure job, specifically around meeting educational credential requirements, navigating online job application systems, and dealing with CORI criminal background checks. Employment Rate and I ndustry Overall, Boston residents have been experiencing low levels of unemployment in the last several years. However, i n focus group and interview discussions, there were differing views about employment and economic prospects in the city of Boston. Se veral key informant interviewees talked about the economic vitality in the city, citing a strong local economy and thriving small businesses. However, many residents across several focus groups discussed the challenges for workers, especially those with lo wer educational levels or skills, in securing well-paying jobs, remarking on the stark divides in class between Boston residents. One interviewee shared, \"We have become the two cities of Boston. The extreme and stark difference is right in your face; wher e you have urban affluence right up against urban poverty... the Ritz condo development right next to St. Francis House...\" Several focus group participants from 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 30 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Dorchester, East Chinatown, and Allston/Brighton described working multiple low -wage jobs and the stressors that come from a lack of job security. One Dorchester resident shared, \"I have three jobs and still make less than $45,000 a year, barely getting by.\" Immigrant communities, single -parent households, residents with a criminal re cord, and parents of children with special needs were described as especially vulnerable to unstable employment situations. In 2018, Boston had an unemployment rate of 3.0% according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). However, 2018 BLS data are not able to be examined by different neighborhoods or population groups. Data from the 2013 -2017 aggregated American Community Survey from the U.S. Census shows that 7.3% of Boston residents were not employed over this five -year period, yet that figure wa s significantly higher for the neighborhoods of Roxbury, Dorchester, Fenway, and Mattapan ( Figure 12). Additional unemployment data by race/ethnicity can be found in APPENDIX I . Figure 12.

The top five largest employers in the city are Massachusetts Gener al Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston Public Schools, Boston University, and Boston Children's Hospital. This mirrors the industries in which Boston residents are employed. According to the American Community Survey, nearly one -third of Boston residents 16 years or older are employed in education, health care, or social assistance industries ( Figure 13). The next most common Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative industry for Boston residents is professional, scientific, and management; administrative, and waste management services (industry categories are pre -defined by the U.S. Census).

Business services jobs are concentrated in Back Bay, Downtown, and the South Boston Waterfront. Education and health care jobs are concentrated in Roxbury, Fenway/Kenmore, Back Bay, and the West End. Employment Challenges and Satisfa ction Two main themes emerged from the data collection with Boston residents: employment satisfaction and challenges in securing a competitive job. Numerous Boston CHNA Community Survey respondents reported feeling underemployed, wanting higher pay, or des iring greater job satisfaction.

Of the 978 CHNA survey respondents who answered that they were looking for a new job, the most commonly cited reason for looking was higher pay (33.4% ) followed by job satisfaction (21.3%), and more opportunities for advancement (11.2%) ( Figure 14). Figure 14. Percent Boston CHNA Survey Respondents Looking for New Job Reporting Primary Reason for Looking for a New Job (N=978), 2019 DATA SOURCE: Boston CHNA Community Survey, 2019 NOTES: Data arranged in descending order; Percentage calculations exclude respondents who selected \"not looki ng for a new job\" Focus group participants, however, were more likely to discuss the challenges of securing a job rather than job satisfaction itself. These challenges, discussed in more detail below, included meeting educational requirements, changing hir ing processes, having appropriate technology skills, and having a criminal record. Educational Requirements and Training Many focus group participants discussed how formal educational requirements for a job are a significant initial barrier. As one residen t from Dorchester summarized, \"I've struggled to get a job. I have more than a decade of experience, but the minimum requirements are always a bachelor's degree, so that disqualifies you for ten jobs right off the bat.\" Several participants also remarked t hat many employers do not take into account work or life experience as comparable to educational requirements. As one example focus group participant shared, \"In Boston, just having the credentials they want is difficult. You may have half of the education credentials, 10 years of work experience, and lots of life experience, but they [employers] don't see [the work or life experience as comparable].\" Several participants discussed how the high cost of college and other educational opportunities was inacces sible to them, especially if they were working, single parents. One focus group participant explained, \"People want to enrich their lives and get an education but how can you without support? Single parents don't know what to do with their kids, how to get to work; how are we ever supposed to satisfaction More opportunities for advancement Other More flexible schedule Better hours Closer to home Better training and educational opportunities Want more hours/full-time position Better benefits Want a permanent position2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 33 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative In addition to access to degree programs or positions that recognized life and work experience, focus group and interview participants identified the need for more trade schools and job centers that can help residents gain skills and training to create pathways beyond entry -level positions. Focus group participants from the South End specifically mentioned carpentry, electrical work, machine training, and small business training as especially valuabl e. Participants also stressed that it is imperative that training opportunities are accessible to working parents, taking in to consideration issues like childcare, time, and cost. One interviewee summarized, \"There's a need for employers that are sensitiv e to single -headed households who can help provide more work -life balance.\" Hiring Processes and Navigating Technology Challenges navigating technology and dealing with new hiring processes were also identified as a concern for residents in Dorchester and among senior focus group participants. For example, focus group participants in Dorchester explained that the hiring process has drastically changed over the last 10 years in that nearly all applications are now submitted online. One participant shared, \" It's hard to get job now because everything is online. When you do the online application, you're trying to answer the question to the best of your ability, but you have to think outside the box because we are written off so quickly. There're no more walk -in interviews where you can meet someone and give a good first impression. \" Another participant agreed and added, \"I'm a wonderful person if I could just get in the door.\" Participants in these groups explained that there are many incorrect assumptions abo ut residents' ability to navigate technology. One Dorchester parent resident shared, \" Not everybody is computer literate. Not everyone has a resume online and that really knocks you down. You just want someone to see that you're a good person and hard work er, but you can't do that because there's no face to face correspondence anymore.\" Similarly, focus group participants who were seniors explained that technology is often a hinderance to remaining competitive in the work force. One shared, \"A lot of elderl y do not how to use their cellphone properly. Some classes have been given to help seniors with technology. There needs to be more of that because many of us have the phone but don't know how to use it.\" Criminal Record Having a criminal record also makes it difficult to secure employment, shared focus group and interview participants. Focus group participants who identified as homeless described challenges finding employment because of past criminal charges. One shared, \"You need to remember that CORI1 is going to limit you in everything ...even if you get it sealed . [Employers] say they'll get back to you and call you, but they never do. \" Key informants described the need for more support from employers for this population. One interviewee explained, \" [There is] a need for more flexible employment policies so that people who have criminal records can have real opportunities to work and turn their lives around. When they are closed off from these positive opportunities, that is when they go further downhill in destructive behaviors.\" 1 CORI stands for Criminal Offender Record Information and is a record of all criminal court appearances in Massachusetts for a particular individual, including arrests, convictions, dismissals, and serious violations. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 34 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Youth Employment Challenges Focus group participants, especially parents, also discussed the importance of encouraging youth employment, both for young people to learn important skills and to focus their time on positive activities. However, while there are a number of youth workforce programs in the city, many youth s find it challenging to get a job. When talking about the limited number of employment opportunities for young people, one parent from Dorchester shared, \"You need to know somebody who knows somebody just for a kid to get a job. Then they have to resort to the streets because they don't have [anything] else to do.\" Key informant interviewees explained that it is imperative that thes e opportunities include a focus on technology and \"21st century skills\" like computer programming, professional communication, and critical thinking. One interviewee shared, \"We [in Boston] are one of the leading markets for technology -enabled industries, and we have young people who do not have access to computer and internet service in their homes. They do everything on their phones but that does not help them fully participate in the economy.\" Further, it was noted that transportation poses a challenge f or young people to access employment opportunities, so it is important that jobs are available within their communities or can offset transportation barriers. One interviewee shared, \"Transportation is a major issue that impacts our work. The amount of tim e it takes to get anywhere does not help kids with after school jobs. Kids ride two buses and a train and then walk for a 2 -hour employment experience!\" Income and Financial Security Why is This Important? Income is a powerful social determinant of hea lth. At an individual level, income influences where people live, their ability to access higher education and skills training, and their access to resources to help them cope with stressors, all of which affect health and well -being. Income also shapes a ccess to health -promoting resources such as healthy food, health care, and technological advances (e.g., new medical treatments).13 Compared to their higher income counterparts, low -income individuals have higher rates of smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity; more limited access to healthy foods, opportunities for physical activity, and healthy environments; higher rates of physi cal limitations, heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and other chronic conditions; and more limited access to health care.14 At a community level, regardless of individual level of income, low community wealth often correlates with more limited educational an d job opportunities, greater community violence, environmental pollution and disinvestment in essential infrastructure and resources.15 While income, education, and employment are all associated with health outcomes in slightly different ways, many of the same population groups \u2014communities of color, women, immigrants, and others \u2014experience the compounded challenges and structural inequities across the myriad of systems related to economic advancement and upward mobility. The city median household income is $62,021 but ranges by neighborhood -from Dorchester with the lowest median income at $27,964 to South Boston with the highest at $170,152. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 35 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Key Findings in this Section Across all indicators of income and financial security, there are substantial differ ences across Boston neighborhoods and racial and ethnic groups , that are similarly patterned as other social, economic, and health inequities . The median household income in Boston is $62,021, but the spread between the community with the lowest median hou sehold income (Dorchester, $27,964) and the highest (South Boston, $170,152) is substantial. In four communities \u2014 Dorchester, Fenway, Roxbury and the South End \u2014approximately 25 -35% of residents live below the federal poverty level. Median household income i s highest for White resident s and lowest for Latino resident s. Median value of total assets and net wealth for White residents far exceeds that for any other racial/ethnic group. Poverty and economic instability were key themes in focus groups and intervie ws, with participants sharing the challenges of meeting basic needs and the negative effects this has on personal health. Community survey results indicate that a substantial number of respondents face challenges paying their mortgages, utility, credit car d and medical bills, buying groceries , and paying for childcare . These challenges are experienced by a higher proportion of non -White respondents compared to White respondents, and those without a college degree compared to those who do have a college degr ee or more. Household Income and Poverty Financial insecurity was reported as a concern in the majority of focus groups and interviews, with participants indicating that it was one of the root causes of stress in their lives, and reporting challenges meeting basic needs such as food, shelter, and medical care. Focus group participants across geographies often attributed these financial stressors to stagnant salaries, higher costs of living, and difficulty balancing multiple low -wage jobs. One interviewee summarized, \" Real wages have been going down for low income peo ple [for decades]. This is at the heart of all of it: people have no time because they are working four jobs to get the same salary they used to get from one [job]. If you can't rest, how can you be healthy? The sleep and the downtime are fundamental, an d people have less of it. Some people have to work 70 hours to make ends meet.\" Census estimates reflect this theme of the burden of limited income affecting many households across Boston. In 2013 -2017, one -quarter of Boston households had incomes <$25,000 (27%) and one in seven households earned between $25,000 and <$50,000 (16%), an d yet one -third of Boston households earned $100,000 or more (Figure 15). The neighborhoods of Allston/Brighton and East Boston most closely resembled the socioeconomic profile across Boston. Roxbury (44%), Fenway (40%), Dorchester (02121, 02125; 36%), and the South End (31%) had the highest proportion of households with incomes below $25,000. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 36 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Figure 15.

These numbers should be close if there is not much variation or unequal extremes in a group. While the average (or mean) of a s etting is often examined, the median provides the mid -point, where 50% of the sample is above that number and 50% is below. Figure 16 represents on the map those neighb orhoods whose median income was significantly lower (light blue) or significantly higher (dark blue) than Boston overall. More detailed data on the specific median and average incomes by neighborhood can be found in APPENDIX I . These data indicate that the average household income was highest in Back Bay (02110; $256,500) and South Boston (02210; $212,297) in 2013 -2017. The 02121 neighborhood in Dorchester had the lowest average ($45,874) and median ($27,964) household income over this period, with the average household income in Dorchester being 82% lower than that in Back Bay. The 02119 and 02120 neighborhoods in Roxbury both were among the lowest average ($49,233 and $51,456) and median ($30,663 and $32,243) household incomes, respectively.

White households ($98,317) Median household income for Boston overall was $62,021 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 38 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative reported incomes that were 47% higher than the city average ($66,758). Asian ($47,048), Black ($39,344), and Latino ($36,998) households earned significantly less than the average across Boston. Notably, while White households r eported incomes that were approximately $30,000 above the city average, Latino and Black households brought home incomes that were $30,000 below the median income across Boston.

The federal poverty line changes by housing size; for a household of one, the 2019 federal pover ty line is an annual income of $12,490; for a household of four, it is $25,750. Figure 18 indicates that one in five Boston residents (20.5%) meet this criterion for th e 2013 -2017 aggregate American Community Survey data, although this situation varies by neighborhoods. The percent of residents living below the federal poverty level was highest in Fenway (36.7%) and Roxbury (34.4%) in 2013 -2017, followed by and the South End (24.6%). West Roxbury (6.4%) had the lowest proportion of residents living below the federal poverty level in 2013 - 2017. The percentage of the population living in poverty also differs significantly by race/ethnicity . Using just 2017 data, Asian residents, at nearly 31%, and Latino residents, at nearly 28%, are significantly more likely to be in poverty than Boston residents overall. White residents are significantly less likely, at nearly 11% ( Figure 19). $66,758$47,048 *$39,344 *$36,998 *$98,317 * Black Latino Needs Asse ssment 39 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Figure 18.

Data on Boston families living below the federal poverty line can be found in APPENDIX I . Given Boston's high cost of living, looking at data on those who are right above the poverty line is also important. APPENDIX I also includes data on individuals with incomes at 200% below the poverty line by neigh borhood. Income Inequality and the Wealth Gap Income inequality of a community is expected to have direct effects on an individual's own income status, as well as indirect effects that can affect health, regardless of one's own income status. Studies have discussed that increases in income inequality could affect the availability of goods and services, the enforcement of laws banning unsafe consumer products, the benefits and costs of higher education, the social bonds among relatives and neighbors, or 10.9% * Boston Asian Black Latino White2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 40 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative distribution of political influence16. The Gini Index is a common measure used to identify the level of income inequality in a given population, ranging from 0 (generally reflecting income equality) to 1 (generally indicating highest levels of income inequa lity). As shown in Figure 20, the Gini Index ranged from a low of 0.42 (02210 zip code in South Boston and 02163 zip code in Allston/Brighton) to a high of 0.67 (02111 zip code in the South End). Income inequality was also higher in Back Bay (02110; 0.64) and Fenway (02115 and 02215 zip codes; 0.60 -0.61). See APPENDIX I for additional detail. Figure 20. Gini Index, by Zip Code, 2013 -2017 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2013 -2017 NOTE: The Gini Index is a summary measure of income inequality. The Gini coefficient incorporates the detailed shares data into a single statistic, which summarizes the dispersion of income across the entire income distribution. The Gini coefficient ranges from 0, indicating perfect equality (where everyone receives an equal sh are), to 1, perfect inequality (where only one recipient or group of recipients receives all the income). The Gini is based on the difference between the Lorenz curve (the observed cumulative income distri bution) and the notion of a perfectly equal income distribution ; \"Lower than Boston overall\" indicates the estimate is significantly lower than the Boston estimate; \"Similar to Boston overall\" indicates the estimate is statistically similar to the Boston estimate (i.e., no statistically significant differe nce); \"Higher than Boston overall\" indicates the estimate is significantly higher than the Boston estimate Gini index for Boston overall was 0.5425 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 41 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Numerous participants across focus groups perce ived that there is growing economic inequality in communities of color compared to their White counter parts. People noted the gentrification of neighborhoods and rising cost of living was having a disproportionate impact on lower income families and communities of color. As one key informant interviewee described , \"A lot of our minority families in Roxbury and Dorchester can never make it into the middle class. Our families are being pushed out to cities like Brockton and Randolph and then aren't able to access city resources.\" Data on wealth were not available for the City of Boston, but studies have look ed at the wealth of the Boston Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) which is comprised of Massachusetts Counties of Norfolk County, Plymouth County, Suffolk County, Middlesex County, Essex County and New Hampshire Counties of Rockingham County, NH and Straf ford County, NH. In a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston 2015 report which focused on examining wealth disparities between residents who identify as White, U.S. born Black, Caribbean Black, Cape Verdean, Puerto Rican, and Dominican, the median value of total assets for White residents in the Boston Metropolitan Statistical Area ($2 56,500) far exceeded the assets reported for any racial/ethnic minority group in 2014 (Figure 21). Among residents of color , the highest household assets were reported among non -Caribbean Hispanic residents ($15,000), followed by residents who identified as Caribbean Black ($12,000). Of note, Cape Verdean ($0) and Black/African American residents ($700) had the lowest reported household as sets in 2014. Data on net worth, which can be found in APPENDIX I , show similar patterns. These patterns reflect themes in focus groups and intervie ws suggesting that residents of color across Boston are struggling to make ends meet, let alone get ahead financially. Figure 21.

Participants talked about the challenges of making ends meet. As one participant noted, \"Even if rent goes up $50 or $100 a month , it's a lot when your income is not growing.\" In particular, participants talked about challenges with being stuck in low-wage jobs , with little room for advancement, and how that made it difficult to maintain a good quality of life. For example, in East B oston and Dorchester, parents spoke of working hourly wage jobs that were inconsistent and unstable. One resident from Dorchester illustrated her challenge in being in a low wage job without much autonomy or flexibility in schedule , \"I'm a single mother an d told my jobs that I can't work night shifts when I applied. But still they schedule me for hours I can't do and then they can fire you if you don't make the shifts. They pick and choose whatever hours they want to give you.\" A few focus group participan ts who identified as low -wage mentioned that raising the minimum wage in Massachusetts is a step in the right direction to financial stability; however, more is needed to help working poor and lower middle -class families. Across most groups, participants spoke of having to live paycheck to paycheck and being unable to save any additional income for emergencies. One low -income parent shared, \" There are lots of financial needs here in East Boston. People are working 2 or 3 jobs, and even if you live simply, your salary breaks even. There is no extra money.\" Residents who are in the lower middle class also described struggles to maintaining financial stability, mentioning limited resources to help families attain upward mobility. One focus group participant from the South End shared, \"People working are making too much to get food stamps \u2014but not enough to feed their family. The middle class is struggling; you're back to surviving and not living.\" According to key informants and non -English focus group participants, residents who were undocumented and new immigrants were especially vulnerable to financial instability between no documentation, limited power, and the desire to support their families in their country of birth. One undocumented residen t shared, \" The problem is that people have social security numbers - lots of people who don't have papers. And [employers] can pay you very little because they know you can't report them. I get paid $40 a day to work very long days and take care of someone else's kids.\" A focus group participant in Mattapan echoed this sentiment, sharing, \"We are unable to support each other, and we should be trying to invest in ourselves, but we still need to send transfer money to Haiti [every month].\" \"Families who are lower middle income are trying to get out of the grey area but are stuck. If they get a raise and advance, then they don't qualify for services.\" \u2014Key informant interviewee \u2014 From a key informant interviewee Multiple focus group participants also described what is known as 'the cliff effect' - when a minor increase in income can cause a swift and total loss of benefits that are often more than the financial raise. One interviewee explained, \"One big obstacle for those we serve is the cliff effect. A s [residents] start to increase their income, their benefits drop off. Navigating that is a challenge and there's a real fear around that.\" Focus group residents who identified as low - income echoed this sentiment, with some describing experiences of losing health insurance or other benefits as a result of picking up even a few extra hours of work a week. One Mattapan resident shared, \"I got 4 extra hours at my job and MassHealth cut me off and I couldn't afford 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 43 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative my pills for weeks after that.\" Loss of benefi ts was also a concern as it related to childcare, with one interview sharing: \" Parents who need to work in order to provide for their families is often a hard choice for mothers who need to ask themselves' do I stay home and stay on the benefits I'm receiv ing, or do I find childcare, so I can work?\" This sentiment was echoed by focus group participants who were mothers, with one sharing, \" I get paid $40 a day and the YMCA charges me $60 a day for childcare. It's impossible for a single mom like me to pay th at.\" These forms of financial insecurity that emerged in focus groups and interviews echo estimates from the Federal Reserve indicating neighborhood variation in delinquent payments and poor credit scores. Approximately one in five residents in Roxbury (22 %), Mattapan (21%), and Dorchester (18%) were delinquent in a payment in 2017, similar to the average across Boston (19%) that same year ( Figure 22). (It should be note d that the neighborhood definitions used for the Federal Reserve study are slightly different than the definitions used throughout the rest of this report.) Figure 22.

Food insecurity \u2014not having reliable access to a sufficient qua ntity of affordable, nutritious food\u2014is directly related to financial insecurity. Few Americans meet nutritional guidelines, as indicated by daily consumption of fruit and vegetables.17 Inadequate financial resources and limited access to healthy, affordable food contribute to these patterns.18,19 Food insecurity has substantial negative effects on health: research has shown that people experiencing food insecurity have lower nutritional intakes, increased rates of mental health problems and depression, higher rates of diabetes and hypertension, and worse oral health.20 \"I'm working three jobs and I can barely afford food; I buy whatever I need to feed my kid and that's it.\" \u2014 From a key informant interviewee Key Findings in This Section The expense and accessibility of healthy food was a key area of concern shared by focus group participants and interviewees. While more affluent neighborhoods were described as having substantial acce ss to healthy food, lower income neighborhoods , most commonly communities of color, were described as having few grocery stores and a prevalence of fast food and convenience stores. The proportion of Boston adults experiencing food insecurity has declined from 2010 to 2017; however, 17% of residents still experience Food Housing Transportation Medications Utility Bills Education Childcare Job search or training Translation/interpretation Care for elder or disabled Legal Issues Immigration issues 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 47 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative and foreign -born residents are far more likely to report being food insecure than White or U.S. - born residents. Nearly 20% of Boston residents receive benefits fr om the Supplementation Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). In focus groups, f ood assistance programs were described as filling a critical gap for those facing difficulty accessing food . Enhancing food access through expansion of community gardens, food pr escription programs, and hours and selections at food pantries was suggested. Experiences with Food Insecurity Key informant interviews and low -income focus group participants across neighborhoods discussed the challenge of not having enough money to affo rd food. As one focus group participant remarked, \"I'm working three jobs and I can barely afford food; I buy whatever I need to feed my kid and that's it.\" While housing might be the largest cost to a family's budget in Boston, the cost of food was stil l challenging for many. As one key informant explained, \"A lot of people spend money on food after utilities and health care; whatever is left goes to food.\" Focus group participants echoed this sentiment and described having to eat canned or processed foo d that contain high levels of sodium and low -nutritional value because they felt like that was what they could afford. Focus group and interview participants identified seniors and children as being especially vulnerable to being food insecure. Key inform ants who worked with seniors described mobility and mental health issues that compounded challenges for them to access healthy food. One key informant shared, \" Many seniors are homebound and food delivery is one of their only contacts with the outside worl d.\" Those who worked with children explained that food insecurity impacts a child's stress levels, ability to pay attention at school, lower test scores, and absences. Quantitative data indicate that over one in five Boston residents reported being food insecure, in that it was sometimes or often true that the food they have purchased did not last and they did not have money to get more. Experiences with food insecurity varied by population group (Figure 27). In aggregated 2013, 2015, and 2017 BBRFSS data, Latino (39.1%) and Black (34.5%) residents were significantly more likely than White residents (10.7%) to report bei ng food insecure as were foreign -born residents compared to U.S. born residents. Food insecurity data by neighborhood, which can be found in APPENDIX I , indicate that Mattapan, Roxbury, Dorchester, and East Boston had a significantly higher percentage of residents than the rest of Boston who reported being food insecure. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 48 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Figure 27.

Among this sample, one -third of respondents indicated that in the past 12 months they felt it was sometimes or often true that they worried that their food would run out before they had money to buy more ( Figure 28). Examining data by primary language spoken, nearly two-thirds of the survey respondents (63.2%) who spoke Haitian Creole reported being food insecure, although it should be noted that the sub -sample only included 54 respondents.

Food insecurity questions are now being asked of MassHealth patients in the new Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) in the city. Among MassHealth patients screened in primary care settings in the Partners Health care System and Boston Medical Center, 33% indicated that in the past 12 months, they were worried they would run out of food before they had money to buy more as well as that the food they had bought did not last and they did not have money to buy more ( Table 6 and Table 7).

Additional food insecurity data on the percentage of Boston residents who reported feeling hungry but did not eat because they could not affor d food, by selected characteristics and by neighborhood, can be found in APPENDIX I CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Use and Perceptions of Food Assistance and Access Residents across multiple focus groups discussed that assistance programs and community services are critical to help those who are challenged with affording food. Focus group participants described community gardens and farmer's markets as strengths in th eir communities that can be leveraged; though participants stressed that it is imperative that these initiatives continue to consider cost and accept SNAP benefits. Community gardens were described to have a dual focus of cleaning up neighborhood land and ensuring access to affordable food. Specific organizations that were mentioned as assets include The Urban Farming Institute and Mattapan Food and Fitness Coalition . In Chinatown, key informants described the opportunity to create more roof -top community g ardens to provide healthy food and address environmental concerns in the neighborhood. It was noted that engaging young people in these initiatives is imperative for sustainability and intergenerational connections. Nearly 20% of Boston residents receive benefits from the Supplementation Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (formerly food stamps) ( Figure 29). For Dorchester (zip codes 02121, 02125) and Roxbury, approxima tely one -third of residents receive SNAP benefits. Rates are significantly higher among Dorchester, Roxbury, Mattapan, and the South End than Boston overall. Figure 29.

One interviewee shared, \"We need to be looking into things like Medicaid reimbursements for food prescriptions and health incentive programs for SNAP benefits that incentivize residents to buy healthy food.\" Similarly, s enior focus group participants discussed the positive impact of these initiatives with one sharing, \"One benefit about being a patient at BMC is t hat in the Spring and Summertime you can have fresh vegetables and fruit from their rooftop garden.\" Other suggestions from key informants include: strengthening the Collaborative food low -income communities; giving residents finan cial independence to have autonomy of what they can purchase with SNAP benefits; having food pantry hours that are accessible to working families; and providing healthier options at food pantries to include more fresh produce, meat, and dairy. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 52 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative SOCIAL AND PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT - WHAT IS THE COMMUNITY CONTEXT FOR BOSTON RESIDENTS? Housing Why is This Important? Where people live is integral to their daily lives, health, and well -being. The conditions in the home and neighborhood environment may promote health or be a source of exposures that may increase the risk of adverse health outcomes.21 Housing is generally the largest household expense. For homeowners, it can be an important source of wealth.22 However, housing instability and stress of housing affordability have been found to be associated with poorer mental health outcomes and disrupt ions in work, school, and day care arrangements.23 Housing instability has been associated with poorer outcomes for children related to risk for developmental delays, being underweight, and lower school attendanc e. Poor housing quality can have direct nega tive health impacts such as respiratory conditions (e.g., asthma) due primarily to poor indoor air quality \u2014and can be one of the strongest drivers for asthma -related emergency department visits among children. Housing conditions can also result in cognitiv e delays in children from exposure to neurotoxins (e.g., lead), and accidents and injuries as a result of structural deficiencies.24 Key Findings in this Section The high and rising cost of housing in Boston was a main theme that emerged in discussions with focus group participants and interviewees. Two -thirds (65%) of housing units across Boston are renter -occupied and renter household s spend an average of $1,445 per month on housing. More than half of those in renter -occupied units are housing cost -burde ned, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing. More than half of Boston renter households spend 30% or more of their income on housing costs. A significantly higher proportion of households in East Boston, Fenway, Roslindale and South Boston are cost -burdened than those in other neighborhoods; additionally, Black home owner and renter household s are significantly more likely to spend 30% or more of their income on housing, compared to the Bo ston average. Assessment participants' perceptions of increasing housing costs are mirrored in the statistics: from 2011 to 2016 median single -family house prices increased across every neighborhood in Boston and the median price increased by 48% in Boston overall. Additional pressures include gentrification, long wait lists for housing assistance programs , and for some, housing discrimination. Overcrowding, homelessness, and poor quality housing were reported to be consequences of a tight and expensive hou sing market. Housing costs comprise a large and ever -increasing portion of household budgets, interviewees and focus group members report, leaving few resources for other needs such as health care , medicine, or nutritious food. There was general consensus across conversations 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 53 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative that more affordable housing is needed in Boston, although quantitative data suggest that the proportion of affordable housing to market rate housing is decreasing. Housing Burden and Affordability Lack of affordable housing was a pro minent theme that arose across all key informant interviews and focus groups. Participants across geographies consistently shared that the rising cost of living in Boston was a major day -to-day concern. Most participants reported a need for more affordable housing for low and moderate -income levels. Quantitative data also indicate that the proportion of affordable housing to market rate is decreasing, rather than increasing. Even with the growth in development, the proportion of affordable housing units in total production in Boston has been falling since 2003. In the period 1996 to 2003, more than 39 percent of all permits were for affordable units. In the following period, 2004 -2010, the proportion was down to less than 26 percent, and from 2011 -2016, the proportion has fallen to about 18 percent.25 It should be noted, however, that in 2018, the City of Boston documented that the number of income -restricted affordable units in Boston was 19%, or nearly one in five. This is the highest ratio of income -restricted housing in any major city in the United States .26 Boston has further committed to maintain this one in five ratio as part of the housing production and preservation plan that is currently underway, and is working to raise the number of inc ome-restricted affordable units from 54,000 to 70,000 by the year 2030. Several focus group and interview participants noted that high housing costs were particularly difficult for people with low or fixed incomes, such as seniors and residents who work l ow- wage jobs. Many described the influx of housing developments being built across the city but perceived that the cost of these units was often inaccessible to the average resident. One focus group participant shared, \"The people who live here do not have access to the new apartments coming up in East Boston. How are we supposed to access rents that are $2,000 -3,000 and maintain a life?\" Housing cost data aligns with resident and leader concerns cited during focus groups and interviews. Housing costs are a larger economic burden for renters in the city. (See APPENDIX I for additional data on percent of housing units that are renter - and owner -occupied. ) According to the American Community Survey, more than half (52.1%) of renter -occupied units and one-third (35%) of owner -occupied units across Boston spent 30% or more of their income on housing costs ( Figure 30 and Figure 31). A significantly higher proportion of residents in rental units in Roslindale (62%), South Boston (60%), Fenway (59%), East Boston (59%), and Jamaica Plain (58%) spent at least 30% of their i ncome on housing cos ts, compared to the Boston overall average . Similarly, c ompared to Boston overall, a significantly higher proportion of residents of owner -occupied units in East Boston (47%), South Boston (47%), Roslindale (45%), Hyde Park (43%), and F enway (41%) spent at least 30% of their income on housing. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 54 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Figure 30.

In 2017, 48% of Black households that own their homes and 59% of Black households that rent their homes were spent 30% or more of their income on housing, compared to the Boston average , a significant difference . In contrast, 25% of White households that own their homes and 41% of White households that rent their homes spent at least 30% of their income on housing, significantly less than the Boston average.

South Boston, Back Bay, and Allston/Brighton had the highest monthly rental prices. Dorchester ($812) and Roxbury ($917 and $1 ,074) had the low est rental costs per month. Overall, Boston households spent an average of $1,445 per month on housing if they rent and $2,293 per month if they owned their housing unit with a mortgage. APPENDIX I includes detailed data on average monthly housing costs by zip code. Compared to similarly sized cities, these figures are similar to Washington DC, but less expensive than San Francisco, CA and more expensive than Denver, CO. Median monthly housing costs for renter households differed by race/ethnicity. The average rent for White ($1,849) households was significantly higher than Boston overall , while it was significantly lower for Black ($1,2 34) and Latino ($1,142) households . Rental costs for Asian households ($1,527) were similar to the average across Boston (Figure 33). 31.8%37.2%48.2% *41.2% 25.4% *50.6%58.1%58.6% *56.3% 41.4% * Boston Asian with Mortgage Renter2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 56 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Figure 33. Median Monthly Housing Costs, by Boston and Race/Ethnicity , 2017 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census, American Community -Year Estimates, 2017 NOTE: Asterisk (*) denotes race/ethnicity estimate was significantly different compared to the Boston estimate (p < 0.05) Given the concerns raised about housing affordability in focus groups and interviews, it is not surprising that housing costs have risen in the past several years. From 2011 to 2016, the median price for single -family homes in Boston increased by 48%, from $359,000 (2011) to $530,000 (2016) (See APPENDIX I for detailed tables on home prices.) Home prices increased in each neighborhood over this period for which data were available. The largest increase in home prices was seen in East Boston (152 %) and Roxbury (107%) . According to key informants and most focus group participants who identified as low -income, housing costs comprise a large part of spending for their households, leaving few resources for other needs such as health care, medicine, or nutritious food. One interviewee shared, \" Many folks who are rent burdened are paying [up to] 50% of their income in rent; most of their resources going to this very essential need. The choices that people have to make \u2014whether its not being able to ever t ake a vacation, not being able to purchase clothing or pay your bills... causes immense stress and mental health issues for care takers and children.\" The notion that children adopt the stressors of rising housing costs was also noted by multiple key informa nts with experience working with children. One shared, \" Kids can feel when their parents are stressed because maybe the landlord raised the rent or something broke in the house. They're one situation away from eviction.\" Further, some interview and focus g roup participants reported instances of residents staying in emotionally or physically un -healthy environments because they could not afford other circumstances. For example, on e interviewee shared, \"[Lack of] affordable housing affects the most vulnerable in a lot of ways. It can create unsafe situations in cases like abuse or violence in the home when there is no other place to go.\" Participants indicated that residents who are undocumented and those that do not speak English are particularly vulnerable for this type of abuse. Similar to focus group and interview participants, Boston CHNA community survey respondents also indicated that housing costs were a heavy burden for their household. As shown in Figure 34, one in five (19.5%) Boston CHNA community survey respondents reported having trouble paying their rent or mortgage. Survey responses to this question significantly differed by $2,303$2,432$2,009 *$2,220$2,401 $763$763 $669$714 $805$1,541$1,527$1,234 *$1,142 *$1,849 * Boston Latino WhiteOwner with Mortgage Owner without Mortgage Renter2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 57 Boston race/ethnicity, age, gender identity, educational attainment, LGBTQ status, and parent status.

Among the Boston CHNA survey respondents who reported moving in the past five years, the primary reasons for their move were: to be closer to work, school or family (19.5%); and issues paying rent or mortgage (16.3%) (See APPENDIX I for more detailed data). Gentrification and Housing Costs Gentrification, generally used to describe the displacement of low -income communities by afflu ent outsiders, was mentioned across all focus groups and interviews and was directly correlated with unaffordable housing costs. Many focus group participants spoke of experiences being \"priced out\" of neighborhoods and perceived that there was an influx of more affluent, White, community resid ents across the city. Focus group participants and key informants shared that while displacement was impacting all of the neighborhoods across Boston, it or less (N=380) graduate or more (N=830) (N=1,198) LGBTQ (N=225) Parent of child under 18 (N=502) Not parent of child under 18 (N=1,054)2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 58 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative disproportionately impacting communities of color, especially those in Dorchester, Roxbury, Mattap an, and East Boston. One informant summarized, \"White community members are flocking to Dorchester and Roxbury when it's historically consisted of low -income communities of color.\" Further, gentrification was perceived by multiple key informants to have r esulted in families living further away from social service agencies and specialty care, further exacerbating issues of access. One interviewee explained how, \"There's been a dramatic increase in housing costs in the last several years. You're seeing more [immigrant] families unable to meet the pressure and are being pushed out to places like Quincy and Randolph because they cannot afford Dorchester...making it harder to access socialization for seniors, health care , linguistic resources. What is going to hap pen when a majority of constituents are no longer in the city?\" Gentrification often was discussed in a negative light , with residents perceiving that gentrification in their neighborhoods contributed to increasing rents and property values . East Boston re sidents discussed the challenges of living a quality life as housing costs steadily becoming unaffordable. One shared, \" Rent is becoming impossible in East Boston...it's hard to have a good quality of life here. There are all of these high rises, but we don' t get to access those nice things. People are coming here to take what we have been building for decades.\" Homeownership was discussed as a means to acquire wealth and stability; however, it was noted by several key informants that opportunities for homeownership were not as accessible to communities of color. One interviewee explained how children from neighborhoods being impacted by gentrification are growing up without models of what homeownership can look like in non -White commun ities. One interviewee shared, \"We live in a culture where many of our Black and Latino kids only know renting. They associate homeownership with White families and something as unattainable for their families.\" While most assessment participants viewed gentrification negatively, a few spoke of the unique opportunities it posed if done correctly through new investments in building and infrastructure and increased economic activities. One interviewee shared, \"Many people are - rightly - concerned about gen trification, but at least there is interest and activity in Chinatown and conditions are rising. It could have continued on the downward trajectory, being abandoned and forgotten, but instead there is investment and interest, and that's a better position t o be in.\" Housing Assistance Across many focus groups and in several key informant interviews, residents noted that the demand for Section 8 and other subsidy programs is much larger than what is available, resulting in very long wait lists. (Section 8 ref ers to Section 8 of the Housing Act of 1937 and is a public program which authorizes payment rental housing assistance to private landlords on behalf of low -income households.) For e xample, residents from Roxbury and Dorchester reported instances of being denied housing because landlords did not want to accept Section 8 housing. One shared, \" I've been told that I can't live in certain places because the landlord was no longer renting to Section 8 tenants.\" Other participants in the group agreed and one adde d, \"Landlords don't want to [accept] section 8 anymore so they don't update the apartment because in order to receive Section 8 the place has to be up to code.\" According to multiple key informants and focus group participants, these issues were compounded for residents who are disabled, elderly, or for those with a criminal record. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 59 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Those working with older adults expressed concern for seniors on fixed incomes who are not able to remain in their homes and then must face long wait lists for affordable senior housing. One interviewee shared, \" Housing is a big issue for seniors who are retired or disabled. We see retired elders who are not eligible for housing, or if they are, wait lists are more than 5 years long for accessible housing.\" Similarly, a public ho using resident from Dorchester explained, \"We have elderly folks who are being displaced because [public] housing units aren't accessible [for the disabled] and there are no call buttons in case they need help.\" Overcrowding The housing cost burden has cascading effects on residents' home and social environment. Overcrowding, housing instability, and homelessness are a few of the themes that emerged in discussions with focus group and interview participants. For example, f ocus group participan ts who identified as low -wage workers explained that in order to make ends meet , it was often a necessity to live in multigenerational households, with roommates, or with multiple families . One focus group participant shared, \"I am trying to get ahead so I work two jobs overnight, but because I can't afford rent on my own , I have a lot of roommates. You live with too much stress because you're working too hard, and then you have to come back home to a lot of people who might be noisy or unclean.\" Further, a few key informants described resident requirements imposed on city employees that are increasingly burdensome as the cost of housing becomes more expensive. One interviewee shared, \"I can't tell you how much I've heard of younger city employees having mul tiple jobs, needing to supplement their income with a second or third job. It's hard for people, for working families to make ends meet [with these requirements].\" Overcrowding is defined as more than one person per room living in a housing unit. Accord ing to those respondents of the American Community Survey, one in ten residents in East Boston (9.8%) experienced overcrowded housing - a proportion that was triple the average across Boston (3.1%) ( Figure 35). Figure 35.

Specifically, parents of younger children noted that they felt landlords discriminated against families, especially single -parent households. One East Boston resident shared, \" There are owners of houses and the first thing they ask you is whether or not you have kids and how many. If you have kids, they don't want to rent to you.\" Focus group participants who resided in Allston/Brighton also spoke of challenges finding housing as parents. One ex plained, \" In this area, it's very difficult to find apartments because it's expensive and they ask for so many [requirements] -and they always ask about children too - they don't like if you have children. It's difficult to find a nice place and if you fin d it, the rest is so expensive.\" Other focus group participant s who reported experiencing housing discrimination include participants who identified as: those in recovery or actively using, residents with a criminal record, and communities of color . In 2018, there were 51 discrimination cases relating to housing filed in Boston by Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD), compared to 44 cases filed in Boston in 2017. Among the housing discrimination cases in 2018, six in ten cases were filed based on discrimination against a protected disability status (61%) ( Figure 36). Nearly four in ten (39%) housing discrimination cases in 2018 were filed due to discri mination based on race. Approximately o ne in ten discrimination cases was attributed to public assistance (12%), sex (12%), sexual orientation (12%), age (10%), and retaliation (10%). Figure 36.

Focus group participants from these neighborhoods perceived that homelessness was on the rise and often related those who were homeless with mental health or substance use issues. However, key infor mants with expertise in housing indicated that homelessness impacts a diverse range of residents across the city regardless of health status, race, or family makeup. In 2018, there were an estimated 6,188 residents that were counted as homelessness or hou sing unstable in Boston ( Table 8). It should be noted that these data may not account for residents who are temporarily without a permanent address and are staying with friends or in their car. Among those identified, t he majority o f homeless residents were staying in emergency shelters (5,427 individuals ), followed by transitional shelters (598 individuals ), and unsheltered housing (163 individuals ). Among this homeless population, f our in ten homeless residents identified as Black (45 .1%), 36.1% as white, and 17.0% as two or more races. More than 35% identified as Latino ( any race).

Three in ten homeless households included at least one adult and one child (31.8%). One percent of homeless households included only children (1%). Emergency shelter was the most common type of shelter for homeless households, followed by transitional housing. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 62 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Table 9.

Of these groups, LGBTQ youth were identified as being especially vulnerable to becoming homeless, particularly for those who identify as transgender or non -binary. LGBTQ youth in focus groups indicated that t his was in part due to family rejection, a lack of emotional supports, or limited resources for those who identified as transgender or non -binary. One transgender focus group participant from Jamaica Plain shared, \" For those of us who are homeless, Boston on ly has single sex shelters. But where does that leave trans people like me?\" It should be noted that Boston has enacted non - discrimination policies in housing and shelters that prohibit discrimination against transgender or gender -nonconforming persons.27 For example, Boston Public Health Commission is one of the largest shelter providers in New England. Their policy is that transgender guests choose the shelter that corresponds with their gender identity or whichever shelter they feel most comfortable in. While homelessness was described as impacting diverse groups, the experience of trauma was a reported commonality among them. Several interviews discussed that trauma was a significant challenge to overcom ing housing instability. One interviewee illuminat ed this experience by explaining: \" Many of our [homeless] parents have also suffered from other traumas including childhood traumas, regardless of specific backgrounds (race, culture, community). All parents coming to [homeless shelters] show strong resili ence and grit. However, they don't always have the tools to take them out of the day -to-day crisis; once your life spirals, it can be challenging to get out of that, especially if you're walking around with trauma on your back.\" Additionally, some key inf ormants shared the perception that law enforcement is increasingly being asked to intervene with the homeless population, even if they may not be the appropriate first-responders. One interviewee explained, \" Being homeless is not a crime, but when people see homeless individuals, they assume they might be a criminal and call [the police] to remove them from places.\" However, key informants noted that compared to other cities, Boston has a sophisticated strategy to address ing chronic homelessness by using r eal-time data to drive priorities and working with a host of partners across sectors including the public health department, the Boston Housing Authority, and nonprofit organizations including Pine Street Inn, Boston Health care for the Homeless, and St. F rancis House, among others. One shared, \" The city has a 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 63 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative common database that everyone who works with homeless people can access called Efforts to Outcomes. The city hosts the data and produces a quarterly list of the longest -term stayers (i.e. the chronica lly homeless), who are then prioritized for housing through a matching system.\" Interviewees in the field discussed that w hile up -to-date, centralized data are a key first step to addressing chronic homelessness, more resources are needed for newly homele ss families or for residents who have been homeless for a year or less. One interviewee explained, \"Ironically, people who are homeless but [who are not categorized] as \"chronic\" have fewer options and limited resources.\" There was also the perception that the length of stays in homeless shelters is increasing, partly due to long wait lists for subsidized housing, which was described as straining resources for newly -homeless families. One interviewee explained, \"Boston has great shelters in the area that are temporarily housing mothers with young children, but it's hard because [families] may be in the shelter for up to two years because of the inability to find an apartment that accepts Section 8 vouchers.\" Among ACO MassHealth patients who were scre ened in Partners Health care and Boston Medical Center primary care settings, 17% were indicated that they were homeless or did not have a steady place to live ( Table 10). Table 10. Boston MassHealth Patients from Partners Health care and Boston Medical Center Screened for Social Needs and Are Homeless Total Screened # Homeless % Homeless 7,886 1,320 17% DATA SOURCE: Social Needs Screening Data, Partners Health care and Boston Medical Center (BMC), 2018 NOTES: Analyses only among MassHealth ACO primary care patients and Boston residents Positive screen as homeless for patients who indicated that they do no t have housing or do not have a steady place to live (e.g., temporarily staying with others, in a hotel, in a shelter, living outside on the street, on a beach, in a car, abandoned buil ding, bus or train station, or in a park) Housing Conditions Housing qu ality and poor housing conditions were themes discussed in several conversations for this data gathering effort. These key points are explored here, yet a deeper dive discussion on specific indoor environmental exposures and health effects of poor housing quality can be found in the Environmental Health section of this report. Participants across most groups voiced concerns about the old housing stock in the city of Boston, specifically mentioning lead, mold, rodents, and insects as issues in their neighbor hoods . However, specific themes arose in focus groups with residents of particular neighborhoods. Focus group participants from Allston/Brighton reported being generally satisfied with the quality of housing in their neighborhoods, citing universities and health care institutions that have made investments to improve their neighborhood's living conditions. One resident shared, \"Living in Allston is very good because the universities are creating a lot of new buildings and resources for the neighborhood to make it nicer .\" On the contrary, focus group residents from Chinatown, Dorchester, and East Boston specifically discussed concerns around housing quality in their neighborhoods, citing housing stock in disrepair, overcrowding, and a lack of investments as key issues . Focus group participants from Mattapan and Dorchester perceived that landlords often \" do what they want\" including developing additional units within their buildings without notifying residents. One M attapan resident shared, \"My landlord is making 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 64 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative the basement into a 3 -bedroom apartment, but they didn't even let us know. I thought construction places are supposed to hold community meetings but they're not, and if they are, if they are making people awa re of them.\" Another focus group participant shared this sentiment and added, \" Some greedy landlords will divide one apartment into multiple tiny units for renters.\" Similarly, key informants cited a need for more equitable investments across housing units in Chinatown. One shared, \"There has been a resurgence in the [Chinatown] community over the last eight years. In some cases, buildings where people have lived for a long time have been bought out and/or renovated. But there are also landlords who are not spending the money to keep up their buildings; it would be nice to see more of an investment in these properties.\" Focus group participants who identified as low -income and/or housing insecure indicated that with such high demands for apartments, tenants are less likely to voice concerns of poor housing conditions out of fear of being evicted or losing their home. One East Boston resident shared, \"There are a lot of situations where people are living in housing that is not good and they can't say anything because they are scared to be kicked out.\" Transportation Why is This Important? Transportation connects people with and between where they live, learn, play, and work. Transportation can promote health by enabling individuals, families, and communitie s to access resources and opportunities, including employment, health care, education, and other goods and services (e.g., grocery stores, parks).28 Active forms of transportation, such as walking and cycling, can also be health promoting, reducing the risk of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease and improving mental health and community cohesion.29 Transportation can also have health consequences, including traffic -related accidents, air pollution exposure, and sedentary lifestyles linked with less active forms of transportation.30 \"Most [residents] rely on public transportation and it is difficult when the signs are not in their language. They may not understand announcements about delays or emergencies, and it makes them feel insecure about how to navigate.\" \u2014 Key informant interviewee Key Findings in this Section Though many residents who participated in focus groups perceived improvements in transportation in recent years, others expressed concerns about cost, timeliness, and accessibility of public transportation especially for the elderly, those with limited Eng lish proficiency, and for residents of neighborhoods who have traditionally had limited access to transportation. Slightly over one-third of Boston residents use a personal vehicle to get to work, and another one-third use public transportation; use of public transportation is particularly high in East Boston and Jamaica Plain. On average, Bostonians spend about 11% of household income on transportation -related expenses. Parking and traffic were mentioned as day -to-day concerns for many community residents. Challenges with public transit and transportation programs, including lack of reliability, difficulty navigating the system, overcrowding, and the need to schedule in advance, can make it difficult to keep medical app ointments according to 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 65 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative focus group members and interviewees. Efforts such as Go Boston 2030 and bike share programs were seen as positive steps to address the city's transportation challenges. Views of Transportation Residents in focus groups across diffe rent neighborhoods shared mixed perceptions about transportation. Some participants reported being generally satisfied with transportation access in their neighborhoods, while others voiced concerns about cost, timeliness, and accessibility for the elderly . For example, focus group participants from Allston/Brighton and Jamaica Plain reported being satisfied with transportation in their neighborhoods, citing close proximity to buses and trains. Focus group participants in Mattapan noted improvements to key Mattapan bus routes in recent years. One participant shared , \"The Commuter Rail just opened a stop at Mattapan near Simco from Hyde Park to Mattapan; it used to be such a headache. There are many buses that goes through there[now] - things have gotten bette r.\" Still, Mattapan was described by focus group participants living in other neighborhoods as a neighborhood that needed improvements to public transportation. Residents in Chinatown reported being satisfied with the proximity of public transportation options but expressed concern with the cleanliness of bus and train platforms. One resident shared, \"I think the subway and bus system are very convenient. But the subways are so dirty, I can always notice strong urine odor by Chinatown station and Tufts Med ical Center station.\" Similarly, others spoke about the old infrastructure of the city's public transportation system. As one key informant interviewee noted, \"We have an old transit system that needs a lot of investments in order to maintain what we curr ently have.\" Data show that the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) is well -used. According to the Regional Indicators report by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC), in 2015, the MBTA experienced an average of approximately 32,966, 627 passenger trips per month.31 Means of Transportation and Transportation Costs Across Boston, use of a personal vehicle (39%) was the most common form of transportation to work, followed by public transportation (34%), walking (15%), and carpooling (6%) in 2013 - 2017 . Transportation patterns varied significantly across most Boston neighborhoods . Compared to Boston overall, East Boston (58%), Jamaica Plain (43%), Roxbury had a signi ficantly higher proportion of residents who used public transportation to go to work (see APPEND IX I, for significance testing ). West Roxbury (17%) and the South End (28%) had a significantly lower percentage of residents who used public transportation to get to work ( Figure 37). 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 66 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Figure 37. Means of Transportation to Work for Population 16 Years and Over, by Boston and Neighborhood, 2013 -2017 DATA SOURCE: U.S. Census, American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates, 2013 -2017 NOTE: Neighborhoods as defined by Boston Public Health Commission; Back Bay includes Back Bay, Beacon Hill, Downtown, North E nd, and West End; South End includes South End and Chinatown In 2015, 1,056 patients of 14 community health centers across Boston were asked about their means of transit to the health center on the day of their health center visit ( Figure 38). The bus was the most common form of transportation for patients who identified as Black (54%), Latino (44%), or Multi -Racial (44%), followed by driving (27% -38%). Among respondents who identified as Asian, h alf (51%) reported driving to the health center a nd one -quarter (26%) used the bus to get to the health center. Among respondents who identified as White , driving (40%) was the most common form of transit to the health center, followed by taking the bus (34%) Jamaica Plain Mattapan Roslindale Roxbury South Boston South End West RoxburyCar, truck, van - alone Car, truck, van - carpool Public transportation Walked Other2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 67 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Figure 38. Percent Survey Respondents Reported Usual Form of Transit Taken to Health Center, by Race/Ethnicity, 2015 DATA SOURCE: Fair Public Transportation Report: Community Health Center Directors Roundtable, 2015 In 2014, data show that residents in t he Boston Metropolitan Statistical Area spent $9,997 on average on transportation costs, which includes costs relating to vehicles and public transit.32 From FY2001 to FY2014 residents in the Boston Metropolitan Statistical Area spent 11 -13% of their house hold income on transportation (See APPENDIX I ). Transportation Barriers Across most focus groups, parking and traffic were mentioned as a day-to-day concern for many community residents. Focus group participants in Dorchester indicated that these problems are compounded during the winter months because of the snow, especially on dead - end streets. According to key informants, rapid developmen t happening across the city is compounding parking issues. As one participant explained, \" The idea that the city would provide more housing without parking is a real challenge, especially as you start thinking of initiatives like dedicated bus lanes.\" Further, ride shares such as Uber and Lyft were described as exacerbating congestion issues. One interviewee shared, \"Uber and Lyft provide more accessibility to transit and is a great resource for disabled residents and seniors. But we see these trips competi ng with public transit, and we're seeing more trips happening in peak hours, adding to congestion.\" Several focus group and interview participants, namely those from Dorchester and Mattapan, noted that seniors struggle with accessing transportation because of mobility issues or because assistance programs are not consistent or timely. For example, senior focus group participants explained often being late or missing medical appointments because transportation assistance was unreliable. Others indicated that it was difficult to coordinate services because of having to book rides multiple days in advance or because the vehicles were inaccessible. One Dorchester resident shared, \"For rides through social services, you have to call 3 days in advance and they are still late. Then when your appointment is done you sit there all day waiting.\" Another resident agreed and added , \"The vans that come to pick up [seniors] are very tall and [we] can't get into them and it's frightening.\" Further, a few focus group partici pants noted concerns of proposed bus routes being cut, sharing, \" An upcoming concern for me is that the MBTA is thinking of cutting some bus lines and it could impact Multi-raceTrain Bus Driving Got a ride Bike Walk2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 68 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Transportation barriers were also identified by those with limited English proficiency, who reported difficulties navigating the transit system. For example, one key informant explained, \"Most [residents] rely on public transportation and it is difficult when the signs are not in their language. They may not understand announcem ents about delays or emergencies, and it makes them feel insecure about how to navigate.\" It was noted that these issues were especially challenging for older adults and seniors. Some key informants perceived that gentrification was forcing residents furth er from social services, which exacerbates the challenges to public transportation. One key informant shared, \"[Residents] with mobility issues may be able to take advantage of services like The RIDE from MBTA, but you have to call and request that service , and for Chinese -speaking individuals, that can be a challenge.\" A few focus group participants mentioned the recent increases to MBTA fares and the perception that these increases disproportionally impact seniors, low -wage workers, and communities of col or. Reflecting the themes that emerged in focus groups and interviews, 23.1% of Boston CHNA survey respondents cited limited street parking, traffic -related noise, or traffic as a barrier to getting to medical appointments. Nearly one in five (19.2%) of Bo ston CHNA survey respondents identified the availability of public transportation as a barrier, while one -quarter 15.5% cited the cost of transportation a barrier ( Table 11). These top reasons were similar among survey respondents who spoke a language other than English, although Chinese and Vietnamese speakers were significantly more likely to indicate that clear and understandable transportation signs and directions were a transportation barrier. Table 11. Percent Boston CHNA Survey Respondents Reported Transportation Barriers to Getting to Medical Appointments, Meetings, Work, or Getting Things Needed for Daily Living, By All Respondents and Primary Language, 2019 All Respondents (N=2,012) Chinese (N=137) English (N=1,769) Haitian Creole (N=55) Portuguese (N=47) Spanish (N=362) Vietnamese (N=82) Limited street parking, traffic - traffic 23.1% 16.1% 23.2% 3.6% 6.4% 7.7% Needs Asse ssment 69 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative APPENDIX I shows data for transportation barriers by neighborhoods with large enough sub - sample sizes. Limited street parking, traffic -related noise, or traffic was similarly the most frequently selected barrier among respondents living in Roslindale (26.8%), South End (23.2%), Jamaica Plain (22.7%), Hyde Park (20.2%), Dorchester (24.8%), and East Boston (28.2%). Among those living in Mattapan, respondents were most likely to report the cost of transporta tion as a barrier (19.8%). In Allston/Brighton and Roxbury communities, respondents most frequently reported the availability of public transportation as a barrier (26.7% and 20.7%, respectively). Transportation Resources It was noted by key informants th at the city is working towards efforts to address transportation issues through initiatives like Go Boston 2030, a city plan that aims to address Boston's most pressing transportation issues by address long -term inequality, increasing economic mobility, an d improving environmental health impacts in the next 5, 10, and 15 years. Interviews reported that while these efforts are a step in a positive direction, more is needed to address transportation equity across the city. One suggestion was to focus on provi ding faster commutes on buses for lower income communities of color such as Mattapan and Roxbury. An interviewee explained that in high needs areas \" there's a huge opportunity to improve bus service through dedicated lane or queue jumps (a type of roadway geometry used to provide preference to buses at intersections, often found in bus rapid transit systems).\" Key informants noted the addition of Blue Bikes and protected bike lanes in recent years as initiatives that were alleviating some congestion and accessibility issues; however, they commented that these efforts will need to be bolstered and creative solutions will be needed to address the increasing traffic and parking pressures caused by development. Local solutions to transportation barriers were cited as most effective; one key informant expert suggested that municipalities and towns explore taking a more active role in transportation taxes in order to generate revenue for operational costs at the local level. Lastly, there was a suggestion f or larger institutions to take a lead in modeling responsible transportation practices. One interviewee shared, \"I think these big institutions can start helping with their own practices. It's helpful when organizations adopt policies that provide their st aff with transportation opportunities.\" Green Space and the Built Environment Why is This Important? Over 8% of land in Boston is comprised of parks, playgrounds, and athletic fields. Green space and the built environment influence the public's health , particularly in relation to chronic diseases. Urban environments and physical spaces can expose people to toxins or pollutants, affecting health conditions such as cancer, lead poisoning, and asthma.33 There is compelling evidence that changes in environm ental policies can have an impact on children and families.34 Physical space influences lifestyles: playgrounds, green spaces, and trails as well as bike lanes and safe sidewalks and crosswalks all encourage physical activity and social interaction, which p ositively affect physical and mental health.35 Specifically, lower rates of 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 70 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative childhood obesity and decreased levels of stress among adolescents have been associated with safe, accessible green spaces and other built environment elements.36 Key Findings in This Section Slightly over 8% of land in Boston is comprised of parks, playgrounds, and athletic fields and about 7% is parkways, reservations, and beaches. Boston has a walkability score of 81, indicating a \"very walkable\" community.37 However , focus group members and interviewees shared that the built environment varies across neighborhoods. Those from Allston/Brighton, Chinatown, and Dorchester perceived insufficient green space across their neighborhoods, which they attributed to the growth in new housing developments. In contrast, interviewees and focus group participants described Jamaica Plain and East Boston as neighborhoods with ample access to green space. Participants also shared additional concerns specific to their neighborhoods, wit h those from Dorchester, Mattapan, and Chinatown expressing concern about safety in their community open spaces, as well as challenges with rodents, snow removal, and lack of public restrooms. Green Space The importance of accessible green space and its r elation to health was discussed in multiple focus groups throughout the city. As one focus group participant summarized, \" You need to keep a good environment to maintain a healthy life.\" Focus group participants in Allston/Brighton, Chinatown, and Dorchest er perceived a decrease in green space across their neighborhoods and attributed the decline to new housing developments under construction. One focus group participant explained, \" People are cutting the trees for the big buildings . If you take the trees, you find more carbon monoxide, increases in cancer, more stress...you will not find peace in the community anymore.\" A parent from Allston agreed and added \"I'm under the impression that people are forgetting about children [in Allston/Brighton]. How is it t hat there are more dog parks and not any parks for children?\" Focus group participants in Dorchester, Mattapan, and Chinatown expressed concerns about individual safety in their community open spaces, citing an increase in used needles on sidewalks, playgr ounds, and parks. On the contrary, interviewees and focus group participants described Jamaica Plain and East Boston as neighborhoods with ample access to green space. Specific outdoor spaces that were mentioned as community strengths included Piers Park i n East Boston, the Arboretum in Jamaica Plain, and Franklin Park in Dorchester. As noted in the Approximately 49% of Boston's 47 square miles (excluding Harbor Islands) is zoned residential while approximately 24% is zoned as business, institutional, industrial, or mixed -use. The remaining 27% consists mostly of open space and miscellaneous. Figure 39 displays the green space and open space in Boston, where 8.3% of land is comprised of parks, playgrounds, and athletic fields and 7.4% is parkways, reservations, and beaches. As noted in Health of Boston 2016 -2017 report, approximately 11 square miles of Boston's 48 square miles (including the Harbor Isla nds) is open space. Boston also comprises 29 miles of bicycle trails. The largest portions of bicycle trails are in East Boston and Hyde Park (about 6 miles each); however, there is less than 1 mile of bicycle trails in Mattapan and Roslindale.38 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 71 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Figure 39.

The Walk Score walkability index, ranges from 0 to 100, based on walking ro utes to local destinations such as grocery stores, parks, schools, and store outlets. Boston is the 3rd most walkable large city with a Walk Score of 81. In 2017, the Walk Score varied widely by zip code in Boston from 57 to 99 ( Figure 40. The highest Walk Score was observed in the zip codes associated with North End (99 in 02113) and Back Bay/Bay Village (98 in 02199), while the lowest Walk Score was observed in the zip codes associated with Hyde Park (57 in 02136) and West Roxbury (61 in 02132). 2019 Community Health Asse ssment 72 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Figure 40: Walk by Zip Code, 2017 DATA SOURCE: Walk Score, www.walkscore.com, as reported and analyzed by Boston Public Health Commission, Resea rch and Evaluation Office, Health of Boston Report 2016 -2017, 2017 NOTES: \"BB\" includes the Back Bay, Beacon Hill, Downtown, North End, and West End; \"SE\" includes South End and Chinatown; Wal k Score is an index of pedestrian -friendliness that ranges from 0 to 100; Data for the portion of zip code 02467 in Boston were unavailable; Map does not include the Harbor Islands Figure 41 provides a 2014 map of the city and where sidewalks are considered to be in good, fair, or poor condition. Dorchester, Roslindale, and West Roxbury appear to have the largest concentrations of poor condition sidewalks in the city. Since then, the Boston Public Works Department Streetcaster Program has focused first on sidewalk replacements, particularly in those neighborhoods which have historically initiated fewer requests for repairs to assure and innovative and equitable approach to capital resource allocation. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 73 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Figure 41. Sidewalk Conditions, by Type of Condition and Neighborhood, 2014 DATA SOURCE: Courtesy of City of Boston, Public Works Department, 2014 NOTES: City Engineers assessed the sidewalks and quantified the amount of damage each sidewalk block had. A sidewal k condition metric was calculated called the \"Sidewalk Condition Index\" also known as the SCI. This metric is a direct ratio of how \"undamaged\" the sidewalk area is. Damage can refer to sidewalks that are cracked, faulted due to tree roots, utility cut pat ches, missing bricks/material, etc. For example, if the engineers quantified 800 square feet of damage in the assessment and the total sidewalk area is 1 ,000 square feet then the SCI of that block would be a 20 (since 80% is damaged). The SCI scores were g rouped into 3 main categories: Good condition was for sidewalks that had a SCI from 80 -100, fair condition sidewalks had an SCI between 50 and 80, and the poor condition sidewalks had an SCI less than 50. The reasoning of these condition thresholds is that if the sidewalk is more than half damaged it will be considered \"poor\" and require full reconstruction since a partial repair isn't sufficient. If the SCI is between 50 -80 (fair) then it may be a candidate for partial repair. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 74 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Perceptions of the Built Envi ronment and Neighborhood Development In several focus groups across the city there was a perception that many areas were becoming overcrowded with new developments. One resident from Dorchester shared, \" They build and build until we're stuffed in like pack rats...every little slot they're building something; we're literally living on top of our neighbors.\" These overcrowding concerns were echoed in East Boston and Chinatown, with one resident sharing, \" In the mornings it's really hard to get around because th e construction makes things congested. There needs to be a response soon to everything that is being built.\" A key informant added, \" Chinatown is congested. Elliot Norton Park and Chinatown Park have very small patches of unutilized space, but nothing is t here right now. These could be better used if whoever owns these spaces put down some grass and other plants.\" In addition, a few key informants discussed the need for more dedicated bike lanes to mitigate the congestion caused by construction projects. Focus group participants and interviewees perceived that construction sites throughout the city were adding to the presence of rodents. One resident from Dorchester explained, \" I see a lot of construction, and construction breeds rats.\" Snow removal was also described as a concern by focus group participants in Chinatown, East Boston, and Dorchester. One resident shared, \"I experience many issues during snow season; the city does not clean up all the streets around Chinatown on time and t he streets get narrower when people try to park by the meters.\" Further, focus group participants who resided in the South End and in Chinatown reported a lack of public restrooms in their neighborhoods. APPENDIX I includes data on public restrooms in the city, showing a wide range of availability across neighborhoods. Social Environment Why is This Important? Relationships are important for physic al and mental well -being. At an individual level, social networks spread social behaviors: social support can help encourage people engage in more positive healthy behaviors.39 By contrast, lack of connectedness has been shown to be linked to depression and is a risk factor for early mortality.40 \"Communities have changed so radically over time; the community fabric in terms of [young people] caring for an elder has changed. Just like it takes a village to raise child, it takes a village to raise an elder.\" \u2014 Key informant interviewee At the community level, the cohesiveness of a community has been shown to be positively related to self -reported health and mortality.41 Conversely, discrimination as part of one's social environment can have a negative impact on health. S tructural discrimination such as segregation, inequitable access to quality education, and disparities in incarceration rates can limit opportunities, re sources, and well -being of less privileged groups.42 Individual discrimination may have high physical and emotional health costs as well. Research suggests that routine discrimination can be a chronic stressor and increase vulnerability to physical illness.43,44 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 75 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Key Findings in this Section Focus group members and interviewees pointed to examples of strong social networks in Boston, citing cohesion across different immigrant groups and among others who share similar racial, cultural, linguistic and religious b ackgrounds. Two -thirds of CHNA community survey respondents believed that people in their neighborhoods help each other and three -quarters perceived that they and their neighbors want the same thing for their neighborhoods. Survey respondents also indicate d strong civic engagement, as evidenced by high levels of self -reported involvement in community organizations and voting. At the same time, focus group members also mentioned a decline in community social ties, brought on by lack of time and generational differences. Gentrification has likewise changed the \"feel\" of some neighborhoods, specifically Roxbury, East Boston , and Dorchester. CHNA community survey results and conversations in focus groups indicate that subtle and overt discrimination is an issue in Boston, particularly for immigrants and non -English speakers, LGBTQ residents, and older residents and youth, substance users and the homeless. Institutional racism was discussed in greater detail as being pervasive across the city given discriminatory policies at a systems level, and is described in more detail in the Violence and Trauma section. Community Cohesion and Gentrification Community cohesion refers to community dynamics, such as a shared sense of membership, influence, social integration , and connections among residents. In focus group discussions, participants who belonged to similar affinity groups expressed a strong sense of cohesion among their communities, particularly those with similar racial, cultural, linguistic, and religious backgro unds. \"I grew up here and it's changed so much; I hardly know anyone in the neighborhood anymore.\" \u2014 Focus group participant For example, Haitian residents in Mattapan indicated supporting small businesses run by other Haitian immigrants. Residents in East Boston referenced feeling \" en casa\" with their fellow Latino neighbors ; translated to \"make yourself at home\" \u2014the phrase means to extend hospitality and respect to one's neighbor. In Chinatown, it was noted that there are strong connectio ns between newly arrived immigrants and those who have been here longer. One interviewee shared, \" Parents whose families have benefited from services give back and help advocate for other families and children. They become anchors of the community and enco urage others to use resources.\" While some groups described strong community linkages, others such as public housing residents and lower -income groups described limited connections or interactions with their neighbors. For example, residents from Dorches ter shared, \" No one knows each other anymore or talks to each other like they used to years ago. You can live right across the street from somebody and not even know their first name.\" A key informant described this type of insularity happening in South Bo ston as well, sharing , \"One of the challenges has been to get people from the housing developments to participate in community events and activities. They feel so insular in the developments...\" A few focus group and interviewees attributed these disconnects to lack of time and generational differences. Focus group participants from Chinatown, Mattapan, and Dorchester, for example, perceived the emphasis on community approaches to caring for elders 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 76 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative was not as much of a priority for young people. One key infor mant summarized, \" Communities have changed so radically over time; the community fabric in terms of [young people] caring for an elder has changed. Just like it takes a village to raise child , it takes a village to raise an elder.\" Lack of connectedness a mong seniors in the community was a concern voiced by some participants. Across groups that had experience working with seniors, social isolation was identified as the primary mental health issue for older adults. Participants spoke of co - occurring issues that stemmed from social isolation, the most common being hoarding disorder. One key informant explained, \" You'll see instances when organizations rally together to clean the home of seniors [who are hoarders]. Then we'll come back 6 months later, and thei r conditions are right back where they were and it's because they haven't left their house or spoken to anyone in weeks.\" Some key informants and focus group participants with long -standing roots in historically working -class communities of color like Ro xbury, East Boston, and Dorchester described changes in the character and culture of their neighborhoods in recent years. Specifically, it was noted that younger professionals were changing the \" feel\" of these areas. For example, one Roxbury resident shared, \" I grew up here and it's changed so much; I hardly know anyone in the neighborhood anymore.\" Focus group participants attributed this lack of community linkages to gentrification and displacement. One key informant shared, \"If you've been working with people for decades to clean up their neighborhoods who now cannot afford to live in Boston, that affects all of our work. You have people who for years have worked to get the community safer and cleaner and are now getting priced out...pushed aw ay.\" When asked about perceptions of community cohesion or connectedness, approximately three - quarters of Boston CHNA survey respondents perceived that they and their neighbors want the same thing for their neighborhood (77%) (Figure 42). While gentrification was a theme that emerged in focus groups, seven in ten Boston CHNA survey respondents indicated that they plan to live in their neighborhood for a long time (73%). Approximately two -thirds (68%) of respondents noted that their neighbors help each other out and more than half (56%) of respondents reported recognizing most people who lived in their neighborhood. Notably, despite reported ties to their neighborhood and neighbors, only approximately one -third (35%) of respondents perceived that they had influence over what their neighborhood is like. Responses to these questions by survey respondents' neighborhood can be found in APPENDIX I . 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 77 CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Figure 42. Boston CHNA Survey Respondents' Reported Perceptions of Community Cohesion in Their Neighborhood, 2019 DATA SOURCE: Boston CHNA Community Survey, 2019 NOTE: Percentage calculations do not include respondents who responded \"not applicable/don't know\" Civic Engagement Involveme nt in informal or formal social organizations and activities may reflect social integration in a community and/or residents organizing to address community needs. Forty -six percent o f Boston CHNA survey respondents , many of which were recruited to complete the survey through community organizations, reported involvement in an organization such as neighborhood association s, labor union s, immigration and civil rights group s, religious groups, community organizations, or other organizations. Boston CHNA survey respondents were asked about their civic engagement and connection to civic processes (Figure 43). Nearly nine in ten respondents indicated that it was important to be involved in government decision -making (90%). Eight in ten respondents knew who their elected representatives were (78%) . Approximately seven in ten respondents knew how to contact an elected representative (71%) or felt that they could influence decision s made at city, state, and federal I want the same thing for our neighborhood.

As shown in Figure 44, among Boston CHNA survey responde nts who are eligible to vote, nearly half (47%) reported voting in every election. One -third (36%) of respondents indicated that they voted in almost every election. Figure 44.

These experiences were described as both subtle and o vert acts felt on a regular basis ; examples rang ed from verbal altercations to more systemic issues such as people of color being passed up for job promotions despite qualifications. All of these issues were compounded when residents belonged to multiple o ppressed identities, for example, queer people of color or non-English speaking residents in recovery.

Nearly half of respondents reported being treated with less courtesy than other people (49%), people acting as if they are better than the respondent (48%), and being treated w ith less respect (47%) a few times a year or more. About one in three respondents reported experiencing poorer service than other people at restaurants or stores (29%) and one -quarter reported being called names or insulted (24%) at least a few times a ye ar. Notably, one -third of respondents reported being threatened or harassed (35%) and people acting as if they are afraid of them (30%) in their life time. Over their life course, more than one -quarter of respondents reported receiving poorer service when receiving medical care (28%). These experiences of discrimination are important as they can restrict access to health promoting resources (such as health care), serve as stressful life events, and/or shape future interactions with institutions or spaces wh ere they experienced discrimination.

Approximately half of respondents attributed their experience of discrimination to their gender (51%) or race (48%). More than one -third reported age -based discrimination (37%) and one -quarter linked their experience of discriminati on with their ancestry or national origins (26%). Approximately one in five respondents reported discrimination based on some other aspect of their physical appearance (21%) or their education or income level (20%). Figure 46.

LGBTQ -identifying residents in foc us groups discussed being discriminated against based on gender identity, especially among transgender and gender non -conforming youth. For example, focus group participants spoke of experiences where health providers would not address them by their prefer red pronoun, citing that it made them feel \" not completely seen by others.\" Other challenges cited by LGBTQ focus group participant included access to reproductive health and hormone therapy. Interviews and focus group discussions with residents help to i lluminate experiences of discrimination similar to those reported in the Boston CHNA survey. Focus group participants who identified as immigrants most commonly described instances of discrimination in public spaces like the supermarket or on public transp ortation; this was especially true for those who identified as Latino and Asian. One East Boston resident described, \"At the supermarket, I was standing close to an American and accidently [grazed] him. He looked disgusted when I touched him and wiped his arm off like an animal had touched him. That sticks with you.\" These groups perceived an increase in prejudice or discriminatory behavior in the last few years and attributed these tensions to the current political climate. Being discriminated against beca use of one's ability to speak English or because of one's accent was also a common theme among non-English focus group participants. One resident expressed, \" Even when you try to speak English - they try to humiliate your accent.\" Discrimination can come i n many different forms and be perpetrated by different types of people and institutions. Some f ocus group participants of color specifically described instances of within -group discrimination, a phenomenon where factions of a single group develop conflicts against each other as by -products of competition and prejudice. Residents in East Boston, Allston/Brighton, and Dorchester, for example, described instances feeling \" othered by their own kind\". This sentiment was illustrated by examples of employers under paying Latino residents or landlords inflating rent for residents who were not White. One shared, \" They 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 82 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative [employers] pay Americans $26 an hour for work but if you're Latino, they only pay you $10 because they know you won't report it.\" There were some ment ions of experiences with discrimination among other racial minority groups. Specifically, residents in Dorchester reported negative interactions between Black and non -Black minority groups. Focus group participants in Dorchester and Mattapan also described tensions within the Black community between African Americans and those of African or Caribbean decent. While the experiences of discrimination against homeless residents did not explicitly emerge in the Boston CHNA survey, focus group participants who were homeless described being treated poorly because of their appearance. One homeless resident shared, \"Hospitals don't treat you the same when you're homeless; they treat you really badly. If you come in you're treated badly by everyone - the security, t he nurses, the doctors.\" Homeless individuals were often associated with substance users, though some key informants explained that this is not necessarily always accurate ; that some residents are just one emergency away from becoming homeless. Lastly, fo cus group participants who identified as active substance users described being discriminated against in public spaces and at social service agencies. Some described frequently being judged by other drug users, specifically those who used pills versus hero ine or methamphetamine. One focus groups participant shared, \" One of the hardest things is people walking around with their false sobriety. People who aren't using heroin but they're on pills and they're looking down on people. You're either sober or you'r e not sober.\" A more detailed description of experiences and perceptions of institutional racism and discriminatory policies at a systems level can be found in the Violence and Trauma section. Community Assets and Resources Why is This Important? Understanding the resources and services available in a community \u2014as well as their distribution \u2014helps to elucidate the assets that can be drawn upon to address community health, as well as any gaps that might exist. These assets include both ins titutions as well as community member characteristics. Key Findings in This Section Boston communities have numerous strengths according to focus group members, interviewees, and community survey respondents . Neighborhoods were described as being \"tight -knit\" with substantial cultural diversity and strong faith communities. Sixty -eight percent of community survey respondents identified racial and cultural diversity as a top strength of their community. Activism and resiliency are other notable characteris tics of Bostonians. The city's colleges and universities are world class. \"Regardless of the changing face of the community, there is still a real sense of community here . People looking out for each other...and the amount of services and variety of serv ices is just incredible. We hope to keep that richness within the community.\" \u2014 Focus group participant 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 83 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Proximity and abundance of health care is also a key strength. Across the city, there are 22 hospitals and 33 health center access sites. Community su rvey respondents identified proximity to medical services as the top strength of their communities, with 69% of respondents identifying this a top strength. Other assets include services and supports for students at Boston Public Schools, and positive stri des in the city for LGBTQ residents, including within the school system through Gay Straight Alliances. Finally, the social services network in Boston was perceived to be large, strong, and collaborative, although some suggested more could be done to enhan ce cooperation across institutions and reduce duplication. Perceptions of Community Strengths and Assets When asked about community strengths, participants identified several assets including cultural diversity, collaborative social service organizations, and engaged community residents, among others. Many residents indicated belong ing to a strong faith -based community that provides emotional and tangible supports for those who have unmet needs . Key informants who worked with children described an \" incredi ble resilience \" among children who have experienced trauma. Proximity to health care services and educational institutions w ere also described as assets among focus group and interview participants. One f ocus group participant in Mattapan noted, \"There's so much that the city of Boston has to offer; it has some of the best colleges and universities, best teaching hospitals and traveling [ health care ].\" Similarly, residents in Chinatown described the close proximity to services as a strength in their neighborhood. One key informant shared, \"One of Chinatown's greatest strengths is that you have access to almost everything you need. You can go to restaurants, you can buy groceries, you can access services, you can get health care . As long as you know what you are looking for, you likely are able to find it in Chinatown. \" Jamaica Plain was described as a neighborhood with ample green space, local business, and accessible transportation. One resident shared, \"In JP we are very lucky to have the pond and the Arboretum. There is good transportation and not a lot of fast food restaurants around. People are able to access primary care services without having to go too far...the neighborhood has a lot going for it.\" Diversity and multiculturalism were seen as strengths across the city. Focus group and interview participants described their communities as \"tight -knit\" . Participants described an engaged community that is willing to help those who are struggling. One focus group participant shared, \" Regardless of the changing face of the community, there is still a real sense of community here . People looking out for each other...and the amount of services and variety of services is just incredible. We hope to keep that ric hness within the community.\" Another key informant echoed this sentiment and shared, \" Every community in Boston has profound assets. We have a strong history of activism, strong connections to diverse communities and cultures, and close proximity to leadin g researchers and thinkers.\" Focus group and interview participants described the strong work ethic and \" will to survive\" as a strength in immigrant communities. Neighborhoods like Chinatown w ere noted as a strong cultural hub by key informants, with one sharing, \"The Chinatown Gate now has an inclusive and well -maintained park, and many tourists from all over the world come to take photos at the Gate; it's become a tourist attraction for a lot of people.\" Residents who identified as LGBTQ indicated that Bo ston is making positive strides related to care for LGTBQ residents and cited Fenway Health and the Justice Resource Institute as strengths. 2019 Community Health Needs Asse ssment 84 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Survey data reinforce many of these themes from qualitative discussions. When Boston CHNA survey respondents were a sked to mark the biggest strengths in their community, a majority of respondents noted \"my community is close to medical services\" (69.0%), \"my community has people of many races (67.5%), \"people speak my language\" (54.8%), good access to resources\" (54.6%) ( Figure 47). Table 13 provides the breakdown of the top five strengths noted among respondents by neighborhood, while Table 14 provides data on this same question by primary language spoken by survey respondent.

Specifically, BPS has made many inroads in this area for LGBTQ students. In the 2017 -2018 school year, out of 74 BPS schools with grades 6 -12 who responded to the School Health Profiles survey, 33 BPS schools repor ted there were Gay Straight Alliances (GSA) in the schools.45 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 88 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Additionally, BPS offers various services and supports for different sub -populations, as reported in the School Health Profiles survey. As shown in Table 15, more than three -quarters of BPS schools offer additional supports for students experiencing trauma, students experiencing homelessness, and English Language Learners. Table 15.

One key informan t described, \"Generally Boston is deeply collaborative; even though there isn't a plan, there is a willingness and appetite to collaborate and pull together in ways that affect the common good.\" However, there is still a need to reduce duplicative services and strengthen collaborations. One key informant summarized, \"Community connectedness matters. The more we are talking to each other, the more success we're going to have.\" Another interviewee echoed this sentiment and added, \"It can feel like an inundati on of services that makes people feel disengaged. Instead we should combine services or be better partners .\" An important next step, suggested key informants, is to fix infrastructure challenges around data sharing. This includes strengthening data reposit ories to interact across systems and tracking health and environmental data. 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 89 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative COMMUNITY HEALTH ISSUES - WHAT IS THE HEAL TH STATUS OF BOSTON RESIDENTS ? Community Perceptions of Health Why is This Important? Understanding the health issues that community resi dents perceive as pressing is a critical step in the CHNA process, providing a \"real life\" perspective lived experiences, challenges, and facilitators around certain issues that complements more quantitative data about health status and conditions. Althoug h not statistically representative, a community member survey such as was conducted for this CHNA is a useful way to obtain directional information from a large number of people. It also fills in gaps on specific topic areas or population groups where limi ted secondary data are available. Finally, understanding what community members see as important can be a first step to garnering the buy -in to programs and services that can be most effective in addressing those needs. Key Findings in this Section Unde rstanding residents' perceptions of health is a critical step in the CHNA process, providing insights into lived experiences, including key health concerns and facilitators and barriers to addressing health conditions. The top community health concerns among Boston CHNA survey respondents were housing quality or affordability (51%) and alcohol /drug abuse (49%), followed by mental health (42%) and community violence (31%) ; these were also top concerns by neighborhood, rac e/ethnicity, age group, gender, and sexual orientation, with the addition of chronic diseases and related behaviors as well as the environment. However, there were some notable statistically significant differences by race/ethnicity and age. Asian responde nts were more likely to identify smoking (37%) and elder/aging health issues (32%), Black respondents were more likely to identify diabetes (35%), Latino respondents were more likely to identify obesity (37%), and White respondents were more likely to iden tify the environment (39%) as one of their top five community health concerns , when compared to other groups. Youth (under 18 years) were more likely to indicate smoking (42%) and employment/job opportunities (32%) as top concerns relative to other age gro ups. For young adults (18-24 years) issues such as hunger/food insecurity (30%) and homelessness (29%) also rose to the top. Respondents 65 years of age and older were significantly more likely to indicate as concerns: elder/aging health issues (50%) and t he environment (38%) compared to younger age groups. Boston CHNA survey results align with themes that emerged from interviews and focus groups; when asked about top health concerns participants also identified mental health and substance use, trauma, comm unity violence, chronic diseases like asthma and obesity, healthy aging, and environmental health concerns. Perceptions of a Healthy Community When asked about top health concerns in Boston, focus group participants and interviewees identified mental healt h and substance use, trauma, community violence, chronic diseases like asthma and obesity, healthy aging, and environmental health concerns as especially concerning. 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 90 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative As discussed in previous sections, key informants described a need for more emphasis on prevention to address these issues. The lack of providers and services \u2014especially that meet the needs of diverse population groups \u2014was noted as a barrier to addressing some of these issues which contribute to extensive wait lists according to participants. As shown in Figure 49, access to health care (65%) and affordable housing (64%) were the first and second leading factors, respectively, that Boston CHNA Survey respond ents identified as important for a healthy community. Access to public transportation (52%) and access to healthy food (51%) emerged as the third and fourth leading factors that res pondents characterized as important for a healthy community. When looking at definitions of a healthy community across Boston neighborhoods ( Table 16), respondents in Chinatown and Hyde Park were more likely to endorse several factors as important for community health. The majority of respondents in Chinatown (82%), East Boston (73%), and Roxbury (72%) identified access to health care as important for community health. Respondents in Chinatown (72%), Jamaica Plain (73%) , and Roxbury (75%) cited affordable housing as an area of importance. R eflecting findings from focus groups (discussed in the Transportation chapter) , a clean environment stood out amongst respondents in Chinatown (43%). Healthy behaviors and lifestyles w ere a priority in the South End (28%). Relative to other neighborhoods, a greater proportion of respondents from Hyde Park cited good roads/infrastructure ( 21%), low level of child abuse ( 11%), and strong sense of community (24%) .

Approximately one -quarter of respondents cited the environment (28%), obesity (25%), homelessness (24%), smoking (22%), and elder/aging health issues (22%) as among the leading concerns. Presented in Table 17 are priority community health concerns that emerged across neighborhoods. Alcohol/drug abuse was the leading concern for respondents in Dorchester, East Boston, Roxbury, and the South End, and was among the top five concerns for respondents in other neighborhoods including Hyde Park and Jamaica Plain. Community violence was the leading concern in Mattapan and was among the top five concerns for respondents in other neighborhoods. Housing qualit y/affordability emerged as the leading concern in Allston/Brighton, Hyde Park, Jamaica Plain, and Roslindale. Homelessness was among the top five priorities in Dorchester, Roxbury, and the South End. The leading concern for respondents in Chinatown was sm oking, followed by chronic conditions. In Allston/Brighton and Roslindale, employment and job opportunities were among the top five priorities for respondents. Hunger and food insecurity w ere among the top five concerns for residents of Roslindale. In Hyde Park, the health of elders and aging -related concerns was among the top five concerns.

For several sub - populations, housing quality or affordability, alcohol/drug abuse, and mental health were among the most frequently selected concerns in their neighborhoods. For Asian respon dents, smoking was most frequently selected as a concern in their community, and similarly for under 18 respondents, smoking was the second most frequently selected concern. Table 19 shows the top five respondents' reported concerns affecting the health of their community by primary language spoken. Consistent with what was seen for the aforementioned sub-populations, housing quality or affordability and alcohol/drug ab use rose up as the top concerns in communities when looking across primary languages spoken. Among Chinese speaking respondents; however, smoking and heart disease/stroke were identified as the top two concerns affecting the health of their communities. 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 97 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Table 18.

Understanding disease and mortality patterns in a population. Death rates help to measure the burden and impact of disease on a population.46 Premature mortality data provide a picture of preventable deaths and point to areas where additional health and public health interventions may be warr anted. Life expectancy at birth measures health status across all age groups and shifts in life expectancy are often used to describe trends in mortality.47 Key Findings in This Section Cancer and heart disease continue d to be the top two leading causes of death in Boston. Accidents was third, where unintentional overdoses accounted for 55% of all deaths due to accidents. For premature death \u2014death among those under 65 years old \u2014accidents w ere the leading cause of premature death for Whites and Latino reside nts, with unintentional opioid overdoses accounting for 70.2% of all deaths due to accidents for Latino residents and 76.7% of all deaths due to accidents for White residents. Homicide was one of the top five leading causes of premature death for Black and Latino residents, while suicide was in the top five leading causes of premature death for White and Asian residents. Leading Causes of Death and Premature Death Cancer and heart disease were the leading causes of death in Boston and have remained so for the last six years ( Table 20). In the most recent years, accidents, which include drug overdoses, has been the third leading cause of death. In 2016, u nintentional opioid overdoses accounted for 55.3% of all deaths due to accidents. Other leading causes of death in the top five are cerebrovascular diseases which includes stroke, and chronic lower respiratory diseases which includes conditions such as chr onic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema complete the top five leading causes of death.

For Asian residents, cerebrovascular diseases, Alz heimer's Disease, and hypertension/renal disease round out the top five leading causes of death. For Black, Latino, and White residents, accidents were the third leading cause of death, with unintentional opioid overdoses accounting for a large part of th ese deaths (40.9% of all deaths due to accidents for Black residents, 66.7% for Latino residents, and 57.2% for White residents). For Black and Latino residents, diabetes was one of the top five leading causes of death. Table 21.

There's a huge difference in paying almost $10 for berries versus $3 for a soda and large bag of chips that'll fil l you.\" \u2014 Key informant interviewee Given that cancer and heart disease are the leading causes of death in Boston and the U.S., it is critical to examine the pervasiveness of their risk factors, such as obesity, nutrition, and physical activity. Obesity is the second leading cause of prevent able death in the United States; currently, about 40% of American adults and 19% of American youth are considered obese.48 Adults who are obese are at increased risk of morbidity from heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer.49 Children who are obese are more likely to have high blood pressure and high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, asthma and sleep a pnea, and suffer from psychological problems such as anxiety and depression.50 The causes of obesity are several and largely preventable including eating healthy food and engaging in physical activity, as well as limiting screen time. Community environment such as availability of healthy food and opportunities for fitness are critical factors - and lack of these resources at the neighborhood and population level follow similar patterns by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status to the inequities seen acros s nearly all other topics. 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 102 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Key Findings in This Section Concerns related to obesity were frequently discussed among focus group and interview participants. More than half of Boston adults and one-third of Boston Public high school students reported being overweight or obese; Black and Latino adults and high school students were more likely to be overweight or obese than White residents or students. The prevalence of obesity and overweight also follows a socioeconomic gradient ; residents who are renters , have lower levels of education, and lower income , were more likely to be obese or overweight compared to their counterparts . Neighborhood level obesity rates also are patterned by racial composition and socioeconomic status in most instances. Mattapan , Hyde Park , Dorchester , West Roxbury, East Boston, and Roslindale have significantly greater proportions of adults who are obese or overweight compared to the rest of Boston . Obesity and Overweight Issues related to overweight and obesity and food insecurity a re intertwined, coupled with the racial and economic inequities that are the drivers for the health disparities seen in the data. Focus group and interview participants discussed these issues as they cited concerns related to affordable and accessible food options for healthy eating and safe open green spaces for exercise, which they viewed as barriers to combating obesity. Childhood obesity was a common theme that emerged among focus group and interview discussions, who linked challenges related to healthy eating with socioeconomic status. Concerns about childhood obesity were especially prominent in focus groups with immigrant parents and with low -income residents from Dorchester. Parents in these groups described challenges affording and accessing healthy food, time constraints, and economic challenges that create barriers for them to provide healthy opportunities for their children. One interviewee shared, \" When your kid is hungry, it's much cheaper to buy a soda and a bag of chips than buy some fr uit. There's a huge difference in paying almost $10 for berries versus $3 for a soda and large bag of chips that'll fill you.\" Other key informants perceived that limited physical activity and increased screen time is exacerbating the issue. One shared, \" When you look at the full picture around obesity it makes sense. You have kids spending the majority of their time in front of a screen, less investments in physical education and health classes, and finally poor eating.\" School nutrition was mentioned in o ne focus; participants in Dorchester perceived that public schools were making positive efforts to enhance nutritional food and provide prevention resources to communities; however, more is needed during school breaks and the summer time. As shown in Figure 51, more than half (57%) of adults across Boston reported being classified as obese or overweight in 2013 -2017. Data in APPENDIX I indicate that the percent of adults who are obese or overweight has remained steady over the last several years. However, rates are different by various population gr oups. Nearly seven in ten Black (68%) and Latino (68%) adults reported being obese or overweight compared with five in ten White (51%) adults across Boston (a statistically significant difference). One-third of Asian adults (34%) reported being obese or ov erweight, significantly lower than the prevalence for White adults (51%). The prevalence of obesity and overweight also follows a socioeconomic gradient, with a significantly higher percent of renters (53% -68%), residents with lower levels of educational attainment (61% -70%), residents with lower income ( 54%-62%), residents out of work (63%) being obese or overweight compared to their counterparts. 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 103 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Figure 51.

Similar to patterns for adults, a significantly higher proportion of Latino (37%) and Black (36%) high school youth reported being obese or overweight than White high school youth (23%). Raci al/ethnic differences in the prevalence of obesity or overweight were similar for males and females. More than one -third of LGBTQ (38%) youth reported being obese or overweight, a proportion that was significantly higher than that of heterosexual or non - transgender youth (32%).

As one focus group parent shared, \" Not everyone is able to afford a $150 for a camp during school vacation.\" Community resources such as the YMCA and Boys and Girls Club were identified as inaccessible to many due to cost. One resident from Dorchester explained, \" The only gym by me is the YMCA, but that is now $30 a month. Who has an extra $30 a month? They say they do it by your income but there's no w ay I can afford that.\" Seniors also expressed challenges affording these resources. One shared, \" I tried to keep up with my monthly fee at the Y but I just can't afford it anymore.\" Focus group participants in Chinatown and Dorchester suggested investing in fitness installations in public spaces such as parks and community centers. Reflecting residents' concerns, a low percent of youth across Boston reported regular exercise. Three in ten (30%) Boston high school youth reported engaging in regular physica l activity in 2013 -2017 ( Figure 54). Among female high school youth, less than one quarter of Asian (17%), Latina (21%), and Black (22%) students engaged in regular phys ical activity, significantly lower than the percent reported among White female youth (37%).

Interviewees perceived an increase in obesity among immigrants and attributed the concerns to American diets, citing easy access to fast food restaurants an d processed foods. One interviewee explained, \" Coming from a country with undernutrition, the change in diet impacts obesity.\" Approximately one in seven Boston CHNA survey respondents reported sometimes choosing fast food because it was cheaper (16%) As s hown in Figure 59, the percent of residents who indicated that they chose fast food because it was cheaper appeared to vary by language use. Three in ten (31%) respondents who primarily spoke Haitian Creole reported selecting fast food on a weekly basis because it was cheaper, followed by two in ten residents who spoke primarily Vietnamese ( 24%) and Spanish (20%).

The higher cost of fresh produce and lack of time for healthy food preparation w ere identified as barriers to healthy eating. One Dorchester resident shared, \" Buying cheap food is not good for your kids but I can't afford Whole Foods.\" Similarly, another resident who identified as low income summarized, \" People work so many jobs that it's very difficult to cook. There's no time so you just work to eat any kind of junk food.\" Some residents in focus groups described a prevalence of convenient stores and fast food restaurants in low -income communities, which many linked to the rise of obesity and diabetes. One parent from Dorchester shared, \"In our neighborhood we have a lot of corner stores full of a bunch of junk foods. If you go to fruit and veggie area s in corner stores...those fruits have often been sitting there a long time and have fruit flies. If you can't make it out to South Bay or Grove Hall, that's what your healthy options are.\" Further, focus group participants from these communities perceived that their neighborhoods had lower quality food compared to more affluent areas of the city. One resident shared, \" The problem is that you can't get quality food unless you leave your community. It feels like the food in our supermarkets [in Dorchester] is what the other stores are not able to sell...the fruit is bad, the meat low qual ity...\" In addition, transportation was cited a barrier to accessing healthy food by a few focus group participants and interviewees. One shared, \"Some places are only accessible by car; folks come to the food pantry and only get things based on what they ca n carry sometimes. Grocery stores accessible by T [stations] are some of the more expensive; so, cost of nutritious and high -quality food is a challenge.\" As shown in Figure 60, more than half of East Boston includes regions where there is not a grocery store within half a mile, as indicated by light blue shading. The neighborhoods of Jamaica Plain, West Roxbury, and Hyde Park, and portions of Roxbury, Mattapan, and Dorch ester are also characterized by sizable geographic areas with limited access to grocery stores. Much of these areas where there is no grocery store also do not include convenience 16.0% 15.1% 112 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative stores, drug stores, or specialty markets. In Dorchester, grocery store acce ss is concentrated in the northern region, with convenience stores and drug stores covering the remaining area where grocery store access is within half a mile of residents. 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 113 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Figure 60. Access to Food Retailers, by Type and Neighbo rhood, 2019 DATA SOURCE: Courtesy of Metropolitan Area Planning Council, 2019 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 114 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Chronic Disease Why is This Important? Chronic disease is both prevalent and costly. Six in ten American adults have a chronic disease and four in ten have two or more. 52 The total costs in the U.S. for direct health care treatment for chronic health conditions totaled $1.1 trillion in 2016 \u2014equivalent to 5.8 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) .53 Although chronic diseases are among the most common and costly he alth problems, they are also among the most preventable through changes in behavior such as reduced use of tobacco and alcohol and improved diet and physical activity. Two of the most preventable chronic diseases, heart disease and diabetes, accounted for an estimated 715,000 deaths in 2016 .54 As seen across other health issues, many chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and asthma disproportionately affect communities of color, lower income individuals, and residents of low resourced neighborh oods, the same groups more likely to experience employment, financial, and housing insecurity. Key Findings in This Section Among focus group and interview participants, d iabetes was frequently mentioned as a community concern that impacts both adults and children, followed by pediatric asthma. While there is a low prevalence of diabetes and asthma in Boston (9% and 11% respectively ), there were significant differences across the population. Black and Latino residents have a higher prevalence of diabetes a nd experience higher diabetes -related hospitalization and death rates than White residents. Similar to diabetes, there were disparities in the distribution of asthma across the population, including by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and neighborhood . Black and Latino adults and children experience significantly higher asthma -related emergency department visits compared to White adults and children. Participants shared that young children living in poverty are disproportionally affected by pediatric a sthma as a result of poor environmental factors and/or poor living conditions including exposure to air pollutants, rodents, mold, tobacco smoke, and lead. Also disproportionately affected by diabetes and asthma are residents of Roxbury and Dorchester, who experience diagnoses and hospitalizations at significantly higher rates than residents in the rest of Boston . Additionally, in 2013 -2017, one -quarter (25%) of Boston adults reported being diagnosed with hypertension, one of the most significant risk facto rs for heart disease and stroke. Diabetes Diabetes was frequently mentioned as a community concern that had an impact on both adults and children. Many focus group and interview participants discuss diabetes in connection with obesity. For example, parti cipants in East Boston explained that stress often triggers unhealthy coping mechanisms such as unhealthy eating that cause illness. One resident shared, \" I work with a lot of women and what I see is a lack of motivation [to exercise]. Moms have to work so much and all of their energy goes to mechanisms to cope like eating poorly; stress often means weight gain.\" Further, key informants perceived the rise in Type 2 Diabetes symptoms among young children \u2014particularly among Black and Latino children . One inte rviewee shared, \" I'm seeing many of our elementary -aged kids exhibiting early signs of Type 2 Diabetes...the darkening ring behind the neck, blurred vison, and frequent urination. Lots of times parents don't realize that these early symptoms are dangerous .\" Lastly, a couple of focus group participants 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 115 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative from Dorchester described challenges affording insulin, sharing that they often skipped doses to make it last longer. While the prevalence of reported diabetes across Boston was 9% in 2013 -2017, the re were significant differences in the distribution of diabetes across the population. Compared to their counterparts, a significantly higher proportion of adults who identified as Black (15%), Latino (12%), older ( >50 years; 16 -23%), Boston Housing Author ity residents (18%), renters receiving rental assistance (17%), adults with a high school education or less (12% -18%), immigrants who have resided in the US for more than 10 years (14%) reported a diabetes diagnosis ( Figure 61).

Black and Latino residents were significantly more likely than White residents to experience a diabetes -related hospitalization, while Asian residents were significantly less likely than White residents to experience a diabetes -related hospitalizatio n.

Similar to patterns for diabetes diagnoses and hospitalizations, the diabetes mortality rate for Black (4 0.7 deaths per 10,000 residents) and Latino (2 8.7 deaths per 10,000 residents) residents was significantly higher than that for White residents (17 .4 deaths per 10,000 residents) in 2016 -2017 (Figure 64).

See APPENDIX I for data. Asthma After diabetes and obesity, pediatric asthma was the most frequently cited chronic concern among focus group participants and key informants, especially for those who lived o r worked in Dorchester, Roxbury, and East Boston. One key informant explained, \"So many of our kids ...are suffering from chronic and active asthma, where they need their inhalers every single day.\" Participants shared that young children living in poverty ar e disproportionality affected by pediatric asthma as a result of poor environmental factors and/or poor living conditions including exposure to air pollutants, rodents, mold, tobacco smoke, and lead. For example, one key informant from Chinatown explained that the neighborhood's proximity to the highway, and poor ventilation systems in older buildings exacerbated asthma rates. One resident shared, \"Asthma rates are high [in Chinatown]. This is related to the prevalence of tobacco use, as well as living cond itions; so many housing developments have pests like rats and cockroaches.\" Further, pediatric asthma was also described as a factor affecting school attendance. Key informants explained that when children are sent home due to asthma concerns, it impedes a parent's ability to maintain stable employment. One interviewee shared, \" It's really hard for parents to pick kids up from school or make meetings, because making meetings means missing work.\" Second hand smoke from tobacco and marijuana were also mention ed as concerns in the home and workplace. For example, an interviewee that worked with children explained , \"We're seeing a trend of increases in asthma; this can go in line with more experiences of second -hand smoke now that marijuana is legalized. A lot o f kids are in cars or homes where marijuana smoke is present.\" 24.0 9.1 *40.7 * 28.7 * 17.4 Boston Asian Black Latino White2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 119 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative In 2013 -2017, across Boston 11% of adults reported a diagnosis of asthma (Figure 65).

The exception to this was in groups in East Boston and Chinatown. In Chinatown, focus grou p participants perceived that the high rates of tobacco use impacted cancer rates in their neighborhood. East Boston participants spoke of cancer in the context of environmental concerns; specifically, residents worried about an electrical plant that was b eing built by the harbor. A few key informants described the need for more supports for caretakers. One shared, \"Family members of a cancer patient likely find it hard to think critically about other matters when they are focused on their loved one struggl ing with such a difficult condition.\" Cancer Screening When discussing cancer screenings, a few interviewees and focus group participants noted that some of the biggest barriers to cancer screenings included lack of awareness about the importance of screen ing, discomfort and fear of screenings particularly those considered more invasive such as colonoscopies, inability to take time off work, confusion about changing screening guidelines, and for a few, insurance and transportation issues. Nearly nine in te n women 50 to 74 years of age across Boston (88%) reported receiving a mammogram in the past two years (Figure 74).

Rates of cancer mortality differed, however, across different subgroups. Across racial/ethnic groups, Black residents experienced significantly higher rates of cancer mortality (181.9 deaths per 100,000 residents) co mpared to White residents. Females (138.5 per 100,000) in Boston had significantly lower cancer mortality rates than males (192.5 per 100,000).

Mental and physical health are intricately connected , and m ental illness is among one of the leading causes of disability in the United States. Suicide, for example, is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States.56 Mental health disorders can affect individuals' mental health treatment, maintenance of physical health, and engagement in health -promoting behaviors.57 People with depression, for example, have an increased risk of cardiov ascular disease, diabetes, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and osteoporosis.58 Social, environmental, and genetic factors across the lifespan, as well as physical health, such as chronic illnesses, are risk factors for mental disorders such as depression and anxiety.59,60 Mental health concerns have substantial economic costs as well : total spending from all public and private sources for mental health and substance use treatment in 2009 was $171.7 billion and is expected to total $280.5 billion in 2020.61 \"We want help, it's not in our community to get help because we were raised... to not talk about what happens in our house; but when we ask for help, you get somebody who clearly does not understand what you're going through.\" \u2014 Focus group participant Key Findings in This Section Mental health issues were described as a priority c oncern across almost all focus group and interviews, and often discussed in connection with trauma and poverty . Stress, anxiety, and depression were the most frequently cited challenges among Boston residents, especially those who identify as LGBTQ, low -income, seniors, children, immigrants, and communities of color. Surveillance and survey data indicate that anxiety and depression are somewhat common across Boston residents, with one in five adult residents reporting that they felt persistent anxiety and o ne in eight reporting persistent sadness . Furthermore, the proportion of residents reporting persistent anxiety has increased over time ; a higher proportion of females, Latinos, lower income individuals, younger, LGBTQ, and unemployed residents reported persistent anxiety than other groups. The age -adjusted suicide rate for Boston is 6.7 deaths per 100,000 residents, with the highest rates occurring among White residents , men, and individuals ages 45 -64. Concern for mental health issues among children an d youth were a prominent theme in focus groups and interviews and this was validated through quantitative data: about one -third of Boston public high school students reported feeling persistent sadness and this has grown substantially over the past few yea rs. The rate of students reporting persistent sadness is even higher among those who identify as Latino , Black, female, and LGBTQ. Nearly one in eight Boston public high school students (12%) has reported seriously considering suicide and 7.6% reported hav ing attempted suicide, with rates for females, Latinos, and those who identify as LGBTQ as higher than for other groups. While statistics indicate that the proportion of people receiving treatment for depression has grown, barriers such as stigma, cultural and linguistic differences, and lack of providers constrain access to services for many residents . 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 140 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Depression and Anxiety Mental health issues were described as a priority concern across almost all focus group and interviews, and often discussed in connec tion with trauma. Stress, anxiety, and depression were the most frequently cited challenges among Boston residents, especially those who belong to underrepresented groups; specific groups that were mentioned include: LGBTQ, low -income residents, seniors, c hildren, immigrants, and communities of color. In conversations, mental health issues were often discussed in relation to social determinant factors such as poverty, employment, and safety. One interviewee summarized, \" Many residents are significantly impa cted by untreated mental health, addiction, and untreated chronic conditions. They are at significant disadvantages in terms of the social determinants of health; communities and families that have multigenerational issues around poverty, lack of education , histories of trauma and violence...\" Additional factors affecting mental health, according to key informants, include d: unstable housing situations; parental incarceration, especially for Black and Latino men; and domestic violence. Immigrants and communities of color were described as especially vulnerable to mental health issues due to limited English language skills, cultural norms, and stigma related to seeking mental health services. In focus groups in East Boston and Chinatown, for example, residents described the need to address issues such as migratory trauma or domestic violence but indicated strong cultural influences at play, with one sharing, \" We don't take care of ourselves emotionally; as Hispanics, it's hard to navigate all of these emotions and ask [for help]. \" Another non-English speaking focus group participant expressed concerns about mental health issues related to unhealthy home situations in immigrant communities, sharing, \" Marriage and divorce are very difficult; there are a lot of people marrying because of necessity, even if it's not the healthiest situation.\" In Dorchester, focus group participants perceived that discussing mental health issues was often taboo in Black communities, with one sharing, \"In the Blac k community we are raised on, 'what goes on in this house stays in this house'; we aren't seeing no therapist. It's something a lot of us were raised with, but it's crippling us.\" Further, undocumented residents were described as especially susceptible to mental health struggles, with one interviewee in the field sharing, \" Immigrant status is a big stressor for many residents \u2014 undocumented residents have been so nervous in the last couple of years with the proposed changes to immigration rules. Folks are dropping out of programs and services because they're afraid.\" Surveill ance and survey data indicate that anxiety and depression are somewhat common across Boston residents. According to the Boston Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BBRFSS), nearly one in eight Boston residents (12.3% ) indicated feeling persistent sa dness in the past 30 days (feeling sad, blue, or depressed for more than 15 days within the past 30 days) (Figure 90). When examining responses by sub -groups, responses w ere significantly higher among Black residents, Latino residents, females, non -home owners, residents with less than some college education, those making less than $50,000 a year, LGBTQ residents, and those not employed compared to the referent in their su b-group (shaded bar).

Additional d ata on persistent sadness and anxiety by various population characteristics can be found in APPENDIX I . Mental health concerns were not just specific to adults. Focus group and interview participants also expressed increasing concern about mental health issues experienced by children and teens. Key informants spoke of how poor social and ec onomic factors exacerbate mental health issues for children; for example, poor children who are at risk of living under chronic stress or experiencing vicarious trauma through their parent's experiences. One interviewee explained, \"Children feed off the st ress of their parents.

Though not as frequently discussed as stress, anxiety was also identified as a common concern for parents and young people who participated i n focus groups. Online bullying and social media were mentioned as components of this anxiety, as well as high -pressures to perform in school. The concern about youth mental health issues is validated by survey data. Responses from the Youth Risk Behavio r Survey indicate approximately 30% of Boston public high school students reported feeling persistent sadness (measured by feeling sad or hopeless every day for 2 weeks or more in the past 12 months) ( Figure 92). When looking at data by specific groups, female students (36.8%) were significantly more likely than male students (23.3%) and students who identify as LGBTQ (48.4%) were significantly more likely than students id entifying as heterosexual/non -transgender (27.1%) to report feeling persistent sadness.

Specifically, focus group participants discussed that they perceived that mental health services were m ore easily available for some communities than others; where they saw gaps or challenges were specifically around services for children, non -English speakers, LGBTQ residents, seniors, and the homeless population.

For example, one key informant explained, \" Mental health is kind of a taboo discussion; the community's willingness to embrace mental health services is an issue.\" Focus group participants \u2014namely in the neighborhoods of Dorchester, Mattapan, Chinatown, and East Boston \u2014described issues of cost and language accessibility that create barriers to mental health access for these populations. Cost for these services was also noted as barrier for middle -income residents with private insurance who do not qualify for financial supports. Middle income seniors were identified as an underserved population, especially for homebound elders who need in -home support. One interviewee summarized, \" People spend down their savings very quickly for in - home [mental health] care.\" Cultural and lingustic differences were described as barriers to mental health utilization for immigrant communities. One interviewee summarized, \" There's a lack of mental health providers in general, and then when you add the cultural competency/language barriers among those providers it's even harder.\" Other key informants explained how non -English speakers had to wait longer to recei ve services, with one sharing, \" The availability of interpreters at medical facilities often delays appointments, whether that is scheduling appointments in advance or the actual starting time of an appointment on the day of. And if an interpreter is not a vailable, the client can have a very difficult time communicating with their physician.\" Focus group participants, namely those from communities of color and immigrant residents, expressed frustration at the lack of mental health providers that reflect th eir lived experiences. For example, mothers who experienced violence in Dorchester explained being offered mental health services from clinicians who they identified as inexperienced and lacking racial awareness. As one focus group participant explained, \"We want help, it's not in our community to get help because we were raised to not talk about what happens in our house; but when we ask for help, you get somebody who clearly does not understand what you're going through. It's not easy to balance.\" Others agreed and added, \"I got a grief counselor who was a White lady in her early 20s, and she keeps telling me 'I understand, it's going to be alright' and in my mind I'm saying, 'You do not understand. Have you ever lost somebody? How can you possibly unders tand what I'm going through?' If you're going to tell me you understand you need to have gone through the same things I have.\" Further, one key informant explained that traditional counseling services may not be the best approach for every population group ; religious minority groups, for example \u2014and it's important to consider tailored approaches for each community : \"Not everyone needs counseling or medicine; it's not easy to find a counselor who can think with you. Sometimes counselors can make things worse if [they] don't understand the basics of your faith.\" Other key informant participants pointed to systemic challenges to addressing community mental health issues. Participants described an insufficient number of providers in the community to meet the de mand, noting long wait lists and limited resources for non -English speakers. Key informants with school -based experience spoke of the need for more full -time emotional supports in the school system, including social workers and counselors in every public s chool. Several key informants also cited larger workforce challenges that compounded these issues, including the struggle to attract and retain a diverse behavioral health work force; these challenges were attributed to low -wages, licensing demands, and co sts of higher education or student debt. Key informants and focus group with parents identified a need for 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 151 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative additional mental health supports within schools and community -based organizations, especially for children who have experienced trauma or community violence. Substance Use Why is This Important? According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), in 2017 about 19.7 million American adults (aged 12 and older) battled a substance use disorder .62 Alcohol abuse disorder is the most common, affecting 14.5 million people (74%). About 38% of adults in 2017 battled an illicit drug use disorder; an estimated 2.1 million people (or 28% of those with an illicit drug use disorder) had an opioid use disorde r. 63 The impact of substance abuse on individuals, families, and communities is tremendous, including poor health, fraying social structures, abuse and neglect of children, and crime and violence. Substance abuse also has substantial economic cost: abuse of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs is estimated to cost American society more than $740 billion annually in lost workplace productivity, health care expenses, and crime.64 Key Findings in This Section \"There is far too little access to treatment pro grams, and those that do exist are not linguistically and culturally competent.\" \u2014Key informant interviewee Substance use was considered a priority health issue in many focus group and interview discussions. Participants mentioned a variety of substances including marijuana, prescription drug use, and opioids as being among the most concerning. Co -occurring mental health and substance use issues were frequently discussed among key informants, as well as the interrelationship between trauma, mental health, and substance use. Smoking among adults and youth, as well as e -cigarette and marijuana use among youth, have significantly decreased in Boston; however, there are significant differences by population groups. Notably, LGBTQ adults and youth are more likel y to use tobacco, e -cigarettes, and marijuana, compared to heterosexual/non -transgender adults and youth; a similar pattern emerged among the LGBTQ population for alcohol consumption and prescription drug use. The majority of focus group participants and k ey informants who discussed substance use as a concern identified opioids as a persistent issue in Boston. The rate of opioid overdose deaths in Boston has significantly increased since 2013 and was highest among Latino residents, followed by White residen ts. Perceptions of Substance Use Substance use was considered a priority health issue in many focus group and interview discussions. Participants mentioned a variety of substances including opioids, marijuana, and prescription drug use as being among the m ost concerning. Co -occurring mental health and substance use issues were frequently discussed among key informants. Additionally, key informant interviewees discussed the interrelationship between trauma, mental health, and substance use. As one interviewe e noted, \"Significant levels of trauma and adverse childhood 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 152 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative events are really huge issues that contribute to a whole host of negative health outcomes, substance use being a big one of them.\" While not mentioned as frequently as opioids, a few focus grou p and interview participants did note that alcohol was a commonly abused substance, especially by those experiencing homelessness. Tobacco use was mentioned as a concern for specific population groups, particularly for those in Chinatown and those who iden tified as homeless. A couple of key informants discussed how older adults are vulnerable to addiction issues; one shared, \"There is also an intergenerational challenge [with substance use] ...a son or daughter's means older folks are now taking care of their grandchildren; that must place a lot of stress on them if they weren't expecting or prepared for it.\" Additionally, some key informant participants shared the perception that law enforcement is increasingly encountering residents with substance use issues and could benefit from additional support and training. Participants were especially concerned about the impact of substance use disorders on young people. In Chinatown, East Boston, and Dorchester, for example, focus group participants perceived an incr ease in youth drug abuse, specifically mentioning marijuana, vaping, and prescription pills like Adderall. Some focus group participants and key informants reported that they believed that providers were over prescribing/diagnosing children, and as a resul t, enabling addictive behavior. For example, interviewees explained that conditions such as ADHD often mimic symptoms that are caused by trauma; there were perceptions that children are being overmedicated for these ailments because the root causes of thei r symptoms were not being addressed. One Roxbury resident who worked with children shared, \" There have been huge increases in ADHD diagnoses \u2014especially in Black and Latino boys. It makes me wonder \u2014 how much of this is really ADHD and how much of these beha vioral issues stem from trauma?\" Likewise, focus group participants in the South End echoed this sentiment, with one sharing, \" A lot of doctors are too quick to medicate; we need to as what brought [children] to this point. If they have depression, they give them medications instead of finding out why this is happening and connecting them to other resources other than medicating t hem.\" Tobacco and Marijuana Use Tobacco use was described as a frequent concern among focus group participants in Chinatown; this was reiterated in the survey results with smoking being the top health concern among Chinatown residents who completed the CHNA survey. Interview participants described the need for more smoking cessation resources, especially for new immigrants and non -English speakers. One shared, \" Smoking remains a challenge in Chinatown. There should be an emphasis on educat ion and support for people who want to know more about smoking and to change their behavior; behavior changes must be a long -term effort.\" Tobacco use was also mentioned as a common occurrence for residents who were housing insecure. One resident who ident ified as chronically homeless shared, \" Everybody smokes in the shelter; it's rare when men don't do it.\" While Boston has seen a statistically significant decrease in smoking since 2010, nearly one in six adults (15.0%) reported being a current smoker in 2 017 ( Figure 104). As noted by focus groups participants, certain neighborhoods have higher rates of smoking. South End (which includes Chinatown) and Dorchester (zip cod es 02122, 02124) have significantly higher rates of smoking than the rest of Boston, with over 20% of their adult populations reporting being a current smoker (Figure 105). 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 153 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Figure 104 .

However, data from the Youth Risk Behavior Risk Survey indicates that the use of e -cigarettes among high school students has significantly decreased, from 14.5% reporting use in 2015 down to 5.1% of high school students reporting any e -cigarette use in the past 30 days (data in APPENDIX I ). Key informants perceived that there were misconceptions of the health risks of vaping, with one sharing, \"Children report that they may have tried vaping because the fruity flavors were enticing, and they did not know there were ot her chemicals involved.\" Others explained how the discreet nature of these devices made it easier for young people to use in places like schools or in public, sharing, \"E-cigarettes are discrete and appear like USB drives; a user can take a puff and put th e device back in their pocket, so one does not always notice them out in public the way we do with cigarettes.\" E-cigarette use among youth does vary by different groups. At 18.3%, LGBTQ youth are significantly more likely to report having used e-cigarettes in the last 30 days than heterosexual or non -transgender youth ( Figure 109). Additionally, White students are significantly more likely than Asian or Black s tudents to use e -cigarettes. Figure 109 .

Those working with young people or in community -based settings described seeing an increase in marijuana use among students and parents in recent years, which they attributed to more social acceptance. However, YRBS data over the last few years indicates that marijuana u se has remained steady since 2011, with approximately one -quarter of Boston high school students reporting current marijuana use (data in APPENDIX I ). Several focus group and interview participants commented on the variety of ways that residents are consuming marijuana, with one interviewee sharing: \"Marijuana used to be simple, something kids would do behind the school; but today there are so many forms of marijuana like brownies and gummy bears, and youth are organizing parties or gatherings to try these things.\" Focus group participants from East Boston, Chinatown, and Allston/Brighton reported concerns for plans to open marijuana dispensaries in their neighborhoods. Those who identified as parents often spoke negatively of marketing campaigns that promoted marijuana use. One resident shared, \"It's very difficult to talk to your kids about marijuana because dispensaries are here and [they are] perv asive .\" Another participant agreed and added, \" It's really rare to find someone who doesn't smoke weed...it's so normal to them. Every day my 11 -year-old has to drive by a billboard in East Boston that says 'Smile, weed is legal.' What kind of example is tha t?\" Key informants discussed the importance of early prevention in elementary and middle schools. One interviewee shared, \" We can't stop [marijuana] use all together, but if we can delay first use as long as possible, that could go a long way to preventing more dangerous addictions as kids get older.\" Quantitative data show that 18.5% of Boston adults reported using marijuana in the past 30 days. Figure 110 provides resp onses to this question by specific population characteristics, revealing that males are significantly more likely than females and LGBTQ adults are significantly more likely than heterosexual/non -transgender adults to report current marijuana use. 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 158 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Figure 110.

Alcohol Use Alcohol use was not discussed as frequently as opioids in focus group and interview discussions, but some participants did comment that, even with all of the concern about opioids, alcohol was st ill a commonly abused substance. This section presents data specifically on binge drinking, while data on heavy drinking (>60 alcoholic drinks for males and >30 for females in past 30 days) can be found in APPENDIX I . The percent of Boston adults reporting binge drinking (having 5 or more drinks on an occasion for men or 4 or more drinks on an occasion for women) has remained steady since 2010, with approximately one -quarter of Boston adult BRFSS respondents reporting this behavior (data over time presented in APPENDIX I ). Figure 112 presents data across different population groups. There are several differences within groups, such as LGBTQ adults (30.5%) are significantly more likely than heterosexual/non -transgender adults (24.0%), males (29.8%) are significantly more likely than fe males (19.8%), and adults earning $50,000 or more (32.5%) are significantly more likely than those earning $25K -<$50K (21.4%) or those earning <$25K (18.5%) to report binge drinking.

While a few key informants indicated that major headway around substance use and the opioid epidemic has been made in recent years, more is needed to address the sever ity of the issue. Several informants indicated that heroin and Fentanyl use was on the rise, and that these substances were cheap and easily available. One key informant shared, \" Heroin is a real health issue; addiction to heroin has been pervasive for dec ades among some communities and populations.\" Some interviewees perceived that opioid use was on the rise in communities of color and cautioned the perception that it is a \"White problem.\" Further, one key informant reported that opioid use was increasing among parents, sharing, \" We're seeing parents abusing drugs like heroin, which then leads to the DCF (Department of Children and Families) involvement and removing of children.\" Focus group from Dorchester, Roxbury, and Chinatown as well as several intervi ew participants reported concerns about used needles littering city streets, playgrounds, and parks across Boston. One resident shared, \" I've lived in Roxbury my whole life and now there are so many needles on the ground.\" Focus group participants in the S outh End echoed these sentiments and shared, \" Kids are walking by and seeing needles everywhere on the ground; we are concerned about children picking them in up in the streets.\" Residents who identified as active substance users acknowledge the problem of used needles across the city and shared that there are groups working to address the problem; however, more resources are needed. One explained, \"Something that the Drug Users Union is trying to do is show that we are responsible users by doing needle cle an ups.

In 2017, Boston high school students were asked if they had ever taken prescription pain med ication without a doctor's prescription or differently than how a doctor told them as shown in Figure 118. While fewer than 10% of Boston high school students reported this, LGBTQ students were significantly more likely - at 18.8% - to report this behavior compared to heterosexual/non -transgender students (7.2%).

Barriers to substance use treatment was discussed by the focus group partici pants in recovery and a few interviewees. These participants discussed the need for more affordable inpatient and outpatient treatment options, especially for non - English speakers. Long -term support services like sober houses were identified as limited and expensive, with one key informant sharing, \" I can get someone into detox, but what we don't have enough us is a place for them to get to the next step [of sobriety].\" Focus group participants in recovery also reported that cost was a barrier to treatment. There was a perception that insurance companies only covered certain substances. One focus group participant from the South End shared, \" You have to be addicted to a certain drug to get help. My insurance only covers help to get clean from heroin.\" Furthe r, the need for culturally -competent treatment options was also discussed as a challenge by key informants. One illustrated these barriers by sharing, \"There is far too little access to treatment programs, and those that do exist are not linguistically and culturally competent.\" For example, shared the interviewee, it was common some cultures to be averse to group approaches to care. One explained, \" Even when the organization convinces a young person to enroll in a treatment program, that young person will leave as soon as they are asked to participate in group -based therapy because that's not something they are culturally comfortable with. If treatment programs had more bilingual and bicultural staff, they would be able to tailor programs to Asian youth and help them actually make progress in their recovery.\" 33.228.426.2 26.036.4 22.4 22.1 19.1 *22.923.8 2014 2015 2016Boston Black Latino Community Health Needs Assessment 169 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Figure 123 shows that in 2017, there were 129.1 unique substance abuse treatment admissions per 10,000 Boston reside nts 12 years old and over, which is significantly lower than the rate of admissions in 2011 (142.4 admissions per 10,000 Boston residents 12 years old and over).

Violence and trauma are important public health issues affecting physical and mental health. People can be exposed to violence in many ways: they may be victims and suffer from premature death or injuries or witness or hear about crime and violence in their community, which can lead to trauma and other mental distress and reduc ed quality of life.65 Children and adolescents exposed to violence may experience behavioral problems, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder or show increased signs of aggression; research has also shown violence and trauma are linked to h ealth conditions such as high blood pressure, worse cardiovascular health, immune deficiency and sleep problems .66 Key Findings in This Section \"It's dangerous to walk around my neighborhood; I could be sitting on my porch and see fights, car accidents ...it's just not a safe neighborhood for kids.\" \u2014 Focus group participant Violence and trauma were frequent concerns reported by focus group and interview participants. Many focus group members expressed concern about personal safety in their communities, with persons of color and children noted to be disproportionately affected . One quarter of respondents to the CHNA community survey described their neighborhoods as unsafe or extremely unsafe. Black and Latino respondents were more likely than other respondents to describe their communities this way. Intimate partner violence wa s mentioned in focus groups and interviews, with women of color and non -English speaking immigrants identifies as particularly vulnerable. Exposure of children and youth to unhealthy relationships and violence (adverse childhood experiences) is also of con cern: nearly one in five Boston adults reported experiencing one adverse experience over their lifetime, and one in six reported more than one. 34.5 33.3 33.530.524.227.3 28.9 020406080100 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 173 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Trauma, poverty and, more recently, fear of deportation and family separation is a growing issue. Bullying among youth in Boston has declined over the past few years, although currently one in ten Boston high school students reported that they have been bullied on school property over the past year or have been bullied electronically. Female and LGBTQ students are disproportionately affected by bullying. Overall Experiences with Violence Across geographies \u2014violence and trauma were frequent concerns reported by focus group and interview participants. Violence can be experienced in many ways \u2014community violence, family violence, partner violence, sexual violence, and interpersonal violence are some of the most common forms. The BBRFSS asked respondents whether they have ever experienced physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. In data aggregated across 2013 -2017, 13% of Boston adults reported experiencing violence in their lifetime ( Figure 128). Respondents who identified as female, 35 -49 years of age, 50 -65 years of age, reside nts of the Boston Housing Authority, renters or tenants receiving housing assistance, and LGBTQ -identified respondents were significantly more likely than their counterparts to report experiencing violence in their lifetime. By comparison, Asian residents, high school graduates, and immigrants living in the US for less than ten years were less likely to report an experience of violence in their life course. However, it should be noted that given the nature of the question, responses may be underreported ove rall and within some population groups. 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 174 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Figure 128 .

English and n on-English speaking residents alike reported concerns about personal safety in their communities. Participants who identified as parents commonly discussed concerns of the impacts of violence on young people. Violence -based trauma emerged as a key health i ssue affecting many population groups, particularly young children and communities of color. Several interview participants expressed the need to better understand how systemic issues such as racism and other forms of oppression impact trauma in communitie s of color. Across all language groups, many focus group participants reported concerns about personal safety in their communities. Key informants and focus group participants specifically mentioned that children and communities of color are disproportiona tely impacted by violence. Other marginalized groups that were mentioned by key informant and focus group assessment participants include: LGBTQ youth \u2014especially those who identify as transgender or non -binary; seniors; and immigrants. Further, community r esidents and interviewees alike stressed that community violence needs to be addressed from a lens of collective trauma. One Dorchester resident shared, \" Our community is suffering from PTSD. We need to heal these wounds...kids have to walk by places where p eople they loved have been killed.\" Some LGBTQ youth who participated in focus groups described their neighborhoods as \" very violent \" with one sharing, \" It's dangerous to walk around my neighborhood; I could be sitting on my porch and see fights, car acci dents...it's just not a safe neighborhood for kids.\" In Chinatown, there was a perception that the proximity to homeless shelters were adding to the violence in the community. One Chinese -speaking focus group participant shared, \" The [homeless] shelters are very close to Chinatown and near the banks. Many residents are afraid to get robbed Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Another focus group participant agreed and added, \" If they moved the homeless shelter that would help lower crime in our community and in the subway stations.\" Focu s group participants and interviewees from Dorchester most frequently cited concerns about increasing gun violence in their communities. One key informant explained, \" A lot of families are experiencing sudden death because of gun violence; it's traumatizi ng and de -stabilizing to the community .\" Some residents in East Boston reported a decrease in violence in recent years; still, East Boston was described as an area that needed more violence prevention supports. In Mattapan, Haitian focus group participant s perceived that more Haitian youth were involved in gangs and the criminal justice system. One participant shared, \" Social delinquency was less in the Haitian community; now there are a lot of young Haitian men in prison.\" Other participants agreed with this sentiment and added that certain neighborhoods like Mattapan have reputations for community violence. \" Mattapan has the nickname MurderPan...even some newspapers call it that.\" When Boston CHNA survey respondents were asked how safe from crime they consi dered their neighborhood to be, 25% described their neighborhood as unsafe or extremely unsafe. Survey respondents who identified as Black (40%) or Latino (37%), respondents with some college or a certificate program (39%), and parents of children younger than 18 years of age (32%) were more likely to characterize their neighborhoods as unsafe or extremely unsafe ( Figure 130).

Overall, CHNA survey respondents who identified as Latino, younger respondents, parents of young children, and respondents with less than a college education were more likely to report as a s erious problem feeling unsafe while alone on their street at night. Additionally, female respondents were more likely than male respondents to cite feeling unsafe while alone on their street at night as a minor or serious . Boston CHNA survey respondents f rom Roxbury (31%), Dorchester (28%) were more likely than residents in other neighborhoods to report feeling unsafe when alone in their street at night as a serious problem. Respondents from Mattapan (43%) and Dorchester (36%) were more likely to cite guns hots in their neighborhood over the past year as a serious problem compared to respondents in other Boston neighborhoods.

There were mixed perceptions of relations with law enforcement among focus group and interview participant s. Some interviewees and focus group participants \u2014namely those from communities of color \u2014perceived that their communities were being overpoliced. One key informant summarized, \"There is a history of over policing and police violence among people of color i n [Boston].\" Further, some key informants spoke of the increase of anti -police sentiments across the country and perceived that these sentiments made positive community -police relations a challenge. Focus group participants in East Boston reported an incre ase in law enforcement presence in their neighborhood, which they mentioned as a strength and some attributed to declining levels of violence. They shared, \" There used to be a lot of violence in the community, but it has been better in the last two years. The police have been doing sweeps in the neighborhoods and have caught a lot of people, mainly adolescents.\" On the contrary, key informants representing Chinatown perceived a decrease presence of law enforcement, one sharing, \" There are not as many BPD of ficers walking through the [Chinatown] community on food as there use to be, interacting face -to-face with community members. Now, officers tend to drive around instead of walking...\" It was noted by some key informants that the Boston Police Department has made positive strides to improve community relations by focusing on youth engagement, hosting community dialogues, and strengthening partnerships across sectors. Interpersonal and Domestic Violence The prevalence of interpersonal violence \u2014a pattern or beh avioral used to establish power and control over another person through fear and intimidation, often including the threat or use of violence \u2014was discussed by a few key informants and by some focus group participants from 3.8 NA 2.2 NA NA NA 30.1 * 9.1* 0.6Boston Asian females Black females Latina females White females Asian males Black males Latino males White males2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 181 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Chinatown, East Boston, and Mattapa n. One key informant explained, \" There are plenty of families who are dealing with abusive relationships...there is evidence of abuse, domestic violence, drug addiction.\" Women of color and non -English speaking immigrants were identified as especially vulner able to interpersonal and domestic violence due to cultural or linguistic barriers. One resident from Mattapan shared, \" Sometimes in the Haitian community, we are scared to address abuse. There needs to be more education about women's rights to address domestic violence; not only the physical, but the verbal and mental.\" The need for more service providers who were bi -lingual was described as a priority among these groups. One key informant explained, \" [I] would like to see [ health care institutions] to employ more Asian people, especially immigrants and bilingual people, not only as medical providers, but as administrative and other staff, like custodians, greeters, accountants, security personnel, food service workers, technicians, etc .\" Further, there was a perception that it was common for young people to be exposed to unhealthy relationships. One key informant shared, \" Men are seen as having dominion over their home and family, and women are expected to defer to his wishes and seek h is permission to do certain things; youth today see that and therefore believe it's right for men to be in charge and for women to obey. This is why dating violence and domestic violence continues to be a challenge in Chinatown, and why it's not considered a big deal .\" Another non -English focus group participant in East Boston expressed concerns related to domestic violence in immigrant communities, sharing, \" Marriage and divorce are very difficult - there are a lot of people marrying because of necessity, e ven if it's not the healthiest situation.\" There is very little quantitative data available on interpersonal or domestic violence. In 2018, the Boston Police Department served a total of 1,921 restraining orders. Table 25 shows the distribution of these by neighborhood. Table 25.

One key informant summarized, \"You have 1st graders showing up to school hungry, sometimes experience violence in the home; students apologizing for being late because there was a killing and their street was on lock down. They're dysregulated and traumatized.\" There was a p erception among key informants and focus group participants who identified as parents that there is a lack of resources for children who have experienced traumatic events. This was especially prominent in focus groups in Dorchester, who cited inequitable s ocial emotional supports in lower income schools of color. One shared, \"We need for therapy is schools. When the marathon bomb happened, they blocked off all the streets until they caught him and after, all those kids got counseling. But that type of respo nse only happens when you're in White schools. Even when the student was shot in front of the [Dorchester] high school in front of hundreds of students they didn't bring in any therapists and kids are walking by the scene every single day being reminded of it.\" In 2017, nearly one in five Boston adults reported experiencing one adverse childhood experience (19%) over their life time ( Figure 136). Nearly one in six Boston residents reported more than one adverse childhood experience (16%). Figure 136 .

Different facets o f trauma were described by assessment participants. For example, some key informants discussed the trauma of poverty that results in chronic stress and post -traumatic stress disorder. The topic of intergenerational trauma was also described as a concern by key informants with experience in early childhood education. These interviewees explained that trauma is cyclical, with one sharing , \"trauma is generational; parents and their parents before them are living in unstable housing, are being evicted...\". Furthe r, numerous key informants mentioned the trauma experienced by immigrant children and their families, and cited fear of deportation and family separation. A common theme that emerged in focus group and interviews was the need to integrate more trauma -infor med care in health services and early childhood education. Focus group participants who identified as survivors of violence expressed the need for more accessible services, sharing , \"We need trauma -informed classes that are in our neighborhoods [Dorchester ]. I want my kids to know that their feelings are valid and real...that it's okay to be scared.\" Suggestions were made by key informants to invest in community -driven solutions that meaningfully engage young people. According to key informants, meaningful en gagement of youth needs to happen on a structural level, one sharing: \" We need to talk to young Latino White Female Male LGBTQ Heterosexual/non-transgender2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 190 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative There are times that we consider meaningful youth engagement where we let them pick the color of a t -shirt. If we want to meaningfully engage youth in a nti-violence work, we need to hold meetings at times when they're available, pay them for their expertise, and commit resources for them in our budgets.\" Widening the trauma -informed care lens by focusing on familial responses to trauma emerged as a theme from key informant interviews. Other suggestions included strengthening the foundation of trust with community residents by addressing trauma from a commu nity-driven, grassroots, perspective. One key informant shared, \"We need to get people involved in in the process of developing strategies to address trauma, using the consumer model of asking people what they need; approaching one household at a time.\" There were also suggestions to expand neighborhood trauma teams and strengthen partnerships that bring interdisciplinary groups together. One interviewee suggested creating a community review board before implementing new initiatives, a \" population version o f an IRB [institutional review board].\" Institutional Racism Institutional racism \u2014or the systematic distribution of resources, power, and opportunity in our society to the benefit of people who are White and the exclusion of people of color \u2014was described as a priority by several key informants and focus group participants. As one interviewee summarized, \" We see things in communities of color like over policing, greater system involvement, more suspensions, the school to prison pipeline...racism sho ws up in all of these insidious ways.\" Similarly, one focus group participant in Dorchester shared, \" If the rules are made by White people for White people, it doesn't matter who is elected to represent us; nothing will change for us [Black residents].\" Key informants identified a need for more structural commitments to anti -racism work including investments in staff training, sharing, \" We need to make anti -racism work part of what we do...it matters. We need to have all levels of folks engaging in these con versations.\" One example that was identified as a meaningful structural commitment to anti -racism was the Boston Public Health Commission's mandatory anti -racism training for employees. One key informant shared, \"I think we continue to need an honest recko ning with the impact that systems -based violence and racism going on; accepting the personal roles we play as White people. I don't think we have the tools or resources to address system -based violence and racism in a real and concrete actionable way.\" Ma ternal and Child Health Why is This Important? The health and well -being of mothers, infants, and children are important indicators of community health. Their well -being determines the health of the next generation and can help predict future public healt h challenges for families, communities, and the health care system.67 Understanding the current status of and disparities within infant mortality rates, low birthweight and preterm births, and access to prenatal care, is important to predict infant survival , child development, and well -being as well as potential health care resources needed and costs of care.68 Infants born prematurely, for example, are at risk for neurological disabilities, respiratory conditions, or developmental delays.69 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 191 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Key Findings in This Section \"People are always working and giving all of their money to child care. I'm working my life away to pay someone else to take care of my children.\" \u2014 Focus group participant Quantitative data indicate that the overall birth rate in Boston has significantly declined for women 15 -44 years old since 2011 to 41.6 births per 1,000 female residents in 2017. However, current birth rates are significantly different by neighborhood wi th Hyde Park, Charlestown, Roslindale, Mattapan, East Boston, Dorchester, and West Roxbury were neighborhoods having significantly higher birth rates. Relative to other cities in the United States, rates of infant mortality are low and have been relatively stable over time but are higher in some neighborhoods. Rates of infants with low birthweight and preterm births \u2014both important risk factors for infants \u2014are less than 10% and have generally remained steady from 2011 -2017. However, rates for both are signif icantly higher among Black and Latino mothers. Smoking among pregnant women, another risk factor for poorer birth outcomes, has also declined in recent years. Access to prenatal care has improved over time, and currently more than eight in ten mothers in B oston receive adequate or adequate plus prenatal care. However, Asian, Black, and Latino mothers are significantly less likely than White mothers to receive adequate or adequate plus prenatal care. Focus group members and interviewees tended to discuss mat ernal and child health in the context of economics and parenting concerns. Childcare was frequently discussed, with expensive or inconvenient childcare, long waitlists, and lack of summer childcare as primary issues. Difficulty paying for childcare was als o an issue for respondents to the Boston CHNA community survey. Perceptions of Parenting and Child Health It was not common for focus group or interview participants to name maternal or child health conditions, per se, as a top concern. Instead, discussions around this topic centered on the economic concerns about raising a family, financial costs of child car e, and appropriate parent practices. Mothers from East Boston who participated in focus groups specifically described the challenging demands of raising children and reported that some women are pressured to conceive even if it is not in their best intere st. One participant shared, \"I know a woman who has 3 kids and is barely able to get by, but her husband wants more kids and she doesn't. It's easy for them to say but it's not their lives and body they're sacrificing.\" A common theme that emerged among focus group with parents \u2014many of whom identified as single mothers \u2014was the need for more supports to learn positive parenting skills. Some attributed the demands of working long hours as interfering with a parent's ability to spend quality time with their children. Participants indicated that lack of time often results in behavioral issues in children. One parent summarized, \" Families are so focused on working to provide for their kids, but what kids really need is time with their parents.\" Discipline pra ctices were also discussed in focus group groups, with some participants indicating that cultural norms in parenting differ among population groups. For example, focus group participants in Dorchester expressed the need to break generational practices that some perceived as detrimental to children. One shared, \" Everything I learned as a parent I learned 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 192 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative from other women and it wasn't always right. Now I'm finally figure out how to be a good parent but my youngest is 16 now. They're gone through so much stuf f before I figured out what it means to be a good parent.\" Immigrant parents in East Boston, Mattapan, and Allston/Brighton described cultural differences in parenting between generations that they perceived as often creating tension between children and p arents. One focus group participant shared, \" We come from different cultures and in America it's different. American culture doesn't emphasize respecting elders or devotion to the group; it's all about the individual doing whatever they want with no conseq uence.\" Another parent agreed and expanded, \"We would have never spoken to our parents the way our kids speak to us; my daughter says she's just expressing herself, but that behavior is not okay in my country.\" Access and Barriers to Childcare Surveillance data on the availability and access to child care are scant in Boston. To address this gap, the City of Boston is in the process of collecting data through an optional survey on the 2019 city census on residents' language, disability access, child status, and current situation and barriers to child care for children five years old and younger. For low -income working families, the cost of childcare was described as a substantial barrier to financial security and employment opportunities, especially for sin gle parents. One interviewee summarized, \" The availability and affordability of childcare, especially for single parents where the vast majority are female -headed households, is almost impossible.\" Focus group participants in East Boston and Dorchester des cribed the need to work multiple jobs in order to afford childcare, which impacted their ability to be an engaged in their child's life. One mother explained , \"People are always working and giving all of their money to child care. I'm working my life away to pay someone else to take care of my children.\" Key informants reported that children ages 0 -5 were especially vulnerable to the long -standing impacts of poverty. One shared, \" Young children 0 -5 are the most vulnerable in the city. With [poverty] comes trauma related issues just by virtue of their families being in a low - or lower -income status.\" Among Boston CHNA survey respondents, nearly one -quarter (23.1%) of parents of children under 18 years old indicated that they had trouble paying for child care . Unaffordable and inconvenient childcare was mentioned as a significant concern amongst focus group participants. As one focus group participant remarked, \"People are always working and giving all of their money to child care. I'm working my life away to pay someone else to take care of my children,\" a sentiment felt by many participants. The cost of child care was a major financial challenge for parents. However, not only was cost identified as a barrier for parents, but key informants also described lon g waitlists for childcare, especially for younger children who are under the age of 3 years old. Key informants who identified as parents also expressed that childcare was especially difficult during the summer time and on school breaks. One shared, \" [Chil dcare especially bad in the summertime. I want my grandkid to be able to go to the Boys and Girls Club to be with other kids, but even that is $200 a week; I barely make that much.\" Additionally, focus group participants who identified as grandparents in Dorchester frequently spoke of needing to help their children with childcare, often causing them to miss work. One resident shared, \"I have to watch my grandson because every Friday it's a half a day at school, and every month or so there's a day when the y don't go. My daughter is trying to work to make a life for herself but how 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 193 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative can she when she has to leave to get him at school in the middle of the day? So, I'm trying to help my daughter by taking care of him at those times, but it means that I can't wor k.\" Survey data confirm these themes. Of the Boston CHNA survey respondents, almost 11% indicated that they had trouble paying for child care . Data by race/ethnicity show that 16% of Latino respondents and 14% of Black respondents report trouble paying for child care (Figure 148). While the numbers were generally small in the survey among some non -English speakers so results should be interpreted with caution, Figure 149 indicates that Haitian Cr eole, Portuguese, and Spanish speakers were significantly more likely than the rest of the sample to indicate having trouble paying for child care.

Data can be found in the APPENDIX I . However, current birth rates are significantly different by neighborhood. Hyde Park, Charlestown, Roslindale, Mattapan, East Boston, Dorchester, and West Roxbury were neighborhoods with significantly higher birth rates in 2017 compared to the rest of Boston (Figure 150). Additional data on birth rates by race/ethnicity and age group can be found in APPENDIX I . Figure 150 .

The percentage of babies born low birth weight or preterm have generally remained steady from 2011 -2017 (data in APPENDIX I CHNA -CHIP Collaborative 2017, 8.7% of babies born in Boston were born low birthweight and 9.9% were considered preterm. For both low birth weight and pre term births, rates were significantly higher among Black and Latino mothers ( Figure 151).

The percentage of mothers in Boston who reported smoking during pregnancy has significantly decreased over time from 2.2% in 2011 to 1.5% of mothers in 2017 ( Figure 152). However, among mothers who do report smoking during pregnancy, it is significantly more likely among those in their 20s compared to those who are 35+ years old, White moth ers compared to Latino and Asian mothers ( Figure 153), and those living in Dorchester or Roxbury compared to the rest of Boston (Figur e 154).

One health issue where data are regularly collected is around lead exposure. In 2011, 3.9% of boys under 6 years old were screened with elevated blood lead levels, while that figure was 2.4% in 2015 ( Figure 158). For girls, 3.0% who were screened had high blood levels; in 2015, that number was 2.2%. Figure 158 .

Specifically, they talked about the possibility of lead paint in older houses and its potential health effects. As one parent shared, \" Lead in the house worries me; this neighborhood has a lot of old houses and people don't know that lead is ve ry dangerous.\" A few also commented on concerns of lead in the water in older school buildings. Sexual Health Why is This Important? Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remain a significant public health problem in the United States, despite the fact t hat they are preventable. Each year, there are approximately 20 million new STIs \u2014about half of them among young men and women.70 While most will not cause harm, some have the potential for serious health consequences including chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis and human papillomavirus (HPV). STIs are also costly, accounting for about $16 -CHIP Collaborative \"[There is a] need for more access to positive sexual health education. Parents don't feel comfortable discussing sex, so kids' only exposure is media, where the emphasis is on physical gratification, not on developing positive, respectful relationships with a partner.\" \u2014 Key informant interviewee Key Findings in this Section While sexual health was not a prominent theme discussed across focus groups or interviews; the Youth Risk Behavioral Survey provides helpful insights into sexual behaviors among youth, such as condom use, to inform STI prevention strategies. This is partic ularly important given that residents age 15 -24 experienced the highest rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea. Boston has experienced a significant increase in cases of chlamydia and gonorrhea over time with disparities by neighborhood, age, and sex. While the incidence of HIV among Boston residents has decreased over time, disparities persist by neighborhood, race/ethnicity, age, and sex. Youth Sexual Activity Sexual health was not a prominent theme discussed across focus groups or interviews; however, a few ke y informants with expertise in the field of substance use and early childhood care expressed the need for more sexual health education as early as late elementary and middle school. They described concerns related to social media use and the impacts of unhealthy relationship models. According to 2013 -2017 Youth Risk Behavioral Survey results, 44% of Boston public high school students reported ever having sex and 62% of sexually active Boston public high school students used a condom during the last time t hey had sex. About half of Latino and Black students had ever had sex (52% and 48%, respectively), which was significantly higher than White students (33%). Latino and Black students were also twice as likely to report having sex before age 13. Nearly two -thirds of students who identified as LGBTQ had ever had sex, which was significantly higher than students who identified as heterosexual/non -transgender 41%); LGBTQ students were also more likely to report having sex before age 13 compared to heterosexual or non -transgender students. (See APPENDIX I for additional data on youth sexual behavior.) LGBTQ youth focus group participants perceived that sex work among LGBTQ young people was on the rise, especially for those who were housing insecure or homeless. One LGBTQ youth focus group participant expressed that the practice of sex work is sometimes normalized, which they described as detrimental to young people. \"I spent time as a prostitute and there was little sympathy for me in the older [LGBTQ] community; I don't think that these behaviors should be passed off [as normal].\" Chlamydia From 2015 t o 2017, Boston experienced a 21% increase in chlamydia from 638 to 772.5 cases per 100,000 residents. As shown below in Figure 160, Dorchester (02121, 02125) had the highest rate of chlamydia (1,310.0 cases per 100,000 residents) - 1.5 times the rate of the rest of Boston - followed by Roxbury and Dorchester (02122, 02124) (1,070.5 and 1,068.5 cases per 100,000 residents, respectively). Younger residents experienced signi ficantly higher rates of chlamydia compared to residents 40 years and over (161.2 cases per 100,000 residents); those 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 201 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative aged 15 -24 years had the highest rate of chlamydia (1,737.8 cases per 100,000 residents). Females had a significantly higher rate of chlam ydia compared to males (833.3 and 721.3 cases per 100,000 residents, respectively). See APPENDIX I for additional data. Figure 160 .

Females had a significantly lower rate of gonorrhea compared to males (114.7 and 394.9 cases per 100,000 residents, respectively). See APPENDIX I for additional data . HIV/AIDS While the incidence of HIV among Boston residents has decreased over time - from 28.7 to 21.8 new diagnoses per 100,000 re sidents - between 2014 -2017, disparities exist by neighborhood, race/ethnicity, age, and sex. In 2017, Mattapan and Roxbury residents experienced the highest HIV incidence rates (45.0 and 40.1 new HIV diagnoses per 100,000 residents, respectively) across a ll neighborhoods in Boston ( 202 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Figure 161.

In 2017, nearly half of new HIV diagnoses occurred among men who have sex with men (48%), 31% of new diagnoses were from an unknown mode of transmission, 13% were through presumed heterosexual sex, and 8% were from injection drug use. Some participants in the focus group with residents in recovery or active users perceived an increase in HIV in the community, attri buting the increase to needle -sharing and unprotected sex. One resident shared, \" People using that have HIV aren't getting help; they're sharing needles and passing the [disease] around/ People are playing Russian Roulette and don't realize what they're gi ving and getting.\" Another resident agreed and added that the perceived rise in methamphetamines were also a factor, sharing, \" There's an increase in the amount of people getting HIV because of the crystal meth; it keeps you up for days and people fall in love with it.

It's right by the highway. Think, they are just breathing in all those highway fumes every day...\" \u2014 Key informant interviewee A healthy environment is associated with a high quality of life and good health. Environmental factors are various and far reaching and include exposure for hazardous substances in the air, water, soil or food; natural disasters and climate change; occupational hazards; and the built environment .72,73 An unhealthy environment exacerbates issues of health, illness, injury, and behavior. Hazardous substances in the air and water are connected to health concerns such as cancer and long -term damage to respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Extreme he at, natural disasters such as floods, droughts and storms can cause physical harm, as well as the spread of pollutants, hazardous substances, and communicable diseases.74 They also spread environmental health hazards from fires/explosions, toxins, and pollutions. Features of the built environment influence behaviors, physical activity patterns, social networks, and access to resources. Poor environmental quality has its gr eatest impact on people whose health status is already at risk. 75 Key Findings in This Section Concerns related to environmental health were raised across the survey, focus groups, and interviews. Boston CHNA survey respondents cited their top environment al health concerns as: outdoor noise pollution from vehicles, outdoor air pollution from vehicles, and dangerous traffic. Overall, these top three concerns were similar across neighborhoods, except for East Boston which cited airport noise as a top concern . Air pollution and quality was a concern discussed in focus groups in Chinatown and East Boston where residents perceived that lower - income neighborhoods were more vulnerable to pollutants and litter due to proximity to highways, airports, and train stati ons. BBRFSS data show secondhand smoke exposure was significantly higher among Boston residents of color and lower socioeconomic status . Multiple key informants explained how more extreme weather, heat , and rising seas from climate change are increasing h ealth problems, particularly for mental health, respiratory, cardiovascular and vector -borne disease. Boston emergency department utilization rates and costs for climate -driven health issues are expected to rise in the future . Community health and resilien ce efforts can reduce such threats and costs, and help the city prepare for Climate Ready Boston's estimate that 7% of our land will experience frequent storm water flooding by 2050. 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 206 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Environmental Health Concerns and Experiences Boston CHNA survey respond ents noted a number of different environmental health concerns and whether they experienced any of these concerns at home, work, or school. Among all the issues listed, outdoor noise pollution from vehicles (39.8%), outdoor air pollution from vehicles (38.9%), and dangerous traffic (35.6%) were the top three cited environmental health concerns around a respondent's home ( Table 26). Additionally, approximately one -quarter of respondents cited extreme outdoor heat or cold, mold/mildew or water leaks, bug and/or rodent infestation, and more severe storms as top environmental health concerns at home. At work, the top three concerns were similar but in a different order; dange rous traffic was the most cited environmental health concern with 31.4% reporting this. At respondents' school (if applicable), dangerous traffic, outdoor air pollution from vehicles, inadequate heating or cooling, and outdoor noise pollution from vehicles were the top concerns reported.

East Boston residents' top environmental concern at home was airport or airplane noise or 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 207 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative vibrations, while Mattapan residents cited mold or mildew leaks as a top environmental health concern at home. When citing environmental health concerns at work, re sponses were generally similar by respondents' neighborhood of residence, except that Chinatown residents cited tobacco smoke in their top issues ( Table 28 ). When noting top environmental health concerns at school, responses by neighborhood of residence overall mirrored the general sample, except that Hyde Park residents cited bug and/or rodent in festation as their top environmental health issue at school, Roslindale residents cited inadequate heating and/or cooling, and Chinatown residents cited tobacco smoke as their second biggest environmental health concern at school ( Table 29). (However, it should be noted that the survey did not ask for respondents' area of work or school.) 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 208 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Table 27.

More than one in ten Boston adults reported exposure to secondhand smoke in the BBRFSS questionnaire (Figure 166). Respondents who identified as Asian, Black, or Latino were all significantly more likely than White respondents to report exposure to secondhand smoke. By housing status, non - homeowners were more likely than homeowners to indicate being exposed to secon dhand smoke, with more than 20% of Boston Housing Authority residents and renters on rental assistance reporting exposure. It should be noted that in 2012, Boston Housing Authority was among the first large housing authorities in the country to implement a portfolio -wide non - smoking policy. Lower income and unemployed were significantly more likely than their higher income and employed counterparts to report secondhand smoke exposure. Figure 166 .

These hazards could be in a variety of settings, including private residences, public buildings, workplaces, and outdoor spaces. For 2012 -2016, among the inquiries or complaints received, a total of 432 hazards/violations were identified for mold in Boston. Figure 167 shows t he number of hazards/violations by neighborhood rang ing from 9 in Charlestown to 59 in Dorchester (zip codes 0212 1, 02125) . Figure 167 .

Residents perceived that lower -income neighborhoods were more vulnerable to pollutants and litter due to proximity to highways, airports, and tra in stations. As one key informant noted, \"You see those kids playing basketball every day at the Wang Center (YMCA in Chinatown). It's right by the highway. Think, they are just breathing in all those highway fumes every day. I wonder if years from now wha t the health effects are going to be. They are trying to get some physical activity playing basketball but end up with worse health because the pollution.\" East Boston residents reported significant concerns of the addition of an electrical plant in the neighborhood, which they feared would increase cancer rates and respiratory issues. One resident shared, \"The electricity plant is coming and it's going to make us all sick, my kids will grow up breathing poison.\" Another participant agreed and added , \"Why d o they always build the bad in this neighborhood [East Boston]?\" Air quality was also mentioned in the context of marijuana use in public spaces. Focus group participants in Allston/Brighton, Chinatown, and East Boston frequently mentioned concerns over the legalization of marijuana and the perception that the substance is easily accessible and 34 28 959 58 26 161323 24 1658 2131 112019 Community Health Needs Assessment 213 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative often consumed in public spaces, polluting the air around them. One parent shared, \"The park near my house where I take my daughter \u2014there's a lot of people smoking marijuana all the time.\" Another resident agreed and added, \" Where I live, the people smoke marijuana inside. The smoke makes me choke, my children vomit...but it's legal [so] what can I do?\" As noted in the 2016 -2016 Health of Boston report, data from the five Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) sites located in Boston that monitor particulate matter indicated that there were no years between 2005 -2015 when the particulate concentrations exceeded the annual standard set forth by t he U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).76 Extreme heat is an additional environmental health concern. Figure 168 shows that for 2016 - 2017 data combi ned, the age -adjusted rate per 100,000 residents for heat -related emergency department visits during warm weather months (May -September) was 6.2 visits per 100,000 residents , although men (7.9 visits per 100,000 residents ) had significantly higher rates th an women (4.8 visits per 100,000 residents ). Residents 18 -44 years old had significantly lower heat-related ED rates (4.5 visits per 100,000 residents) than residents who were 65+ years old (9.5 visits per 100,000 residents) ( Figure 168).

Emerging analysis is expected to show Boston emergency department utilization rates and costs for climate -driven health issues are rising. Interviewees identified the need for a climate -informed emergency preparedness str ategy for the city of Boston to address flooding and major heat related -events in the immediate future. One key informant explained, \"We need to draw better connection on the vulnerable populations (outlined by Climate Ready Boston) and emergency response system that targets those neighborhoods so that 6.2 NA 9.8 7.0 6.7 4.8* 7.9 NA 4.5* 9.3 9.5Boston Asian Black Latino White Female Male Under 18 years 18-44 years 45-64 years 65+ years2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 214 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative people can get advance notice of when this flooding happens - this area has not really been explored yet...\" Key informants described that it is imperative to address climate change through a coordinated and sy stemic approach. One key informant summarized, \"It will be important to mobilize partnerships to address the severity of environmental issues. Hospitals, public health organizations, and others can collaborate to overlay the Climate Ready Boston assessment to prepare high -risk neighborhoods.\" Climate change was also discussed in the context of mental health. Key informants described how climate -related triggers like heat waves can agitate mental health stressors. One key informant shared, \" Acute psychiatri c care has grown enormously. There are ties between mental health issues and climate change that need to be addressed. There can be 5 -7 day waits for a bed for those who acute psychiatric needs, and we are seeing more of these that are aggravated by climat e change pathways.\" Key informants described the need to mitigate the impacts of climate change by thinking creatively about urban planning and development. Specific strategies mentioned include: reducing asphalt, increasing tree coverage, and ensuring roo fs are painted white instead of black. Further, key informants explained that it will be imperative for the city to work with real estate development companies that are committed to long -term strategies to address environmental concern as development incre ases. The Climate Ready Boston report discusses projections of climate change's implications on Boston neighborhoods, with particular attention to the effect of extreme temperatures, rising sea levels, extreme precipitation, and storm flooding. Eight area s of Boston that are identified as some of the most vulnerable , particularly for coastal and river flooding, include Charlestown, Charles River, Dorchester, Downtown, East Boston, Roxbury, South Boston and the South End.77 As reported in the Climate Ready B oston Report, Boston's land area exposed to stormwater flooding is projected to increase steadily. By the 2050s, it is projected that 7% of Boston's land area could be exposed to frequent stormwater flooding from 10 -year, 24 -hour rain events (Table 30). West Roxbury, Allston, Brighton, East Boston, and South Dorchester have the largest areas of land expected to be affected by stormwater flooding, while the South End and South Boston can expect to see the greatest increase in land area exposed to stormwater flooding as sea levels rise and precipitation events become more extreme. Table 30. Percent Land Area Acres Predicted to be Exposed to Stormwater Flooding For the 10 -Year 24 -Hour Event, by Boston and Neighborhood Total Area Acres 2030s Needs Assessment Total 11% 12% 15% DATA SOURCE: City of Boston, Climate Ready Boston Final Report, 2016 NOTE: A 10 -Year 24 -Hour Storm is a common measure of major rain and snow events that refers to the amount of precipitation that has at most a one in ten annual chance of falling during a 24 -hour period; Data are based on current available land. Any change to the landscape from present conditions, such as subsidence or land loss as a result of sea level rise, are not taken into consideration. Key informant interviewees specifically identified the need for a centralized data repository to collect real -time data related to environmental health issues including climate chan ge. This would include data like emergency department utilization during high heat days. (However, it should be noted that for the past 15 years Boston has had a Syndromic Surveillance System in place \u2014a data system for early detection of outbreaks to monit or the size, spread, and tempo of any outbreaks \u2014with every emergency department reporting daily) . Interviewees also noted that more guidance is needed around evidence -based strategies to address climate change for those disproportionally impacted, like chi ldren, seniors, and low -income communities. There were suggestions to build from the work being led by local coalitions and city initiatives like Climate Ready Boston. Specific groups that were mentioned as potential partners include: Health Care Without H arm, A Better City, Metropolitan Area Planning Council, and the Boston Research Climate Group. Health Care Access and Utilization Why is This Important? Access to comprehensive, quality health care services is important for promoting and maintaining health, preventing and managing disease, and reducing the chance of premature death. Access is multi -faceted and includes components such as the ability to ent er the health care system (largely by having insurance coverage), having a regular source of health care , and being able to access health care services when needed.78 However, inequities exist and not all who need high quality health care are able to access it. Those who face barriers to access are less likely to receive medical care, more likely to delay care, and less likely to use prevention services, resulting in poorer health status and outcomes. From a community perspective, lack of 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 216 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative access results in i ncreased incidence of preventable disease, excessive and inappropriate use of hospital emergency rooms, and higher overall health care costs. Key Findings in This Section Boston is a city with many health care resources and a high proportion of residents h ave health insurance. Focus group participants, interviewees, and Boston CHNA survey respondents all indicated satisfaction with the health care in their community. Residents most commonly obtain health care from a private doctor's office or a public healt h clinic or community health center and BRFSS results indicated that approximately eight in ten respondents have at least one person as their personal doctor. Community survey respondents indicated that having a regular source of care is one of the top fac tors that makes it easier for them to get the health care services they need. Dental care was also asked about in the community health survey and nearly three -quarters of respondents reported that they had had a dental check -up in the past year. There are some differences by population group however: Asian and Latino residents were significantly less likely than White residents to indicate having one person as a personal doctor or health care provider; Latino and Black residents were less likely tha n White or Asian residents to have a seen a dentist in the past year . Barriers to accessing health care in Boston exist according to focus group members, interviewees, and community survey respondents. The most common barriers mentioned by interviewees and focus g roup members included underinsurance; language and immigration status; navigation and care coordination challenges; transportation; and lack of culturally -sensitive approaches to care. For CHNA community survey respondents, long wait times for appointments and lack of evening or weekend services were the top two factors that made it difficult for them to access health care . Cost of care, especially dental care, was also cited as a challenge for some Boston residents. A higher proportion of Black and Latino residents reported cost as a barrier to accessing both medical and dental care. Satisfaction and Use of Health Care Services As noted previously, Boston CHNA survey respondents identified access to health care as an important factor in defining a healthy community and as a strength in their community. Mirroring these sentiments, most Boston CHNA survey respondents indicated that they were satisfied with the health care in their community. As shown in Figure 169, 71.2% said they strongly or somewhat agreed with the statement, \"I am satisfied with the health care system in my community\", while 86.7% agreed that they are \"satisfied with my health care provider\" and 87.3% agreed that they could \"access health care services easily.\" 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 217 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Figure 169 . Percent Boston CHNA Survey Respondents Reporting Perceptions of Health Care System and Access, 2019 DATA SOURCE: Boston CHNA Community Survey, 2019 NOTE: Percentage calculations do not include respondents who responded \"not applicable/don't know\" Similarly, focus group and interview participants spoke positively about local health services in Boston, citing close proximity to leading health care instit utions. In the Community Assets section of this report, data show that there are numerous hospitals and health care centers in the city. When asked about where they go if they are sick or need advice about health, of the 2,009 Boston CHNA survey responden ts answering this question, 50.9% indicated that they went to a doctor's office, while 32.1% saw their public health clinic or community health center as their place of care ( Figure 170). However, nearly one in seven ( 12.7%) indicated that they viewed the hospital emergency room as their place for seeking care or advice. Table 31 presents the responses to this question by respondent primary language (Chinese, English, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese), although numbers are small in some language group s, so results should be interpreted with caution. Of those sampled, most respondents indicated that a doctor's office was where they sought care, although nearly half of the 5 6 Haitian Creole -speaking respondents answering this question reported going to a community health center as their usual place of care ( Table 31). 71.2% 86.7% 87.3%28.8% 13.3% 12.7%I am satisfied with the health care system in my community (Think: cost, availability, quality, options, etc.) I am satisfied with my health care provider I can access health care services easilyStrongly Agree/Somewhat Agree Somewhat Disagree/Strongly Disagree I am satisfied with the health care system in my community (N=1,717) I am satisfied with my health care provider (N=1,746) I can access health care services easily (N=1,769) 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 218 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Figure 170 .

Results have remained steady over the past several years, with approximately eight in ten respondents reporting having at least one person as their personal doctor.

While 66.1% of the Boston CHNA survey sample indicated that they had at least one person that they thought of as their personal doctor or health care provider, 56.8% Vietnamese -speaking respondents report ed this (See APPENDIX I ).

According to American Community Sur vey 2013 -2017 estimates, 3.9% of the overall population (civilian, noninstitutionalized) in Boston were uninsured, while only 1.4% of the population under 19 years old were uninsured.80 Among the Boston civilian population, 29.6% have Medicaid (MassHealth) coverage.81 These statistics mirror how insurance was discussed in the focus groups and interviews. Very few focus group participants spoke about concerns of being uninsured. Those that did discuss challenges with lack of insurance were homeless, undocumented immigra nts, or students. Homeless residents in focus groups specifically discussed the challenge of not having a 78.2% 81.5% * 72.5% *Boston Asian Black Latino White Female Male Asian females Black females Latina females White females Asian males Black males Latino males White males Heterosexual/non-transgender LGBTQ2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 222 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative permanent mailing address or being unable to access birth certificates as making it difficult to gain insurance coverage. A more common theme that em erged in focus group discussions was that many residents reported being under -insured \u2014or having insurance coverage that does not adequately cover someone's full health care needs. Many focus group participants, especially those on MassHealth, perceived tha t there was a limited number of providers, particularly specialists, who accepted MassHealth. Focus group participants who were Dorchester residents, for example, described needing specialty treatments for chronic or debilitating conditions but being denie d coverage after a limited time. One focus group participant shared, \"The only thing that helps me with my condition is heated pool therapy, but MassHealth only covers it for 8 sessions. Why 8 weeks if my condition is lifelong?\" Others discussed challenge s with dealing with the complexities of insurance coverage and figuring out what was even covered and what was not. As one focus group participant commented, \"It should never be this difficult to get insurance sorted out. If I miss one injection [of insul in], I could put my life in danger.\" Focus group participants who identified as low income, homeless, or as residents in recovery most frequently cited a need for better dental coverage, citing limited coverage with public insurance. One participant from Dorchester shared , \"I have so many holes in my mouth because MassHealth doesn't cover any filling or root canals. If you need anything other than a cleaning, it's not going to be covered. It's the bare minimum.\" Barriers to Health Care Access While focus group, interview, and survey participants were positive about the quality and proximity of health care in their community, they still cited several concerns over access. The biggest barriers to health care access discussed in the focus groups w ere: being under -insured; language and immigration status; navigation and care coordination challenges; transportation; and lack of culturally -sensitive approaches to care. Cost was not identified as a major barrier to care for the majority of participants ; however, a few focus group participants discussed cost barriers in relation to affording medication for chronic diseases, and the challenge of competing costs on a fixed income. \"When you're stressed about the fact that not enough money is coming in, you have bills to pay, and then a medical issue that needs to be addressed, but you can't afford the treatment...you make hard decisions.\" \u2014 Focus group participant Engagement with Health Care Providers and Staff Unfriendly, uninterested, or rushed health care providers and office staff in health care settings were also issues that focus group participants mentioned. Some focus group participants described feeling \"unseen\" by their health care providers, citing fee ling rushed or seeing providers who seemed disengaged. One East Boston resident shared, \"I went to the doctor, and no one looked me in the eyes; they sent me home with so many medicines, but no one asked me how I was...it's like they don't see the whole pers on.\" 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 223 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Navigating a Complex System When discussing access to care, a prominent theme across focus groups and interviews was the challenge of navigating the complex health system. Focus group members spoke about the struggle understanding their health care benefits, reporting that they \"felt lost in the system.\" Seniors were described as especially vulnerable to challenges navigating the health system. Several focus group participants emphasized that many simply do not know what resources are available to them or how to access them. One interviewee summarized, \"When you have to find services and then you have to go to them...when you've [experienced] trauma, coordinating all this stuff yourself is really hard; organizing and having to stay on top of it. We are no t as good with coordination as a system; we've talked about it, but we don't really know what that looks like yet at the ground level.\" Senior focus group participants also indicated that more efforts were needed to educate seniors on insurance coverage. One resident from Mattapan shared, \"Medicare patients are expected to learn and understand how everything works, what they have and don't have on their own.\" Participants identified a need for more navigation services that could help patients access servic es and resources across sectors. Multiple key informants and focus group participants identified peer navigators and community health workers as valuable resources. One focus group participant shared, \" Doctors only have a certain amount of time and you can 't rely on them to talk to patients about everything. But there does need to be more navigators available to help patients understand and explain.\" Key informants echoed the value of these services; however, reimbursement models and funding constraints app ear to make it difficult for organizations to fund these positions, as some key informants noted. Transportation Barriers Transportation was also mentioned by assessment participants as a challenge to accessing health care. Some focus group participants n oted that public transportation is limited for accessing services locally as well as for accessing specialty care. One parent shared, \" My son has to see a specialist, but I don't drive, and it can take up to 3 hours to get to the specialty care [he goes to outside the city].\" Another key informant echoed this sentiment, sharing, \" We need more resources within the community so [residents] don't have to travel through a bunch of different neighborhoods. Even getting to BMC from Mattapan or Dorchester is a tre k for a lot of people; are you really going to counseling when you have to take two busses and a train to get there?\" Culturally -Sensitive Approaches to Care For immigrant communities, participants described immigration status (e.g., undocumented vs. docum ented status) as a significant barrier to accessing health care. Key informants spoke of fear in undocumented or mixed status families which prevented residents from seeking care. One key informant explained, \"Immigrant populations face challenges [accessi ng care]. It is a hostile environment; even though we are a sanctuary city they do not feel safe.\" Another key informant perceived that immigration fears were particularly prominent in the Latino community, one sharing, \"Hispanic folks are more worried that they will get picked up [by authorities]; there is a lot of real concern out there. Residents are going underground and there's a hesitation working on anything including treatment, health care, and housing.\" Further, the need for increased li nguistic capacity in the health care and social service landscape was also a 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 224 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative common theme among qualitative conversations, particularly in non -English focus group and key informants who worked in health and social services. The importance of culturally -sensitive approaches to care were also discussed among multiple focus group and interviews. For example, some focus group participants spoke of cultural and gender norms of not seeking health care unless things are bad. One Mattapan resident expressed, \"Hait ian men only take care of themselves when they are very sick. They [don't seek out] health care; women are likely to seek health care because they are having children and take care of their families.\" Others spoke of preferences for non -Western approaches to care, with one interviewee sharing, \"Clients may have more stigmatized view of Western Medicine... may rely more heavily on natural healers that are more connected in the neighborhood.\" These culturally -sensitive approaches to care were also described as imperative for religious minority groups, shared key informants. For example, one interviewee explained that there are misconceptions in the health field related to the Muslim community such as preferences for same -sex providers. They shared, \" Even in Bost on, which is a very open, forward -moving city...we're viewed as being repressed because we don't shake hands or want male providers; but in my mind, it's about the choice of separation between men and women.\" Further, LGBTQ youth described the need for more LGBTQ -centric care but also stressed the importance of providers taking into considerations the many intersecting identifies that a patient could hold. For example, being a queer -identifying teenager who is also a person of color. As one young person desc ribed, \"We have to face a double whammy with already having the stigma of being LGBTQ and then adding race on top of that makes it even harder.\" CHNA Survey Respondent Barriers : Inconvenient Hours /Location, Cost, Transportation, and Provider Availability Some of these themes were identified in the Boston CHNA survey, while survey respondents were also likely to cite wait times and availability of hours as issues to accessing care. When Boston CHNA survey respondents were asked about the factors that made i t harder for them to get the health care services they needed in the past two years, issues related to convenience (long wait for an appointment ( 43.6%), lack of evening/weekend services (38. 0%)), cost of care (33. 7%), lack of transportation ( 18.9%), and o ffice not accepting new patients (18. 2%)) were cited as the top five most challenging issues ( Figure 175 ); however none of these were cited by a majority of respondents. As shown in Table 32 , many of these issues were similar across sub -populations by primary language, although instead of lack of transportation or office not accepting new patients being an issue, Chinese -speaking respondents indicated \"language problems/could not communicate with health provider or office staff\" and \"unfriendly doctors, providers, or office staff\" and Vietnamese -speaking respondents indicated \"afraid to ask questions or talk to doctors/medical people\" as challenges. Spanish - and Portuguese -speakers also indica ted that \"don't have health insurance that covers what I need\" as a barrier to getting health care services in the last two years, while Haitian Creole -speaking respondents additionally cited \"don't know what types of services are available\" as a barrier. Table 33 shows responses by additional sub -populations, including by race/ethnicity, parents who have children under 18 years old, LGBTQ respondents, and respondents unde r 18 and 65+ years old. 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 225 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Figure 175 .

Overall, cost is a much bigger barrier for dental care than it is for overall health care. Figure 176 shows that in the combined BRFSS data for 2013, 2015, and 2017, 10% of respondents did not see a doctor in the past 12 months due to cost, and responses differed significantly within some specific sub -populations by race/ethnicity, housing statu s, education, age, foreign or U.S. born, income, and employment. The dental question was only asked on the 2017 BRFSS, and results show that 17.4% of residents could not see a dentist in the past 12 months due to cost. Figure 177 shows results by different sub -populations. Figure 176 .

When Boston CHNA survey respondents were asked what factors made it easier for them to get the health care servic es they needed in the past two years, having a regular source of care (63. 3%), having insurance cover what they needed (49. 7%), providers taking their insurance (47. 8%), having positive interactions with doctors, providers, or office staff ( 39.8%), and fee ling comfortable asking questions (37. 3%) were the top five factors cited ( Figure 180). Table 34 and Table 35 present the top five factors that different sub -populations noted made it easier for them to get the health care services they needed in the past two years.

While having a regular source of care and insu rance covering what they needed was important for everyone, particular facilitators for some groups included: having positive interactions with doctors, providers, or office staff among Portuguese speakers, Vietnamese speakers, Black respondents, Asian res pondents, parents, LGBTQ respondents, and those under 18 years old and 65+ years old; affordable care among Chinese -speaking and Haitian Creole -speaking respondents; and having providers or staff speak their language/understand their culture among Chinese speakers, Vietnamese speakers, Asian respondents overall, and youth survey respondents under 18 years old. Availability of public transportation was also helpful for many survey respondents. Figure 180 .

This section summarizes and presen ts these recommendations for future initiatives. Employment and Workforce - Focus group participants commonly discussed challenges securing well -paying jobs due barriers that include educational requirements, hiring processes, technology skills, and having a criminal record. Community suggestions to address employment barriers include addressing minimum education requirements to be more inclusive of those with valuable lived experience; subsidizing the cost of childcare so low-income parents can work towards upward mobility through education and job training; and increasing meaningful employment opportunities for young people, especially during the summer and school breaks. Participants shared that it would be imperative that these efforts focus on \"21st century skills\" like technology, professional communication, information literacy, and critical thinking. Increasing access to trade professions like machine training, carpentry, and electrical work were also described as valuable. Income and Financial Security - These were often discussed in the context of access to employment and income inequality. Participants talked about the challenges making ends meet due to low -wage jobs with little room for advancement. Specific suggestions include invest ments that enhance access to careers for Boston youth that lead to stable employment and economic mobility, and pathways for immigrant communities and non -English speakers to professional advancement in order to engage a workforce that meets the needs of a diverse population. Education - Children with special needs, undocumented students, and those who have experienced trauma were identified as groups that needed more support in and outside of the classroom. Suggestions were made to focus resources on early childhood education, especially for children ages 0 -5; increase social supports in public schools, particularly in communities of color; train educators on trauma -informed approaches to recognize trauma symptoms and respond accordingly; use restorative ju stice approaches to discipline and behavior issues; and address chronic absenteeism by bolstering wrap around services like in-home therapy, community field coordinators, and therapeutic mentors. Food Insecurity - Key informant interviews and low -income fo cus group participants across neighborhoods discussed the challenge of not having enough money to afford the food they and their families needed. Participants identified seniors and children as being especially vulnerable to being food insecure. Suggestion s were made to increase opportunities to access healthy and affordable food through: urban farming and community gardens; farmer's markets that accept SNAP benefits; and strengthening initiatives that address food access from a clinical perspective, where practitioners can prescribe services and are reimbursed as part of the ACO plans. 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 235 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Housing - Focus group and interview participants stressed the importance of mitigating the negative impacts of gentrification and displacement by creating more opportunities for home ownership in non -White communities to build generational wealth; and pushing for long-term renewable leases for nonprofits and social services agencies that are being strained by rising costs to operate. Other specific suggestions include: explori ng small property acquisitions to develop community affordable housing; supporting nonprofit developers; investing in more senior housing and supports; and increasing linkage fee programs \u2014an alternative to traditional inclusionary housing programs that att empt to link the production of market -rate real estate to the production of affordable housing. Key informant interviewees also noted ACO implementation as an opportunity to strengthen and coordinate the housing and health care sectors. Leveraging hospital community benefit funding with Medicaid flex service dollars may provide an opportunity for greater investment in housing instability. Additionally, moving these health care -housing partnerships to providing place -based/housing -based services for health c are and social services would reach people where they live with the range of medical and ancillary services that they need in a coordinated way. Transportation - Some focus group participants reported being generally satisfied with transportation access in their neighborhoods, while others voiced concerns about cost, timeliness, and accessibility \u2014especially for the elderly. Specific suggestions include focusing on transportation equity in lower income communities that tend to have longer commuting times; be engaged in reducing traffic by investing in speedy bus lanes; continue making the city more bikeable; and exploring fee structures for ride share programs to generate revenue for operational costs at the local level. Chronic Disease - Interview participants indicated that there is a need to focus on prevention strategies and chronic disease management \u2014particularly to prevent diabetes and obesity. Community residents indicated the need for more affordable gym and healthy food options, especially in the winter time and especially for young people during school breaks. Community residents suggested investing in exercise stations in public parks and within community health centers. There were also suggestions to invest in community outreach efforts to increase pu blic knowledge about prevention of chronic diseases in trusted community spaces like faith -based organizations and in public schools. Mental Health - Stress, anxiety, and depression were the most frequently -cited challenges among Boston residents. Communit y suggestions to address mental health issues include investing in more mental health supports in public schools \u2014especially for young children who have experienced trauma and for underserved communities like non -English speakers, LGBTQ residents, and homeb ound seniors. Also stressed was the importance of reducing cultural stigma around mental health services and recruiting more clinicians who reflect the rich racial and ethnic diversity of Boston. According to community participants, it will be imperative to consider intersecting identities and social statuses that may be salient to mental health approaches, for example, those who identify as queer people of color or immigrant parents of children with special needs. In terms of careers in the field of menta l health and substance use, participants stressed that it will be important to address systemic barriers that detract professionals from seeking careers in the field due low salaries, emotionally demanding work, and stringent certification requirements. Su ggestions include: investing in micro degrees that allow residents to advance professionally in a less costly way; invest in 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 236 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative student loan forgiveness initiatives; forging stronger connections between learning institutions and the job market; and addressing fee for service models and reporting requirements that limit service -delivery and creativity. Substance Use - Assessment participants mentioned a variety of substances including opioids, marijuana, and prescription drug use as issues in their communities. Participants were especially concerned about the impact of substance use disorders on young people and suggest ed focusing on prevention efforts, especially related to marijuana use and prescription drug use among adolescents. Violence and Trauma - Community violence was reported as a frequent concern by focus group participants, with children and communities of co lor being disproportionately affected. Intimate partner violence was also mentioned by participants who identified non - English speaking immigrants as particularly vulnerable. Suggestions to address violence and trauma in the city include: restoring trust a mong government, police, and health care institutions by strengthening community linkages and improving community cohesion. Specific examples include intergenerational programs and services that are specific to diverse affinity groups; a multi -faceted appr oach to community safety that includes community -based policing, strengthening partnerships with community -based organizations and law enforcement, and transparency through venues like community share -outs. Hosting these events in familiar spaces like fait h-based organizations, libraries, and community centers will be important. In terms of trauma, suggestions were made to: invest in trauma - informed approaches beginning in early childhood and continuing throughout high school; build on the work of local gro ups to avoid duplicative services; widen the trauma -informed care lens by expanding neighborhood trauma teams and bringing interdisciplinary groups together; and focusing on familial responses to trauma from a community -driven, grassroots approach. Also st ressed was the importance of compensating community members for their participation and expertise in these efforts via a stipend. Maternal and Child Health - A common theme that emerged among focus group with parents \u2014many of whom identified as single mothe rs\u2014was the need for more supports to learn positive parenting skills. Unaffordable and inconvenient childcare was also mentioned as a significant concern among focus group participants; suggestions were made to subsidize the cost of childcare for low -incom e families, especially for single -headed households. Additionally, a few key informants noted the lack of data on child health in the city, which made it difficult to enumerate a problem or track change. They saw the Boston Census survey supplement on chil d care and other new data initiatives starting to fill this gap, but would look forward to more robust and collaborative efforts on data gathering around child health. Environmental Health - Environmental health concerns such as climate change and air pollutants were discussed among assessment participants. There were suggestions to address environmental health concerns in a systemic way and in partnership across sectors and disciplines, especially as new developments increase across the city. According to key informants, it will be important to target neighborhoods that have been deemed as high -risk by initiatives such as Climate Ready Boston. There were also suggestions to invest in a centralized data repository to track environmental health data in order to more accurately measure extreme heat days, flooding, and natural disasters; these data will facilitate more meaningful discussions related to climate change's impact on health care costs. 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 237 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Health Care Access - The biggest barriers to health care access d iscussed in the focus groups were: being under -insured; language and immigration status; navigation and care coordination challenges; transportation; and lack of culturally -sensitive approaches to care. Suggestions related to health care access was to incr ease supports for navigating the complex health system and delivering culturally -sensitive care and linguistically appropriate services to diverse groups. Community residents shared that it will be essential to train staff from diverse communities for prof essional roles such as peer navigators and interpreters. Other areas to focus on according to assessment participants include bolstering oral health services for those on public insurance, addressing re -imbursement barriers for sustaining positions like pe er navigators and community health workers; and mitigating transportation barriers by exploring alternatives such as ride share stipends for patients. Collaboration between different organizations and agencies were identifie d as a strength and has improved in recent years; however, respondents identified a need for even greater collaboration and information/data sharing to better serve their patients and clients, especially related to the roll out of Accountable Care Organizat ions. Specific suggestions include incentivizing collaboration between health care and community -based organizations in an equitable way and using data to that translates into a real implementation action plan that is owned by a convener who will drive the plan forward and hold institutions accountable. From a key informant perspective, funding was top of mind for sustaining efforts across the public and health care sector to stabilize and enhance programming. Specific suggestions including pursuing multi -year funding that allow organizations to respond to crisis and opportunities, and to build internal and external capacity. Other suggestions include diversifying funding streams to focus on private and philanthropic endeavors as federal and state funding b ecomes more limited. For example, t here were suggestions to model Rhode Island's health equity zones that focus on place -based investments in the built environment for the most at -risk neighborhoods. 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 238 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative KEY THEMES AND CONCLUSIONS Collabo rative used a participatory, collaborative approach to conduct the first joint citywide CHNA through a review of existing data, community survey, and discussions with community residents and key informants. This assessment report provides a comprehensive o verview of the health -related needs, strengths, and resources of Boston - including specific population groups - within a socioeconomic context to inform future planning. Overarching themes that emerged from this synthesis that cut across multiple topic areas include the following: Health disparities across most issues show similar patterns by racial/ethnic group and socioeconomic status, and mirror the historical inequities brought about by generations of institutional racism, structural barriers, and dis criminatory policies. Whether differences in cancer mortality or asthma prevalence - or unemployment rates and housing instability - similar patterns can be seen in the data, with communities of color, immigrant communities, lower income individuals, and r esidents of low resourced neighborhoods, among others, experiencing a disproportionate burden across nearly all areas. Although current data sources are not currently designed to be able to examine intersecting identities more deeply, this disproportionate burden is likely even worse when considering intersectionality \u2014that is, the complex, cumulative way in which the effects of multiple forms of discrimination (such as racism, sexism, and classism) combine, overlap, or intersect, especially in the experienc es of marginalized groups. These issues are dynamically intertwined and reflect the cumulative and current challenges residents face resulting from historical and structural inequities across multiple systems. With a current population of nearly 670,000 r esidents, Boston has experienced \u2014and is expected to continue to experience \u2014population growth across every neighborhood in the city, though growth rates across neighborhoods vary. Overall, Boston is a young city, with about one-third of residents under the age of 24, that continues to experience population growth. The greatest increases in population have occurred in Roxbury, South Boston, Hyde Park, East Boston, and Charlestown. Boston is a richly diverse city in terms of racial, ethnic, and linguistic popu lation groups, though data show this diversity is not similar across neighborhoods. Boston's large immigrant and non -English speaking communities were identified as facing unique challenges related to social and economic factors as well as navigating the h ealth care system. The wide -ranging diversity of Boston residents presents challenges when delivering health and social services that aim to meet the multitude of needs across the city. Additionally, CHNA community survey results and conversations in focus groups indicated that subtle and overt discrimination is an issue in Boston, particularly for immigrants and non -English speakers, LGBTQ residents, youth and older residents, substance users and the homeless . Although unemployment rates are low and there is economic opportunity for many residents across the city, there are substantial differences in financial security across neighborhoods and racial and ethnic groups. The median household income in Boston is $62,021 but ranges from $27,964 in Dorchester t o $170,152 in South Boston. In four communities \u2014Dorchester, Fenway, Roxbury and the South End \u2014 approximately 25 -37% of residents live below the federal poverty level . Focus group and interview participants 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 239 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative discussed the role poverty plays in exacerbating health challenges, particularly among vulnerable groups. Quantitative data show that risk -related behaviors and health outcomes generally continue to have inverse relationships with socioeconomic factors. Housing affordability and its implications emerged as a key theme that arose across secondary data, the community survey, and focus groups and interviews. Of all social determinants identified as imperative to health and well -being, housing stability emerge d as a top priority among participants. More than half of those in renter -occupied units across the city are housing cost -burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing. Residents frequently discussed issues of gentrification, long w ait lists for Section 8 housing, housing discrimination, overcrowding, and poor housing quality as consequences of a tight and expensive housing market. The impact of chronic diseases and their risk factors \u2014especially diabetes, obesity, and pediatric ast hma\u2014emerged as a priority concern among residents. Residents of color, as well as residents who live in Roxbury and Dorchester are disproportionately affected by chronic diseases. Assessment participants frequently discussed a number of social determinant s that presented challenges to the prevention and management of these chronic conditions. In addition to poverty and high housing costs that force individuals to prioritize their spending, a lack of affordable recreational programming and access to nutriti ous food were described as barriers to health and well -being. Lower income neighborhoods were described as having fewer affordable gyms, grocery stores, and fast food and convenience stores compared to affluent areas. Behavioral health, specifically menta l health and drug addiction among young people are growing concerns among community residents; opioids, prescription medication, and marijuana use were reported as most concerning. Co-occurring mental health and substance use issues were frequently discuss ed among key informants, as well as the interrelationship between trauma, mental health, and substance use. Quantitative data show that one in five Boston residents report persistent anxiety and this proportion has increased over time. The rate of opioid o verdose deaths in Boston has also significantly increased, particularly among Latino resident s. Specific population groups are disparately affected by mental health and substance use, especially residents who are younger, LGBTQ, lower income, and of commun ities of color. Violence -based trauma was identified as a major factor of negative community health outcomes, and there is a need for more trauma -informed approaches to care, particularly for children and communities of color. One in four Boston CHNA commu nity survey respondents described their neighborhoods as unsafe or extremely unsafe, with Black and Latino respondents more likely to describe their communities this way. Apart from community violence and intimate partner violence, assessment participants identified poverty, and more recently, the fear of deportation and family separation, as a growing issue. Exposure of children and youth to unhealthy relationships and violence (adverse childhood experiences) is also of concern: nearly one in five Boston a dults reported experiencing one adverse experience over their lifetime. Environmental health risk factors are a particular concern in relation to air quality, effects of climate change , and the built environment. Poor environmental health quality has the greatest impact on low -income communities. Issues such as noise and air pollution and dangerous traffic were prominent concerns among survey respondents. Indoor air quality is also an issue, and more than one in ten Boston adults on the BRFSS reported exposure to secondhand smoke, with Asian, Black, and Latino residents all significantly 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 240 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative more likely than White residents to report exposure. The effects of climate change were also noted, with flooding being one of the most significant issues. Boston emergenc y department utilization rates and costs for climate -driven health issues are expected to rise in the future . Climate change projections estimate that 7% of Boston's land area could be exposed to frequent stormwater flooding by 2050. Boston has many health care and social service assets that can be leveraged, but access to those services is a challenge for some residents. Proximity of health care services and education institutions, diversity and multiculturalism, and engaged residents were noted as key str engths among Bostonians that can be leveraged in future planning. Barriers to care were multifaceted and included underinsurance , language and immigration status , navigation and care coordination challenges , transportation , and lack of culturally -sensitive approaches to care. Strengthening partnerships and infrastructure for collaborative data gathering and sharing can facilitate greater coordination and identify specific population groups most in need. Undertaking this coll aborative CHNA demonstrated that organizations can leverage their strengths and resources for collaborative assessment and planning. However, as extensive as the data gathering was for this effort, it also identified current limitations. Large datasets are not necessarily available on some population groups such as residents who speak specific languages or on particular topics such as child health ages 0 -14 years old. Additionally, data sharing across organizations and agencies is challenging. As the Collab orative engages in further planning, there is opportunity ahead to strengthen the relationships, practices, and infrastructure to address these data limitations. In the future, potentially more granular analyses by neighborhood, topic, or population group can be conducted to help tailor strategies for action. 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 241 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative PRIORITIES FOR COLLABORATIVE ACTION The Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative aims to undertake a collaborative planning process May - September 2019 to identify the prioritized issues on which this cross -sector group will take action. The planning process includes identifying priorities, goals, measurable objectives, strategies, and success metrics for a three -year community health improvement plan (CHIP). The first step in the planning process is to identi fy the priorities for the CHIP. Prioritization allows institutions and organizations to target and align resources, leverage efforts, and focus on achievable strategies and goals for addressing priority needs. Through a systematic, engaged approach that is informed by data, priorities are identified for the Collaborative to focus its planning efforts. This section describes the process and outcomes of the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative prioritization process. Process and Criteria for Prioritization In Apri l 2019, the CHIP work group \u2014comprised of representatives from hospitals, health centers, community organizations, and the Boston Public Health Commission \u2014developed prioritization criteria and an engagement strategy for identifying 2 -4 priority needs for th e subsequent Community Health Improvement Plan. Criteria were selected to assess the magnitude of community issues and their impact on the most disadvantaged population groups. The criteria and guiding questions selected are below; full definitions of each of these criteria can be found in Appendix J. Burden: How much does this issue affect health in Boston? Equity: Will addressing this issue substantially benefit those most in need? Impact: Can working on this issue achieve both short -term and long-term change? Feasibility: Is it possible to address this issue given infrastructure, capacity, and political will? Collaboration: Are there existing groups across sectors willing to work together on this issue? Prioritization Process The prioritizati on process was multi -stepped and aimed to be inclusive, participatory, and data - driven. During May 2019, several steps were taken to identify the final 2 -4 priorities for the planning process. Early -Mid May 2019 First, a 16 -page draft Executive Summary of this CHNA report was sent to over 150 organizations and individuals along with an online survey for prioritization. The online survey included 19 key issues that emerged from the draft CHNA and participants were asked to rate each issue against each of the five criteria (burden, equity, impact, feasibility, and collaboration) from 1 -4 with 1=low, 2=medium, 3=high, and 4=very high. Figure 181 indicates the average score across the five criteria for the issues rated. 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 242 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Figure 181. Rating Tool Average Score of 1=Low, 2=Medium, 3=High, 4=Very High across Five Criteria (Burden, Equity, Impact, Feasibility, and Collaboration), (N=38 organizations), 2019 Concurrently in early to mid -May, numerous small group discussions occurred throughout the city with community residents, organizational staff, and other stakeh olders. These discussions included a data presentation of the draft CHNA key findings, overview of the 19 key issues that emerged and the five criteria used for prioritization, and an interactive discussion with participants on what priorities rose to the top for them based on these criteria. Ten meetings were held with 121 individuals. Participants included community residents from Roxbury, Mattapan, and Jamaica Plain (three community meetings), members of the Boston Board of Health, nine City of Boston departments, leadership from community health centers across Boston, and members of health care institutions' community advisory committees/ community advisory boards. A number of priorities commonly rose to the top in these qualitative discussions: Housi ng - specific concerns related to affordability, displacement, gentrification, homelessness Employment & income - specific concerns related to job opportunities and economic security; important to focus on upstream inequities Mental health - critical to n ote that many mental health issues co -occurring with substance use; concerns around availability of services and barriers to accessing services Substance use - critical to note that many substance use disorders are co -occurring with mental health issues; s pecific concerns around opioids, alcohol, and youth smoking Violence & trauma - specific concerns related to community safety and the impact of trauma on mental health 3.25 3.22 3.11 3.10 2.96 2.88 2.85 2.84 2.72 2.66 2.66 2.62 2.60 2.59 2.57 2.56 2.54 2.45 2.43Housing Affordability & Quality Substance Use Food Insecurity/Hunger Mental Health Employment & Income/Financial Insecurity Community violence Education Homelessness Obesity, Healthy Eating, Physical Activity Accessing Healthcare Accessing Childcare and Other Services Cancer Asthma Smoking and Vaping/E-cigarettes Heart disease Interpersonal Violence Diabetes Climate Change and Environmental Concerns Transportation & the Built Environment2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 243 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Chronic conditions - specific concerns related to obesity, healthy food access, cancer, and diabetes Food insecurity -specific concerns around economic insecurity and the connections to obesity The results from the online prioritization rating survey and small group discussions were used to refine the priority list from 19 topics to t he following 9 potential priorities: Housing - Affordability, Quality, and Homelessness Food Insecurity/Hunger Employment & Income/Financial Insecurity Education Substance Use Mental Health Community Violence Obesity, Healthy Eating, Physical Activity Accessing Health care , Childcare, & Other Services Late May 2019 The next step in the prioritization process was a large in -person meeting for further engagement and refinement in the prioritization process. On May 29, 2019, over 100 community re sidents and organizational staff across a multitude of sectors community residents attended a three -hour evening meeting in Roxbury. This meeting included a brief data presentation on the key findings from the draft CHNA, a description of the prioritizatio n process thus far and the refined set of nine priorities, small group discussions, and a large group voting process. The goal of the voting process was to identify 2 -4 priorities for collaborative planning. During the voting process, each participant rec eived four dots, to vote for four issues among the nine (one dot per issue). The results of the dot voting can be found in Table 36. Table 36. Initial Results of May 29th Prioritization Meeting Dot Voting Process Topic Total Votes Housing - Affordability, Quality, and Homelessness 66 Employment & Income/Financial Insecurity 63 Mental Health 48 Access to health care, childcare, & other services 32 Education 31 Food Insecurity/Hunger 26 Substance Use 20 Community Violence 15 Obesity, Healthy Eating, Physical Activity 10 Other 1 After the dot voting process, participants discussed the results to identify the top priorities. Participants suggested combining mental health and substance use into the more inclusive category of behavioral health and to consider integrating education in to the category of 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 244 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative employment and income/ financial security. At the end of the discussion, participants were leaning towards the top priorities as: Housing Behavioral Health Employment, Income/Financial Insecurity, and Education Access to Health care , Childcare, and Other Services Early June 2019 In early June 2019, the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Steering Committee met to discuss the identified priorities and to brainstorm a cross -cutting/overarching focus to frame future planning. From that discussio n, the Steering Committee recommended renaming the Employment, Income, and Education priority to be Financial Security and Mobility to encapsulate how employment, income, education, and workforce training are all critical and inter -related factors that can contribute to financial security. Additionally, there was a strong movement to have a cross -cutting and overarching focus for the plan to guide this collaborative work. Discussions centered on an overarching focus being racial equity to recognize that institutional racism and structural in equities are what drive the health inequities we see around race, ethnicity, and language in the city. Prioritized Needs for Collaborative Planning After further definition and refinement of the priorities and cross -cutting/overarching plan focus by the S teering Committee and CHIP work group in mid -June, the final prioritized needs for the planning process are: Housing (including affordability, quality, homelessness, ownership, gentrification, and displacement) Financial Security and Mobility (including jobs, employment, income, education, and workforce training) Behavioral Health (including mental health and substance use) Accessing Services (including health care, childcare and social services) The cross -cutting and overarching focus of the planning process will be around Achieving Racial and Ethnic Health Equity recognizing that institutional racism and structural inequities are what drive the health disparities we see around race, ethnicity, and language in the city for nearly all issues. Next Steps From June -September 2019, the Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative, in conjunction with key stakeholders and community residents, will develop an implementation strategy that outlines next steps to address the prioritized health needs from the CHNA. The CHIP development process will commence with a full -day planning session in late June 2019 to develop the initial output for the goals, objectives, and strategies within each priority area. Further refinement and development of the CHIP will occur during the summer 2019, with a final CHIP report and Year 1 Action Planning to be completed by September 2019. 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 245 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILES The following section presents one -page summaries by neighborhood of key social, economic, and health indicators included in this report. As noted in the beginning of this report, Boston neighborhoods can be identified in several ways. In this report, zi p codes are used to identify neighborhood boundaries since this information is collected with health data analyzed by Boston Public Health Commission and is consistent with previous Health of Boston reports. Please note that the zip code neighborhood defin itions used in this report may differ from what are used by other organizations and agencies. The zip codes used in this report for identifying neighborhoods are those currently used by the United States Postal Service (USPS). USPS zip codes are not based on geography, demographics, or population size; they are collections of mail delivery routes that are defined at the convenience of the U.S. Postal Service and may change from time to time. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau comes in the form of Zip Code Ta bulation Areas (ZCTAs), generalized areal representations of USPS zip code service areas. ZCTA is a trademark of the U.S. Census Bureau whereas ZIP Code is a trademark of the U.S. Postal Service.

TECHNICAL NOTES FOR COMMONLY CITED DATASETS These technical notes were provided by Boston Public Health Commission and include background around data sources commonly used throughout this report. Survey Data U. S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey The American Community Survey (ACS) uses a s ample of the population to provide information about demographics, housing, and socioeconomic characteristics of communities. People who live in households, students, and those in institutions or other group quarters (e.g. jails, college dormitories, and n ursing homes) are sampled. The ACS is administered through mailed and online questionnaires and can include telephone or personal visit follow -up if needed. The mailed and online questionnaires are available in English and Spanish and can be made available in Chinese, Russian, Korean, and Vietnamese . Telephone interviews are available in over 30 languages. This report presents estimates both for single and aggregated years of the ACS . The ACS results used in describing the Boston population are subject to the limitations common to all surveys. Samples produce estimates that can never be as precise as tabulations of the whole population. Other kinds of errors can further affect the prec ision of estimates, and nonrandom (or systematic) error has the potential to bias findings. Boston Public Health Commission, Boston Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BBRFSS) The Boston Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BBRFSS) is a sy stem of telephone health surveys of adults living in non -institutional household settings ages 18 and over that collects information on health risk behaviors, preventive health practices, and health care access primarily related to chronic disease and inju ry. The survey is administered in English and Spanish. The Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) conducts this independent survey approximately every other year modeled after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surv eillance System (BRFSS) survey. Over time, the survey has been modified by BPHC to be more reflective of health risk behaviors specific to the Boston population. In 2013, BBRFSS data across all data years were re -weighted to accommodate post - stratificatio n to five population dimensions (i.e., age, gender, racial/ethnic group, education and marital status). As a result, rates, percentages, and point estimates will vary from and cannot be compared with previously produced BBRFSS results. However, the Boston Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey has maintained many standard core questions included in the BRFSS used by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Results from the survey are used by BPHC to plan and implement health initiatives; to identify health problems within populations; to identify racial/ethnic inequities in access to and utilization of health care, in risk behaviors, and selected health conditions; to establish and monitor health objectives; to 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 281 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative support health -related legisla tive activities; to evaluate disease prevention activities and programs; and to assist in receiving grants and other funding. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Boston Public Schools, Boston Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) The Youth Risk Beha vior Surveillance System (YRBSS) is a system of national school -based surveys conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) every other year among public high school students in grades 9 -12. It is currently conducted in 47 states, 6 territories, 2 tribal governments, and 22 cities. The survey contains questions related to risk behaviors such as unintentional injuries and violence, alcohol and drug use, tobacco use, sexual behavior, unhealthy eating behaviors, physical inactivity, and t he prevalence of obesity and asthma. The Boston Public Health Commission uses results from the YRBSS to identify the prevalence of health risk behaviors among Boston youth, identify racial/ethnic inequities, plan and implement health initiatives, suppo rt health -related legislative activities, and assist in obtaining grants and other funding. Vital Records Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Boston Resident Live Births, Registry of Vital Records and Statistics These data present Massachusetts birt h certificate information. The recording of resident live births is considered nearly complete for Massachusetts resident births, including those that take place at home or out -of-state but to Massachusetts residents. Birth data in this report pertain only to Boston residents. For analytical purposes, infants are assigned their mother's self -reported race/ethnicity, and not a combination of both parents' race/ethnicity. Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Boston Resident Deaths, Registry of Vital Records and Statistics These data present Massachusetts death certificate information. Death data used by the Boston Public Health Commission pertain only to Boston resident decedents. Cause of death determinations are typically made by the certifying physic ian. However, t he Office of the Chief Medical Examiner is responsible for investigating the cause and manner of death occurring under violent, suspicious or unexplained circumstances. Due to delays in investigational results, cause and manner determination s may get updated after analysis of data for any given year . Additionally , certain information within the death record is obtained with the assistance of an informant, typically a family member or funeral director, which may result in errors (for example, in race/ethnicity reporting) that would not occur in self -reported data. 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 282 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative Infectious Disease Data Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Bureau of Infectious Diseases and Laboratory Sciences Data from communicable disease surveillance systems are limi ted by the degree to which people with a condition seek health care that results in testing and reporting to the system. Diseases may be asymptomatic or mild, or are treated presumptively without laboratory testing, and for some conditions, reporting may be less than complete. These factors may contribute to underestimates of the frequency of disease. New cases of chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhea infection are reported to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Boston Public Health Commission by diagnosing physicians and laboratories. Undiagnosed cases and variations in screening practice s, and compliance with reporting requirements may influence the accuracy of reported sexually transmitted infections. Massachusetts Department of Public Health, HIV/AIDS Surveillance Program New cases of HIV infection (incidence) and cases of people livin g with HIV/AIDS (prevalence) are reported to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health by diagnosing physicians and laboratories. Undiagnosed cases may influence the accuracy of reported cases and impede interpretation of HIV/AIDS case data. Other Data Acute Hospital Case -Mix Databases (Hospital Inpatient Discharge Database and Outpatient Emergency Department Database), Massachusetts Center for Health Information and Analysis These hospital patient encounter (HPE) data present information on Boston resi dent hospitalizations and emergency department visits to acute care hospitals in Massachusetts. All rates are based on encounter count totals covering fiscal years running October through September (e.g., year 2015 covers HPEs from October 2014 -September 2 015). Data from the Outpatient Hospital Observation Discharge Database are not included in this report. For a given HPE, the patient's primary diagnosis is used for determination of most health conditions in this report. Some specific injury -type hospita lizations and ED visits and all substance misuse hospital patient encounters are based on further consideration of multiple diagnosis levels after consideration of the primary diagnosis (See Injury and Substance Misuse Hospital Patient Encounters in Techni cal Notes for more information). Hospital patient encounters: In this report, hospital patient encounters include both emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Emergency department (ED) visit: Visits to acute -care hospital emergency departments for care. In this report, emergency department visit data includes cases seen in the emergency department that resulted in either a discharge directly from the hospital ED or from a hospitalization that followed ED care. ED visits resulting in a discharge from the observational 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 283 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative stay setting are excluded from this report. For Chapter 12: Injury, ED visits include only cases with a discharge from the emergency department and exclude ED visits resulting in a hospitalization. Hospitalization: Hospitalization represents a patient's continuous stay of one night or more in the hospital for observation, care, diagnosis, or treatment before being discharged (released) from the inpatient setting by the hospital. Only hospitalizations from acute -care, non -federal hospitals have been included. In this report, hospitalizations include cases originating in the emergency department that result in inpatient hospital admissions. Massachusetts Department of Public Healt h, Bureau of Substance Abuse Services The Bureau of Substance Abuse Services at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health provides publicly -supported substance misuse treatment admissions data for Boston resident treatment clients. These data are fisc al year based (July -June). Drug -specific rates of treatment clients presented in this report reflect unique -person counts of clients identifying a specific drug as being either a primary, secondary or tertiary substance of misuse. This methodology of quan tifying a given drug's exposure among the treatment client base is meant to better help identify the extent of drug -specific misuse among the client base for drugs not typically identified as a primary drug of misuse. Treatment admissions data reflect only individuals who have successfully accessed the treatment system and, therefore, do not describe the whole Boston resident drug use disorder population. 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment 284 Boston CHNA -CHIP Collaborative APPENDIX D.

North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 2 A Note of Acknowledgment to the Collaborators and the North Suffolk Communities In September of 2018, residents, health systems, community partners, and city and town leadership embarked on the first -ever collaborative Community Health Needs As sessment for the City of Chelsea, the City of Revere and the Town of Winthrop \u2014communities that make up the North Suffolk region. As part of this unprecedented collaboration, o ver 1 ,800 people who live or work in these three communities completed communi ty health and quality of life survey s--online or on paper (in English, Spanish, Portuguese , and Arabic ) and participated in f ocus groups and key informant interviews. Th is effort saw engaged, and sustained participation from collaborating provider organiza tions, municipal officials, health departments, boards of health , and community -based organizations. We believe th e following detailed i ntegrated Community Health Needs Assessment (iCHNA) report , which includes the voices of historically marginalized commu nity members and populations, captures the current state of health and quality of life in Chelsea, Revere, and Winthrop and maps out the priorities for the creation of our Community Health Implementation Plan (CHIP) . We wish to thank major service provide r organizations and coalitions --Massachusetts General Hospital, Cambridge Health Alliance, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , Melrose -Wakefield Hospital, East Boston Neighborhood Health Center, Community Action Programs Inter -City, The Neighborhood Deve lopers, North Suffolk Mental Health Association, Mystic Valley Elder Services, Revere CARES, Healthy Chelsea, Community Action for Safe Alternatives (Winthrop) --for their willingness to join in this un ique year -long collaboration. In particular, we 'd lik e to recognize Mass General's Center for Community Health Improvement , who generously supplied their expertise and countless staff hours to coordinate and facilitate dozens of iCHNA committee meetings and activities . The enthusiastic participation of all involved reflects our shared desire to understand our communities better and find ways to improve residents' health and quality of life. This report would not have been possible without the leadership support of Chelsea City Manager Tom Ambrosino, Revere Mayor Brian Arrigo , and Winthrop Town Manager Austin Faison. We are extremely grateful to everyone and look forward to working together to implement plans and initiatives that grow out of the iCHNA & CHIP. Jeffrey R.

Hospitals and other health and human services providers periodically conduct such assessments within their service areas to guide planning and comply with government requirements. Working together in se veral committees, representatives from the three communities and service providers collected and analyzed primary and secondary data for the iCHNA . The goal was to gain a comprehensive regional understanding of needs related to health and quality of life and identif y priority concerns to help guide planning for services and potential opportunities for joint action initiatives. Issue areas that have emerged in 2019 as priorities include housing, behavioral health and substance use disorders, and economic stability and mobility. Information about the iCHNA & CHIP partners and the community outreach process can be found at www.northsuffolkassessment.org . A video summariz ing the pro cess can be found at https://youtu.be/FvSAn8dzu2A . Executive Summary Neighboring Communities Request Re gional Assessment Several hospital systems, a large community health center , and a number of other health and human services agencies serve residents of Revere, Chelsea , and Winthrop. These service providers conduct periodic assessments of community needs in order to plan accordingly for delivery of services. The Affordable Care Act also requires health care institutions to conduct CHNAs every three years in communities where they have licensed facilities to demonstrate they have engaged with local communit ies to ascertain needs, especially the needs of underserved populations within their service or catchment areas. Ordinarily , each provider conducts its own assessment --not in conjunction with other service providers. The 2019 integrated Community Health N eeds Assessment and Community Health Improvement Plan, or iCHNA and CHIP, represent a departure from the usual manner in which hospitals and other providers conduct assessments. At the request of the Mayor, City Manager , and Town Manager, of Revere, Chelse a and Winthrop, hospitals and other providers agreed to work together with the municipalities and other health stakeholders to conduct a fully collaborative assessment. This request was a natural extension of an inter -municipal collaboration created in 201 6, the North Suffolk Public Health Collaborative, so named because the three communities comprise the portion of Suffolk County that is not the City of Boston. Existing Collaborative Serves as Coordinating Entity The North Suffolk Public Health Collaborat ive (NSPHC) was created so that three adjacent communities could identify shared public health challenges and opportunities to collaborate and achieve more on selected issues than the communities might achieve working on their own . The communities share some common characteristics and while having significant differences in demographics and specific health issues. Like much of the country, all three communities have populations that have become increasingly ethnically diverse, which is an important factor f or consideration in planning for health care and human services. The NSPHC director co - North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 5 coordinated the iCHNA and CHIP with a senior director at the Center for Community Health Improvement of Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the hospital system colla borators . Development of Structure and Goals The iCHNA and CHIP w ere developed through a deliberate, inclusive process, starting with the formation of a Steering Committee composed of municipal leaders and representatives of the three communities' health departments and boards of health, along with the health and human services providers and community residents. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was created which the municipalities and collaborating organizations were asked to sign. Language in the MOU addressed the vision and goals of the process . iCHNA Collaborative Vision -To use the upcoming iCHNA and CHIP to work towards a North Suffolk region where : o Individuals from all backgrounds and circumstances will have every opportunity to live a healthy l ife. o Local governments, health care providers, social service and community -based organizations, and community residents work in continuous partnership to improve health outcomes for all people in the region. o Key findings developed from the iCHNA and CHIP will be provided to iCHNA collaborative organizations to aid implementation of subsequent iCHNA and CHIP initiatives. Goals of the iCHNA Collaborative : o Conduct and complete a joint, participatory iCHNA for Revere, Chelsea , and Winthrop by September 30, 201 9. o Develop a n iCHNA Collaborative CHIP for Revere, Chelsea , and Winthrop that addresses priorities and identifies opportunities for shared investment and programming by the partners for the period of 2019 -2021 . o Monitor and evaluate CHIP strategies for pr ogress and impact to continuously inform implementation . o Communicate to , and engage in the process with, municipal and organizational leadership, community stakeholders , and the public throughout the assessment, planning , and implementation period . o Create iCHNA and CHIP reports that will, at a minimum, meet IRS, Attorney General, Accountable Care Organization (ACO), Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB), Determination of Need (DoN), and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) requirements. To plan and conduct the iCHNA process through its multiple phases, the Steering Committee created several subcommittees --Instrument Review, Community Engagement, Data Analysis --and working groups were then created to develop CHIP initiatives around priorit y issues that emerged from the assessment. Throughout the entire process, participation on the various committees and in the working groups was enthusiastic and productive, which is a testament to the collaborative spirit of the participants and their comm itment to the wellbeing of residents of the three communities. Emphasis on Inclusion and Recognition of Social Determinants of Health From the outset of the iCHNA and CHIP, collaborators were determined to include the needs of population segments that ar e sometimes hidden, overlooked, marginalized , or stigmatized. Members of such groups may never present at health centers, may not feel welcome or understood when they do , or may not feel comfortable revealing information about themselves that is important to their health care. The iCHNA North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 6 Instrument Review Subcommittee created a list of such population segments and conducted targeted key informant interviews and focus groups to ensure inclusion of these segments and those who work with them. The health statu s and medical conditions of patients can be directly or indirectly related to poverty, inadequate or unsafe housing, food insecurity and other social determinants of health. This is certainly true in the communities of Chelsea, Revere , and Winthrop, wh ere residents come from a wide range of income levels and degree of advantage or disadvantage. Daunting as such social determinants can be, the iCHNA working groups committed themselves to viewing population segments holistically and considering where they cou ld have an impact locally on the difficult issues affecting quality of life and health of community residents. Selecting Priorities and Next Steps After reviewing the primary and secondary data and taking into consideration impact, feasibility, and resour ces, the Steering Committee voted on the top three health concerns they felt could be address through a regional collaborative process. The health concerns that will be addressed over the next three years will be Housing, Economic Stability and Mobility, and Behavioral Health. Workings groups have been formed to set goals, objectives, and strategies, and begin action plans for each concern. A full Community Health Implementation Plan will be published later in 2019. North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 7 The North Suffolk 2019 Community He alth Needs Assessment Report What is a Community Health Needs Assessment ? A community health needs assessment (CHNA) refers to the process of engaging community members, community -based organizations, hospitals, and health systems in order to improve a c ommunity's health and identify a community's strengths. In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was passed, which required hospitals to conduct CHNAs every three years. Additionally, the Massachusetts Attorney General publishes Community Be nefit guidelines which include CHNAs every 3 years. Although only hospitals and health systems are mandated to complete a CHNA, CHNAs should engage a range of community organizations as health status and quality of life are impacted by a variety of forces . For instance, it is impossible to tackle the clinical ramifications of poor housing quality in a community without also tackling the community's poor housing quality itself. Thus, to conduct a comprehensive and robust CHNA, diverse community participatio n is needed to accurately discern the community's health priorities and develop a strategic and thoughtful implementation plan that addresses these priorities. When hospitals and other health systems collaborate with existing community -based organizations , the combined knowledge between clinical and community spheres can be leveraged to promote healthy behaviors and lifestyles for community members in new and more efficient ways. These relationships between clinical and community organizations can also fue l more grant applications, more upstream public health action, and more reinforcement for a community -wide perspective to health. This is what the iCHNA intended to do --create an inclusive assessment process that engaged stakeholders to identify root cau ses of health concerns and address them in a collaborative manner. Healthy Community , Social Determinants of Health, and Health Equity There are many definitions of a healthy community. For some, healthy communities emphasize low rates of chronic and infe ctious diseases or low mortality and morbidity rates. For others, healthy communities are those where people have access to favorable social and emotional opportunities such as education, employment, housing, stable families , and healthcare. For the iCHNA, a healthy community is defined as one where individuals from all backgrounds and circumstances have every opportunity to live a healthy life; and where local governments, health care providers, social service and community -based organizations , and communi ty residents work in continuous partnership to improve health outcomes for all people in the region. North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 8 Based on data from the 2019 Quality of Life survey, the three communities agreed on four aspects of a healthy community: access to health care, affordabl e housing, good schools , and low crime and low violence/safe neighborhoods. However, on a deeper community dive, each community had one aspect that ranked as their community's fi fth most important healthy community concern which did not make the top five h ealthy community aspects of the other two communities. For example, Chelsea's fifth most important aspect of a healthy community was access to healthy food. For Revere, the fifth most important aspect was effective city services such as water, trash, fire department , and police services. For Winthrop, their fifth most important aspect was a clean environment. This shows that , even regionally , it is difficult to create an all -encompassing definition of a healthy community. Although there is no ultimate def inition of a healthy community, viewing a community through the lens of its social determinants of health (SDoH) aids us in understanding its health status and determining what kinds of actions could be taken to improve it. SDoHs are those factors that cre ate environments that are either protective and supportive or harmful and detrimental for individuals and families to grow and age. These factors include childhood experiences, quality and affordable housing, educational opportunities, social support, inco me stability and mobility, employment opportunities, and access to healthcare services. As communities and organizations conduct CHNAs, the prominent requisites for communities to be healthier either are, or are related to, SDoHs. Health equity means tha t everyone has a fair opportunity to be as healthy as possible. This requires removing or reducing obstacles to good health such as poverty and discrimination and their consequences (including powerlessness and lack of access to good jobs with fair pay ), quality education and housing, safe environments, and health care. The iCHNA and CHIP process took into consideration the SDoH and health equity when creating data collection instruments and protocols, recruiting committee and subcommittee members and part icipants, collecting qualitative data, and reviewing best practices to address the health needs of North Suffolk residents. Establishment of the North Suffolk Public Health Collaborative in 2016 The NSPHC was created in 2016 by the chief executives of th e three adjacent communities of Revere, Chelsea , and Winthrop, which constitute the northern portion of Suffolk County. The mission of the NSPHC is to work with community stakeholders --city and town officials, municipal departments, health care and social service providers, community groups, etc. --to identify shared public health challenges and opportunities to collaborate productively on selected issues. Although the communities have significant differences in demographics and specific health issues, they also have common characteristics, offering the possibility of addressing some issues more effectively through working together rather than separately. In addition, like much of the United States, North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 9 the populations of the three communities have become increas ingly ethnically diverse, an important factor for consideration in planning for health care and human services that meet evolving community needs. In drawing up the inter -municipal agreement to establish the Collaborative, the Mayor of Revere, City Man ager of Chelsea , and Town Manager of Winthrop received technical assistance from the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC), a regional planning agency serving much of Eastern Massachusetts. MAPC's areas of focus include public health and cross -jurisdic tional collaborations , and the agency continues to offer guidance to the Collaborative. To coordinate the NSPHC's activities, the three communities agreed to fund a dedicated position, the NSPHC director, who works with staff of the three municipalities, t heir boards of health and health departments, local provider organizations , and other community health -related stakeholders. The NSPHC and the Impetus for the 2019 North Suffolk Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment and Community Health Improvement Plan Several months after the NSPHC began operations, hospitals serving Revere, Chelsea , and Winthrop were gearing up to conduct their individual community health needs assessments and plan for community health improvement programming which were due to go vernment agencies in 2019. Most hospitals conduct assessments every three years to comply with federal and state requirements for community engagement and programming designed to target local needs, including those of underserved populations. The timing of the 2019 round of assessments presented a special opportunity. The Mayor, City Manager and Town Manager, of the three NSP HC communities asked the hospitals to depart from their customary practice and conduct the assessments jointly and collaboratively. Th eir intention was to develop a more comprehensive , shared understanding among all parties of the needs of all three communities and seek opportunities to work together to address them. The NSPHC director co -coordinated the year -long iCHNA and CHIP process with a senior director at the Center for Community Health Improvement of Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the collaborating hospital systems. The work of the iCHNA Steering Committee and various project subcommittees has resulted in this report and working groups which are developing goals, objectives , and proposed initiatives for collaborative involvement over the next three years and beyond. Going forward, it is anticipated that the NSPHC director will take a lead role in coordinating and convening partnering organizations around selected initiatives emerging from the working groups. North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 10 The North Suffolk Region and the Communities Involved Suffolk County, Massachusetts , includes the cities of Boston, Revere, and Chelsea, and the town of Winthrop. In this report, North Suffolk refers to the latter three communities north of Boston: Revere, Chelsea, and Winthrop. Revere is a city located approximately 5 miles (8.0 km) from downtown Boston. Founded as North Chelsea in 1846, it was renamed in 1871 after the American Revolutionary War patriot Paul Revere. Revere Beach is the oldest public beach in the United States. Chelsea is a city directly across the Mystic River from the city of Boston. It is the second most densely populated city in Massachusetts behind Somerville. With a total area of just 2.21 square miles, Chelsea is the smallest city in Massachusetts in terms of total area. Chelsea is a diverse, working -class community that contains a high level of industrial activity. It is one of only three Massachusetts cities in which the majority of the population identifies as Hispanic or Latino . Winthrop is an oceanside suburban communit y situated at the north entrance to Boston Harbor, close to Logan International Airport. It is located on a peninsula, 1.6 square miles (4.2 km2) in area, connected to Revere by a narrow isthmus . Settled in 1630, Winthrop is one of the oldest communities in the United States. It is also one of the smallest and most densely populated municipalities in Massachusetts. Comm unity Demographics and Characteristics Winthrop Chelsea Revere MA Population 17,962 37,581 65.40% 82.20% 89.8% Percent Population 2.70% 35% 5% 2.90% North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 11 Assessment Approach From the outset , the intention of the North Suffolk iCHNA Collaborative was to collect accurate information and create a regional p lan to guide the municipalities, service providers, public and private organizations, and health systems that serve the area. To be effective, these plans would be: Comprehensive: Involving a full range of stakeholders, data, and a broad definition of hea lth and wellbeing to create a CHNA and CHIP that would reflect the needs of all community residents . Inclusive: Ensur ing all segments of the population would have a voice in the process, data collection, and implementation plan . Data -considered: Gathering extensive primary and secondary data on the health, wellbeing, and quality of life of residents through qualitative and quantitative methods . Collaborative: Guiding and engaging stakeholders throughout the process for sound decision making, co - learning, and transparency . In order to meet these values, the iCHNA was led by a Steering Committee . The Steering Committee was a selected group of leaders, including the chief executive s of the communit ies, a representative of each board of health, leaders of community organizations, and representatives from the five health systems that serve the area. If a key population segment was missing from the committee, specific agencies or representative s were recruited. The Steering Committee set direction and policy a nd had authority over priorities and implementation plans. The Steering Committee met every other month throughout the iCHNA and CHIP process. The meetings were listed on the iCHNA website , and subcommittee members were invited as well. A \"Segment Inclus iveness and Social Determinants of Health\" list ( Appendix F) was created in collaboration with the Steering Committee and the subcommittees. When reviewing membership on the subcommittees , as well as collecting primary data, this list was consulted to ensu re the iCHNA process and data collection were inclusive and representative. When planning for key informant interviews and focus groups, this list was used to identify individuals and groups to ensure that a variety of diverse individuals across sectors an d populations were included . North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 12 Assessment Timeline The iCHNA began with an initial meeting of stake holders on July 25, 2018 to review goals, process, and intentions. The official kickoff of the iCHNA was October 18, 2018. Methodology 1. Steering Com mittee: The Steering Committee established several subcommittees to carry out tasks associated with the phases of the iCHNA and CHIP process. 2. Instrument Review Subcommittee : Fifteen people represent ing different organizations joined the subcommittee. The purpose of this committee was to create, review, and finalize the survey instrument, as well as the focus group and key informant interview guides. The subcommittee met four times to review past instruments, offer new questions in which to gather data, a nd assess the survey tool for literacy level . The fourth meeting was a joint meeting with the Community Engagement Subcommittee to brainstorm ways to distribute the survey and identify key informant interviews and organizations to assist with focus groups. 3. Community Engagement Subcommittee : Eighteen people represent ing different organizations joined the subcommittee. The purpose of the subcommittee was to identify organizations who had access to populations who might not otherwise be engaged in this proces s without intentional outreach. Members of the subcommittee, along with Steering Committee members, created a database of 180 organizations and individuals as possible contacts for outreach. They were also charged with recommending community engagement st rategies, identifying potential community facilitators, reaching out to organizations and individuals for survey distribution and focus group coordination , and supporting the communications of Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Engage community & collect new data (primary data) Prioritizatio n Meetings CHIP Working Groups Aug Sep Complete Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) Report Review existing data (secondary data) Complete CHNA Report Sep Oct Nov Dec 2018 Steering Committee Kick-Off Subcommittee Meetings Kick-off 2019 North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 13 the process and final products. The subcommittee met four times , with the fourth meeting being a joint meeting with the Instrument Review Subcommittee. 4. Data Analysis Subcommittee: Eleven people represent ing different organizations in the assessment process joined the subcommittee. The purpose of the subcommittee was to help analyze the data, present the findings back to the Steering Committee, and determine how the data would appear in the reports. Members participated in three meetings to provide guidance on how the data should be organized, subpopulations to focus on, and how the data would be presented to the Steering Committee. The subcommittee determined the data should be organized based on the MA Department of Public Health (DPH ) Determination of Need (DoN) Health Priorities and the current MA Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS)/DPH focus issues : DPH DoN Health Prioritie s EOHHS/DPH Focus Issues Social Environment Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) Built Environment Housing Stability/Homelessness Housing Mental Illness and Mental Health Violenc e and Trauma Chronic Disease with a Focus on Cancer, Heart Disease and Diabetes Employment Education The Data Analysis S ubcommittee also decided to focus on three specific populations of interest: 1. Youth, 2. Seniors, and 3. Foreign -born. The subcom mittee provided feedback on the data that was included on \"data placemats \" to present to the Steering Committee. Data placemats are a tool to communicate with stakeholders the key data themes and engage them in data interpretation (Pankaj, Veena , October 2 014. \"Data Placemats: A DataViz Technique to Improve Stakeholder Understanding of Evaluation Results.\" Paper presented at the American Evaluation Association Annual Conference, Denver, CO). 5. Website and Cable Access Panel: To promote the iCHNA and CHIP process, keep communities up to date, and house the links to the survey, a website was created: www.northsuffolkassessment.com . The website URL was widely distributed through emails and flyers with the website, emails, and flyers all available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Arabic. To promote the website and the survey, a 12 -minute cable access panel discussion was recorded and widely distributed. The panel feature d the chief executive s of the com munities and was facilitated by the director of the Revere CARES Coalition, who also interpreted the content into Spanish. 6. Quality of Life Survey : The anonymous survey assessed community perceptions of quality of life, health problems in the community, co mmunity strengths, safety, community changes and demographic information (including perceptions of personal health, food and housing stability, and utilization of local resources). The survey was translated into Spanish, Portuguese, and Arabic, and was dis tributed widely via the web and in person within each participating organization. As an incentive, respondents who were willing to provide an email address or phone number were entered into a drawing for one of six $50 supermarket gift cards. A total of 1, 827 individuals across Revere, Chelsea, and Winthrop responded to the survey. The survey was cleaned and analyzed in the statistical software, R. After cleaning, 99% of the data were still usable, making the total North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 14 sample size of the community health surve y 1,819. The data w ere stratified by community, live or work, age, sex, race, Hispanic/Latino, and foreign -born. The full quantitative analysis is available in Appendix C. 7. Focus Groups : Qualitative data were collected through key informant interviews and focus groups with the help of a small group of volunteers from partner organizations and the CCHI Evaluation Team. Volunteers were trained on facilitation and note -taking strategies in February 2019 prior to the start of qualitative data collection. Inter view and focus group guides were created for facilitators and note -takers , with standard questions regarding perceptions about the health of the community, community assets, and pressing health issues. Once trained, volunteers traveled to participating org anizations to facilitate focus groups. Key informant interviews were conducted both in person and on the phone based on facilitator and interviewee availability. Potential focus group participants and key informants were identified by the North Suffolk I ntegrated Community Health Needs Assessment Steering Committee using a segment inclusiveness worksheet to ensure that a variety of diverse individuals across multiple sectors and populations were included. A total of 22 focus groups were completed, 9 with staff and 13 with community residents, and 28 key informant interviews were conducted, resulting in a combined total of 241 people engaged through this process. Four focus groups were conducted in Spanish. Each interview/focus group lasted approximately 45 to 60 minutes. Community residents received a $15 gift card at the end of the focus groups as compensation for their time. A full list of focus groups and interviews are in Appendix B. Upon completion of all focus groups and key informant interviews, t he notes were read, reviewed, and coded to categorize the data and identify overarching, common themes. Several themes were found across all three communities, while a few additional themes were found applicable to one or two communities. The full qualitat ive analysis is available in Appendix C. 8. Public Health Data : Public health data were gathered from the U.S. Census, MA Department of Education, MA Department of Public Health, local Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), Prevention Needs Assessment (PNA), loc al police departments and community -based organizations. Limitations As with all field research, there are several data limitations to report. This assessment sought to obtain diverse participation in the community. Every effort was made to ensure bro ad distribution of the Quality of Life survey so that all groups in the community were represented. Despite the concerted community outreach effort, t he majority of survey respondents were white females . However, there was a sufficient sample within each c ommunity to allow for analysis by sub -groups (e.g. , male vs. female, Hispanic/Latino). Focus groups were conducted in the communities to obtain the perspectives of youth, parents, immigrants, and non -English speakers, who were all less likely to respond to surveys. North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 15 Findings Presented below are key data gathered during the iCHNA process that support the prioritized health needs of the communities . They include primary and secondary data, with citations as appropriate. More data can be found in Appendix D. Community Characteristics The combined population of the three communities is 109,440, with Revere being the largest, (53,165), then Chelsea (38,244), and Winthrop the smallest (18,031) (ACS, 2012 -2016). Data Source : American Community Survey (ACS), 2012 -2016 Resilience was mentioned several times as a community strength in Chelsea and Revere. Participants in both communities reported that the populations they work with , or are a part of , are strong -willed and have a desire to access services to improve, despite the adversity some have faced. One participant in a staff focus group stated, \"Despite the lack of access to resources, they do their best to try to receive help.\" Key informants and focus group participants stated that patients often advocate for themselves to try to obtain useful resources. In addition, participants mentioned that there is a strong sense of community pride in all communities. Thus, it is evident that focus group participants and key informa nts believe that the people in these communities are key assets. 53,165 38,244 18,031 Revere Chelsea WinthropTotal Population \"It is a resilient city that overcomes its obstacles and perseveres\" - Revere Focus Group Participant North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 16 Multiple focus group participants readily and repeatedly talked about the rich diversity of people in Chelsea and Revere and the increase of ethnic ally and cultural ly diverse groups without a lot of racial tension. According to one focus group participant in Chelsea regarding diversity, \"We are an immigrant city, you get to know about different people and make friends. I belong to a lot of groups.\" Additionally, one focus group participant i n Chelsea stated, \"I don't feel that, when I walk in Chelsea, people will judge me because of who I am .\" Many participants also talked about the wide range of restaurants representing a vast array of cultures in their communities, an advantage that other c ommunities do not have. Participants across focus groups reported a desire to create more cultural events and ways to celebrate the diversity in Chelsea and Revere by uniting all of the different ethnic and racial groups so they are not isolated in their o wn groups. Ultimately, participants really embrace this distinct quality of Chelsea and Revere . Additionally, focus group participants stated that the b each in Winthrop is beautiful, and that the beach in Revere helps to bring the community together. One youth participant stated, \"There are people from other cities that come to the beach; you get to learn about other people's cultures and it exposes us to different things that people in other cities that are predominantly White don't get\". It is apparent that the beach not only aesthetical ly enhances Revere and Winthrop; it also serves as a common meeting place for people both inside and outside of these c ommunities.

Additionally, English proficiency is vastly different across the commu nities. Chelsea by far has the highest percentage of residents who do not speak English at all (11%) or do not speak English well (18%). Chelsea schools are also working with many students (38%) who are English language learners .

For the region, the top 5 health concerns were Substance Use (74%), Environmental Concerns (47%), Mental Health (45%), Housing (36%), and Aging Problems (26%). However, when broken down my community, the top 5 change slightly. Ch elsea and Revere's top 5 health concerns at the same, although in different order.

At a special meeting of Steering Committing on June 6, 2019, a multi -stage, facilitated process was empl oyed to review, discuss , and prioritize issues. Placemats for all the above issues were distributed and reviewed. Then, in breakout groups, participants discussed the issues from the perspective of three criteria: 1. Impact & Feasibility: Assuming we had re sources, is it realistic that working on this issue could achieve short -term or long -term change? 2. Sufficient Resources: Is it possible to address this issue given existing or anticipated infrastructure, capacity, funding, and political will? 3. Collaboration: Are there already groups working on this issue? Are there existing groups across sectors willing and able to work together on this issue? Finally, after each breakout group reported out their discussions to the room, participants voted with colored dots on the themes they felt offered the greatest opportunities for collaborations. Three priority areas emerged: Housing - including affordability , quality, stability , gentrification , and displacement . Behavioral Health - including youth mental health and su bstance use disorders . Economic Stability & Mobility - including employment, job training , and education . Although the Steering Committee narrowed the focus to three priority areas, other significant themes pertaining to community wellbeing (e.g. environm ent-related health concerns, food insecurity and chi ldhood obesity ) present potential opportunities for additional multi - community collaborations that may be explored by interested participants. North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 20 Housing One of the strongest themes running through the quantitative and quali tative data was the concern around housing in North Suffolk. Based on the Quality of Life Survey, 36% of all respondents identified housing as a top-ten health concern. Survey respondents from Chelsea ranked housing as second among health concern s. This is in marked contrast with Chelsea's 2015 Quality of Life Survey in which housing did not appear among the top five health concern s. Survey respondents from Revere ranked housing fourth among health concern s. Similar to Chelsea, in 2015, Revere survey respon dents did not previously identify housing as a top health concern. In both the 2014 and 2019 Quality of Life Survey, Winthrop respondents did not rank housing as part of their top five health concerns; however, housing did have a change in ranking in Winth rop from #10 (2014) to #6 (2019) . The changes of how housing was ranked between 2014 to 2019 as a health priority indicates that Chelsea, Revere and Winthrop survey respondents are noticing that housing affects not only their finances and where they live, but that housing also affects their health. As one of the most intricate social determinants of health, housing issues cause a cascade of effects on individuals. The housing issue in North Suffolk, based on our secondary and primary data, can be split in to two categories: housing quality and affordab ility of housing. Housing quality pertains to the quality of life experienced by those who rent or own as well as the built housing environment. Affordable housing is related to the effects of rising housing c osts and subsequent consequence s of increased eviction rates and homelessness. Housing Quality: According to the American Community Survey (ACS) data from 2012 to 2016, approximately 38% of all housing units in Massachusetts were renter -occupied. On a de eper community dive, 76% of all housing units in Chelsea were renter -occupied, 52% of all housing in Revere were renter -occupied , and 43% of all housing units were renter -occupied compared to the 38% of Massachusetts's housing units being renter - occupied. Without stratifying the Quality of Life Survey, 54% of survey respondents stated that they are homeowners. When these results were stratified by community, 53% of Chelsea respondents are renters while the majority of respondents from Revere and Winthrop ar e homeowners (54% are homeowners in Revere , and 71% are homeowners in Winthrop). Percent Owner -Occupied and Renter -Occupied Units, 2012 -2016 Data Source: Renter -Occupied Units North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 21 Renting can present multiple sources of str ess for North Suffolk individuals. For instance, focus group participants who rent units mentioned that necessary repairs , like broken doors, are hardly ever completed , and landlords can be negligent when it comes to making any improvements to apartments. According to ACS data on renter -occupied units by race/ethnicity from 2012 -2016, the majority of individuals who are renting units in Chelsea, Revere , and Winthrop are minority populations such as Hispanic/Latino, Black/African American, Asian, Multi -race and/or other race, American Indian, and Pacific Islander. Chelsea -based community health workers (CHWs) who work with diverse and foreign populations discussed the existence of \"slumlords\" in the community. Slumlords are landlords who do not maintain adeq uate housing conditions for their tenants. The CHWs expressed that their patients who are immigrants hesitate to complain about these slumlords because of their immigrant status and, thus, remain living in substandard housing conditions. North Suffolk al so has high rates of housing built before 1978, which present s issues with lead for growing families. In Massachusetts, 71% of housing units were built prior to 1978; however, 79% of housing units were built prior to 1978 in Chelsea, 74% of housing units w ere built prior to 1978 in Revere , and 90% of housing units were built prior to 1978 in Winthrop. Based on data from Massachusetts Environmental Public Health Tracking, the percent of children screened for lead were at higher rates in North Suffolk in comp arison to the percent of children screened for lead in Massachusetts . Percent of Children Screened for Lead and Percent of Children with Elevated Blood Lead Levels Data Source: Massachusetts Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT) Affor dable Housing: Many focus group participants, particularly from Chelsea and Revere, echoed each other in saying that the cost of housing is continually increasing, which, in turn, increases the rate of gentrification and evictions. Fifty -six percent of sur vey respondents from Chelsea, Revere and Winthrop defined a healthy community as one with affordable housing. As gentrification and eviction rates rise, newer, more affluent populations enter the community as low -and-middle income community residents are f orced to exit. As the housing prices increase, more households are finding themselves being \"cost burdened,\" meaning that individuals are paying 30 to 50% of their monthly income on housing. From 2012 to 2016 ACS data, 37% of all households \u2014 both owner and renter households \u2014 indicated that they were cost burdened throughout the state while 41% of households in Chelsea, 51% of households in Revere and 47% of households in Winthrop identified themselves as being cost -burdened . \"If the housing situ ation was better and people could spend more time at home rather than working to afford their housing, they would be able to spend more time meal prepping, eating healthier foods, and connecting with the community.\" -Chelsea Focus Group Participant Focus Group Participant North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 22 Percent of All households, Ow ner households, and Renter Households Experiencing Cost Burdening Data Source: American Community Survey (ACS), 2012 -2016 These rising costs perpetuate fear in these communities \u2014fear of foreclosure, eviction and homelessness. Based on the eviction rates calculated by Eviction Lab (a database of evictions supported by Princeton University) from 2008 to 2016 , within the three communities of North Suffolk, there are peaks in eviction rates around 2012 and 2015. Around 2016, for Revere and Winthrop, the evic tion rates seem to be decreasing; while in Chelsea, the eviction rates appear to be increasing. Eviction Rates, 2008 - 2016 Data Source: Eviction Lab, https://evictionlab.org/ Compared to 11% of non -Hispanic/Latino survey respondents, 23% of Hispan ic-Latino survey respondents fear that they will be evicted or foreclosed due to lack of rent or mortgage payment. As individuals are evicted or have their homes foreclosed, they risk experiencing homelessness. Approximately 44% of Revere respondents fear that they will become homeless in the next year, followed by 30% of Chelsea respondents and 23% of Winthrop respondents. The Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education's Office of Student and Family Support estimated that throughout th e 2017 to 2018 school year, Chelsea had 463 homeless youth, Revere had 191 homeless youth and Winthrop had 14 homeless youth. Homeless youth are identified if their primary nighttime residence consists of either shelters, doubled -up, unsheltered (cars, par ks, etc.), or hotels. Without good quality and affordable housing, healthy behaviors and lifestyles are difficult to sustain. 1.912.262.18 1.54 0.171.32.01 1.52 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Revere Winthrop47% 42%49%51% 45%57% HouseholdsChelsea Revere Winthrop MANorth Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 23 Mental Health & Substance Use Mental health and substance use disorders have been identified as community health priorities for several years. The table below illustrates the changes in survey respondents ranking of mental health and substance use disorders from 2014, 2015 and 2019. Data Source: 2019 Quality of Life Survey Since 2014, in all three communities, the percentage of survey respondents selecting substance use disorders/issues and mental health as priorities have increased. Overall, among the three communities, 74% of all survey respondents selected alcohol/dru g use/addiction/overdose as the top health concern and 45% of all survey respondents identified mental health as one of the top three health concerns. Though all communities had these issues among their top five health priorities previously, there are now more individuals in agree ment that more resources and services are needed in these areas or that these issues are becoming more prominent in their communities. Substance Use Disorders As the top overall health concern for survey respondents and focus g roup participants, individuals in North Suffolk feel that substance use remains a pervasive issue in their communities that affects multiple areas of residents' lives. According to the Office of Statistics and Evaluation from the MA Bureau of Substance Add iction Services (BSAS), from fiscal year 2008 to 2018, the total number of treatment admissions for all substance use disorders into publicly funded treatment facilities decreased in both Revere and Winthrop but increased in Chelsea.

However, in Chelsea and Revere, from 2008 to 2018, both communities saw an increase in the percent of individuals who were admitted for treatment for alcohol use (29% to 32% in Chelsea and 21% to 30% in Revere). Both Revere and Chelsea are now at or above the state -wide percentage of individuals admitted for alcohol treatment. Between 2008 and 2018, Winth rop's percent of individuals admitted for treatment decreased from 29% to 24%. Opioids: In the three communities of North Suffolk, the percentage of individuals admitted for heroin treatment decreased between fiscal year s 2008 and 2018 while , statewide, those who were admitted for heroin treatment increased from 37% to 44%. Primary Drug of Use: Heroin, Percent of BSAS Admissions, FY 2008 - 2018 Data Source : Treatment statistics prepared by the Office of Statistics and Evaluation, Bureau of Substanc e Addiction Services, MDPH As concerns about the opioid epidemic continue to grow, the number of opioid -related overdose deaths also continue to grow. According to the Massachusetts Registry of Vital Records and Statistics from Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH), in 2013, the number of opioid -related overdose deaths were: 7 in Chelsea, 15 in Revere, and 2 in Winthrop. By 2017, Chelsea's number of opioid -related overdose deaths was 14. The highest peak was in 2015 when the city saw 18 individu als die due to opioid -related overdoses between 2013 to 2017 , the number of opioid was 15. By 2017, the number of opioid -related deaths was 24. The highest peak of opioid -related deaths was in 2016, when the city of Revere ha d 26 individuals 667 7521267 1048 328 305 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 10 13 14 15 16 17 18Chelsea Revere Winthrop MANorth Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 25 die due to opioid -related overdoses. In Winthrop 2013, the number 2017, the overdose deaths was 10. Ten opioid overdoses was the highest amount of deaths Winthrop witnesse d between 2013 to 2017. In all of these communities, opioid -related deaths appear to be a persistent problem. Obstacles to Treatment: There are many obstacles for community members who have substance use disorders to receive the clinical and social/emoti onal services they need : One of the most challenging obstacles is stigma. Many focus group participants and key informants from Winthrop and Revere shared that stigma forces community residents suffering with substance use disorders not to be open about t heir battles with substances. Residents will see needles or know of someone's family member who has used substances, but that individual will not admit it because they feel ashamed and prefer to keep the issues to themselves. Youth in Revere mentioned that they see individuals who do not get help, but instead mask the issue until it becomes a much bigger issue and, thus, creates more problems for the individual. Another obstacle individuals face on the road to recovery is once they have accepted that they need, or want, help, there is a shortage of accessible, affordable and available providers. Twelve percent of Chelsea survey respondents stated that they needed substance use services, but were not able to access them. Six percent of Revere respondents an d two percent of Winthrop respondents also needed substance use disorder services, but were not able to access them. Compared to 0.7% of non - Hispanic/Latino survey respondents, 24% of Hispanic/Latino survey respondents stated that they needed substance use disorder services, but could not access them. Although respondents did not have the option in the survey to say why they could not access these services, there is a huge demand for substance use disorder services that are culturally and linguistically com petent. Another obstacle individuals face when seeking treatment is the reality that these substance use issues do not occur in silos. If individuals are also experiencing homelessness , for example, and need mental health services, it is much harder to st ick to a treatment regimen. BSAS collects enrollment characteristics of individuals who are admitted, such as homelessness at enrollment. Homelessness at enrollment is defined as those who completed an intake within 14 days prior to enrollment and reported their address as being \"Home, homeless.\" If there was no address type available within 14 days of a completed intake, or if the address type was unable to establish certain homelessness status, then homelessness was determined by what the individuals put when asked about whether they rent or own an apartment or where they slept last night. According to BSAS enrollment characteristics for fiscal year 2017, 33% of all individuals from Chelsea seeking treatment were experiencing homelessness at enrollment. 22 % of all individuals from Revere seeking treatment were experiencing homeless ness and 18% of all individuals from Winthrop seeking treatment were homeless at enrollment. Another obstacle is the intersection between substance use disorders and mental healt h. BSAS also collects information on whether individuals had prior mental health treatment. Thirty -nine percent of Chelsea residents enrolled for substance use disorders treatment had prior mental health treatment. Thirty -nine percent of Revere residents e nrolled for substance use disorders treatment had prior mental health treatment. Forty -seven percent of Winthrop residents enrolled for substance use disorders treatment in Chelsea had prior mental health treatment. Overdose : As more people begin to use d rugs for a myriad of reasons, more people also begin to overdose and consequently become hospitalized as well. According to the Massachusetts Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA), from 2007 to 2014, individuals from Chelsea, Revere and Winthro p had increased rates of heroin overdose hospitalizations. The rates are adjusted by age per 100,000. In 2007, Massachusetts had a statewide age-adjusted rate of heroin overdose hospitalization of 29 per 100,000. Chelsea had 47.2 per 100,000 and North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 26 Revere had 59 per 100,000 heroin overdose hospitalizations. For years 2007, 2008 and 2010, Winthrop's rates of heroin overdose hospitalization are suppressed due to confidentiality. During this time period (2007, 2008 and 2010), Winthrop is reported to have 108.8 p er 100,000 heroin overdose hospitalizations. In 2014, Massachusetts heroin overdose hospitalization age -adjusted rate increased to 105 per 100,000. In Chelsea 2014, the heroin overdose hospitalization rate increased to 116.7 per 1 00,000. In Revere 2014, the heroin overdose hospitalization rate increased to 171.7 per 100,000. Winthrop, who had one of the highest heroin overdose hospitalization rates between 2007 and 2010, had one of the lowest rates of heroin overdose hospitalizatio n with 87.2 per 100,000. Non -opioid overdose hospitalizations have higher age -adjusted rates than heroin overdose hospitalizations. Youth: With the legalization of marijuana and normalization of marijuana use, North Suffolk youth expressed during focus groups that there is a perception of less risk to using marijuana compared to other drugs. A youth participant mentioned that \"since marijuana has been legalized, the youth have been using it more. Sometimes, I have found youth using marijuana treating it like a game, like it's fun.\" Based on data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) from Chelsea (2015) and Revere (2017), Winthrop's similar version of the YRBS, the Prevention Needs Assessment (PNA) from 2018, and Massachusetts's Youth Health Survey (2 017), 10% of Winthrop middle school and high school youth reported using marijuana within the past 30 days compared to the 5% from Chelsea and Revere middle school youth and 2% of Massachusetts middle school youth .

Although the North Suffolk middle school youth are using marijuana more often than the statewide percentage, the North S uffolk high school youth are using marijuana less often than the Massachusetts high school youth (19% of Chelsea high school youth, 18% of Revere high school youth, 10% of Winthrop's combined middle and high school youth vs 24% of MA high school youth) Another growing concern for youth due to perceived reduced harm is the increased use of electronic vapor products, otherwise known as vaping. Health officials and school administrators have recognized underage vaping as an epidemic, with even younger teens b ecoming addicted to nicotine, which is harmful to developing brains. Youth focus group participants mentioned that vaping is a huge concern for them as it has grown increasingly prevalent in their communities. Youth even mention that students use it on sch ool property and in front of teachers. One young person from a Revere focus group mentioned that they saw a student \"take a hit \" from a JUUL in class while the teacher was looking at the student because the student was easily able to hide the JUUL in their sweatshirt. Youth , however, continue to share that they do not perceive the JUUL as being harmful or addictive as notice and that everyone is doing it. Percent of Middle and High School Students Reporting Using Electronic Vapor Products in Past 30 Day s Data Source: Chelsea YRBS, 2015; Revere YRBS, 2017; Winthrop PNA, 2018 The final area of concern for youth is the use of alcohol. Based on 2015 & 2017 YRBS, 2018 PNA, and 2017 MA Youth Health Survey, 4% of MA middle school youth reported drinking alcoh ol in the past 30 days compared to much higher rates in North Suffolk: 8% of Chelsea middle school youth , 8% of Revere middle school youth and a 20% combined rate of Winthrop middle school and high school youth drinking alcohol in the past 30 days. Thirty - one percent of MA high school youth reported drinking alcohol in past 30 days compared to 26% of Chelsea high school youth , 21% Revere high school youth , and 20% combined rate of Winthrop middle school and high school youth drinking alcohol in the past 30 days . Based on data from the 2015 and 2017 YRBS, 33.1% of Chelsea middle school youth and 42.1% of Revere middle school youth feel that the main reason why youth their age drink or use alcohol is to fit in. Though the opioid crisis is ongoing, other drug s and substances continue to pose a threat for the North Suffolk region , especially its youth. As solutions and plans are created, it is imperative to remember basic necessities for individuals at risk for these challenges : social and emotional support, a stable environment, proper education about the risk of harm of drugs, and, if needed, mental health resources and services. Mental Health In the 2014 and 2015 Quality of Life surveys, mental health was among all communities' top five health concerns, wi th percentages as low as 11% of survey respondents identifying that mental health was a health concern. In the 2019 Quality of Life survey, mental health was among the top three health concern for all communities, with percentages as high as 41% of survey respondents identifying that mental health was a health 2% 3% 9% 12% 19% 10% 20%Chelsea MS Chelsea HS Revere MS Revere HS Winthrop MS & HS MA MS MA HSChelsea MS Chelsea HS Revere MS Revere HS Winthrop MS & HS MA MS MA HSNorth Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 28 concern. More survey respondents identif ied mental health as a health concern which could be a result of more individuals feeling that they or their community have more mental health issues or there i s decreased stigma and more acceptance to acknowledging mental health as a concern. According to CHIA data on mental health admissions from 2007 to 2014, Chelsea, Revere and Winthrop had higher age -adjusted rates per 100,000 of mental health admissions i n 2007; whereas, in 2014, both Revere and Winthrop are below the state average admissions and Chelsea residents' mental health admissions increased. Mental Health Hospital Admissions, 2007 - 2014 Data Source: Center for Health Information and Analysi s (CHIA) -Each chronic disease indicator is calculated by analyzing the primary diagnosis code associated with the emergency department visit or hospitalization. The following ICD -9-CM diagnosis codes were used to identify Mental health: 290* -319* Mental h ealth was consistently mentioned across all focus groups. Specifically, help for depression and anxiety was brought up as a need that has gone unmet across several populations, including those in recovery or current substance users, youth, elders and veter ans, especially due to trauma. Additionally, focus group participants mentioned that North Suffolk residents are dealing with stress and pressure, but oftentimes mental health is not taken seriously. Th e feeling of social isolation was also brought up in o ther focus groups by community residents, which could be adding to the decreased mental health of the community. Key informant interviews shed light on the elderly and Muslim communities' social isolation. A key informant mentioned that Muslims stay in the ir own group and are isolated from the larger community. Elders also tend to be and live alone without any company. According to ACS data from 2012 to 2016, Chelsea, Revere and Winthrop all have higher percentages of elders, those who are 65 and older, who live alone compared to MA (45% in Chelsea, 34% in Revere and 38% in Winthrop versus 30% in MA). While 46% to 50% of North Suffolk survey respondents rat ed their satisfaction with social activities and relationships \"Very Good\" or \"Excellent,\" focus group s from all communities discussed the desire and need for more activities that bring the community together. One participant from Revere mentioned that Revere needs more activities that bring all of Revere together \u2014not just one particular age group or race/ ethnicity, but everyone so that individuals can meet others in their community and make more relationships within the community. Events like this could reduce the social isolation felt in North Suffolk and help promote better social and emotional well -bein g. Based on data from the 2015 & 2017 YRBS in Chelsea and Revere, the 2018 Winthrop PNA, and the 2017 MA Youth Health Survey, North Suffolk middle and high school youth reported feeling sad or hopeless for two weeks at higher percentages than MA middle a nd high school youth. 1351.8 1353.1 1024.7 915.61001.7 884.8891934 2007 2008 2009 2010 2013 2014Age-Adjusted rate per 100,000Chelsea Revere Winthrop MANorth Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 29 Percent of Middle and High School Students Reporting Feeling Sad or Hopeless for Two Weeks Data Source: 2015 Chelsea YRBS, 2017 Revere YRBS, 2018 Winthrop PNA, and 2017 MA Youth Health Survey Similar to substance use disorder services, there is also a lack of culturally and linguistically competent mental health providers and resources. Compared to 14.8% of non -Hispanic Latino survey respondents, 20.8% Hispanic/Latino survey respondents rated their mental health as being \"Poor\" or \"Fair.\" Focus group participants also touched on the influence of race and culture on mental health, stating that some races and cultures do not feel that mental health is an issue that affects them and if people are feeling sad, it is something that \"they should just get over. \" There can be a mentality that prevails among the residents of color or residents of different cultures that \"depression is for white people.\" Aside from cultural competency, there is a disheartening scarcity of mental health se rvices. A focus group participant discussed the long wait times that patients endure to receive care. Some individuals know that the wait times will be so long that they proclaim they are going to commit suicide in order to get care more rapidly. But, as t his focus group participant mentioned, \"No one should have to say, 'I'm going to kill myself' in order to get some service.\" While 9% of Massachusetts middle school youth and 12% of Massachusetts high school youth have seriously considered suicide, North S uffolk youth report higher rates of middle school youth seriously considering suicide. In Chelsea, 20% of their middle school youth have seriously considered suicide while 13% of their high school youth report seriously considering suicide. In Revere, 18% of their middle school youth have seriously considered suicide while 8% of their high school youth reported seriously considering suicide. In Winthrop, no comparison between middle school and high school youth can be made but their PNA reports a combined 14% of middle and high school youth reported seriously considering suicide. The care delivery method for mental health resources and services should be reformed in new and alternative ways so that more individuals of all ages, religions, races, ethnic gr oups, socio -economic backgrounds and sexual orientation who need mental health care are able to receive quality and affordable care quickly. 28%38% 26%28% 24% 19%27% Chelsea MS Chelsea HS Revere MS Revere HS Winthrop MS & HSMA MS MA HSChelsea MS Chelsea HS Revere MS Revere HS Winthrop MS & HS MA MS MA HSNorth Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 30 Economic Stability and Mobility According to the 2019 North Suffolk iCHNA Quality of Life survey, 23% of respo ndents selected poverty as a top health concern. In the 2014 and 2015 Quality of Life surveys, poverty was not considered a top five health concern for any of the North Suffolk communities. However, in 2019, 38% of Chelsea survey respondents and 28% of Rev ere survey respondents identified poverty among their most important health concerns. Impoverished residents are more likely to have worse health outcomes. Through the promoti on of more employment and educational attainment opportunities, among other inter ventions, individuals can be provided more access to better incomes which then cultivates a more financially stable community for all. With regard to economic status of the communities, t he Economic Hardship Index (EHI) ( Richard P. Nathan and Charles F. Adams, Jr. in \"Understanding Urban Hardship,\" Political Science Quarterly 91 (Spring 1976): 47 -62.), a combined measure of six variables , indicates that, compared with the statewide average EHI of 36.01, Chelsea (45.73) and Revere (38.44) have higher index es, while Winthrop fares better with an EHI of 28.58. Economic Hardship Index Winthrop Chelsea Revere MA Economic Hardship Index 28.58 45.73 38.44 36.01 Components $36,329 $21,722 $26,746 $39,463 Percent HS grad (over 25) 5.44 29.29 17.66 10.60 Percent unemployed (over 16) 4.92 5.58 6.95 6.31 Percent dependent (under 18 or over 65) 36.5 34.84 33.62 35.68 Percent in poverty (below FPL) 7.72 18.65 14.25 12.19 Percent Crowding (units with >1 person/roo m) 1.32 9.175 5.27 2.03 Notes: The Economic Hardship Index is a standardized index across all census tracts in Massachusetts. Higher scores indicate greater economic hardship. Employment: The working -age population is defined as individuals between the ages of 15 and 64. Based on ACS data from 2012 to 2016, 91% of Chelsea's age distribution is considered working age, 86% of Revere's population is considered working age, and 82% of Winthrop's population is considered working age. Additionally, the majorit y of households also have children, but, based on responses from the 2019 Quality of Life survey, 44% of Chelsea respondents, 38% of Revere respondents and 29% of Winthrop respondents with children ages 5 to 12 reported having difficulty finding after -scho ol programs. Without appropriate child care access, families risk being limited to one income earner as one parent may have to stay home to care for young children or not be able to work jobs without flexible work times or schedules. Focus group participan ts from Revere shared that many of them know of one or more people who have to work more than one job just to make ends meet. One Revere resident shared that many people have to do this because everything is so expensive. Another expressed concern that som e parents may be consequently neglecting their children because they are forced to work two to three jobs. Education: According to MA DESE, North Suffolk has higher rates of high school dropouts. Compared to MA's 2% high school dropout rate from the 20 17-2018 school year, Chelsea ha d a 7% high school dropout and Winthrop had a 4% high school dropout rate. Revere's high school dropout rate was the same as Massachusetts. In 2018, Revere and Winthrop ha d high school graduation rates fairly similar or the s ame as MA's high school graduation rate, whereas Chelsea had a much lower high school graduation rate of 67% vs. 88% in MA ). For rising seniors of the 2017 -2018 school year, the most common plan after graduation for both Chelsea and Revere youth was atten ding a 2 -year public college and their second most common plan was attending a 4-year public college. For Winthrop youth , the most common plan after graduation was to attend a 4-year private \"People are working 2 -3 jobs just to make ends meet. And those jobs aren't great \u2014they don't have good pay or benefits.\" -Key Informant North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 31 college and their second most common plan was to attend a 4-year public college. Th ese differences among youth of North Suffolk communities indicates the disparity of educational opportunities as more youth feel that they can attend, and afford, a private institution in Winthrop contrasted with Chelsea and Revere. Addit ionally, the third most common post -graduation plan for Chelsea youth was joining the workforce ; whereas , the third most common plan after graduation for Revere was attending a 4 -year private college and the third most common plan after graduation for Wint hrop was attending a 2 -year public college. Plans After Graduation, 2017 - 2018 School Year Plan Chelsea Revere Winthrop MA 4-Year Private DESE From 2012 to 2016 ACS data, 88% of Chelsea residents did not have a college degree compared to 67% of Revere residents who did not have a college degree and 35% of Winthrop residents did not have a college degree. Whether it was having an associate degree, bachelor's degree, attending some college or master 's degree of higher, Winthrop always had higher rates of post -secondary education attainment compared to Revere and Chelsea. North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 32 Educational Attainment, 2012 - 2016 Data Source: 2012 to 2016 ACS Income: A family or individual's income determines what kinds of foods, insurance, housing, utilities, clothing, and more, they are able to afford. According to ACS 2012 to 2016 data, the median household income for MA was $70,954. In North Suffolk, Winthrop's median household income was $62,997, Revere's was $51,482 and Chelsea's was $49,614. Racial and ethnic income inequality statewide and in North Suffolk is significant . Compared to the $70,954 median household income in MA, Black or African American MA residents have a median household income of $44,117. North Su ffolk Black or African American residents have somewhat higher household incomes in Chelsea ($46,000 ) and Revere ( $62,537) . Based on the median household income by race/ethnicity , in North Suffolk compared to MA and in almost every racial and ethnic catego ry, individuals of color have higher incomes in North Suffolk than MA, except Asian. However, certain population groups have a smaller, overall sample size so certain percentages may appear higher due the effect of a small sample size. Median Household I ncome by Race/Ethnicity, 2012 - 2016 Chelsea Revere Winthrop $49,164 $51,482 $62,997 $70,954 Black White alone $49,593 $49,439 $64,219 $75,387 Note: Certain population groups have a smaller overall N so certain percentages may appear high due the effect of a small sample size.

However, this does not mean that environmental concerns will not be addressed within the North Suffolk commun ities as all communities had environment in their respective community top 5 rankings of health concerns. Additionally, although childhood obesity and food insecurity were not directly chosen as priority areas to focus on, both of these issues present majo r issues to North Suffolk youth and families. Environmental concerns, childhood obesity and food insecurity are important issues to the North Suffolk community and to their health and will be addressed though they are not specifically targeted through the CHIP. Environmental Concerns While Chelsea and Revere residents have identified health concerns with the environment in both the 2015 and 2019 Quality of Life surveys, Winthrop has consistently identified the environment to be their primary and/or seco ndary health concern based on their 2014 and 2019 Quality of Surveys. As environment ranked in different places for all the North Suffolk communities, this suggests that the environmental effects on health might be more pertinent for some community members versus others and are still important to address within the iCHNA. Environmental concerns can touch on a wide range of issues. For instance, in Chelsea, a focus group participant mentioned that they have environmental concerns because of the amount of tr ash in Chelsea. In Revere, a focus group participant mentioned that they have environmental concerns because of the surplus of rats. In Winthrop, a focus group participant said the community ha d seen residents aged 40 -50 die from issues unrelated to substa nce misuse, but instead from issues related to environmental cancers and diseases. Based on the results from the 2019 Quality of Life survey, the table below shows how the region ranked their top five most important environmental concerns as well as how ea ch community ranked their top most important environmental health problems. \"You do not feel good about where you live if there's trash everywhere .\" -Chelsea Focus Group Participant North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 34 Regional Environmental Concerns Chelsea's Environmental Concerns Revere's Environmental Concerns Winthrop's Environmental Concerns 1 Outdoor Air Quality Trash/Litter Trash/Litter Airport and Airplanes 2 Trash/Litter Outdoor Air Quality Outdoor Air Quality Outdoor Air Quality 3 Airport and Airplanes Water Pollution Water Pollution Water Pollution 4 Water Pollution Airport and Airplanes Noise Noise 5 Noise Indoor Air Pollution Indoor Air Pollution Trash/Litter Data Source: 2019 Quality of Life Survey By simply examining the region's environmental concerns, Chelsea and Revere's community members' concerns on indoor air pollution would b e missed and the effect of airplanes and airports on Winthrop's community members would be underestimated. While environmental concerns can impact community members' lives through different mechanisms, the health concerns are still present in North Suffolk and are still an area to tackle in order to better the region's health. Childhood Obesity and Food Insecurity Childhood obesity has been a consistent and chronic concern for North Suffolk families and youth . According to the public school districts' da ta and from MDPH reports, Chelsea, Revere and Winthrop all have higher percentages of overweight or obese public school students compared to Massachusetts. Percent of Overweight or Obese Public School Students Grade Chelsea (2018 -19) Revere (2018 -19) Winthrop (2014 -15) MA (2014 -15) Chelsea Public Schools, Revere Public Schools, Winthrop Public Schools, & Massachusetts DPH While childhood obesity presents numerous downstream health complications for the individual, such as increased risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma, and depression, childhood obesity is also indicative of upstream public health concerns such as fo od insecurity. Focus group participants from Chelsea and Revere noted that there is little access to healthy and affordable food or restaurants compared to the overabundance of fast food restaurants. Survey respondents identified prices and quality of food as the main factors that affect where they shop for food. Additionally, all of the North Suffolk communities have more than half of their residents within the \"SNAP Gap. \" The SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) Gap is the difference between t he number of low -income Massachusetts residents receiving MassHealth who are likely SNAP eligible and the number of people who are actually receiving SNAP. If potentially eligible SNAP participants are not receiving SNAP benefits, this implies that there a re families who are struggling to pay for food for their household due to lack of funds and social support resources. This could result in families only being able to afford cheaper, and typically less nutritious, foods and perpetuating the cycle of childh ood obesity in the community. North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 35 Number of Residents Receiving SNAP versus Number of Residents who may be Eligible for SNAP SNAP SNAP Gap # Chelsea 8,097 11,551 Revere 7,943 13,027 Winthrop Massachuset ts, accessed: https://public.tableau.com/profile/food.bank.of.western.ma#!/vizhome/SNAPGap2018/DistrictData North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 36 Conclusion The Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment and the Community Health Improvement Plan that ultimately emerges from its finding s were made possible through the collegial spirit and generous investment of time and ideas by its many partners. Our health and social services providers, community officials, staff members of municipal departments and other collaborators always kept the wellbeing of the three communities' residents first and foremost in their sights as they worked together over a full year's time to conduct the assessment. We are grateful to everyone who touched this process and enhanced the results. In planning and cond ucting the iCHNA, we strove to be inclusive of the diverse segments of our communities both in establishing the committees that carried out the work and in our outreach to gather accurate, useful data about our residents. We believe the iCHNA and the CHIP priority issues that emerged are reflective of our strong community engagement. In this 2019 assessment, w e found via primary data collection that economic insecurity and housing cost issues are among our communities' highest areas of concern . This is supported by the secondary data for the communities. This is des pite frequent national news reports of record stock market highs and low unemployment rates. Many residents are working but still not able to keep up with the costs of living. A third area of concern is behavioral health, particularly substance use disorde rs and youth mental health. These concerns are almost identical with those found through a similar community health needs assessment being conducted in 2019 within the City of Boston. As mentioned earlier in this report, the municipal executives of Revere , Chelsea and Winthrop - the Mayor, City Manager and Town Manager - touched off the iCHNA in Spring 2018 when they requested that area health care providers conduct their upcoming assessments jointly for the first time. In addition to the initial spur of t his request, the CHIP will benefit from a new motivation for continuing collaboration over the next three years and beyond. The CHIP will create opportunities to identify 'low hanging fruit' initiatives that can be implemented immediately with few resource s, as well as initiatives needing funding to move forward. We anticipate that well thought -out proposals emanating from our CHIP working groups to address our region's needs stand a good chance of receiving funding to enable their implementation. This fu nding could be from federal and state resources, foundations, as well as new funding available to our communities for community health improvement via the Determin ation of Need funding mechanism administered by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health . The transition from the issuing of this report to the formation of working groups that are designing strategies to address priority concerns requires that we create a structure and processes that can support our efforts over the next several years. To that end, throughout 2019 and 2020 we will work together to create a sustainable foundation for meeting, decision -making and tracking our work. Based on the robust participation of all parties over the past year, we look forward optimistically to ongoing collaboration that will have measurable, positive impacts on the health and quality of life of residents of our three communities. North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 37 Next Steps: Community Health Implementation Plan (CHIP) Three CHIP working groups have been formed in response to the pr iority meeting: Behavioral Health, including mental health and substance use disorders with a focus on youth and families Economic Stability and Mobility Housing Affordability and Stability Each CHIP group met several times to create a goal, define three -year objectives, and brainstorm strategies to meet the objectives. At the behest of the Winthrop Board of Health, a working group to address Environmen t- related Health Concerns will be coordinated. Although it was not one of the top 3 priorities, it was a shar ed concern among residents of the communities . A full CHIP Action Plan will be published in Fall, 2019.

Analysis As mentioned, in order to collect a robust and comprehensive sample of survey respondents, surveys were avail able in multiple languages. The majority of participants took the English survey (92%), followed by the Spanish survey (7.40%), Portuguese survey (0.38%) and the Arabic survey (0.22%). Due to the low response rate of the Portuguese and Arabic surveys, they were re -translated to English using Survey Monkey. However, because over 100 surveys were completed in Spanish, they were translated to English using R. Though data analysis primarily focused on calculating the frequencies of responses per question, it was essential to ensure that the correct denominators were utilized. For most questions, the denominator calculated was based on the total number of individuals who responded to that particular question. However, when questions contained phrases such as \"S elect all that apply\" or other phrases directing respondents to select multiple choices, the statistical software SAS was used to determine how many individuals responded to these sets of questions. The denominator then became the total number of people wh o selected at least one response. Assuring that the correct denominators were used in the overall and stratified results ensures that our frequencies are as accurate and precise as possible. Since the survey was available to anyone who lived or worked in Chelsea, Revere or Winthrop, some analyses were done that solely focused on how residents of these communities responded. Residents were defined as those who responded that they either lived or lived and work in either Chelsea, Revere or Winthrop. The Data Analysis Subcommittee determined that the survey respondents who were foreign -born were a population of interest. The foreign -born population was defined as those who were residents (live , or live and work in community) and those who responded that they have lived in the United States within these parameters: \"Less than one year,\" \"one to three years,\" \"four to six years,\" or \"more than six years, but not my whole life.\" Those who responded that they have lived in the United States for their whole lives were defined as \"non -foreign born\" survey respondents. Youth were defined as those who responded that they were under 18 years old and seniors were defined as those who responded that they were 65 years old or older. While cleaning the data, the analyst found an interesting pattern that echoed changing reactions to choices offered U.S. Census respondents regarding race and ethnicity . Individuals who identified as Hispanic/Latino grappled to respond what race they identified as. The question pertaining to race came before the question asking whether individuals identified as Hispanic/Latino. 116 survey respondents selected \"other\" as their race and wrote in a response that indicated that they were of Hispanic/Latino descent. One individual even wrote \"Why i sn't Hispanic/Latino an option?\" North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 44 Qualitative Themes The following themes related to community strengths, barriers to accessing services and resources, and top health concerns were found across multiple focus groups and key informant interviews in Che lsea, Revere, and Winthrop. The breakdown of themes within these categories provides insight into how residents and stakeholders view the health of their communities, and what improvements could be made to strengthen community health. Some people expressed positive and negative views on the same issues , based on their own experiences . Although this might seem conflicting, we mention both opposing views to give voice to the experiences of the residents. While some themes are applicable to all three communiti es, or two out of three communities, there are a few themes that were only applicable to Winthrop; this distinction is noted below where appropriate. Community Strengths Resilience was mentioned several times as a strength in Chelsea and Revere. Parti cipants in both communities reported that the populations they work with or are a part of are strong willed and have a desire to access services to improve, despite all of the adversity they have faced. One participant in a staff focus group stated, \"Despi te the lack of access to resources, they do their best to try to receive help.\" Key informants and focus group participants stated that patients often advocate for themselves to try to obtain useful resources. In addition, a focus group participant from Re vere stated, \"It is a resilient city that overcomes its obstacles and perseveres.\" In addition, participants mentioned that there is a strong sense of community pride in Chelsea. Thus, it is evident that focus group participants and key informants believe that the people in these communities are key assets. Diverse populations in both Chelsea and Revere . Multiple focus group participants readily and repeatedly talked about the rich diversity of people in Chelsea and Revere and the increase of ethnic and c ultural groups without a lot of racial tension. According to one focus group participant in Chelsea regarding diversity, \"...We are an immigrant city, you get to know about different people and make friends. I belong to a lot of groups.\" Additionally, one fo cus group participant in Chelsea stated, \"I don't feel that, when I walk in Chelsea, people will judge me because of who I am\". Many participants also talked about the wide range of restaurants representing a vast array of cultures in their communities, an advantage that other communities do not have. Participants across focus groups reported a desire to create more cultural events and ways to celebrate the diversity in Chelsea and Revere by uniting all of the different ethnic and racial groups so they are not separated in their own groups. Ultimately, participants really embrace this distinct quality of Chelsea and Revere. Physical location and proximity to Boston is a strength for all three communities. Focus group participants and key informants across multiple populations discussed the benefit of being so close to Boston to access services and care. The physical location of these communities was a highlight for many focus group participants in particular. Participants also highlighted the proximity of s ervices within Chelsea, such as schools, the food pantry at St. Luke's Episcopal Church, and services at MGH Chelsea including the food pantry. The beach is a strength in both Revere and Winthrop. Multiple focus group participants stated that the beach in Winthrop is beautiful, and that the beach in Revere helps to bring the community together. One youth participant stated, \"There are people from other cities that come to the beach; you get to learn about other people's cultures and it exposes us to diff erent things that people in other cities that are predominantly White don't get\". It is apparent that the beach not only aesthetically enhances Revere and Winthrop; it also serves as a common meeting place for people both inside and outside of these commun ities. North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 45 Barriers to Accessing Resources and Services Fear around immigration status and the current political administration has created barriers to utilizing public benefits. Multiple focus group participants and key informants reported that many immig rants are afraid of the current political administration and discussed how this has stopped patients from accessing services such as SNAP benefits because they do not want their participation to affect their status in the country. Participants stated that people are generally afraid of the system and do not feel safe accessing resources; some key informants reported an increase in the number of families who have dropped out of social services due to fear and mistrust. Insurance is a barrier for many patie nts, especially immigrants. A couple of key informants and focus group participants stated that it is difficult for immigrants to access medical and mental health services in Chelsea and Revere. A lot of the care that one receives is based on insurance tha t is unfortunately difficult to obtain. In addition, focus group participants mentioned that insurance payments are too high, especially for people who do not bring in a lot of income. Participants shared that it is difficult to access dental care because insurance is not affordable. Thus, some families do not carry insurance, which limits or hinders the ability to access health care. According to one key informant, children may have insurance but their parents may not. Key informants also mentioned that in surance may not cover all necessary costs and medicine that patients need so they go without care due to lack of finances and coverage. Lastly, participants in all three communities mentioned that some hospitals and clinics may not take certain insurance p lans, creating an obstacle to receiving affordable care. Language barriers between providers and patients makes it difficult to provide care. Many key informants and focus group participants touched on the idea that language barriers play a large role in preventing individuals from accessing services. Several key informant interviews showed that providers who do not speak another language or the language their clients/patients speak find it challenging to work with diverse populations, as this limits the assistance and information they can provide. A few key informants reported that providers often assume a certain level of English and literacy among residents but this is more problematic than helpful. One focus group participant mentioned there was a lack of Spanish interpreters in schools, which creates a barrier for Spanish -speaking parents when trying to communicate with teachers. In addition, key informants highlighted how the inability to speak a client or population's language also negatively affects people's perceptions; one key informant in Chelsea stated, \"If we can't speak your language, that creates some problems\". Lastly, key informants mentioned the need for more ESL classes that are affordable and convenient for community residents; this may h elp build more capacity among residents and begin to alleviate some of the language barriers. Discrimination and lack of cultural sensitivity has led to unfair treatment in Chelsea and Revere. A couple of focus group participants stated they have experie nced discrimination based on language barriers and cultural identity, while other participants talked about receiving unfair treatment because they are in recovery. Elders in Chelsea mentioned that people in the community do not support Hispanics. A couple of participants mentioned that there is a lack of \"immigrant friendly\" people in Chelsea. In addition, a few focus group participants mentioned they felt discriminated against when it comes to housing and landlords in the city. Participants also stated th ey experienced unfair treatment because they speak languages other than English. This finding is particularly striking because cultural diversity is viewed as a strength in these communities, yet unfair treatment based on culture and language is apparent. Key informants talked about the importance of organizations having staff that are culturally competent to work with different ethnic communities, especially among Spanish - speaking populations. Lastly, focus group participants and one key informant reported that some community members in Revere make comments on social media that are hurtful and thus negatively impact the cohesion of the community. North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 46 Social isolation and loneliness is high among elder and Muslim populations. Key informants reported that Musli ms often stay in their own group and are isolated from the larger community; according to one key informant, there is sometimes a perceived \"conflict between how to be a good Muslim and a good American at the same time. Showing cultural competence is impor tant. In the schools' calendar planning during Ramadan, sometimes the schools don't even think about that. In any institution, you should have people from the ethnic communities be part of the planning team.\" In addition, key informants stated that elders choose to be alone; they live alone without company. This may lead to unaddressed health risks and affects how residents work with others to access care. Chelsea could do a better job of messaging to be inclusive and welcoming of its LGBTQ residents. Key informants offered observations and suggestions. \"For example, Chelsea could include and invite LGBTQ people in Get Fit programs and walking campaigns and increase awareness among school guidance counselors about our community. Also, some of our immigrant residents are from countries that have unaccepting attitudes towards LGBT issues, yet their families will have LGBT members who may have difficulties at home because of this. City leaders could talk with us about some scenarios regarding LGBTQ people and h ow to better interact with them. Maybe have occasional discussions on Chelsea Access TV. Also, the religious component of some of the street outreach services can be unwelcoming to LGBT people and there is a huge proportion of people who are LGBTQ who are on the street because of their sexual orientation.\" Housing Rising housing costs and gentrification are a burden on families, especially for people from low -income households. Most focus group participants and key informants across a variety of populat ions in Chelsea and Revere reported that current housing conditions have led to stress for individuals and families. High rental prices and poor housing conditions create a cycle that affects multiple areas of life; for example, one young focus group parti cipant said that if the housing situation was better and people could spend more time at home rather than working to afford their housing, they would be able to spend more time meal prepping, eating healthier foods, and connecting with the community. In ad dition, necessary repairs never seem to be completed; participants mentioned they have broken doors and that landlords do not fix apartments. In addition, participants reported that gentrification is pushing people out, which threatens the closeness of the community as well as the multicultural diversity. One youth focus group participant said, \"They are raising the price, kicking us out, and getting rid of the things we love.\" A key informant who works with parents and young children said, \"Gentrification is happening in Chelsea, so people are moving more. Students are moving out of the district. Otherwise, it's the same population with the same needs but the cost of living is going up, so people are struggling more to make ends meet.\" Participants and key informants reported that a lack of affordable housing has increased the homeless population. Furthermore, the increase in rent and housing costs has led to overcrowded conditions, as people are doubling and tripling up in apartments because they cannot aff ord to live alone or pay for extra rooms. According to participants, upfront costs associated with renting an apartment are too expensive, which is a barrier to accessing affordable housing. Participants also highlighted a disconnect between the income res idents are bringing in and the costs of rent; one participant stated, \"You work harder to have a little extra income but the more money you make, the more you have to pay\"; thus, even working two and three jobs does not provide the opportunity to easily ke ep up with rising housing costs, demonstrating a clear connection between employment and housing affordability. A key informant on the needs of formerly incarcerated people said housing has, by far become the number one issue: \"It used to be jobs but now i t's housing, which helps them keep a job or deal with substance use disorder. Guys would actually rather be in jail than outside on the streets, hustling for a place to stay, and it's getting worse.\" Lastly, elders mentioned the need for more housing that is separate from families with children. Overall, these findings from the focus group and interview data demonstrate how much the lack of affordable, stable housing has negatively impacted these communities; this is especially important because stable hous ing was reported as one of the necessities for creating a healthy community. North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 47 Mental Health Mental health, especially untreated mental illness, is a huge concern for youth and adults. Mental health, notably anxiety and depression, was mentioned in a variety of focus groups as a need that has gone unmet across several populations, including people in recovery or current substance users, youth, elders, and veterans, especially due to trauma. Multiple participants reported that people were dealing with a lot of stress and pressure, but oftentimes mental health is not taken seriously. In addition, multiple focus group participants touched on the influence of race and culture on mental health, stating that some races and cultures do not feel that mental hea lth is an issue that affects them -if people are feeling sad, it is something they should just get over -or that it is something that only affects other people; participants stated there is a mentality that exists that \"Depression is for White people\". Furth ermore, the lack of services to remedy this issue is disheartening; there are not enough resources to adequately address mental health issues, but there is a long waiting list to access services. One focus group participant mentioned that wait times are lo ng for patients to receive care, so much so that people will proclaim they are going to commit suicide to quickly get care; this participant stated, \"No one should have to say 'I'm going to kill myself' in order to get some service\". Across all focus group s and multiple key informant interviews, participants stated that more mental health services were necessary, especially more social workers and mental health counselors in schools. Participants also stated that self -care is important for populations deali ng with stress for a variety of reasons, especially to ensure that people can take care of their families. Regarding formerly incarcerated residents, a key informant suggested that \"Mental Health First Aid should be taught not just to first responders, but to the people themselves, i.e. the former inmates. It should even be taught to the corrections officers because the CO's have a high suicide rate!\" As mental health needs continue to increase among a variety of populations, it is apparent that an increase in mental health services and providers would be highly beneficial. Stigma is a large barrier to accessing services for mental health and treatment for substance use. Focus group participants and key informants in Winthrop reported stereotyping as a pre ssing health concern. One participant stated, \"Once you've been labeled, you can't get away from this label (even if it's wrong)\". In addition, another participant in Winthrop stated, \"We do have a high alcohol use problem that is worse among adults, but i t's hard for people to accept their own problems\". Participants in multiple focus groups highlighted the existence of a \"not in my neighborhood\" or \"not in my backyard\" mentality among community residents, where people will keep their battles with addictio n and substance use to themselves because they do not want others to know about it due to negative perception. Additionally, a few focus group participants talked about the stigma attached to people in recovery, and how this often leads to discrimination a nd unfair treatment when trying to get a job or access education. There is a need for more services for people in recovery; participants suggested creating a Recovery Community Center that provides resources and education to show support for those in recov ery. Participants and key informants reported that stigma poses a barrier for people to access care for mental health services, stating that shame, guilt, and fear prevent those who are using substances from seeking treatment, support, and services; this i n turn \"stops people from living their lives\". Access to Healthy and Affordable Foods There are too many fast food restaurants, and too few opportunities to access healthy, affordable foods. Many focus group participants and key informants touched upon rising obesity rates in Chelsea and Revere, especially because of easy access to fast food restaurants. Participants mentioned people turn to fast food restaurants when they are hungry because the food is cheaper and the portions are larger; this particul arly helps when trying to feed a family that is on a budget or tight with money, highlighting the presence of food insecurity. This finding was present in a wide variety of populations, notably among multicultural populations. One youth participant in Chel sea stated, \"But there is a lot of fast food places. Every corner, you can find a McDonalds and North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 48 Dunkin Donuts\". Another youth participant stated, \"There's like ten Dunkin Donuts in Chelsea for no reason. It's not even two miles long. We only need like two or three in there, but every corner, there's fast food\". Across multiple focus groups, healthy food was deemed more expensive, and participants stressed the importance of providing more access to farmer's markets and organic foods; when participants were a sked what would make a healthy community, all of them mentioned eating healthy foods and vegetables. This finding is especially important because there are limited grocery stores in Chelsea. Similarly, Winthrop focus group participants mentioned the lack o f grocery stores that provide access to healthy foods, as there is only one grocery store in town that is expensive and has a limited variety. In addition to discussing the need to access healthier foods, a couple of focus group participants mentioned that learning healthy eating habits as well, not just eating vegetables and dieting, was important to improve the health of the community. Physical Activity and Recreation There is a need for more activities and opportunities to move around, especially amo ng older youth, in all three communities. While discussing rising obesity rates, multiple focus group participants reported there is a lack of activities and opportunities for people to move around in the community; participants noted there were limited af fordable opportunities to engage in exercise, sports and recreation programs, as well as a lack of walking trails and outdoor bike paths. Youth focus group participants said having more activities in the community would provide a positive outlet for youth to help them avoid turning to alcohol or drugs because they are bored and have nothing to do. One Winthrop focus group participant mentioned there are a lot of parties happening because there is \"Not a lot to do in this town for teenagers; once you hit tee n years it's mainly parties\", and \"There being nothing to do adds to the party culture\". In addition, youth participants and a few key informants stated that creating more activities for the community, especially for youth, would encourage participants to be more active rather than sedentary, and promote more interaction with others in the community, especially to unite young people together. This finding is especially important because youth focus group participants stated they spend between 2 to 8 hours p er day interacting with their cell phones and viewing screens. One youth focus group participant in Revere mentioned that youth are \"Not pushed to be active in the summer\". Focus group participants highlighted the need for more activities for older youth a nd teenagers in particular, as many participants reported there were plenty of opportunities for children. Focus group participants, particularly youth respondents, in Revere and Winthrop stated that a local YMCA would help them stay active. A key informan t from the Muslim community reported that Moroccan youth in Revere who would like to play soccer don't feel welcomed by a soccer league in the city. Focus group participants also mentioned that there are too many hotels in Chelsea, stating that the space c ould be put to greater use in the community. In addition, more green and outdoor spaces would be welcomed in all three of these communities to promote physical activity. Substance Use Substance use remains a pervasive issue in Chelsea, Revere, and Wint hrop and affects multiple areas of residents' lives. Many key informants and focus group participants mentioned the negative impact of substance use across multiple populations. Participants and key informants stated that many people are using substances to self -medicate. Alcohol and heroin were mentioned as substances used by adults in Winthrop. One participant in Winthrop stated, \"We're surrounded by yacht clubs, there's drinking everywhere -we can't do a function without alcohol.\" Marijuana use and vaping , particularly the JUUL, were mentioned as concerns among youth across all three communities. Youth participants mentioned that vaping is prevalent among young people, and this is especially problematic because it can be used in front of teachers in school . One young person in a focus group in Revere mentioned that she saw a student who took a hit from a JUUL in class while the teacher was looking at him; he easily hid the JUUL in his sweatshirt. Another young person in Chelsea stated, \"The other day, I wal ked around and saw a 10 -year -old vaping. You see the middle schoolers vaping before school. It is easy to get them\". According to focus group participants, youth do not perceive the JUUL as harmful or addictive and it seems like everyone is doing it. This low perception of harm also applies to marijuana; one focus group North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 49 participant in Revere stated, \"Since marijuana has been legalized, the youth have been using it more. Sometimes, I have found youth using marijuana treating it like a game, like it's fun...\" P articipants and key informants stated that more services overall are needed to address addiction and substance use in all three communities. Community residents hide issues related to substance use and addiction in Winthrop and Revere. Multiple focus gro up participants and key informants stated that people in the community are often not open about substance use and will keep it a secret from their neighbors. This finding was especially applicable in Winthrop because it is perceived as a small community, w hich participants stated is a double -edged sword because \"Everyone knows everyone's business\". This is also related to the presence of stigma that many participants mentioned in multiple focus groups. Participants mentioned they see needles or know of peop le's family members that have used substances, although people will not admit it because they are ashamed and want to keep the issue to themselves. Similarly, youth in Revere mentioned that people do not want to get help for substance use: \"Instead of gett ing help, they just hide it until it becomes a larger issue, and then it just creates more problems\". Safety Mixed perceptions of safety in Chelsea and Revere. A few focus group participants mentioned that there are areas in Chelsea and Revere that man y people perceive as unsafe, but stated that they do in fact feel safe; a couple of elder focus group participants stated that Chelsea feels a lot safer now than it did before. However, one young focus group participant, a Chelsea resident, mentioned that her car had been broken into three times, causing her to feel unsafe in her neighborhood. In addition, when asked if they feel safe in their community, one participant said no because of racism, community violence such as shootings, and bad traffic; focus group participants were worried about safety after seeing needles in the park and knowing that people are overdosing. One participant in Revere mentioned that is was not safe around Bell Circle due to traffic and the lack of crossing guards. However, in an other resident focus group in Revere, participants stated they feel very safe where they live. A few Spanish speaking focus group participants in Revere mentioned they felt safe while walking down the street and on the bus. Participants also said they want the community to be safer in the future, especially regarding immigrants. Key informants mentioned a change in the perception of Chelsea and Revere being unsafe with high crime rates from the past but it is evident that some of those perceptions still exi st today; while this may be specific to certain areas of Chelsea and Revere, this finding should be explored further. Transportation Transportation was mentioned as both a strength and a challenge to accessing health and social services. Although Chel sea focus group participants noted that access to transportation, especially the 111 bus and the Silver Line, was a strength in Chelsea, participants also stated that transportation was a burden because buses are crowded and do not run frequently enough. W inthrop focus group participants mentioned there is a lack of public transportation, with only one bus running through Winthrop infrequently, making it difficult to access health services. One focus group participant in Winthrop talked about the lack of me dical services in town, and the need to travel into Boston to get care, especially specialized care, which means \"Parking, money, traffic, time, and people don't have it.\" Elders also mentioned that the MBTA RIDE needs to improve since many people rely on it to access services but people end up waiting for it for a long time. In addition, the roads were mentioned as an obstacle to getting around Chelsea and commuting to Boston. Many participants in Revere reported satisfaction with transportation in the cit y; participants mentioned that there is plenty of access to transportation with the blue line and several buses that run frequently. In addition, participants stated that the MGH Shuttle in Revere is more helpful for getting to appointments than the T. Thu s, the availability of transportation in most of the communities is appreciated, but the logistics and execution of the various modes of transportation are not always helpful to community residents. North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 50 Environment The streets in Chelsea and Revere need to be cleaned up. Participants stated there was too much trash in Chelsea; they mentioned they see people throw trash on the streets and feel that Broadway is really dirty. One participant stated, \"You do not feel good about where you live if there's trash everywhere\". Participants in Revere also mentioned that they often see dog mess on the streets. In addition, there are large rats in Revere and Chelsea. One participant stated, \"If you're a normal sized rat, that's okay but when you're as big as my face, that's an issue\". In addition, one young participant mentioned that she has seen needles on the ground while commuting to school with her mom. When asked what would make a healthy community, a clean environment with clean air and water without trash on the ground was mentioned in several focus groups. The importance of maintaining a clean environment without trash on the ground was prevalent throughout multiple focus groups. The condition of the environment has made a large, negative impact on health, esp ecially in Chelsea and Winthrop. Participants mentioned traffic, air pollution and noise from the airport, and coastal flooding as environmental issues, especially in Winthrop. Because of the airport, insomnia is an issue for residents. In addition, partic ipants mentioned other diseases and conditions that affect the community, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and cancer. Focus group participants and key informants stated they have noticed higher rates of breast cancer. In addition, residents have dea lt with COPD, respiratory diseases, and asthma due to obesity, as well as poor environmental and industrial conditions; these concerns were mentioned in all three communities. One focus group participant in Winthrop stated, \"We've buried a lot of people in their 40s and 50s that wasn't related to substance use\", referring to the number of deaths in Winthrop because of environmental cancers and diseases. Implications for Moving Forward Need for stronger collaboration and cohesion among services and organ izations. While multiple focus group participants commented on the strength of community organizations and stakeholders coming together, especially in Chelsea, participants also stated that it would be in everyone's best interest to strengthen cohesion amo ng these stakeholders. Key informants talked about the importance of capitalizing on individuals who are invested and care about these communities to help improve them; working together was mentioned as an important factor in creating a healthy community. Many key informants talked about the importance of increasing communication and sharing more information with providers and networks to better connect services so that everyone is on the same page. One key informant said there a lot of organizations in Che lsea already working on improving the city but she was not sure how well they are working together: \"If we're all taking care of the community together, we should all have communication between each other\". A few key informants mentioned that there are man y service providers in the community, especially Chelsea, that are all helpful but it would be better for everyone to work together to fully treat community residents. Multiple participants across Chelsea, Revere, and Winthrop, mentioned that it is imperat ive to come together to find common ground and work in the best interests of the community to create a more comprehensive system for holistic care, which would help improve the lack of communication among providers. A couple of focus group participants men tioned that more leadership accountability and buy -in, and leaders who educate themselves on issues in the community, would be advantageous. Lastly, several focus group participants mentioned the need for more community engagement and participation among r esidents of all ages to better unite and enhance these communities. Resistance to change has hindered progress in Winthrop. Several focus group participants stated that people seem to be stuck in their ways and do not readily accept change. Participants also mentioned that people are complacent in Winthrop and resist new people or new things. It is evident that participants hope Winthrop will overcome division and come together to resolve issues to improve the community. North Suffolk 2019 Integrated Community Health Needs Assessment 51 Need to be more proactive than r eactive in Winthrop. Focus group participants mentioned that the community is very supportive when something tragic happens, such as an illness or tragedy, but when it comes to making change ahead of time, this usually does not happen. Oftentimes, resident s react to issues as they come up but participants feel it would be beneficial to have a more proactive role. One participant stated, \"It's a pretty responsive community in general; people try to stay in tune with what's going on in town. They care deeply about what happens in the town, but it's also a negative because we're not as proactive -it's a double -edged sword. It would be nice to be a little more proactive\". Additional Implications All focus groups and key informant interviews touched upon the n eed for money and consistent, sustainable funding streams to make lasting change, continue vital programming, and expand services for community residents. Winthrop focus group participants in particular stated that new industry and updated infrastructure within the community would help bring in revenue and improve finances to address community needs that are often not viewed the same as surrounding communities such as Chelsea and Revere. In addition, multiple participants across all three communities advoca ted for more resources and funding for schools, a crucial step towards making important improvements in these communities. All in all, sustainable, dependable funding is required to expand services and create imperative changes in Chelsea, Revere, and Wint hrop.

Although Chelsea focus group participants noted that access to transportation, especially the 111 bus and the Silver Line, was a strength, they also stated that transportation was a burden due to crowded buses and infrequent schedules. Winthrop focus group participants mentioned there is a lack of public transportation, with only one bus running through Winthrop infrequently, making it difficult to access health services. One focus group participant discussed the lack of medical services in town, and the need to travel into Boston to get care, especially specialized care, which means \"Parking, money, traffic, time, and people don't have it.\" Elders also mentioned that the MBTA RIDE needs to improve since many people rely on it to access services but people end up waiting for it for a long time.

Youth focus group participants said having more activities in the community would provide a positive outlet for youth to help them avoid turning to alcohol or drugs because they are bored and have nothing to do. Youth participants and a few key informants stated that creating more activities for the community, especially for youth, would encourage participants to be more active rather than sedentary, and promote more interaction with others in the community, especially to unite young people together. Focus group participants highlighted the need for more activities for older youth and teenagers in particular, as many participants reported there were plenty of opportunities for children. Focus group participants, particularly youth respondents, in Revere and Winthrop stated that a local YMCA would help them stay active.

Participants shared that it is difficult to access dental care because insurance is not affordable. Key informants also mentioned that insurance may not cover all necessary costs and medicine that patients need so they go without care due to lack of finances and coverage. Lastly, participants in all three communities mentioned that some hospitals and clinics may not take certain insurance plans, creating an obstacle to receiving affordable care.Combined Chelsea Revere Winthrop Overall cost 24%Overall cost 30%Wait time too long 27%Location of health care 29% Wait time too long 23%Wait time too long 25%Overall 25%Inconvenient hours 19% Insurance 19%Insurance Location health care 17%Inconvenient hours 18%Location of health care 14%Wait time too long 17% Inconvenient hours 17%No doctors available 11%Inconvenient hours 14%Insurance 15%Top 5 Barriers to Getting Non -Emergency Medical Care in Survey Respondents Community Language barriers between providers and patients makes it difficult to provide care.

In addition, key informants stated that elders choose to be alone; they live alone without company. This may lead to unaddressed health risks and affects how residents work with others to access care.Chelsea Revere Winthrop MA MS HS MS HS Combined MS & HS MS HS Seriously considered suicide 20% 13% and High School Students Reporting Suicide Ideation Black boxes=did not ask on survey Winthrop reported a combined Middle and High school percentage.

One focus group participant mentioned that wait times are long for patients to receive care, so much so that people will proclaim they are going to commit suicide to quickly get care. Across all focus groups and multiple key informant interviews, participants stated that more mental health services were necessary , especially more social workers and mental health counselors in schools. \"No one should have to say 'I'm going to kill myself' in order to get some service\". - Focus group participant Foreign -Born % (N)Non Foreign -Born % (N) Chelsea 13% 19% (53) Winthrop 22% (6) 14% (45)Survey Respondents who Rated Their Mental Health 'Poor or Fair' by Foreign- born Status 45% 34%38% 30% Chelsea Revere Winthrop MAPercent of Survey Respondents who Rated Their Mental Health Fair', Data source: North Suffolk Community Health Needs Assessment community survey Data source: North Suffolk Community Health Needs Assessment community surveyNote: Breaking down foreign -born status by community makes a smaller sample size for each community.

Focus group participants and key informants across multiple populations discussed the benefit of being so close to Boston to access services and care. The physical location of these communities was a highlight for many focus group participants in particular. Resilience was mentioned several times as a strength in Chelsea and Revere. Participants in both communities reported that the populations they work with or are a part of are strong willed and have a desire to access services to improve, despite all of the adversity they have faced. \"It is a resilient city that overcomes its obstacles and perseveres.\" Revere focus group participant \"...We are an immigrant city, you get to know about different people and make friends. I belong to a lot of groups.\" Chelsea focus group participant \"I don't feel that, when I walk in Chelsea, people will judge me because of who I am\". Chelsea focus group participant The beach is a strength in both Revere and Winthrop. Multiple focus group participants stated that the beach in Winthrop is beautiful, and that the beach in Revere helps to bring the community together. One youth participant stated, \"There are people from other cities that come to the beach; you get to learn about other people's cultures and it exposes us to different things that people in o ther cities that are predominantly White don't get\".

Multiple focus group participants and key informants stated that people in the community are often not open about substance use and will keep it a secret from their neighbors. This is also related to the presence of stigma that many participants mentioned in multiple focus groups. Participants mentioned they see needles or know of people's family members that have used substances, although people will not admit it because they are ashamed and want to keep the issue to themselves. Similarly, youth in Revere mentioned that people do not want to get help for substance use: \"Instead of getting help, they just hide it until it becomes a larger issue, and then it just creates more problems\".

One young person in a focus group in Revere mentioned that she saw a student who took a hit from a JUUL in class while the teacher was looking at him; he easily hid the JUUL in his sweatshirt. According to focus group participants, youth do not perceive the JUUL as harmful or addictive and it seems like everyone is doing it.47.2116.7 59.0171.7 108.8* 87.2 29105 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Chelsea WinthropRevere MA *Number suppressed due to confidentiality for Winthrop for years 2007, 2008, and 2010 Data Source : Massachusetts Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA)Heroin Overdose Hospitalization Age -Adjusted Rate 270.7 262.1269.7 238.7237.1 229 233 2014Winthrop MAChelsea RevereNon -Opioid Overdose Hospitalization Age -Adjusted Rate per 100,000, 2007- 2014 Data Source : Massachusetts Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA) 8%26% 8%21%20% 4%31% Chelsea MSChelsea HSRevere MS Revere HS Winthrop MS & HSMA MS MA HSPercent of Middle and High School Students Reporting Drinking Alcohol in Past 30 Days Winthrop reported a combined Middle and High school percentage.

The iCHNA ProcessA CHNA is an organized process led b y community partners from healthcare, community-based organizations, social services, residents, and city leaders. These partners work together to identify the top strengths, challenges, and public health needs of a community . Factors that affect both individual and a specific group' s health and well- being were an important part of the iCHNA process. These factors, called the social determinants of health , are things lik e education, income, and housing. They are the conditions into which we are born and r aised, live and work. childhood e xperienceseducationhousing community healthcar e emplo yment income 1,819 Quality of Life Surveys CollectedThe community partners that formed the North Suffolk Integr ated Community Health Needs Assessment (iCHNA) collected and reviewed information from residents, lik e you, and experts living and working in Chelsea, Revere, and Winthrop. For more information, go to our website: Northsuffolkassessment.org Public Health Data22 Focus Groups29 Key Interviews The information gathered during the CHNA is used to create an action plan, called a Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP). The CHIP explains how community partners and residents can work together to improve the health and well-being for everyone . Over 2,000 people helped to collect and analyze the data.

We chose the top 3 health priorities where we think we can improve in three years b y working together. Behavior al Health Housing The cost, or affordability , and quality of housing affects where you are able to live, your finances, ph ysical and mental health and quality of life . Mental health, for youth and adults, has been a top health concern for residents for man y years. Mental health is not alwa ys seen as an important part of over all health in some cultures. This mak es it harder for those who need support to get help. Man y people with mental health issues also live with substance abuse disorder (SUD). F or this reason, we included SUDs in the Behavior al Health category . Economic Mobility & Stability Regional Strengths More residents are becoming 'cost burdened,' meaning they spend more than 30-50% of their monthly income on housing because of regionallly high housing costs. Built EnvironmentChronic DiseaseEnvironmental Concerns Housing Employment & Income Education Food Insecurity/ Healthy EatingSocial Connectedness Mental Health Substance Use DisordersVaping & E- cigarettesViolence & Trauma Your job, income, and how much money you can save are three factors that shape your quality of life and health. In the North Suffolk region, man y struggle just to mak e ends meet. Compared to Massachusetts, residents in Chelsea, Revere and Winthrop have a lower median household income. Now , we are working with experts from the North Suffolk region to create the Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP). This plan will be our a 3-year road map to work on the concerns r aised above and more. Stay involved in our progress! Continue to check our website Northsuffolkassessment.org for updates.
