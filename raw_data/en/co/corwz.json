The North Dakota Department of Health (NDDoH) sought to engage and train youth in areas with high vaccine hesitancy to be public health advocates. Methods: The NDDoH launched the Health Equity Ambassador Program (HEAP) in November 2021 to recruit youth as public health ambassadors. The NDDoH contacted potential partners from colleges in areas with low vaccination rates; Minot State University (MSU) and United Tribes Technical College (UTTC) accepted the invitation to participate in HEAP. Each institution has a faculty member who receives optional compensation to recruit and supervise student ambassadors. Ambassadors are paid 10 hours/week to build their public health knowledge to plan and implement at least two pre-approved events in their community. NDDoH staff train and guide ambassadors on health equity through an orientation and quarterly check-ins. Results: While putting on events, the ambassadors leverage their social capital on campus and in the community. In early 2022, the four MSU ambassadors recruited 49 individuals who were vaccinated via a COVID-19 vaccination clinic, conducted COVID-19 screenings, and provided at-home testing kits. The UTTC ambassador distributed COVID-19 at-home testing kits and COVID-19 care kits with sanitizing supplies. Conclusions: The HEAP program has strengthened connections between the NDDoH and higher education while empowering students and promoting health equity. Furthermore, HEAP fosters a public health-informed workforce. HEAP will onboard more colleges/universities and plans to expand to high school students. "}
