The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized a booster dose for the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is recommending booster shots for all adults over age 16. Health experts are encouraging all those eligible to consider getting the booster shot. [here](https://www.mountsinai.org/about/covid19/vaccine-information)to read more about what you need to know. \"The most important thing is to get vaccinated, and get a booster shot\" if you over 16, says [Waleed Javaid, MD](https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/waleed-javaid?utm_medium=paymybill&utm_source=mountsinaiorg&utm_campaign=msorghp), Professor of Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and an expert on infectious diseases. \"We at Mount Sinai are closely monitoring reports on various variants including Omicron and Delta. At this time, we encourage everyone to get vaccines and boosters, and continue to wear masks in public and follow guidance provided by the public health officials.\" [strengthened its recommendation](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1208-16-17-booster.html)on booster shots to include everyone 16 or older when they are eligible. The CDC is working to learn more about the new Omicron variant. The CDC continues to recommend wearing a mask in public indoor settings in areas where there are high rates of COVID-19, and getting vaccinated and booster shots for those who are eligible. [Read more from the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html) In this Q&A, Dr. Javaid answers other frequently asked questions about COVID-19 booster shots. When should I get a booster shot? If you were fully vaccinated with the Pfizer or the Moderna vaccine, you should get the booster at least six months after getting the two vaccine doses. If you received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, you should get the booster at least two months after completing the primary vaccination. What do we know about side effects from the booster shot? I received my booster, and I had pretty much the same reaction as my second dose. Most of those around me also experienced very similar reactions as their second dose. The short-term side effects include pain in the arm where you got your shot, tiredness, and headache. There is nothing in the literature or in our experience at Mount Sinai to suggest the reaction will be any different from the first and second doses. Does it matter which booster shot I get? The most recent recommendation from the FDA and the CDC is that we can use these vaccines interchangeably, and they have not found one is better than the other. Right now, they are considered equal. What if I got the J&J vaccine? People who have received a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine can get a booster using the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, or they can get a Pfizer or Moderna dose as a booster. However, as of Thursday, December 16, the [CDC recommends that patients receive an mRNA COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1216-covid-19-vaccines.html) vaccine over Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine due to the increased effectiveness of mRNA vaccines. What is the difference between a booster shot and a third dose? A third shot is considered part of the original series and is considered necessary to provide full protection to a group of people who have reduced ability to fight infections, which includes patients being treated for some cancers or those with an organ transplant. Boosters are shots that have now been authorized for all adults after a certain time period has passed since they were fully vaccinated in order to boost their immune system to ensure they can continue to fight the infection. Right now, a booster shot is not required to be considered fully vaccinated if you are not among the special group specifically recommended for a third shot. I've had COVID-19 and two doses of the vaccine, should I get the booster shot? People who have had COVID-19 and got two doses of vaccine can certainly get their booster shot. There seem to be questions about this. The data shared by the CDC and other agencies is that getting the booster shot after being infected with COVID-19 offers you additional protection against infection. To all adults, I would say, definitely consider a booster as an option to protect yourself and your loved ones around you. I encourage everybody to reach out to their providers or to Mount Sinai for any advice we can provide. "}
