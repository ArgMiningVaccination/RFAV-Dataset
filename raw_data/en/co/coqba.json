Recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) has a considerable impact on quality of life and impairment of daily function. Role of antibiotics to prevent RARS in children with nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) has not been investigated. What does this article add to our knowledge? Azithromycin prophylaxis can reduce the number of rhinosinusitis epi- sodes and medication score, and improve nasal symptoms in NAR children with RARS. The number needed to treat using azithromycin prophylaxis to prevent 1 patient from having RARS was 2. How does this study impact current management guidelines? These data support the ef cacy of azithromycin pro- phylaxis to prevent RARS in children with NAR. BACKGROUND: Recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) is characterized by multiple episodes of acute rhinosinusitis between which symptoms and signs resolve completely. The role of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent RARS in children withnonallergic rhinitis (NAR) has not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of azithromycin to prevent RARS in children with NAR.METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in NAR (5-15 years) with RARS. Azithromycin (5 mg/kg/d) 3 d/wk for 12 months or placebo wasassigned to the study group and the control group, respectively.Patients with allergic rhinitis were excluded. Number of rhino- sinusitis episodes in 12 months, visual analog scale score of nasal symptoms, and adjunctive medication score were recorded.RESULTS: Forty patients were enrolled and 20 patients were assigned randomly to the azithromycin and placebo groups. IgG subclass and speci c antibody de ciencies were found in 83%and 2.5% of patients, respectively. After 12 months, the number of rhinosinusitis episodes/y in the azithromycin group reduced signicantly from 5 to 0.5 ( P<.001) in contrast to the placebo group. Number needed to treat using azithromycin prophylaxisto prevent 1 patient from having RARS was 2. The average visual analog scale score and the average adjunctive medication score in the azithromycin (but not in the placebo) group reducedsignicantly compared with baseline (2.2 -1.4 vs 5.4 -1.8) and medication score, andimprove nasal symptoms in NAR children with RARS. /C2112017 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Pediatric rhinosinusitis is a common medical problem. In children, it is estimated that 5% to 10% of upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) are complicated by acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) and that 6% to 13% of all children develop rhinosinusitisby the age of 3 years. 1Early recognition and adequate manage- ment are the main strategies to improve outcome. Pediatric rhinosinusitis is categorized as acute, subacute, or chronic. ARS lasts 10 to 30 days, subacute rhinosinusitis lasts 4 to 12 weeks,and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) lasts more than 12 weeks. 2 Recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) is characterized by mul-tiple episodes of ARS where the symptoms and signs of infectionresolve completely between episodes. 3,4RARS and CRS have been found in 11.5% and 18.9% of cases of pediatric rhinosi- nusitis, respectively.5Children with CRS or RARS need a pro- longed course of antibiotics and frequent health care utilization.These conditions have a considerable impact on quality of life and impairment of daily function. 6-8aFaculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand bFaculty of Medicine, Department of Pharmacy and Siriraj Health Policy Unit, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand cFaculty of Medicine, Department of Oto-rhino-laryngology, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand This work was supported by a Siriraj Grant for Research Development from the Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.

E-mail: orathai.pib@mahidol.ac.th or jirapongo@yahoo.com . Immunology used AMS- tract infection VAS- visual analog scale RARS and CRS are uncommon conditions in healthy children. Hence, children should be evaluated for underlying diseases such as allergic rhinitis (AR) and nonallergic rhinitis (NAR), immu-nodeciency, ciliary dysfunction, gastroesophageal re flux, and anatomical abnormalities of the osteomeatal complex (including septal deviation, nasal polyps, and concha bullosa). 5,9-11Several strategies have dura- tion of antibiotics; saline irrigation; centers; vaccines againstinfluenza and Haemophilus in fluenzae type b; removal of adenoids; and treatment of underlying factors (eg, AR, gastroesophageal reflux, and anatomical obstruction). 11-14A prolonged course of antibiotics in CRS has been associated with bene cial outcome in several reports.15,16 A prospective randomized controlled trial to determine the efcacy of prophylactic antibiotics for RARS in children is lacking. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of azithromycin to prevent RARS in children with NAR. Patients with AR were excluded because the most speci c ther- apy for moderate-to-severe AR is allergen immunotherapy. METHODS Study This 12-month double-blind, pla- cebo-controlled study ( Figure 1 ). The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Siriraj Hospital (Mahidol University,Bangkok, Thailand; approval code: 394/2551(EC4)). Written informed consent was obtained from the parents/guardians of each child. Participants Children aged 5 to 15 years diagnosed as having RARS in pedi- atric allergy clinic and otorhinolaryngology clinic at Siriraj Hospital were recruited. The number of rhinosinusitis episodes was deter- mined from medical records. ARS was de ned as persistent symp- toms of a URI lasting more than 10 days but less than 30 days, or worsening symptoms of a URI after initial improvement, or severe symptoms at onset (purulent nasal discharge for 3-4 days with highfever). 3,4,17RARS was de ned as 3 episodes of ARS in 6 months or 4 episodes in 12 months, each lasting less than 30 days and separated by intervals of 10 days or more during which the patient was asymptomatic.3,4Patients who had CRS (symptoms of rhinosinusitis lasting more than 90 days and asymptomatic less than 10 days be- tween episodes of rhinosinusitis),3,4AR, a history of allergic re- actions to azithromycin or macrolides, or underlying diseases (eg,chronic renal diseases, liver diseases, or cardiovascular diseases) were excluded from this study, as were patients who received other pre- ventive therapy (eg, nasal irrigation with gentamicin or sus- pension (5 mg/kg body weight/d; Zithromax; P zer, New York, NY) on 3 nonconsecutive days per week (eg, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for 12 months. A placebo was prepared by a pharmacist (T.T.), and was identical to the oral suspension of azithromycin inappearance, texture, smell, taste, labeling, and packaging. Before administration, the oral powder of the trial medication was recon- stituted with 9 mL of water in a bottle to give a total volume of 15mL per bottle. The viscosity of the placebo was identical to that of azithromycin after reconstitution. A 12-month period was designed to overcome the seasonal variation of URI. Patients were asked toreturn the bottle at each visit to ensure compliance. All patients were instructed to use normal saline nasal irrigation. They were allowed to use adjunctive medications for relief of rhinitis symptoms if needed (eg, intranasal corticosteroids, oral antihista-mines, oral leukotriene receptor antagonists, and oral decongestants). Patients and their parents were instructed to keep a diary during the study period, for a daily evaluation of nasal symptoms and adjunctivemedications. During the study period, all patients were instructed to come to the pediatric allergy clinic or pediatric outpatient clinic for any illnessand they were evaluated by J.V. The patients who had ARS, de ned by the American Academy of Pediatrics criteria, 3,4were documented and treated with antibiotic therapy (excluded azithromycin) for 10 to14 days. The azithromycin prophylaxis was stopped during thatperiod and restarted after the treatment of ARS. Randomization Block-of-four randomization was used for allocation sequencing of patients using numbered containers. T.T. and O.J. generated the allocation sequence and assigned patients to their groups. J.V. enrolled patients and assessed outcomes. J.V. and patients wereblinded to group assignment from the beginning of assignment to the end of interventions. Interventions were decoded at the end of the study by O.J. Procedures In the run-in period, all children were evaluated for allergic sensitization and immune function. Serum IgG, IgA, IgM as well as IgG subclass and antibody responses to pneumococcal immuniza-tion were assessed. The skin prick test was done with a panel of the most prevalent local aeroallergens: house dust mites ( Dermatopha- and dogs; grass pollens (Bermuda, Overview study ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT MONTH 20172 (10 mg/mL) and physiologic (0.9%) saline were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. A positive skin prick test result was de ned as a wheal diameter of 3 mm or more to at least 1 of these aero-allergens. Patients who had a negative skin prick test result to all aeroallergens were recruited. Serum levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, as well as IgG subclasses were measured by nephelometry using reagentsand an automated system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). De - ciency of IgG subclasses was de ned using low-level criteria ( <2 SDs of normal levels for age) low-percentage ( <60%, <20%,<5%, and 23F) were measured in serum samples obtained before and 4 to 6 weeks after immunization usingan ELISA. Adequate response to individual pneumococcal serotype was de ned as a postimmunization antibody concentration of 1.3 mg/mL or higher, or a 4-fold increase over the preimmunization value. Speci c antibody de ciency was de ned as a satisfactory response to less than 50% of the serotypes tested in children be- tween 2 and 5 years, and less than 70% of the serotypes tested inchildren older than 5 years. 19,20 Primary and secondary outcomes The primary outcome was the number of episodes of rhinosi- nusitis in 12 months. Secondary outcomes were the visual analog scale (VAS) score and adjunctive medication score (AMS). The daily VAS score was used to assess nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasalcongestion, sneezing, nasal pruritus, snoring, and postnasal drip),which were graded every day by patients in a diary using an 11-point rating scale (0 \u00bcno symptoms to 10 \u00bcsevere symptoms) for all combined nasal symptoms. 21,22The average VAS score was the average of the daily VAS score during the period of observation. The daily AMS for each patient was calculated as the sum of adjunctive medication administered on a particular day. Scores were assigned todifferent medications: 0 \u00bcno rescue medication was taken; 1 \u00bc patient took oral antihistamines; 2 \u00bcpatient took oral leukotriene receptor antagonists 3 \u00bcpatient took intra- nasal corticosteroids. 23,24The average AMS was the average of the daily AMS during the period of observation. Adverse events Adverse events were documented throughout the study by asking the parents/guardians of the children at each assessment about events associated with administration of the study medication. Statistical analyses Calculation of sample size was based on a preliminary study, which showed that the number of rhinosinusitis episodes was0.6/C60.3 per month per patient with recurrent rhinosinusitis. After using azithromycin prophylaxis, it was presumed that effective treatment would reduce the number of rhinosinusitis episodes by50%. Using 80% power, an alpha value of 0.05, and a beta value of0.2, the sample size for each group was estimated to be 17 patients. Allowing for a prevalence of withdrawal of approximately 20%, 20 patients were recruited in each group. Baseline characteristics of patients in the active and placebo groups were analyzed using descriptive statistics (frequency, mean, median, SD, and range), the chi-square test, and the Mann-WhitneyUtest. Comparison between the number of rhinosinusitis episodes per year in the active and placebo groups was done using the Mann- Whitney Utest and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Between-group differences in the average VAS score and the average AMS werecalculated using the independent-sample ttest. Within-group dif- ferences in the average VAS score and the average AMS were calculated using the paired-sample ttest. The number needed to treat was also calculated. A Pvalue of less than .05 was considered signicant. RESULTS Participants The study was conducted between January 2010 and June 2015. One hundred children with RARS were screened; 59 werenot eligible, and 1 declined to participate ( Figure 2 ). Hence, 40 patients were enrolled into the study. Twenty patients were assigned randomly to azithromycin and placebo groups, respec-tively. All patients were reported to receive an in fluenza vaccine every year. No patient had an infection other than sinusitis (eg, pneumonia, bronchiectasis, or otitis media). The 2 groups were homogeneous with respect to baseline demographic data, including age, sex, number of rhinosinusitis episodes, and immune function ( Table I ). Thirty-three patients (83%) had an underlying IgG subclass de ciency, and 1 patient (2.5%) had an underlying speci c antibody de ciency. The baseline average VAS score in the azithromycin group was signicantly higher than that in the placebo group ( P\u00bc.02), whereas the baseline average AMS in the azithromycin group was not signi cantly different from that in the placebo group (P\u00bc.07). At follow-up, 40 patients (20 in each group) completed the study ( Figure 2 ). Number of rhinosinusitis episodes The number of rhinosinusitis episodes per year in the azi- thromycin and placebo groups at baseline and after study completion is shown in Figure 3 . The number of rhinosinusitis episodes per year in the azithromycin group was reduced signicantly after 12 months of intervention (median, 0.5; range, 0-6.0) compared with baseline (median, number of rhinosinusitis episodes per year in the placebo group was not reduced signi cantly (median at baseline, 4.0, and range, 4.0-6.0; median at trial completion, 4.0, and 0-6.0) (difference, 0.0; 95% CI, /C02.0 to 0.0; P\u00bc.09). The in number from the baseline value was signi cantly different in the azithromycin group compared with the placebo group(P<.001). The number needed to treat using azithromycin to prevent 1 patient suffering from RARS was 2. Patients who had a reduction in the number of sinusitis epi- sodes of more than 50% were designated as \"responders. \"Re- sponders were found in 85% (17 of 20) of the azithromycin group and 25% (5 of 20) of the placebo group (difference,60.0%; 95% CI, 29.7%-76.9%; P<.001). In the azithromycin group, 15 of 17 (88%) responders had an underlying immu- nodeciency. Age, sex, or immunode ciency status were not predictors of a favorable response to azithromycin ( P>.05). In addition, the number of antibiotic courses given during the study period in the azithromycin group was signi cantly less than that in the placebo group (median, 0.5, and range, 0-6.0, vsmedian, 4.0, and range, 0-6.0; P<.001). VAS score and AMS The average VAS score in the azithromycin group was reduced signicantly after 12 months of intervention (2.2 /C61.4) compared with baseline (5.4 /C61.8) (mean difference, /C03.2/C62.6;J ALLERGY IMMUNOL P<.001). The average AMS in the azi- thromycin group was also reduced signi cantly after 12 months of intervention (3.9 /C61.7) compared with baseline (5.4 /C61.1) (mean difference, /C01.5/C61.4; 95% CI, /C02.2 to/C00.9; P<.001). The average VAS score in the placebo group was not reduced signi - cantly after 12 months of intervention (4.6 /C61.3) compared with baseline (4.0 /C61.8) (mean difference, 0.6 /C62.0; 95% CI, /C00.3 to 1.6; P\u00bc.16). The average AMS in the placebo group was notreduced signi cantly after 12 months of intervention (4.5 /C61.0) compared with baseline (4.7 /C61.2) (mean difference, /C00.2/C60.5; 95% CI, /C00.5 to 0.4; P\u00bc.09). The reduction from baseline in the average VAS score and the average AMS was signi cant in the azithromycin group (mean difference, /C03.8/C60.7; 95% CI, /C05.3 to/C02.3; P<.001) compared with the 95% CI, /C02.0 to /C00.6; P\u00bc.001, respectively) ( Table II ).

Adverse events (allergic reactions, diarrhea, nausea, vomit- ing, abdominal pain, dizziness, headache, cardiovascular events,oral candidiasis, or serious infections) were not reported in either group. DISCUSSION Antibiotic prophylaxis has been studied for its potential bene t in several conditions (eg, bronchiectasis, otitis media, and diseases. 16,25-28Ragab et al15compared erythromycin with surgery in 90 patients with CRS and found that both treatments elicited similar improve-ments in symptom scores and endoscopic ndings at follow-up. They suggested that CRS should be treated initially with aggres- sive medical treatment before a decision is made regarding surgical intervention. Wallwork et al 16conducted a trial of roxithromycin (150 mg/d) versus placebo for 3 months in 64 patients with CRS and demonstrated that patients in the antibiotic group (but not those in the placebo group) had a signi cant improvement in sinonasal outcome and nasal endoscopy. In contrast, Videler et al29designated patients with recalcitrant CRS with or without nasal polyps unresponsive to optimal medical treatment andsurgical therapy to receive either azithromycin or placebo.Azithromycin was given at 500 mg for 3 days during the rst week, followed by 500 mg per week for the next 11 weeks. Fifty-eight percent of the patients had undergone revision sinus surgery and 52% had a nasal polyp. No signi cant bene t was found in the treatment group compared with the placebo group. Authorsstated that treatment failure could have been due to disease severity or underdosing of azithromycin. 29In addition, nasal polyposis and computed tomography suggested apoor response to macrolide therapy. 25 Gandhi et al30studied the effect of amoxicillin (20 mg/kg/d) for 1 year as prophylaxis in 26 children with CRS and showed a50% reduction in the number of episodes of sinusitis in 74% of subjects. There were no signi cant differences in age, sex, atopy, or presence of a B-cell immune \"poor 94 children with RARS and showed that 69% of children received preventive therapy, of whom 61.5% received oral antibiotic prophylaxis, 33.8% underwent received intravenous immunoglobulin. All patients who receivedimmunotherapy had been diagnosed with AR. Up to 13.8% of children with RARS had a spontaneous remission. The present study demonstrated that azithromycin prophy- laxis can signi cantly reduce the incidence of rhinosinusitis and FIGURE 3.

Azithromycin was chosen because of its anti-in flammatory and immunomodulatory activity.32,33The selected dose was based on the recommended antibiotic pro-phylaxis for primary antibody de ciencies. 25With a number needed to treat of 2, this regimen of antibiotic prophylaxis seems to be an attractive choice for NAR children with RARS. Underlying conditions for CRS and RARS have been inves- tigated in several studies. Shapiro et al34studied 61 children with CRS referred to an allergist for allergy and immunology workup.They found that 36% of subjects had a positive skin test result to inhalant allergen and 56% had low IgG or a poor antibody response to a polysaccharide vaccine or both. 34Gandhi et al30 evaluated 86 children with CRS. They found that 29% of pa-tients had a a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Eleven of 17 patients who were hypo-responsive to the pneumococcal polysaccharide most common predisposing factor for RARS in children was a de ciency in an IgG subclass (78.7%), followed by NAR (64.9%) and AR (35.1%). In the present study, most patients had a de ciency in an IgG subclass that did not justify monthly use of intravenous immu-noglobulin. The practice parameter for the diagnosis and man- agement of primary immunode ciency suggests that milder antibody ciencies (eg, selective ciency of IgA, de ciency of an IgG subclass, de ciency of a speci c antibody, or transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy) can be treated with anti- biotic prophylaxis. 35However, our study did not have the power tond the predictor of response to prophylaxis using azi- thromycin because it was not designed for this purpose. A major concern with the use of antibiotic prophylaxis is the development of antimicrobial resistance among the microbiota. Long-term macrolides were widely used in cystic brosis (CF) or non-CF bronchiectasis based on improving pulmonary functionand reducing exacerbation. 25In the past decade, the increasing evidences of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in patients with bron- chiectasis on prophylactic antibiotic were reported. A study in pediatric patients with CF showed that long-term azithromycinin these patients signi cantly increased macrolide-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in almost all carriers. 36In a study by Hansen et al,37long-term, low-dose azithromycin in patients with CF showed signi of S Haemophilus in resistance in S aureus only.37In a recent multicenter trial, children with bronchiectasis were randomized to weekly azithromycin or placebo for 24 months.38Nasopha- ryngeal carriage of Hi n fluenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis decreased signi cantly in the azithromycin group compared with the placebo group, whereas macrolide-resistant S pneumonia e and S aureus carriage increased signi cantly. Interestingly, children with high adherence in the azithromycin group were associatedwith lower carriage of any pathogen and fewer macrolide- resistant pathogens. In the follow-up swab (median 6 months after the treatment), macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae declined signicantly in the azithromycin group, but S aureus remained 100% macrolide resistant. This study provided important in- formation that the adherence to prophylactic macrolide maylimit macrolide resistance by decreasing carriage. The reductionin macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae after the cessation ofprophylactic antibiotic was reassuring that macrolide resistance was transient. Our study showed that a 12-month course of azithromycin prophylaxis was effective in preventing RARS in children with NAR. After that, we suggested to discontinueazithromycin and monitor the clinical of RARS in these patients to prevent macrolide resistance. In conclusion, prophylaxis using azithromycin was bene cial reducing the number of rhinosinusitis episodes and medica- tion score as well as improving nasal symptoms in NAR children with RARS.
