She became a chiropractor because chiropractic helped her feel better, and feeling better gave her the courage to change her life. She was in a lot of pain, and it was challenging to think about much else but the pain. It began to rule her life. When she started to get treatment, her pain level went down, and her mind wasn't consumed with how she would navigate her pain. Reducing her pain gave her hope for the future.
