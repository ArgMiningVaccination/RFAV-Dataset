Chiropractors are specially trained to treat and protect the nervous system by relieving pressure on nerves. By doing this chiropractors are allowing your body to function at its max potential. Chiropractic Care May Be The Answer There are marshmallow like pads between your vertebrae called intervertebral discs. The discs are very tough, but can be damaged. The discs provide for movement in the spine. When discs start to degenerate the spine can become less mobile, and may even start to fuse together. The discs also provide space between the vertebrae. This is important because nerves pass through the spaces that are created by the discs. Discs also act as a shock absorbers. When movement occurs, the jelly solution inside the disc has the ability to expand and compress. If the spine become misaligned, a disc can become buldged or herniated. In some cases it may even rupture. A misalignment is not the only cause for this problem. Age can cause the disc to become weak and dehydrated.
