These procedures, which are commonly performed laparoscopically, limit the amount of food you can eat and can achieve excellent weight loss. There are some important differences to consider when deciding which procedure is best for you and your surgeon. Gastric bypass surgery Gastric bypass surgery is a surgical procedure in which the stomach is made smaller by stapling it and dividing it into two compartments. The smallest compartment is called a bag. Most of the stomach is bypassed, which means that food surrounds it, rather than through it. Gastric sleeve (vertical sleeve gastrectomy) With sleeve or gastric sleeve gastrectomy, your stomach will be made smaller by stapling and dividing most of your stomach and pulling it out of your body. The remaining stomach is in the shape of a long, narrow tube with a small food container at the end of the tube. Revision surgery for weight loss Boston Medical Center weight loss surgeons have extensive experience in the field of revision weight loss surgery. This includes the elimination of adjustable gastric band devices (Lap Band\u00ae) or conversion to another type of weight loss surgery. Our Team Boston Medical Center's Bariatric Surgery Program is recognized as a Center of Excellence by the American College of Surgeons. The team is made up of national leaders, who are experts in their fields and have performed more than a thousand surgeries.
