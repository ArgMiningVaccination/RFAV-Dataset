A machi, or spiritual leader and healer of the indigenous Mapuche people, he watches the liquid settle as he shakes the glass jar, learning of his patient's experiences, ailments and sorrows. \"I look at the urine sample and then at the lines of their palms, and I tell them about their entire lives,\" Mr. Lincovil said as he sat under a tree, a poncho over his back, outside a traditional Mapuche hut called a ruka. Then, in an intense, confidential exchange, this machi digs deep into his patient's personal history before prescribing a dose of assorted herbal infusions. Inside the ruka, several Mapuche women prepare herbal blends from about 150 varieties of plants, roots and tree bark. Each concoction is distinct, made for a patient's individual needs, according to Mr. Lincovil, 72, who twice a week sees dozens of patients at the ruka. \"This is not alternative or complementary medicine,\" he stressed. \"It's another kind of medicine.\" This [ruka](http://www.comudef.cl/?page_id=682) is not on a picturesque mountaintop or in a forest clearing in southern [Chile](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/chile/index.html?inline=nyt-geo). It is in the backyard of a busy public health clinic in La Florida, a working-class district of the capital, Santiago. While Mr. Lincovil is reading a patient's palm, doctors and nurses at Los Casta\u00f1os Family Health Center bustle about, providing Western-style health care, oblivious to what happens beyond the back gate. In the 1990s, the government of Chile began a significant venture to make its public health system more inclusive by introducing intercultural health care in areas of the country with indigenous populations. Services offered at rukas, like those provided in public clinics, are free for patients registered in the municipal public health system. The indigenous health care providers in the south of the country mostly serve the Mapuche community. But in an unusual twist, here in Santiago, programs that were established to serve a Mapuche community now cater to a predominantly non-indigenous population, patients and Mapuche healers say. The Mapuche medical center in La Florida, run by the Kallfulikan Indigenous Association, was set up as part of the government effort 15 years ago. Today, most of the patients who visit Mr. Lincovil at the ruka come from the non-Mapuche community, he said. They tend to be Chileans looking for an alternative to a Western public health care system known for its lack of resources and specialists. One such patient was Guillermo Navarro, 66, a non-Mapuche Chilean who has embraced indigenous care. Three years ago, feeling ill, he visited Western health care providers in Santiago, underwent medical examinations and was repeatedly told he was fine. He knew he was not. Mr. Navarro eventually visited Mr. Lincovil. \"The machi discovered a serious heart condition right away through my urine and my pulse,\" he said. \"I started taking the herbs and noticed the effects immediately. That's when I realized that machis have a gift.\" The Mapuche are Chile's largest indigenous group. Close to 5 percent of the nation's population of some 17 million people declared themselves of Mapuche origin in the 2002 national census, and 30 percent of them live in Santiago. The actual numbers are assumed to be much higher, but widespread racial discrimination in Chile has inhibited people from acknowledging their indigenous roots, local officials say. More recent figures are unavailable. The government's push to provide indigenous health services in the capital started as an attempt to help an underserved community that had been reluctant to embrace Western health care. A Canadian research project inspired one of the first indigenous health projects in Santiago. In 1999, the University of Ottawa developed a project around women's decision-making power in La Pintana, a low-income district on the fringes of Santiago with the largest Mapuche population in the capital. The project was done in partnership with Catholic University in Chile and with the support of the municipal government. Initial surveys detected a common problem: Many Mapuche women in La Pintana often went without health care because they did not trust conventional Western medicine or feared discrimination in public health clinics, and traveling hundreds of miles to see a machi in their communities of origin was impractical. The following year, the first intercultural health center opened in the Santiago Nueva Extremadura clinic in La Pintana, using Canadian funds and involving local indigenous organizations. A ruka was raised in the parking lot and Mr. Lincovil, the machi in La Florida, was brought in for his medicinal services. \"It was an exercise in mutual tolerance,\" said Gabriel Jim\u00e9nez, head of the municipal health department. Referring to the Mapuche and non-Mapuche populations, he said, \"There was deep-rooted distrust between the indigenous population and the huinca, and the machi was regarded with suspicion by some doctors.\" There are now a handful of programs of this kind in the capital. And several hospitals and primary health centers in the Araucan\u00eda and B\u00edo B\u00edo regions in the south of the country, where half of the Mapuche population is concentrated, have incorporated indigenous ancestral knowledge and practices. Many of these efforts are financed by the Health Ministry's Special Program on Health and Indigenous Peoples, created in 2006 within the framework of Chile's 1993 Indigenous Law, which addressed indigenous rights, protections and development. Despite repeated requests over several weeks, the Health Ministry did not provide information on how and where the special program is being carried out. However, according to Mapuche organizations in Santiago, there are about a dozen sponsored programs throughout the capital, ranging from indigenous ceremonial centers that provide Mapuche health services, to intercultural agents who advise patients in public health clinics. Few have rukas and machis treating patients in the clinics. Explanations for why a growing number of non-indigenous patients have turned to indigenous health providers vary. For Chileans like Javier C\u00e1ceres, 70, who had a tumor removed from one of his kidneys and began seeing a machi in late May, indigenous care offers an alternative to a system that was failing him. \"Conventional medicine no longer has anything to offer me,\" he said as he waited his turn outside the ruka in La Florida to receive palliative care and treatment for depression. \"I was looking for an alternative, and natural medicine can never be a bad thing,\" he said. Mapuche medicine combines ancestral knowledge, rituals, nature and spirituality, and it aims to address the root of an ailment, not just the symptoms. Some patients and providers say the conversations with the machi are often therapeutic. \"People get sick because they are paying the cost of some wrongdoing; it is their spirit that is affecting their health,\" explained Samuel Melinao, 45, a Mapuche chief, or lonko, of the Kallfulikan community running the health center in La Florida. \"Some people leave here in tears, but no one will ever know why. You don't see that in conventional medicine.\" On a sunny June morning in La Pintana, an older non-Mapuche woman arrived at a ruka built on a municipal plot of land that is now the Mapu Lawen Ceremonial Center. The woman greeted the health workers and handed one a package of mat\u00e9, an herbal infusion widely consumed in southern Chile, as a gesture of gratitude. She immediately undressed down to her undergarments and lay facedown on a massage table. \"We always begin with a therapeutic massage,\" said Juanita Huenufil, 61, of the Inchi\u00f1 Mapu Indigenous Association, which runs this ruka. \"But before that, we pray at the altar outside.\" For the Mapuche, serving non-indigenous members of their local communities is an obligation, said Mr. Melinao, the Mapuche chief. \"We are all people of the earth, and we can't provide health services only to the indigenous.
