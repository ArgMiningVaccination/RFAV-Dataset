Born in Kashmir, Singha went to university in Patna, where he gained a BSc in aeronautical engineering. After service in the Indian air force, he came to England in 1953 where he studied at the college of naturopathy and osteopathy. It was here that his interest in the curative effects of acupuncture and alternative therapies grew, and he went on to Hong Kong, where he trained as an acupuncturist and became a member of the Chinese Acupuncture Association. In the 1970s, therapies such as acupuncture and homeopathy were actually illegal in many parts of the west, but Singha's credo was always to treat the patient, not the disease, and he was enormously successful with more than 37,000 patients. He worked in surgeries in London and Suffolk and lectured, gave workshops and ran clinics in Europe and America. The author of The Secrets of Natural Health (1997), he was an inspiring teacher. Among his pupils was Harvard-trained Dr James Gordon, who went on to serve with the National Institute of Health and became the founder of the Mind/Body Centre in Washington DC, as well as setting up the annual Comprehensive Cancer Care Conference. I first met Singha in 1971 when I went to him for acupuncture to see if the treatment, as rumoured, could help my hearing. To my astonishment, my hearing improved, at times so dramatically that I could set aside my hearing aids. With a long history of audiograms and other tests, I used these techniques to monitor the efficiency of the acupuncture treatment. As a result I became intensely interested in Singha's work, and for a time accompanied him at his workshops and clinics across the world. A man of immense intelligence, humour and courage, he did not sell salvation and he did not suffer fools, but if you were in trouble, or genuinely wanting to change your life, then he would help. There is no doubt that it is through his influence and teaching that today acupuncture is now considered a commonplace therapy for a broad range of ailments and that there are many excellent doctors, trained in the disciplines of both the west and east. Singha is survived by his mother, his wife Pauline, their two daughters and a son, and his son and daughter from his first marriage to Ruth Mary Elizabeth, who predeceased him. Ian Fenton writes: Shyam Singha lived and healed with the underlying belief that what was once naturally healthy could be restored to health by natural means. The Secrets of Natural Health includes the natural food and cooking skills which were an important part of Shyam's healing technique, as was his lifelong practice of meditation, which he also taught to others. The method he taught was a meditation of love, as much his tool for healing as any material substance. It was not sentimental love, but the detached love of the master.
