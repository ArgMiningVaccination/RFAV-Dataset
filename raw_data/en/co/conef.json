Perhaps, the side effects are going to be bad enough to stop your usual exercise routine? Or maybe you're worried that working out too soon can impact your immunity? Our trainers weigh in on the question all exercise enthusiasts are wondering: Can I work out after getting the Covid-19 vaccine? Common Side Effects of the Covid-19 Vaccine You are probably well aware by now that everyone responds differently to the vaccine, making it virtually impossible to predict how your body will react. In general, individuals under 60 years old tend to experience more side effects. This is because their immune systems respond to the vaccine more vigorously than older adults. Common side effects include: - Pain, swelling, and/or redness in the arm where the shot was administered - Flu-like fevers - Chills - Body aches - Fatigue - Nausea Side effects typically start within a day or two of getting the vaccine, and depending on the severity, may impact your ability to do normal daily activities such as working out. The good news? These side effects are ultimately a sign that your immune system is responding to the vaccine and should completely disappear in a few days. What To Know About Exercising After the Vaccine First things first, there's nothing dangerous about exercising after you get the vaccine, even if you experience mild side effects such as muscle aches or fever. The only \"risk\" of exercising after the vaccine is that the side effects may reduce the quality of your workout and make it less enjoyable. There is absolutely no evidence that exercising before or after the vaccine would impact its effectiveness. As a rule of thumb, we recommend you listen to your body. If you don't feel well post-dose, take a rest day! Missing a workout or two is not going to make you lose muscle or mess with your goal of making a PR. If your symptoms are mild, another option is to do a gentler version of your standard workouts. For example, if your arm is achy, modify your full-body strength workout, and instead, focus on your legs and core. Or if you feel tired but still want to get the blood flowing, swap your five-mile run for a nice, long walk. How to Plan Workouts Around Your Vaccine Because there is no way to know how your body will respond to the vaccine, avoid making any concrete plans to exercise at least 48 hours post-dose, i.e., signing up for a non-refundable class or scheduling a private session with a trainer. Also, keep in mind that it takes two full weeks after your final dose of the vaccine until you are considered \"fully vaccinated\". If you are concerned about working out indoors with a maskless group, wait out the two weeks until doing so. The Bottom Line It's definitely OK to exercise after you get the Covid-19 vaccine as long as you feel up to it! Let your body be the guide and scale back if you need to.
