No Seriously...Why Bother? Consider for a moment if you suffer from any of the following: - Excess weight - Chronic pain - Emotional eating - Inflammation - Gas - Bloating - Fatigue - Low energy - Cravings - Constipation or irregularity - Insomnia - Acne - Addiction - Allergies - Arthritis - Headaches - Dark circles under the eyes - PMS Sadly we've gotten used to feeling \"fine.\" We've become complacent with a below average state of health and we've allowed ourselves to accept the notion that as we age, we will just not feel as great as we used to. The truth is it does not have to be this way. You can have vibrant health and we're here to show you how. What's Sabotaging Your Health Toxins are everywhere. If you live in the modern world (and we're guessing you do if you're reading this), they're impossible to escape. Everyday we're exposed to environmental pollutants, contaminated water, pesticides, herbicides, processed food, chemical preservatives, genetically modified foods, daily household products...the list goes on and on. Add to that the rise in hidden food sensitivities, which only contributes to overwhelming the body's toxic load, and we have a serious health crisis on our hands. A crisis that can largely be tackled by changing the food we eat. Let's take a closer look at what it means to be a conscious cleanser. When you hear the word \"cleanse,\" do you imagine drinking liquids only for days on end, choking down expensive supplements, or being chained to the toilet? This is an old notion of cleansing that, while effective for some, typically only leads to short-term gains. A conscious cleanse is not a quick fix. It is a 14-day reboot followed by a permanent lifestyle change. So Let Us Ask You Something... - How do you feel right now? - Are you confused about which foods are healthy for your body? - Have you thought about doing a cleanse, but are scared of the thought of failing at one more program? - Are you sick and tired of feeling sick and tired? - Are you frustrated from the on-again-off-again yo-yo diet roller coaster ride? - Are you OVER restrictive eating plans that make you feel like a failure when you have a so-called \"slip up\" ? It's not a diet. It's not about willpower or doing things \"right.\" It's about progress, not perfection. We know that you can do it! We've got your back and we're going to be with you every step of the way. No One-Size-Fits-All Approach Jo and Jules \u2014 your guides on the Conscious Cleanse \u2014 are perfect examples of the importance of customized nutrition. In 2004 Jo was hit by a truck on her bike, leaving her with chronic pain, weight gain, and debilitating depression. She was told by over 20 doctors that she would never heal, and that she would have to take Percocet for the pain and Prozac for her depression. Refusing to accept this, Jo turned to food to help her heal. When Jo and Jules came together, they put together a program to help themselves. The premise was 14 days of real food, no allergens, and lots of veggies. The most shocking part was that even though they shared these basic principles, they both got life-changing results with relatively different eating plans. Jo ate meat. Jules didn't. Jules ate grains. Jo didn't. Jules ate fruit. Jo didn't. \"After 2 weeks on the program, my chronic pain went from a 9 to a 5. I lost 15 pounds and my depression finally started to lift.\" - Jo This is how we discovered the concept that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to vibrant health. What People Are Saying About The Conscious Cleanse These girls are the real deal. The Conscious Cleanse is a program I highly recommend for anyone who wants to both feel and look better. \u2014 Bobbi Brown, founder of Bobbi Brown Cosmetics The Conscious Cleanse offers a practical and easy way to get started, offering a road map to health. \u2014 Robyn O'Brien, \"Food's Erin Brockovich\" The Conscious Cleanse provides an easy-to-follow, effective, and fun strategy that helps you burn fat, ditch nasty toxins, feel your sexiest, and turn back the clock 10 years. \u2014 J.J. Virgin, celebrity nutrition and fitness expert The Conscious Cleanse is a call to action for all who are sick and tired of being sick and tired! Be ready to dig in the dirt to grow into the person you yearn to become. \u2014 Ana T. Forrest, founder of Forrest Yoga 9 Out of 10 People Have Hidden Food Sensitivies As fate would have it, while Jo was exploring food to help her heal from her accident, Jules was also experimenting with what she believed to be an already healthy diet. \"I had been a vegetarian for years, I drank tons of water, and I did yoga everyday. Little did I know that many of the so-called health foods I was eating were contributing to my nagging health challenges.\" \u2014 Jules A whopping 90% of Americans have food sensitivities, and most of those people have no clue that the food they're putting in their body is sabotaging their health! Jules' big a-ha came when she learned about her own hidden food sensitivities and how they often go unnoticed as a result of eating the same food over and over again. Together, Jo and Jules have spent countless hours studying and researching over 200 different dietary theories. Coupled with their formal training in nutrition and health coaching, a lot of trial and error, no-nonsense conventional wisdom, and their own personal experiences, they've created the Conscious Cleanse so that you too can find your own personal blueprint for vibrant health. Over 20,000 people have done the Conscious Cleanse, experiencing the same life-changing results. Introducing Conscious Cleanse On Demand! Now you can start on your own anytime or join with a group!

What Sets the Conscious Cleanse Apart From Other Programs No Fail System Think to yourself if you've ever uttered the words, \"Ugh, I've fallen off the wagon!\" Or \"I need to get back on the wagon!\" On the Conscious Cleanse we believe that there is no such thing as a \"slip up\" or \"failure.\" Just opportunities to learn about yourself, what drives you to eat certain foods, and how food makes you feel. It's for that reason that there are no wagons on the Conscious Cleanse. This is about moving away from the diet mentality and focusing on progress not perfection. Created By Real People Jo and Jules created the 14-Day Conscious Cleanse program on a quest to tackle their own health challenges. They never set out to build a business. It's for this reason that you'll find their heart-felt style simple and accessible. They are both working moms who understand the struggles of managing day-to-day family responsibilities while keeping their health at the top of the priority list. Not One-Size-Fits-All Most programs on the market today set forth very strict guidelines. The Conscious Cleanse recognizes that no two people are the same, so we offer a flexible eating plan that celebrates each person's unique nutrition needs, allergies, and food preferences. On the Conscious Cleanse you'll customize your eating plan to maximize your results while creating a way of eating that you won't want to ever give up. Just Real Food On the Conscious Cleanse we're never going to suggest that you buy a bunch of expensive supplements. We're also not going to tell you to count calories, protein, or fat grams. If there's one thing we've learned from leading thousands of people through our program it's this - eat real food, get real results. This is the way to sustaining a path of healthy eating and vibrancy. You won't find any gimmicks or questionable food science here. And nobody has ever argued that eating more fruits and vegetables is bad for your health! Allergen Free With 9 out of 10 Americans suffering from common symptoms related to food sensitivities, our Cleanse offers an eating plan that eliminates all common allergens. It's the foods that we love and crave the most, that are often the foods causing us the most problems. By taking a short break from these allergens, we lessen our body's toxic load, while also learning to use food as medicine. This is empowerment at its finest! Tried and True We've lead tens of thousands of people through the Conscious Cleanse and the results speak for themselves. This is not a quick fix program, but one that if you put in the work up front on the cleanse, will lead you to creating long-term habits that stick. Still feeling unsure? We've been there, trust us. Change is scary. And long-term healthy habits don't appear overnight. Lifestyle changes take work and commitment, but we've developed this program to make getting healthier easier than it's ever been. We are here for YOU and your needs, whatever they may be. Your health is our #1 priority, period. So come join us, and start your journey toward a healthier, more vibrant you. We'll be with you every step of the way. So what are you waiting for?
