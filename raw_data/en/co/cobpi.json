Students should plan to present a note from their hospital or doctor to request an absence be excused due to illness. Students should also notify the instructor and ensure they read the course syllabus regarding the course policy on making up work or an exam. Students are responsible for making up any work missed due to an absence, whether it is excused or unexcused. Course Syllabus At the start of each class, students should receive a course syllabus that outlines the course content, objectives, policies, expectations, and any other information deemed important by the course instructor. Students should read through this document carefully and keep it as a reference for the duration of the course.

It is up to students to ensure they purchase the correct books, including the required editions, as assigned by the course instructor. Students are not expected to purchase the textbooks before their first class unless specifically instructed to do so. Some academic departments charge a Course Materials Fee for specific courses, such as those with science or computer labs, photography labs, art supplies, or similar costs. This fee is assessed by the academic department at a later time, directly to each student's account. Cal 1 Card The Cal 1 Card is UC Berkeley's official photo ID card and access card to many campus benefits. It functions as a key card to residence halls and campus buildings, as well as a meal card for many Cal Dining locations.

For more information and to add funds to your Cal 1 Card debit account, students should visit the [Cal 1 Card website](https://cal1card.berkeley.edu/). It is critical to upload your photo in CalCentral as soon as possible (consult with the deadline listed in your post-admissions, next step video) and prior to your arrival at Berkeley.

Classroom Diversity Studying at UC Berkeley is an opportunity for students to meet new people, be exposed to different cultures, and enjoy a global experience. We hope that when students come to Berkeley, they will spend the summer outside of the comfort of their first language and culture. We strongly advise that students select from the full range of course offerings and take classes that are different from those they would typically take back home. This is the best way to have an authentic Berkeley experience while enhancing their cultural and academic learning opportunities.
