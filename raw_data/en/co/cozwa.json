Timing Considerations for People with Current or Prior SARS-CoV-2 Infection At a minimum, defer any COVID-19 vaccination, including bivalent booster vaccination, at leastuntil recovery from the acute illness (if symptoms were present) and criteria to discontinueisolation have been met. In addition, people who recently had SARS-CoV-2 infection may consider delaying any COVID-19vaccination, including bivalent booster vaccination, by 3 months from symptom onset or positivetest (if infection was asymptomatic). Individual factors such as risk of COVID-19 severe disease, COVID-19 community level, orcharacteristics of the predominant SARS-CoV-2 strain should be taken into account whendetermining whether to delay getting a COVID-19 vaccination after infection. 4 COVID-19 Vaccine Information BriefSeptember 2, 2022 Coadministration of COVID-19 Vaccines with Other Vaccines Routine administration of all age-appropriate doses of vaccines simultaneously is recommendedas best practice for people for whom no specific contraindications exist at the time of thehealthcare visit. Extensive experience with non-COVID 19 vaccines has demonstrated that immunogenicity andadverse event profiles are generally similar when vaccines are administered simultaneously aswhen they are administered alone. Providers should offer all vaccines for which a person is eligible at the same visit. Coadministration of Influenza with COVID-19 Vaccines Providers should offer influenza and COVID-19 vaccines at the same visit, if eligible. This includes adjuvanted or high-dose influenza vaccines; administer in separate limbs. With both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 circulating, getting both vaccines is important forprevention of severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Getting both vaccines at the same visit increases the chance that a person will be up to date withtheir vaccinations.
