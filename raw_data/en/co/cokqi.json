Based on that, she starts the physical, emotional and mental bodywork. A big part in the healing process is balancing the Yin and Yang energies, the female and the male, soft and hard, light and dark. If these energies are in balance, the human feels complete again. Most roots of our diseases and discomforts lie in the disequilibrium of these energies. The problem with Western medicine in Liana's opinion is that it does not see the whole picture. It sees the symptoms and starts treatment from there. In contrast, Liana tries to dig deeper, to find out about your relationships, your childhood, your surroundings to get an overall image of your lifestyle and possible deeper causes for your disease or discomfort. Among others, self-love is an important aspect of how your body and mind are reacting to today's challenges of society and everyday life. \"You have to be open and you have to trust\" ...not only in yourself but also in circumstances and in your intuition. Very often a lack of self-love and self-worth can be a cause of illness. Liana uses all kinds of treatments to heal and to support her patients to regain harmony in mind, body and soul. She combines physical exercise, meditation, Chinese herbs and oils, [acupuncture](#acupuncture), [chakra healing](#Chakra Healing), nutrition, [macrobiotics](#macrobiotics) and other natural modalities - whatever suits the symptoms and causes of a patient's suffering. Learn more about her way of healing in this article. The mix of healing tools she uses is hardly ever the same, as each individual is unique. Often patients are surprised how precisely and quickly Liana discovers the roots of their suffering and how she develops an appropriate holistic treatment plan. \"Don't be attached to anything\" One of Liana's core beliefs is that we should not be attached to anything - having experienced herself that holding on to old circumstances or old patterns can be one of the reasons for diseases, discomfort and emotional lows. Since a lot of Liana's expertise is generated from her own experiences, she names an example when asked how she ended up in Bali. As with her accident back in Russia, it was again a push of her own body and mind to leave Belgium, where she had an established and successful health practice. Liana noticed that while she suffered from asthma in Belgium, all symptoms would disappear whenever she visited Bali. She did an experiment over a period of time, spending some weeks in Bali and again months in Belgium and finally realized it was time to leave Belgium and give Bali a try. Ever since she has been on this beautiful island and now offers her healing sessions at [The Yoga Barn](http://www.theyogabarn.com/bali-holistic-healing#liana-nenacheva). What makes Bali so special for healing? In Liana's view, Bali has a lot of feminine energy and is an important center of the Earth's energy lines which cross this island. This creates in a special energetic and spiritual setting, that cannot be found anywhere else in the world. Its special location combined with the loving locals, who seem to be aware of this great treasure and who try to preserve it by being in constant communication with the island's spirits, make Bali such a unique place for healing. Who should attend a session with Liana? Liana has no restriction on who she can treat. As her healing method is holistic, everybody who feels the urge to heal or treat body, mind and/or soul, chronic diseases, allergies or other ailments is welcome. Her sessions are not only healing on the surface, they also give guidance, wakeup calls and introduce holistic coaching aspects to cure deep within. What is Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)? Traditional Chinese Medicine combines modalities of acupuncture, herbal medicine, Chinese diet, exercises like Qi Gong and Tai-Chi and Tuina Massage. TCM aims to reawake the free flow of life energy in the body to live a life in harmony with nature. In this thousands of years old ancient Chinese health system it is assumed, that phenomenes of nature are mirrored in the human appearance and disease patterns. So always the whole well-being is considered, not only the treatment of an individual symptome. What is Acupuncture? Acupuncture as well is a Chinese treatment form in which acupuncture points are stimulated with a needle penetrating the skin. It aims to balance the energy flow in the body to gain well-being and relaxation. It is not only used to cure body pain, but also to treat depression, anxiety, stress symptoms and a lot more. What is Macrobiotics? Macrobiotics is a nutrition system, which is based on ancient wisdom and modern knowledge, focussing on the balance of Yin and Yang. It considers diet, environment, activities, and attitude of an individuum and relates health inbalances from there. If required, adjustment in the certain areas but especially in nutrition are made. The foundation of a healthy diet in terms of Macrobiotics is mainly plant-based food, seasonal and locally grown as well as moderate meal consumption. What is Chakra Healing? According to ancient sciences and cultures from around the world, our body consists of energy centres, called Chakras. They are the transmitter between the physical and the etheral body. Blockades of one or several chakras are felt by the individuum and are expressed in different symptomes of inbalances. Chakra Healing is used to re-balance the chakras. Treatment modalities include energy work like e.g. Reiki, as well as meditation, Yoga, incense burning, sound healing, [crystal healing](https://www.balispirit.com/community/blog/healing-in-bali-interview-with-a-bali-healer) and many others.
