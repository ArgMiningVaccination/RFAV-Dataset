Technical information includes a brief background on vaccine safety surveillance in Canada, adverse event following immunization (AEFI) surveillance reporting processes in Ontario, and an in-depth explanation of analytic methods used in the report as well as notes on interpretation and limitations of AEFI surveillance data. Vaccine safety surveillance in Canada In Canada, vaccines are highly regulated and monitored to ensure they are as safe as possible. They are thoroughly reviewed for efficacy and safety prior to being approved for use. Vaccine manufacturers are required to adhere to internationally accepted standards of manufacturing to ensure quality and consistency. In addition, all lots of vaccine are subject to Health Canada's lot release program which specifies standards for the production of each lot that must be met before sale in Canada.2 The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) independently reviews the available evidence on safety and efficacy.3 It also makes recommendations for the use of currently or newly approved vaccines, including identification of groups at risk for vaccine-preventable disease for whom vaccine programs should be targeted. Following approval of a new vaccine, post-marketing surveillance is initiated to ensure the ongoing monitoring of safety in the context of expansion of the population receiving the vaccine. Individual case reports of AEFIs represent an important source of data because they have the potential to identify previously unrecognized or rare AEFIs, or an increase in frequency or severity of known AEFIs which can be further evaluated. In Canada, post-marketing surveillance is a shared responsibility between Health Canada, the vaccine manufacturers, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), provinces and territories, as well as local public health authorities. PHAC and Health Canada coordinate post-marketing vaccine safety surveillance nationally while provinces and territories coordinate surveillance of AEFIs occurring within their jurisdiction in collaboration with their local partners. Reports of AEFIs made directly to vaccine manufacturers are sent to Health Canada, while AEFIs reported to provincial and territorial (P/T) public health authorities are reported to the Canadian Adverse Event Following Immunization Surveillance System (CAEFISS), maintained by PHAC. AEFI reports received by vaccine manufacturers may also be An AEFI is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that follows immunization and does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the vaccine. The adverse event may be any unfavourable or unintended sign, laboratory finding, symptom, or disease.1 Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2016: Technical Annex 2 voluntarily reported to CAEFISS; however, any serious reports are required by law to be reported by them directly to Health Canada. Public health surveillance of adverse events following immunization in Ontario The public health aim of surveillance of AEFIs in Ontario is early detection and timely response to real or perceived vaccine safety issues, and to lessen any impact on the health of individuals and immunization programs. In addition, AEFI surveillance provides important information to support and inform immunization program planning and evaluation. Ontario's specific AEFI surveillance objectives are to: Identify and investigate serious or unexpected occurrences of AEFIs, particularly for new vaccines Detect and investigate safety signals (e.g., lot-specific problems) Estimate provincial rates of reported AEFIs overall and by vaccine Report to stakeholders on the safety of publicly funded vaccines in Ontario Maintain public confidence in vaccine programs In recent years, several initiatives have been implemented to support Ontario's AEFI surveillance objectives, including: revised provincial case definitions for AEFIs, enhanced surveillance guidelines and forms, improved training and resources for public health units (PHUs), and information for health care providers. In 2013, PHO initiated the Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario , an annual comprehensive assessment of AEFIs reported following vaccines administered in Ontario in the preceding year. In 2017, PHO also launched the Vaccine Safety Surveillance tool , an interactive online tool allowing users to explore, manipulate and download vaccine safety data. Both the report and the online tool were created to facilitate ongoing assessment of vaccine safety in the province and to provide relevant, transparent and timely information about vaccine safety to support health care professionals, reassure the public that vaccines are continuously monitored for safety, and build confidence in immunization. Methods of the annual report on vaccine safety AEFI reporting process In Ontario, initial reports of AEFIs are directed to local PHUs either by telephone, or by faxing or mailing the Ontario AEFI reporting form . Reports originate from health care providers, vaccine recipients or their caregivers. The Health Protection and Promotion Act (HPPA) mandates reporting of AEFIs by specified healthcare providers (i.e., registered nurses, pharmacists and physicians).4 PHUs also receive reports Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2016: Technical Annex 3 from IMPACT (Immunization Monitoring Program ACTive) , which is a paediatric hospital-based active surveillance network that monitors select vaccine-preventable diseases and AEFIs in Canada. The two Ontario sites are in Toronto (Hospital for Sick Children) and Ottawa (Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario). AEFI reports received by PHUs are investigated, assessed, and documented according to provincial surveillance guidelines, as required by the Ontario Public Health Standards (OPHS).5 PHUs also provide support and advice to vaccine recipients or their parents and health care providers in their community. This may include recommendations with respect to additional follow-up and whether to receive further doses of vaccine for vaccine recipients who experience an AEFI. AEFI reports are entered by PHUs into the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS), the electronic reporting system for reportable diseases and adverse events in Ontario. AEFI reports are required to be reported in iPHIS within five business days of receipt of initial notification to a PHU.6,7 The minimum data elements for each AEFI report are specified in the iPHIS AEFI User Guide (2015) and RRO 1990, Reg. 569: REPORTS under the Health Protection and Promotion Act, RSO 1990, c. H.7 .4,7 PHO conducts provincial surveillance of AEFIs and provides advice and support for local PHUs in the investigation and management of AEFI reports. This role was transferred from the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC) on January 1, 2012. The MOHLTC continues to be responsible for public health legislation and standards, which enable the reporting and collection of information required for provincial surveillance. PHO transmits AEFI data to PHAC on a monthly basis for inclusion in CAEFISS, a national database containing AEFIs reported from all provinces and territories in Canada. AEFI surveillance definitions Provincial AEFI surveillance definitions are described in Appendix B (Adverse Events Following Immunization) of the OPHS, Infectious Diseases Protocol, 2016.8 According to Section 3.0 (Case Classification) of this document, AEFI reports are to be classified and entered in iPHIS as \"Confirmed\" or \"Does not meet\" based on the following definitions: Confirmed Any reported event in a vaccine recipient which follows immunization which cannot be clearly attributed to other causes. A causal relationship with the administration of the vaccine does not need to be proven. Does not meet (DNM) Any reported event in a vaccine recipient which follows immunization which has been clearly attributed to other causes. Section 5.0 (Clinical Evidence) includes specific definitions to guide further classification of AEFI reports by event-type.8 Each adverse event definition includes specific criteria which define each type of event as well as temporal criteria. Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2016: Technical Annex 4 Key definitions Vaccine The term \"vaccine\" refers to a generic active immunizing agent and includ es one or more vaccine products (e.g., \"influenza vaccine\" refers to all influenza vaccine products). Standard acronyms for vaccines are used in the report (e.g., MMR for measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine). A complete list of these acronyms and corresponding products and trade names can be found in Appendix 1 . Adverse event In the context of provincial surveillance reporting, an adverse event refers to an event which is temporally associated with receipt of vaccine and meets the corresponding event-specific provincial surveillance criteria. These criteria can be found in Appendix B (Adverse Events Following Immunization) of the OPHS, Infectious Diseases Protocol, 2016 and include clinical and temporal components.8 In the Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, adverse events are presented both individually and according to event categories. See Appendix 2 for a complete description of all specific adverse events under provincial surveillance and corresponding categories and adverse event values available in iPHIS. Of note, both the event criteria and adverse event values in iPHIS were updated on January 1, 2013. Appendix 2 also includes mapping of these values before and after this change was implemented. AEFI report An AEFI report refers to a report received by the PHU which pertains to one individual vaccine recipient who experiences one or more adverse events that are temporally associated (i.e., the event occurs after administration of the vaccine) with receipt of one or more vaccines administered at the same time (i.e., during the same day). One individual may have multiple AEFI reports if they experience adverse events following multiple doses in a series or different vaccines administered on different days. Temporal criteria Temporal criteria are estimated timelines between vaccination and onset of symptoms. Specific adverse events and their temporal criteria are described in Appendix B (Adverse Events Following Immunization) of the OPHS, Infectious Diseases Protocol, 2016.8 Events described in the report are assumed to fall within their temporal criteria; however, some adverse events may be reported which have occurred outside of these timelines but were assessed by the PHU to be clinically significant. Serious AEFI Serious AEFIs are defined as an AEFI that results in death, is life-threatening, requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. This definition is based upon International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E2A and E2D guidelines.9,10 Of note, specific components of the above serious definition, including persistent or significant disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect, are not systematically captured in iPHIS due Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2016: Technical Annex 5 to the relatively brief follow-up period of AEFIs reported in Ontario. As a result, AEFIs in Ontario that meet the serious definition are typically either hospitalized or resulted in death. Medically important events Some selected adverse events can be defined as \"medically important\", based on the World Health Organization (WHO) guidance, regardless of whether they meet the serious AEFI definition. These types of events may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent an outcome described in the serious definition (e.g., hospitalization) ; \"medically important\" events may be defined after applying medical and scientific judgement.1 In Ontario, the specific events under surveillance that meet this definition include: acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), events meningitis, myelitis, and thrombocytopenia. Medically important events which do not otherwise meet the serious definition are described separately in the Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario . Those that also meet the serious definition are described in the section on serious AEFIs. Events managed as anaphylaxis, regardless of whether they meet the serious definition, are further assessed using the internationally recognized case definition for anaphylaxis following vaccination from the Brighton Collaboration .11 All medically important events and serious AEFIs are reviewed individually by PHO to provide detailed assessment and descriptions within the annual report. Data preparation & extraction In the spring of each year, PHO leads a data clean-up initiative in collaboration with PHUs to address any data quality issues present in AEFI reports that are associated with vaccines administered in the previous calendar year. PHO electronically sends each PHU a list of AEFI reports from iPHIS that have specific data quality issues. PHUs then review and update these cases according to the instructions provided. PHO provides support to PHUs as needed and actively follows up throughout the data cleaning process to address any outstanding data issues. Data for the annual report were extracted from iPHIS on May 9, 2017. The data extract includes all reports of AEFIs that were reported in Ontario on or after January 1, 2012. This includes all AEFI reports with a vaccine administration date between January 1 and December 31 of 2016, which are the focus of this annual report, as well as all AEFI reports following vaccines administered in the preceding years starting in 2012 for an updated assessment of temporal trends. Reports of AEFIs reported in 2011 are excluded due to data quality issues. Historical trend data may change slightly from year- to-year due to late reporting and delayed data entry of adverse events occurring from previous years. Analysis of epidemiologic data Descriptive analysis of AEFIs is li mited to reports with a case classification of \"confirmed\" in iPHIS and with at least one active immunizing agent associated with the report. The following AEFI reports were excluded from the analysis: Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2016: Technical Annex 6 AEFI reports with a case classification other than \"confirmed\" or a disposition of \"does not meet definition\", \"entered in error\" or \"closed - duplicate - do not use\" in iPHIS AEFI reports that are only associated with diagnostic agents (e.g., tuberculin skin test) and/or passive immunizing agents (e.g., immune globulin), with no active immunizing agents administered at the same time. These reports are not within the scope of provincial AEFI surveillance.8 AEFI reports in non-residents of Ontario AEFI reports with a vaccine administration date not occurring between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2016 Temporal trends are assessed by year of vaccine administration. Age categories for analysis are based on key age milestones within the provincial immunization schedule (<1 year, 1- 3 years, 4-10 years, 11- 17 years, 18-64 years, 65+ years). Proportions are calculated based on reports with completed data fields in iPHIS; therefore the denominator varies by variable of analysis. AEFI reporting source is the source of the initial AEFI report to the PHU and not necessarily the only source of information in the AEFI investigation. Reporting source categories presented were mutually exclusive (i.e., physicians are a separate category from 'other health professionals' which includes nurses and pharmacists). Reporting rates were mapped using ArcMap\u00ae 10.3 to visualize the geographic distribution of AEFI reporting in the province by PHUs. For each map, reporting rates were grouped into four intervals, using the provincial reporting rate as a benchmark. The two higher categories are at or above the 2016 provincial reporting rate and the two lower categories are below this rate. The intervals were defined to identify ranges that best fit the distribution of the data. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 and Microsoft Excel 2010. Trends in reporting rates over the entire study period were assessed using Poisson regression and p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. This project has been assessed to be outside the scope of evidence generating initiatives requiring review by the PHO Ethics Review Board. Reporting rates Reporting rates for AEFIs are calculated using both doses distributed and population-based denominators. Overall reporting rates (i.e., all vaccines combined) by demographic groups (e.g., age, sex and geography) are calculated using population-based denominators in the absence of information about doses administered within these groups. Population-based denominators are derived from Ontario population estimates and projections.12,13 Net doses distributed is used for vaccine-specific reporting rates for publicly funded universal vaccines as a proxy for doses administered. Net doses distributed are estimated using vaccine distribution data extracted from Panorama, which is the provincial information system for vaccine supply management. These estimates are adjusted for wasted or reusable vaccine returned to the Ontario Government Pharmaceutical and Medical Supply Service (OGPMSS). Influenza vaccine doses also include doses that are distributed to third-party wholesale distributors as part of the Universal Influenza Immunization Program (UIIP). Vaccine-specific reporting rates for high-risk publicly funded, travel, and non-publicly funded vaccines are not calculated due to unknown vaccine distribution within the private market. Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario, 2016: Technical Annex 7 Reporting rates by the type of provider (i.e., primary care providers vs. PHUs) are estimated using a combined reporting rate for specific vaccines and age categories which are primarily delivered by one provider-type (e.g., primary care providers for infant/toddler vaccines, PHUs for school-based vaccines). Reporting rate ratios are calculated for comparison of reporting rates by sex within specific age groups and are presented as a ratio of the female reporting rate to the male reporting rate. Limitations of AEFI surveillance General limitations of AEFI surveillance data presented in the Annual Report on Vaccine Safety in Ontario are similar to other passive AEFI surveillance systems. These include inconsistent quality and completeness of AEFI reports, and reporting bias including under-reporting, particularly for mild or common reportable events, as well as stimulated (elevated) reporting which can occur in response to media coverage of a potential AEFI and subsequently increased public awareness.14 Additionally, the provincial AEFI surveillance system does not include an unimmunized group for comparison. Therefore determining whether immunization is associated with an increased risk of a specific adverse event is not possible; further study would be required. A further limitation of the analysis of AEFI surveillance data in Ontario is the lack of a population-based provincial immunization registry to estimate the number of individuals who were immunized or doses which were administered to individuals. This would enable estimation of AEFI incidence rates by vaccine or event type. In lieu of this, AEFI reporting rates are estimated using either the entire population irrespective of immunization status or vaccine doses distributed as the denominator. In this analysis, population-based denominators are used for overall system reporting rates (all vaccines combined) and for overall demographic analysis. This approach enables comparison of overall AEFI reporting trends over time and across geographic areas. However, population-based reporting rates can have limitations as a proxy for true AEFI incidence where there are variations in vaccine uptake (i.e., coverage) over time or between geographic areas. Doses distributed are widely used in analyses of passive AEFI surveillance systems14,15 and can be a reasonable proxy for doses administered for established programs with known vaccine wastage. When the amount of wastage is unknown and underestimated, this can result in underestimates of reporting rates. Additionally, in the context of new or discontinued vaccines/programs, the AEFI reporting rate using doses distributed as the denominator can be temporarily rendered invalid due to fluctuations in vaccine distribution caused by stockpiling, delayed vaccine use, or large returns of unused/expired doses. There have been substantial changes to AEFI surveillance in the province since 2012, including revised case definitions and updates to the iPHIS application on January 1, 2013. While these changes have resulted in improvements to iPHIS data quality, they do impact comparability of AEFI surveillance data and analyses of trends over time. Therefore, in-depth trend analysis is limited to AEFIs following vaccines administered on or after January 1, 2012. Finally, trends in reported AEFIs can be influenced by changes to the publicly funded program. See Appendix 3 for details of program changes in recent years that may impact AEFI surveillance data presented in the report.
