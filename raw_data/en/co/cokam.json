Is CBD legal? The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp from the legal definition of [marijuana](https://www.healthline.com/health/hemp-vs-marijuana) in the Controlled Substances Act. This made some hemp-derived CBD products with less than 0.3 percent THC federally legal. However, CBD products containing more than 0.3 percent THC still fall under the legal definition of marijuana, making them federally illegal but legal under some state laws. Be sure to check [state laws](https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx), especially when traveling. Also, keep in mind that the FDA has not approved nonprescription CBD products, and some products may be inaccurately labeled. "}
