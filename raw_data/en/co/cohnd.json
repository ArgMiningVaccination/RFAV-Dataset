NIH RESEARCH: \"we in lc patients](/long-covid#little-to-no-abnormalities) Molly's Story It was August 2022 when Molly, 34, contracted Covid-19. For over two years she had avoided the infection, but she was finally exposed at a mandatory work event. Molly had been a bit anxious about Covid-19; she had asthma and worried about the virus's effects, and family members were additionally nervous from what they read in the news about Long Covid. It was a particularly stressful time at work in a relatively new job, and Molly's symptoms were not worrisome\u2014mostly fatigue and what felt like a bad cold. She was anxious to get back to work and exercise when she started feeling better five days after testing negative. But a long and extremely grueling workday made her feel the next morning as if she had the worst hangover of her life. Symptoms of extreme fatigue and congestion returned, and Molly also began to experience rapid heart rate, known as POTS. Through conversations with her doctor and reading Reddit forums online, Molly researched Long Covid, and learned about how people were experiencing and treating their symptoms\u2014from fear mongering to support groups, supplement regimens to blood transfusions, and more. Because it hadn't been three months since she tested positive, the official period considered by medical professionals to indicate Long Covid, Molly wasn't able to seek treatment from her doctor. But on her own, she continued to research Long Covid online and tried to understand and alleviate her symptoms through various means, including heart-rate monitoring, compression stockings, salt loading, physical therapy specifically for Long Covid, and a 10-day course of Paxlovid; she eventually had her bloodwork done, her heart and lungs checked, and no structural damage was discovered. At month three, Molly was feeling as bad as ever, and growing more frustrated and worried that her symptoms might never lift. A turning point came in Molly's research when she discovered a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2629605/) that showed that blood clots and microclotting\u2014which she noticed was frequently reported in online Long Covid forums as one example of structural damage when others could not be found\u2014can be caused by the sympathetic nervous system ( [\"Historical studies on the physiology of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) attributed accelerated blood clotting to the components of the fight-flight response.\"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2629605/)). She also learned that POTS was [first recognized ](https://www.mdedge.com/clinicianreviews/article/81530/cardiology/postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-consideration/page/0/2)as a symptom soldiers suffered from after returning from the traumatic experience of war. \"Somehow that just made me realize, like, 'Oh, I could see how [my] symptoms would be triggered by the nervous system,'\" she says. Molly knew that contracting Covid-19 had been a traumatic event for her after a fearful couple of years, and that it happened at a particularly stressful time in her life. Around this time, she also discovered a [podcast](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1835170/9422276) that described people's recoveries from Long Covid using a mind-body approach. She decided to give it a try, and enrolled in two programs: first Dynamic Neural Retraining (DNRS) and then the Lightning Process (a three-day program). She took off from work in order to dedicate herself fully to the programs, which required Zoom meetings, videos, readings, and exercises. The accountability from the facilitator and the group made her feel supported, and soon she was going on long walks and bike rides that wouldn't have seemed possible just weeks before. Molly felt about 80% better after starting the program, and completely better 8 weeks later. She is now able to exercise, travel, and work without any limitations. \"My experience with recovering from Long Covid made me realize that my brain could create these very real physical symptoms,\" she says. Almost immediately, she began to feel better, which gave her confidence and hope. From there, \"I was able to recover from all of my injuries.\" Today, nine months after she initially contracted Covid-19, she feels back to normal. \"I would encourage people to give this a shot before they try other invasive things,\" she says. \"I am a very rational person, and I really feel like I did my research around all the other possible options.\" When she knew her symptoms were not caused by structural damage, and she realized the powerful links between the mind and the body, she was open to trying a mind-body approach. \"This is a big shift in the way that we think about healing and what we've been taught about how our bodies work and how Covid works. You don't need to be 100% on board. You just need to be open to it. You need to be like, 'Is this a possibility?' And like if you feel like it's a possibility, then it's worth trying out. As you start to feel better, you will get more evidence and that evidence will help shift your belief.\" Molly's story is a testament to this shift in belief, and a success story of recovering from Long Covid through a mind-body approach. BACKGROUND ON LONG COVID Long Covid is such a new and complex phenomenon that it is difficult to talk about it. A large number of people suffering after a Covid-19 infection have structural issues like lung damage, heart damage, or other physical damage. Some who were in intensive care wards are experiencing Post Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS). The United States [ has allocated $1,150,000,000](https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/statements/nih-launches-new-initiative-study-long-covid) to study Long Covid and launched a [ website](https://recovercovid.org/news-events) for people who want to follow the science as it unfolds. It will take years of investigation and randomized controlled trials to understand LC better and come up with effective treatments. At the same time, we're hearing stories of full recoveries from a particular group of Long Covid symptoms like pain, fatigue, brain fog, sensory hypersensitivity, POTS, insomnia, and more. To differentiate this specific category of long covid patients, some have begun calling this \"post-acute COVID syndrome\" or \"post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC).\" This is a similar constellation of symptoms that characterize syndromes like fibromyalgia, Chronic Lyme Disease, and ME/CFS. The symptoms are often attributed to a \"post-infectious syndrome,\" so people are seeing parallels with Long Covid. A Study at Harvard Shows Remarkable Reductions in Long Covid Symptoms There are currently no approved medications for treating Long Covid. There are proven brain retraining, or mind-body treatments for pain and fatigue. And now they have been tested for Long Covid and found to be effective, with pain going down 50%, trouble breathing going down 80%, and fatigue going down 44%, brain fog going down 67%. Michael Donnino, MD, the lead investigator of the study, is a professor and emergency medicine doctor at Harvard Medical School who takes care of Covid-19 patients in the ICU. His work has been published in NEJM, JAMA, the British Medical Journal. He and his team have recently released results for a brain-retraining treatment for Long Covid patients. As a pilot study with 23 participants, it was not randomized\u2014the next trial, with a control arm, is in progress. The study is very promising for LC patients as it shows that they experienced significant reductions in symptoms. This is a nearly identical treatment that you can see in our film, This Might Hurt. All of the people in the study had organ damage ruled out before they were admitted, and were ineligible if they had been in the ICU with Covid-19. (According to Dr. Donnino, the tests for lung damage are CXRs, CT, and PFTs; for heart damage, ECHO, MRI; for brain damage, CT and MRI; and for kidney damage, chemistry tests.) This exclusion criteria was used because the brain retraining treatment is generally recommended for people who don't have clear signs of structural damage. Watch the Replay of Our Live Seminars with Lilia Graue, MD & Michelle Wiegers & Rebecca Kennedy, MD They bring a feminist perspective to a controversial topic. Brain retraining and mind-body treatments for pain, fatigue, POTS, and Long Covid are sometimes criticized for dismissing women's suffering. These panelists discuss what these treatments have meant in their lives and the lives of their patients/clients. In the below video, Rebecca Kennedy, MD discusses how she is successfully treating Long Covid patients at Kaiser Permanente in Oregon. (Jump to the chapter at minute 54 for LC details.) The earlier part of the conversation lays out the whole treatment protocol that some people felt was not as fleshed out enough in the above video. Are the Default Assumptions about Long Covid in the Media Accurate? There is a raging debate about the cause of Long Covid (is it as-yet unidentified organic structural disease process, or is it a brain-generated/mind-body condition, or both?). New York Magazine published a thoughtful article which captures the fascinating dynamics. Access the article by Jeff Wise in New York Magazine: A quibble with Wise's piece is he doesn't discuss science-backed protocols that have been specifically tailored to address brain-induced physical symptoms, namely Pain Reprocessing Therapy (PRT) or Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET). Dozens of people have made full recoveries from Long Covid using brain retraining and told their stories on Youtube and podcasts, and it's great that he includes the recovery story of Paul Garner, MD, but more could be explored there. Wise cites CBT and graded exercise therapies as if they are the go-to psychological therapies for ME/CFS and Long Covid. These are the same therapies that compose the world of \"pain management,\" which typically does not address root causes of Long Covid and similar illnesses like ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, and Chronic Lyme Disease, though they can be helpful for some. Check out the recovery stories below for more details on how to address the root causes of symptoms, not just manage them. A related article by Natalie Shure was recently published in The New Republic: \" [We Might Have Long Covid All Wrong: Some post-Covid symptoms may be produced by the brain. Does that make them any less real](https://newrepublic.com/article/168965/might-long-covid-wrong)?\" This thoughtful article is a notable development in the politics of the Long Covid media debate. The author, Shure, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America and a supporter of Medicare for All, questions the assumption that to attribute debilitating symptoms of pain and fatigue to psychosocial stress is inherently dismissive. Shure points out that Long Covid is in many cases a functional somatic syndrome\u2014no lung or heart or organ damage is found\u2014 and so it is similar to other illnesses like functional neurological syndromes (FND), and may never have a medication that resolves it. Yet she points to hopeful stories of how people have unlearned their FND symptoms. The whole article is worth a read, especially if you're interested in the politics of understanding LC as either a biomedical disease, or a brain-generated illness. There is the same quibble with Natalie Shure's piece as with Wise's\u2014she doesn't mention the the NIH-approved treatments that can resolve pain, fatigue, and brain fog like [PRT and EAET](/evidence-based-medicine). The Emerging Biopsychosocial Model of Long Covid from The Lancet A brief commentary at the Lancet, \" [A new paradigm is needed to explain long COVID](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(22)00501-X/fulltext),\" lays out how important it is to bring in the psychosocial aspects of treatment for Long Covid, and not exclusively focus on the biological ones, which most physicians do, and which the NIH in currently doing in how they allocate funding for research. The authors visualize their proposal for biopsychosocial view of Long Covid this way: Is Long Covid Neuroplastic? After an infection has been fought off by the immune system, the nervous system can get stuck in \"sustained fight-or-flight mode,\" which has neuroplastic feedback loops that can be learned and unlearned. The New York Times published an opinion piece with a helpful perspective on Long Covid by medical professors at Harvard and Johns Hopkins. [The Truth About Long Covid is Complicated. Better Treatment Isn't.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/18/opinion/long-covid-treatment.html) They write that \"psychosocial strain\" of the pandemic lockdowns was a likely contributor to Long Covid. A study published in JAMA Psychiatry found that psychological distress was predictive of increase risk of developing Covid-19. How are Long Covid Patients Being Dismissed? Many Long Covid patients are being met with disbelief by their doctors. They are questioned as if they don't understand their own bodies, or they're told \"it's stress,\" \"it's anxiety,\" \"it's all in your head,\" simply because no objective evidence of tissue damage was detected. This is a well-known problem of stigmatizing patients, especially women, whose syndromes are not clearly understood\u2014yet\u2014through biomedical investigation. Our film This Might Hurt explores the latest neuroscience that many long-term illnesses, while perhaps triggered by an initial infection, can be learned and locked in by the nervous system and cause disability. Through reducing fear, calming the nervous system, and doing brain retraining, some illnesses can be unlearned and reversed. We're seeing some promising signs that our film is relevant for a subtype of LC patients. Dr. Schubiner's Clinical Experience with Long Covid Patients is Encouraging During Q&As for the film This Might Hurt, Dr. Schubiner has reported that he has seen a few patients with Long Covid and has helped them recover using the same mind-body paradigm we explore in the film. He is cautiously optimistic that a significant portion of the millions with Long Covid have a neuroplastic, reversible condition. Many scientists are researching this, and there is much that is still unknown. For those confronting a terrifying, upending condition, these anecdotes provide some hope. Even places like the Mayo Clinic are [releasing statements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otg1kuUHrrM) saying \"The mind and body do work together. And both need to be addressed in treatments for this condition [long covid].\" Long Covid Recovery Stories Perhaps as many as 30% of Long Covid patients are experiencing symptom improvements by [receiving a Covid vaccine injection](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/vaccines-long-covid). And some people are recovering by using practices from mind-body medicine, as detailed in their stories linked to below. You can read about the five-step process for unlearning the pain -> fear -> pain cycle, and many symptoms of Long Covid, [here](/unlearningpain). An Infectious Disease Doctor Develops Long Covid and Tells His Remarkable Story Dr. Paul Garner is a \"medical researcher and clinician who specializes in the biological communication between the body and the brain.\" He fell ill for months with Long-Haul Covid Syndrome and wrote extensively about his debilitating symptoms in the British Medical Journal (BMJ). He recovered through neuroplastic retraining and described what helped him in the [BMJ ](https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/01/25/paul-garner-on-his-recovery-from-long-covid/)and [in the Guardian](https://thismighthurtfilm.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?e=6ffb4ff626&id=d85528c15d&u=97a26dca0234cbf51359601cb). And here is a video of him telling his story: Here's a young man who successfully used meditation to overcome debilitating fatigue: \" [Defogging My Life](https://www.curablehealth.com/podcast/fiona-recovery-story-chronic-fatigue-syndrome)\" Podcast Interview with Fiona about overcoming Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). This is of course not about Long Covid, however, ME has very similar post-infection symptoms as Long Covid, so there is much in this interview that is also relevant for Long-Haulers. [Collection of Long Covid Success Stories by Sarah Rainwater and friends](https://www.longcovidcured.com) [\"How I Finally Healed When I stopped Believing a Diagnosis of Incurable,\" ](https://tinybuddha.com/blog/how-i-finally-healed-when-i-stopped-believing-a-diagnosis-of-incurable/)an ME/CFS Recovery story by Rebecca Tolin. She describes how she overcame post-exertional malaise. \" [Body Politic](https://www.wearebodypolitic.com/covid19)\" is an online group that is organizing around Long Covid and offering community, and they have meditation groups that support people struggling with LC. Some of the members participate in brain retraining programs like DNRS or Gupta Program, or others. Here is a success story from DNRS (we are not affiliated with them, but many people find it helpful). For some people, changing thoughts and beliefs and reducing fear is sufficient to recover and heal, whereas for others doing emotional processing along the lines you can see in This Might Hurt is a critical step in their recovery. POTS-specific story Can the brain cause symptoms this severe? Unable to get out of bed for weeks, months. Brain fog so thick you can't think straight. How on earth could this be caused by the brain or by psychological trauma? Makes no sense. And yet, the brain can cause one of the most severe symptoms of all, a coma. A recent Oscar-nominated Netflix documentary, [Life Overtakes Me](https://www.netflix.com/title/81034980), directed by Kristine Samuelson and John Haptas, explores a compelling example of this phenomenon. More than four hundred of children of Syrian immigrants who sought refuge in Sweden began falling into comas. Why? As Rachel Aviv reported in her article \" [The Trauma of Facing Deportation](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/the-trauma-of-facing-deportation),\" when the Swedish government tried to deport Syrians immigrants back to their war-torn country, where their children had witnessed family members being killed, something quite remarkable happened\u2014their children went into \"resignation syndrome.\" The resignation coma is characterized by being \"totally passive, immobile, lacks tonus, withdrawn, mute, unable to eat and drink, incontinent and not reacting to physical stimuli or pain.\" Aviv reports: \"An illness that is said to exist only in Sweden, and only among refugees. The patients have no underlying physical or neurological disease, but they seem to have lost the will to live. The Swedish refer to them as de apatiska, the apathetic. 'I think it is a form of protection, this coma they are in,' Hultcrantz said. 'They are like Snow White. They just fall away from the world.' After being tended to and fed through a tube for months, the children sometimes emerge from the coma if their parents are given a reprieve by immigration officials and allowed to stay in Sweden; and if they talk about it in the child's presence. \"Resignation syndrome\" is a potent example of the power of the mind-body connection, and of the bio-psycho-social nature of many illnesses. Why is this condition mostly limited to Western Asia-born immigrants in Sweden? It's a question that points to the social factor of many illnesses, that societal forces can give shape to physical symptoms. It can be so counterintuitive to think that the brain could initiate or maintain unremitting symptoms of fatigue, pain, brain fog, rapid heart rates, and insomnia. \"There's no way the brain could be doing something this severe.\" Yet if biopsychosocial forces can put people into a coma, it can also initiate a whole range of symptoms that are less debilitating.

So many doctors say \"oh, it's probably stress or anxiety,\" and send patients off. This makes patients feel like they're not being taken seriously. This is why we made the film, This Might Hurt, to show what a step-by-step, evidence-based mind-body treatment looks like for when doctors \"can't find anything wrong.\" \" [Explaining the Unexplainable: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/unlearn-your-pain/201606/explaining-the-unexplainable-chronic-fatigue-syndrome)\" by Dr. Howard Schubiner, Psychology Today \" [Is Long COVID a Mind-Body Syndrome?](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-new-normal/202112/is-long-covid-mind-body-syndrome)\" by James F. Zender Ph.D., Psychology Today Dr. Zender explains how psychological approaches to Long Covid can help some sufferers find relief: \"Some innovative approaches have recently been developed to further test if long COVID symptoms are due to structural or neurocircuit issues, or a combination of both. Once structural problems have been ruled out, psychological techniques to reduce fear and anxiety, as well as instill hope, can be effective in restoring quality of life and symptom abatement.\" Long Covid Without Positive Serology A few studies found that between 50-60% of people with Long Covid symptoms did not have positive serology (antibodies) for Covid. Of course, antibodies fade over time, and it's possible that antibodies were not detected even though someone was infected with Covid. But a [couple](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2788894) of [studies](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/226713/covid-19-antibodies-persist-least-nine-months/) have shown that 99% of people who tested positive for a Covid-19 infection have antibodies six and nine months later. That means it is possible that as many as half of Long Covid patients were never infected with Covid-19. Even if some LC patients have never been infected with Covid, their symptoms are just as real as if they had been. The pain is still pain, the fatigue is still fatigue. Their symptoms are just as real as other chronic pain patients who have fibromyalgia or migraine headaches that do not have structural damage that explains their symptoms. Brain-generated symptoms are real, debilitating, and very often quite treatable when identified. What are the theories about Long Covid being a structural disease process? It's still early in the research process for understanding how the novel coronavirus affects people long-term. [Journalist Julia Belluz at Vox](https://www.vox.com/22369734/long-hauler-covid-vaccine) summarized the current theories after a conversation she had with Yale immunologist, Akiko Iwasaki, PhD. The theories are: (1) there may be reservoirs of virus or virus fragments that are still causing damage to particular organs or the nervous system. (2) the havoc caused by Covid may have opened the door to latent pathogens. (3) there may be an auto-immune reaction where the immune system is accidentally attacking its own body. (4) gut bacteria is dysregulated. (5) organ damage or other damage is triggering symptoms. It's possible that several of these theories are true, and that different subtypes of Long Covid have different combinations of these five explanations or even mechanisms that are not yet theorized. What is not mentioned in the Vox piece or a similar [New York Times piece](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/02/19/science/long-covid-causes.html) is that a significant portion of patients may have Long Covid but no identifiable damage or disease process that explains their symptoms. It's commonly known as \"functional\" or \"medically unexplained\" symptoms, and before the pandemic began, this category already accounted for as many as 10-30% of all emergency room and doctor visits. It's very common, and it's very frustrating for doctors and patients. It is highly likely that a subtype of Long Covid is \"functional,\" meaning minimal or no damage, but horrible symptoms. As with functional syndromes like fibromyalgia (which has a similar constellation of symptoms like widespread pain, fatigue, insomnia, brain fog), the symptoms can be dramatically reduced. Neuroplastic brain retraining (or a mind-body approach) can be very effective for functional somatic disorders, and there are evidence-based treatments available for them once they are identified. One of them, Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET) has been shown to be effective in a randomized trial for patients with fibromyalgia, and was listed as a \"best practice\" by the Department of Health and Human Services on the strength of the data. Also, it is possible that even for people who do have some structural damage, brain retraining may still be an effective method for reducing fear and unlearning symptoms. It will take good research to sort that out. NIH Study finds \"Little To No Abnormalities\" in LC Patients A [new NIH study](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/epdf/10.7326/M21-4905) finds that people with LC do not have damage that explains their symptoms. While some people will find this dispiriting, it can also be viewed as very good news. It means it's possible to use brain retraining to reduce fear, regulate the nervous system, and unlearn fatigue and pain. NPR interviewed one of the lead authors, Michael Sneller, MD, who conducted this study for the National Institutes of Health. MICHAEL SNELLER, MD: So the thing that has struck me most now in a year and a half of seeing these patients and extensively testing them is that we are finding little to no abnormalities. STEIN: He's tried every test he can think of. SNELLER: Echocardiogram, pulmonary function tests, X-rays, brain MRIs, you name it, laboratory markers of organ dysfunction - not seeing any of that - and precious little evidence of immune activation looking just at the sort of the standard markers of inflammation. I'm running out of tests to do, basically. STEIN: But Sneller hasn't ruled out anything and is still looking, including doing more detailed studies of the immune system, as well as psychological testing, because he agrees people are suffering real, long-lasting problems. SNELLER: It's 100% real. These people have these symptoms - absolutely. The question is what's causing them. You know, just because you can't find - I mean, anxiety produces real symptoms. The symptoms are real. It's just they're not due to any damage we can pinpoint. STEIN: But Akiko Iwasaki at Yale is convinced the immune system is playing a key role. AKIKO IWASAKI, PHD: There is definitely something going on there. We need to know what that is. You know, we need to understand what's going on in each patient because the treatment option will be very different depending on what they actually have. Our take on this scientific dispute: You could choose to decide Dr. Iwasaki is correct or Dr. Sneller and Dr. Donnino (who did the brain retraining at Harvard) are correct\u2014they are smart researchers who fundamentally disagree\u2014in fact they represent different worldviews of how healing works. Why pick one over the other? We think the views of Dr. Sneller and Dr. Donnino are more hopeful for two reasons: 1. It means the body is healthy and not damaged\u2014that is an extremely powerful message that can trigger the placebo effect and calm the nervous system. 2. There are proven treatments for functional syndromes, also known as mind-body or brain-generated illnesses. If you scroll up and listen to the LC recovery stories, you can get a sense of how brain retraining can lead to a full or substantial recovery through changing the brain-body connection. (Brain retraining can also lead to changes in biomarkers for stress and can alter the neuroanatomy of the brain.) The view that Dr. Iwasaki represents is to wait for science to pinpoint the biomarkers of Long Covid and develop medications which will most likely take years to make it to market, if it ever happens. We think this is a more pessimistic view that is not in line with the latest neuroscience and advances in clinical medicine for functional syndromes, as depicted in our film.
