They reflect the current evidence- based practice and consensus of content experts. These protocols are not intended to be absolute treatment documents, rather, as principles and directives which are sufficiently flexible to accommoda te the complexity of patient management. No protocol can be written to cover every situation that a provider may encounter, nor are protocols a substitute for good judgment and experience. Providers are expected to utilize their best clinical judgment and deliver care and procedures according to what is reasonable and prudent for specific situations. However, it will be expected that any deviations from protocol shall be documented and reviewed, according to regional procedure. THESE PROTOCOLS ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR GOOD CLINICAL JUDGEMENT 5 Version 22.0 Effective 02 -25-2022 Introduction The Statewide Basic Life Support Adult and Pediatric Treatment Protocols reflect the current acceptable standards for basic life support (BLS) delivered by certified first responders (CFR), and emergency medical technicians (EMT) in New York State. Advanced life support (ALS) protocols are developed separately and subject to regional variation. Advanced providers are also responsible for, and may implement, the standing orders indicated for BLS care. Protocols are listed for each provider level and STOP lines indicate the end of standing orders. Generally, BLS interventions should be completed before ALS interventions. Bullets are used throughout this document. Many processes are not sequential and tasks should be performed as most appropriate for patient care. Regional protocols and policies may accompany these BLS protocols. The color -coded format of the protocols allows each BLS professional to easily follow the potential interventions that could be performed by level of certification. CRITERIA Any specific information regarding the protocol in general CFR AND ALL PROVIDER LEVELS CFR and EMT standing orders These are also standing orders for all levels of credential above EMT CFR STOP EMT EMT standing orders These are also standing orders for all levels of credential above EMT EMT STOP MEDICAL CONTROL CONSIDERATIONS Opti ons listed in this section are common considerations that medical control may choose to order as the situation warrants KEY POINTS/CONSIDERATIONS Thes e protocols do not supplant regionally required equipment specifications or the items required under Public Health Law and Regulations 6 Version 22.0 Effective 02 -25-2022 These protocols should not serve as a demonstration of required equipment or training, as regional and agency variations will exist \"*if equipped and trained\" is noted to indicate interventions that may be performed if an agency or region chooses to implement these variations. These are not required. 7 Version 22.0 Effective 02 -25-2022 Pediatric Definition and Discussion The period of human development from childhood to adulthood is a continuum with the transition occurring during puberty. Since the completion of this transition is not sharply demarcated and varies among individuals, it is difficult to set a precise age when childhood ends and adulthood begins. It follows that use of such a definition to determine when a pediatric or an adult protocol is to be used is also problematic. The medical control agreement contained within these protocol document states, \"providers are expected to utilize their best clinical judgment and deliver care and procedures according to what is reasonable and prudent for specific situations.\" The determination of when to utilize an adult or pediatric protocol shall be no different and subject to the same CQI review that is compulsory with any other aspect of prehospital emergency care. As a general guideline for use with these protocols, the following definition has been established: Pediatric protocols should be considered for patients who have not yet reached their 15th birthday 8 Version 22.0 Effective 02 -25-2022 Acknowledgements The State and Regional Emergency Medical Services Councils, State and Regional Emergency Medical Advisory Committees, State Emergency Medical Services for Children Advisory Committee, Regional Program Agency staff, and all who contributed to this and previous versions of these protocols.

Follow common sense, apply good clinical judgment, and follow regionally approved polices and protocols. Consider dispatch information while responding: Type of response (emergency/non) Prevailing weather Road conditions Time of day Location of call EMD determinant/mechanism of illness/injury Number of anticipated patients Need for additional resources Survey the scene - do not approach the scene unless acceptably safe to do so. Stage proximate to the scene until scene is rendered acceptably safe: Environmental hazards CBRNE hazards Evidence of unknown powders/other unknown substances/sharps Indicators of a chemical suicide Mechanical hazards Violence/threat of violence Traffic hazards Number of actual patients Activate local MCI plan as necessary Consider shelter -in-place or evacuation based on hazards; consider additional support resources: ALS intercept Additional ambulance Air medical services EMS physician Fire department/heavy rescue Law enforcement Utilities Ensure universal precautions/personal protective equipment appropriate to the task. For situations in which EMS PPE would not sufficiently protect the provider, the pr ovider should assist the other emergency responders in determining response objectives based on life safety, property preservation, and environmental protection. Establish or participate in unified command or ICS structure, as appropriate. For MCIs, establish a command structure as soon as possible. EMT CFR AND ALL PROVIDER LEVELS 11 Version 22.0 Effective 02 -25-2022 General Approach to the Patient Applies to adult and pediatric patients CRITERIA This general approach guidance document is intended to provide a standardized framework for approaching the patient. Follow common sense, apply good clinical judgment, and follow regionally approved polices and protocols. History of present illness What events led up to the EMS contact? Use SAMPLE, OPQRST or similar to guide approach to events/illness/complaint Pertinent past medical history/medications/allergies Obtain additional pertinent medical information from the family and bystanders Physical exam Focused or complete exam directed by patient presentation, chief complaint, and mechanism of injury or illness Check for medical alert tags Patient examination - primary Identify and treat apparent life-threats including massive hemorrhage Airway Identify and correct any existing or potential airway obstruction while protecting the cervical spine if appropriate Is the airway patent? Will it stay open on its own? Is intervention (OPA, NPA, suction) necessary? Breathing Apply oxygen and/or positive pressure ventilations, as indicated See \"Resources: Oxygen Administration\" protocol Is breathing present? Is breathing too fast or too slow to sustain life? Is the patient speaking effectively? Circulation Control serious life-threatening hemorrhage immediately upon discovery Refer to the \"Trauma: Bleeding/Hemorrhage Control\" protocol Is a pulse present? Is th e pulse too fast or too slow to sustain life? Is the pulse regular or irregular? EMT CFR AND ALL PROVIDER LEVELS 12 Version 22.0 Effective 02 -25-2022 What is the skin color, condition, and temperature? Is there serious external hemorrhage? Is there evidence of internal hemorrhage or signs of shock? Continually reassess and correct any existing or potentially compromising threats to the ABCs Disability Determine level of consciousness Alert, Voice, Pain, Unresponsive (AVPU) GCS Pupils Cincinnati Pre-Hospital Stroke Screen (or other regionally approved stroke scale) Expose Appropriately expose patient as needed to perform complete physical exam and perform necessary interventions Are exposed patients sufficiently protected from public view? Transport Decision See \"General Approach: to Transportation\" protocol Secondary patient assessment Vital signs (repeated frequently if abnormal or critical patient) Pulse rate and quality Respirations rate and quality Blood pressure Obtain BP by palpation only if necessary Skin color, condition, and temperature Blood glucose determination, if approved, equipped, and appropriate Locate records including: MOLST, eMOLST, or DNR as appropriate MEDICAL CONTROL CONSIDERATIONS Medical control may give any order within the scope of practice of the provider Options listed in this section are common considerations that medical control may choose to order as the situation warrants KEY POINTS/CONSIDERATIONS If a patient chooses to refuse care or transportation, please refer to \"Resources: Refusal of Medical Attention\" protocol and regional policy Develop a prehospital patient impression by combining all information available in the history of present illness, past medical history, and physical exam Submit a verbal report to the responsible medical personnel upon arrival at the emergency department 13 Version 22.0 Effective 02 -25-2022 Label any items that were transported with the patient such as ECGs, paperwork from facilities, medications, or belongings Complete a patient care report in compliance with state, regional, and agency policy 14 Version 22.0 Effective 02 -25-2022 General Approach to Transportation Applies to adult and pediatric patients CRITERIA This general approach guidance document is intended to provide a standardized framework for patient transport. Follow common sense, apply good clinical judgment, and follow regionally approved policies and procedures. Ongoing scene and patient assessment Scene safety is not just a yes/no question; it involves continual situational awareness Take note of the effect of patients and bystanders Don't get pinned into area Be aware of your egress routes Consideration for ALS intercept and air medical services should be made based on agency and regional protocol, policy, patient needs, regional capabilities, and travel times. Do not delay transport waiting for ALS to arrive. The closest ALS may be at a facility Transport to the closest appropriate receiving facility in accordance with regional facility destination policies for travel time, facility capabilities, and NY State designation The closest appropriate facility may not be the nearest facility even for patients in extremis such as those in cardiac or respiratory arrest Ensure ongoing patient assessment, check for improving / deteriorating patient condition, and respond accordingly. Check to ensure that previously initiated therapies remain functional Carefully consider use of appropriate emergency warning devices for transport : Lights and siren use is a medical intervention - does the patient condition warrant the use? Provide a brief pre- arrival report to receiving facility in accordance with regional policy. Ensure early notification for serious trauma, STEMI, stroke, and sepsis MEDICAL CONTROL CONSIDERATIONS Medical control may assist with questions regarding patient care or if there are complex medical conditions requiring additional guidance Medical control may assist with the determining the most appropriate receiving facility KEY POINTS/CONSIDERATIONS If a patient chooses to refuse care or transportation, please refer to \"Resources: Refusal of Medical Attention\" protocol, as well as agency and regional policy EMT CFR AND ALL PROVIDER LEVELS 15 Version 22.0 Effective 02 -25-2022 General Approach to Safety Restraining Devices Applies to adult and pediatric patients CRITERIA This general approach guidance document is intended to provide a standardized framework for patient transport. Follow common sense, apply good clinical judgment, and follow regionally approved policies and procedures. All passengers including patients and EMS personnel should be restrained It is not permissible or safe to have a parent or caregiver hold a child in his or her arms or lap. The child and parent/caregiver should each be restrained appropriately All patients on the stretcher must be secured when the vehicle is in motion or the stretcher is being carried or moved; stretcher harness straps should always be used A child's own safety seat - when available and intact - can be used to restrain a child during transport. He or she should be placed in the device and the device should be belted to an ambulance seat. If the child is the patient, the seat should be secured onto the stretcher and the child belted in the child safety seat If the ambulance service does not have an ambulance equipped with child safety seats or restraint, it is recommended that the agency purchase approved child safety seat(s) or restraint(s) for each ambulance. More than one size seat/restraint may be needed as location of the restraint (i.e., stretcher, or captain's chair) may not accommodate all size children Agencies should routinely train EMS personnel in the use of various child safety seats/restraints available and have a policy for how injured and uninjured children will be transported As an agency considers the purchase of new vehicles, or is retrofitting current vehicles, design considerations, such as integrated child restraints, should be considered All safety seats/restraints should be used according to manufacturer's recommendations KEY POINTS/CONSIDERATIONS If a patient chooses to refuse safety restraints, please refer to \"Resources: Refusal of Medical Attention\" protocol, as well as agency and regional policy EMT CFR AND ALL PROVIDER LEVELS 16 Version 22.0 Effective 02 -25-2022 Extremis/Cardiac Arrest Protocols 17 Version 22.0 Effective 02 -25-2022 Cardiac Arrest For pediatric, see \"Cardiac Arrest -

They may act as a resource to the EMS provider when caring for a VAD patient One set of fully charged batteries provides 8-10 hours of power: If the battery or power is low, the batteries need to be replaced immediately Assist with the replacement of batteries if directed by patient/caregiver Never disconnect both batteries at once as this can cause complete loss of VAD power Keep the device components dry The most common complication in VAD patients is infection. VAD patients are susceptible to systemic illness, sepsis, and septic shock due to their abdominal driveline as a conduit of infection Patients with a VAD are highly preload dependent and afterload sensitive. Low flow alarms are frequently due to MAP >90 mmHg. The devices are sensitive to alterations in volume status and careful volume resuscitation is often necessary VAD patients are heavily anticoagulated and susceptible to bleeding complications Patients may have VF/VT and be asymptomatic Controller Device Normal Values: Heartmate II Heartmate 3 HVAD Speed 8,000- 10,000 RPM 6,000 RPM 2400- 3200 RPM Power 22.0 Effective 02 -25-2022 Trauma Protocols 61 Version 22.0 Effective 02 -25-2022 Trauma Patient Destination Applies to adult and pediatric patients 62 Version 22.0 Effective 02 -25-2022 Amputation Applies to adult and pediatric patients Refer immediately to the \"Trauma: Bleeding/Hemorrhage Control\" protocol, as indicated ABCs and vital signs Elevate and wrap the stump with moist sterile dressings and cover with dry bandage Consider spinal motion restriction, refer to \"Trauma: Suspected Spinal Injuries\" protocol Provide or direct care for amputated part: Moisten sterile dressing with sterile saline solution and wrap amputated part Place the severed part in a water -tight container, such as a sealed plastic bag Place this container on ice or cold packs, using caution to avoid freezing the limb CFR AND EMT STOP KEY POINTS/CONSIDERATIONS Distal amputations (those distal to wrist or ankle) do not typically require a trauma center Transport the amputated part with the patient, if possible, but do not delay transport to search for amputated part Consider medical control consultation if there is uncertainty regarding appropriate destination facility EMT CFR AND ALL PROVIDER LEVELS 63 Version 22.0 Effective 02 -25-2022 Avulsed Tooth Applies to adult and pediatric patients CRITERIA For permanent teeth only ABCs and vital signs Hold the tooth by the crown (not the root) Quickly rinse the tooth with saline before reimplantation, but do not brush off or clean the tooth of tissue Remove the clot from the socket; suction the clot, if needed Reimplant the tooth firmly into its socket with digital pressure Have the patient hold the tooth in place using gauze and bite pressure Report to facility staff that a tooth has been reimplanted CFR AND EMT STOP KEY POINTS/CONSIDERATIONS The best transport medium for an avulsed tooth is in the socket, in the appropriate situation The best chance for success is when reimplantation occurs within five minutes of the injury If the patient has altered mental status, do not reimplant If the patient must be transported in a supine position, do not reimplant Do not reimplant if the alveolar bone/gingiva are missing, or if the root is fractured Do not reimplant if the patient is immunosuppressed, or reports having cardiac issues that require antibiotics prior to procedures If the patient is not a candidate for reimplantation and avulsed a permanent tooth, place the avulsed tooth in interim storage media (commercial tooth preservation media, lowfat milk, patient's saliva, or saline) and keep cool.

pulse oximetry and/or blood glucose, when clinically indicated Focused exam - As dictated by the patient's complaint (if any) Medical decision- making capacity determination - As defined below Patients at the scene of an emergency who demonstrate the ability to understand the nature and consequences of their medical care decisions shall be allowed to make decisions regarding their medical care, including refusal of evaluation, treatment, or transport A patient, who is evaluated and found to have any one of the following conditions shall be considered incapable of making medical decisions regarding care and/or transport and should be transported to the closest appropriate medical facility under implied consent: Altered mental status from any cause Age less than 18 unless an emancipated minor or with legal guardian consent Attempted suicide, danger to self or other, or verbalizing suicidal intent Acting in an irrational manner, to the extent that a reasonable person would believe that the capacity to make medical decisions is impaired Unable to verbalize (or otherwise adequately demonstrate) an understanding of the illness and/or risks of refusing care Unable to verbalize (or otherwise adequately demonstrate) rational reasons for refusing care despite the risks No legal guardian available (in person or by telephone) to determine transport decisions P atient consent in these circumstances is implied, meaning that a reasonable and medically capable adult would allow appropriate medical treatment and transport under similar conditions Law enforcement should be considered, if needed, to facilitate safe management of patients who lack capacity and require involuntary transport Capacity is a clinical decision, therefore, it is not necessary for law enforcement to place a patient in their \"protective custody\" in order to safely manage those whom lack capacity and require transportation for further evaluation and treatment 89 Version 22.0 Effective 02 -25-2022 Responsibilities of Patient Care The provision of patient care is a responsibility given to certified individuals who have completed a medical training and evaluation program specified by the NYS Public Health or Education Laws and subject to regional and State regulations or policy. Prehospital providers are required to practice to the standards of the certifying agency (DOH) and the medical protocols authorized by the local REMAC. Patient care takes place in many settings, some of which are hazardous or dangerous. The equipment and techniques used in these situations are the responsibility of locally designated, specially trained, and qualified personnel. Emergency incident scenes may be under the control of designated incident commanders who are not emergency medical care providers. These individuals are generally responsible for scene administration, safe entry to a scene, or decontamination of patients or responders. Pursuant to the provisions of Public Health Law, the individual having the highest level of prehospital medical certification, and who is responding with authority (duty to act) is responsible for providing and/or directing the emergency medical care and the transportation of a patient. Such care and directi on shall be in accordance with all NYS standards of training, applicable state and regional protocols, and may be provided under medical control. 90 Version 22.0 Effective 02 -25-2022 Transfer of Patient Care CRITERIA Providers are responsible for the patient while in their care. Transferring or receiving providers will not be responsible for his or her counterpart's actions Patients may be transferred to a provider with the same or higher level of certification Patients may be transferred to a provider with a lower level of certification provided the patient is not anticipated to require higher -level care and the lower level provider has formally accepted the transfer of care When transferring patients, both the receiving and transferring providers should: Ensure that all patient information is transferred to the receiving provider, such as chief complaint, past medical history, current history, vital signs, and care given prior to the transfer of care Assist the receiving provider until they are ready to assume patient care Be willing to accompany the receiving provider to the facility if the patient's condition warrants or if the receiving provider requests it, as resources allow All personnel and agencies must comply with NYSDOH BEMS policy statement 12- 02 (or updated version) regarding documentation: Both providers will complete a Patient Care Report (PCR), as appropriate, detailing the care given to the patient while in their care The receiving provider must briefly document care given prior to receiving the patient Providers within the same agency may utilize the same PCR (as technology and agency/regional/state policy allow) MEDICAL CONTROL CONSIDERATIONS Resolution of any disagreements between transferring and transporting providers KEY POINTS/CONSIDERATIONS Any disparity between the providers must be resolved by on- line medical control or the provider of higher certification must transport with the patient In situations involving multiple patients or mass casualty incidents, EMS providers may field-triage patients to care and transportation by EMS providers of lower level of certification as resources allow A standardized process of transfer of care may be implemented by regional systems EMT CFR AND ALL PROVIDER LEVELS "}
