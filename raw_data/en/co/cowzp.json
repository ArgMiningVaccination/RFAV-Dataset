For example, platinum based chem- otherapy (PBC) is known to caus e ototoxicity, presenting as hearing loss and tinnitus. There is a paucity of good -quality information and support offered to patients who ex- perience ototoxicity, which can subsequently lead to many being undiagnosed and un- treated. In order to identify gaps in the literature, a systematic review was carried out. The sys- tematic review aimed to collect evidence about the prevalence and severity of chemo- therapy -induced hearing loss and tinn itus. However , no reliable prevalence, incidence or severity of ototoxicity was reported, though those with ototoxicity reported having a lower quality of life ( QoL ). To seek further information, grey literature in the form of online health forums was expl ored to identify what people experiencing ototoxicity were discussing with one another. The forum review gave a unique insight into online forums and people's thoughts about ototoxicity and their experiences . Six major themes emerged from the forum review, including the nature of ototoxicity, time of experienced ototoxicity, information on ototoxicity, quality of life, therapies and online social sup- port. These two reviews then led to the development of two clinical studies: the first being a mixed method s tudy identifying the severity and the impact of QoL in those living with the effects of ototoxicity. Results from the qualitative aspect found that more awareness is needed surrounding ototoxic effects and the impact this has on Qo L, specifically, so- cial Q oL. Furthermore, experiences with clinicians have a major role in determining whether people receive guidance and support for their symptoms. Clinical staff that do not engage, refer or offer support can have a negative impact on the QoL of their pa- tients, compared to those that listen and offer guidance . Second, a cross -sectional study was developed to identify the prevalence and severity of ototoxicity using extended high -frequency audiometry in patients who received platinum based chemotherapy . This stud y recruited 7 participants prior to being suspended due to COVID -19 research restrictions . Finally, two online surveys were developed to identify acceptability of an ototoxicity monitoring programme for those undergoing chemotherapy. One survey was target ed at those who had received chemotherapy, the other was aimed at healthcare profession- als specialising in hearing. The surveys showed that many people were unaware of oto- toxicity as a side effect of chemotherapy, and that healthcare professionals such as ENTs and Audiologists did not unanimously agree on an ototoxicity monitoring protocol, or which department is respon sible for monitoring ototoxicity. 3 Ototoxicity is an understudied, yet important late effect of platinum based chemother- apy and more information, awareness and support is needed for adults living with and beyond cancer . 4 Abbreviations AFI: Attentional Function Index AHRQ: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ASHA: American Speech -Language -Hearing Association BSA: British Society of Audiology CBT Cognitive Behavioural C&C: Studies -Depression CTRL1: Copper HL: Hearing dB SPL: decibels EHF: Extended high -frequency EORTC -QLQ: The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire FACT: Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy FACT -L: Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lung FDA: US Food and Drug Administration 5 GBD: Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors GCP: Good Clinical Practice GOG -Ntx: Gynaecologic Oncology Group -Neurotoxicity GSGDS: General Sleep Disturbance Scale HNA: Holistic Needs Assessment HRA: Health Research Authority Hz: Hertz IES-R: Impact of Event Scale - Revised IHCs: Inner Hair Cells ISO: International Organisation for Standardisation LFS: Lee Fatigue Scale LWBC: Living with and beyond cancer MeSH: Medical Subject Headings MOS: Medical Outcomes Study SF -36 NCI CTCAE: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Even ts NSCLC: Non -small -cell lung carcinoma OHCs: Outer Hair Cells 6 OHFs: Online Health Forums PBC: Platinum based chemotherapy PPI: Patient and Public Involvement PRE: Patient Reported Experience PRISMA: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta -Analysis PROM: Patient reported outcome measures PSS: Perceived Stress Scale PTA: Pure tone audiometry QoL: Life QoL Research and control trials REC: Research Ethics Committees ROS: Reactive oxygen species SCIN: Scale for chemotherapy -induced long -term neurotoxicity SEDA -24: Side Effects of Drugs SF-12: Medical Outcomes Study -Short Form 12 7 SOP: Standard Operating TC Module: Testicular Cancer Modu le TOI: Trial Outcome Index WHO: World Health Organisation YLDs: Years lived with disability 8 Publications, Abstracts and Awards Publications Pearson, S.

Summary of Thesis This thesis explores how platinum based chemotherapy induced hearing loss and tinni- tus can impact an individual's quality of life (QoL) . First, t o understand the impact hear- ing loss and tinnitus has on QoL following chemotherapy, an introduction to the basic physiology of the auditory system must be understood. Secondly, the mode of action on how platinum based chemotherapy damages the inner ear and the symptoms this causes is explained, and how this damage can be measured clinically and what effect this can have psychologically on an individual undergoing cancer treatment. This thesis explores b oth quantitative and qualitative methods to identify the preva- lence, severity and impact on QoL ototoxicity can have on adults LWBC , the structure and rationale of this thesis is displayed below in Figure 1. Figure 1 displays the structure and order of this thesis.

The Auditory System The ear is the sensory organ for hearing and balance. It transforms external sound sig- nals into neuronal stimuli which can then be processed by the brain (Melloui et al. 2020) . The human ear consists of three major components: the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear. In summar y, the outer ear directs sound from the environment to the middle ear, transferring acoustic sound waves to the middle ear (Moneta, Quintanilla -Dieck 2017; Moller 2012; Eytan A 2020) . The middle ear connects the outer ear to the inner ear and is responsible for transforming and matching the impedance of the air -filled outer ear to the fluid -filled inner ear (Pickles 2012) . The inner ear consists of the cochlea which transduces vibration to an impulse and the vestibular labyrinth which is responsible for balance (Eytan A 2020) . The cochlea is responsible for convert- ing soundwaves to neuronal stimuli which results in the percept of hearing (Swartz, Loevner 2009) . 36 Figure 2 displays the diagram of the anatomical, cross -sectional overview of the human ear, drawn by Max Br\u00f6del in 1939 (Van De Water 2012; Br\u00f6del et al. 1946). Soundwaves are directed and conducted to the pinna in the outer ear, through the ear canal to the tymp anic membrane, shown in Figure is a thin membrane that terminates the ear canal and acts as a physical barrier between the outer ear and the middle ear (Paul A. Fuchs 2010; Moller 2012) . The soundwaves vibrate in vibrate the ossicular chain (Moller 2012) . The ossicular chain is comprised of three small bones, suspended by ligaments placed in the middle 37 ear cavity: the malleus, connected to the centre of the tympanic membrane , the incus joins the malleus in the cavity of the middle ear above the tympanic mem- brane and runs backwards where it joins the stapes . The posterior end of the stapes is described as a footplate, this footplate covers an opening to the cochlea - the oval win- dow . Thereby the oss icles form a crucial connection from the tympanic membrane to the cochlea. The role of the ossicles is to concentrate and amplify the vibrations to the inner ear (Paul A. Fuchs 2010; Luxon 2003) . The middle ear, in addition to directing and concentr ating sound to the inner ear, maintains air pressure in the middle cavity. This function is performed by the eustachian tube, which connects the middle ear cavity to the pharynx and thereby equalises the air pressure in the middle ear with the air pres- sure in the external auditory canal (Moller 2012) . The inner ear comprises of the cochlea and the vestibular labyrinth. Though they differ in function, the vestibular apparatus and the cochlea share fluid and blood supply. The vestibular organ is responsible for balanc e (Moller 2012) . This thesis focusses on the cochlea, which separ ates sounds into specific frequencies before they are transduced into a neuronal stimulus through the auditory nerve and completes the process of hear- ing. The cochlea is a snail -shaped bony structure , with two and a half turns, enclosed in the petrous port ion of the temporal bone (Moller 2012; the canals form the bony labyrinth, and the membranous labyrinth is found within the bony labyrinth. The cochlea contains three scala media is separated from the scala vestibuli by 38 Reissner's m embrane, and from the scala tympani by the basilar membrane. These membranes act as physical barriers to maintain the different ionic compositions present in each canal. The basilar membrane varies in width and tension from base to apex , it is narrower and stiff er at the base and wider and less stiff at the apex. It contains auditory fibres that are mapped along the cochlea and resonate at a particular frequency in re- sponse to sound (Swartz, Loevner 2009) . This is known as tonotopic mapping (Gauvin et al. 2018) . For instance, low frequencies are detected at the apex of the cochlea, whereas high frequencies are detected at the basal end of the cochlea, seen in Figure 3 (Yost 2013; Goutman et al. 2015; Kern et al. 2008) . Figure 3 displays a diagram of the u ncoiled cochlea and the location of the differ- ent frequencies (Hz) and where they are detected in the cochlea (Kern et al. 2008) . 39 Furthermore, along the basilar membrane lays the organ of Corti , seen in Figure 4, which is responsible for transforming these vibrations from the basilar membrane into neuronal codes (Moller 2012) . innervated fibres that convey auditory information from the cochlea to the central nervous system (CNS) and effer ent fibres conveying information from the auditory cortex to the inner ear, along the coch- lear branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve (nVIII) (Rask -Andersen et al. 2012b) . The organ of Corti contains these sensory cells and two types of hair cells: outer hair cells (OHCs) and inner hair cells (IHCs). These are s eparated by the tunnel of Corti. Hair cells are unable to directly generate an action potential, and thus communicate through spiral ganglion cells to the CNS (Fettiplace 2017; Sliwinska a highly vascularised epithelial tissue on the lateral wall of the scala media . It is respons ible for the maintenance of the ion composition (high ratio of potassium ions to sodium ions) of the endolymph which surrounds the inner and outer hair cells and producing the endocochlear potential in the scala media (Edamatsu et al. 2018) . The correct ionic composition of endolymph is essential for normal cochlear func tion. Both the outer and inner hair cells rely on entry of potassium ions t o cause de- polarisation . The stria vascularis numerous capillaries the de- posit of metabolites in the scala media, which in turn nourish the IHCs and the OHCs as neither possess a direct bloody supply (M\u00f8ller n.d.) . 40 Figure 4 shows a cross section of the cochlear duct and the organ of Corti. The or- gan of Corti contains the sensory hair cells embedded in assorted supporting cells of distinct shape. Inner hair cells are contacted by afferents (orange) whereas outer hair cells are innervated mainly by efferent fibres (yellow) (Fettiplace 2017) . OHCs typically found organised in three rows along the basilar membrane and inter- act with the motion of the basilar membrane. OHCs are typically a cylindrical shaped cell apical of stereocilia Rask Pickles The tallest stereocilia are embedded within the tectorial membrane and linked to the smaller adjacent stereocilia to form a W or V shape on the cell. OHCs are innervated Type II efferent fibres. These thin, unmyelinated fibres can synapse with multiple OHCs on the same row (Goutman et al. 2015) . OHCs are important for amplify- ing sound -evoked vibrations. 41 Figure 5 displays an an atomical diagram of an inner hair cell (IHC) and an outer hair cell (OHC) (Fettiplace, Nam 2019) . IHCs are commonly described as pear -shaped, shown in Figure 5, arrange d in one single row across the membrane, their stereocilia are arranged into a wide U shape, and are not linked together nor embedded in the tectorial membrane (Rask -Andersen et al. 2012a; M\u00f8ller n.d.; Van De Water 2012) . The cells are known to be heavily responsible for sound transduction. ICHs are typically innervated by 20 -30 Type I afferent fibres, which are usually thick and myelinated. Thus, they are considered the primary afferent sensory cells of hearing, as very few efferent terminals reach the ICH (Rask -Andersen et al. 2012b) . The movement of the basilar membrane as a result of a soundwave entering the cochlea , causes the OHCs to exhibit electromobility (hyperpolarisation and subsequently generates et al. et al. Goutman et al. 2015) . This allows the stereocilia of the IHCs to allow an influx of potassium, and thus generating action potentials to the afferent nerves into 42 the CNS. Th e process concludes the auditory information collected by the ear into stim- uli to form a neural code for hearing (Tate 1994; Goutman et al. 2015) . 1.3. Clinical measurements of hearing Sound has physical characteristics that determine how it is perceived in terms of loud- ness or volume (amplitude) and the pitch (frequency). Loudness, or intensity of a sound , can be quantified using sound pressure level i n deci- bels (dB SPL) (Beynon 1993) . The decibel is a logarithmic unit, it has other uses besides the measurement of sound, but is used here to signify the smallest detectable change in a signal that the average listener can detect (Beynon 1993) . Sound pressure level (SPL) refers to the change in pressure away from the ambient pressure, caused by a sound wav e. A reference sound pressure of 20 \u00b5Pa is used as it is the quietest SPL that a group of normal hearing subjects can typically detect , this translates to 0 dB SPL (Atkinson 1980; Huber et al. 2010; vec, Granqvist 2018) The frequency , measured in hertz (Hz), refers to the 'cycles per second' of a waveform. For example, a soundwave completing its waveform 3 times in 1 second would be meas- ured at 3 Hz . Pitch is the perception of frequency , and i t cannot be measured objectively, though is often used synonymously with frequency (Tan et al. 2016; Shawabkeh et al. 2021) . A healthy human ear has an extremely wide hearing range , in terms of both frequency and loudness . It can perceive sounds from as low as 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (Purves et al. 2001) and as quiet as 0 dB SPL (Sliwinska -Kowalska 2015) . Sounds above 85 dB SPL can lead to permanent damage of the hearing system when exposed to them day to day. 43 Generally, above 85 dB SPL the 'safe' duration limit for exposure to a certain sound de- creases . For example, the British Tinnitus Association's Plug'em campaign uses exam- ples such as the sound of a forklift, a person could safely be exposed to the sound of a forklift truck for up to 4 hours (approximately 88 dB SPL ), but this reduces to just 33 seconds when considering an ambulance siren (approximately 115 dB SPL) (British Tinnitus Association n.d.; Aazh, Moore 2017; Liu et al. 2020) . Clinically, the quantification of hearing acuity is done indirectly, using Pure Tone Audi- ometry (PTA ). PTA is the current gold standard test of audiological examination, and the UK's current national protocol for this is by the British Society of Audiology (BSA n.d.) . PTA allows the determination of hearing threshold levels , measured in dB HL , at specific frequencies dB HL from 'hearing level' . A 'pure a sound composed of a single sinusoid waveform , and therefore has one specific frequency . Hearing threshold levels are plotted on an audiogram, a graph in which the x-axis is frequency (Hz), and the y axis is hearing threshold level (dB HL). The average normal threshold is represented as a horizontal line at 0 dB HL. The degree of hearing loss is denoted by how much the threshold at a particular frequency falls beneath t he normal line. For example, a threshold of 50 dB HL at 1 kHz would mean that that a per- son had a threshold that was 50 dB higher than 'normal' at that frequency. The frequen- cies tested during PTA are those most crucial for the perception of speech, and to a lesser exten t environmental sounds (BSA n.d.) . Thes e standard frequencies are 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 and 8000 Hz, seen in Table 1.B. Hearing thresholds beyond 8000 Hz are not routinely measured in clinic , largely due to calibration and time constraints (Moore et al. 2017) . However, the measurement of extended high frequencies (EHF) (those beyond 8 kHz up to 20kHz ) is possible and has been shown to have important 44 clinical application in the detection of 'hidden' pathol ogies such as ototoxicity , seen in Table 1. A (Mehrparvar et al. 2018) . A B C 45 D Table 1 displays blank examples of pure tone audiometry (PTA) graphs. A: Blank PTA graph including the high frequencies for right and left ear.

Pathology of the ear Hearing allows people to communicate and engage with the surrounding env ironment. However, increased exposure to sounds, psychological stress, ageing and types of medi- cine can all impact the ear and its function. There are many pathologies and disorders associated with the ear, such as hearing loss, hyperacusis, vestibular pro blems and tin- nitus. This project primarily focusses on hearing loss and tinnitus. However, it will touch upon vestibular problems and hyperacusis. Vestibular problems are associated with loss of balance, dizziness, and loss of proprioception. Hyperacusis i s a reduced tol- erance to ordinary environmental sounds and can have a negative psychological impact on an individual (Larem 2021) . These disorders of the ear can subsequently impact a person's ability to engage with the world and have a negative impact on quality of life (QoL). Hearing Loss 46 The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) defines hearing loss as the quietest sound an individual can hear in their better ear, taken as the pure -tone av- erage of audiometric thresholds of 0 .5 kHz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 4 kHz above 20 dB (Lydia M Haile et al. 2021a) . Hearing loss is reported in the GBD and is recognised internation- ally by seven mutually exclusive severity categories, seen in Table 1. B. Hearing loss as- sociated with reduced functional outcomes, such as cognitive decline, is defined as a hearing loss greater than 35 dB (Lydia M Haile et al. 2021a) . According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), an estimate d 1.57 billion people lived with hearing loss around the world in 2019 (WHO 2018; GBD 2015 DALYs and HALE Collaborators 2016; Lydia M Haile et al. 2021a) . This is approximately 20% of the population. Hearing loss has moved from the eleventh to fourth most common c ause of disability within the past seven years (Langguth et al. 2019) . Hearing loss increases with age and c urrently over 25% of adults over 60 years of age are affected by hearing loss. This a ge-related hearing loss is defined as presbycusis and is the most common type of hearing loss. However , hearing impairments can be multifactorial and caused by genet- ics, illnesses such as meningitis and viral infections, types of medicine such as chemo- therapy and antibiotics, exposure to noise and trauma to the head or ear. Where the pri- mary cause of heari ng loss is damage to the inner ear and the sensory organs within it, the hearing loss is considered sensorineural. Any damage to the structures in the middle ear such as the tympanic membrane or the ossicles is defined as a conductive hearing loss (Sooriyamoorthy, Jesus 2021) . This thesis primarily focuses on sensorineural hear- ing loss caused by medical treatment, otherwise known as ototoxicity. 47 Sensorineural hearing loss i s considered one of the major causes of hearing impairment that affects the QoL , as it can have a major impact on the ability to communicate with others (Larem et al. 2021) . This, in turn can impact well -being and cognitive perfor- mance. Unaddressed hearing loss is heavily associated with cognitive decline, as it can impair a person's social engagement with others which subsequently amplifies any ef- fects of cognitive impairment (Johnson et al. 2021) . Hearing loss is a silent disability and can have a detrimental effect on QoL (Fellinger et al. 2007; Adigun 2017) . To lose the ability to hear speech can reduce the cap ability to perceive others, which can subse- quently affect speech and language skills essential for communication (Adigun 2017) . One study found that the hard of hearing were significantly more socially secluded and partook in less social activities than those who were congenitally deaf and those who had normal h earing (Hogan et al. 2015) . However, it is not only communicati on that is affected; health, independence, QoL and mental health issues, such as distress and de- pression, can all be affected from hearing loss (Mener et al . 2013; Heffernan et al. 2016) . Between 1990 and 2019, the global number of years lived with disability (YLDs) associ- ated with a hearing loss increased by 73.6%, from 20 million people to 43.45 million people (Lydia Haile et al. 2021) . YLDs aim to compare the morbidity associated with dif- ferent non -fatal conditions. YLDs are calculated by multiplying the prevalence of a con- dition with its associated disability weight, reflecting the severity of that disease relative to all other health states (Lydia M Haile et al. 2021b) . Age -related hearing loss was the third largest cause of global YLDs in 2019, following lower back pain and migraine. However, hearing loss was ranked the leading cause of sensory disorders and in those over 70 years of age (Lydia M Haile et al. 2021a; GBD 2015 DALYs and HALE Collaborators 2016) . 48 Tinnitus Tinnitus is defined as \" the conscious awareness of a tonal or composite noise for which there is no identifiable corresponding external acoustic source, which becomes Tinnitus Disorder when associa ted with emotional distress, cognitive dysfunction, and/or auto- nomic arousal, leading to behavioural changes and functional disability .\" (D et al. 2021) . Tinnitus describes the auditory component and tinnitus disorder the associated con- scious experience, such as suffering. Tinnitus can be associated with many com orbidi- ties such as sleep disturbance, anxiety, or depression (Phillips et al. 2017) . It is com- mon ly described as ringing, buzzing, clicking, hissing or humming (Phillips et al. 2017) . Tinnitus c an be caused by sounds located within the body that can be heard externally, known as objective tinnitus (Kaltenbach 2011; Baguley et al. 2013) . However, the most common type of tinnitus is subjective tinnitus . There are variations in definitions across the medical and epidemiological literature to describe s ubjective tinnitus. The definition used in this thesis is that subjective tinnitus is a \"phantom sensation where abnormal neural activity is generated with in the auditory nervous system \" (M\u00f8ller 2007; Stower 2020) . Clinically, a person is considered to have tinnitus if the tinnitus lasts more than five minutes and does not on ly arise following noise exposur e (Stower 2020) . It is thought to impact between 10 -15% of the population (Stower 2020) . However, for al- most 1 in 10 of people that experience tinnitus, this can be disabling, and the sound is perceived as an intrusive threat, leading to distress (Langguth et al. 2019; Hymowitz 2016; Basso et al. 2020) . Thus, tinnitus can be separated into two components, the phantom perception of sound and the emotional resp onse to this perception. 49 The aetiology and pathophysiology of tinnitus is not fully understood, despite many ef- forts to progress research in the field. Results from in vivo studies found various under- lying mechanisms affecting the auditory nervous system, however, there has been little success in developing an effective pharmacological treatment for people experiencing tinnitus (McFerran, 2019) . One theory is that tinnitus is a neuroplastic response to s en- sory deprivation and the subsequent neuronal changes associated in the central audi- tory system cause the phantom sounds (Baguley et al. 2013) . Furthermore, temporal synchrony in the neuronal firing pattern of the auditory system can be abnormal, and is another proposed theory for tinnitus occurrence (Baguley et al. 2013) . It has also been suggested that tinnitus may exist when abnormal neuronal activity in the primary sen- sory cortex is connected to a broader cortical network involving frontal, parietal, and limbic brain regions, which has been shown via neuroimaging (Baguley et al. 2013) . Tinnitus is associated with depressive disorders, anxiety, increased stress, cognitive im- pairment and insomnia, all which can negatively impact a person's QoL (Basso et al. 2020; Hymowitz 2016) . Though tinnitus cann ot be cured, there are many treatments available such as mindfulness, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and in some people, the use of hearing aids for management of tinnitus (Fuller et al. 2017) . Ototoxicit y Ototoxicity refers to any type of hearing impairment or tinnitus, resulting from either a temporary or permanent inner ear dysfunction following treatment with an ototoxic drug (Paken e t al. 2016) . Platinum based chemotherapy is an example of an ototoxic drug that can cause permanent damage to the cochlea and vestibular organ. Other ex- amples of ototoxic compounds include aminoglycoside antibiotics and loop diuretics, 50 though this thesi s focuses primarily on platinum based chemotherapy (Baguley, Fagelson 2013) . For this reason, any mention of ototoxicity, unless specified, will repre- sent platinum based chemotherapy induced ototoxicity. Cisplatin, and carboplatin on a lesser scale, can cause damage by entering the stria vas- cularis in the Organ of Corti. As cisplatin is a polar compound, it can enter through cop- per transporter 1 (CTR1) on the membrane (Fennell et al. 2016) . Here , cisplatin accu- mulates within the damage. Cisplatin increases reactive oxygen spe- cies (ROS) by activating the NOX -3 pathway. This, in turn, reduces the antioxidant en- zymes present in the cochlea. The NOX -3 pathway activates the NOX famil y of NADPH oxidases, expressed predominately in the inner ear (Theile, Dirk 2017; Gauvin et al. 2018) . The protein encoded by NOX is involved in the biogenesis of otoconia, bio -crys- tals that are involved in the perception of gravity. When the NOX -3 pathway is activated, it generates superoxides such as ROS and transports electrons across the 2015) . The increased ROS in the inner ear react with nitric oxide, forming per oxynitrite which activates the p53 apoptotic pathway and lead s to BAX activation initiating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Additionally, cisplatin can also form stable covalent bonds with guanine, producing intras trand crosslinks leading to permanent DNA damage (Huang et al. 2015; Paken et al. 2016) . The combina- tion of these mechanisms induces apoptosis and damage within the inner ear, targeting specifically the cochlear hai r cells. This damage primarily impacts OHCs in the basal turn of the cochlea where higher frequency sounds are transduced , causing high -fre- quency hearing loss (Fettiplace, Nam 2019) . 51 Oxaliplatin can damage the cochlea differently, however. Contrary to cisplatin being tran sported through the CTR1 membrane, there is a decreased uptake of oxaliplatin which is thought to be the reason for reduced ototoxicity being reported from oxali- platin treatment (Oun et al. 2018; Theile, Dirk 2017) . Furthermore, oxaliplatin does not appear to cause any direct damage to the cochlear hair cells, unlike cisplatin and car- boplatin, but causes auditory nerve degeneration. Nerve damage is a common adverse effect of oxaliplatin and can manifest as sensory neuropathy, cold exacerbated paraes- thesia and ataxia (Avan et al. 2015) . It can therefore be suggested that it is primarily neurotoxicity impacting the cochlea, which in turn causes ototoxicity. Ototoxicity commonly manifests as hearing loss, tinnitus and vestibular problems (Waissbluth et al. 2017; Travis et al. 2014) . The effects are often permanent and accu- mulative; thus, ototoxicity is typically considered a dose -limiting toxicity. Both hearing loss and tinnitus are associated with an increased risk of depressive disorders, social isolation, dementia, cognitive decline and anxiety disorders (Gurgel et al. 2014; Nordvik et al . 2018) . For this reason, QoL can be majorly impacted by ototoxicity. Hearing loss induced by platinum based chemotherapy manifests initially as a bilateral sensorineural high -frequency hearing loss. The cumulative dose of chemotherapy, or additional o totoxic medication, can progress the hearing loss into the lower speech fre- quencies (Skalleberg et al. 2017; Saladin et al. 2015) . A systematic review researching the restoration of hearing loss found that the average prevalence of hearing loss caused by cisplatin was 60%, however reports range from 12% to 100% (Chirtes, Albu 2016) . When cisplatin was used in conjunction with carboplatin, one study reported that up to 90% of patients experienced ototoxic symptoms (Campbell, Le Prell 2018) . The data on 52 the prevalence, severity and incidence of ototoxicity in cancer patients, however, are highly variable. This is partially due to differences in reporting, grading systems and tools , such as questionnaires, used to measure ototoxicity (Waissbluth et al. 2017) . There are a multitude of different diagnostic and screening assessments for chemo ther- apy-induced ototoxicity. Yet there is no standardised protocol or policy in place . Addi- tionally, many assessments are used for research purposes and not adhered to in prac- tice. It is recommended anyone undergoing cisplatin should have a baseline hearin g test, though this is rarely carried out in clinical settings. Furthermore, clinics may use different scoring systems to assess the severity and type of ototoxicity, potentially overreporting or underreporting the incidence of ototoxicity. One issue with diagnosing ototoxicity is that the type of ototoxicity experience d by the patient is not always de- fined. For example, a person experiencing intrusive tinnitus would not need the same support as someone experiencing hearing loss, yet both people could be di agnosed with the same level of ototoxicity regardless of needing different types of support. Common adult ototoxicity diagnostic tools are commonly patient -reported outcome measure s (PRO Ms), such as questionnaires (Hall et al. 2016; S. et al. 2011) . Currently, there are no ototoxicity -specific qu estionnaires, many chemotherapy side effect ques- tionnaires include elements of ototoxicity in their questions. For example, the scale for chemotherapy -induced long -term neurotoxicity (SCIN) questionnaire includes two questions on ototoxicity: \"Have you suf fered from ringing in your ears?\" and \"Have you suffered from reduced hearing?\". These can be answered \"Not at all, a little, quite a bit and very much\" (Oldenburg, Foss\u00e5, et al. 2006) . A widely used questionnaire used in the UK is the Holistic Needs Assessments ( HNA ) by Macmilla n (Macmillan n.d.) . This is a 53 self-assessment tool used to identify any concerns a patient undergoing treatment may have and lists various side effects. In the event of concern about a specific side effect, the patient selects the appropriate boxes to discuss with their primar y clinician. The HNA includes physical symptoms, practical concerns, emotional symptoms, relationship is- sues, spiritual concerns and concerns about information or support. Widely used, the HNA identifies any problems in hearing in the section \"Sight or hearing\". However, this excludes tinnitus and vestibular issues and does not make it clear that care needed for sight and hearing problems are different and require different specialities. The primary aim of having effective ototoxicity monitoring in those undergoing chemo- therapy treatment is to detect signs of cochlear damage before the patient exp eriences any ototoxic symptoms (ASHA 1994) . By doing this, further significant damage to the inner ear can be potentially prevent ed by reducing or removing the ototoxic drug from the chemotherapy regime. Monitoring this also aims to provide any necessary and ap- propriate audiologic rehabilitation in the cases of unavoidable hearing impairment (Custer 2019) . However, to date, there is no internationally accepted standardised mon- itoring protocol or policy, despite there being many published criteria for ototoxicity detection. The main monitoring programmes are shown in Table 2 and include the American Speech -Language -Hearing Association ( ASHA ), the National Cancer I nstitute's Common Terminology for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Brock and the American Acad- emy of Audiology . A major issue with diagnosing and grading ototoxicity begins with its definition. The American Speech -Language -Hearing Association (ASHA) defines ototoxicity as either >20 dB loss 54 in pure tone threshold in at least one frequency, >10 dB decrease at two adjacent fre- quencies, or loss of responses at three consecutive frequencies where responses were previously obtained (Theunissen et al. 2014) . The criteria focus on detecting false posi- tives, over -diagnosing the detection of hearing loss. Because ASHA grading measures threshold changes from a baseline, clinical impact can be difficult to measure. On the other hand, the World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria bases ototoxicity on the aver- age of the thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz in the better ear. However, this criterion does not include high frequencies (6 kHz , 8 kHz ) reducing the chance of diagnosing hearing loss before it progresses. Furthermore, this criterion describes grade 1 as a slight im- pairment, despite the need for counselling and hearing aids at this level (Crundwell et al. 2016; Waissbluth et al. 2017) . ASHA classes ototoxicity as binary rather than a categorical scale. In the case of a base- line assessment being carried out, the ASHA grading system can detect changes in hear- ing due to ototoxicity rather than a pre -existing hearing loss. However, those who suffer from mild hearing loss are classed in the same group as those suffering from a severe hearing loss and would receive the same support. This would not only be uneconomical but inefficient and a misuse of resources. When diagnosing ototoxicity, clinical trials frequently underestimate the impact of hear- ing loss and tinnitus has on patients and only report grade 3+ (severe hearing loss), de- spite grade 1 having a possible significant effect on social activities, employment and mental health. Furthermore, the varie ty of grading systems were compared and found 55 38% of patients presented with ototoxicity when using the Common Terminology Crite- ria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v3.0), 61% with Brock, 54% with ASHA, and Silverman's approach (Waissbluth et al. 2017) . Grading should be unambiguous and standardised, with audiologists using the same met hods for each patient. However, this is difficult to carry out, with inconsistent availa- bility of facilities, equipment and a lack of national guidelines for high -frequency audi- ometry (Crundwell et al. 2016) . Thus, grading and diagnosing ototoxicity currently pro- vides no widespread, valid and comparable data to predict or assess which support methods are best suited for patients. Instances where ototo xicity monitoring takes place in clinics, physical assessments such as pure tone audiometry hearing tests can be commonly used in addition to PRO Ms. The most common adult grading tools are seen in Table 2 below (King, Bre wer 2018; Crundwell et al. 2016; Kornak 1994) mentation of these monitoring systems and ototoxicity grading tools vary between countries and individual clinicians. There is no standardised or gold standard mo nitor- ing system currently used worldwide. 56 Population Purpose Classification Parameters ASHA Individuals re- ceiving cochleo- toxic drug therapy Identify Cochleotoxicity from serial audiometry Binary yes/no based -on changes from baseline. 10 dB change from baseline at 2 consecutive frequencies, or, 20 dB change at 1 -frequency, or loss of response where one was previously obtained.

Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cost -efficient systematic treatment used to reduce and eliminate a multitude of solid tumours including lung, breast, ovaria n, testicular and head and neck cancers (Bielefeld et al. 2021; Brown et al. 2013; Lairson et al. 2014) . The cytotoxic prop erties of platinum were discovered serendipitously but was soon found to be one of the most effective and versatile anti -cancer therapies (Dasari, Bernard Tchounwou 2014) . Cisplatin was first licensed in 1971 and has since resulted in the increase of can- cer survival rates (Kelland 2007) . In fact, platinum based chemotherapy continues to be one of the most efficient anti -cancer therapies, used to treat a variety of cancers in both adults and children (Paken et al. 2016) . Platinu m based chemotherapy has been devel- oped to improve safety and delivery, it remains ototoxic. In addition to ototoxicity, other dose -limiting effects of cisplat in includes nephrotoxi- city, for carboplatin it is myelosuppression and oxaliplatin is heavily associated with neurotoxicity. However, common side effects include anaphylaxis, neutropenia, anorexia, cachexia, and asthenia (Oun et al. 2018) . However, many of these are temporary and can be treated pharmacologically. Ototoxicity cannot be pharmacologically cured and can only be managed and monitored (Macmillan n.d.) . For this reason, it is important to monitor people's hearing when being treated with ototoxic drugs. 59 Further complicating the issue of cisplatin ototoxicity, it is unclear when the window for ototoxic injury closes following treatment. A high -frequency threshold shift and reduc- tions in word recognition ability have been documented in children, years following cis- platin. However, no such data are reported in adults (Bielefeld et al. 2021; Einarsson et al. 2010; Bertolini et al. 2004) Cisplatin Michele Peyrone firs t described the compound which was to become cisplatin in the 1840s (Edamatsu et al. 2018) . However, it was not until 1965 that Barnett Rosenberg and his group discovered that platinum could inhibi t binary fission in the Escherichia coli bacteria (Rosenberg et al. 1967) . An accidental discovery, they found that it was the platinum that reduced the number of cells growing in the media and thus the cytotoxic properties of platinum were discovered (Oun et al. 2018) . Rosenberg and his group concluded that compounds capable of inhibiting E. Coli divi- sion could also be useful for treat ing cancer. At first, they developed cisplatin to treat sarcoma and leukaemia in rodents. Further in vivo tests in 1968 showed cisplatin caused tumour regression, which led to the first patient being treated in 1971 with the drug being approved by the US F ood and Drug Administration (FDA) a short while after, in 1978 (Kelland 2007) . Cisplatin induces cellular apoptosis in DNA. Cispl atin binds to purine residues and as such can cause DNA damage in malignant cells, blocking any cell division and inducing apoptosis (Gersten et al. 2020) . Similar to the effect cisplatin has on the inner ear, it can also induce excessive ROS on cancer cells. This induction of ROS can then induce apoptosis through both extrinsic and 60 intrinsic pathways , and in the event of excessive ROS levels, cisplatin can induce necro- sis in cancer cells and autophagy (Dasari, Bernard Tchounwou 2014) . Cisplatin is used as a first line chemotherapy in the treatment of non -small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as the standard adjuvant treatment following surgery. It is also used to treat ovarian cancer, although as recurre nce occurs in up to 75% of ovarian cancer pa- tients and tumours often develop resistance to cisplatin, other methods of treatment must be considered long -term . It is also used to treat testicular cancer. However, cur- rent treatment methods include combinatio ns of various chemotherapies to increase survival rates. Common combinations of cisplatin treatment include other chemotherapies such as paclitaxel, 5 -FU, doxorubicin and others, shown in Table 3 (Dasari, Bernard Tchounwou 2014) . Some of these chemotherapy regim ens, such as cisplatin and paclitaxel are known to neurotoxic Combination Drug(s) with Cisplatin Cancer Type Paclitaxel Ovarian carcinoma Breast carcinoma Lung carcinoma Melanoma Head and neck carcinoma Paclitaxel and 5 -FU Gastric and Esophagogastric adenocarcinoma UFT Non -small lung carcinoma Osthole Lung cancer Honeybee venom Ovarian cancer 61 Anvirzel Breast, Colon, Lung, Prostate, Melanoma and Pancreatic cancer Bevacizumab Non -small lung carcinoma Methotrexate and bleomycin Advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the male tract Metformin Lung adenocarcinoma Oxaliplatin, quercetin and thy- moquinone Ovarian cancer Vindesine Non small lung carcinoma Table 3 displays the common chemotherapy regimens involving cisplatin and which cancer they are typically used to treat. Carboplatin The dose -limiting toxicities associated with cisplatin led to further research into devel- oping safer platinum -based chemotherapeutic agents. This resulted in the developme nt of carboplatin in 1989 (Lanvers -Kaminsky . The ligands cisplatin were a dicarboxycyclobutane ring, modifying the tissue tion . is typically used to treat breast cancer, metastatic lung cancer and ovarian cancer (Windebank, Grisold 2008; Go, Adjei 1999) . It is thought that carboplatin has a reduced risk of causing ototoxicity, however it is also considered to be less effective in treating cancer (Campbell, Le Prell 2018) . In high doses however, carboplatin does carry the same neurotoxic risk as cisplatin (Windebank, Grisold 2008) . In fact, a study 62 found carboplatin was responsible for 20% of patients developing neuropathy and oto- toxicity, reported on scale of chemotherapy Grisold 2008; Langer et al. 2013) . Oxaliplatin The continual pharmaceutical progression of platinum -based compounds and the un- derstanding of tumour resistance to drugs led to the development of oxaliplatin . Oxali- platin was first approved in Europe in 1994 and then in the United States in 2004 as a first -line treatment for metastatic colon cancer, in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin (Windebank, Grisold 2008; Kelland 2007) . It can to treat pan- creatic cancer, upper gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary cancer (Oh et al. 2000) . Oxali- platin is thought to be significantly less ototoxic (Lanvers -Kaminsky et al. 2017) . Clinically, the literature reports few cases of ototoxicity associated with oxaliplatin. For example, a female patient with pancreatic cancer who had previous moderate hearing loss which, following treatment with oxa liplatin progressed to profound hearing loss (Oh et al. 2000) . Patients with profound hearing loss expe rience severe difficulty hear- ing speech even with the aid of amplification devices, such as hearing aids. Another fe- male patient was diagnosed with stage IIIC adenocarcinoma of the colon and was treated with adjuvant oxaliplatin. The patient then proceeded to experience tinnitus and vertigo, following the second cycle (Vietor, George n.d.) . Moreover, a patient with colon cancer treated with oxaliplatin had severe left -sided sensorineural hearing loss. Follow- ing the third cycle, the patient experienced tinnitus and hearing loss in her rig ht ear (G\u00fcven\u00e7 et al. 2016) . Audiometry was performed and indicated a right -sided severe hearing loss. There was no improvement and in fact, the patient refused any further 63 chemotherapy treatment, illustrating starkly how detrimental hearing loss can be for patients (G\u00fcven\u00e7 et al. 2016) . On the contrary, a study including 18 patients found that oxaliplatin induced minimal ototoxicity and therefore would not recommend audio- metric surveillance (Y\u00fcce et al. 2014) . It would be difficult to predict the ototoxic risk however, with only 18 patients. 1.6. Cancer Cancer is defined as the uncontrollable replication of cells caused by genetic and envi- ronmental factors which result in a mutation in cellular DNA. Cancer typically impacts around 2.5 million people in the UK and around 50% of adults receiving treatment h ave a 10-year survival rate (Le Boutillier et al. 2019) . The development of screening pro- grammes, improved diagnostics and the pharmaceutical progression of treatment have contr ibuted to the increasing survival rates. However, due to the COVID -19 pandemic and the UK national lockdown , cancer screening has been, for the most part, delayed or suspended. For example, referrals through the usual urgent pathway have decreased by 84% (Sud et al. 2020) . This has had a major impact on diagnostic delays and treatment delays for those LWBC (Maringe et al. 2020) . Prior to the pandemic between 2013 - 2014, 28% of people diagnosed with cancer received curative or palliative chemother- apy. 1.7. Living with and beyon d cancer An individual who has recovered from a cancer diagnosis was previously defined as be- ing a \"cancer survivor\" (Mayer et al. 2017) . However, experiencing cancer is not a li near process and it has been argued that someone with cancer may not fit into a \"cancer pa- tient\" or \"cancer survivor\" rhetoric (Ganesan et al. 2018) . Thus, the term \"living with 64 and beyond can cer\" (LWBC) was developed (Khan et al. 2012) . Living with a current di- agnosis or history of cancer is an individual and unique experience for everyone. Due to the long -term physical and psychological impact cancer and its treatment can have, many argue there is no such thing as \"surviving cancer\". A n interview -based qualitative study concluded that the majority of participants did not endorse the term \"cancer sur- vivor\", and those that accepted the term understood survivorship as having had cancer and survived with no recurrence. Most people rejected the term as it implied they were \"cured\" despite a high risk of recurrence and long -term side effects they experience (Le Boutillier et al. 2019) . For this reason, this thesis w ill use the term \"living with and be- yond cancer\" where possible to describe this population (KHAN et al. 2012) . For exam- ple, LWBC is more inclusive for people with stable but incurable cancer, are in remis- sion but at high -risk o f relapse or experience long term physical and psychological ef- fects from treatment (Mayer et al. 2017) . The Global Burden of Disease Study reported the percentage of people living with disa- bility directly caused by cancer treatment had increased from 9.3% to 14.2% in 2015 (GBD 2015 DALYs and HALE Collaborators 2016) . Increasing survival rates of cancer should remain an im portant objective of treatment, there is an urgent need to reduce both acute and long -term toxicities. A deeper understanding of the impact of these long term and late effects that cancer treatments have on QoL can improve clinical research and most importantly, help towards the development of better personalised care for the 14.2% of patients living with a debilitating effect of cancer treatment (GBD 2015 DALYs and HALE Collaborators 2016) . 65 WHO defines QoL as an \"individual's perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expecta- tions, standards and concerns. It is a broad ranging concept affected in a complex way by the person's physical health, psyc hological state, personal beliefs, social relationships and their relationship to salient features of their environment\" (Post 2014; Chabowski et al. 2017; Organization 2014) A late effect is a term used for a side effect which appears, or develops, at a noticeable level once treatment has ended. For example, hearing loss may not be noticeable until 6 months following the first cycle of chemotherapy. This may be because other side ef- fects which are more acute and life-threatening take priority, and it is only when these subside that these slowly progressing toxicities impact QoL . For instance, when under- going treatment in a hospital ward, where it may not be detrimental to your daily life to hear every sound, patients may not even notice a hearing loss, o r tinnitus may be put down to stress or be deemed temporarily. Often, ototoxicity only becomes apparent once the individual engages in everyday activities. Whilst undergoing cancer treatment, the chance of survival and the acute adverse ef- fects may take priority, for example cardiotoxicity, neutropenic sepsis, or hepatotoxi- city, which are potentially life -threatening and induce clinical emergencies (Morgan et al. 2011) . It is when these temporary side effects subside, and the cancer is in remission that long -term and late toxicities progress and become increasingly important (Skalleberg et al. 2017) . Survivors are then left with often permanent and possible life - debilitating effects from treatment. These toxic effects can occ ur during treatment and persist, or begin months after treatment has finished, hence the term \"late effects\" (Pavy 66 et al. 1995) . It may not be possible to identify the exact point at which a late effect first appears, which may be grad ual or insidious, making it challenging to truly determine the causality and risk of each therapy received (Stein et al. 2008) . In a recent study many breast cancer survivors stated that they felt ill -prepared for certain late effects and the emotional issues associated with them (Matthews, Semper 2017) . To date, there the research and knowledge on late effects is variable . For example, it is known that platinum based chemotherapy can cause hearing loss and tinnitus (Campbell, Le Prell 2018) . Though, t he effect on QoL and how adults LWBC react to and manage ototoxic late effects remains unclear. However, information surrounding late e ffects such as car- diotoxicity is increasing . Cardiotoxicity is a common long -term effect of many chemo- therapies, and currently can be treated and managed by exercise rehabilitation and an- thracyclines (Avila et al. 2019; D\u00edaz -Balboa et meta -review written by Laidsaar -Powell et al., identified 60 qualitative systematic re- views to identify the strengths and evidence gaps in survivorship research (Laidsaar - Powell et al>, 2019) . The review deduced that the current strengths in this area include QoL and return to work, particularly in female and young cancer survivors. However, gaps in the evidence -base included late effects and psychological issues. The r eview concluded that this was surprising, given that there is an increasing number of people surviving cancer who experience significant side effects from treatment (Laidsaar - Powell et al>, 2019) . Furthermore, in 2019 the James Lind Alliance founded the 10 ques- tions on LWBC, many of these focussed on awareness and management of long -term ef- fects of treatment in order to prioritise research in this area (James Lind Alliance n.d.) . 67 Those aged over 65 are respon sible for over half of the cancer diagnoses made, hence cancer is thought to be an age -related disease (Weiss Wiesel et al. 2015) . Increasing a ge is also a risk factor for ototoxicity, along with cumulative dose of platinum, increased noise exposure and genetics (Karasawa, Steyger 2015; Talach et al. 2016) . Hearing defi- cits are also associated with ageing and therefore hearing deficits in cancer survivors are likely to be ignored (Holmes, Padgham 2008) . The reduced QoL from cancer and its associated treatment alone can be detrimental to those affected. The addition of hearing loss and the subsequent impact on the ability to communicate can exacerbate these is- sues. For this reason, there is a need to broaden research beyond survival rates and address the need for support for those who are adapting to a life after cancer. 1.8. Aims and Objectives This PhD thesis aim s to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the issues surround- ing chemotherapy -induced ototoxicity in adults and how this can impact QoL . Objectives of this thesis are to: Identify the prevalence of long -term hearing loss and tinnitus in adults LWBC treated with platinum based chemotherapy . Identify the level of awareness adults LWBC have of ototoxicity prior to recei ving platinum based chemotherapy . Identify the level of awareness clinicians have of ototoxicity prior to offering platinum based chemotherapy . Compare the QoL of those with and without ototoxicity in those receiving plati- num base d chemotherapy . 68 Compare the severity of hearing loss and t innitus in those receiving platinum based chemotherapy to the general population . Identify the key aspects of QoL that are impacted by ototoxicity . Identify the support received by those who have experienced chemotherapy -in- duced ototoxicity. 69 Cancer survivors treated with platinum based chemotherapy af- fected by ototoxicity and the impact on quality of life: a narrative systematic re- view. 2.1. Introduction Identifying the onset of chemotherapy -induced ototoxicity can be challenging, due to the gradual nature of hearing loss progression, lack of awareness and lack of regular monitoring, either by audiometry or self -report. It can, therefore, be difficult to deter- mine the incidence, risk factors and causalities of different treatment o ptions and their long -term effects (Stein et al. 2008) . These factors contribute to the reports on adverse health effects associated with chemotherapy lacking detail, reliability, and accuracy. Systematic reviews are considered the gold standard of evidence -based medicine that aim \"to collect all empirical evidence fitting into a pre -specified eligibility criteria in or- der to answer a specific research question \" (Martinic et al. 2019) . In other words, sys- tematic reviews aim to collate and critically analyse evidence to unbiasedly answer a specific research question. Th ese can then drive forward medical advances, discover gaps in the literature and obtain reliable evidence on the benefits and risks of medical interventions (Moher et al. 2009; Murad et al. 2014) . Systematic reviews have become the gold standard to assess the strength of current evidence and have increased in num- bers, from a single publication between the years 1966 to 1970, to 2467 publications in 1996 to 2000 (Ernst, Pittler 2001) . Though, many confounding factors exist , such as publication rates generally increasing overall. Historically, systematic reviews focused on the effectiveness of an intervention, however, are now used to answer many other 70 research questions. There has been a lack of systematic revi ews into side effects, com- paring the risks vs benefits associated with interventions (M\u00f8ller et al. 2018) . For exam- ple, 27% of the reviews published between 1996 and 2000 included information about safety, and 4% focused primarily on the safety of the intervention reviewed (Mcintosh et al. 2004) . This may be of no surprise, as randomised control trials (RCTs) often pub- lish little detail about side effects, specifically those that are not life -threatening. Fur- thermore, studies which include detailed analyses of side effects, such as observational studies, are seldom included in systematic reviews as they have a higher risk of certain biases such as selection bias and there is a less developed quality appraisal protocol to critically analyse them. Only 1.25% of 3604 publications cited in the 2001 edition of Side Effects of Drugs (SEDA -24) were systematic reviews (Mcintosh et al. 2004; Anderson, Jayaratne 2015) . Systematic reviews aim to meticulously search, analyse and critically appraise current literature according to pre -defined search terms and eligibility criteria (Uman 2011; Jahan et al. 2016) . They aim to answer a specific research question by summarising all the key publications and are therefore a highly unbiased source of evidence (Jahan et al. 2016) . However, the use of inadequate search terms and eligibility criteria can exclude key literature, resulting in skewed evidence and increase bias. Thus, systematic review protocols must be followed to avoid these bias es. A narrative systematic review incor- porates the same methods as a systematic review; however, the results are reported by taking a narrative form and summarising key points , rather than using a meta -analysis as a synthesis . 71 Specific toxicities are rarely included in key words, titles, or abstracts in RCTs . Thus, collating systematic evidence on adverse effects can be difficult. The inconsistent termi- nology and lack of reporting of ototoxicity add to this difficulty. To carry out a good quality systematic review, a balance between sensitivity and precision must be made when deciding on the search terms. Sensitivity in a search is defined as the proportion of systematic reviews for that topic that are retrieved . Precision is defined as how many records need to be reviewed before one finds a relevant record or hit (Montori et al. 2005) . For example, one systematic review found that articles achieving 97% -100% sensitivity had only between 0.9% and 2.8% precision (Golder, Loke 2009) . This meant that between 36 and 125 artic les must be screened to find one relevant article. Due to time and resource constraints, this is unmanageable for most researchers (Golder, Loke 2009; Golder, Loke 2010) . There are no standardised methodologies on how to carry out a systematic review on side effects; the methods and guidelines on how to obtain in- formation on adverse effec ts is sparse (Golder, Loke 2010) . It is challenging, therefore, to generate guidelines to retrieve information on adverse effects (Golder et al. 2019) . Due to the inconsistencies in reporting ototoxicity, there is a heightened risk of evidence selection bias and publication bias when systematically ana lysing data (Higgins et al. 2019; Peryer et al. 2019) . Thus, it is essential that a deeper understanding and in- creased awaren ess of how hearing loss and tinnitus affects the QoL of cancer survivors be established by evaluating the current literature, to improve long -term symptom management and support offered. Though systematic reviews are the gold -standard of evidence -based me dicine and aim to colle ct all information that meets specific pre -defined eligibility criteria, there can be many limitations associated with them. For example, they are subject to many different 72 types of bias, such as selection bias, publication bias and confirmation bias (B\u00f6lte 2014) . Furthermore, key information can be missed depending on the eligibility criteria used, which can be harmful and misleading. To date, there have been no systematic reviews carried out exploring the impact on QoL from platinum based chemotherapy -induced ototoxicity. In order to explore and understand the field of chemotherapy -based ototox- icity for the benefit of those experiencin g it, this information is vital. 2.2. Materials and Methods Information Sources This systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Sys- tematic Reviews and Meta -Analysis (PRISMA) checklist. Various search strategies were trialled prior to finalising the search used in the review. Due to the nature of this s ys- tematic review and the universal difficultly searching adverse effects, specificity and precision were optimised, with advice given from the University of Nottingham Library Service, to capture the most relevant articles without exhausting resources . The four topics that had to be present to be included in the review were: any mention of cancer, platinum based chemotherapy , ototoxicity and QoL. Boo lean operators were used to op- timise sensitivity of the search. Boolean operators are simple words (AND, OR, NOT or AND NOT) used as conjunctions to combine or exclude keywords in a search, resulting in more focused and productive results. The terms, seen in Table 4, outlines the original search strategy for this systematic review. However, these search terms displayed no results. The search strategy was then broadened, and the final strategy is seen in Table 5. Search terms were edited accordingly to meet the standards of each search engine. 73 Table 4 displays the original search strategy used to answer the research ques- tion : How does chemotherapy -induce d ototoxicity impact quality of life in adults living with and beyond cancer? Known key articles were checked in the searches to ensure all relevant articles were in- cluded in the search. There was no limitation on the date range of this search. Search Stra tegy #1 ((Chemotherapy$ OR cisplatin OR #2 AND #3 AND #4 Table 5 displays the final search strategy used in this systematic review Database search es consisted of frequently used medical and scientific dat abases Med- line, Pyschinfo and PyschArticles, Embase, PubMed, WebofScience Core Collection and Search Strategy #1 (Cancer OR carcinogen OR carcinoma* OR malignanc* OR metasta* OR sarcoma* OR OR OR OR \"delayed ef- \"Long Term Cancer Survivor*\") 74 the Cochrane Database. These searches were carried out between 27/02/2018 and 07/03/2018. Search alerts were made for all search engines should any relevant arti- cles be published after this date. Furthermore, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH ) terms were used to capture articles the search terms may exclude. MeSH terms are a vocabulary produced by the National Li- brary of Medicine. It is used for indexing, cataloguing, and searching of biomedical and health -related information. MeSH includes the subject headings appearing in MED- LINE/PubMed, the NLM Catalog, and other databases (National Library of Medicine 2021) . Carboplatin Oxaliplatin Cancer survivors Quality of Life Quality -Adjusted Life Years Eligibility Criteria The inclusion criteria consisted of: Any combination of treatments which in cluded platinum based chemotherapy A type of formal QoL assessment (such as SF -36 or EORTC QLC -C30 question- naires) 75 Any type of formal hearing loss and/or tinnitus assessment, Written in the English language, Any study design providing the relevant result s were obtained after treatment Exclusion criteria consisted of: Head and neck cancer Paediatric (18 or below) studies was excluded, Review articles Grey literature in vitro and in vivo studies Study Selection The results from each database were collated into Endnote and duplicates were re- moved. The remaining titles and abstracts were screened by two independent research- ers (SP and JT) against the eligibility criteria. Any disagreement was resolved by con- sensus. Full -text articles of potentially relevant papers were also assessed for eligibility by the two independent researchers, once again resolving any discrepancies by consen- sus. The final articles to be included in the systematic review were agreed upon by the two independent researchers. Data Extract ion Process The articles which were to be included in the systematic review were then prepared for data extraction. Determinants such as paper characteristics, type of study design, sam- ple size, patient demographics, control type, sample size, type of cancer, type of chemo-76 therapy and the measurements used and analysed, in addition to the results of the spe- cific study were all extracted. Furthermore, a small summary of each of the papers were also included in the data extraction. The data obtained from e ach of the included papers were extracted manually onto a Microsoft Excel document. This process detected that the data were heterogenous and inconsistent and as a result could not be quantitatively compared. Therefore, a more in -depth data extraction was completed and any available data within each of the papers were extracted, regardless of if it could be compared. The information which could be compared across studies was then analysed accordingly, with the remaining information displayed as a narrative synthesis to represent the full results. Risk of Bias in Individual Studies A quality assessment was carried out on each of the studies included in this review us- ing a 14 -item study quality assessment tool involving pre -defined principles, the NIH's Qual ity Assessment Tools (National Heart Lung and Blood Institute 2013) . An item was scored 1 for matching the criterion an d scored 0 if it was not clear or did not match the criterion. Aggregate percentages were used to classify poor -quality (50%), and high - quality (>50%) studies. This tool was chosen based on a systematic review carried out by Mols, et al. (Mols et al. 2005) that assesses relevant aspects for each study type. The high -quality studies were compared against the low -quality studies to evaluate system- atic consistencies and anomalies. Summary Measures 77 The prevalence, incidence, and severity of ototoxicity and QoL were the key measure- ments sought for in this review. This included a formal assessment in QoL and ototoxi- city. Due to the variability of outcomes measures involved in QoL assessments and hear- ing loss and tinnitus assessments, statistical effects could not feasibly be predicted or measured. Synthesis of Results Due to the heterogeneity of the results reported in this review, it was not possible to statistically combine and compare the results. A narrative analysis was carried out, and the descriptive result s of each study were compared with one another. Outcome measures from the studies were extracted and compared, including the diag- nostic criteria and grading systems used. Risk of Bias Across Studies Most of the adverse effects within the studies were not clearly defined, thus the risk of bias between studies was relatively high. For example, some studies only reported ad- verse effects of grade 3 or above on the NCI CTCAE scale . With regards to ototoxicity, this meant that only the events in which patients had a hearing loss that limited daily activities and require hearing aids were reported in the study. Moreover, not all diag- nostic criteria were specified, meaning some studies measured ototoxicity using a bi- nary outcome and did not clarify its severity or symptom characteristics, i.e., whether it was hearing loss or tinnitus. The non -randomised studies were also considered to carry a high risk of bias, as trials without blinding are prone to bias (Loke et al. 2007) . 2.3. Resu lts Study Selection 78 A total of 645 articles were identified through the database searches performed. From this, 337 articles were excluded due to duplications, grey literature (not peer reviewed journal articles) and there being no abstracts available. The resulting 308 titles and ab- stracts were screened. The screening proce ss is seen in Figure 6. 79 Figure 6 displays the PRISMA flowc hart Methods and results obtained for this sys- tematic review. Study Characteristics 80 The following study characteristics were extracted: type of study design, authors, loca- tion of study, type of cancer, number of participants and number of participants tre ated with platinum based chemotherapy , diagnostic measurements for ototoxicity, hearing loss, tinnitus and QoL, type of platinum based chemotherapy , follow -up period, main ob- jective of study and a descriptive summary of the study , shown in Table 6 . 81 Type of Study Author (year) Location Cancer Type Total number of partici- pants in study Number of participants re- ceiving PBC Cross -sectional Bentzen (2013) Norway Squamous cell carcinoma of anal region 128 56 Bokemeyer (1996) Germany Testicular cancer 90 90 Calhoun (1998) USA Advanced -stage ovarian cancer 15 15 Miaskowski (2018) USA Various 623 404 USA Various 623 371 USA Various 623 85 RCT Bezjak (2008) Canada Early -stage NSCLC Month 0: 482 Month 36: 89 Month 0: 242 Month 36: 50 Saad (2017) Egypt Stage IV NSCLC 71 36 cisplatin 35 carboplatin Longitudinal Fossa (2003) Netherlands, Rot- terdam, UK, Bel- gium Metastatic testicular (1996) testicular cancer 103 45 Norway/UK Low -stage testicular cancer 206 26 Table 6 displays the study characteristics extracted for this review, including type of study, authors, location of study, cancer type, number of total participants in study and number of participants receiving PBC. PBC: platinum based chemotherap y.82 In total, 6 cross -sectional studies were included in the systematic review, shown in Ta- ble 6. In total, this included 856 participants, 565 of which received platinum based chemotherapy (Bentzen et al. 2013; Bokemeyer et al. 1996; Calhoun et Mastick, Schumacher, Mastick, Abrams, et al. 2018; Miaskowski, Mastick, et al. 2018) . The two randomised control trials in- cluded in the study compared cisplatin -based regimens with other types of treatments and includ ed a total of 553 patients, with 313 of these having a platinum -based treat- ment (Bezjak et al. 2008; Saad et al. 2017) . Onl y one longitudinal study was included in this systematic review, which followed 666 patients with metastatic testicular cancer on two different cisplatin regimens, with 286 (52%) being followed up at 2 years (Foss\u00e5 et al. 2003) . Finally, one paper involved two separate pilot studies on low -stage testic ular cancer survivors from Norway and the UK (Fossa, Fossg 1996) . This study involved comparing opinions on toxicities of those treated with infradiaphragmatic radiotherapy, cisplatin, or surveillance and the opinions of a variety of healthcare professionals. Of the 309 participants involv ed, 71 of these received cisplatin. 83 Author (year) Patient characteristics Age at diagnosis Time since diagnosis Control/comparison group Cross -sectional Bentzen (2013) Patients diagnosed with cancer between 2000 -2007 with cura- tive intent.

Only one study investigated the difference between carboplatin and cisplatin (Saad et al. 2017) . Moreover, only one study compared the toxicities with those treated with cisplatin to the people without cancer (Bentzen et al. 2013) . Risk of Bias The NIH Quality Assessment Tool was used to assess each of the individual studies (NHLBI, International n.d.) . The appraisal criteria involved answering 14 binary ques- tions on the quality of the article. The NIH Quality Assessment tool was developed by methodologists from NHLBI and Res earch Triangle Institute International. These tools are based on quality assessment methods, concepts, and other tools developed by re- searchers in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence -Based Practice Centres, the Cochrane Collabora tion, the USPSTF, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, and the National Health Service Centre for Reviews and Dissemina- tion, as well as consulting epidemiologists and others working in evidence -based medi- cine, with adaptations by methodologists and NHLBI staff for this project. The NIH Qual- ity Assessment Tools were designed to assist reviewers in evaluating topics that are key to carry out a critical appraisal of the internal validity of a study. The tools included questions to identify potentia l flaws in a study, such as evaluating sources of bias, confounders, and statistical power. A question could be answered by re- sponding \"yes\", \"no\" or \"cannot determine/not reported/not \"cannot determine /not reported/not applicable\" were con- sidered as potential flaws. Guidance to complete these assessment tools, specific to each type of study, was also developed by the methods team and NHLBI. In some cases, ex- amples were provided for additional clarity. A numerical score was calculated between the two independent researchers (SP and JT). High -quality studies are typically associ- ated with less risk of bias than a poor -quality study. Thus, poor quality studies should be interpreted with caution. Table 9 displays the NIH quality assessment score for each assessment, the percentage and quality of each study included in this systematic review. Note tha t some papers rep- resent more than one study . Those with a score of >50% (n=7) were classed as a high - quality study, and those 50% (n=4) were classed as a poor -quality study. The studies were grouped according to quality to compare any differences in results and identify any contradicting informatio n.

The papers with a quality score 50% (n=4) all compared opinions of patients a nd healthcare professionals. The papers concluded that most patients perceived the effects of ototoxicity as tolerable, whereas those in health professions perceived the toxicity to negatively affect QoL. However, these studies were all based on hypothetic al scenarios, such as rating possible side effects by participants not experiencing them , therefore it could be hypothesised that patients may not realise the extent to which QoL can change when experiencing ototoxicity, compared to professionals. All but one study scoring >50% concluded that QoL is indeed affected by tinnitus and/or hearing loss, adding that severity correlated with the dosage and number of cycles. However, one high quality study carried out by Bezjack, et.al. 2008 found no difference in t he QoL assessed across different treatments, regardless of experiencing ototoxicity. Yet, this study found that ototoxicity did indeed persist beyond treatment (Bezjak et al. 2008) . There were no sig- nificant differences in overall conclusions from the high -quality studies compared to the lower quality studies. Results of the Individual Studies The data extracted in Table 10 demonstrate that there are no standardised outcome measures used to assess ototoxicity. For example, many of the outcome measures used identified the presence of ototoxicity yet failed to defi ne or specify the type of ototoxi- city evaluated. These studies could have measured the presence of hearing loss, tinnitus, or vestibular issues.89 Author Aim of study Outcome measures Results Hearing Loss Tinnitus Ototoxicity Quality of Life Other Bentzen (2013) To compare the long -term QoL of cancer pa- tients com- pared to the QoL of the population.

Tinnitus was defined as \"ringing or buzzing in the ears\" (Miaskowski, Paul, Mastick, 2018; Miaskowski, Paul, Mastick, Abrams, et al. 2018) . The studies compared those with hearing loss, tinnitus and neuropathy to those with just one of the toxicities and those with no toxicities. However, these studies do not report which platinum based chemotherapy was used, the regimen used, the dosage or how many cycles each patient received. 2.4. Discussion The overall results found that tho se treated with platinum based chemotherapy , specifi- cally cisplatin, had higher reports of hearing loss than the comparison population used in the studies, with increased doses positively correlating to persisting symptoms. Tin- nitus has also been reported in previous studies, particularly those with high doses of cisplatin (Campbell, Le Prell 2018) . These results corroborate with the wider literature, as it is reported that on average, 60 -70% of adult patients experienced ototoxicity when treated 2016; Travis et al. 2014) . This narrative systematic review found that those with tinnitus and hearing loss were more likely to have a lower QoL. Furthermore, many studies did not consider the severity or grading of ototoxicity. One study did, however, perform pure tone audiometry with bone conduction thresholds on patients to assess the extent of their hearing loss (Bokemeyer et al. 1998) . By using bi- nary outcome measures, the severity of ototoxicity cannot accurately be assessed. Per-96 sonalised treatment options and referral pathw ays may not be appropriate to the pa- tients' needs, creating a situation where some patients are not receiving adequate care, and others may receive care where they may not need it. Although those receiving platinum bas ed chemotherapy who experienced an ot otoxic symptom reported a lower QoL, due to the heterogeneity of results it was not possible to identify a direct correlation between the two factors. For example, adults receiving the first three cycles of platinum based chemotherapy commonly report a red uction in QoL (Kalyanam et al. 2018) . As discussed previously , it is well documented that hearing loss negatively impacts mental wellbeing and QoL (Adigun 2017) . However, early diag- nosis and treatment of hearing aids appear to improve general QoL within the first year, emphasising the importance of early detection of ototoxicity (Hogan et al. 2015; Fellinger et al. 2007) . Tinnitus has also been shown to be a significant burden on QoL and has a strong association with depression in the general population (Zeman et al. 2014; Nondahl et al. 2007) . The evidence suggests that ototoxicity in cancer survivors is correlated with a reduced QoL . However, due to the heterogeneity of the study designs and the lack of research carried out in this field, it cannot be categorically stated that this is true. The studies included in this review were highly variable in both their methods and re- sults. T he results clearly highlight the lack of standardisation in reporting QoL and oto- toxicity diagnostics. Furthermore, the lack of grading means that individuals could be suffering from ototoxic effects and it is not reported adequately in study settings, or the opposite, where the reporting overestimates the ototoxic effect. Therefore, it is difficult 97 to assess the strength of the results as a whole, as the nature of this field is heterogene- ous. The lack of standardised diagnostic and grading systems is a significant weakness in the reviewed studies. By pooling together similar data and carrying out a meta -analy- sis, powerful information could be identified and published, which in turn will help in- form and develop better care and management for those experienci ng ototoxicity. This research has typically consisted of a multitude of small -scale studies looking into differ- ent factors, making it impossible to compare information statistically. However, the in- formation and data regarding genetic susceptibilities of ototo xicity have been statisti- cally systematically analysed. Studies of high -quality and large population sizes have found that between 29 -40% of testicular cancer patients have an ototoxic phenotype (Wheeler et al. 2015) . The studies included in this systematic review used a variety of questionnaires and out- come measure s to report the presence and severity of ototoxicity and QoL. For example, the EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaire is typically used to assess health related QoL in clini- cal trials. The questionnaire was developed in 1993 by th e European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). The 36 -item questionnaire is cancer spe- cific and used for self -reporting (NK et al. Some platinum -based neurotoxicities. However, from the 36 questions, only two items \"I have trouble hear- ing\" and \"I get a ringing or buzzing in my ears\" consider the effect of ototoxicity. Tinni- tus, specifically, can present as sounds other tha n ringing or buzzing, and can be heard in the head not the ears (Tyler, Mancini 2018; Nore\u00f1a, Farley 2013; Stower 2020) . Thus, these questions may exclude people experiencing tinnitus from reporting their symp- toms (Huang et al. 2007a; Huang et al. 2007b; Calhoun et al. 2003) . On the other hand, 98 the NCIC CTG checklist consists of 8 ear and labyrinth disorders graded from 0 to 5 in severity. These disorders include tinnitus and hearing impairment, however, did not in- clude interventions or guidance on how to manage the symptoms. Audiometry is a standardised and widely available method for quantifying hearing sta- tus. There are also a variety of readily available validated tinnitus questionnaires that are used clinically for diagnosing and quantifying tinnitus severity. The gold standard of assessing hearing loss is by carrying out a PTA using the BSA protocol. However, be- cause chemotherapy is associated with many acute and life -threatening side effects, it is unrealistic and time -consuming to have measurement tools for each individual and spe- cific side effect. For this reason, questionnaires such as SCIN which group together the neurotoxic side effects, are commonly used outcome measures (Oldenburg, Fossa, et al. 2006) . These types of assessments , although more time -efficient, lack the measures to collect reliable information. Another example of this is the Holistic Needs Assessment (HNA), which asks if \"you have had any change in sight or hearing\" (Wells et al. 2015; Biddle et al. 2016) . This item, although helpful in developing a tailored care plan, does not identify specific side effects, the severity of them or if it affects QoL. Furthermore, by identifying a change in hearing and/or sight, it is unclear which specialist the patient s should be referred to , whether it be audiology or ophthalmology . There is therefore a need to strike a balance between managing the emotional components of patient care and the need to collect high -quality data on their side effects. This represents a co mmon challenge faced by clinicians and has been highlighted regularly in literature, with many new proposals on which diagnostic criteria should be used to identify the presence and severity of ototoxicity, yet no standardised measures are implemented clin ically at the 99 present time (Theunissen et Ch ang 2016; Degeest et al. 2016) . There are many potential confounding factors when assessing ototoxicity, including age at treatment, number of follow -ups and the timing of these follow -ups, type of treat- men t, dosage of treatment, type of QoL assessment and the setting these were carried out in. Furthermore, the language used in the assessment tools can also lead to patients providing unreliable and confusing information, which does not always reflect their t rue experience. For example, the readability of the questionnaires is an important con- founding factor that should be considered when analysing this type of information (Atcherson et al. 2013; Gray et al. 2019; Douglas, Kelly -Campbell 2018) . It may be the case that some adults LWBC do not have the reading level or understanding of complex, multisyllable words used by some questionnaires. The term \"ototoxicity\" must be defined when publishing research studies. There needs to be a clear definition of what the authors mean, and differentiation between hearing loss and tinnitus inf ormation (Waissbluth et al. 2017) . Without this, a detailed analysis on the severity and effect on QoL remains a challenge. 2.5. Conclusion Finally, although survival rates remain the priority in cancer treatment, there needs to be more emphasis on the importance of permanent toxicities. As people survive longer and it becomes clear that there will be a life beyond cancer, QoL becomes increasingly important. More awareness of how long -term toxicities, such as hearing loss and tinni- tus, can affect QoL, needs to be integrated into clinical practice. By raising awareness, 100 the risk of these issues being negle cted will decrease. Patients guided through the survi- vorship journey can be given relevant and tailored support, be it hearing aids, tinnitus sound therapy or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Ototoxicity is currently neither preventable nor curable, th erefore it is essential that a deeper understanding and in- creased awareness of how hearing loss and tinnitus affects the QoL of cancer survivors, in order to improve long -term symptom management. 101 What do people living with and beyond cancer discuss online about ototoxicity? A qualitative analysis of online health forums. 3.1. Background and Rationale The results from the systematic review suggest that ototoxic effects are potentially un- derreported in the scientific literature. Clear gaps in the literature were identified, not only on long term and late ototoxic effects, but how they can impact people psychologi- cally. Furthermore, the detail surrounding the specific ototoxic symptoms adults LWBC experience is lacking. A situation , therefore, has been created where there are unrelia- ble data documenting the true prevalence of ototoxicity and its associated impact on QoL (Waissbluth et al. 2017) . Consequently, this has had a substantial effect on the qual- ity of information available for both health professionals and patients regarding ototoxi- city. This is unsurprising as advers e events are typically at high risk of being underreported in clinical trials (Di Maio et al. 2015; Trotti et al. 2007; Fromme et al. 2004) . Further- more, there is a lack of scientific information on ototoxicity and few studies with long term patient follow ups (Ganz et al , 2002) . Thus , it is challenging to implement an evi- dence -based diagnostic strategy. Clinical reports of patients may not reflect the true significance of the problem. A combi- nation of tinnitus diagnos es being heavily subjective, no clear ototoxic grading syste ms available and lack of patient follow up or patients being discharged and willingness to tolerate side effects after chemotherapy are responsible for these challenges . It is essen- tial that further research be done to assess and identify the true impact of ototoxicity in cancer survivors. 102 This lack of information about long -term effects, how this can psychologically impact adults LWBC, and the few studies carried out in clinical research has meant alternative approaches must be taken. For example, by exploring what people experiencing these long -terms effects discuss not with their clinicians or when being assessed in clinical tri- als, but on the internet with others experiencing the same . The internet can often pro- vide immediate answers to quer ies one may have. Data from the American Health Infor- mation National Trends Survey (HINTS ) found that the internet is the first resource people use when looking for medical information (Langford et al. 2020) . This has poten- tial to disrupt the patient -doctor dynamic, as patients could be sceptical due to exposure to misinformation (Langford, Loeb 2019; Tan, Goonawardene 2017a; Langford et al. 2020) . Health professionals remain trusted and important information sources, the in- ternet is often becoming the first means of access to medical information, whether it is evidence -based or not. This can potentially lead to dangerous information being shared online. Findings from a qualitative study on online communities identified that some in- formation posted online may be problematic, and it is wise to be cautious when read ing suggestions from others (Armstrong, Powell 2009) . The study concluded that the major- ity of people posting on online forums sought information on other people's experi- ences, not medical suggestions and advice. A modified consensual qualitative research approach was used to analyse an online fo- rum on pregnant w omen using medication (Denton et al. 2020; Larsson 2009; Lagan et al. 2011) . Whilst this forum was commonly used to share personal experiences, some women declared that they carry medical expertise and suggested to the person seeking medical help to reduce or change their medication. A n example of this was when one 103 commenter suggested the use of ashwagandha, a medicinal herb aimed to reduce anxi- ety, to one pregnant woman, which has been associated with abortifacient effects (Denton et al. 2020) . Information found online is not always evidence -based and can often cause confusion amongst readers (Moon et al. 2019) . This can not only create health anxiety for patients, but for their clinicians too. For example, the language style of forum posts can have a significant impact on trustworthiness and credibility of healthcare claims. Positive lan- guage was found to be less sincere and less credible than using neutral language; how- ever professional affiliat ions had no imp act on trustworthiness or credibility of infor- mation. (K\u00f6nig, Jucks 2020) . Studies have shown that patients looking for healt h information online do so because of dissatisfaction with healthcare performance, poor perceived communication between their clinicians, and health anxiety (McMullan et al. 2019; Langford, Loeb 2019; Tan, Goonawardene 2017b) . It can be suggested that patients may not volunteer information about long term effects, especially if appointments are timed or they are experiencing more acute symptoms. On the other hand, when discussing late effects caused by cancer treatment, patients can be met with reticence from clinicians, and subsequently this can lead to feelings of neglect (Cordelia Galgut 2020) . This could be attributed to the fact that the field of late effects an d LWBC is an emerging field of research and not yet fully understood by clinicians not active in this area of research. One possible hypothesis could be that people experiencing ototoxicity from chemotherapy are communicating online following the dissatisf action with the clinical knowledge and support. 104 Online health forums (OHFs), also known as online health communities or online sup- port groups, are an online platform where patients can discuss their personal health -re- lated experiences openly and publicly with one another (Smedley, Coulson 2018; Gao et al. 2017) . Most OHFs are open for anyone to join the conversation, others are closed, and you must be a member of the OHF to be involved in the discussion. Individuals suf- fering from long -term and chronic effects are significantly more likely to participate in this online community to receive support, discuss health concerns, offer a dvice and de- velop online friendships (Owen et al. 2010) . Forums are unique as they rely on mem- bers to generate and consume content, providing researchers with important insights into the needs and lived experiences of those participating. These online websites display public conversations between people interacting with one another, sharing experiences, advice and thoughts. Thus, this online source of pub- lic information has meant researchers can observe novel information and ways of iden- tifying rich qualitative data without selection or researcher bias. For example, it may be participants act differently when in front of a researcher, potentially exaggerating their experiences subc onsciously . The increasing technological advances has meant that this method of research is becoming increasingly used within medicine. Moreover, OHFs are seen as a beneficial contribution to the medical field because of their 24-hour availability, low ru nning costs, geographic independence, anonymity, pri- vacy and unique sense of community (Gao et al. 2017) . Due to the nature of these OHFs, patients can also share and read information selectively and anonymously without the fear of feeling judged. In some cases, patients can ask medical professionals questions 105 that they may have forgotten or felt too embarra ssed to ask in person. This online ano- nymity potentially reduces any embarrassment people may feel in front of their clini- cians. Although this method has not currently been used to research into the effects of ototoxi- city, there have been forum analyses c arried out on multiple health issues, such as preg- nancy, men's fertility, and Parkinson's as a novel method of qualitative research (Attard, Coulson Arden et al. 2014; Hanna, Gough 2017) . OHFs are a way in which patients can contribute to a range of personal health -related discussions openly with one an- other by grouping various threads on a specific topic (Gao et al. 2017; Gill, Whisnant 2012; Said, Wanas 2011) . Analysing forum posts and messages could bring a novel in- sight to what patient's experience, and what information and support is needed to im- prove their QoL (Smedley, Coulson 2018) . 3.2. Aims and Rationale The med ical literature available has proven too variable to form any reliable conclu- sions on how QoL is impacted by ototoxicity . For this reason, an observational approach to explore information not currently present in the scientific literature is needed. The aim of this study was to explore this issue using a variety of OHFs to identify what adults LWBC experiencing ototoxic effects were discussing with one another. Secondary objectives were to explore the average timing of ototoxicity occurrence in relation to treatment, whether the adverse effect is temporary or permanent and which means of support patients have access to and use, if any at all. 3.3. Methods Ethical Considerations 106 Ethics were obtained by the University of Nottingham, School of Medicine Ethics Com- mittee on the 23/02/2018 (reference number 254 -1802). Privacy statements from all websites used were thoroughly read and adhered to, to ensure no regulations were mis- interpreted within the specific terms and conditions. Informed consent was not re- quired in this study as all information was available on a public domain and the re- search was purely observational, all members' personal details were kept anonymous to maintain confidentiality and protect privacy (Mullan 1985) . A public domain is defined by Eysenback and Till as a website where registration or subscription is not required to secure access, there is an abundant number of members, and the terms and conditions of the website are read and adhered to (Eysenbach, Till 2001) . Furthermore, a survey carried out at the Price, Waterhouse & Co. (PwC) Health Research Institute in 2012 showed that 54% (total n=1060) of participants were comfortable with their health professionals obtaining information related to their health conditions from online phy- sician communities (Gao et al., 2017) . However, messages were not shown to any per- son outside the research group to re duce the risk of revealing members' personal de- tails. Additionally, any quotes used were extracted as part of a longer, original post to reduce traceability. Pseudo names, usernames and any details which could display which forum they posted in and would a llow the member to be traced were excluded. Sample and Inclusion Criteria Forums are defined as different topics within a website and have a hierarchy -like struc- ture (Said, Wanas 2011) . These forums contain groups or sections arranged into a theme, e.g., chemotherapy. This group would then contain various threads or initial posts which can extend to form a discussion sequence in a chronological order, seen in Figure 7. 107 Although this forum review was carried out before the guidelines written by Smedley, Coulson (2018) , the methods used were consistent with th eir protocol. To acquire a rep- resentative sample of forums, the four most common search engines used to retrieve web resources were used: Google, Yahoo!, AOL and Bing (Sanjib K. Deka 2010) . Search terms consisted of a combination of ys the hierarchy of online health forums, threads and posts with examples for each, taken from Macmillan Online Community. Threads and posts are based on true posts but edited for anonymity. Only publicly available OHFs were included in the study, any web site which required a membership to view the threads were excluded. Inclusion criteria were based on stud- ies carried out by Batenburg and Das (2015) and consisted of the forums being available 24 hours a day and the website itself being in the English language (Batenburg, Das 2015) . Both active and inactive threads at an y time period were included in the study, as there was no clear rationale as to why the time period should be restricted. Threads were excluded if they contained no replies. Initially the intention was that only threads Website: Macmillan Online Community Forum: Chemotherapy Thread: First Chemo Post: Thread: Side new to this but looking for help...\" Reply: \"Welcome to the group...\"108 reporting platinum based chemotherapy were to be included, however due to the vast majority of users referring to treatment simply as \"chemo\", a wider approach was then used to prevent the exclusion of relevant threads and information. Data Extraction The data extraction was based on Gao et al., (2017) , though a more rec ent protocol has since been published by (Smedley, Coulson 2018) . To summarise, whole threads were screened and the specific messages relevant to ototoxicity were extracted for thematic coding. In addition to this, the number of members posting on the forums was also quantifie d and extracted, including how many times members posted on the topic and on how many different threads they posted on. Excel was then used to extract the data from the 9 forums. The thread name, the number of replies within the thread, the num- ber of repli es which were relevant to ototoxicity and the time -period of activity were all noted. The threads were numbered and randomised using computer software (Mi- crosoft Excel) , however individual messages within the thread remained in chronologi- cal order. This wa s carried out to reduce selectivity bias and improve the credibility of the study. The relevant message sequences were then extracted onto a word document and the thematic coding was conducted, seen in Figure 8 . 109 Figure 8 shows a flowchart of the Methods used to search and conduct an induc- tive thematic analysis of the forum posts. 110 3.4. Thematic Analysis Once data were extracted from the forums and anonymised, a qualitative thematic anal- ysis was conducted. Qualitative research aims to capture the underlying beliefs and opinions of groups of people and can help describe their lived experiences (Tuckerman et al. 2020; Guest et al. 2014) . It provides insights into a problem and can inform hy- potheses for quantitative research, however in itself does not involve numerical data. Tuckerman et al. stated \"while quantitative measures can seem more real or certain, qualitative research can offer something unique: the voice of your participants\". The thematic analysis was carried out following the Braun and Clark e 2006 Method ology . Thematic analysis involves generating themes directly from the forum messages, with- out being linked to any theoretical framework. The analysis for the forum posts adopted an exploratory approach, meaning the themes were content driven. Codes were derived from the forum posts data rather than confirming an already defined hypothesis. An in- ductive, or bottom -up, strategy was used for this analysis. This involves the researcher reading and re -reading data, looking for key words, trends and ideas that arise , shown in Figure 9 (Guest et al. 2014) . 111 Figure 9 shows an example of inductive thematic analysis from reading forum posts to developing key themes. Following this inductive strategy, open coding was performed by reading and making initial comments, followed by grouping similar codes together into categ ories and fi- nally, arranging these into clearly defined themes, seen in Figure 9 (Braun, Clarke 2006) . Messages were read multiple times and notes were made on key topics, such as when the ti nnitus and/or hearing loss began, which chemotherapy was used, which can- cer was treated and how this impacts QoL. Pilot codes were then created by rearrang- ing, separating, redefining, and merging these topics. From this, a pilot coding manual was created and sent to a second researcher (JT) , seen in Appendix C . The coding manual consisted of codes which were repeatedly found throughout the forum messages. A code was defined, assigned a number and an exam- ple of a message in which the code was found were organised into a clear table using Ex- cel. Instructions on how to use the coding manual were also provided to the second coder (JT). Randomised posts were then checked against the pilot codes and the codes Arranging categories into clear themesGrouping codes into categoriesCodingInitial commentsLooking for key trends Reading forum posts \"My hearing hasn't been the same since chemo and I have ringing in my ear\"Ringing in ears Tinnitus Hearing not the sameChanges in hearingOtotoxicityChemotherapy - induced ototoxicity112 were edited multiple times. Definitions were made clearer, similar codes w ere merged and codes were added and deleted where appropriate. The two researchers (SP and JT) independently coded the first 100 randomised messages against the coding manual and compared results. Any differences were discussed and evaluated, and the codin g man- ual was reorganised accordingly. Following this discussion, the two researchers (SP and JT) then decided on a finalised coding manual and began to categorise the codes into relevant themes. The remaining messages were once again compared against the c odes by SP and the codes were checked against the themes, rearranging and merging where appropriate until a clear, concise and definite set of codes and themes were created. 3.5. Results Data Extraction The searches found 11 different forum websites, which were further narrowed to 9 af- ter the elimination of duplicates. Subsequent searches were then made by repeating the search methods within the individual websites and a total of 34 OHFs were identified, which consisted of 91 different threads. Screening against the exclusion criteria, 5 threads were eliminated due to irrelevance (n=2) and there being less than two replies per thread (n=3). A total of 86 threads were included in the final analysis. The messages within the threads varied greatly in popularity. A t hread within a Breast Cancer forum contained over 33000 messages, whereas another threa d in the same f orum only con- sisted of 3 messages. For the larger threads, only the most relevant messages and con- versations were extracted. Relevance was defined as any po st identifying ototoxicity or a reply associated with it, i.e. \"I feel I'm turning deaf from cisplatin\" and \"me too! I can't 113 hear my wife on the phone now\". A total 559 messages were extracted for the first anal- ysis, which was updated to 570 as more messag es were posted following the initial screening. Therefore, the complete set of messages were analysed. The range of members in each thread posting about ototoxicity ranged from 1 to 17, with a total of 56 members seeking information and shar ing their experiences in multi- ple threads and forums. A total of 377 members were responsible for the 570 messages extracted, as seen in Table 11.114 Forum 1 Forum 2 Forum 3 Forum 4 Forum 5 Forum 6 Forum 7 Forum 8 Forum 9 Total Threads analysed 8 5 18 9 19 5 8 3 11 86 Messages analysed 105 41 122 68 80 14 37 21 82 570 Range of members in 56 36 83 60 62 15 33 21 67 433 Members posting in multiple ototoxicity threads 6 4 14 11 7 1 6 1 6 56 Total members in OHF discussing ototoxicity 50 32 69 49 55 14 27 20 61 377 Table 11 displays the number of messages analysed, the range of participants active in the thread, the number of members specifically discussing ototoxicity, the members posting in multiple threads and the total numbers of members in the online forum. 115 Thematic Analysis of Forum Posts The initial pilot coding manual consisted of 41 example codes, grouped into 4 different themes: ototoxic effects, quality of life, advice and support, and pharmacology and diag- nostics. Following a series of adjustments and editing, 42 final codes were generated, which created 15 subthemes. Finally, these were categorised into 6 major themes aim- ing to thematically interpret the OHF posts. The 6 main themes were: nature of ototoxi- city, time of experienced otot oxicity, information on ototoxicity, quality of life, therapies and online social support, seen in Figure 10. 116 Figure 10 displays the main themes and subthemes arising from the thematic analysis of the online forum posts. The Nature of Ototoxicity The nature of ototoxicity theme was developed from members describing and categoris- ing their ototoxic symptoms. This theme cons isted of 3 subthemes, as seen in Figure 11: tinnitus, hearing, and imbalance. Nature of ototoxicity Tinnitus Hearing Imbalance Time of experienced ototoxicity Onset Duration Information on ototoxicity Attribution of chemotherapy to ototoxicity Dissatisfaction with information provided Quality of life Practicalities Emotions Coping Mindsets Therapies Drugs Diagnostics Medical adjustments Online social support Advice and tips General support 117 Figure 11 displays the theme nature of ototoxicit y and its subthemes: imbalance, hearing and tinnitus. The tinnitus subtheme emerged from the codes general, pul- satile, continuous, intermittent, unilateral and loud; the hearing subtheme emerged from hearing loss and reduced tolerance to sound. The tinnit us subtheme explored the personal perception of tinnitus as described by the members. Many of these posts about tinnitus were expressing signs of distress and sur- prise about experiencing tinnitus. \"I experience the loudest high -pitched ringing that makes me put my hands over my ears! It drives me crazy! My clinician said I'd have this for the rest of my life. Is this for real? No one mentioned this!\" Many different aspects of tinnitus were described in the forum posts. In addition to a general tinnitus sen sation, pulsatile tinnitus, continuous tinnitus, intermittent tinnitus, unilateral tinnitus were reported. Many members described pulsatile tinnitus as a heartbeat thumping. Furthermore, u nilateral tinnitus was described by members; howev er, it was noted that there were slightly more posts on tinnitus occur- ring in the left ear compared to the right. Experiences amongst posters were varied, with some people explaini ng the different forms of their tinnitus and others simply on how intrusive it was and how it impacted their daily life. Nature of Ototoxicity Tinnitus General Pulsatile Continuous Intermittent Unilateral Loud Hearing Hearing loss Reduced tolerance to sound Imbalance118 \"After finishing my first cycle of chemo, I now have this constant high pitch ringing in my left ear. Other than this I feel fine, but will it go away or does it last forever? I'm really scared.\" Within the hearing subtheme, hearing loss was commonly mentioned by users prior to receiving treatment and being fearful of the developing a hearing loss , compared to tin- nitus which was reported by users asking for advice on the threads. Interestingly, some posts described the authors experiencing a reduced tolerance to sound. Having a re- duced tolerance to sound is not widely reported in literature as a toxic effect to chemo- therapy. Though, the p osts often gave insight to not just of hearing loss and tinnitus, but communication with their clinicians and how ototoxicity can often be one of many side effects that impact a person's health. The example below shows an experience of some- one expressing b eing overwhelmed. This may be due to the sensitivity to sound and hearing loss, but also the accumulation of distressing side effects and experiences an in- dividual may face throughout their cancer journey. It is also worth noting the experi- ence with clinic ians, and the wording audiologists use can sometimes not reassure pa- tients but make their experience more distressing. \"So, I had a hearing test which confirmed that cisplatin has damaged my hearing. I can no longer hear very well. Not just this, all the high pitch sounds sound really painful and I also have constant tinnitus. The audiologist said it is unlikely that I will ever regain my hearing and that he had not seen such damage in years, which is little comfort to me now! I can't believe I'm hearing i mpaired, sometimes it feels like it just can't get any worse!\" 119 There were also members posting their experience of imbalance. A pattern emerged within the forum posts about imbalance, however they were mainly found in threads as- sociated with breast cancer . It was noted that imbalance was mentioned alongside expe- riences with Carboplatin, Femara and Taxol treatments. The posts often sought for someone else sharing the experience and to ask for reassurance if this is a side effect of treatment or something el se entirely. \"I am currently getting weekly treatments [Taxol+Carboplatin ]. In the weeks following Carboplatin I have had acute episodes of sudden vertigo. I don't have general dizziness. Both times I was just minding my own business and suddenly felt the room spinning. The feeling doesn't last very long but it's really overwhelming. Has anyone else experienced an- ything similar? I have no previous history with vertigo, and this has only occurred since starting Carboplatin.\" Time of Experienced Ototoxicity A theme which consisted of differing experiences was the tim ing of experienced ototoxi- city. This theme entailed both the onset and duration of ototoxicity experienced by members, seen in Figure 12. Members described their onset as pre -existing prior to treatment, during treatment or late onset, specific time periods were also noted such as in which cycle of chemotherapy symptoms presented or worsen ed. Time of experienced ototoxicity Onset Preexisting condition During treatment Late onset Duration Permanent Temporary120 Figure 12 displays the hierarchy of the theme time of experienced ototoxicity, and its subthemes duration and onset. The duration subtheme consists of temporary and permanent codes, and onset consists of late onset, during treatment and pre - existing condition. \"This is worrying me; I am due to start chemotherapy but I already have congenit al mod- erate to severe hearing loss which is corrected by the use of hearing aids. The thought that chemo could make things worse is a real issue for me. The thought of chemo is scary enough but the thought of further damage to my hearing scarier still.\" \"I had bad tinnitus for weeks during treatment but it went away. I've noticed that in the past few weeks my tinnitus is back intermittently maybe 2/3 times a day after months of it not being there. Is this normal?\" The duration of tinnitus was categorised as either permanent or temporary. Users re- ported having permanent tinnitus, meaning their tinnitus did not improve or go away, compared to their tinnitus being temporary or improving drastically. The posts were emotive , seeking others that could reassure the individuals posting the messages online and often displayed signs of helplessness and worry. Information on Ototoxicity One of the discussion topics consistently reported throughout the different forums was the information on ototoxicity. This theme cons isted of two subthemes: attribution of chemotherapy to ototoxicity and dissatisfaction with the information provided, seen in Figure 13. 121 Figure 13 displays the hierarchy of the information of ototoxic effects theme. This consists of two subthemes, dissatisfaction with the information provided, and the attribution of chemotherapy to ototoxicity. The codes forming these subthemes were withdrawal of information, overwhelming information and healthcare pro- fessional and information in the dissatisfaction subtheme, and the association be- tween treatment and ototoxicity, knowing it is a rare effect and associating oto- toxicity with old age generated the attribution subtheme. Many posts associated hearing loss with old age or believed that because it is a rare side effect of chemotherapy that hearing loss must solely associated with ageing. However, many members were aware of ototoxicity a s a side effect and posted about the associa- tion between chemotherapy and ototoxicity. Those posting appeared concerned about the causality of the ototoxicity. Due to both people LWBC and researchers alike not knowing the exact time frame of when ototo xicity becomes noticeable, these questions were typically met with compassion but no answer. \"I had cisplatin and these days I have a minor ringing in my ears. I've no idea if it's due to chemotherapy or aging.\" Many members complained of their hearing w orsening during or after chemotherapy, in addition to experiencing tinnitus because of their treatment. Furthermore, many p eo- ple using the forums felt a lack of information or dissatisfaction with the information provided. People shared their anger, disapp ointment and dissatisfaction with healthcare professionals, having not been warned about ototoxicity. There appeared to Information of ototoxic effects Attribution of chemotherapy to ototoxicity Associating ototoxicity with old age Knowing it's a rare effect Association between treatment and ototoxicity Dissatisfaction with information provided Healthcare professionals and information Overwhelming information Withdrawal of information122 be an obvious lack of communication between patients and professionals, which was re- ported consistently throughout the forums. A conside rable number of members ex- pressed having felt ignored and not taken seriously during consultations. In contrast , there was also one message expressing how overwhelming information prevented them from listening to the information provided and they subse quently became fearful of the cancer journey. \"Straight after my first chemotherapy cycle, I started suffering from a ringing noise in both ears, it was there all during my second cycle. I told my Dr and she made a note but that's it. Now I still have this ringing and I wasn't warned about it. I feel like no one really cares but me. Will my hearing come back, or my tinnitus go away? Do I try and change my chemo- therapy?\" \"I think they [oncology staff] don't tell us [about ototoxicity] because they don't want to scare us away from having the treatment. My main concern right now is the tinnitus I most likely will have for the rest of my life. When I first started having it all my oncologist could say was \"I've never seen a case from carboplatin\". Like I'm m aking it up. I looked back through all my papers they gave me at first for the side effects and there was one notation about a rare side effect 'hearing changes'. I feel like I didn't have all the information I needed at the time I was making my decisions. I have also since learned that if he had low- ered my dose I most likely wouldn't have had tinnitus.\" At the other end of the spectrum, members confessed not telling their clinicians about the severity of their tinnitus and hearing loss in fear of having to compromise the dos- age of their chemotherapy and morbidity. People confessed about omitting information and downplaying side effects to their clinical team in order to continue with treatment 123 or simply forgetting to bring up the topic . It is understandable why this could be, the list of side effects caused by chemotherapy can be overwhelming in addition to the emo- tional and mental challenge of a cancer diagnosis. People forget to ask questions during clinical appointment, especially if experiencing multiple side effects. \"Has anyone here had any hearing issue after chemotherapy? I have read somewhere that hearing loss after chemo i s common. Is it true? I have been experiencing some hearing problems later but didn't bother to ask.\" \"Worried that if I tell the truth about the months tinnitus and tiredness and other side ef- fects, they'll say I'm too old and decrepit to get any more tre atment and dump me.\" Quality of Life Another main theme discovered within the forums was the severity of ototoxicity and the impact this had on QoL seen in Figure 14. Members discussed how the impact on practicalities, coping strategies and emotions compromised their QoL . However, most of the messages implied the symptoms were mild, with many members saying they had manageable symptoms , though they are so metimes hard to ignore. Quality of life Practicalities Manageable ototoxicity Daily life affected Employment affected Emotions Reminder of cancer General fear Fear of ototoxic permanence Distress Coping mindsets Acceptance Inability to cope Survival mindset124 Figure 14 displays the codes and subthemes which developed the QoL theme. The coping mindsets subtheme emerged from survival mindset, inability to cope and acceptance. The emotions subtheme consisted of dis tress, fear of permanence, general fear and reminder of cancer. Finally, the practicalities subtheme con- sisted of employment affected, daily life affected and manageable toxicity. \"I developed tinnitus after having cisplatin. I was told it could be interm ittent or just go away, and if it went away, it could always come back. Unfortunately, 2 years on and it seems to be permanent. My hearing test said I had mild hearing loss, but the bottom line is that they can't do anything for tinnitus. Most of the time when I am busy, I don't notice it, but as you probably know it is hard to ignore.\" A further issue emerged from the posts on how day to day life was affected by ototoxic effects. Many members shared concerns over how their hearing loss affecting their rela- tionship with their partners and family members. Additionally, the loss of sleep from tinnitus was also mentioned. \"I am about three years post chemotherapy treatment and now I have tinnitus in my left ear which is getting worse. I don't recall being told ch emo could damage ears and it drives me mad. The only good thing is sound sets it off so if I sit in silence, it's okay but it's affect- ing my relationship now.\" \"I chemotherapy and now I cannot hear at all in my left ear. I have recently been fitted, aged 3 9, with a hearing aid. I also have really short hair because of the chemo so they stick out. I also can't sleep with them in so I can't hear my little girl if she wakes up at night which I find just so distressing.\" Another concern found on the forum posts was the effect of ototoxicity on employment. Specifically, professional musicians shared their fear over losing the ability to hear their music. This is something not commonly found in the medical literature, how side effects 125 of treatment can sometimes im pact one's career. Cisplatin is known to cause both oto- toxicity and neuropathy, which has the potential to hinder a musician's ability to play music. Careers that depend on hearing and fine motor skills could be majorly impacted by PBC. This impact on a ca reer can also affect finances, increasing financial worry and concern, stress and anxiety thus leading to a lower QoL. \"My hearing basically went out and the tinnitus started after that really. Better than dead? At this point, probably not. The rest of my life with ringing ears, not being able to even hear certain sounds, music completely gone from my life, and certain high -pitched sounds sounding like bombs? I can't even listen to music right now; it all sounds horrible. Any high -pitched voice sounds like screaming in my ear. My ears are just extremely sensitive to certain sounds, even though the volume is turned down to half. All sounds are messed up. How soon into treatment did this begin for you others having the same experience?\" Members spoke of the r isk losing their hearing being catastrophic for their employment and even mentioned early retirement or having to leave their jobs. Some individuals compared the ototoxic symptoms being worse than the cancer diagnosis itself due to the permanent effect it had on them. More tailored approaches to individuals that rely on good hearing for a profession need to be put in place, such as alternative less ototoxic treatment to prevent this high level of distress. \"I also cannot work with this condition because my federal license to perform my job re- quires proper hearing. This side effect could end a successful career I have. It's a huge deal for me, more so than cancer. Cancer can be treated. I could have gone on for a few years enjoying life since my cancer never slowed me down one bit. Yes, it finally would have, but at least I'd have had a few more good years where I could work and enjoy the sounds of 126 life. Right now, I'm wondering if I'll ever have another day where I can hear clearly and be a productive member of society. What can we do if anything?\" One of the main issues faced with ototoxicity was how it acted as a reminder of cancer. People mentioned successfully managing the tinnitus, it acted as a permanent reminder of what difficulties they had been through. There was a sense of general fear experi- enced across the forums, as members frequently discussed being fearful of losing their hearing and how this could affect their life. In fact, many people discussed concerns over safety, such as not hearing fire alarms and ambulance sirens when d riving and how this gave them anxiety. Messages exploring the risk of hearing loss and the risk of mor- bidity were great in number as members shared personal opinions on the matter. \"I feel pretty good, except for one thing: this constant high ringing in my ears that started yesterday afternoon. I understand this is a side effect of the cisplatin. But do I have a chance of it going away any time soon? Are there any meds that can counter this? Or am I stuck with this annoying sound for the rest of my life? I' m really quite worried.\" \"This is worrying me now. I am due to start chemotherapy but I already have congenital moderate to severe hearing loss which is corrected by the use of hearing aids. The thought that chemo could make things worse is a real issue f or me - I cope reasonably well with hearing aids but am pretty much useless without them. The fact that this has not been mentioned when I have made people aware is of real concern to me and if I'm honest has now terrified me that something so precious to me is at further risk - the thought of chemo is scary enough - the thought of further damage to my hearing scarier still.\" 127 Within this sense of fear, there was a specific fear of permanence of the ototoxic effects. There were frequent concerns over how lon g the hearing loss and tinnitus would last and if it would ever recover. \"Since then [chemotherapy] I have lost a lot of hearing, probably left with 20 percent and [I] have ringing in my ears. Has anyone experienced this and gained hearing back? I am hopi ng since only a month ago I will improve.\" Associated with fear was distress and severe impact of quality of life. Many members described this as \"driving me mad\" and \"I'm going crazy\". There were messages which clearly described their hearing loss and tin nitus as \"unbearable, severe and extremely bothersome\". \"Tinnitus is controlling my life right now and I don't know what to do. I am suicidal on a daily basis. Keep thinking of the best way to end this misery once and for all. I gave up on God ever existi ng cos if he did exist then none of us would be suffering like this right now and diseases such as cancer would not exist. Sometimes I wish I had an amputated leg or hand but no tinnitus. This would be better for me as at least people would not think I hav e a mental problem.\" Three codes stemmed from the coping mind -sets subtheme: the acceptance of ototoxi- city, survival mind -set and the inability to cope. Messages on acceptance and having to \"learn to live with tinnitus\" varied from being positive to resent ful. \"I'm afraid I do not know how to say this without being very blunt, but would you really ra- ther die than live with some permanent disabilities from your cancer? Most of us have a few souvenirs from our TC experience, I think that is better than dying .\" 128 \"I finished my carboplatin treatment months ago but I'm still suffering from numbness and pain in my feet and calves, irritable bowels, and hearing loss. I have just got fitted with hearing aids. I am happy to be alive, but I can't shake off the dissati sfaction I have with the body treatment left me with.\" The most frequent coping mind -set was the survival mind -set, which involved messages such as \"ototoxicity is a small price to pay\", \"I'd rather be deaf than dead\" and \"we are alive so we should be thankful\". People also shared advice such as \"worry about the can- cer now and the side effects later\" within this survival mind -set and tended to promote this view of ignoring any side effects until after the cancer was in remission. \"I'm glad the chemo wor ked, that's the most important thing. Seems silly for us to be moaning about a bit of tinnitus.\" On the contrary, there were members with the inability to cope. There were fewer mes- sages expressing this code, however the members appeared to be emotionally strug- gling and used terms such as \"I'd rather be dead than deaf\". \"I've had the Cisplatin dose reduced for the second round due to the ringing and hearing loss. I've had progressive hearing loss I can't seem to find anything positive to report. Most say i ts permanent, including my oncologist and audiologist. I may be forced to stop treat- ment if mine gets any worse because I'd rather be dead than deaf.\" Therapies Emerging from the forum posts were discussions surrounding the different therapies available, s een in Figure 15. Members also discussed which drug treatment regimens they were on, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin and non -platinum drugs. It is 129 note -worthy, however, that many members simply described treatment as \"chemo\" and did not specify. Figure 15 displays the codes forming the subthemes drugs, diagnostics and medi- cal adjustments, which generate the theme thera pies. \"I have severe hearing loss from carboplatin . I am only 21.\" There were a few mentions of the diagnostic tests used, with an almost equal number of members stating they had no baseline test compared to having had a baseline test. \"I've been on carb oplatin and cisplatin. I cannot hear the door opening, food cooking, the television or radio and comprehend what they're saying. It's dangerous. I had a baseline reading before chemo started. Showed mild age -related hearing loss, but I could still hear! I might wait about three weeks after chemo completed to see if it improves.\" \"I didn't have a baseline test before starting chemo (no one suggested it). After I noticed some hearing loss after the first round I went to the audiologist and had my hearing tested. I was in the \"normal\" range, not perfect hearing but still ok. Therefore, my oncolo- gist wasn't too concerned. Since it has been worse after round two, I am having another hearing test today and we can compare to the first test.\" A subtheme which was re latively abundant was medical adjustments. This involved many of the members having to wear hearing aids due to the ototoxic effects, and others Therapies Drugs Carboplatin Cisplatin Oxaliplatin Non- platinum Diagnostics Baseline hearing test No baseline hearing test Medical adjustments Hearing aids Treatment regimes130 adjusting treatment regimens due to ototoxicity which involved anything from changing the drug, lowering the do se or stopping treatment all together to prevent any further hearing loss or tinnitus. This code was heavily associated with fear of permanence and distress. \"As far as permanent hearing loss, with the cisplatin it is (that is what I was told). I got hear ing aids about 3 months after treatment was over. I wasn't told hearing loss was a possibility. I was crushed - I was only 45 at the time.\" \"I had a similar experience with Cisplatin treatment, 5 years ago. I had a ~50% loss, and didn't have the last Cispl atin cycle dosed, because of that.\" Online Social Support Finally, as with most online forums, there was a sense of online social support between members, seen in Figure 16. This included support expressed by members to create a sense of community and make friends. Figure 16 showing the online social support theme and its subsequent subthemes and codes. The codes asking for advice, and offering advice developed the sub- theme advice and tips. Y ou are not alone and positive support generated the gen- eral support subtheme. The advice and tips subtheme involved many members asking for advice and offering general advice from how to ignore tinnitus to how to read lips and use other means of Online social support Advice and tips Asking for advice Offering advice General support You're not alone Positive support131 communication. There were many messages which offered positive support and en- sured people never felt alone using terms such as \"you're not alone\". From the 570 dif- ferent forum messages, only one message was interpreted as negative , stating \"get over it\". \"I've developed Tinnitus after having carboplatin. I didn't develop it straight away. In fact, I'm not sure when I did. I just realised one day that I always have a loud sizzling, singing noise in my left ear but not my right. I hadn't realised how many others have developed Tinnitus too - nice to be in good company!\" 3.6. Discussion To date, there has been little attention towards understanding what adult survivors of cancer experiencing ototoxicity discuss on line. Six main themes were developed from this study on OHFs. These aimed to reflect lived experiences of people experiencing chemotherapy -induced ototoxicity. The scientific literature surrounding chemotherapy -induced tinnitus often focusses on prevalence , risk factors and the mechanism of action (Langer e t al. 2013; Campbell, Le Prell 2018; Naples et al. 2018; Santos et al. 2020) . However, there has been little to no study o n the characteristics of tinnitus induced by chemotherapy. This online forum analysis found that tinnitus, which was mentioned 458 times in the forums, varied in volume, frequency, sound and pattern. Descriptions varied between having a \"heartbeat thumping\", to hissing sounds and being continuous and intermittent. Further research into the characteristics of chemotherapy -induced tinni tus may improve und erstanding 132 in how this occurs. Furthermore, the posts surrounding hearing loss were often associ- ated with fear, specifically whether members will regain their hearing after having chemotherapy. Hearing loss has been associated with dementia, depr ession and other co -morbidities (Adigun 2017; Nordvik Lin, Albert et al. 2016; Gurgel et al. 2014) . Within the forums' , hearing loss was mentioned 226 times by members, however the main themes surrounding these posts were about fear of losing their hearing, and fear of hearing loss being permanent. Most prior research focusses on populations who al- ready have a hearing loss. Furthermore, sensorineural hea ring loss, specifically presby- cusis, typically progresses slowly. This population of patients undergoing chemotherapy are unique in that they are more aware and alert to the possibility of hearing loss pro- gressing. It can be suggested that this in itself c an cause distress and fear amongst those experiencing hearing loss. The literature suggests chemotherapy -induced hearing loss can be permanent, the fear of ototoxic permanence was a theme mentioned often in the forums, thus, it can be suggested th at many adults LWBC are unaware of this. Reduced tolerance to sound, also known as hyperacusis, is a condition where every day sounds can become intense and overwhelming (Fackrell et al. 2019) . Hyperacusis is thought to impact 9.2% of adults in the world, and was mentioned 7 times in th e forum posts (Fackrell et al. 2017; Fackrell et al. 2019) . Hyperacusis has not been associated with chemotherapy other than in one case study, where a patient who presented with severe hyperacusis was then diagnosed with cancer. After undergoing chemotherapy, they reported their hyperacusis had worsened (Fioretti et al. 2016) . This forum study 133 therefore presents novel data about reduced tolerance to sound following chemother- apy and requires further research into this area. Imbalance is a known ototoxic effect of platinum based chemotherapy (Lin, Young 2005) . Howev er, the imbalance theme which emerged from the forums were often posted on threads related to Paclitaxel, Carboplatin and Letrozole (otherwise known as Femara) treatment. These treatments caused dizziness, they have not been specifically associate d with vertigo or imbalance. This warrants further research into this area, as imbalance is associated with a deterioration in QoL (Sailesh Kumar Goothy et al. 2020) . A theme seen throughout the forum posts was members expre ssing signs of anger and disappointment with the information, or lack of, they received about ototoxicity as a side effect of chemotherapy. There was a clear sign of dissatisfaction not only with the information provided, but with the healthcare profession als meeting the members with reticence. Several members felt ignored by their clinical team, and conspirac y theories were generated on why healthcare professionals would keep this information from pa- tients. These posts display valid and important insights into the lived experiences of these members, the field of ototoxicity, and in fact late effects in general, is relatively new. The current information on ototoxicity has typically been based around few small - scale studies with little diagnostics a nd no information on severity or onset, as seen in the systematic review in Chapter 2. (Ramma et al. 2019; Waissbluth et al. 2017) . Thus, it is not healthcare professionals purposefully withholding information about this late ef- fect, but the information itself being unreliable . Healthcare professionals are responsi- ble for how they respond to patients presenting with these symptoms . Some members posted messages on how they felt ignored, and \"brushed off\" by their clinical team. A 134 study found that tinnitus patients in general were met with reticence from their GPs (McFerran et al. 2018) . This attitude towards tinnitus patients is common, and although it has not been specifically researched in cancer patients, it could be suggested that be- cause hearing loss and tinnitus are less life -threatening acute side effects, they are not a priority for clinicians. It is certainly documented that cli nicians can have an impact on how patients perceive the severity of their side effects (Palmieri, Stern 2009) . On the other hand, cancer patients have been found to withhold information from their clinicians. The breakdown and collapse of the pat ient -doctor relationship can lead peo- ple to not discuss certain side effects or medications with their clinician, not just with chemotherapy but in general (Levy et al. 2018) . A code emerged within the forum posts from fears of members chemotherapy being reduced or stopped altogethe r: withdrawal of information. It can be hypothesised, that withholding side effects from clinicians could be part of the survival mindset and coping strategies used by cancer patients, as these codes were related to one another. However, a study found that those with poorer QoL are more likely to withdraw key medical information, and the cause is often the re- sult of not understanding clinical instructions or a mistrust in their healthcare plan (Levy et al. 2018) . The aim of this qualitative study was to identify the impact of ototoxicity on QoL, follow- ing the lack of good -quality evidence found in Chapter 2. The forum posts discussed many aspects of QoL, from coping mindse ts, emotions and practicalities. Furthermore, the QoL of those posting ranged from one extreme to the other, with some completely accepting their ototoxicity, to some ignoring their side effects and focussing, almost ob- sessively, on surviving, and others with an absolute inability to cope. A cross -sectional 135 study found that, unsurprisingly, optimism and mastery were associated with improved emotion, coping and health (Chirico et al. 2017) . It is unsurprising, therefore, that de- pression and anxiety may reduce QoL in people LWBC (Gallagher et al. 2019; Niedzwiedz et al. 2019) . There have been very few studies identifying long -term psy- chological impacts of a cancer diagnosis, however it was found that depre ssive symp- toms can persist for over 5 years after diagnosis (Maass et al. 2015) . Members posted about their emotional distress on the forums, and how they were una- ble to cope with their ototoxicity. They also posted about how side effects were \"a small price to pay for liv ing\". Coping with cancer is widely used in the psycho -oncology litera- ture and refers to \"ongoing cognitive and behavioural efforts to manage specific exter- nal and/or internal demands that are appraised as taxing or exceeding the resources of the person\" (Lazarus 1993) . Certain existing coping skills also contribute to the impact of cancer on QoL (Niedzwiedz et al. 2019) . Within oncology specifically, Greer and Wat- son (1987) grouped cancer coping strategies into: helplessness, anxious preoccupation, fighting spirit, denial and fatalism (Greer, Watson 1987) . These coping styles are seen throughout the forum posts, with many displaying the \"fighting spirit\" attitude in the survival mindset code, where cancer is considered a challenge or war -like battle . This attitu de has been associated with better long -term psychological outcomes, such as lower anxiety and depression levels (Cheng et al. 2019) , however, the coping strategy not consider late effects and tends to be used short -term . When considering the psycho- social impact of hearing loss, Heffernan et.al. (2016) found that many pe ople associated hearing loss with negativity, such as having lost authority and efficiency, and restricts people participating in social activities (Heffernan et al. 2016) . However, two main cop- ing responses emerged from this stud y: disengaged and engaged coping. This cannot be 136 directly linked to hearing loss caused by chemotherapy, similarities can be seen be- tween this study and the forum posts where people advise to \"just get on with it\" and try and accept their hearing loss (Heffernan et al. 2016) . One group posting similar thoughts and experiences on the forums were musicians. Mu- sicians, or those that relied on hearing for their career, often posted about the fear of ototoxicity being permanent , worsening or not being able to work. A systematic review found that hearing loss affected 38.6% of professional musicians and tinnitus impacted between 25.8% and 26.5% of professional musicians (Di Stadio et al. 2018) . However, many people conceal their hearing loss from their employer, or realised they had to change their career (Heffernan et al. 2016) . The late effects of chemotherapy and the im- pact this has on employment is a nee ded area of research. A meta -review by Butow et al. found that physical limitations did indeed impact the return to work. The physical limi- tations from cancer impacted work performance and required some people to reduce their time at work. Participants d escribed a fear of under -performance and a n impact on work prospects (Butow et al. 2020) . It can be suggested, therefore, that the members posting on these forums experience both the fear of work performance and undera- chieving, in addition to coping with a hearing loss and the impact this has on employ- ment. One way in wh ich members managed their ototoxicity was readjusting their treatment regime. Ototoxicity , specifically cisplatin, is con sidered a dose limiting effect of chemo- therapy (Callejo et al. 2015; Jordan et al. 2019) . Many members posted questions and fears over their clinicians' decision to reduce or change their treatment due to ototoxic effects, mainly not having the last scheduled cycle. Others sought audiological help, such 137 as hearing aids, so they could continue their treatment and management of ototoxicity. The posts surrounding hearing aids were associated with negative emotions, as mem- bers confessed feeling too young to wear them. This is a common connection people make with hearing aids, where wearing hearing aids are associated with being and look- ing older (David et al. 2018; Schroyen et al. 2020) . Another way in which members ad- justed their treatment was having a baseline hearing test and then identifyi ng changes at the end of each cycle, although it is worth noting that these were few in number. Finally, as with all online socialisation, there was a presence of online support. Only one forum post was perceived as negative. Members encouraged and advise d one another, sharing their personal experiences and knowledge. This was especially abundant among members posting about their tinnitus. A recent study found evidence of this in an analy- sis of social media platforms and found that Facebook groups predomin ately function- ing as support groups, served as a means of communication and support (Deshpande et al. 2018) . Furthermore, an additional study found that individual stories that people posted online act as an opportunity for socia l comparison, a sense of community and to maintain hope about their tinnitus (Pryce et al. 2019) . It can be argued, therefore, that the online forums in the current study served a similar purpose for people experiencing chemotherapy -related tinnitus. 3.7. Strength and Limitations There were many s trengths associated with this review. Firstly, analysing online forum posts is an emerging novel approach in research. The number of people posting online 138 and the number of forums available are increasing. Forums devoted to health and ill- ness yield several million conversations, with high levels of activity (British Psychological Society et al. 2013; Smedley, Coulson 2018) . However, the downside to this new type of information is that it may not be possible for researchers to analyse its entirety, as there are tim e and resource constraints. As with most qualitative research, the posts analysed were potentially subject to misin- terpretation from the researchers. This is made more difficult due to the messages being written and therefore typical cues, body language a nd tone of voice were absent. How- ever, multiple steps were taken to reduce the subjectivity of the analysis. This included having two independent coders, and following a rigorous and well -known psychological thematic analysis method (V. Br aun, Clarke 2006) . Furthermore, often with observa- tional studies, the presence of a researcher can skew or impact the discussions (Smedley, Coulson 2018) . By analysing these forums, conversations happen naturally between members and there is no risk of an observer skewing t his relationship or inter- action. OHFs can be used by anyone with internet access, thus this study could explore, in - depth, the impact of ototoxicity from people with little to no geographical limitations . Furthermore, the rate of cancer survivors using th e internet for health information is in- creasing (Maass et al. 2015) . On the other hand, those without internet access would not be represented in this study . Messages and posts were checked against eligibility crite- ria, there is a risk of members posting dishonest ly, or being promoted by a company (such as promoting a particular hearing aid). There was no way of investigating into this without contacting each member . This also made demographic information difficult to 139 collect. Furthermore, it may be that people post their negative experience online more often , and thus this analysis may fail to capture key information from those with posi- tive experiences. For example, someone with normal hearing is less likely to post online about hearing loss, than someon e who experienced it. This study analysed posts on online forums and therefore is not representative of the population experiencing chemotherapy -induced ototoxicity. OHFs are popular within the community, only those who have access to the internet , know how to post and com- municate with others online would be included in this study. This potentially excludes entire communities with chemotherapy -induced ototoxicity and their lived experiences. Moreover, although some members posted their location, ag e and demographic data, others remained completely anonymous. Therefore, the demographic data for most au- thors posting were not collated, other than they all wrote in English. Finally, the ethical discussions surrounding analysing forum posts are complex (Tuckerman et al. 2020) . This study was granted ethical approval by the University of Nottingham, however informed consent was not collected from participants. There is some uncertainty over whether forum posts are treated as a collection of written docu- ments, or individual participants. Participants are protected by specific ethical proce- dures, whilst documents can be used freely for research purposes (Wilkinson, Thelwall 2011) . Wilkinson and Thelwall (2011) argue that online forum posts can b e classed as online written documents, as although participants are responsible for writing the doc- uments, the messages are posted on a public domain on the internet. To add to this the- ory, the analysis is carried out on these posts, not the individual the mselves. However, as mentioned previously, little reliable information can be collected. 140 3.8. Conclusion The forum review found many posts about chemotherapy -induced ototoxicity which were thematically analysed into six key themes. First, t here was a significa nt number of reports expressing concerns about the lack of information about the risk of ototoxicity . Tinnitus was heavily associated with distress and hearing loss was associated with fear and employment issues. Those who reported pre -existing audiologica l conditions were fearful about their condition worsening as their QoL was already impacted . More sup- port for those suffering is needed; for example, improved interdepartmental communi- cation between oncology and audiology services could optimise patient ca re. Patients should also be encouraged to communicate with their health care professionals about their ototoxicity and relay how their QoL is impacted by ototoxicity when accessing sup- port. In conclusion, ototoxicity can have a significant burden on the Qo L of those suffering from cancer. More information and support should be available to this population to help manage these long -term symptoms. The ototoxic effects were associated with lower QoL, fear, isolation, depression, and frustration that patients w ere not warned enough about these effects. 141 How does ototoxicity as a late effect impact quality of life? Inter- view, questionnaire, and high -frequency audio metry study 4.1. Background and Rationale As mentioned previously, QoL is defined as an \"individual's perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns. It is a broad ranging concept af- fected in a complex way by the person's physical health, psychological state, personal beliefs, social relationships and their relationship to salient features of their environ- ment\" (Post 2014; Chabowski et al. 2017; Organization 2014) . There i s substantial literature surrounding how cancer can impact different aspects of QoL, such as experiences from ethnic minorities, experiences of returning to work and the impact cancer has on libido , (Sibeoni et al. 2018; Maguire 2016; Biddle et al. 2016; Weiss Wiesel et al. 2015) . Yet, there continues to be scarce reporting on experiences of ongoing symptoms, such as la te effects and the im- pact they have on QoL (Laidsaar -Powell et al. 2019) . The quality of social interactions for a person wit h hearing loss and tinnitus is often weakened, as taking part in conversations becomes challenging (Manchaiah et al. 2019) . QoL in addition to permanent and late effects must be used as an outcome measure due to the need to research beyond morbidity and biological functioning (Karimi, Brazier 2016) . Adults LWBC may have already experienced a difficult journey from the cancer diagnosis, the physical a nd psychological challenges of treatment and finally, remission. Adapting to a new QoL with added comorbidities such as late effects can be extremely difficult for some people both physically and psychologically (Tang et al. 2016) . 142 Currently, there is little information on how and why ototoxicity impacts QoL (Maru, Malky 2018a) . As ototoxicity is often permanent, it could have a detrimental impact on QoL without appropriate support (Tang et al. 2016) . It is essential that a deeper under- standing of how hearing loss and tinnitus specifically affects the QoL of cancer survivors is sought. This could in turn, inform the development of a person -centred and specific support system for the improvement and management of long -term symptoms. 4.2. Aims and Objectives This mixed methods study aimed to explore, in depth, the burden of hearing loss and tinnitus on adults LWBC. The severity of hearing loss and tinnitus was investigated us- ing patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), and the burden of ototoxicity was in- vestigated using patient reported experiences (PREs). In addition, the awareness sur- rounding ototoxic ity and late effects, including what support had been offered to partic- ipants, was e xplored . 4.3. Methods Outline of Methods This study was a multi -centre, exploratory study using both qualitative and quantitative method s. Qualitative methods included semi -structured interviews, which were themat- ically analysed by myself and another independe nt coder using the Braun and Clarke, 2006 framework to identify specific patterns within the study (Braun and Clarke, 2006) . Quantitative methods included three validated questionnaires (THI , HHIA/HHIE and SF - 36) which were statistically analysed using SPSS v26. The audiogram results were ana- lysed using GraphPad Prism v8. This study was designed and developed alongside a Public and Participant Involvement (PPI) representative. 143 Participants w ere recruited through multiple resources and sites, both in person and electronically, shown in Figure 17. The research assistant and I transcribed the inter- views. Thematic analysis was carried out using N Vivo v12 alongside a second coder. The study consisted of one visit per participant and was e stimated to last 2 hours. Figure 17 displays a flowchart of the methods using in the mixed -method study from recruitment strategies to data analysis. Public and Patient Involvement 144 The study was developed and sent for feedback fro m a Public and Patient Involvement (PPI) representative. A PPI representative aims to collect the views of patients, carers and families about health services, to ensure that the public views are listened to and can be understood. They do this by reviewing documents, attend ing meetings and offer- ing input and advice where necessary. The PPI representative for this project was an in- dividual who had suffered from long -term chemotherapy -induced ototoxicity. This in- volved reviewing the protocol document, helping to choos e appropriate questionnaires, ensuring that the study was safe and accommodating for participants and attending reg- ular meetings for project updates. Ethical Considerations Ethical approval was applied for via the Integrated Research Application S ystem (IRAS ), with the University of N ottingham acting as the sponsor and sought approval by the NHS Research Ethics Commit tee (REC ), Health Research Authority ( HRA ) and the Re- search and Innovation ( R&I) department s from Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS and Sherwood Forest Hospitals (SFH) NHS Foundation Trust. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined by the Dec- laration of Helsinki, 201 8; the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the UK De- partment of Health Policy Framework for Health and Social Care, 2017. The process for obtaining participant informed consent was conducted in accordance with th e REC guidance and GCP. Participants' medical or personal information obtained as a result of this study were considered confidential. Participant confidentiality was further ensured by assigning identifi cation code numbers to correspond to treatment data in the computer files. 145 Recruitment Participants were recruited from NHS clinics ( NUH NHS Trust and SFH NHS Foundation Trust), including the Late Effects Clinic, Queens Medical Centre Ear Nose and Throat (ENT ) Departments, The Germ Cell Follow -up Clinic and Ropewalk House. Non -NHS sites included: The Ear Foundation, MacMillan Information Centres at Kings Mill Hospi- tal, Nottingham City Hospital and Queens Medical Centre , National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre (BRC ) database, Maggie's Centre, the British Tinnitus Association website, Facebook and Twitter. Various other community groups were also contacted during this process. Furthermore, a press re- lease was written by the University of Nottingham media team, alongside a PPI repre- sentative (Pearson 2019) . Due to the multi -disciplinary nature of the project, discus- sions surrounding Clinical Research Network (CRN ) portfolio adoption and recruitment numbers were agreed upon by participating parties from oncology, audiology and NUH/Sherwood. Recruitment between sites ranged from having the part icipant information sheet ( PIS) and posters up in waiting rooms and reception rooms, to clinicia ns actively asking pa- tients if they would be interested in partaking in this research study and handing them the PIS. Furthermore, the PIS was shared online on Facebook, Twitter, the School of Medicine Bulletin and in the NIHR BRC Newsletter and spoken abo ut at multiple na- tional conferences. The Ropewalk Audiology service also posted the PIS alongside their referral letter. Participants were invited to the study by using the Nottingham NIHR BRC Database. This database contains no medical records, but inform ation of people who have registered an interest in participating in research. Being funded by the BRC, the re- search team ha d access to this information. 146 Eligibility Criteria Potentially eligible participants were screened against the inclusion and exclusi on crite- ria. If considered eligible, the study was discussed either in person, over the phone or via email. It was emphasised that the study was completely voluntary and that partici- pants could withdraw at any time. It was also highlighted that their usual treatment and care would not be affected by their decision. Participants were encouraged to ask ques- tions about the study. Inclusion criteria consisted of: Any person living with and beyond cancer experiencing self -reported or diag- nosed hearing loss and /or tinnitus following chemotherapy. 6 months following their first chemotherapy treatment . Age 18 at time of cancer diagnosis, no upper age limit. Ability to give informed consent. Exclusion criteria consisted of any person who had received radiotherapy to t he head and neck area. This is due to radiotherapy to the head and neck increases the risk of ototoxic symptoms, thus is a confounding factor. Furthermore, many patients undergo- ing radiotherapy to the head and neck area receive audiological or ENT support. Data Collection Informed Consent A PIS was shown to participants once again before beginning the study. All par ticipants provided informed written consent. In the event a participant could not write, mainly due to peripheral neuropathy, an online version of the consent form was provided. The 147 Informed Consent Form was signed and dated by the participant and myself or the re- search audiolog ist, before they entered the trial. Questionnaires Questionnaires were printed and given to the participants to complete during the ses- sion. These were, for the most part, completed with pen and paper but if a participant could not w rite an e -version was provided. The questionnaires, other than the basic de- mographic questionnaire, have all been validated with retest reliability, 95% confi- dence et al. 1999) . Demographic Questionnaire: A questionnaire asking basic person demographic and socioeconomic information. This included date of birth, marital status, edu- cational level, nationality, gender, and employment status. A further few ques- tions were asked about their cancer, treatment, and pre -existing he aring issues such as: age at the time of cancer diagnosis, type and stage of cancer diagnosis (if known), treatment (if known) and any previous hearing -related issues. Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults/Elderly (HHIA/HHIE): These question- naires each include 25 items which identifies the problems hearing loss may cause without the use of a hearing aid. The HHIA is designed for individuals un- der 65 years of age, and the HHIE is designed for those 65 or over. The possible responses to the 25 items are \"yes \", \"sometimes\" and \"no\". These receive a score of 4, 2 and 0 points respectively. Each item can be classed into two sub -groups, Emotional and Situational Hearing Handicap. The questionnaires are scored from 148 0-100, with 100 being the highest handicap (Newman et al. 1990; Weinstein et al. 1986; Ventry, Wein stein 1982) . Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI): This questionnaire, introduced by Newman et.al (1996) was designed to assess the impact of tinnitus in daily life. This ques- tionnaire includes 25 items which identifies, quantifies and evaluates the exper i- enced difficulties due to tinnitus (Newman et al. 1996; Newman et al. 1998) . The possible responses are \"yes\", \"somet imes\" and \"no\". These receive a score of 4, 2 and 0 points respectively. The scores are then added to yield a total score out of 100, which are interpreted under grades of tinnitus severity: slight (0 -16), mild (18-26), moderate (38 -56), severe (58 -76) and catastrophic (78 -100). 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF -36) Items: This questionnaire consists of 36 items, which measure QoL , relying on patient self -reports. The SF -36 was devel- oped at RAND Health Care as part of a Medical Outcomes Study (MOS), and the scoring method used was RAND 36 -Item Health Survey 1.0 (RAND n.d.; Lins, Carvalho 2016 ). The questionnaire consists of 8 subcategories: physical function- ing, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well -being, social functioning, energy/fatigue and g eneral health perceptions. Numeric values are recorded us- ing the scoring key given by RAND, with a higher score meaning a more favoura- ble health state. The questionnaire is scored between 0 -100. There are no stand- ardised categories, the scores were compared against the mean baseline of the Medical Outcomes Study and scored as below average, average (mean +/_ SD) and above average (Hays et al. 1995) . Interviews 149 Qualitative research typically a ims to collect information until data saturation is reached . Data saturation is defined as the point at which data collection provides no novel information (Dworkin 2012) . Saturation can be difficult to predict, however, a study comparing qualitative PhD studies found the mean was 31 +/ - 18 participants (Mason 2010) . An initial approximate sample size is typically prepared, it does not im- pact the quality of the study. It was explained to participants that they could withdraw from the study at any point. Furthermore, that they could pause or stop the interview at any point, a reason does not need to be given. In the event of a participant becoming distressed, a protocol was put in place to stop the interview and the recording, offer to pause and take a break, and act with compassion and reassurance. The researchers were trained in carrying out inter- views and r esearching into sensitive topics, the researchers also had Good Clinical Prac- tise (GCP) training. Two interviewers, myself and the research audiologist, were female and had no prior relationship to the participants. The interviews were audio -recorded in a quiet room or setting, however field notes were taken as a precaution for poor - quality audio, and to capture key information which a recording could not do, such as describe body language and the general atmosphere of the interview. Interviews were semi -structured in -depth interviews, which are the gold standard method of qualitative data collection aiming to investigate illness -related experiences (Scanlan 2020) . Semi - structured interviews allow for flexibility and deeper exploration of an individual's experience. These were developed with the help of PPI representa- tives. Interview s aim to provide rich understanding of a participants ' experience, beliefs, 150 values and perceptions whilst answering a specific research question . The key questions asked in this study, with opportunity to ask follow -up questions were: Do you recall being informed about potential hearing loss and/or tinnitus from your chemotherapy treatment? Did you have a baseline heari ng test prior to starting your chemotherapy treat- ment? How does hearing loss and/or tinnitus impact your day-to-day life? What support have you been offered? What support you would like? Exten ded High -frequency Audiometry Otoscop ic examination was performed on all participants prior to their hearing test, to check for any signs of audiological damage to the ear, such as an infection or excessive ear wax (BSA n.d.) . Following this, both standard and extended high -frequency pure tone audiometry (EHF -PTA) was carried out using a portable device named The Cal- listo (Interacoustics) , connected to a university -networked and secure laptop. The Cal- listo is a Hearing Aid Analyser that interfaces with integrated Audiologic software modules on a PC that can perform audiometry (AC440). The gold -standard British Society of Audiology (BSA) guidelines on how to perform PTA were followed, and a standard operating procedure (SOP ) and further protocol was written for the additional higher frequencies we tested in this study (British Society of Audiology n.d.) . Clear instructions were given to participants about the hearing test, and they were asked if they understood and had any questions. We also asked if the partici- pant had tinnitus at the time of the audiomet ry. Information given was as follows: 151 \"I am going to test your hearing by measuring the quietest sounds that you can hear. As soon as you hear a sound (tone), press the button. Keep it pressed for as long as you hear the sound (tone), no matter which ear you hear it in. Release the button as soon as you no longer hear the sound (tone). Whatever the sound, and no matter how faint the sound, press the button as soon as you think you hear it, and release it as soon as you think it stops.\" (BSA n.d.) In summary, PTA measure s the quiet est sounds audible to an individual, across a range of frequencies from 0.125 kHz to 8 kHz. The sounds were presented in each ear through headphones and plotted on an audiogram; a graph displaying intensity as a function of frequency (Sliwinska -Kowalska 2015) . From this, an assessment can be made to identify any signs of hearing impairment. Following this protocol, the PTA began by assessing the participants' reported better hearing ear at 1kHz at a clearly audible 40 dB HL. This ensures the participant is famil- iar with the tones and knows when to respond. If there is no response, the loudness is increased by 10 dB HL until a response occurs, or until 80 dB HL is reached. In this case, the loudness is increased by 5 dB HL and the participant is monitored for any signs of discomfort. Following this, pure tones are prese nted at 2 kHz, 4 kHz, 8 kHz, 500 Hz and 250 Hz for both ears. The higher frequencies are then tested at 10 kHz, 12.5 kHz, 14 kHz and 16 kHz. Finally, tones are presented for a second time at 1 kHz to detect any vari- ance in 2018) . Data Analysis Questi onnaires 152 Questionnaires scores were calculated for each participant by summing the scores from each question, using the scoring templates for each questionnaire . The data from the questionnaires were analysed using SPSS v26. Normality was assessed using h istograms followed by the Shapiro -Wilks test. Monocentric relationships between each question- naire sub categor y (THI, HHIA/E and SF -36) were observed using scatter plots. Correla- tion analyses between the questionnaire subcategories were assessed man's' Rho. Analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was performed to determine the association between the subcategories . Multiple linear regression models were then performed on the significant results. Furthermore, descriptive analyses were carried out on demo- graphic data, using the mean and SD for normally distributed continuous data, and me- dian and range for data found to be not -normally distributed. As the SF -36 question- naire does not have a \"Total Score\" category, the categories were averaged to create a summary QoL score for the purposes of this thesis. Interviews Interviews were transcribed verbatim by myself (SP) and a research assistant (CC) us- ing the audio -recording and Microsoft Word. All file names were coded, and any identifi- able data were removed in the transcription process for anonymity. Furthermore, all files were password protected, encrypted and stored on U niversity of Nottingham lap- tops. Only the group research assistant and I had access to the password and files. Interviews were thematically analysed using the Braun and Clarke, 2006 methods , with a bottom -up approach which was also described in Chapter 3. (Braun, Clarke 2006) . In- terviews were familiarised with by reading and re -reading the transcripts. Codes were created by highlighting and making notes on key findings using NVivo v12, a qualitative 153 analyses software. Codes were then refined, by a process of condensing, merging and adding to the initial codes. Finally, once the codes were refined, a coding manual was created and sent to the second coder , seen in Append ix K. The second coder then made notes t o further refine the codes and the coding manual. Discrepancies and differences were resolved to improve the clarity and descriptions of the codes, and finally, these were grouped into themes. The themes were discussed, and a final version of the coding manual was developed, to reflect the shared experiences and understandings of the par- ticipants. Extended High -frequency PTA Extended high -frequency PTA was performed using the Callisto and its associated soft- ware AC440. The data were stored on OtoAccess, a database designed for the AC440 software, and exported manually onto a Microsoft Excel File. The Excel File contained all participant numbers, gender, age and their maximum threshold . Normative data w ere calculated using the British Standard statistical model, using the following equations to estimate an age and gender matched median value (BS EN ISO 7029:2017 2017; Jilek et al. 2014) . These formulae were developed by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) , a worldwide federation of national standard bodies. The third edition, published in 2017, was used to calculate frequencies 0.25 kHz to 12.5 kHz, however frequencies 14 kHz and 16 kHz were derived from a paper, pub- lished in 2014, based on the second edit ion, which has since been technically revised. However, due to the lack of data for 14 kHz and 16 kHz in the third edition, this re- mained the most recent standard (Jilek et al. 2014) . H1=(Y18) 154 Equation 1: to be used for frequencies 0.25 kHz to 8 kHz, where H1 is the med ian value, in decibels (dB HL), where Y is age in years, and where and are dimensionless quan- tities, found in the statistical distribution of hearing thresholds related to age and gen- der (ISO 7029:2017) (BS EN ISO 7029:2017 2017) . H2=(Y22) Equation 2: to be used for frequencies 10 kHz and 12.5 kHz, where 2 is the median value, in dB HL and is age in years. The coefficient and the exponent for males and females are found in the statistical distribution of heari ng thresholds related to age and gender (ISO 7029:2017) (BS EN ISO 7029:2017 2017) . H3=(Y18)1.5 Equation 3: to be used for frequencies 14 kHz and 16 kHz, where 3 is the median value, in dB Hl and is age in years. The gender independent coefficient can be found in Jilek et al. (2014) . Once the age and gender matched normative data were calculated for all participants, using Microsoft Excel, the estimated thresholds were checked against the Callisto Au- diometer maximum thresholds. Any calculated threshold above the Callisto threshold was changed to match that of the Calli sto. This was done, not only for practical reasons to reduce any statistical bias, but to ensure the results could be clinically replicable. For example, a 75 -year -old male, at 14 kHz would be expected to hear at a median threshold of 137 dB HL. However, the Callisto a udiometer can only present pure tones at 14 kHz up to 80 dB HL. It would be clinically impractical to compare these two thresholds when 137 dB HL cannot be measured by audiometers. Furthermore, for participants who did 155 not he ar at the maximum threshold for any one frequency, and therefore a measure- ment could not be taken, 10 dB HL was added to the maximum threshold of the fre- quency. Taking the same example of the 75 -old-male at 14 kHz, if the participant did not respond to the maximum pure tone (80 dB HL), a value of 90 dB HL was given. 4.4. Results Ethical Considerations Ethical approval (reference 19/EM/0044) was accepted by East Midlands - Nottingham 2 Research Ethics Committee on 28th of March 2019 and the HRA and Health and Care Research Wales (HCRW) Appro val was granted (on 28th of June 2019 ). Confirmation of capacity and capability (C&C) for both NUH NHS Trust and SFH NHS Foundation Trust was also granted, with C&C given for both Trusts on the 7th of August 2019 and 18th Oc- tober 2019, respectively. Recruitment and Sample Size Data saturation for the interviews was reached at 20 participants. King's Mill Hospital, from SFH NHS Foundation Trust, recruited 5 participants, and Nottingham City Hospital, Queens Medical Centre and Ropewalk H ouse from NUH NHS Trust, recruited 15 partici- pants. However, testing was carried out in Mansfield, Nottingham, London, Leicester, Lincoln in person and one interview in Cardiff over Skype for Business who could not attend their audiometry appointment . Participants were adults (>18 years old) who had been treated with their first cycle of chemotherapy >6 months previously and had some form of chemotherapy -induced oto- toxicity. Given that the time of onset of ototoxicity is relatively unknown, and the lack of 156 active ototoxicity monitoring across the UK, the time since their first chemotherapy cy- cle did not have an upper limit. Furthermore, adults from different genders, socioeco- nomic backgrounds, and employment status were considered by attempting to recruit people fr om different charities, clinics, late effect organisations, clinicians and social me- dia. From the 20 participants, 8 (40%) were female, and 12 (60%) were male. Ages ranged between 25 and 77 (median 55) ( Table 12). Participants were White British (18), White European (1) and White Australian (1).

A basic medical history was taken from the participants, including what type of cancer they had, the type of chemotherapy t hey were treated with and any pre -existing audi- tory issues, such as tinnitus ( Table 13). The number of years since their first chemother- apy ranged from 0 .5-20 (median 4.5 years).

Questionnaire Results Normality was assessed using histograms followed by the Shapiro -Wilks test for each subcategory of the questionnaires. Furthermore, monocentric relationshi ps between the questionnaires and their subsequent subcategories were observed using scatter plots. Descriptive analyses are displayed in Table 14.

Using the consensus scoring of tinnitus severity, this population would be considered as having a mild tinnitus handicap (Newman et al. 1998; Newman et al. 1996; Fackrell et al. 2016) . Using the consensus scoring of hearing handicap, this population would be considered of having a moderate handicap (Hays et al. 1 995) . Using the baseline mean value (+/- SD) for the SF -36 from the Medical Outcomes Study as \"average\" , scores were considered below average, average or above average. All were below average, as seen in Table 15 (Hemphill 2003) . 160 Questionnaire Subcategory Score Category Number (%) THI Slight or no handicap 12 (60) Mild handicap 5 (25) Moderate handicap 2 (10) Severe handicap 1 (5) HHIA No handicap 5 (25) Mild -moderate handicap 8 (40) Significant handicap 7 (35) SF-36 Physical Function- ing Lower than average 10 (50) Average 2 (10) Higher than average 8 (40) Limitations Physi- cal Lower than average 16 (80) Average 0 (0) Higher than average 4 (20) Limitations Emo- tional Lower than average 16 (80) Average 1 (5) Higher than average 3 (15) Energy Lower than average 8 (40) Average 6 (30) Higher than average 6 (30) Wellbeing Lower than average 11 (55) Average 1 (5) Higher than average 8 (40) Social Lower than average 12 (60) Average 3 (15) Higher than average 5 (25) 161 Pain Lower than average 11 (55) Average 5 (25) Higher than average 4 (20) General Health Lower than average 12 (60) Average 6 (30) Higher than average 2 (10) Table 15 displays the questionnaire scores, in categories, and how many partici- pants were grouped into each category in number and %. The correlation analyses were used to examine the relationship between tinnitus, hear- ing loss and QoL using the questionnaire sub categories , seen in Figure 18. The QoL (SF - 36) questionnaire does not have a \"total score\" category and thus sub categories were analysed separately (Lins, Carvalho 2016) . The sub categories are mentioned previously (page 148), Figure 18 displays a summary of the questionnaire and their sub categories , and how they are scored.

The analysis of correlations between the THI, HHIA/E and SF -36 subcategories are dis- played in Figure 19. Correlation was assessed using Spearman's Rho. The descriptive in- terpretations, such as \"weak, moderate and strong\" used to categorise the correlation coefficient are subjective, and thus have been used with caution (Schober, Schwarte 2018) . However, for the purposes of this thesis, a weak correlation is defined when the coefficient is between 0 and 0.29, a moderate coefficient is defined between 0.30 - 0.49 and a strong correlation when the coeffic ient is between 0.50 and 1 (Hemphill 2003) . The results show that perceived tinnitus handicap, measured by THI, is moderately neg- atively correlated to 5 of the 8 domains of QoL seen in Figure 19, measured by the SF -36 subcategories . The THI score was negatively and moderately correlated with physical functioning (r = -0.48, p = 0.032), role limitations due to emotional problems (r = -0.45, p = 0.049 ), and strongly correlated with social functioning (r = -0.617, p = 0.004) and bodily pain (r = -0.67, p = 0.001). Thus, the higher the handicap experience from tinni- tus, the lower the individuals' QoL due to the category . Physical Limitations Emotional SF-36 Energy SF-36 Wellbeing SF-36 Social SF-36 Bodily Pain SF-36 Health THI HHIA/E Emotional HHIA/E Situational HHIA/E Total SF-36 Physical Functioning SF-36 Physical Limitations Emotional SF-36 Energy SF-36 Wellbeing SF-36 Social SF-36 Bodily Pain SF-36 General Health-1.0-0.500.51.0 Figure 19 displays a heatmap of the correlational matrix analyses from the ques- tionnaire subcategories : THI, HHIA/E (emotional, sit uational and total) and SF -36 (physical functioning, limitations physical, limitations emotional, energy, wellbe- ing, social, bodily pain and general health). Note that the THI and HHIA/E ques- tionnaires are scored from 0 -100, where 100 is the highest handic ap, and the SF - 36 is scored from 0 -100, where 100 is perfect QoL due to that domain. Thus, the higher the handicap score, the lower the QoL score from each QoL domain . The results also suggest that emotional hearing handicap, as measured by the subgroup from the HHIA, is strongly negatively correlated with emotional limitations (r = -0.53, p = 0.0015). Situational handicap is moderately negatively correlated with physical func- 164 tioning (r = -0.47, p = 0.037) and strongly negatively correlated with limitations emo- tional (r = -0.51, p = 0.021) as measured by SF -36 ( Figure 19). Total hearing handicap was strongly negatively correlated with limitations emotional (r = -0.51, p = 0.013) and negatively moderately correlated with pain (r = -0.44, p = 0.043). A multiple linear regression was run to predict QoL related pain from tinnitus and hear- ing handicap. The variabl es statistically significantly predicted QoL related pain, ( F (2, 17) = 5.983 p < 0.011), with an R2 of 0.413. Thus, this model is statistically significantly better than a null model. However, the model predicts 41 % of the variance in QoL , leav- ing 59% of the variance is equal to 78.99 - 0.295 (HHIA) - 0.691 (THI). Pain related QoL decreased 0.691 points for each unit change in tinnitus handicap score there was a decrease of 0.295 points for each hearing handicap sc ore. THI was independently associated with QoL after adjustment for HHIA (p = 0.03). This means there is a statistically significant association between THI and QoL after adjustment for HHIA. Extended High -frequency Pure Tone Audiometry Results From the 2 0 participants, 19 had a complete EHF PTA. One participant was unable to be tested due to geographical limitations. Results from the EHF -PTA were manually in- putted onto Excel using the Audiogram software Callisto Suite, seen in Figure 20. 165 Figure 20 displays an example o f how the audiogram data were imported from the Callisto Suite into a table. Once the data were collected and the normative maximum thresholds were adjusted, the table was exported into GraphPad Prism v8 for analysis. The mean and standard de- viation for each frequency was calculated to observe any visual differences between the thresholds, seen in Figure 21 and Figure 22. 166 0.251361014 0.251361014 0.251361014020406080100 Frequencies kHzdB HLNormative Max Thresholds Right Ear Max Thresholds Left Ear Max Thresholds Figure 21 displays the mean and standard deviation of the audiogram results (normative, right ear and left ear), at each frequency. 167 12345678910111213151617181920050100150 Participant NumberdB HLNormative Max Thresholds Right Ear Max Thresholds Left Ear Max Thresholds Figure 22 displays the mean maximum thresholds (dB HL) across all frequencies (kHz) for each participant. Some participants (4, 9, 15, 19) have a similar thresh- old value to the normative data, other participants have a visually apparen t dif- ference to the n orm (3, 6, 12, 16, 17, 18). A repeated measures one -way ANOVA was performed, and the post -hoc Tukey's test used to compare the pairwise maximum thresholds (dB HL) of the participants left ear, right ear and the normative dataset. There was a statistically significant effect (p < 0.0001) between the three mean thresholds [F (1.287, 23.16) = 40.57 p < 0.001]. Post hoc comparisons using the Tukey test indicated that the mean thresholds in the norma- tive dataset (23.22 dB HL ) were significantly smaller than the mean threshold in the right ear (41.05 dB HL ) (p < 0.0001) and significantly different than the mean threshold in the left ear (41.62) (p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences between the 168 left and right ear. This suggests that the participants i n this study have a statistically sig- nificantly higher hearing threshold (dB HL) following chemotherapy than the normative age and gender matched thresholds. A second repeated measures one -way ANOVA was performed for each frequency, ad- justed with a Bonferr oni correction for multiple comparisons. This was to identify any particular frequencies that are statistically significant between the participant's maxi- mum thresholds and the normative data maximum thresholds. There was a significant effect [F (5.379, 96 .83) = 58.76, p < 0.0001] between the thresholds at each frequency measured , seen in Table 16. Frequencies 0.5 kHz, 1 kHz, 3 kHz, 8 kHz, 10 kHz, 12.5 kH z and 16 kHz were all statistically significantly different between both the right ear and left ear, compared to their matched normative data.

Thematic Analysis of Interviews Interviews were all carried out in person other than for one participant which was car- ried out using Skype. The timing of the interviews range d from 17 minutes to 68 minutes, and included the interviewer, the participant and at times, a spouse or partner if they felt they had experiences to contribute. Furthermore, the research audiologist was present during 18 interviews to make field notes and offer any signposting or gen- eral support once the interviews ended. Myself and the research audiologist are both fe- male and had no prior relationship with any of the participants. An inductive approach to thematic analysis was used, and 34 codes were developed from the interview transcripts and fieldnotes. These were then divided into 10 sub- themes and finally, two m ain themes were established : Ototoxicity Related Quality of Life, and Cancer Related Quality of Life , shown in Figure 23. 170 Figure 23 displays the main themes, Theme 1: Ototoxicity related quality of life which included the impact of ototoxicity, hearing tinnitus, clinical experience and audiological assessments and Theme 2: Cancer related quality of life which in- cluded impact of treatment, cancer and chemotherapy, other toxicities, infor- mation and patient reflections. This thematic analysis captured the direct and indirect experiences of those with chem- otherapy -induced ototoxicity, and how it has an impact on quality of life. Though the frequency of the codes was considered, it does not reflect the import ance of the code, as seen in Figure 24. Therefore, the number of occurrences from each code is not reported or discussed. The themes and subthemes are re ported in detail in the following section. Ototoxicity Related Quality of Life Impact of Ototoxicity Hearing Tinnitus Clinical Experience Audiological AssessmentsCancer Related Quality of Life Impact of Treatment Cancer and Chemotherapy Other Toxicities Information Patient Reflections 171 Figure 24 displays a sunburst chart of the hierarchy of themes arising from the thematic analysis of the transcripts. Themes are depicted in the innermost ring; subthemes are depicted in the middle ring and codes in the outmost ring. The size of the themes correlates with the number of codes associated with each theme, as the codes hold equal value to one another. Theme 1: Ototoxicity Related Quality of Life 172 The participants spoke about their experiences o f how their ototoxicity directly and in- directly impacts their daily living. Most of the codes directly correlate to their personal experience with ototoxicity, such as hearing, tinnitus and impact of ototoxicity, partici- pants of ten reflected on the audiological assessments they underwent, or lack of, and their experiences with their clinicians when discussion their hearing loss or tinnitus with them. During the interview process the participants spoke about audiological as- sessmen ts, or lack o f, they underwent during their chemotherapy. Furthermore, the discussion surrounding the impact of ototoxicity varied between posi- tive and negative experiences. Descriptions of the negative experiences the participants faced were almost alway s associated with specific circumstances, such as social situa- tions, other side effects and a fear that their ototoxic symptoms may get worse over time. On the other hand, other participants described their ototoxicity not being a major impact on their day to day living, or that they had simply gained the ability to habituate . Audiological Assessments During the interviews, participants were asked if they had ever had, or been referred, to have a baseline PTA or hearing evaluation prior to starting chemotherapy treatment. They were also asked if they had ever had a hearing test, excluding a baseline for chem- otherapy. Their answers, and any other mention of hearing evaluations, were included in audiological assessments. \"No, no I didn't have any [PTA] baseline, but for other things I did, so I was on Herceptin for a while and before that, I had a baselin e echocardiogram. And then after I finished, I then had another one partway through my pattern as well but then certainly no hearing test.\" (P19) 173 Only one participant described being offered a baseline hearing test. However, despite this offer, the partici pant explained that they declined as they believed nothing could be done to reverse the impact of chemotherapy on hearing so their results would not mat- ter. This demonstrates that hearing, and ototoxicity more generally, are overlooked in the treatment of the cancer patients in this study. Incorporating baseline hearing evalu- ations prior to starting to treatment would be greatly beneficial, and patients hearing should be monitored during treatment to assess any ototoxic effects the participants might be exp eriencing. \"After about six months [into treatment], I was offered a hearing test but declined it be- cause well, I didn't see the point as there was no solution for it even if there was a prob- lem.\" (P10) Clinical Experience A subtheme that became prominent amongst the participants was their personal experi- ences with clinicians when mentioning ototoxic symptoms . This subtheme describes how the participants felt about the support and information they received from their cli- nician. The term clinician includes oncologists, general practitioners (GPs) and any other person on the participants' usual care team. It became clear that participants en- countered two contrasting experiences with their clinicians: support and reticence. En- couragingly, many participants des cribed positive experiences and expressed how sup- ported they felt by their clinical team with regards to ototoxic symptoms there were having. Conversely, p articipants mentioned that they felt some clinicians \"brushed off\" their experience of ototoxicity. \"With the tinnitus I got nothing, I got \"you have tinnitus, off you go\". (P2) 174 \"It's a get out of jail card for people now, because no matter what the symptom is you get told it's a side effect of treatment and to go and see your oncologist instead, but the y have to deal with the cancer too, so I'm getting ping ponged backwards and forwards.\" (P6) It is worth noting, that all participants' expressed gratitude and appreciation to their care team irrespective of support received. Participants were clear in how much they valued their care team and held them in high regard for treating their cancer. However, participants recount ed discussions of ototoxicity in a much more positive light and de- scribe much more understanding of what their circumstances were when me t with sup- port from their care team. The experiences participants highlighted demonstrate that there is great value in having a reassuring and understanding care team, in all aspects of chemotherapy side -effects. \"She sort of talked me through everything, and everything was clear and weighted. I got offered a referral if I wanted it.\" (P13) Hearing The hearing subtheme encapsulated both the physiological descriptions of hearing changes the participants mentioned, and the psychological issues surrounding th is change. The most common hearing issue that was mentioned was auditory perception difficulties. This described any mention of situational or directional hearing loss, such as difficulty hearing in background noise. Many participants described changes to their hearing levels after receiving chemotherapy, which was predominantly a reduction of their ability to hear quieter sounds. Participants described occurrences of situational or directional hearing loss, such as difficulty hearing in background noise, w hich is com- monly seen in patients who have undergone chemotherapy. 175 \"Situations like a restaurant or a pub or a party, I'd notice I wouldn't be able to hear peo- ple as well as before.\" (P16) \"It's like there's gaps. If I turned my head over, suddenly bi ts of voice would just drop out. It was really directional so I was constantly having to turn my heard to hear what people were saying to me.\" (P18) Furthermore, sp ecific experiences of hearing loss were described by participants. \"I just couldn't hear, espec ially if people spoke softly, or women and children's voices. I just couldn't hear them.\" (P1) An unexpected code emerged from the interview transcripts, wh ere participants de- scribed having an increased sensitivity to sound. This was also found in the Foru m Re- view in Chapter 3. but has not yet been discussed in the medical literature. Certain sounds produced new responses in participants which they had not experienced before. These responses resemble similar responses seen in patients who have the hearing dis- orders misophonia and /or hyperacusis. \"I just couldn't go near the tube, the traffic, busses, everything was so loud it hurt.\" (P10) \"A lot of loud noises really started to irritate me quicker than before, like a dog as barking and it just seemed really loud. Once the chemo f inished it cleared up but for a few months it was horrid.\" (P16) Participants were asked if they could remember when their hearing deficit began or worsened. The onset of hearing changes ranged from during the first few cycles of chemotherapy, to noticing it a year after chemotherapy ended. The difference in timing 176 of onset of hearing changes further illustrates the importance of monitoring for ototoxic effects not only during treatment, but afterwards. Changes to hearing and tinnitus, like other late effec ts of chemotherapy, have a critical role in adjusting to life after treatment and should be considered with such importance . Another critical issue which emerged from the interviews was the fear of hearing dete- riorating. Participants often mentioned feeli ng fearful of not knowing if their hearing loss will worsen, be permanent, or if there is anything that can be done to prevent fur- ther deterioration. \"It would have been about halfway through my main block of treatments, after the third week maybe? By the fifth week I noticed a definite loss but I can't remember when it started exactly.\" (P18) \"When it started to deteriorate and go, I thought, I'm going to be totally Deaf. Does it come back? Is it going to go up and down? Pretty difficult to deal with.\" (P 18) \"I'm scared of it getting worse, it'll be a big thing if it gets worse.\" (P3) Education and information of ototoxicity is therefore key for chemotherapy patients, along with guidance and support on how to deal with any issues should they arise . Tinnit us Many participants described their experience of tinnitus since having chemotherapy treatment. Participants discussed their individual experiences which included the dif- ferent types of tinnitus they have such as the frequency and location. There was a co m- bination of both lateral and bilateral tinnitus detailed by participants, as well as the fre-177 quency of their tinnitus, with most participants describing a high pitch. Many of the par- ticipants discussed having, or attempting, some form of habituation of tin nitus. The im- portance of habituation in aiding coping and adjusting to tinnitus is longstanding evi- dence shows that those who habituate to tinnitus have lower levels of tinnitus related distress, anxiety and depression (Hallam et al. 2008; Beukes et al. 2015) . Some partici- pants explained that they tried to ignore the sound of their tinnitus, while others de- scribed a sense of 'getting used to it'. There were, however, mentions of having a fear of tinnitus, where participants would talk about being fearful of their tinnitus worsening. \"It's certainly a high -level hiss now, in both ears. It's constant. It never goes awa y.\" (P14) However, many of the participants discussed having, or attempting, some form of habit- uation of tinnitus. \"From my space, because it's there all the time you just develop an ability to ignore it. I use headphones a lot more because it goes straig ht to my ear and the tinnitus is easier to ig- nore that way.\" (P14) On the contrary, there were mentions of having a fear of tinnitus, where participants would talk about being fearful of their tinnitus worsening. \"I worry I won't habituate enough, and it' ll get worse. I won't be able to sleep like I can now.\" (P12) Being fearful of tinnitus has been shown to correlate with not only decreased QoL, but also with having more direct attention towards tinnitus and therefore these patients are less likely to ach ieve habituation to tinnitus and perceive their symptoms as more se- vere (Cima, RF et al. 2011) . 178 Participants were also asked if they remembered the onset of tinnitus. Four participants had experienced tinnitus prior to undergoing chemotherapy, however for those who had not experienced tinnitus before, the onset varied from the early stages of treatme nt, to further along in their chemotherapy regime. \"I asked myself that question, when did it all start? I got it every so often before having chemo and then one day it just didn't go away and it became a problem.\" (P12) Once again, this further underlines the need for continuous monitoring of patients for ototoxicity throughout and after their treatment. Impact of Ototoxicity The impact of ototoxicity on QoL was discussed at length by each participant. There were mentio ns of feelings of exhaustion from the continuous tinnitus sounds which also caused sleep disturbances, as well as frustration at how their ototoxic symptoms af- fected their ability to communicate effectively with others. Furthermore, experiences on how otot oxicity socially impacted the participants was commented on. This included hearing loss, tinnitus, or both having an impact on people's social lives. \"You can hear it all the time. It just gets on your nerves. Especially when you're sat quiet, I can still here it now, yeah, it effects everything.\" (P9) \"At night it's easy to ignore because of the traffic and noises outside but sometimes it does just hit me. It's really just there in your face and you can't ignore it.\" (P12) \"I'm knackered and it's just his s. People can stand in front of me and speak and I'm stress- ing because I just hear hiss.\" (P14) 179 The negative effect of decreased social interaction from not only hearing loss and tinni- tus, but decreased social interaction in a more general sense, is well k nown and long es- tablished and was evidenced in the interviews with participants. Furthermore, partici- pants spoke about surrendering to tinnitus. This is described as giving in to it in a nega- tive way. Some participants openly spoke about how they feel otot oxicity worsened their QoL in a significant way. \"When it's at it's worse I just think, I just have to get through this, I just need to get through it and it'll hopefully die down.\" (P18) \"I struggled to engage in anything, the tinnitus was frustrating, I wouldn't engage in much more.\" (P16) Another code which developed from this was how ototoxicity, specifically tinnitus, has an impact on sleep disturbances. \"For my sleep I take sedatives. I hear it [tinnitus] when it's quiet but I deal with it because I know at some point I'll be asleep and it'll be gone.\" (P6) Furthermore, experiences on how ototoxicity socially impacted the participants was commented on. This included hearing loss, tinnitus or both having an impact of people's social lives. The experie nce of ototoxicity impacting the participants socially also im- pacted their emotional and mental health. For example, some participants spoke about feeling nervous about going out . Though it cannot be presumed that there is a direct as- sociation between otot oxicity and mental health, the experiences told by the partici- pants certainly suggest a relationship between the two . 180 \"There's a social interaction when you just can't hear. It's funny, my ears seem to tune in. I can hear certain people a bit better than others. Ladies' voices - just nothing.\" (P14) \"I don't like social scenes because I'm very nervous with it. I don't want to go out, I have to be with someone comfortable.\" (P8) However, conversely some participants shared that ototoxicity was a low priority for them, meaning that it did not have a great impact on their QoL compared to other long - term side effects they experience. This outlook was generally seen in participants who viewed ototoxicity as a minor inconvenience in comparison to the effects of ca ncer prior to chemotherapy. \"My hearing just wasn't a priority really at the time. Just recently really, but it doesn't bother me too much.\" (P13) \"It is what it is, it's an inconvenience, but I'm alive.\" (P10) On the other hand, for some participants it indeed worsened QoL in a significant way . Though participants explained that they felt grateful to be alive and explored during the interviews how maybe it was for the best they were not fully aware of permanent side effects when given a choice about treat ment. For example, some participants spoke about how they understand that their life has irreversibly changed. \"When you get that diagnosis and you go to the oncologist, they give you chemo. If they had said my hearing was going to go on top of all that I would have been straight down the pub, my backup retirement plan, which is a large bottle of single malt and a massive pile of paracetamol.\" (P14) 181 \"You're in a rock and a hard place, aren't you? It's changed my life.\" (P2) Theme 2: Cancer Relate d Quality of Life Although this project focusses on ototoxicity, some participants expressed how difficult it was to isolate a side effect and identify how their life has changed due to a side effect . Participants highlighted the impact of treatment, the im pact of other toxicities experi- enced as a result of chemotherapy, more general discussion of cancer and chemother- apy, and finally patient reflections on their cancer journey and experience. This theme is not specifically related to ototoxicity, it is important to note that these themes are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they are often associated with one another . These are ex- plored in more detail below. This theme was developed from the conversations surrounding the impact of treatment, other tox icities from cancer and chemotherapy, information about their treatment and finally, patient reflections on their cancer journey and experience . Cancer and Chemotherapy Participants were asked about the type of cancer, the type of treatment they had, and the number of cycles of treatment they received. There was a large disparity among pa- tients regarding the nature of their chemotherapy . In fact, some participants thought chemotherapy was one drug in itself, that there weren't different types or doses . On the contrary, other participants had organised spreadsheets and information about their treatment. These developed one subtheme, there were two extreme types of answers and discussion. Some participants were very unaware of the types of chemot herapy treatment they received but were also unperturbed by this lack of knowledge and avoidance of information. 182 \"I just know it's testicular cancer and it spread.\" (P12) \"The only time I saw my chemo was when it was in a bag, that's all I know.\" (P8) \"I had intravenous treatment for two hours, two weeks of tablets then a week off. I had a lot of cycles.\" (P9) On the contrary, other participants were able to give an in -depth recollection and lists of their treatment which included names of medications, meth ods of treatment and treat- ment cycles. This polarity of behaviour of information seeking and avoidance are com- mon in patients of chronic illness and are employed as coping mechanisms to aid adjust- ment to illness (De Ridder et al. 2008) Other Toxicities Although discussion mainly evolved around ototoxicity, a pattern developed between those experie ncing ototoxicity and other toxicities. For example, a few individuals men- tioned having balance problems. This can be interpreted as a vestibulotoxicity, and therefore ototoxicity, no formal medical assessment or questionnaire measured signs of vestibular dysfunction. Balance problems are multi -factorial, and could be associated with neuropathy, dizziness or proprioception deficits (Desai, McKinnon 2020) . \"I find I lose my balance sometimes, sort of as if you're walking and you're standing on a plank.\" (P1) Neuropathy was mentioned by most participants. This was any mention of chemother- apy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), and specific mentions of reacting to cool temperatures. A common complaint was h aving chemotherapy -related cognitive effects, commonly referred to as 'chemo -brain'. 183 \"Forgot I used to put things in places and I couldn't remember where things were I'd lose stuff all the time. And I thought I either had a brain tumour because it was it was that bad, and I you know I'm normally such an organized person. I know where everything is, I can juggle, and it wasn't till I went back to the consultant and told him and he said, argh - it's chemo brain!\" (P19) The term 'chemo brain' was a common feat ure of the discussions with participants and was used frequently by participants. Participants also seemed to use this in conversa- tion with family and friends as a colloquial term and way for them to describe their ex- periences more casually. Additionally, chemotherapy -related fatigue was also spoken about considerably as a late effect of cancer treatment. \"Although the most difficult part started, actually at the end of last year, because I started to develop some side effects that I'm still trying to deal with. In particular, I'm feeling ex- tremely tired.\" (P17) This is perhaps more notable than other effects mentioned in relation to ototoxicity, as there are also recent findings which indicate the effect of hearing impairment of fatigue (Holman et al. 2019) . Patients who have undergone chemotherapy and are also experi- enci ng a hearing loss could be experiencing fatigue from both factors , which in turn ex- acerbate the other. \"I couldn't pick up cutlery because it was too cold, and it was painful for food and I ended up just eating with a plastic fork.\" (P14) 184 Impact of Treatm ent Experiences were discussed by the participants on how their lives were impacted by treatment, both directly and indirectly. Specifically, how the participant's managed their chemotherapy -related side effects was spoken about frequently, creating the co de cop- ing with late effects. It was clear from the discussions that the late effects of the chemo- therapy treatment were among the most difficult elements of their experience. \"After I finished treatment, I left the hospital, that's when the biggest side ef fects really hit me.\" (P18) \"The cancer took away the strength to cope, it took away the kind of energy I was using to fight back.\" (P17) \"You have to get on with your normal life as much as you can. However, the treatment just broke me.\" (P2) Another deve lopment was the impact this had on mental health. Specifically, how LWBC impacts mental health. \"I need to ignore it to stay upbeat and positive. Because otherwise it just brings me down too much.\" (P18) \"Oh yeah, definitely. For me personally yeah, the p sychological. The dread of what could go wrong as opposed to what actually goes wrong. I mean like it comes hand in hand really.\" (P18) 185 \"Yeah. I think if you let it get you down, you can let it, but I'm not gonna let it get me down. I've been through too m uch to let this get me down. So, I just want to keep doing what I can do from day to day.\" (P9) Finally, Support from Family and Friends and the gratitude the participants felt towards their loved ones was a topic mentioned very frequently. \"It was mainly my family and friends that supported me. I was too busy during treatment to go there [charities/information centres].\" (P12) Information The quality of information that the participants received was reviewed. This included the tools that were used to present the information, such as leaflets and books . \"Yes, I got a lot of leaflets, not really useful to me because I didn't read them. I was in shock so I've only just gone through and read them years later. I just never looked at them.\" (P1) \"I just sta rted to get leaflet overload.\" (P14) \"I was quite happy just sitting and reading everything, some were better than others but I found them really useful.\" (P17) Although there were different opinions on the information tools, such as the use of leaf- lets an d using the internet, the timing of information was also a key factor in awareness and understanding of side effects. \"When you're in hospital everything is overwhelming, later on when you're out of hospital and in follow up everything sinks in a bit more .\" (P16) 186 Many felt that processing information was difficult, with some participants expressing difficulties with taking the information in. All but two participants found the infor- mation overwhelming, with two participants finding the information suitable and easy to digest. \"We were just shown too much information and it was overwhelming. It was too much too quickly.\" (P1) However, when specifically asked about hearing loss and tinnitus, two codes were formed: clear information and no information. In the clear information code, partici- pants expressed that they had a full understanding of the ototoxic risk of chemotherapy. \"There was a long list of side effects indeed, but in some sense, they were weighed. The Dr went through them all with me and explaine d which ones were more common and so on. Tinnitus was mentioned I remember that very clearly.\" (P17) On the other hand, other participants did not recall receiving any information about oto- toxicity. The timing of information being presented was also a key factor in not only having an awareness of the possibility of ototoxic side -effects, but also an understand- ing of ototoxicity. \"I don't recall anything being mentioned about tinnitus at all. I just noticed the tinnitus af- ter the treatment finished when I w ent home.\" (P5) Patient Reflections A subtheme that emerged from the interviews was patient reflections. This included a wide range of tips, advice and guidance from the participants on how they made their 187 treatment easier to live with, or how they would h elp others go through their experi- ences. This subtheme ranged from positive insights on what services could be imple- mented or improved, to describing how their mindsets have changed through the can- cer journey. Most participants focussed on ototoxicity, alt hough general comments were also included. \"It's [cancer] not nice, but it's doable. It's really one hell of a journey, but it's doable.\" (P14) \"A baseline audio test would have been helpful, or even a chat with an audio specialist just to sit and chat th ings through with you, as a standard. Even to warn you, okay, you might get these effects and if you do let us know. Rather than just dealing with it after you get it.\" (P18) 4.5. Discussion Through these semi -structured interviews, the questionnaires and the E HF PTAs, direct and indirect impacts on how ototoxicity has changed people's daily lives were explored. The questionnaires and EHF PTAs aimed to objectively measure and identify any pat- terns between QoL and ototoxicity. The themes from the interviews aimed to represent the in -depth experiences and insights into the issues surrounding awareness, support and impact on QoL from chemotherapy -induced ototoxicity. The WHO defines health as \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well -being, and not merel y the absence of disease and infirmity .\" This definition influenced the de- velopment of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form family of measures (such as the SF-36). Other examples of definitions of QoL are: \"a conscious cognitive judgment of sat- isfaction w ith one's life\" and \"an individuals' perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, 188 expectations, standards and concerns .\" People with cancer face difficult decisions re- garding treatment and the possibly of trading QoL with length of life . Many adults LWBC prioritise QoL over length of life , something that should not be ignored (Shrestha et al. 2019) . From the results, it c an be suggested that the psychological impact of ototoxicity has a greater impact on QoL compared to the physical symptoms. The THI was moderately correlated with emotional limitations, strongly correlated with social functioning and pain. The HHIA was als o strongly correlated with emotional limitations and moderately correlated with pain. During the interviews, the confusion and lack of understanding about what was happening when developing ototoxic symptoms was mentioned by al- most all participants. When t alking about their experiences of ototoxicity, it was clear that many participants were fear ful. This was in relation to both a fear of their hearing deteriorating and their tinnitus deteriorating, and how they would not be able to cope. Health -related fea r and anxiety has consistently been shown to have a detrimental ef- fect on QoL (Ohkura et al. 2020) , which can also be exacerbated by a lack of knowledge of the conditions being experienced (Derry et al. 2019; Fernandes et al. 2 020; Brandberg et al. 2016; Haack et al. 2020) . Many participants in this study described that they were unaware of the effects of oto- toxicity prior to experiencing them. They expressed that the information may have been initially presented to them pri or to treatment, but that they were unable to absorb this information due to a feeling overwhelmed. This demonstrates that there is a need to en- sure that patients are aware of the ototoxic effects of chemotherapy throughout the 189 treatment process and upon t reatment completion. Conversations surrounding side ef- fects, including late effects, should be ongoing at different timepoints during the chemo- therapy journey to ensure information can be used effectively and prevent \"leaflet over- load .\" Thus, information t ools should be used similarly to personalised medicine, where the information, guidance and support should be optimised to the individual. For exam- ple, some participants expressed wanting to be warned about the effects, whereas oth- ers felt they would not e ngage with any information at that time. The findings show that, overall, ototoxicity is not widely known as a side effect of plati- num based chemotherapy until it is experienced personally. This may be due to the lack of standardised ototoxicity monitorin g 2018a) , the ineffectiveness of using leaflet s and websites to inform patients of side effects, or the lack of current prevention and treatment options available. From the themes developed, it is suggested that clinical perspectives on tinnitus can be a factor in their patients' QoL outcomes. It is w ell known that people who suffer from tinnitus often feel ignored by their GPs, and can be dissatisfied with the service they re- ceived (McFerran et al. 2018; McFerran et al. 2019) . This not may directly correlate with oncologists, it is worth noting that those who felt supported by their oncologists spoke less fearfully about their ototoxic symptoms. However, the lack of information and awareness about ototoxicity may extend to clinical staff in addition to patients, and there is an opportunity for future research to investigate this. Only 4 participants expe- rienced tinnitus prior to receiving chemotherapy treatment, whereas 17 participants mentioned having tinnitus following chemotherapy. 190 The results from the questionnaires display moderate correlations between tinnitus handicap (THI), hearing handicap (HHIA/HHIE) and social related QoL (SF -36). Throughout the course of the interviews, participants highlighted that one of th e main areas in which they had been impacted by their symptoms of ototoxicity was in social situations, making it difficult for them to communicate with their friends and family. This is cause for concern as communicating and having social support from lov ed ones is key for aiding an individual's coping and adjustment to chronic illness and has been shown to be a significant coping resource in cancer patients (Fong et al. 2017; Ozdemir, Tas Arslan 2018) . By improving the information and support offered through audiologi- cal referrals and increased awareness, interventions such as hearing aids could be used in this population to reduce this impact on social life, thus improving patients' abilities to cope. It may also be useful to consider including a friend or family member in future interven- tions/awareness schemes. The Developmental -Contextual Model of couples with chronic i llness (Berg, Upchurch 2007) expands on the social support perspective and puts forward a dyadic approach to coping. Couples specifically interact when dealing with stressors and their interdependence affects appraisals of illness, appraisals of stressors and ways in which they cope. Due to the impact of ototoxicity on QoL being mainly social, including the partner in the promotion of awareness of ototoxic effects of chemotherapy may be a significant help to the patient, not only for awareness of poten- tial barriers to communication, but also for coping and adjusting to ototoxic symptoms if they appear. 191 Cancer patients often experience an increased level of stress caused by the cancer and its associated treatment. Many coping strategies have been established for tinnitus suf- ferers, such as effective coping and maladaptive coping. These coping strategies s uggest, unsurprisingly, that catastrophising and failure in accepting tinnitus results in a worse (Budd, Pught 1996) . Furthermore, the participants' EHF in this study to be statistically signif- icantly different from the normative dataset includes the following frequencies: 0.5 kHz, 1 kHz, 3 kHz, 8 kHz, 10 kHz, 12.5 kHz and 16 kHz. A pattern observed wit h the EHF PTAs was that b igger differences between the normative dataset and participant's PTA results were apparent in older adults, though the sample size was too small to identify if the difference was statistically significant or just an observation. It could be suggested that future screening studies also include these frequencies to identify signs of ototoxi- city. As mentioned in the introduction to this thesis, platinum based chemotherapy af- fects the higher frequencies (8 kHz and above) first. This mi xed-method study strength- ened the evidence for this theory. However, only 19 EHF PTAs were carried out, and thus a larger study sample and further research into this area is needed. 4.6. Strength and Limitations To our knowledge, this is the first study resea rching in depth, the specific impacts oto- toxicity has on QoL. Participants were from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds, ages and years since having chemotherapy . Many participants were local to the Nottingham area, participants were from around the UK. However, all participants were white, therefore, the study was not racially representative. It is a common issue with research, 192 specifically clinical trials, not including a representative number of participants from ethnic minorities (Loree et al. 2019) . Further research and more engagement to recruit those from ethnic minorities is needed into how ototoxicity impacts people of different ethnicities . Due to not having access to the participants ' medical records, self -reported medical his- tory was taken . These may not be r eliable, especially in cases where the participants could not recall what type of chemotherapy they received. Thus, their hearing loss could potentially be age or noise exposure related. Furthermore, some participants had re- ceived chemotherapy up to 20 yea rs ago, and thus their experiences may not translate or be relevant for patients currently undergoing treatment. In addition, no baseline hearing test was performed, thus a theoretical normative model was used for the com- parative measure. The EHF -PTA were not carried out in soundproof booths, and alt- hough were carried out in quiet settings, would not be as accurate or reliable as per- forming the test in an audiology clinic. Finally, there were many confounding issues , such as background noise, patient illnes s and concentration, and it is difficult to associ- ate ototoxicity to QoL directly. Adults LWBC face many long -term effects , such as neu- ropathy, that could impact QoL, and these must be considered when using general ques- tionnaires identifying how a side eff ect influences daily life. However, by interviewing the participants about their specific experiences, a more direct association can be seen between ototoxicity and how this impacts QoL. Mixed -methods studies are a valuable approach into novel areas of re search. The statistical analysis from this study suggests there is a relationship between QoL and ototoxicity, and the interviews gave insight into why this could be. 193 4.7. Conclusions The key themes developed from this mixed -methods study identify the current issues adults face when experiencing chemotherapy -induced ototoxicity. The EHF PTA suggest that there is a statistically significant difference in those who have undergone chemo- therapy compared to their age and gender matched norm, especially at the higher fre- quencies. From the interviews, more awareness is needed surrounding ototoxic effects and the impact this has on QoL. Specifically, social QoL and the fear and anxiety associ- ated with the lack of awareness must be addressed when managing ototoxic sympto ms. Furthermore, the experiences with clinicians have a major role in determining whether people receive guidance and support for their symptoms. Clinical staff that do not en- gage, refer or offer support can have a negative impact on the QoL of their patie nts, compared to those that listen and offer guidance, even without a referral to Audiology. However, an optimal way to prevent this reduction in QoL would be regular ototoxicity monitoring. This way, early detection of hearing loss and tinnitus could be e nsured, and support would be offered before impacting QoL. This study identified key themes and issues surround chemotherapy -induced ototoxi- city, which holds potential for future research. More support is needed for those experi- encing this late effect, inc luding increased awareness, improved clinical attitudes to- wards ototoxicity and referrals to audiology. Furthermore, information tools such as apps and leaflets may not be the most effective way of informing everyone about ototox- icity, and thus, a more per sonalised approach should be considered when informing pa- tients of side effects. 194 Identifying the prevalence and severity of ototoxicity in adults liv- ing with and beyond cancer: a cross -sectional study 5.1. Background and Rationale Ototoxi city can impact communication with family and friends, but also can impact clin- ical experiences. For example, e xperiencing an auditory impairment can significantly impact communication with health care providers. Communication about treatment op- tions and pathways is a fundamental component to patient care and positive treatment outcomes . A lack of clear communication may cause confusion regarding the nature of a patient's treatment journey (Edwards 2020) . It is reported that ototoxicity affects between 24% and 79% of adults treated with plati- num based chemotherapy , although the literature varies as shown in Chapter 2. (Theunissen et al. 2014; Frisina et al. 2016) . The evidence surrounding the prevalence typically relies on patient self -report outcomes, often where ototoxicity is grouped to- gether as one symptom, rat her than separated into hearing, tinnitus and vestibulotoxi- city. Furthermore, patient reported outcomes are highly subjective, with no widely im- plemented guideline s specifying what is considered clinically significant (Waissbluth et al. 2017) . It is estimated that in the year 2040, cancer survivors between 65 -74 year s old will ac- count for 24% of su rvivors, 75 -84 year s olds will account for 31% of survivors and those 85 and older contribute to 18% of survivors (Edwards 2020) . Adults, therefore, are soon to be accountable for most of the cancer survivorship population. The preva- lence of age -related hearing lo ss or presbycusis, and tinnitus, also increase with age (Jafari et al. 2019; Oosterloo et al. 2020) . Thus, medical professionals must consider the 195 multiple increased risks in this population. However, little has been done to research the relationship between hearing and c ancer treatment in adults, despite both being high risk in this age group. 5.2. Aims and Objectives The purpose of this study was to identify the prevalence and extent of long -term ototox- icity in adults LWBC 0-5 years following from their first treatment with platinum based chemotherapy and whether this impacts QoL. The mixed -methods study in Chapter 4. explored into how and why adults LWBC were impacted by ototoxicity, but the preva- lence and severity of those undergoing chemotherapy is yet to be determined. Objectives for this study included identifying the type and severity of hearing loss, if any, in adults LWBC following platinum based chemotherapy and th e prevalence and se- verity of tinnitus using a validated questionnaire. Furthermore, to explore the feasibility of the use of EHF audiometry testing in this population to detect ototoxicity. We hypoth- esised that there will be an association between the presence of ototoxicity and a reduc- tion of QoL in this population. 5.3. Methods 5.3.1. Outline of Methods This study was designed as a cross -sectional observational study to screen for ototoxi- city in adults LWBC at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust . A cross -sectional study design typically measures both an outcome and an exposure simultaneously, based on a set of eligibility criteria. This study design is typically used to identify prevalence of diseases and does not involve follow -up measurement (Setia 196 2016) . Clinicians in the oncology departments identified potentially eligible partici- pants, which were then screened against the exclusion criteria. Following obtaining informed consent, demographic information was collected . An otoscope examination was performed to check f or any signs of audiological damage to the ear, such as infection or excessive ear wax. A PTA, following an extended high -fre- quency audiogram was then performed using the Callisto AC440 Portable High -fre- quency Audiometer. Furthermore, the three following validated questionnaires were completed by the participants: HHIA: Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults OR HHIE: Hearing Handicap Inven- tory for the Elderly. THI: Tinnitus Handicap Inventory. SF-36: 36 -Item Short Form Survey. The three validated questionn aires (THI, HHIA/HHIE and SF -36) were statistically The audiogram results were analysed using GraphPad Prism v8. This study was designed and developed alongside a Public and Participant Involvement (PPI) representative. The Partici pant Information Sheets (PIS), including any recruit- ment information was deemed appropriate and relevant for the target population by the PPI representative. 5.3.2. Ethical Considerations The study received favourable opinion from the Office for Research Ethics Committees Northern Ireland (ORECNI) reference 19/NI/0165 on 21st August 2019, and the Health 197 Research Authority (HRA) approval was obtained on the 23rd of September 2019. Con- firmation of capacity and capability for NUH NHS Trust was received on the 2nd of Feb- ruary 2020 and for Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust on the 16th of Oc- tober 2019. A substantial amendment was approved on the 10th of January 2020 to add Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust as a recruitment site . 5.3.3. PPI The protocol, PIS and informed consent documents were drafted and sent out to PPI representatives via email for feedback. Edits were made and a PPI representative dis- cussed further feedback, ideas and comments in person with the research team. The P PI representative is an adult cancer survivor who experiences ototoxicity from cisplatin and his insights were invaluable. 5.3.4. Recruitment Clinical oncologists identified potentially eligible participants during their oncology fol- low-up appointments, at both the germ cell clinic and the gynae cological clinics. The participants were then checked against the exclusion criteria, given the participant in- formation sheets and the study was explained to them, with opportunities to ask any questions. 5.3.5. Eligibility Crit eria Once the potentially eligible participants were identified by their clinicians, they were then checked against the eligibility criteria. 198 Inclusion criteria consisted of: Ability to give informed consent Age 18+ at the time of cancer diagnosis Treat ed with at least 1 cycle of platinum based chemothera py (typically cisplatin, carboplatin or oxaliplatin) Had received their first platinum based chemotherapy 0-5 years prior Comprehensive understanding of the English language Exclusion criteria consisted of: Previous radiotherapy to the head and neck area Pre-existing known hearing deficits excluding age -related hearing loss, such as noise induced hearing loss and cochlear implants. 5.3.6. Data Collection 5.3.6.1. Informed Consent Potentially eligible participants were then checked against the exclusion criteria, given the participant information sheets and the study was explained to them, with opportu- nities to ask any questions. It was explained to the potential participant that entry into the study is entirely voluntary and that their treatment and care will not be affected by their decision. It was also explained that they could withdraw at any time, but attempts would be made to avoid this occurrence. In the event of their withdrawal, it wa s ex- plained that their data collected so far cannot be erased and we will seek consent to use the data in the final analyses where appropriate. Following this, if the participant wished to partake in the research, informed consent was taken by mysel f and/or the 199 CRN staff. The process for obtaining participant informed consent was in accordance with the REC guidance, and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements. The informed consent form was then signed and dated by the participant and the person taking con- sent before they entered the trial. 5.3.6.2. Questionnaires The questionnaires were distributed to the participant to complete during the study. These questionnaires were the same as those in Chapter 4. Page 141 , except the demo- graphic questionnaire. In the event a participant did not know their chemotherap y, their medical notes were obtained by their clinical team, with the participants' consent. The questionnaires, other than the basic demographic questionnaire, are all validated with retest reliability, and 95% confidence intervals (Nordvik 1999) . Demographic Questionnaire: A questionnaire asking basic person demographic and socioeconomic information. This included date of birth, marital status, edu- cational level, nationality, gender and employment status. A further few ques- tions were a sked about their cancer, treatment, type and stage of cancer diagno- sis (if known), treatment (if known) and dose. Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults/Elderly (HHIA/HHIE): These question- naires involve 25 items which identifies the problems hearing loss m ay cause without the use of a hearing aid. Each item can be classed into two sub -groups, Emotional and Situational Hearing Handicap. The questionnaires are scored from 0-100, with 100 being the highest handicap (Newman et al. 1990; Weinstein et al. 1986; Ventry, Weinstein 1982) . 200 Tinnitus Handicap Inven tory (THI): This questionnaire, introduced by Newman et.al (1996) was designed to assess the impact of tinnitus in daily life. This ques- tionnaire involves 25 items which identifies, quantifies and evaluates the experi- enced difficulties due to tinnitus (Newman et al. 1996; Newman et al. 1998) . 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF -36) Items: This questionnaire consists of 36 items , which measurers the QoL , relying on patient self -reports. The question- naire consists of 8 subcategories: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limita- tions due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emo- tional problems, emotiona l well -being, social functioning, energy/fatigue and general health perceptions. 5.3.6.3. Extended High -Frequency Audiometry Similar to in Chapter 4. an otoscope examination was performed on all participants prior to their hearing test, to check for any signs of audiological damage to the ear, such as an infection or excessive ear wax. Following this a PTA followed by extended high - frequency pure test audi ometry (EHF -PTA) was carried out using a portable device named The Callisto, connected to a university -networked and secure laptop . Further- more, additional safety checks were carried out by Medical Equipment Safety Unit (MESU ) at NUH NHS Trust . The gold -standard British Society of Audiology (BSA) guidelines were followed on how to perform PTA, and an SOP and further protocol were written for the additional higher frequencies tested in this study (British Society of Audiology n.d.) . Clear instructions 201 were given to participants about the hearing test, and they were asked if they under- stood and had any questions. Participants were asked about tinnitus at the time of the audiometry. Information given was as follows: \"I am going to test your hearing by measuring the quietest sounds that you can hear. As soon as you hear a sound (tone), press the button. Keep it pressed for as long as you hear the sound (tone), no matter which ear you hear it in. Release the button as soon as you no longer hear the sound (tone). Whatever the sound, and no matter how faint the sound, press the button as soon as you think you hear it, and release it as soon as you think it stops.\" (Kutz 2018) Following this protocol, the PTA began by assessing the participants' reported better hearing ear at 1 kHz at a clearly audible 40 dB HL. This ensures the participant is famil- iar with the tones and knows when to respond. If there is no respons e, the loudness is increased by 10 dB HL until a response occurs, or until 80 dB HL is reached. In this case, increased the loudness by 5 dB HL and monitor the participants for any signs of discom- fort. Following this, frequencies were tested at 2 kHz, 4 kH z, 8 kHz, 500 Hz and 250 Hz for both ears. The higher frequencies were tested at 10 kHz, 12.5 kHz, 14 kHz and 16 kHz. Frequencies were re -tested at 1 kHz to detect any variance in 2018; Baguley et 2015; Tanaka et al. 2018) . Eligible participants often participated in the study whilst wa iting for their follow -up appointment, or after it. Thus, time constraints meant that not all frequencies could be tested. A priority was given to the higher frequencies (8 kHz -16 kHz), and then from 1 kHz - 6 kHz). 5.3.7. Data Analysis 202 5.3.7.1. Questionnaires The preva lence of ototoxicity reported in the largest trial to date was used to estimate the sample size for this study (Frisina et al. 2016) . A sample size of 93 participants was estimated assuming a prevalence of 40%, marginal error of 10% and a confidence level of 95%. There was no dropout rate in this study as there is only one appointment in- volved. The hearing loss was analysed using the audiogram, with the handicap caused by the hearing loss analysed using the questionnaires. As tinnitus is a subjective symptom, it was identified by analysing the questio nnaire. The questionnaires are all scored from 0 -100 and therefore, were analysed as continu- ous data. The results of each questionnaire were pooled to obtain either the mean (SD) or median [IQR] dependent on whether the data were normally distributed. Thi s was assessed by observing histograms and Normal Q -Q plots of the data and tested using the Kolmogorov -Smirnov test. The tinnitus prevalence (obtained from the THI) was pre- sented as a proportion with 95% confidence interval. These analyses, in addition to the data collected, were all carried out on a University of Nottingham computer, which is password protected and on the University of Notting- ham network. This was only accessible by the research team and no other persons had access to the analysis or raw data. Furthermore, all data files were password protected and/or encrypted. 5.3.7.2. Extended High -Frequency Audiometry The prevalence and severity of ototoxicity was analysed using the multiple grading sys- tems available. As there is no standardised grading system, the results were analysed 203 using the multiple scales to see how this impacts the results. For example, the National Cancer Institute Criteria, the American Speech Hearing Language Association criteria and the World Health Org anisation criteria were each analysed using an ordinal logistic regression model (Waissbluth et al . 2017) . The prevalence of ototoxicity was identified using the audiogram results and the BSA guidelines and was presented as a proportion with a 95% confidence interval. The pres- ence of ototoxicity, defined as \"the presence of hearing loss and/or tinni tus assumed to be caused by an ototoxic medication ( i.e., platinum based chemotherapy ),\" was statisti- cally analysed using a binary logistic regression with adjustment for confounding fac- tors. The data were stored on OtoAccess, a database designed for the AC440 software, and exported manually onto a Microsoft Excel File. The Excel File contai ned all participant numbers, gender, age and their maximum threshold. Normative data w ere calculated using the British Standard statistical model, using the following equations to estimate an age and gender matched median value (BS EN ISO 7029:2017 2017; Jilek et al. 2014) . These formulae were d eveloped by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), a worldwide federation of national standard bodies. The third edition, published in 2017, was used to calculate frequencies 0.25 kHz to 12.5 kHz, however frequencies 14 kHz and 16 kHz we re derived from a paper, pub- lished in 2014, based on the second edition, which has since been technically revised. However, due to the lack of data for 14 kHz and 16 kHz in the third edition, this re- mained the most recent standard (Jilek et al. 2014; BS EN ISO 7029:2017 2017) . H1=(Y18) 204 Equati on 4: to be used for frequencies 0.25 kHz to 8 kHz, where H1 is the median value, in decibels (dB HL), where Y is age in years, and where and are dimensionless quan- tities, found in the statistical distribution of hearing thresh olds related to age and gen- der (ISO 7029:2017) (BS EN ISO 7029:2017 2017) . H2=(Y22) Equation 5: to be used for frequencies 10 kHz and 12.5 kHz, where 2 is the median value, in dB HL and is age in years. The coefficie nt and the exponent for males and females are found in the statistical distribution of hearing thresholds related to age and gender (ISO 7029:2017) (BS EN ISO 7029:2017 2017) . H3=(Y18)1.5 Equation 6: to be used for fre quencies 14 kHz and 16 kHz, where 3 is the median value, in dB Hl and is age in years. The gender independent coefficient can be found in Jilek et al. (2014) . Once the age and gender matched normative data w ere calculated for all participants, using Microsoft Excel, the estimated thresholds were checked against the Callisto Au- diometer maximum thresholds. Any calculated threshold above the Callisto threshold was changed to match that of the Callisto . This was done, not only for practical reasons to reduce any statistical bias, but to ensure the results could be clinically replicable. For example, a 75 -year -old male, at 14 kHz would be expected to hear at a median threshold of 137 dB HL. However, the Callisto audiometer can only present pure tones at 14 kHz up to 80 dB HL. It would be clinically impractical to compare these two thresholds when 137 dB HL cannot be measured by audiometers. Furthermore, for participants who did 205 not here at the maximum t hreshold for any one frequency, and therefore a measure- ment could not be taken, 10 dB HL was added to the maximum threshold of the fre- quency. 5.4. Results 5.4.1. Ethical Considerations Ethical approval was granted by the Office for Research Ethics Committees Northern Ireland (RECNI) on the 20th of August 2019 (Ref: 19/NI/0165) and HRA and Health and Care Research Wales approval was accepted on the 23rd of September 2019. An amend- ment was submitted to the protocol, which was accepted on the 10th of January 2020. Confir mation of Capacity was granted by NUH on the 18th of February 2020. 5.4.2. Recruitment and Sample Size A sample size of 93 participants was estimated assuming a prevalence of 40%, marginal error of 10% and a confidence level of 95%. However due to the time restr aints, a tem- porary physical injury and the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic, 7 participants were recruited to this study between 3rd March 2020 and 16th March 2020. The study was then suspended by the research team due to the increased risk to cancer patients du ring COVID -19, and then the government due to lockdown guidelines. Assuming a preva- lence of 40% and a confidence level of 95%, the marginal error was 35% and thus in- creased the likelihood of a Type II error. Potential participants were approached by their oncologists. Potential participants included any adults who had been treated with their first platinum based chemotherapy 0-5 years prior. Five patients were recruited from the Germ Cell Clinic, and 2 participants were recruited from the Gynae cological Clinic. 206 The mean age for participants was 50.29 years old, (SD 11.47) and ranged from 38 to 65. From the 7 participants, 5 (71.4%) were male. Most were married (57.1%) and had completed high school (42.9%). Furthermore, 6 participants were British and employ ed (85.7%), seen in Table 17.

Questionnaire Results Using SPSS v26, normality was assessed using histograms followed by the Shapiro - Wilks test for each subcategory in the questionnaires. Monocentric relationships be- tween the questionnaires and their subcategories were observed using scatter plots. The descr iptive analyses are displayed in Table 19.

Using the consensus scoring of tinnitus severity, this population would be considered as having slight or no tinnitus handicap (Newman et al. 1998; Newman et al. 1996; Fackrell et al. 2016) . Using the consensus scoring of hearing handicap, this populatio n would be considered of having no handicap (Hays et al. 1995) . Individual scores were also consid- ered, seen in Table 20. Using the baseline mean values f rom the Medical Outcomes Study SF-36, scores were considered below average, average or above average (Hemphill 2003) .General Health 47.5 30-71.25 10-75 (65) 209 Participant Number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 THI Mild handicap Mild handicap Moderate handi- cap Slight or no handicap Mild handicap Slight or no handicap Slight or no handicap HHIA Emotional No handicap No handicap Mild -mode rate handicap No handicap Mild -moderate handicap No handicap No handicap HHIA Situational No handicap No handicap Mild -moderate handicap No handicap Significant handi- cap No handicap Mild -moderate handicap HHIA Total No handicap No handi cap Mild -moderate handicap No handicap Significant handi- cap No handicap Mild -moderate handicap SF-36 Physical Func- tioning Above average Above average Above average Average Above average Above average Above average SF-36 Limitations Phys- ical Above average Above average Above average Above average Below average Above average Below average SF-36 Limi tations Emo- tional Above average Above average Above average Above average Average Above average Above average SF-36 Energy Average Average Above average Below average Below average Average Average SF_36 Wellbeing Average Average Above average Below average Below average Below average Above average 210 SF-36 Social Above average Above average Above average Average Below average Average Above average SF-36 Pain Above average Above average Above avera ge Below average Above average Average Above average SF-36 General Health Below average Below average Above average Below average Average Average Above average Table 20 displays the individual outcome scores for each subcategory within the questionnaires, for each participant. 211 A correlation analysis was performed to examine the relationship between tinnitus, hearing loss and QoL using the questionnaires, seen in Figure 25. Though all statistical analysis from this study should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size, QoL related pain was found to be strongly and positively correlated to THI (r = 0.936, p = 0.002) and HHIA/HHIE emotional (r = 0.9, p = 0.005) and total (r = 0.9, p = 0.005), and QoL general health was found to be strongly correlated with HHIA situa- 0.39 1.00THI HHIAE Emotional HHIAE Situational HHIA Total SF Physical Functioning SF Limitations Physical SF Limitations Emotional SF Energy SF Wellbeing SF Social SF Pain SF General Health THI HHIAE Emotional HHIAE Situational HHIA Total SF Physical Functioning SF Limitations Physical SF Limitations Emotional SF Energy SF Wellbeing SF Social SF Pain SF General Health-1.0-0.500.51.0 Figure 25 displays a heatmap of the correlations between the questionnaire sub- categories. 212 5.4.4. High -Frequency Audiometry Results A total of 7 participants had a complete EHF PTA. Results from the EHF -PTA were into Excel . Once the data were col- lected and the normative maximum thresholds were adjusted, the table was exported into GraphPad Prism v8 for analysis. The mean and standa rd deviation for each partici- pant was calculated and plotted to observe any visual differences between the thresh- olds, seen in Figure 26. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7020406080100 Participant NumberdB HLLeft Ear Max Thresholds Right Ear Max ThresholdsNormative Max Thresholds Figure 26 displays the mean and SD maximum thresholds, in dB HL, for each ear per participant across all frequencies. To identify the presence of ototoxicity, a one -way repeated measures ANOVA with a Bonferroni post -hoc correction was carried out be- tween the left ear maximum thresholds, right ear maximum thresholds and normative 213 maximum thresholds for each participant. As seen in Table 21, all participants had sta- tistically significant differences between at least one ear and their gender, age matched normative thresholds. However, only participants 4, 5, 6 and 7 had statistically signifi- cant thresholds in both ears, which is the typical presentation of ototoxic -related hear- ing loss.

Finally, the current ototoxic grading systems were compared against the participants' EHF PTA results. The current guidelines are displayed in Chapter 1. page 49 and are re- peated below in Table 22. These represent the most common grading systems for m oni- toring or measuring ototoxicity following platinum based chemotherapy 2018; Crundwell et al. 2016; Kornak 2019; Theunissen et al. 2014; ASHA 1994) . 214 Population Purpose Classification Parameters ASHA Individuals receiv- ing cochleotoxic drug therapy Identify Cochleotoxicity from serial audiometry Binary yes/no based on changes from baseline. 10 dB change from baseline at 2 consecutive frequencies, or, 20 dB change at 1 -frequency, or loss of response w here one was previously obtained.

All the participants were found to have no or mild ototoxicity. However, according to the ASHA criteria all would be diagnosed in having ototoxicity , shown in Table 23. Table 23 displays the different classifications each participant would receive de- pending on the grading system. 5.5. Discussion Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the study was suspended and finally closed perma- nently. The study followed all government and NHS guidelines b efore the suspension re- garding participant recruitment and testing. However, once the oncology departments altered their follow -up clinics to telephone consultations and face to face research was suspended, it was decided to close this cross -sectional stud y. This study was suspended before reaching its recruitment target, thus would need many more participants to be considered statistically powerful. Statistical analysis was performed as planned, all re- sults should be interpreted with caution.

Participants were also enthusiastic about taking part in a cross -sectional research study. Many participants were waiting for other appointments or check -ups and were told to wait for around 30 minutes, thus taking part in a short cross -sectional study filled in their time. However, the sample this study recruited would not necessa rily be representative of all cancer patients in the East Midlands and South Yorkshire. For example, the majority of participants were employed (85.7%), men (71.4%), with a mean age of 50, married (57.1%) and were white British (85.7%) who have high school education (42.9%). Com- paring this to the demographic information found in Nottingham, where ~52% of the population is male, and 35% of the population is from a BAME group, this study is far from representative of the population (Office for National Statistics 2020) . Furthermore, participants were recruited from the Germ Cell Clinic twice and the Gynae Clinic once. Therefore, with additional time the sample may have become more representative. Sim- ilarly, the type of cancers and treatments the participants received, although were all platinum based chemotherapy , did not include oxaliplatin. A wider variety of cancer types and treatments would have enabled an in -depth analysis into the prevalence and characteristics of ototoxicity and QoL . In total, 4 participants had tinnitus and 3 had no tinnitus at the time of the study. From those that experienced tinnitus, only one participant reported moderate tinnitus handi- cap as reported by THI. However, this individual also had an above average QoL in all 218 areas, suggesting their tinnitus did not have an impact on the QoL. Furthermore, 5 par- ticipants had self -reported hearing handicap and 2 did not. Only one participant re- ported significant hearing handicap. This participant also had moderate tinnitus handi- cap and below average QoL in physical limitations, energy, wellbeing, social and pain. Thus, this suggests both tinnitus and hearing handicap can impact QoL. Though, clinical assumptions cannot be assumed in this study due to the lack of participants recruited. By exploring the various ototoxicity grading systems, the participants in this study ex- perienced a mild ototoxicity, however, for the most part, self -reported an above -average QoL. Th us, support pathways must consider the impact on QoL in this population. All participants would be diagnosed with ototoxicity by following the ASHA guidelines, de- spite on participant self -reporting no handicap with tinnitus or hearing loss. Further- more, al l other grading systems had various categories rather than a binary system. This detects specific severities and could potentially improve the type and urgency of audiol- ogy support a patient may need. However, a clear pathway or process must be put in plac e, such as a need for audiology referral. Using these grading systems without a plan in place would still allow for the same diagnoses receiving different care and treatment. Ideally, adults should be encouraged to monitor their audiological health through audi- ology appointments. Similarly, to the adult population in the UK being encouraged to have regular eye checks at the opticians, regular audiometry could be carried out in the adult populatio n. This would mean in the event of a patient undergoing ototoxic medica- tion, an additional baseline hearing tests would not be necessary and appropriate measures could be put in place earlier to monitor any progression in hearing loss. Older adults who experience early signs of presbyacusis should be encouraged to monitor 219 their audiological health through audiology clinics. Theoretically, this could serve as a baseline measure prior to beginning any ototoxic medication and be part of thei r regu- lar health check. However, this is not always the case. As mentioned previously, high -frequency hearing loss can be easily measured and could prove key to detecting early signs of both age -related hearing loss and ototoxicity. The accuracy of high -frequency audiometry has been debated amongst clinicians and re- searchers due to arguments about reliability and sensitivity of the technology used (Mehrparvar et al. 2018; Hunter et al. 2020) . A meta -analys is found that there was a larger mean difference between high -frequency audiometry and conventional fre- quency audiometry overall, however this was not statistically significant in age subcate- gories (Mehrparvar et al. 2018) . Furthermore, this meta -analys is compared those with noise -related exposure to those without. Thus, cannot be directly compared to the dam- age caused by ototoxic medication. There is potential for high -frequency audiometry to be valuable in diagnosing early signs of ototoxicity (Macc\u00e0 et al. 2015; Sulaiman et al. 2014; Hunter et al. 2020) . For example, one study showed that 81 of 157 ears (52%) when tested, did indeed have EHF hearing loss (>25 dB HL ) for at least one tested fre- quency (Hunter et al. 2020) 5.6. Strengths and Limitations There are many strengths to this study, despite having been impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. Cross -sectional studies are an inexpensive and relatively quick type of study, which gain novel insights and findings without using additional participant time. This study lasted approximately 30 minutes and recruited participant s during their waiting periods between appoi ntments . Information about feasibility, attitudes towards hearing 220 tests during clinics and prevalence would be achieved. Thus, potential future research could involve screening interventions, identifying the preva lence and exploring the dif- ferent ototoxicity monitoring systems and pathways for patients who suffer from oto- toxicity to get the right support. For example, a full PTA may not be performed due to time restraints, yet key frequencies can be tested in a sho rt period of time. Moreover, the results from the EHF -PTA should be interpreted with caution, as they took place in a quiet setting, not a soundproof room. For the purposes of identifying early signs of oto- toxicity to identify a need for audiology referral s, this setting was appropriate. Due to the premature closure of this study because of the COVID -19 pandemic, it is diffi- cult to assess the evidence and findings of this research scientifically and accurately . For example, the correlational analysis perfor med on the questionnaires should be inter- preted with caution, as the sample size is too small to draw any scientific conclusions, despite statistical significance. Future research must adapt to new socially distant ways of carrying out clinical studies. This is difficult as hearing tests require to be physically close to a participant's face, this could be an opportunity to explore different means of detecting ototoxicity. For exam- ple, online questionnaires could be completed by cancer patients un dergoing treatment, similarly to the current questionnaires that identify side effects, but including tinnitus and hearing loss as separate effects, and how this impacts an individual's QoL. This type of research design could be developed as a longitudinal study, to identify the change in side effects and how they impact QoL over time, or from the transition between patient and survivor. Another adaptation to this study would be by the participants testing their 221 own hearing using a self -test device, either by their usual care team or on a smart de- vice , such as a tablet or mobile phone. This could be less reliable for non-audiologists carrying out and interpreting the assessments , it would reduce the risks from COVID -19 as the researcher would not ne ed to meet face to face with the participant. Instead, a website or an app could be designed that tracked a person's self-test results, self -re- ported outcomes and QoL and thus, the researcher could identify any possible trends. Due to the time constraints , these adaptations could not be performed for this specific study, however there are opportunities for future research to further develop these con- cepts. Although, due to the one-time measurement and lack of follow -up, or baseline, it is diffi- cult to conc lude or derive any significant relationships from the analysis. This is a limi- tation of the cross -sectional study design, as is the risk of biases and over -interpreting associations and correlations which may not be from a direct cause (Setia 2016) . 5.7. Conclusion Due to the lack of participants in this study, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions from the data. I t found participants' perceptions of handicap during chemotherapy fol- low-up is mild and does not clinically impact their QoL . However, using the EHF -PTA and comparing the audiogram results to an age and gender -matched value, all partici- pants had a statistically significant hearing loss, at least in one ear. From the seven par- ticipants included in this study, four participants had a statistically significant hearing loss in both ears accord . Using the ototoxicity grading systems, they would all be scored differently and most would be diagnosed as having low -grade ototoxicity, despite all needing some support. This study concludes that w hen assessing QoL and handicap, 222 most participants reported a mild ototoxicity but an above average QoL , suggesting mild ototoxicity does not impact QoL in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy , but most adults undergoing chemotherapy experience some form of ototoxicity . 223 Investigating the acceptability of using self -test and extended high - frequency audiometry for monitoring ototoxicity in people living with and be- yond cancer: online surveys of clinicians and patients. 6.1. Background and Rationale The documentation of results in Chapter 6 is difficult to follow and in parts feels exces- sive, with scope to be more concise. In particular you display a lot of information about the demographics of your participants but I am not sure what con clusions you can draw from this. In parts it is not clear how the results displayed link to the research question or conclusions. Focus on providing data that helps to answer the research question. Re- visit the conclusion from this chapter and check that yo u can justify your conclusions with the findings you have. Linking your findings to the theory you have presented around 'acceptability' would be interesting. UK v worldwide opinions, also the use of \"trust\" is vague and not validated so a pretty loaded and bias opinion. Also need to make clearer how the survey was developed and explain that self -test specifically meant on a mobile app and describe the picture posted. Following the suspension of the cross -sectional study due to the COVID -19 pandemic, an opportunity arose to focus on a research question that evolved from both the systematic review and clinical observations experienced when recruiting for the patient -facing studies. In particular, the heterogeneous results from the sys tematic review in Chapter 2. and the interviews in Chapter 4. showed that variations in practice raised the issue of patients receiving different levels of ca re. There is a great need for a standardised oto- toxicity monitoring program that is acceptable and feasible for audiologists and adults 224 LWBC. In order to investigate these issues, two online surveys were developed to inves- tigate the acceptability of self -test and high -frequency hearing tests in ototoxicity moni- toring programmes in clinicians and patients. Evidence of implementation of ototoxic ity monitoring is variable and sparse in practice in both the UK and internationally (Maru, Malky 2018a; Brittz et al. 2019; Phillips, Bell 2001) . For example, there are no mandatory baseline hearing tests carried out nation- ally in the UK. Furthermore, a patient could be diagnosed as having a mild ototoxicity using one grading system, and severe ototoxicity using another , as shown in Chapter 5. Subsequently, this means patients would receive different types of support whilst expe- riencing the same symptoms. This creates a system where some people LWBC are being over diagnosed with ototoxicity, and others being unde rdiagnosed depending on which clinic they attend, which area they live in and what grading system is used. Despite these inconsistencies in grading systems, there is the issue that many people LWBC that are not informed of the risks of ototoxicity at all. Many factors contribute to these differences in patient care. Measuring people's hearing at a baseline level in addition to all other baseline measurements needed before treat- ment could be both physically and mentally exhausting for the patient. Audiometr y re- quires concentration and could be mentally straining for those with additional stress from their cancer diagnosis . There may be limited resources, time or space available in clinics to carry out additional tests. Thus, it may not be feasible to monitor one's hearing through their treatment process . However, it can also be argued that it is in the patient's best interest and thus duty of care to monitor their hearing, as once a patient experi- ences ototoxicity but no baseline audiometry was carried out , it is difficult to assess a 225 change in hearing . Using faster screening assessments may increase the feasibility of ototoxicity monitoring. Though, successful implementation of a new service or interven- tion does not solely rely on the feasibility, but the com bination of feasibility and accept- ability. The acceptability of a service identifies how appropriate it would be to those involved. In this situation it would be to both patients undergoing ototoxic treatment and the healthcare professionals carrying out the audiological monitoring . The acceptability of a study is typically acknowledged when designing interventions, it is rarely evaluated. For example, the ototoxicity monitoring programme proposed by ASHA represents in the- ory, an ideal monitoring service (Paken et al. 2017) . ASHA guidelines involve a baseline assessment including otoscopy, PTA and patient counselling. Follow -up appointments either following each cycle of cisplatin, or every 2 -4 cycles of carboplatin are enco ur- aged until the patient moves on to a post -chemotherapy follow -up regime. This involves audiometry monitoring at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months to ensure optimal audiological rehabili- tation is carried out (Paken et al. 2017) . However, the monitoring protocol may not be acceptable for clinical, financial, and geographical reasons. When adults LWBC may have many other appointments to attend whilst undergoing chemotherapy, these additional tests may not be acceptable or feasible t o them . Both patient and clinical opinions can potentially influence how successful an interven- tion is. Most studies evaluating an intervention currently focus on the feasibility of a product or service, however little is known about evaluating acceptabili ty and how ac- ceptability can influence the success of implementation. There is little guidance on how 226 to define and assess acceptability (Sekhon et al. 2017a) . Though, a recent systematic re- view defined acceptability as \"a multi -faceted construct that reflects the extent to which people delivering or receiving a healthcare intervention consider it to be appropriate, base d on anticipated or experienced cognitive and emotional responses to the interven- tion\" (Sekhon et al. 2017b) . Thus, i t is fair to assum e both professional and patient view- points on of a service are equally important in evaluating acceptability. Furthermore, if an intervention is not widely accepted by either healthcare professionals or patients, this could impact the feasibility and overa ll success of the service. A study used qualitative methods to explore the perspectives of four clinicians on an ototoxicity monitoring programme (Garinis et al. 2018b) . The study both chemotherapy -induced and aminoglycoside -induced ototoxic ity. It was unanimously agreed that ototoxicity was indeed a clinically significant problem, how- ever they had different opinions on how they would monitor patients. Monitoring pro- grammes that were suggested by the h ealthcare professionals varied , for example eval- uating patients' case -by-case, carrying out mass baseline testing within weeks of the pa- tients' first treatment with regular follow -ups, or monitoring patients just before treat- ment and after their treatment had ended. Furthermore, one clinician stated that it was not within their practise to mention ototoxicity risk even routinely with their patients. Another clinician mentioned that they received complaints of hearing loss but as they had no baseline to comp are the current audiogram with, they felt they did not offer opti- mal patient care. The study mentioned the importance of having an audiologist as part of a patient's care was not only for the patient's benefit, but to raise awareness of oto- toxicity within the clinical community. The clinicians interviewed stated \"in cases where hearing loss or tinnitus interferes with daily activities, you feel compelled to lower their 227 dose, but no guidelines exist on how much lowering and we don't have good consensus on ho w to modify the dose based on changes in hearing tests. We need audiologists to help guide these decisions .\" When asked about why certain clinics have not imple- mented standard screening protocols, answers varied between challenges with re- sources, staffing, appointment timing, cost, space and that often ototoxicity is not seen as important as other long -term toxicities and thus requires less attention. The field of ototoxicity monitoring is progress, however. A nother study recommended a monitoring protocol involving the distortion product otoacoustic emission measure- ments (DPOAEs). DPOAE tests are typically used for new -born hearing screening can be measured in less than a minute ((ASHA) n.d.; Garinis et al. 2018b) . The test is performed by placing a sma ll probe containing a microphone and speaker into the patient's ear, which when presenting two pure tone frequencies, measures the sounds generated by the OHC vibrations within the inner ear. DPOAEs can therefore detect OHC integrity and cochlear function, detecting signs of cochlear damage and subsequently diagnose hear- ing loss (Abdala, Visser -Dumont 2001) . In theory, this test could detect any early -onset chemotherapy induced ototoxic ity as cisplatin is found to primarily impact OHC mobil- ity. In summary, DPOAEs would be taken at a baseline and then following each cycle of chemotherapy. In the absence of standardised guidelines, and re -iterating what was in- dicated by the clinicians abov e about, the study found unclear what warranted an audio- logical follow -up (McMillan et al. 2013) . Despite these scientifically sound attempts to develop evidence -based ototoxicity moni- toring proposals, there is little evidence to suggest implementation of these guidelines. 228 A UK -based online survey carried out in 2018 found that 72% of overall hearing ser- vices reported an absence of ototoxicity man agement protocols, in addition to inconsist- encies monitoring referral pathways (Maru, audiologists, , though ENTs, GPs, speech and language therapists and community audiology paediatricians also took part. For example, results showed only 16% reported carrying out baseline h earing tests before their patients were treated with ototoxic treatment. Furthermore, when asked about referral pathways, the Audiologists main source of referral was from ENT specialists (67%), for ENTs it was from GPs (71%), and for GPs it was ENTs and A udiologists (40%). This indicates how some patients can find themselves in a referral loop, in addition to resources and time from clinicians not being used effectively. Finally, when asked about the decision to fol- low up or referrals, there is great varia bility across the UK and therefore, the absence of a standardised protocol has an impact on a patients' QoL and clinical resources (Maru, Malky 2018a) . Previous studies carried out have also suggested that there is a lack of standardisation when developing and carrying out ototoxicity -specific protocols to monitor platinum based chemotherapy induced hearing loss (Paken et al. 2016; Knight et al. 2005; 2017; et al. 2017; Crundwell et al. 2016) . From this evidence, it is clear that ototoxicity monitoring remains an inconsistent prac- tice. In addition to protocols and guidelines, innovative technology , such as self -test devices, has been developed for the specific use of ototoxicity monitoring, with validation and feasibility studies all resulting in promising findings (Brittz et al. 2019; Brungart et al. 2018; Yeung 2015; Saliba et al. 2017) . Self -tests involve a person carrying out their 229 own hearing test, either through a website, a smart phone -based app or using other eve- ryday technology. For exampl e, the OtoID system can be used by people LWBC to moni- tor their hearing at home or in a hospital. The OtoID system is a self -test device that measures extended high -frequency pure tone audiometry, from 0.5 to 20kHz. It is spe- cifically designed for ototoxic ity monitoring and detects changes from baseline tests in- dicative of ototoxicity damage. An audiologist trains the patient how to use the device at the baseline test, which involves the device present ing sound intervals and asks the pa- tient if a tone was h eard. The device then guides the patient through a modified Hugh- son-Westlake procedure (Dille et al. 2015; Dille et al. 2012) . The Hughson -Westlake hearing test is the foundation of PTA and involves relying on a patient response, such as pressing a button, to detect an auditory signal. This signal is then repeated, reduced and increased in loudness to identify the quietest sound a person can hear (Bala et al. 2020; Vermiglio et al. 2018) . At follow up, this procedure is repeated but without an audiolo- gist present. Additionally, the device is designed to notify any changes in hearing to cli- nicians so th at the medical team can consider changes in treatment (Jacobs et al. 2012) . Smartphone audiometry with calibrated headphones for use in non -audiology clinical environments is another example of technology developed specifically to detect ototoxi- city. Reliability of the technology was tested in infectious disease clinic s resulting in promising findings for both baseline and follow -up hearing tests (Brittz et al. 2019) . Within the infectious disease clinic, it was found that 88.2% of thresholds corresponded within 10 dB or less between smartphone audiometry and manual audiometry. This technology is not without its limitations, as there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the right ear at 4 and 8 kHz and in the left ear at 2 and 4 kHz between self -test technology and manual audiometry, respectively. 230 Though there is evidence that ototoxicity monitoring can be feasible, when the accepta- bility is evaluated it is important to acknowledge the perspectives of a ll persons in- volved, as although audiologists perform the ototoxicity monitoring, patient referrals fall into the responsibility of the treating clinician (Custer 2019) . There appears to be a presently unknown barrier, somewhere along this pathway between the treating clini- cian and a referral to audiology that prevents this monitoring service from being inter- nationally successful and a long -lasting, standardised service. Moreover, the acceptabil- ity of any health care intervention depends on the evaluation of advantages, disad- vantages and the perceived behavioural barriers of said intervention (Houle et al. 2020) . Typically, measuring acceptability involves evaluating the behaviour towards an intervention, such as adherence, perception, and feelings. Sekhon et.al. proposed a theo- retical framework of acceptability consisting of sev en constructs: affective attitude, bur- den, perceived effectiveness, ethicality, intervention coherence, opportunity costs and self-efficacy (Sekhon et al. 2017b) . From this, it could be argued that the perceived effec- tiveness and opportunity costs are the constructs preventing the success of implement- ing a programme. It is not always the case that audiology and oncology units are in close proximity to one another, or that it would be feasible for someone undergoing chemo- therapy to travel to an audiology department before each chemotherapy cycle. For ex- ample, the audiology centre in Nottingham is in the city centre, a 15 -minute drive away from the oncology department. Using self -testing devices without the need of an audiol- ogist referral may create a problemati c relationship between the two departments, or an audiologist may not completely trust the results from someone who is not clinically trained in carrying out hearing tests. 231 Furthermore, in the event a patient experiences clinically significant ototoxicity, their chemotherapy regime n may be reduced or changed altogether to prevent further dam- age. This risk may not be acceptable to patie nts, who may feel that a monitoring pro- gramme may indirectly impact their survival outcome. The results from Chapter 4. found that this was a common concern for people. In addition to the results from the in- terview studies and the medical literature, it may be that there is not enough perceived importance surrounding hearing changes, compared to other, more acute toxicities. However, acceptabili ty is not static and both clinicians' and patients' opinions may yield differently once they have experienced ototoxicity monitoring and received a ppropriate care (Andryk owski, Manne 2006) . The importance of having a robust baseline hearing test prior to being treated with chemotherapy must be highlighted to both patients and clinicians (Theunissen et al. 2014; ASHA 1994) . Without this baseline hearing test, it can be almost impossible for an audiologist to detect or diagnose any change in hearing, more so in the event of a pa- tient having previous hearing loss from noise exposure or ageing. However, only one pa- tient from the clinical studies carried out had been offered, a baseline hearing test (Chapter 5. ). Having a baseline hearing test would benefit patients, oncologists and au- diologists. Baseline hearing tests followed by regular testing can detect which patients are more likely to be susceptible to ototoxicity , allowing for early discussions to be had about awareness and hearing c hanges before any permanent damage is done or wors- ened. The use of self -test audiometers could potentially help detect early onset ototoxicity in people LWBC without having any additional audiology appointments (Dille et al. 2013) . 232 Using self -test devices would help those concerned about their hearing by not having to wait for appointments to identify any hearing loss. This could lead to people being re- ferred to audiology special ists only when they require further assistance. Additionally , extended high -frequency audiometry could potentially offer a more sensitive test for chemotherapy -induced hearing loss, compared to standard clinical procedures , up to 8 kHz, currently in use (Skalleberg et al. 2020; Theunissen et al. 2015; Sekhon et al. 2017a; Kujansuu et al. 1989) . Including these extended high -frequency threshold s could typically detect earlier signs of ototoxic damage. This would allow for clinical decisions to be made earlier for potential alternatives, to prevent hearing loss in the frequencies critical for speech communication and to allow for optimal rehabili tation measures in the event prevention cannot be avoided. (ASHA 1994) . This testing would potentially detect the earliest signs of ototoxicity, meaning patients and audiologists would not have to wait until the chemotherapy impacts the speech frequencies for interventions to be suggested. Ideally, the effects of ototoxicity could be alleviated either through the use of otoprotec- tive agents or through the development of new, less ototoxic treatments or treatment regimens. Until then, ototoxicity monitoring programmes will play a key role in the management of patients (Brungart et al. 2018) . The information g athered from this sur- vey could potentially be utilised in the deve lopment of an acceptable and feasible oto- toxicity monitoring protocol. 6.2. Aims and Objectives 233 The aim of th ese online survey s was to identify and analyse the acceptability of self -test devices and collect the current opinions of those who would use this devic e. By collect- ing these data, it can ensure the implementation of the self -test devices is appropriate. There are many feasibility studies that have not considered the acceptability of the de- vice, or method, being used (Magro et al. 2020; Kelly et al. 2018) . The survey could therefore help identify the issues found with ototoxicity monitoring by exploring the opinions of both patients and professionals monitoring ototoxicity with self -test devices and result in a potentially evidence -based and cost -effective monitoring service. The aims of this study were to identify: The current opinions and guidance on ototoxicity monitoring in adults living with and beyond cancer. Whether it would be acceptable f or people LWBC to use self -testing devices to track their hearing. Whether hearing professionals would use self -testing devices and/or extended high -frequency audiograms as an outcome measure for ototoxicity monitoring. 6.3. Methods 6.3.1. Ethics Ethical approval was obtained by the University of Nottingham School of Medicine Re- search Committee on 11th June 2020 (Ref FMHS 17 -0520). The consent process in- volved reading a page of information about the survey, then ticking individual boxes confirming that participants hav e read and understood the information and agree to consent and participate in the survey. Email addresses and a telephone number were 234 included in the information in the event an individual may have any queries or concerns prior to consent . 6.3.2. Survey Developm ent This study employed a cross -sectional and anonymous online survey design. The target populations were separated into two groups, Group 1 was aimed towards hearing pro- fessionals and Group 2 was aimed towards adults LWBC. The questions used in the sur- veys were purposefully developed for this study. The questions were not formally vali- dated due to time constraints but were based on other studies carried out by the re- search team assessing related research questions. The suitability, readability and ade- quacy of the questions were evaluated by distributing a pilot survey to approximately 6 clinicians, and a PPI representative cohort for comments and feedback. Potential ques- tions were developed and then refined according to the feedback. Following the refine- men t of these questions, the online surveys were created using the JISC platform. The surveys included both multiple choice and free -text questions, in addition to the stand- ardised consent form. Survey 1: Clinical Perspectives The first survey was aimed at healthcare professionals specialising in hearing. The sur- vey comprised the consent process, and four main sections consisting of 28 questions. The first section aimed to collate demographic information, the second asked about ca- reer -specific information such as specialisms and healthcare settings. Following this, in- formation about general ototoxicity monitoring was collected. This section included as- sessing how the respondents current practise monitors chemotherapy -induced otot oxi- city, follow -up processes and an estimated prevalence from their personal experience. 235 Finally, questions on extended high -frequency and self -test audiometry were asked. This section asked about the respondents' experience with both tests, and their view s on the reliability and feasibility in clinical settings. Survey 2: LWBC Perspectives The second survey was aimed at adults LWBC to explore the acceptability of ototoxicity monitoring and the use of self -tests during chemotherapy. For this survey, I included a content warning of cancer, chemotherapy and hearing loss as to inform people who would have potential triggers to the subject prior to any interaction with the survey. Following the consent process there were 4 sections to this survey. The surv ey con- sisted of 31 questions, involving a mixture of free text and multiple choice. Similarly, this survey firstly asked about demographic information, such as gender, employment status and education level. The second section focussed on cancer, and type o f chemo- therapy (if known). Questions about hearing, changes to hearing following chemother- apy and any experience of baseline hearing tests were asked in section 3. Following this, the acceptability of the self -test devices, including appropriate timings an d hypothetical scenarios were investigated. Finally, links to useful and supportive information about ototoxicity, late effects and hearing loss were displayed in the event a participant needed any extra support. This included links to MacMillan, NHS, Acti on on Hearing loss and the British Tinnitus Association services. 6.3.3. Recruitment The first page explained to the potential participant the aims of the survey, including that answering the survey is entirely voluntary and that their treatment and care will not be affected by their decision. The surveys were distributed through links on social 236 media, including Facebook groups, LinkedIn, Twitter etc. Furthermore, all invited par- ticipants were asked to share the study link with people they know that could poten- tially be interested. The surveys were only in the English language, therefore would be restricted to people who understand and speak English. 6.3.4. Eligibility Criteria There were two surveys in this study to investigate into each of the following popula- tions: Hearing Professionals: this includes audiologists, clinical scientists (in hearing), ENT specialists, and audio -vestibular physicians. Adults LWBC who have been treated with chemotherapy Inclusion criteria involved the above and being an adult (18 years or older). The sample size was estimated using a target of 37 participants for Survey 1: Clinical Perspectives (population of 40 clinicians with 95% CI and a 5% margin of error) and 80 participants in Survey 2: LWBC Perspectives (population of 100 with a 95% CI and 5% margin of er- ror). 6.3.5. Analyses Statistical analyses were performed on SPSS v26. Normal distribution was calculated by Kolmogorov -Smirnov test of normality. Statistical tests performed involved frequency testing and correlation analysis. For ordinal questions, percentages were added to mini- mise subjectivity in answers. For example, rarely was defined as being 1 -24%, some- times 25 -49%, often 50 -74% and frequently 74 -99%. For the free text questions, NVivo v12 was used to thematically analyse the answer s established by the Braun and Clarke 237 Methods in widespread use (V. Braun, Clarke 2006) . This was carried out by two inde- pendent researchers , myself and a nother PhD student (MS) . 6.4. Results Survey 1: Clinical Perspectives 6.4.1.1. Demographic Summ ary In total, 87 hearing professionals completed this survey in full. Most participants were recruited through colleagues or employers (51.7 %), though 35.6 % found the survey from Facebook. The age ranged between 22 -69 years with a mean of 39.29 (SD: 10.9 3), shown in Table 24. Most participants were female (79.3 % , n = 69) and married or in a domestic partnership (63.2 % , n = 55) . Furthermore, 27 participants (31 %) were sin- gle, and 3 individuals were separated or divorced. How old are you? Mean 39.29 Median 40.00 Mode 41 Std. Deviation 10.932 Range 22-69 ( 47) Table 24 displays the mea n, median, mode and standard deviation of the age range from the participants. Participants were also asked about ethnicity , nationality and country of residence . Eth- nicity was a free -text question instead of a drop -down list, as the survey was interna- tional there were many ethnicities that would be excluded by using the UK governmen t guidelines for asking about ethnicity, or the Office for National Statistics as these are both UK based (Statistics n.d.; G OV.UK n.d.) . Almost all participants identified as White (67 %) or Caucasian (10.6 %). There were many nationalities represented in the survey. 238 Most of the respondents were from English -speaking countries British (43 %), English (9.3 %), Irish (8.1 %), Welsh (1.2 %), Australian (4.7 %), Canadian (1.2 %) and Ameri- can (9.3 %). However, participants were also Egyptian, Cypriot, Belgian and others . Most participants also resided in the UK (59.8 %), the USA (10.3 %) and other English - speaking countries such as Australia (5.7 %), Canada (2.3 %), Ireland (9.2 %) and South Africa (2.3 %) The majority of respondents were audiologists (77 %); however, ENT specialists, audio - vestibular physicians, clinical scientists and hearing therapists completed the survey, seen in Table 25. Profession Frequency Percentage (%) Cumulative Percentage (%) Audio -vestibular Physician 1 1.1 1.1 Audiologist 67 77 78.2 Clinical Scientist (Audiology) 10 11.5 89.7 ENT Specialist 7 8 97.7 Other, please specify* 2 2.3 100 Total 87 100 Table 25 displays the frequencies, percentage and cumulative percentage of the respondents' profession. *Other included 1 ENT resident and 1 hearing therapist. Most hearing professionals were employed either full time (66.7 %) or part time (21.8 %). However, due to the COVID -19 pandemic, some hearing professionals were also fur- loughed or unable to work (4.6 %). The education levels of the survey respondents var- ied, however 5 1 (58.6 %) had a postgraduate degree, and a third of hearing profession- als rec eived an undergraduate degree (33. 3%, n = 29 ). 239 6.4.1.2. Ototoxicity The second part of the survey asked questions about ototoxicity monitoring services. When asked if their place of work offers a hearing screening service, either by PTA or otoacoustic emissions (O AEs) to adults exposed to ototoxic medication as part of their cancer regime, only 8 (9.2 %) participants stated that their workplace had a dedicated team for this in oncology. Otherwise, adults were seen within the general audiology ser- vice (71. 3%, n = 62) or not offered any screening at all (21.8 %, n = 19) , seen in Table 26. However, some participants responded with conflicting answers, by stating the ir workplace did not offer any ototoxicity monitoring service and that they had a dedi- cated team or were seen as part of normal care. Those that answer ed 'Other ' were en- couraged to write a free text answer, which included: \"We do [offer an ototoxicity by the oncologist\" and \"there is a service but not sure of the process and pathway .\" Do you currently offer a hearing screening service (Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA) and/or Otoa- coustic Emissions (OAEs)) to adults exposed to ototox ic medication as part of their cancer treat- ment regime? Fre- quency Per- cent No, this service is not currently offered 17 19.5 Other* 2 2.3 Yes, adults are seen within our general Audiology service 59 67.8 Yes, adults are seen within our general Audiology service AND No, this service is not currently offered 1 1.1 Yes, we have a dedicated team that carry out PTA and/or OAE in oncology 5 5.7 Yes, we have a dedicated team that carry out PTA and/or OAE in oncology AND No, this service is not curren tly offered 1 1.1 240 Yes, we have a dedicated team that carry out PTA and/or OAE in oncology AND Yes, adults are seen within our general Audiology service 2 2.3 Table 26 represents the different services the participants' place of work offer for patients with ototoxicity. The question asked was: Do you currently offer a hear- ing screening service (Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA) and/or Otoacoustic Emis- sions (OAEs)) to adults ex posed to ototoxic medication as part of their cancer treatment regime? *Participants that answered Other wrote the following: \"We do [offer an ototoxicity screening service] if requested by the oncologist\" and \"there is a service but not sure of the proces s and pathway .\" Communication between oncology and audiology occurred sometimes by a dedicated audiologist (12.6 %, n = 11 ) or administrator (13.8 %, n = 12), though for many of the respondents, there was no dedicated person that oncology could contact (63 .2 %, n = 55). Those that answered 'Other ' were encouraged to write a free text answer which re- sulted in the following results: \"The oncology team in our hospital contact our audiology department directly and send in an electronic referral\" and \"Internal e lectronic referral system allowing oncologists to request audiology which is then processed by a dedi- cated audiology administration team .\" Furthermore, when asked about which professional was responsible for discussions surrounding ototoxic medication wit h patients, most stated that it was the consultant (50.6 %, n = 44 ) or other member of the oncology team (23 %, n = 20) overseeing the patient's care. Following this, 31 ( 35.6 %) of the hearing professionals answered that they were unsure of who was respon sible for this and 18 ( 20.7 %) stated that it was the audiologist that discussed these issues , shown in Figure 27. 241 Figure 27 displays the participant's opinions on who they think is responsible for discussing the risks of ototoxic medication with patients. Though the majority re- sponded it is the consultant overseeing their care (n = 44), many were unsure (n = 31). When deciding on assessments, including which hearing assessment and follow -up re- gimes, 15 ( 17.2 %) stated that this is decided by an audiologist. A total of 17 (19.5 %) were unsure and 45 ( 51.7 %) stated that this is decided by the consultant in charge of patient care. Respondents that selected 'Other ' were encouraged to answer in a free text box. The answers were as follows: \"The initial assessment is decided by the co nsultant in charge, the subsequent assessment is based on patient symptoms, patient asks for as- sessment ,\" \"The ENT and Oncology team request assessments, audiology would initiate rehabilitation with patients where this is indicated .\" Furthermore, the results of any hearing assessment were typically found to be commu- nicated between departments via an audiogram in the medical record (n = 32) alone, an audiogram in the medical record and an interpretation (n = 38) or both the audiogram and the interpretation alongside another free -text answers (n = 5). Free texts answers 242 included by email or letter between departments. Though, 5 were unsure and 5 relied on solely the interpretation . Figure 28 displays the participa nts experiences on how the results of a hearing test are communicated between departments. Information about patient the prevalence of baseline hearing assessment was varied. When asked about how often patients receive a pre -treatment hearing assessment, 9 re- sponded never, 31 with sometimes, almost 25% (n = 23) with often and only 9 (10.3 %) responded with always . Though 10% (n = 14) were unsure and 1 responded with \"other\" which involved a free text saying they had not experienced cross -referencing be- tween departments . This was arranged mainly by the oncology team (85.7 %, n = 54) and regular follow -ups during treatment were carried out following a pathway designed either by the oncology team (23 %, n = 23) , designed by the audiology team (11.5 %, n = 10 ) or not following 243 any particular pathway or guideline (26.4 %, n = 23). When asked how these assess- ments were arranged , 54 participants responded that it was by the oncology team com- pared to 15 by the audiology team. Only 2 participants selected through a database, 2 did not know and 1 responded other with the free text option saying, \"through the ENT department\" . Partici pants were then asked a follow -up question about seeing patients for regular reviews after being exposed to ototoxic medication and wh ich pathway they followed, seen in Figure 29. Figure 29 displays the participant's experienced on how often they saw a patient exposed to ototoxic medication for regular follow -ups. Though the majority re- sponded yes (n = 53) by following a pathway designed by the oncology team (n = 20), by the audiology team (n = 10) or not following any particular pathway (n = 23), 16 responded saying they were unsure and 18 responded that they did not. Though, 18 ( 20.7 %) hearing professionals admitted that they did not see oncology pa- tients exposed to ototoxic medication for regular reviews during t reatment, and 16 (18.4% ) were unsure. A similar question was asked about follow -up assessments after 244 treatment had ended and 28 ( 32.2 %) responded that were followed up post -treatment, but not following any particular pathway or guideline. After treatment, 19 ( 21.8 %) par- ticipants said there was no follow -up offered, and 13 ( 14.9 %) stated they were unsure. Furthermore, participants were asked about, in their professional experience, how often intervention for hearing loss was needed for those undergoing ototoxic medication. Most were unsure (34.5 %, n = 30 ), 84 participants stated that at least every 1 in 4 pa- tients needed intervention for hearing loss , with the most common answer (27.6 %, n = 24) being between 25 - 49 % of the time. Participants were also asked about their expe- rience of chemotherapy -induced tinnitus and balance and how often they saw this in their profession. Tinnitus was reported similarly to hearing loss, wit h 21 participants stating they were unsure, but 22 (25.3 5) said sometimes (25 - 49 %) and 21 (24.1 %) said often (50 - 74 %). A question asking about ototoxicity protocols and pathways found 25 ( 28.7 %) of par- ticipants stating they had dedicated protocols and pathways for patients undergoing ototo xic medication. Participants were encouraged to explain this further in a free -text question. Many responded describing how their workplace had protocols for paediatric ototoxicity but not adult ototoxicity, or in fact had local standard operating procedur e for patients but did not follow any validated system. Most responses stated that there are no testing protocols available, or that specific tests are typically requested by oncol- ogy. The themes emerged from this question are seen in Figure 30.245 Figure 30 displays the themes and examples of answers that emerged from the question \"Do you have testing protocols and pathways dedicated to this group of adults? Please Explain .\" Themes included: Dedicated protocol, general service, oncologist referral, unsure an d no protocols. Do you have testing protocols and pathways dedicated to this group of adults?

Participants were asked if they were aware of any ototoxicity monitoring practice and to give examples. The following themes emerged from this questio n, shown in Figure 31. 247 Figure 31 displays the themes and examples of answers from the free -text ques- tion \"Are you aware of any good practice guidance regarding the monitoring of hearing during treatment that is potentially ototoxic?\". Themes included: AAA guidelines, ASHA guidelines, BSA guidelines, High -frequency monitoring, NCRAR guidelines, NICE guidelines, not aware, local gui dance, patient reticence protocol in development and research guidelines. Are you aware of any good practise guidance regarding the monitoring of hearing during treatment that is potentially ototoxic? AAA Guidelines\"Yes from the AAA Guidelines\" \" American Academy of Audiology Position Statement and Clinical Practice Guidelines\" ASHA Guidelines \"Yes, the ASHA octae over 18 months\" NCRAR\"U.S. Veterans Affairs guidance from NCRAR\" NICE Guidelines\"NICE management of hearing loss\" Not Aware\"No sorry, it would be welcomed but shared across oncology and audiology\" Local Guidance\"We have our own protocol\" \"We have an ENT guide locally\" Patient Retinence\"This isn't needed, patients rarely want audiometry monitoring\" Protocol in Development\"We are currently in the process of setting one up\" Research Guidelines\"I'm aware of some good papers recommending procedures\"248 Participants were also asked about EHF PTA and if this forms part of ototoxicity moni- toring . In total, 51 participants stated they did not carry out any EHF PTA , but those that repl ied yes (n = 21) or sometimes (n = 12) carried out frequencies at 8 kHz (n = 24) , 10 kHz (n = 29), 12.5 kHz (n = 29) , 14 kHz (n = 22) and 16 kHz (n = 22) . When asked about why EHF is not carried out, the most common response was the lack of testing resour ces, with 34 (54%) stating they did not have equipment available within the department. Other answer ed that they were concerned about calibration (n = 10), would not know what frequencies needed to be tested (n = 5), or would not impact the care offered (n = 17). A total of 15 participants responded other that allowed free text. This included EHF not being standard protocol, lack of training, lack of time and difficulty in reporting and how a protocol had not yet been developed but is underway. Finally , participants were asked about self -test devices and their experiences and opin- ions on how they could take part in ototoxicity monitoring. Most (44.8 %, n = 39) had no prior experience to working with self -test devices. Those that did were mainly for re- search purposes (40 %, n = 10) . A follow -up question was asked to identify which settings these had been used. The ma- jority that had experience had it in a research setting (n = 10) , followed by in a clinical setting (n = 6), though 3 were unsure. As mentioned previously, self -test devices are assessments that does not require an au- diologist present. The aim of a self -test device is to screen for any issues individually, without the need for soundproof rooms or appointments. Hearing pr ofessionals were 249 asked about their opinions on oncology patients using self -tests to monitor their hear- ing during ototoxic treatment. Most participants would be happy to use pre -treatment (36.8 %, n = 32) or during treatment ( 51.7 %, n = 45). Though, 17 ( 19.5 %) responded that they would not be happy with patients using a self -test device. Furthermore, participants were asked about their opinion on reliability and accuracy where non -audiologists could use self -tests. A total of 34 participants stated they would be happy to use the results as a baseline test, however the remaining participants ex- pressed their concern and lack of confidence in using the results. This question was multi -choice, with the most common answer being that they would be happy both pre - treatment and during treatment (n = 26) , during treatment only (n = 17). Though, 15 participants responded they would not be happy using a self -test device at any point during cancer treatment. Finally, a free text question was then asked to explore these opinions on why people were hesitant to use results from self -test devices. The major themes that emerged from this question were the concerns over validation of the device and lack of reliability, un- suitable environment, no audiologist and patient interpretation. Validation of the device and unsuitable environments raised similar concerns, where the self -test assessment itself would not be appropriate. this could be due to different headphones being used between patients, the device not being optimised or going through clinical trials, to not being in a soundproof room and this impacting the results. Where there is no audiolo- gist present, the patient could potentially not carry out the test properly or skew the data. Finally, patients could interpret the results of the test incorrectly , causing concern , displayed in Figure 32. 250 Figure 32 displays the themes identified from the survey question: If you would be hesitant or not trust the reliability and ac- curacy of self -test devices, why do you think that is? The themes developed include validated devices, unsuitable environment, no audiologist and patient interpretation. If you would be hesitant or not trust the reliability and accuracy of self -test devices, why do you think that is?Validated Devices\"I would have to look into the accuracy and literature of these devices before advising patients to use. This would also have to be subjected to appropriate pilot clinical trials.\" Unsuitable Environment\"I am hesitant about tests carried out without the use of a sound -proof booth.\" \" Ambient noise would impact the result.\" No Audiologist\"Most patients can't follow verbal directions; I would distrust any \"test\" that was not conducted by an audiologist, in person.\" \"Professionals are meant for testing, not machines.\" Patient Interpretation\"I am fearful that patients don't take it seriously and hence results would be affected.\" \" The reliability of results and how the test is performed could cause a lot of unnecessary worry.\"251 Survey 2: LWBC Perspectives 6.4.1.3. Demographic Summary In total, 80 people responded to the survey. However, 1 participant was excluded due to their responses being inadequate , for example \"alien of 1 20 years of age\" . Most partici- pants found the survey on Twitter (44.3 %, n = 35) but some found it on other social media or on tinnitus websites and cancer forums. Participants' age ranged from 25 to 75, with a mean of 5 1.87 (SD 10. 15), seen in Table 27. The majority we re female (77.2 %, n = 61) and married or in a domestic partnership (73.4 %, n = 58) , seen in Figure 33. How old are you? Mean 51.87 Median 53 Mode 57 Std. Deviation 10.1 5 Range 25 - 75 (50) Table 27 displays the age demographics of the participants in the LWBC online survey. 252 Figure 33 displays the marital status of the participants included in the online survey. The majority (n = 58) were married or in a domestic partnership , fol- lowed by single (n = 12) and divorced (n = 5). Two were separated and 2 were widowed. Ethnicity, nationality, and country of residence were also asked in the survey. Over half of the participants identified as White, with most being White British . Furthermore, most participants (79.7 %, n = 63) stated that their nationality was British and that they resided in the UK (86.8 %, n = 66) , Though, participants also resided in the USA (n = 4), Australia (n = 2), Iceland, Italy, New Zealand and Singapore (n = 1). When asked about employment status, almost half of respondents were employed full time (38 %, n = 30), though many were also employed part time (19 %, n = 15) or re- tired (15.2 %, n = 12). Those that answered the other option stated they were on a phased return to work, and one individual was shielding due to COVID -19, shown in Fig- ure 34. 253 Figure 34 displays the main employment status of the participants. Those that se- lected other had a free -text box they could write in. Answers to this were \"phased return to work\" and \"shielding due to COVID -19\". 6.4.1.4. Cancer and Chemotherapy The second stage of the survey asked about cancer and cancer treatment. When asked about diagnosis, 67 (84.8 %) participants had had cancer in the past as an adult, and 12 (15.2 %) participants had cancer at the time of completing the survey. When asked about what type of cancer participants were diagnosed with, the answers varied majorly. This question allowed for free text to be used. This way participants could explain st age, grade, multiple cancers or sites amongst other individual complica- tions. From those that included stage in their answer, 8 had stage I, 19 had stage II, 13 had stage III and 6 had stage IV cancer. Types of cancers varied but breast cancer, testic- ular cancer and lymphoma were common answers between participants. However, some participants answered carcinoma or sarcoma and did not specify the area the can- cer was. 254 When asked about chemotherapy, 28 (35.4 %) participants had received chemotherapy in the pa st 5 years, 15 participants (19 %) had received chemotherapy within the past year and 6 (7.6 %) were currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment , shown in Fig- ure 35. Figure 35 displays the frequency of people who received chemotherapy currently, in the past year, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years and 50 years. When asked about cycles of chemotherapy, 4 (5.1 5) participants had received either 1, 2, 3, or 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Ei ght (10.1 %) participants had received 4 cycles of chemotherapy. A total of 32 (40.5 %) had received 6 cycles of chemotherapy and 5 ( 6.3 5) has received 7 cycles. A total of 18 (22.8 5) participants had received more than 7 cy- cles of chemotherapy. Some pa rticipants (17.7 %, n = 14) could not remember the type of chemotherapy they received, 37 (46.8 %) stated they did not receive any platinum based chemotherapy . However, when asking about specific regimes , these same individuals stated they have 255 received re gimes that included platinum, for example dexamethasone, cyclophospha- agent (BEP) . Thus, these results should be interpreted with caution. A total of 10 (12.7 %) in- dividuals state d they received cisplatin, and another 10 carboplatin. Only 5 (6.3 %) par- ticipants stated they received oxaliplatin. However as stated above, without medical records and the reliance on self -reporting measures, these results are not considered accurate. 6.4.1.5. Ototoxicity The following stage of the survey asked about ototoxicity. Noo objective hearing assess- ments were carried out, participants were asked to self -report their perceived hearing health before, during and after chemotherapy treatment. The majority (69 %, n = 55) reported no hearing loss or tinnitus, 3 participants reported hearing loss, 14 (17.7 %) participants reported tinnitus and 5 participants reported having both. When asked about changes in hearing health during chemotherapy, 9 (11.4 %) participants reported developing tinnitus, 12 developed hearing changes and 9 re- ported developing both hearing loss and tinnitus. Furthermore, a follow -up question was asked about how long their hearing loss lasted. One individual stated it had returned to normal but after 6 or more months, and 2 par- ticipants stated it returned to normal 6 months or less following their onset of symp- toms. However, 17 (21.5 %) participants stated their hearing did not return. When asked the same follow -up about tinnitus, 5 participants said their tinnitus remains the same as the onset, 10 participants (12.7 %) stated they have tinnitus still but it has 256 changed in pitch or volume and only 2 participants stated they stopped experiencing tinnitus 6 months or less following the onset. When asked about hearing health after chemotherapy ended, more than half (53.2 %, n = 42) reported no change in hearing health after chemotherapy. However, 18 (22.8 %) reporte d an onset of ototoxicity 6+ months after chemotherapy and 14 reported onsets of ototoxicity up to 6 months following treatment. From these, 14 (17.7 %) participants reported tinnitus, and 14 reported both hearing loss and tinnitus. Only 4 participants reported experiencing hearing loss as a late effect of chemotherapy. Participants were then asked about support with their hearing loss and/or tinnitus and who they sought help from. In total, 23 (47.9 %) participants did not seek help, but of those that did, 8 (16.7 %) told their oncology team and 7 (14.6%) told their GP o r audi- ologist. Participants were then asked if they saw a professional about their change in hearing, with 32 (58.2 %) stating they were not offered any support. A question on ototoxicity awareness was then asked to participants. Were you aware at the tim e of starting treatment that hearing loss and tinnitus can be a side effect of some chemotherapies (cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin?). A total of 59 (74.7 %) participants stated they were not aware and 79 (100 %) participants were not offered a baselin e hearing test. Finally, participants were asked about self -help devices. The majority (84.8 %, n = 67) stated they would be willing to test their own hearing during chemotherapy treatment. Those that answered no were prompted to explain why. Only 5 parti cipants answered no, and their rationale was due to cyber security or not owning a smart phone, and how 257 chemotherapy can make you fatigued, thus hearing tests would be too overwhelming for them to undergo. 6.5. Discussion Two online surveys were developed to explore the acceptability of ototoxicity monitor- ing in both patients and healthcare professionals. Demographically in both surveys, most participants were female in a marriage or domestic partnership who had received an undergraduate degree or equivalent. Furthermore, the majority of participants iden- tified as White and resided in the UK. This isn't representative of the international popu- lation, which suggests a high selection bias and response bias. This could be due t o the way the surveys were distributed, mainly on social media/online forums. Depending on who further distributed the surveys it could be that it only reached a select population, for example those with higher education. One example is that the research t eam shared the surveys on their Twitter accounts, where the majority of their follower were also re- searchers. If these followers shared the survey and their followers were also research- ers, there is a risk of the survey not reaching a heterogenous populati on. Furthermore, the majority of participants were White -British in both surveys. This suggests the phrasing of the surveys were targeted mainly for British people and their experiences in healthcare (for example the NHS), or it may be that there are perso nal and systematic barriers for non -White British people to access research and additional care. For exam- ple, there has been evidence that there is socioeconomic bias when carrying out web - based questionnaires, thus steps such as focus groups and PPI repre sentatives should be used, where possible, to ensure inclusiveness (Jang, Vorderstrasse 2019) . 258 Awareness surrounding ototoxicity differed greatly between adults LWBC and healthcare professionals. Most adults LWBC (74.7 %) were not aware that chemother- apy has an impact on hearing health, whereas the hearing professionals, though aware of ototoxicity, had varied opinions on who was r esponsible for discussing this with their patient s. Furthermore, most hearing professionals admitted to not knowing or following a specific or national protocol to monitor ototoxicity. For this reason, it can be assumed that confusion amongst healthcare professionals on whose responsibility it is to discuss ototoxicity with the patient, in addition to there being no national monitoring protocol is somewhat the reason why awareness is lacking. A clear pathway between oncology, audiology and primary care delineating whose responsibility it is to discuss ototoxicity and guidance on how to monitor a patient's hearing before, during and after treatment could help detect early signs of ototoxic ity and ensure everyone undergoing chemother- apy received the same level of care. This may not be feasible for each department, for example Nottingham has geographical limitations where the audiology and oncology departments are at opposite ends of the city . Thus, having a full baseline PTA during other baseline checks such as blood tests would not be ideal . However, having a self -test device within the oncology department , or an app or web -based self -device for the pa- tient to carry out at home, can then be communicated to a dedicated audiologist or GP would ensure hearing health is monitoring. Furthermore, in the event the self -test iden- tifies anything of concern, such as sudden hearing loss, the patient could then be sent to audiology directly from the onco logist GP for support. Furthermore, when asking about self -test devices most adults (84.8 %) LWBC answered that they would be willing to test their own hearing during treatment. Only 5 partici- pants stated they would not , due to technical concerns such as cyber security and lack of 259 smartphones, or due to feeling fatigue d because of chemotherapy. On the other hand, hearing professionals expressed their concerns about the reliability, validity and lack of trained audiologists to interpret results. For a service to be successful, both the patients and healthcare professionals would have to deem it acce ptable. In this event, there is concern from the hearing professionals about the reliability and accuracy of this device. Thus, it can be interpreted that with current technology , a monitoring service using self - test devices either in the oncology departme nt or at the patient's home would not be successful. It could be suggested that self -test devices are used as a quick screening tool for individuals undergoing chemotherapy, but the free -text answers suggests than audi- ologists and other hearing professiona ls would prefer to carry out the gold standard PTA in a soundproof room, and thus the self -test results would not be needed. The contrasting opinions from adults LWBC and hearing professionals suggest that cur- rently for both groups to accept a service, a full PTA carried out to gold standards (for examples the BSA protocol) would be needed. As discussed previously, this would not always be possible. Firstly, a national protocol for both oncology and audiology, on how to communicate the risks of ototoxic ch emotherapy to the patient must be developed to ensure no patient is missed. Secondly, a screening system , whether that be using self - device, an audiologist using a portable PTA and travelling to the oncology department, or the patient booking their own PTA within the audiology department must be devel- oped and agreed upon between patient, oncology and audiology. Finally, national guide- lines which could be localised for each site, need to be developed to ensure adults LWBC are receiving the same quality of ca re. This could be screening following each cycle, be- fore and after chemotherapy or using self -test devices throughout but at the patient's own timings. Finally, the results must be shared between audiology, oncology and/or 260 primary care so that everyone can communicate effectively and are not interpreted dif- ferently by each clinician. This way, departments can discuss how best to support some- one experiencing ototoxicity, whether it be hearing loss or tinnitus. 6.6. Strength and Limitations These surveys identif ied opinions from two key groups involved with ototoxicity. For a service to be successfully implemented in care, both patients and professionals would have to agree a service is acceptable and feasible. The survey targeting hearing profes- sionals identifie s how there is apprehension about self -test screening tools and which guidelines to following when dealing with a patient experiencing chemotherapy -in- duced ototoxicity. Furthermore, the survey identified various opinions on whose re- sponsibility of care it was to monitor ototoxicity. Online surveys are an accessible, quick and easy way to access informatio n from participants no matter what the eligibility cri- teria may be, given they have access to the internet. It allows for participants to be anonymous and thus sharing more thoughts and opinions that otherwise may be im- pacted by a researcher being present. The surveys collected information key to progress the field of ototoxicity monitoring by identifying the key barriers present for successful implementatio n. There were various limitations to this online study. Firstly, the surveys were not com- pleted by many individuals. For the sample of respondents to be representative of the population, more adults would have needed to complete the survey. The survey was only accessible to individuals who spoke and understood the English language and who had internet access. This means the survey ha d potential coverage bias. However, it was reported that in 2019, 93 % of British households had access to the internet, this still 261 leaves 7 % of the population excluded from participating in this study (Statistics 2020) . Furthermore, as the survey was shared on social media, those that participated in the survey were more likely to have so cial media accounts or know someone with a social media account. There was possibility for sampling bias because of this . It is worth noting that both surveys had a high response bias. This includes individuals that respond ed in a way they think the resear cher wants or may be more inclined to an- swer a certain way due to their personal experience with ototoxicity. For example, it can be assumed those who have experienced ototoxicity may be more inclined to answer a survey about ototoxicity compared to those who have not. The surveys were completed internationally, thus experiences on healthcare knowledge were not representative of the British population. It is important to gain a fu rther un- derstanding on the awareness of ototoxicity internationally, it may n ot always be feasi- ble to formally assess the acceptance of a service for one population or area. 6.7. Conclusion The two online surveys identified key gaps in information and awareness from both adults L WBC and healthcare professionals in hearing. The results showed that adults LWBC were not aware of ototoxicity, irrespective of having experienced it. Furthermore, hearing professionals, such as ENTs and audiologists, were not aware of what protocol to foll ow should a patient present with ototoxicity . Adults LWBC were enthusiastic about self -test devices to monitor their hearing, either as part of their baseline test in oncology clinic or at home, though hearing professionals showed disagreement . Some were e nthusiastic about the use of self -test devices, whilst others would not trust the ac- curacy or reliability of results. A standardise d ototoxicity protocol is needed to ensure 262 that awareness surrounding the topic is increased, and patients receive care regar dless of location or clinical team.263 Discussion 7.1. General Discussion This thesis aimed to identify how chemotherapy -induced ototoxicity impacts QoL in adults LWBC. The published literature surrounding this topic showed that although QoL was reduced in adu lts that had been treated with platinum based chemotherapy , no di- rect ass ociation or in -depth analysis has been performed (Langer et al. 2013) . Further- more, many studies identified in the systematic review carried out in Chapter 2. Chapter 1. were poorly designed, did not specify the type of chemother apy or type of hearing as- sessment made, or did not formally assess QoL using validated methods. The systematic review found little studies relevant to the research quest ion and identified large gaps in the literature. Research on long -term effects from che motherapy is a developing field and thus few studies have been carried out and published. An alternative approach was taken to identify the severity and impact of ototoxicity on those experiencing i t. Thus, forum reviews were then analysed to answer the research questions left unanswered by the systematic review. Following this, two clinical studies were developed . One mixed -methods study aimed to explore in -depth experiences from adults LWBC who experienced ototoxicity and to identify the sev erity, impact on QoL and what support, if any, they received. Another clinical study was developed to identify the prevalence of ototoxicity by adopting a cross -sectional method . Patients at chemo- therapy follow -up clinics had their hearing tested, alongsid e completing a QoL question- naire. These two studies aimed to identify how many people experienced ototoxicity and what this experience was. Finally, an online survey was developed to identify what support is needed and how both adults LWBC and clinicians w orking in hearing health felt about ototoxicity monitoring. These exploratory studies aimed to: 264 Identify the prevalence of long -term hearing loss and tinnitus in adults LWBC treated with platinum ba sed chemotherapy . Identify the level of awareness adults LWBC have of ototoxicity prior to receiving platinum based chemotherapy . Identify the level of awareness clinicians have of ototoxicity prior to offering platinum based chemotherapy . Compare the QoL of those with and without ototoxicity i n those receiving plati- num based chemotherapy . Compare the severity of hearing loss and tinnitus in those receiving platinum based chemotherapy to the general population Identify the key aspects of QoL that are impacted by ototoxicity. Identify the suppor t received by those that experienced chemotherapy -induced ototoxicity. 7.2. Lack of Awareness One of the main findings from the forum review analys is was the lack of awareness from those experiencing ototoxicity. There were many instances of adults LWBC stati ng they were confused about the side effects, experiencing hearing loss and tinnitus and think- ing it would be temporary or in some instances mistaking this for cancer metastasis to the brain . Others shared frustration, anger and sadness about how their hearing loss was permanent and they wish they had known this sooner . This emphasis es the fact that often, long -term side effects remain unknown , leaving patients asking amongst themselves and potentially seeking misinformation online or not receiving the appro- priate care. One study found that almost 50% of adults LWBC had an inaccurate under-265 standing of their illness , concluding that there is not only a barrier between the commu- nication of treatm ent-related information and how it is understood, but if the infor- mation is accepted by the patient (Hui et al. 2021) . Results from the mixed -methods study showed that only one participant was offered a baseline hearing test. However, the participant declined as they believed nothing could be done about it. During the interviews in the mixed -methods study, the participants shared that although hearing loss and tinnitus was not always bothersome, it is the fear of not knowing what is wrong that impacts their QoL . Participants also expressed it was the accumulation of side effects that impacted QoL and that it was difficult to isolate one specific side effect. Furthermore, many felt ignored by their clinicians when talking about ototoxicity. By improving the awareness of ototoxicity, and emphasising that some side effects may be permanent , this can reduc e the concerns from patients think- ing it is a recurrence of their cancer. A qualitative analysis on women with breast cancer found that many women undergo treatment were unaware of the difference between long -term effects and late effects of chemotherapy. The participants were mainly con- cerned about neuropathy, fatigue and cognitive impairment (Rosenberg et al. 2021) . These long -term effects are typically non -life-threatening , though can impact an individ- uals' life significantly, and awareness is increasing on this topic. For example, MacMillan now have specific pages relating to cognitive impairment during cancer and includes current research and support offered (MacMillan n.d.) . In addition to the specific long - term effects of treatment, there is also an entire webpage dedicated to what happens af- ter cancer, including a webpage on late effects which was reviewed in 2020 (Macmillan n.d.) . Clinically, o totoxicity remains poorly understood and not much information is posted online or in leaflets, though this was the case for other side effects which now 266 have dedicated leaflets, webpages and community groups. One example of this is sexual health during and after cancer treatment (Carr 2022) . What used to be a stigma subject with little awareness now has a dedicated Macmillan webpage with 11 separate sub- pages , formal training for nurses on the subject, though this could be improved (Ahn, Kim 2020; Papadopoulou et al. 2019) . Awareness about long -term effects is therefore increasing, and information on specific side effects such as ototoxicity could potentially improve by following the patterns and information publish ed on other side effects. O n the other hand, increasing awareness of individual side effects may overwhelm people who are trying to process life -altering news (Hui et al. 2021) . This lack of awareness extends to healthcare professionals too. Those working in pri- mary care or indeed oncology may not always be aware of the severity of ototoxicity, or how this can impact their patients' QoL . The online survey in Chapter 6. found that those working in hearing health, such as audiologists and ENTs , did not unanimously agree on who is responsible for ototoxicity monitoring. Furthermore, there we re dis- crepancies on h ow they would personally monitor patients' hearing, if they would use EHF PTA and most clinicians either did not follow a protocol or had a local protocol they followed. This reinforces the concept that ototoxicity awareness would depend on which clinician they had, and their geographical location . Effective communication be- tween departments is key to ensure patient's receive optimal care. Raising awareness of non -acute symptoms and impacts of chemotherapy is possible. For example, sex drive/libido was onc e something not discussed due to stigma/ embarrass- ment and not seen as a priority, yet, like ototoxicity, can impact communication and re- lationships. MacMillan m ade a great effort in raising awareness and supporting people 267 going through this and is now on a ll leaflets. Furthermore, the HOPE course by MacMil- lan supports people through this too. Often no referral or intervention is needed, the validation and shared experience of people can improv e patient experiences through chemotherapy. Another example is hair loss and the use of wigs/makeup 7.3. Ototoxicity Monitoring Currently , there is no national protocol for ototoxicity monitoring . Different clinics fol- low different guidelines, some accredited and some not. Thus, a need for a standardised and gol d standard ototoxicity monitoring protocol is needed for both clinicians in oncol- ogy and audiology, and the patients. The online survey found that hearing professionals did not support the idea of self -test monitoring for ototoxicity. This was due to conce rns about reliability, accuracy and lack of a professional carrying out the procedure. On the other hand, people LWBC were enthusiastic about monitoring their own hearing in clinic or at home, without the need for additional appointments during chemotherap y. The results from the mixed -methods study showed that mos t participants were not fol- lowed up about their hearing clinically until the research study. For example, no base- line tests were carried out and no formal outcomes measures for tinnitus or hearing loss were collected. In the event a patient complained of tinnitus, this was noted in the medical record. If ototoxicity were troublesome to the participant , as part of the re- search study a direct referral from oncology to audiology could be made. However , typi- cally a patient could be referred to their GP practice and then get a separate referral to audiology which feeds back to oncology. This pathway has the potential to cause a \"re- ferral loop\" to the patient, where the effort to get the right support i s too lengthy and tiresome (Maru, Malky 2018b; Patel et al. 2018) . 268 A feasible and acceptable ototoxicity monitoring protocol needs to be developed and implemented for adults LWBC . A study in South Africa found using remote eTelehealth audiological assessments during COIVD -19 were 2022; Ehlert et al. 2022) . However, research on validity and reliability is needed to identify if remote monitoring and self -tests are feasible after the COVID -19 pandemic. As shown in the cross -sectional study, there are many ototoxicity protocols currently available, but these have a risk of underreporting o r overreporting symptoms and diag- nosis. Furthermore, many of these monitoring protocols may not be feasible in every oncology clinic. Lack of resources, geographical limitations amongst lack of communica- tion between departments can all limit the success of a monitoring service. Further- more, adding additional checks for an individual undergoing chemotherapy can increase the risk of feeling overwhelmed , spending more time in a hospital setting etc. A balance between audiology -led monitoring systems and indepe ndent screening must be met. For example, a baseline EHF -PTA could be carried out by an audiologist, but in an oncol- ogy setting, reducing the need for additional appointments for the patients. Further- more, self -tests could be used during chemotherapy cycle intervals to detect any change. In the event there is a detectable change an audiology consultation must be made, for example. The survey showed that hearing professionals were not fond of the concept of self -test devices, or patients testing their own he aring at home. A compro- mise must be made to ensure adults LWBC can receive the support they need. 7.4. Diagnosis of Late Effects Ototoxicity is considered a dose -limiting side effect, it is commonly noticed following numerous chemotherapy cycles or when the ch emotherapy regime has ended. It can be 269 suggested, therefore, that by the time the side effect is noticed there is limited time left to change the treatment regime n, as it may have already ended. Furthermore, due to the many side effects associated with platinum based chemotherapy , some in which are acute and life threatening, it may be that only the most severe at that time are discussed with clinicians. It is known that in the UK, the time spent between clinician and patient is limited (Suss et al. 2017) . For this reason, it is possible that the less acute and more manageable side effects are missed and go untreated. However, thi s allows for the side effect s to progress and the patient receives no support. It also may be that a patient is discharged or does not complete long -term follow up. Thus, not knowing who to seek help from when a long -term side effect progresses. A dedicate d late effects service was developed in Nottingham by Macmillan, unfortu- nately lack of funding meant the service is no longer offered. However, the service model involved a chemotherapy nurse and a radiotherapy specialist and the patient was able to book 2 -hour appointments to discuss any late effect they had 6 months following treatment. From this initial consultation, the patient could be referred onto specialist services directly or be followed up at the late effects service. A direct referral system be- tween this service and audiology was made to reduce the waiting time and appoint- ments needed. Many side effects appear in clusters or groups , for example hearing loss, tinnitus and peripheral neuropathy (Rha, Lee 2021; Lee et al. 2020) . It could be suggested rather than listing side effects in no specific order, that they are grouped in these clusters. This way it is more likely patients that experience one of the cluster s can understand more about what to expect, and if they do not experience any in that cluster, they would not 270 have to be overwhelmed by the information associated with it. Finally, the results from the qualitative aspects of this PhD show that some patients to not inform their clinicians of the severity of their side effects due to fear of their treatment being s topped. Th is could also be why some patients do not receive support or effective side effect manage- ment . It was also suggested that no treatment or management is available for tinnitus or hearing loss, thus they did not mention it to their clinician. 7.5. Limitations and Reflections This PhD aimed to progress the field of chemotherapy -induced ototoxicity and ho w this impacts QoL . However, there were many limitations to the multiple projects included in this thesis. Firstly, when developing a research project, collaboration and communica- tion with other experts in the field is key , but time must be considered in t he project . For example, speaking with oncologists, oncology nurses and people with cancer at vari- ous hospitals, clinics and charities helped design the various clinical studies included in this PhD, though months were spent networking, collaborating and l istening to ideas from those in clinical settings. For example, a key insight was that a hearing test should be portable, as patients did not want additional appointments when volunteering for a research project in addition to their chemotherapy appointmen ts. Thus , specialist port- able equipment was identified, which would allow for PTA hearing tests to be carried out in multiple locations . Following the identification, grants were written and applied for to gain access to this equipment, which then needed s afety testing (MESU). This safety testing at the time had a 17-week wait, thus the clinical projects faced delays . Though, this experience allowed for learning for future research projects. Indeed, time spent in the development phase of projects must be co nsidered and allow for delays such as medical equipment safety testing and ethics applications. Ethics applications 271 were a collaborative effort between Research & Innovation (R &I) at NUH and the Uni- versity. Typically, the PhD student would write and submit the ethics application to IRAS and await its outcome. The project could be discussed remotely or in person with the Principal Investigator (PI), or in this case both the PI and myself, to ask questions and then edits could be made until the research was approved. The time between sub- mission of an ethics application and the approval varies between projects, locations and type of research. However, ethics application policies change over ti me as new policies and protocols arise. A guideline for ethics application was written by myself and PhD colleagues in Hearing Science to facilitate future generations of students with the task of writing an ethics application. This PhD included many proje cts with different ethics ap- plications, which in retrospect delayed and reduced recruitment. Ethical applications for the two clinical studies could have been combined, allowing for instant recruitment following approval. Writing an d submitting HRA ethical applications and a grant appli- cation for equipment is a learning experience all clinical researchers need. The docu- ments involved in ethics applications help facilitate and improve research design, out- comes and improve t ransparency in research. For exampl e, prior to recruitment all clin- ical studies must be registered with their outcomes, aims and methodologies on clinical trial databases. Developing two clinical studies needing HRA ethics and two studies needing University of Nottingham School of Medicine ethics allowed for robust and transparent research. Studies involving participant recruitment can be challenging for new researchers. For example, visiting chemotherapy wards, speaking to patients and charities helps raise awareness of the research but ma y not always be successful. Research is voluntary and potential participants should never feel pressured to be involved with research. This 272 PhD project collaborated with NUH NHS Trust and SFH NHS Foundation Trust , along- side charities to aid recruitment. Th e clinical projects were NIHR CRN portfolio adopted, which was a separate application made alongside the HRA ethics and allows for addi- tional support when recruiting. For example, SFH NHS Foundation Trust recruited re- motely for the mixed -methods project which saved time and travel, yet allowed for a more representative sample of participants. It also meant audiology training was pro- vided by a CRN audiologist, who could either carry out the PTA or observe to ensure all protocols were met. For the mixed -methods study this was key. Travelling to partici- pant's houses and homes alone, though allowed, was discouraged by the lone -working policy and two individuals carrying out the research was safer. The population recruited in the clinical studies were racially homogenous. This is not representative of the UK and thus the results can not reflect patient experiences from ethnic monitories or different cultures (Wilkins et al. 2020) . More research is needed into how ototoxicity can impact people from different backgrounds, nationalities and ethnicities. Finally, no control population was recruited as part of the clinical studies. A mathemati- cal model was used as a comparison between participants due to limited resources but ideally a n age and gender matched control populat ion would be tested in a similar set- ting to reduce chance of bias. For example, the portable audiometer was not tested in soundproof rooms , thus hearing test results were not guaranteed to be accurate, but the mathematical model may be for the comparison i n a soundproof room or clinical set- ting. This limitation could be rectified with a matched control population in the future. 273 7.6. Impact of COVID -19 on this PhD Recruitment for the cross -sectional study had begun two weeks prior to the pandemic being announced. The study was first impacted by COVID -19 as oncology follow -up clin- ics had changed from face -to-face consultations to telephone consultation, thus impact- ing recruitment. Furthermore, the target population o f the study were clinically vulner- able and additional precautions were taken in clinics , for example non -urgent physical examinations were delayed. It was decided prior to the first lockdown to suspend the study, as although important, was not appropriate to continue in this situation. PTA ex- aminations require being in close proximity to the patien t and cannot be carried out re- motely. The study was sus pended at 7 participants and unfortunately did not reopen due to the risk outweighing the benefit to partic ipants. This has impacted the outcome of this doctoral project , as the study would have helped to answer key research ques- tions. A second coder is needed for qualitative analysis of any kind to reduce bias. There are conditions on who can be a second code r for qualitative analysis. They must be in the research team, have research integrity accreditation and be named in the ethics applica- tion. There is only one individual in Clinical Hearing Sciences that meets these criteria . Once lockdown was enforced in the UK, schools were closed which impacted parents , specifically mothers, work capacities. This, following multiple COVID -19 diagnoses within the UK, includ ing staff and students at the University, severely delayed research projects, analysis and deadlines. Furthermore, at this time there were no PCR testing kits available, Test and Trace was not yet developed, nor the vaccines . This, in additi on to adapting to remote working severely impacted not just this field of research, but re-274 search carried out globally. An amendment was submitted to ethics to include a qualita- tive colleague for secondary qualitative analysis. The amendment required the ap proval to have access to confidential and sensitive information about patient experiences , though was a learning experience for not only myself but the research team to prepare for unexpected absences from colleagues and collaborate with other researchers than would have capacity to help. Once the study was anticipated to be suspended, the opportunity arose to develop a re- mote study which answered different research questions and focussed not solely on adults LWBC, but healthcare professionals in hearing. An ethics application was devel- oped and submitted t o produce two online surveys to progress the research into ototox- icity. The online survey was developed alongside PPI representatives . The experience of working remotely during the first lockdown gave mys elf and two col- leagues an insight on how people may not adapt easily into the virtual world. While not a research project, we wrote some guidelines which were posted on the University of Nottingham Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity blog (Pearson et al. n.d.) to help others be more inclusive when m eeting online . This include d tips to ensure people remain in- cluded in meetings where body language and other non -verbal language can not always be relied on. The impact COVID -19 has had on research practically, logistically and mentally has meant both rese archers and participants are facing unprecedented challenges on how to carry out proj ects online. 7.7. Future Directions 275 The studies carried out in this PhD project aimed to answer key research questions about the prevalence, severity and impact of ototoxicity on QoL . A variety of research metho dologies were used to identify different aspects of long -term chemotherapy -in- duced ototoxicity. Further research is needed to develop quality, evidence -based infor- mation for both adults LWBC and healthcare professionals in this field. Policies and pro- tocols on ototoxicity monitoring could be optimised , ultimately improving patient care and late effects . The cross -sectional study was suspended due to COVID -19, a study on the prevalence of chemotherapy -induce d ototoxicity is needed. This study should collect more in -depth information, such as the severity of ototoxicity , which ototoxic symptoms the individual experiences and following which chemotherapy, including information about dose and number of cycles . The study should be representative of all individuals receiving plati- num based chemotherapy and include multiple cancer types, ages and genders. There are many large datasets such as the UK Biobank which , with statistical analysis, could potentially identify correlations and ris k factors between hearing loss, tinnitus and chemotherapy . For example, ma ny studies using data from the UK Biobank ha ve successfully identified genetic links and risk factors to hearing loss and tinnitus (Cherny et al. 2020) . Future research could identify potential risk factors for chemotherapy -in- duced ototoxicity and theorise possible correlations , such as genetics , occupational risks and lifestyle factors. Currently, communication on side effects is typically done at diagnosis before treatment in person between the oncologist and the patient. However, the patient is then sent home with leaflets and brochures about what to expect during their cancer journey. 276 Written booklets and leaflets may not work for everyone, and more inclusive, innova- tive approaches to medical information are needed. For example, audio -visual re- sources, interactive resources, patient -centred resources. A randomised control trial (RCT) is needed to compare various communication methods to identify the feasibility and quality of care the patient experiences. Finally, an RCT is needed to assess ototoxicity monitoring during chemotherapy . Pilot trial s on feasibility and accessibility on vari ous monitoring programmes are needed to identify the optimal programme, which then would be tested in an RCT in adults LWBC undergoing chemotherapy. 7.8. Conclusion In conclusion, chemotherapy induced hearing loss and tinnitus does not always have a major impa ct on QoL, but in those that it affects it can be life -altering. Specific areas of further research needed are: Awareness of other long -term non -life-threatening side effects has increased over the years due to charities, services and increased conversati ons between patients and healthcare professionals . For example, MacMillan have entire leaf- lets on sexual health and awareness surrounding libido after cancer is now a commonly researched and understood topic. Hearing loss and tinnitus may not impact every one who receives chemotherapy, and in many cases, it may not be severe or urgent enough for the patient to see an audiologist. Often, a patient may want to feel listened to and validated . An acceptable and feasible ototoxicity monitoring programme must be created in order to identify the prevalence, severity and timings of ototoxic effects. 277 Increased personalised awareness, regular clinical monitoring and early management of symptoms could help prevent the progression of ototoxic and subsequent reductions in QoL for those who are at higher risk of being impacted. 278 References (ASHA), A.S.

I've also had that whooshing sensation in one ear (always my left one!) after every round of chemo. It lasts 24-48 hours then seems to settle. Late onset Ototoxic effect (hearing loss and/or tinnitus) began after chemotherapy had finished Hi all, it's just over 10 months since I finished my cycles of chemo - at the time I had fairly bad tinnitus for a few weeks during and after treatment. It then went away for a long number of months. I've noticed that in the past few weeks that it is back intermittently maybe 2/3 times a day for short periods. Has anyone else had experience of this - i.e tinnitus reappearing after months and months of nothing? General tin- nitus Mentions or complaints of experiencing any type of general or non -specific tin- nitus I have had tinnitus in my left ear since having the Cisplatin and I'm wondering if it is going to stop at some point. Did the ringing in the ears that you noticed just wear off gradually, or do you still get it? Hope that you are continuing with your recovery following the RT for the lymph node. Pulsatile tin- nitus Describing tinnitus like a heartbeat, \"whooshing sound\" Chemo can cau se pneumonitis (inflammation) but would not cause fever. Because I have had a constant fever for a week, it leads them to believe it is a bacterial infection causing the inflammation. I'm on antibiotics now and hope- fully that does the job. No nail issues s o far, thankfully. I do have heartbeat thumping in my ears that can drive me nuts at times. Irreversible and perma- nent hearing loss Hearing has not improved and/or has worsened since treatment ended As far as permanent hearing loss, with the cisplatin it is (that is what I was told). When I had the hearing test, in addition to listening to sounds through your ear - they hook something up to some bones near the ear (it was a while ago, so I don't recall exactly where), and that test told the audiologist - it was permanent. I got hearing aids about 3 months after treatment was over. I wasn't told hearing loss was a possiblity. Every time I went to a doctor, I asked the doc to look at my ears - they feel clogged. Finally, one said, see the audiologist. I was crushed - I was only 45 at the time. BUT I did get the hearing aids, and they help so much 338 Irreversible and perma- nent tinnitus Tinnitus has not improved, or gone away since chem- otherapy ended I developed tinnitus after having chemo for bladder cancer (Gemcitabine and Cisplatin ) I believe Cisplatin was the culprit. I was told it could be intermittent or just go away, and if it went away, it could always come back. Unfortu- nately, 2 years on and it seems to be permanent . I recently had an ENT consultation and hearing test. Slight hearing loss, but the bottom line is that they can't do anything for tinnitus. Most of the time when I am busy, I don't notice it, but as you probably know, when you beco me aware of it, it is hard to ignore. I hope you are lucky and your goes away. Temporary Tinnitus and/or hearing loss was only temporary, or significantly improved over time Sorry to hear about the side effect. I had tinnitus from the Cisplatin (in BEP chemo), for me the symptom was a loud and high -pitched ringing for several seconds in respond to a loud noise. What form does yours take? Although mine was unpleasant it didn't become enough to stop treatment. It took just over a month after treatment for the effect to subside to a level or rate of occurrence that I rarely was aware of it , and perhaps 3 months before it went away entirely. These days (3 years on) my hearing is pr etty much normal, and I don't experience it any more. Constant tin- nitus Tinnitus is constant, not intermittent, always pre- sent Just came back out of the hospital after my first cycle of BEP this friday. I feel pretty good, except for one thing: this constant high ringing in my ears that started yesterday afternoon and seems to increase ...I understand this is a side effect of the c ysplatin. But do I have a chance of it going away any time soon? Are there any meds that can counter this? Or am I stuck with this annoying sound for the rest of my life? I'm really quite worried. Tomorrow I'm going to the hospital for some bleomycin, I wi ll ask my oncologist the same questions, but if you guys have any sug- gestions that I can give to her, they're always welcome. Intermittent tinnitus Mention or complaints of intermittent tinnitus, com- ing and going, lasting a specific time period, etc. Alf77, I've had carbo/taxol and lost hearing in both ears , have tinnitus and also hear that whooshing in both ears intermittently. Then I had cisplatin/taxol and now I definitely need hearing aids. Cannot make out the dialog on TV and hearing on telephone is difficult. Had a baseline hearing test just before chemo started and two more tests since. It is clear to see that chemo has seriously affected my hearing. But I am ALIVE!!! Chemo has SAVED MY LIFE, so I have easily accepted I'd rather be deaf than dead! T esla Loud tinnitus Complaints of how loud the tinnitus is .. and this morning got up with very LOUD tinnitus. I'm thinking it was fever -related, but I see in here that my chemotherapies don't lack for potential causes of this. I've always had a little bit of tinnitus, but this is alarming ... it's distracting and will be depressing if it keeps up. And one has to wonder, if the chemo is killing tiny nerve cells in the hearing system, what the heck it's doing to brain cells. There's a fun thought. Anyone see a reduction in tinnitus over time on chemo? Or is everyone seeing it irreversible? 339 Reduced tol- erance to sound Increased sensitivity and/or decreased toler- ance to normal sounds or sounds that were previ- ously tolerated Hearing loss Complaints of loss of hear- ing, going deaf, not being able to hear well Alf77, I've had carbo/taxol and lost hearing in both ears , have tinnitus and also h ear that whooshing in both ears intermittently. Then I had cisplatin/taxol and now I definitely need hearing aids. Cannot make out the dialog on TV and hearing on telephone is difficult. Had a baseline hearing test just before chemo started and two more te sts since. It is clear to see that chemo has seriously affected my hearing. But I am ALIVE!!! Chemo has SAVED MY LIFE, so I have easily accepted I'd rather be deaf than dead! Tesla Hearing aids Having to use hearing aids, or being told to wear hear- ing aids Hiya! Puts hand up! ive got irriversable hearing loss in both ears which has been caused by the treatment - I had a low hearing in my right ear but now it's really lowered, and I've had to have 2 hearing aids which don't help really. They just amplify noise which I'm fine with its speech i struggle with and the nhs hearing aids aren't strong enough to help with this. you need to tell your doctor asap as they can tweak your treatment to help with this - i was told this but that point it was too late. I also have constant ringing - annoying! Ototoxic ef- fects are rare Belief that ototoxic effects of chemotherapy are rare, and probably won't hap- pen, from the information they have been told by their clinician or what they have read elsewhere I reported to one of my doctors that over the last couple of weeks my hearing seems to be muffled. I also many times a day have an episode where my hearing completely goes all but the loudest high pitched ringing in this world that makes me grab my ears with both hands! It nearly sends me into a craze! My dr said that it is probably a side effect of the Cistplatin as he read that it was a rare side effect and typically irreversible .. Although he reassured me that complete deafness is pretty rare, but if it gets bad enough I might want to think about hearing aids. Excuse my language, but are you f**king kidding me? Im going to address the chemo doctor today about this. Has anyone else had a problem with their ears?? ? Treatment blamed for ototoxicity Belief that the chemother- apy has worsened hearing loss and/or tinnitus Cinque: Thank you for mentioning tinnitus. I've had that since childhood , but since starting chemo, mine has gotten much worse . Hopefully that's one of the SE that are only temporary 340 Vertigo Complaints of self -re- ported and diagnosed ver- tigo Hello,I am currently getting weekly Taxol treatments with Carboplatin added every 3rd week. I have completed 4 treatments (2 Carbo/Taxol and 2 Taxol only) and i n the weeks following Carboplatin I have had 2 \"episodes\" of ver- tigo. I call them episodes because I do n't have general dizziness, they are more acute episodes of sudden vertigo. Both times I was watching TV and suddenly felt the room spinning, and the feeling only lasts about 10 seconds. The feeling is intense, but because it is over so quickly doesn't cau se any nausea or any other side effects. I did see vertigo can be a more rare side effect of Carboplatin or Cisplatin. Has anyone else experienced anything similar? I have no previous history with vertigo, and this has only occurred since starting Carbopla tin. Thank you! Manageable symptoms Ototoxic effects are man- ageable, mild and able to ignore, without really af- fecting quality of life too much Hi Rily, Thanks for the reply - sorry your tinnitus is causing probs. Mine is certainly manageable but I just fo und it strange that it came back out of nowhere after a long time. Fingers crossed that it doesn't get worse Take care Mark Learning to live with the ototoxic ef- fects Accepting the fact that ototoxicity is permanent, and either learning to live with it, or complaining that they must learn to live with the effects, ex- pressing it as \"new me\" or \"not the same as before\" - mainly tinnitus I have been reading this posting progression and finally decided to post a response. I'm simply amazed at how much thes e chemo drugs and radiation affect us a long, long time after treatments. I'm not in the medical field (are you gdpawel?) so clueless on the specifics of drug interactions and side affects. I know my body and it's telling me 1 -1/2 yrs since my last treatme nt (had chemo and radiation - external pelvic) I'm just not the same as prior treatments. When I ask my oncologist on chemo and radiation (2 separate docs) neither one will fess up on the side affects I'm feeling.....some very minor tingling in my hands, f ast bowels, lower back pain and now pain going down my one leg, diminished hearing and vision, just to name the major ones. Really I'm not complaining, but sure nice to read up with your posts on how these drugs can truly affect us. When my body changes I like to know what's going on, don't want to have the thoughts of \"cancer is back\". Believe me, just knowing this is all I'm dealing with, I can handle, as hear- ing the word \"cancer\" again must be the worst of the worst. Amazing how we just learn to live wit h the side af- fects, as the alternative prognosis of more cancer pushes us over the edge. Reminder of cancer Complaining that the late ototoxic effects are a con- stant and permanent re- minder of cancer Rather a late post on this one but I develiped tinnitus during treatment. I'm afraid I still have it three years down the line, but only really notice it at night. For me this is a small price to pay for still being well, but it does act as a re- minder of what I have been through. Good luck with the rest of you r treatment \"Driving me mad\" Expressing distress from tinnitus I'm three years post chemo or thereabouts had 4 EC 4 Piltaxol and now have tinnitus in left ear which is getting worse. I don't recall being told chemo could damage ear and it drives me mad. Will it ever go? one good thing is sound sets it off so if I sit in silence it's okay but it's affecting my relationship now 341 General fear about hear- ing loss and tinnitus Expressing worries, fears and concerns about losing hearing and tinnitus and what this could mean Hello everyone, I'm new to the forum and diagnosed this month. While awaiting staging tests after my orchiectomy, I would really like to hear from some other people who might shed so me light on this: I'm sure everyone must find one particular aspect of the treatment particularly hard to deal with: For me, the most worrying thing I have come across has been the idea that I might suffer changes to my hearing due to the side effects of C isplatin such as tin- nitus and high FQ hearing loss. I have been playing the violin since I was five, and now as a professional violinist, I'm utterly dependent on my hearing for my work. I'm also not sure about the extent these changes might affect my sit- uation more than the average guy? I've been warned it would be wise to expect Chemo and before I meet my oncol- ogist, I'd appreciate advice from: Musicians or music lovers who have experienced hearing side effects. People who have had these side effects. Any info on the chances of this occurring, the severity, being temporary/permanent, at what doses, and to what extent. If anyone has advice on this, I'd really like to know as much as I can so that I know what's going on before I discuss further treatment. Th anks, Osca Fear that hearing loss and tinnitus will be per- manent Expressing worries and concerns over the ototoxic effects being irreversible and permanent, and hop- ing they are temporary Good afternoon everyone. I'm currently undergoing 3 cycles of BEP fo r stage 2a testicular cancer. I'm on my first cy- cle and I've just had my first bleomycin only day. Basically I'm just about to end week 2. I'm guessing you guys know generally how it works. I had noticed on day 4 during my long week (my long week is a 3 da y plan) that I had some tinnitus and also a feeling like being in a plastic box. I.e. I feel distant and everything is muffled and quiet. I know that cisplatin can cause tinnitus and hearing changes but I'm wondering if anyone gas any experience of having these effects so soon? And if they do what are the chances that this is permanent ? I think I could adapt to the tin- nitus but the quietness will be a real problem. Thanks in advance. Hearing loss and/or tinni- tus affecting day to day life Tinnitus and hearing loss having a mild to moderate impact on mood, sleep, re- lationships, social aspects of life and employment Right ear may be a tad bit more but they are close. When I talk on the phone, I actulally use my left ear . My job re- quires lots of phone calls and I use my left on the headset . That is what is so strange about it. Though the test shows hearing loss mostly in left ear, I think I have had that for years. Until they can do another test, they cannot determine that I am losing hearing. Music -re- lated worries Expressing fear over spe- cifically losing the ability to hear or play music, e.g. by musicians and music lovers I can't really answer your question but my husband also opted for Erbitux and rads without Cisplatin. He's a profes- sional musician and the risk of hearing loss was too catastrophic in terms of there being a chance of him not being able to work again . We're half way through treatment now and although the Erbitux has it's own interesting side effects, he is not getting any 'chemo' side effects. His medical team seem very confident that they're going to have a good chance of beating this with Erbitux and Rads. Whatever you decide, I'll be think ing of you. 342 Ototoxicity having a se- vere impact on quality of life Extremely deteriorated quality of life because of the impact of tinnitus and/or hearing loss. It can be described as bother- some, unbearable, severe. Quaatsi - I haven't been through near a s much as you have and I have days I'm just ready to freak out. I'm still deal- ing with these drains and it will be 2 weeks since surgery come Friday. I'm have a pain below my left shoulder blade that I am told is a common thing after mastectomy and will re quire some pt to get relief. I'm hoping it will get better after drains come out. I see the surgeon tomorrow and hope the drains come out then. Cancer takes us a piece at a time and cancer treatment does too. Since I've been taking lortabs the past 2 weeks my tinnitus has been nearly unbearable as well. I see my onc Tuesday the 17th and will see what new things I must look forward to. Only you can decide when the fight is just too much. You've been hanging in there for a very long time and fighting this bea st. My hope is that you can move past this low point and keep battling it back and holding on to each precious day and find something wonderful will find it's way in to you as you described in the past. You've been real encourage- ment to me Depression Expressing depression, misery, suicidal thoughts, giving up, and the opinion that death is better than deaf Mine hit me at about the same time, day 6 -7. I've completed two rounds now (today is day 34), and even had the Cisplantin dose reduced 20 percent for the second round due to the ringing and hearing loss. Ears are still ringing, I've had progressive hearing loss in frequencies above 2000 hz (as of Friday, latest hearing test), and I can't seem to find anything positive to report. Most say it s permanent, including my oncologist and audiologist. I may be forced to stop treatment if mine gets any worse because I'd rather be dead than deaf. Seriously. If you or anyone can find anything positive about this side effect, I'd love to hear it! I can't fin dany clinical studies or much else. Only stories from others, and most say it never goes away. Maybe I'm only hearing the bad, and not from those whose hearing returned to normal and haven't reported that My blog, linked below, chronicles my p rogress. Adjusting treatment regimes due to ototoxicity Having to reduce, change or stop treatment due to ototoxicity. Can either be told by clinicians, sharing their experiences after ad- justment or advising peo- ple to adjust treatment due to hearing loss and/or tinnitus I too had a lower left lobectomy with lingulectomy in December and started on my chemotherapy yesterday. How- ever I had discussed the choice of platinum agent with regard to the known side effects of cisplatin v. carboplatin. As I already su ffer from moderate tinnitus (exacerbated incidentally by the post surgery meds codeine and naproxen), my oncologist agreed that a regime of vinorelbine with carboplatin would have a lower risk of increased hearing problems . I would urge you to discuss this with your oncologist asap to see if it's possible to change to carboplatin for the next infusion . Good luck, Raz 343 Asking for advice Asking for general or med- ical advice from other members or encouraging anyone to share a similar experience Dear All - hope you're all in the best place for you to today and able to enjoy the sunshine at least to some degree. I'm not 100% sure why I'm on the above combo and intend to find out at my next oncologists meeting ( as when he told me at the last one it was all such a shock that the cancer had recurred after 5 months and I was going straight back on chemo having just gone back to work two months before and begun to rebuild my life/myself). I know many of you have been in the same position and it's a lot to take in but what I really want advice on is the combo above? Any one had it? Any one had it two weeks running then one week off (that's my script). I found the first day or so OK , just a bit of constipation and leth argy but then on the third day developed awful diarrhea only just beginning to subside and extreme exhaustion, dizziness and horrible spaced out feeling. I really hope this is just the first week and it calms down. I've read some scary things about cisplat in on line (hearing loss, kidney damage etc) and just wondered if anyone has had much experience . I have my next round tomorrow and really am not sure I've recovered enough from last one to have it but will talk to nurses tomorrow. Thank you, all you kind souls. Sending hugs to one and all. Mary xx \"Me too!\"/\"You're not alone\" Agreeing with and ex- pressing the same adverse effects, supportiveness and showing that they're not alone Me too .....Pulsatille tinnitus. Very annoying. Never get the quite moments no w.My ears are ultra sensitive,I can't stand loud music anymore. These rare side effects don't seem that rare....!! Hang on in there ;-) Becky x Offering gen- eral advice Offering general, personal and medical advice and support, as well as tips for coping w ith tinnitus and hearing loss either after people have asked for ad- vice or to help other peo- ple Hi I lost some hearing and have awful tinnitus ,through Chemo. It keeps me awake at night but there are things that you can do to ease it a bit and sometimes wh en your mind isn't thinking about it you can sometimes forget it . I have attended the hearing centre in Birmingham and they gave me great advice . I have speakers in my pillows in bed that play slight white noise from an untuned radio very quietly , it rea lly helps because your ears are listening for the sounds you don't really notice the whistling of the tinnitus in your ears.it can be very relaxing . I have chemo every 21 days so mine is going to get worse but a lot of the time if you have chemo in cycles once the treatment stops it can improve . I have noticed after about 15 days I don't notice it so much but like I say mine is ongoing so it all starts over again. I hope it doesn't make your wife too irritable ,it did with me but now I just try and stay a c- tive and I know it's hard but I try not to focus on it . And for periods of the day I don't notice it. Old age Belief that hearing loss and tinnitus is from old age, not chemotherapy Just wondering how common tinnitus is after chemo for oesphageal cancer ? Mine came on just as I was finishing post op chemo , could be nothing to do with chemo ,maybe old age ! Care to share your experience ? 344 Survival mind -set Belief that prolonged life with ototoxicity and other adverse effects is better than having cancer, e.g., \"a small price to pay\", \"worth it\", focussing on the cancer first and ignor- ing the adverse effects un- til after the \"battle with cancer\" Your right Lynn, you'd have chemo if it was going to save your life and getting T as a result is a small price to pay. I had mine back in 1995 so don't know if it would have such an effect after a long period of time but it may have af- fected my hearing without me realising it. Which in turn lead to me developing T after the traumatic death of my mother. Who knows though, it may have nothing to do with it whatsoever. Will request transcript from Nic and Da- vids talk on the subject. Lesley x Withdrawal of infor- mation Withdrawing information from the medical profes- sionals such as ototoxic ef- fects due to fear of treat- ment being stopped, for- getting and other reasons Has anyone gotten tinnitus as an SE? I've had tinnitus to some degree all my life, but it got much worse (louder) dur- ing chemo and has only eased a little. I never remembered to mention it to a doc because I always had so many other SE issues, I forgot :( Professional advice Knowledge on ototoxicity from medical profession- als, and any extra medical advice and help from co n- sultants, nurses and GPs, Thanks for the replies guys. Brent, I'm an audiologist and funnily enough did a thesis on the ototoxic effect of cis- platin and carboplatin last ye ar! Dad's hearing has taken a hit and he's on meds for peripheral vertigo. He told me today he's no longer dizzy but his vision is blurred. He had noticeable nystagmus a few weeks ago but this also seems to have subsided. I don't know whether the chemo was still having an effect, but he certainly has picked up! I'm glad you're doing so well now. Lennonbeau, thanks for the suggestion of dumping syndrome. Unfortunately dad is dia- betic which adds its complications. They stopped his insulin when he wasn't eating as he was having hypos. They are reintroducing the insulin gradually now he's ea ting but now he's having consistently high sugar readings. This may also be having an effect . It's all so confusing isn't it?! Is it the cancer, a med, a combination of meds, some other un- related condition....who knows. I'm going to ring his ophthalmologis t, see if they can tweak his prescription as in my opinion, there's no harm in trying 345 Dissatisfac- tion with healthcare professionals and infor- mation pro- vided Expressing complaints about the lack of help from medical profession- als such as not being told about ototoxicity, lack of information on hearing loss, lack of Dr -patient communication, feeling ig- nored, feeling anger, not being listened to or taken seriously, I am having 4x FEC and 4x T chemotherapy. Straight after my first FEC, I started suffering from a ringing noise in both ears. Not sure whether or not it went away, but it was there all the time after my second treatment. Told my oncol- ogist. She just made a note, and sent me off for the third dose. I still have tinnitus. I was not warned about this, and don't get the impression that it matters to anyone other than me. I w ould really like to know whether there is any chance that my hearing will recover once I finish chemotherapy. Has anyone else had tinnitus and got over it? Has anyone had their treatm ent changed after informing their oncologist? If so, did it make a difference to the out- come? Carboplatin Self reports of taken car- boplatin I also have tinnitus ... it's awful. I had Taxol and Carboplatin over 13 years ago - the tinnitus appeared about 9 months ago. I suppose it could be a very delayed reaction. My friend who had the same treatment as me - at about the same time is now wearing a hearing aid. But the good thing i s we're still here! If anyone knows how to get rid of it - I'm all ears (ringing ears that is - all the time: -) Tenacity. Cisplatin Self-reports of taken cis- platin I was warned that cisplatin could cause hearing damage and, true enough I developed tinnitu s! It comes and goes but today it is bad Oxaliplatin Self-reports of taken Oxali- platin My wife started her first cycle of chemo last Tuesday, almost instantly she suffered from a runny nose (has still not stopped) and is now complaining of deafness, getting worse by the day. Is this something to be expected? The whole move from diagnosis to ac tion was very quick so we've not really had time to research let alone get to grips with what's going on. Oxaliplatin (Eloxatin) chemo questions chemo side effects 346 Non -plati- num drugs Self-reports of taken non - platinum drugs Hi, Ladies, Pulsatile tinnitus update. (Never thought at 53, I'd be writing a sentence like that...oh, don't get me started...) So this pounding in my left ear has got most everyone confounded but at least we are ruling out some of the nasty causes. I had a doppler US which showed a normal carotid artery (no blockage.) Normal hearing tests. Car- diology check up, fine. Went to the onc for my biannual check up and she wants me to keep ch ecking up on this but didn't sound that worried. Doesn't think there's a BC connection. Went back to the ENT. Physical exam of head and neck are normal but he now wants to do a head and neck MRI. He was very sweet and said he doesn't think we'll find anyth ing bad (no metasteses) but given my hx, we need to check everything. I am pretty terrified of scans post dx (diagnosed during a routine mammogram) but will be a grown up and go, as I want to be sure I've been thorough. Or as he said, get rid of that sword hanging over my head (nice of him to understand.) I have a feeling that this is due to arthritis in my neck and tight muscles. I've been spending too much time at my desk and am tense lately. Or, husband has been doing some research and says that 1% of wo men get tinnitus as an SE of Femara. Once I've ruled out any bad reasons I'll relax and chalk it up to yet another wacky Femara SE and grin and bear it. It does drive me crazy sometimes, though. Baseline hearing test carried out Baseline hearing test done before chemotherapy Emsymits, It's not you. Chemo Brain is real. Before starting treatment I had baseline hearing and vision testi ng. Af- ter 34 weeks of chemo I now need hearing aids. I have loud, non stop tinnitus. My sense of taste is deadened. I'm also getting cataracts and my eyes have become extremely sensitive to light. Bright light actually hurts my eyes and I cannot focus. I also started getting optical migraines which are not painful, but seriously affect my vision whilst oc- curring. I have short te rm memory problems. The good news is 9 months out from last chemo the headaches have nearly completely stopped. My foot neuropathy has almost entirely stopped. But hey, I'm alive and can live with many, many side effects as long as my loved ones are near and I can enjoy them! Tesla No baseline hearing test carried out No baseline hearing done before chemotherapy Hi I am having 25 raidotherapy treatments with 5 weekly sessions of chemo with cisplantin. After my first session of chemo I noticed that I got a high pitched ringing in my ears. I did mention this to my consultant at weekly review and I had a hearing test. T his test reveled little as no initial baseline test was done. After my second chemo this week my hearing loss has devel oped to such an extent that if feels like someone has their fingers in my ears! This was not a side effect that I expected! Has anyone else suffered with this? Will I get my hearing back after treatment? I will be speaking to my consultant Monday but am co ncerned that I am facing a very quiet weekend!
