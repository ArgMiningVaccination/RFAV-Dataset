The principle \"Pain up, needle down; and pain left, needle right\" meaning the acupoint selection is far from the painful area, which is the main difference compared to general acupuncture. Therefore, this takes advantage in treating acute pain or around the lesion where acupuncture is not indicated. However, there is no specific description about the implementation in Huang Di Nei Jing and not in other later ancient literatures and the current studies of acupuncture analgesia using remote acupoint selection show inconsistent and even contradictory results. There are accumulating evidences surrounding the therapeutic effect of Electroacupuncture (EA). Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid1 (TRPV1) and associated signaling pathways have been reported to be increased in inflammatory pain signaling. Local EA can reliably attenuate inflammatory pain and the increase of TRPV1 in mouse with unclear mechanisms. However, the effect of EA on distal and contralateral acupoint for pain control has been rarely studied and the result was controversial. Also, we developed Great Needling based on the theories of Same Name Meridians and Holographic Biology which are commonly adopted principles in clinical acupuncture treatment. We try to apply these methods in Great Needling with electroacupuncture to create a clear positioning theory of remote acupuncture analgesia and design further animal study assessing efficacy of analgesia with TRPV1. Here in our study, we found that inflammatory hindpaw pain in mouth, which was induced by injecting the Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA), (2.65\u00b10.34, p<0.05, n=6) for 2 days can be alleviated immediately after EA treatment (2 Hz, 15 minutes, at contralateral forefoot acupoint LI4 through both mechanic and thermal behavior tests, while sham acupoint group is not. The efficacy was observed to be more obvious after the second round of EA treatment on the following day. The expression of TRPV1 and associated signaling pathways notably increased after the CFA injection; this expression can be further attenuated significantly in EA treatment. This analgesic effect is believed to be produced by applying EA to a site remote from the painful area based on Great Needling. The present study provides a powerful experimental animal model that can be used for investigating the unique physiological mechanisms involved in acupuncture analgesia Biography Tong-Chien Wu has received his MD cum laude from China Medical University and has been devoted to clinical practice in Traditional Chinese Medicine in Taiwan.

This realization on the one hand has increased demand for herbal drugs and on the other hand need for quality standardization of drugs has gone up. The standardization of herbal drugs used in Unani system of medicine such as Sufoof Jawahir Mohra which is prescribed in Unani system for therapeutic use as tonic to multiple vital organs and stimulant to innate heat and it is useful in general weakness and weak functions of the vital organs has been taken up for standardization by modern analytical techniques, so as to ascertain its quality standard. The parameters which were carried out are organoleptic parameters, physicochemical parameters and high-performance thin layer chromatography revealing specific identities for the particular drug and to evaluate pharmacopoeia standards. Results suggest that the drug is safe for therapeutic use and the present study can be used as a reference standard for quality control in future. Biography Masroor Ali Qureshi is a Scientist L-IV in Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine (Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India).

Twenty healthy albino rats were selected randomly and divided in to five groups, each group containing four rats were administered orally at the dosage levels as Group I (Control) [Saline water, 1 ml/100 gm body wt.], Group II (Standard) [Ibuprofen solution, 100 mg/Kg body wt.], Group III (Trial) [Panchkatu, 125 mg/Kg body body [250 body V (Trial) [Panchkatu, 500 mg/Kg body wt]. The inflammatory reaction is readily produced in rats in the form of paw edema with the help of irritants. Carrageenan induced paw edema is most commonly used method in experimental pharmacology. The rats of treated Group II, III, IV and V were administered orally with Ibuprofen solution, Panchkatu 125 mg/Kg one hour before injecting 1% w/v suspension of carrageenan (0.1 ml) into the sub plantar region of left hind paw of all the five groups. Paw volume of all 20 rats were measured soon after injecting carrageenan. The volume was again measured after 1, 2, 3, 4 and 24 hours in all the five groups of rats. The change in paw volume of Group I was compared with Group II, III, IV and V Group. Also, the treated Group II, III, IV , V were also compared in between and expressed as percentage edema inhibition by the drug. Results of the present study are based on the edema of hind paw of rats of all five groups measured after 1, 2, 3, 4 and 24 hours after carrageenan injection. After one hour of carrageenan Inj both trial group Panchkatu 125 mg/Kg and Panchkatu 250 mg/Kg have equal percent inhibition of edema as with Standard group (Ibuprofen) that is 42.2% while last group (Panchkatu 500 mg/kg) has higher percent inhibition of edema (50 %) than standard (Ibuprofen) (42.2%). After two hours. of carrageenan inj there is increase in percent inhibition of edema with increase in dosage of trial drug that is Panchkatu 125 mg/Kg has 27.19%, Panchkatu 250 56.69% inhibition higher Standard (Ibuprofen) 47.24%. After three hours of Carrageenan inj there is increase in percent inhibition of edema with increase in dosage of trial drug that is Panchkatu 125 mg/Kg has 20%, Panchkatu inhibition (Ibuprofen) 39.28%. After four hours of Carrageenan inj there is again increase in percent inhibition of edema with increase in dosage of trial drug that is Panchkatu 125 mg/Kg has 25.38%, Panchkatu inhibition (Ibuprofen) 38.46%. After 24 hours of carrageenan inj there is again increase in percent inhibition of edema with increase in dosage of trial drug that is Panchkatu 125 mg/Kg has 3.22%, Panchkatu inhibition again higher than Standard (Ibuprofen) 3.22%. The maximum activity of all trial Groups was observed during first and second hours and the results are significant (P<0.005) and are comparable to standard Ibuprofen. Highest percentage edema Inhibition was seen after one and two hours. Summarizing the above it is concluded that Panchkatu has showed its extreme utility or significance on the inflammation probably because of its excellent activity of inhibiting the both early released and late released mediators which are rarely seen in any anti-inflammatory formulation.

The incidence of chronic MSD conditions is an increasing health concern on a global scale. This study adapted the methodology of Senna-Fernandes V which is based on the concept of KA, combined with physiotherapy as a systematic treatment of 205 cases of musculoskeletal disorders. KA is a multidisciplinary therapy its application is divided in three phases. Pre-Kinetic phase, acupuncture needling and balance taping medicine are applied to systemic, microsystemic or locomotor points to prepare soft tissue structures for physiotherapy by interrupting the pain-spasm-pain cycle and promoting the local blood circulation. Kinetic phase, physiotherapy is used during the stimulation of relevant acupoints to promote a synergistic effect and restore functional mobility and post-kinetic phase, biochips (bio stones) are taped over specific ear acupoints, determined by probing sites on the ear for tenderness. Overall results show KA therapeutic satisfaction to Activities of Daily Living (ADL) is 92.0%. On a four-point Likert scale, clinical improvement averaged 1.08, which indicated that most patients (76.6%) had clinically significant improvement. This study found that KA combined with balance taping minimized pain brought about by MSD. Balance taping enhanced blood circulation aligned fascial tissue and assisted in the removal of edema by directing exudates towards the lymph ducts.

This study evaluated the parental perceptions of yoga benefits in enhancing the social-emotional development of their children with disabilities. Eighteen (18) parents of individuals with disabilities participated in the online and paper survey. The survey instrument included six demographic questions and 18 close-ended Likert-scale questions. The survey was designed to collect data on the perceptions of parents about yoga benefits for their child with regards to three major components of Social-Emotional Learning (SEL): Self- regulation skills, social skills and behavior and decision-making skills. A quantitative analysis of data was utilized with the Qualtrics survey software. Descriptive statistics (i.e., percentage scores) were utilized to analyze response scores of the 18 participants. The results indicated that almost 80% of participants agreed that yoga was helpful in enhancing their child's ability to focus, stay calm, regulate their emotions and be aware of their surroundings. Almost 50% of participants disagreed that yoga had no influence on their child's ability to communicate and understand the emotions of others. Over half i.e. 63% of participants agreed that after practicing yoga, their child was more organized, flexible to changes and had improved ability to follow directions and resolve conflicts. These data suggest that yoga may be effective in enhancing the social, emotional and physical well-being of individuals with disabilities.

Gynura divaricata (GD) is a kind of natural products for edible and medicine. The analytical results showed that the methanol extract of GD riches in 10.3% 3,5- or 6.8% chlorogenic with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD). After STZ-induced type-2 diabetic mice (male ICR) were orally administered with 1%, 5% and 10% GD diet for four weeks, a series of assays was performed. The hypoglycaemic rate of fasting blood glucose (FBG) reached 41.4% in 10% GD group and the fasting serum insulin in the highest dose GD group has decreased as low as normal group. GD treatment significantly reduced the Glycosylated Serum Protein (GSP) level in diabetic mice. The activities of total Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase were markedly increased; while the Malonaldehyde (MDA) level was decreased in pancreas tissue by treatment of GD. H&E-staining showed that the pathological damage in islets was GD promoted marked -cell regeneration. in GLUT2, GK, MafA, PDX-1 and Bcl-2 as well as reduction in Bax and caspase-3 expression as shown by western blot analysis. In conclusion, GD exerts the pronounced hypoglycemic effect by restraining islet cell apoptosis and improving pancreatic function. Therefore, GD might be a promising food or medicine for the treatment of diabetes. Biography Xiao-Lu Yin is pursing Master's degree in Biology from Soochow University.

Y ou have severed your connection with Spirit. Unless you reconnect with Spirit and do so soon, you're going to bring the whole house of cards down around your heads and ours. \" Methodology and Theoretical Orientation: Our team is currently participating in a fully immersive study of sacred, ceremonial, indigenous healing techniques within a variety of South American and North American lineages. Through our studies in Brazil, Peru, Mexico, and on our home soil, the United States, we are witnessing first-hand the cultural fusion of ancient practices within modern society. Our approach arrives from three angles: Given Jaclyn Costello's background in comparative spiritual studies and creative writing, her research is shared poetically, exploring indigenous healing techniques and how they work upon one's spirit. Findings: Shamans, especially those from the Amazon are currently mounting a reverse missionary activity, hoping to heal the spiritual disconnect they witness in Westerners. Rightly or wrongly, many of these shamans believe the remedy for this disconnect to be sacred plant-medicines such as Ayahuasca, the vine of the soul. It is our collective finding that plant-medicines, such as Ayahuasca, can be used in a respectful, ceremonial fashion to help Westerners reduce anxiety, heal from trauma and harmoniously integrate all parts of themselves to build happier, more conscious and more purposeful.
