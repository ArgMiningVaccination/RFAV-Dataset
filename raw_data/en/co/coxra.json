What religion are Native Americans? The reality is that Native American religious beliefs are as diverse as the nearly hundreds of different known languages of the tribal groups in the pre-European period of America. A central tenet in all Native American religions is recognizing that all persons, places, and things have a role in maintaining harmony and balance. Native American traditions center around life cycle events (birth, adulthood, marriage, death) rooted in religious festivities and [sacrifices](https://study.com/academy/lesson/religious-sacrifice-origin-types-examples.html) aligned with agricultural or hunting seasons, depending on the group's primary food source. The combination of South and North American Native religions, cultures, and traditions creates thousands of [belief systems](https://study.com/learn/lesson/belief-system.html) that are diverse and often merge. Native American religion is orally passed from generation to generation with no primary written canon. Most writings about Native American religion came from European settlers and missionaries' encounters- with most of them biased or wrong. Complicating further the study of Native American religions is the [syncretism](https://study.com/learn/lesson/cultural-syncretism-defintion-examples-religion.html) of various religions from migration and conquest; contact with European forms of religion in North and South America influenced both Christian and Native American beliefs. The Incan (Peru) and Aztec empires (Mexico) have complex religious systems with pyramids, worship of a sun god, and a pantheon of minor gods. Their practice of human sacrifice to the sun god, Huitzilopochtli, as necessary to prevent world destruction is distinctive from other North American religious beliefs. What do Native Americans believe in regarding their beliefs? What is uniform is the belief that there is no separation between the spiritual and physical world. Interestingly, in Native American languages, the word \"religion\" is not used because a dualistic belief system separating spiritual reality from the physical does not exist. Steeped in animism (the idea that spirituality exists in all natural phenomena), people worship many Native American gods (polytheism). Their polytheistic religions led Europeans to label Native Americans with anti-Christian labels: pagan, witches, demonic, and barbaric. One of the stated objectives of the Spanish conquistador's missions into the \"New World\" was to convert the indigenous people to Roman Catholicism through settlements, intermarriages, forced labor, and church teachings. The long-term result was the emergence of Spanish Catholicism, holding to certain tenets of Roman Catholicism while incorporating some of the Native American spiritual beliefs and practices. Although widely diverse in spiritual beliefs because of geography, food sources, and environment, certain beliefs are evident in each. They include: Some of the Native American gods are listed below in the following categories: of spirituality. The \"Great Spirit\" rules and cares for the world by extending his power to a pantheon of more minor deities known collectively as the \"Invisible Agents.\" One of the best-known agents was \"Thunderbolt,\" who controlled the weather. A counterpart to the \"Great Spirit\" is his brother, \"Evil Minded.\" \"Evil Minded\" rules his independent pantheon of evil deities and spirits that bring evil and suffering to the world. \"The Great Spirit\" does not have sovereign control over \"Evil-Minded\" but has enough power to stop \"Evil-Minded\" occasionally and his cohorts. It is up to the individual to decide which one to follow. In death, a follower of the \"Evil-Minded\" will be judged, whereas a follower of the Great Spirit\" will have immortality. Native American language does not have the word \"religion.\" To the Native Americans, there was no separation between the spiritual and physical world. Life was a journey or a path with everything (i.e., law, government, social, medicine, nature, art, music, dance), not separate spheres but part of the whole journey. Traditions and religion are linked because religious symbolism and ceremonies are inspired by nature. The norms and ethics are derived from making a respectful, productive, and sustainable livelihood from that landscape. For people dependent upon fish for subsistence, religious symbols and sacrifices, ceremonies, dances, and traditions center around the spawning season for fish. The fish are prayed over for giving their lives. The gods of the rivers are praised for their provisions. The traditions are orally passed down from one generation to the next becoming the accepted customs of the culture. This pass-down process would be the same for people dependent upon hunting or agriculture. The names of the gods, symbols, and calendars may differ, but the traditions and customs are created the same way in those communities. Since traditions are central to all Native American groups, it is not surprising that deep respect for ancestors exists. It is more than genealogy but part of the continual life journey since the beginning of time. Honoring traditions, customs, and ancestors is essential to keeping harmony in the three worlds. The Hopi people trace their descendants back to the earliest settlers of the Southwest in modern-day Arizona, filled with elk and deer, nuts, berries, roots, and soil conditions to grow a variety of vegetables. The Hopi people believe they used to live underground because their immorality and discord had disrupted the first and second worlds. With an impending apocalypse, they, along with the animals in the Underworld, decided to venture to the Fourth World to live. Emerging from the Underworld (3rd world), they encounter the Creation god \"Masau-u\" and agree to live by his sacred rules and teachings, offer rituals and sacrifices to him for water, and treat the land as sacred. In return, the\" kachinas\" (ancestral spirits in animal form) would provide the crops and water. Over time, the accumulated rituals and ceremonies to appease \"Masau-u\" and the \"kachina's\" spirits became integral to their traditions and culture. The Hopi people are divided into twelve \"phratries\" (clans), each having its unique sacred object and ceremonies to gain favor with the \"kachinas.\" Children of the \"'phratries\" trace their lineage through their mothers. The groups participate in the kivas, underground chambers requiring a ladder to enter and exit. The ladder is symbolic of the gap between the 3rd and 4th world. They also celebrate the winter solstice (\"Soyai\") to receive a blessing in the coming year. The Cherokee people, part of the Iroquoian people, were forced to leave the Great Lakes region due to continual fighting with other tribes and moved to the Southeast (Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia). Agarian-based, they established seventy independent towns united by their language and led by \"matrilineal\" clans giving them the power to overcome conflicts with other Native American tribes (Creek, Delaware, Shawnee) and to establish treaties with white settlers. They readily accepted European technologies and government (clans transformed into a representative council). The Cherokee people believe the earth is a flat island hanging from a stone arch in the heavens connected to the four corners of the planet. They believe in a Three-World System. Humans, animals, and plants living in the This World level need protection from the workings of the \"Under World\" that enters through springs, lakes, and caves. Prayers, rituals, and ceremonies are offered for protection from these evil spirits. One particular cleansing ritual, \"The going to water,\" performed at sunrise at the New Moon, following illness, and bad weather, involves the community facing east and dipping into the river or creek seven times. The Green Corn Ceremony, a harvest festival, involves burning new corn from the previous harvest in a sacred fire. The fire is put out, and a new fire is started while the community gives thanks, forgiving personal grievances and all crimes (except murder). The women present fresh corn to begin the feast. The [Lakota people](https://study.com/learn/lesson/lakota-sioux-people-history-facts.html) (Standing Rock, Great Sioux Nation) form three distinct based on languages and geography: Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota. The seven councils first comprised the seven tribal bands among the groups, with the Great Sioux Nation as the largest. The Lakota Group (17th century) left their Mississipi-based civilization after losing major tribal wars over the fur trade, settling in modern-day South Dakota. When the Cheyenne (18th century) introduced horses to the Lakota people, it transformed their whole society. Horses, known as \"dogs,\" led to the emergence of the \"Dog Pony\" warrior class society. They used their skills in buffalo hunting and pillaging and conquering other nearby tribes, including the Cheyenne. Their conquest firmly established the Great Plains as their home. Their spirituality focuses on Wakan Tanka (Great Spirit or Great Mystery), who created the universe. Like most Native American people, they were animists. The Cannupa Waka (sacred pipe) and the smoke contain messages from Wakan Tanka. Holy Men and Women communicate to the pantheon of spirits through interpretative dance, drums, and prayers. They believe it honorable to die as a warrior in battle rather than natural causes and in the soul's immortality. The Renewal of Life rite, one of the Seven Sacred Rites, is held in a sweat lodge (symbolic of re-entering the womb), where water is poured on heated rocks to produce steam during prayers to lead to physical and emotional, or spiritual healing. The buffalo (Tatanka) was central to Lakota society. Using every part of the buffalo for physical needs gave the sacred buffalo status. In all the Lakota holy rites, the buffalo symbol was used. The birth of a white buffalo calf indicated prosperity. Part of the rite into adulthood was a pilgrimage to the buffalo herd to pray and give offerings. The aboriginal Inuit people inhabit a 12,000-mile section of the Arctic from Siberia, the Alaskan coast, parts of Canada, and Greenland. The [Inuit](https://study.com/learn/lesson/inuit-mythology-gods-goddesses.html) are closely related to the Mongoloid peoples of eastern Asia, only arriving in North America about 4,000 years ago. Their society was nomadic based on following the hunting seasons for whales (early spring), seals (spring), caribou (summer), and fishing (autumn). Each season ended with celebratory festivals. In the summer, fair trades gathered the commonly isolated groups together. Distinctive from other Native American tribes, the Inuit place more emphasis on family ties than clans. Names of newborns are given to those family members who were dead. The Inuit people were animists, particularly interested in keeping balance with hunted animals (polar bears, walruses, seals, and whales). A sacred rite of a boy entering adulthood involves a holy feast honoring his first kill and the animal who was killed. Inuit believe in the soul's immortality, believing it to be a joyful reunion with ancestors dancing in the aurora borealis. The trickster spirit (Tikigaq Inuit) is integral to their oral spiritual tradition, with the Raven symbol prominent in most Inuit sacred ceremonies. The study of the religions and traditions of Native Americans is complex because their beliefs and practices are many and not a singular Native American religion. Life cycle events (rooted in religious festivities and sacrifices are central to Native American traditions. What makes the spiritual beliefs of the Aztec people different from other North American religious beliefs is the human sacrifices to their sun god, Huitzilopochtli, to stop world destruction. All Native American people worshiped many Native American gods. Though their spiritual beliefs vary depending upon their environmental conditions and food sources, their views of a hierarchy of gods and spirits creating the universe and protecting against evil are similar. The word religion does not appear in Native American languages because they believe all of life is a sacred journey of maintaining harmony and equality between the spiritual and the physical nature.

It is as diverse as the hundreds of tribes in North and South America up through the eighteenth century. Native American languages do not have a term for \"religion.\" Spirituality for virtually all the tribes views life as a journey on earth maintaining balance and equality with the universe. It is essential to keep the gods and spirits appeased to prevent bad weather and illnesses and to have a happy eternal life. Spiritual beliefs include the belief in a creator(s) who design a multi-world system where all things created, including inanimate objects, have spirits. Humans, who are equal to everything else created, must seek to maintain balance and harmony by living according to the teachings and commands handed down by their ancestors from the creator(s). An afterlife awaits those who live in balance with the world. Native American belief systems differ in the names of their gods, spirits, spiritual leaders, and practices. The sacrifices range from human, vegetable, and animal types to the different seasons. Their view of the universe structure differs, with some believing in a single Creator or many creators of a multiple world system. Native American people's belief structure usually centers around a central primary God served by a pantheon of gods and spirits. There is typically a counterpart to God, an evil presence, or nature that controls its pantheon of spirits. Already a member?
