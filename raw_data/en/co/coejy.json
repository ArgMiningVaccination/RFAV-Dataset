A paper published in 2012 suggested that around half of people with cancer use some sort of complementary therapy, at some time during their illness. There is no evidence to suggest that any type of complementary therapy prevents or cures cancer. For some therapies there is very little research evidence to show that they help with certain symptoms. For example, pain or hot flushes. But there is research going on and we are starting to collect evidence for some types of therapy. Using therapies to help you feel better People often use complementary therapies to help them feel better. And cope with having cancer and treatment. How you feel plays a part in how you cope. Many complementary therapies concentrate on relaxation and reducing stress. They might help to: - calm your emotions - relieve anxiety - increase your general sense of health and well being Many doctors, cancer nurses and researchers are interested in the idea that positive emotions can improve your health. Reducing symptoms or side effects There is growing evidence that certain complementary therapies can help to control some symptoms of cancer. And treatment side effects. For example, acupuncture can help to relieve sickness caused by some chemotherapy drugs. Or, it can help relieve a sore mouth after having treatment for head and neck cancer. Acupuncture can also help to relieve pain after surgery to remove lymph nodes in the neck. Feeling more in control Sometimes it might feel as though your doctor makes many of the decisions about your treatment. It can feel like you don't have much control over what happens to you. Many people say complementary therapy lets them take a more active role in their treatment and recovery. This is in partnership with their therapist. Natural and healing therapies Many patients like the idea that complementary therapies seem natural and non toxic. Some complementary therapies can help with specific symptoms or side effects. But we don't know much about how they might interact with conventional treatments like cancer drugs or radiotherapy. Some types of complementary or alternative medicine might make conventional treatment work less well. And some might increase side effects. Comfort from touch, talk and time Some people might get a lot of comfort and satisfaction from the touch, talk and time that a complementary therapist usually offers. A good therapist can play a supportive role during cancer treatment and recovery. For example, a skilled and caring aromatherapist can take the time to make you feel cared for. This might help improve your quality of life. Staying positive Having a positive outlook is an important part of coping with cancer for most people. It is normal to want and hope for a cure. Even if your doctor suggests that this might be difficult. Some people use complementary therapies as a way to feel positive and hopeful for the future. Boosting your immune system There are claims that certain complementary therapies can boost their immune system and help fight cancer. There is evidence that feeling good and reducing stress boosts the immune system. But doctors don't know if this can help the body to control cancer. There are clinical trials looking at how certain complementary therapies might affect the immune system. Looking for a cure Some people believe that using specific alternative therapies instead of conventional cancer treatment might help control or cure their cancer. There are also people who promote alternative therapies in this way. Using alternative therapy can become more important to people with advanced cancer if their conventional treatment is no longer helping to control it. It is understandable that they hope that alternative therapies might work. But, there is no scientific evidence to prove that any type of alternative therapy can help to control or cure cancer. Some alternative therapies might be unsafe and can cause harmful side effects. "}
