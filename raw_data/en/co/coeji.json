With so many positive effects on the body, make time to head outside and take off your shoes! The Earth, according to the spiritual health site [ Chopra](https://chopra.com/articles/grounding-the-human-body-the-healing-benefits-of-earthing), is one giant battery with its own negative charge. You too are electrical, with your very own cells transmitting to your heart, nervous, and immune systems. Yet modern living has disconnected many from the healing electrical currents of the earth.

This was connected to a wire that led to a metal rod placed in the earth outside. Participants slept better when they were grounded and also reported a reduction in pain and stress. Grounding reduces pain According to a [ study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4378297/#b5-jir-8-083) published in the Journal of Inflammation Research, when you ground, mobile electrons from the Earth make contact with your skin and enter your body, acting as natural [antioxidants](/articles/7-smartest-brain-foods). They protect cells, tissue, and organs from oxidative stress. People with muscle soreness who slept on a grounding system experienced a reduction in [ inflammation](/articles/10-unexpected-benefits-spending-time-in-nature) according to a [ study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20192911/) in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine.
