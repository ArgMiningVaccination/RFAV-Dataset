TRC offers detoxification services on an inpatient as well as ambulatory basis. Consumers are screened and assessed for appropriate level of care for detoxification treatment. TRC's inpatient program is designed to help individuals achieve detoxification from alcohol and other drugs. Our team of experienced doctors, nurses, and case managers help individuals begin their recovery in a supportive and caring atmosphere. A thorough and professional intake evaluation of each patient's specific needs allows our professionals to suggest and formulate a treatment plan with the maximum therapeutic benefits .Our Medical Director and the team of nurses determines the best possible care for our consumer. Our goal is to provide a safe medical detoxification. Our average length of stay in inpatient detoxification is about 10 days. TRC's Ambulatory Detoxification Program is an outpatient model for individuals requiring detoxification from drugs and alcohol. The program is unique in that it provides many of the benefits of inpatient detoxification but in a setting that is more cost effective and less restrictive. Physician, nursing staff, case managers and licensed therapists assure the consumer has their needs addressed in a very comfortable and individualized manner. The substances the consumers are generally detoxified from are: - Alcohol - Alcohol withdrawal is a potentially life threatening condition that may require medication during withdrawal period. - Opiates [including Heroin, opiate withdrawal, we use a combination of medications which generally make symptoms manageable. We tailor our approach to the specific needs of each patient, so not all individuals will receive the same medication regimen. Opiate detoxification also includes options of buprenorphine (Suboxone/Subutex) use in opiate withdrawal syndrome to help patients stabilize through the induction and withdrawal phase. Referrals are given to continue with maintenance dosing of buprenorphine as indicated and agreed by the patient. - Sedatives (including Klonopin, Xanax, Valium, Ativan, Librium, etc.). For sedative withdrawal, we begin tapering the individual from their current sedative dose. There are specific detoxification protocols designed to address various withdrawal symptoms during the process. Sedative withdrawal can be a lengthy process. For the following substances: Cocaine, Methamphetamine, Marijuana, Hallucinogens, Club Drugs, etc., we provide detoxification based on Medical necessity.
