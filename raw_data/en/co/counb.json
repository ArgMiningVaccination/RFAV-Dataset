Statistics will be mentioned on how many individuals actually utilize CAM, as well as the success of the form. Students will also compare CAM methods to modern medicine and learn how to pick a reputable CAM professional. Lastly, a unique assignment will be described and completed before the last lecture. LessonContent: Common Forms of CAM: Utilization of natural products. o Herbs, Vitamins, Supplement. Deep breathing. o Mindful exercise to see that breaths have the power to change situations.

CAM is greater in women with substantial income. 75 out of 125 medical schools are beginning to teach CAM. CAM versus Modern Medicine: Majority of doctors will not recommend CAM methods to a patient. o Modern medicine has advanced through scientific studies. o Some doctors feel the CAM practice lacks enough evidence to refer. Patients are starting to become much more aware of medication risks. o Starting to question if the doctor is truly giving his or her best advice in regards to the patient's condition. o Doctors are too quick to recommended medication without all the facts.

How to Select a CAM Provider: First, a patient can check to see if their primary doctor has any referral suggestions. Search for the practitioner's education, training, licenses, certificate, and philosophy. Check if the practitioner accepts insurance at all. o Do not be surprised if they don't. Feel free to tell your primary provider about the holistic steps you're taken as it keeps you in control of your care. Conclusion: At the conclusion of today's class, students should know the most common forms of CAM used. Students should be able to reiterate which population use CAM the most.

Discussion will occur of last week's assignment where the students had to try a new CAM form and write a one page journal. The students will switch with at least one other person and read the experience their peer had trying a new CAM practice. A quick and final comprehensive quiz will occur, as well as an end of class survey. Any additional questions about the course may be addressed. LessonContent: CAM Systems in Depth: Ancient healing systems. o Originated in India more than 3,000 years ago. o Ayur=life Veda=science or knowledge. o Engages proper use of one's senses. o Provides ideally behavior. o Describes three energies: movement, transformation, and structure of fire, wind, and earth. o One must become in tune with his or her primary energy to remain balanced, creative, and free. o When energy is unbalanced dry skin, bowel issues, congestion and other symptoms occur. Homeopathy. o Developed in Germany in 18th century. o Remedies come from plants, minerals, or animals. o Only uses in minute doses. o Example: Bee pollen or red onion. o Majority of remedies are formed into sugar pellets and placed under the tongue. o Treatments are individualized based on patient's condition. Naturopathy. o Originated in Europe in the 19th century. o Holistic systems based on the power of nature. o Focuses on internal self-healing processes. o Emphasizes prevention and optimal health. o Uses modern, traditional, and scientific approaches. o Example: psychotherapy, manipulative therapies, and lifestyle changes. o Physicians must complete a 4 year graduate-level program by an accredited Naturopathic organization in addition to lengthy training programs in order to receive a license. Lack of CAM Evidence: Been around for thousands of years but does not contain a ton of scientific research. Holistic treatments are highly individualized, so it is hard to obtain specific results, especially in rigorous clinical research. Holistic approaches are still controversial compared to modern medicine. There are some controlled, randomized studies which show CAM as a reliable approach. Natural does not always mean safe. Some mismarked and labeled safe products cause problems in combination with other medicine or in the wrong dosage. Watch out for scams such as products that cure or target a specific obesity related medical condition. Always ask questions and seek professional help if unsure of a certain product or tactic. Conclusion: At the conclusion of today's class, students should be able to reiterate basic components and structure of CAM approaches. Students should be able to tell the difference between CAM methods and explain the lack of CAM evidence. Today's lecture completes the Complementary and Alternative Medicine course. Students may wish to continue practicing the CAM approach they journaled about or even try a new one. To conclude, the students should now have a better understanding of what Complementary and Alternative medicine entails. Reference: National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.
