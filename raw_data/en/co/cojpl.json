[ (For recommendations on my most popular supplements, visit my store page.)](https://drhoffman.com/dr-hoffmans-store/) To your health! Dr. Ronald Hoffman [The Intelligent Medicine Starter Kit: ](https://drhoffman.com/intelligent-medicine-starter-kit/)This protocol combines Dr. Hoffman's must-have supplements for good health into one package. Consider this kit the basic building blocks of your supplement regimen. [The Intelligent Medicine Immune Protocol:](https://drhoffman.com/seasonal-immune-support-protocol/) Illness is on many people's minds these days. Protect yourself with our Immune Protocol and give your body an additional line of protection against all of the things mother nature throws at us. [The Intelligent Medicine Heart Health Protocol: ](https://drhoffman.com/heart-health-protocol/)Heart-related health issues are some of the most common concerns of my patients and listeners alike. In Heart Health Protocol, you'll find targeted supplements to help keep your cardiovascular system running smoothly. [The Intelligent Medicine Detox Protocol:](https://drhoffman.com/detox-protocol/) Simply opting for healthier clean foods is a great first step, but studies show that as caloric restriction causes fat cells to shrink, they release stored toxins into the system. The supplements in my Detox protocol have been chosen carefully to mobilize toxin elimination, easing the \"blahs\" that sometimes compromise your dietary resolve and get in the way of permanent sustainable weight loss. [The Intelligent Medicine Bone Health Protocol: ](https://drhoffman.com/bone-health-protocol/)The process of keeping our bones healthy spans a broad range of medical and lifestyle issues, but luckily there are several plausible ways of forestalling, and even reversing, bone loss: Weight-bearing exercise, yoga, an anti-inflammatory diet, and the right combination of supplements. The Intelligent Medicine Bone Health Protocol contains the supplements you need to develop and maintain a strong skeletal foundation. [The Intelligent Medicine Brain Health Protocol:](https://drhoffman.com/brain-support-protocol/) There's a natural decline in short-term memory and learning ability with age - a slow, progressive decline. It has even earned a medical acronym: ARMI, for age-related memory impairment. The good news is that several nutrients and nutraceuticals have been shown to slow cognitive decline and enhance memory and mental performance. I have aggregated some of the best into my Brain Support Protocol.
