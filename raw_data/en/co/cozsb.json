Ayurveda is a very effective alternative system of medicine prevailing since ancient times with its origins in India. In Ayurveda, the high blood pressure condition is known as RaktaGata Vata. If you are looking for natural ways to lower blood pressure, Ayurveda can help you the best as it involves natural healing methods with healthy lifestyle practices and herbs. A sedentary lifestyle, excess intake of salt, unhealthy diet, obesity, and alcohol consumption are some common reasons that cause hypertension these days. This leads to the development of toxin (ama) and the narrowing of the blood vessels. So, the circulating blood ends up exerting greater pressure, thereby making you suffer from high blood pressure. Ayurveda also believes in the effect of doshas on the human body. Its three-dosha theory explains how fluctuations in the qualities and quantities of three basic substances, namely bile (Pitta), phlegm (Kapha), and wind (Vata), affect your health. Ayurveda believes that vitiation of Vata dosha is the prime cause of the development of high blood pressure. Dietary and lifestyle modifications can help manage the condition effectively and safely with no adverse effects. Here are some Ayurvedic approaches that can help you lower your blood pressure naturally. - Follow The Right Diet: Going for a nutritious diet comprising fresh fruits and vegetables and reducing your intake of salt and fats can help you achieve a healthy balance of doshas and manage hypertension naturally.

At the same time, you should avoid eating processed foods which are loaded with preservatives, trans fats, and salt. A low-sodium diet can help you mitigate your blood pressure levels. Due to the active and light aspects of Vata dosha, you should avoid excessive exposure to dietary stimulants. You should also quit smoking, curb chewing tobacco, and restrict or avoid the intake of alcohol. Consulting a certified dietician can help you have a customised diet plan for high blood pressure to manage the condition smoothly and naturally. - Adopt Healthy Daily Routine: Lifestyle modifications can do wonders for hypertension management. Meal timings, sleeping schedules, and physical activity all play a crucial role in managing your blood pressure levels. You should focus on a healthy routine with well-planned schedules, which should sync properly with the ebb and flow of doshas. Ayurveda can help you focus on strengthening your circadian rhythm with healthy modifications in your lifestyle habits. Having meals on time, getting adequate continuous sleep for 7 to 8 hours daily at night, following a mild to moderate exercise routine, and having sufficient rest are some natural ways to lower blood pressure. - Practice Yoga: Yoga has a great significance in managing hypertension with Ayurveda. It offers a psychological and spiritual base in Ayurvedic applications.

Tadasana, Badhakonasana, Bhujangasana, Paschimottanasana, and Sukhasana are some yoga poses that can help you manage hypertension smoothly and effectively. - Do Meditation: Meditation is a crucial technique which helps achieve good inner balance, alleviates stress, and aids in hypertension management.
