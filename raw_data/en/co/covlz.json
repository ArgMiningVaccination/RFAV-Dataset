Development of these skills during the education process could lead to more culturally competent care. [3](#b3-jeehp-16-04)- [6](#b6-jeehp-16-04)]. According to the results of those studies, cultural competency training can improve skills, knowledge, and attitudes among healthcare professionals, leading to improved patient satisfaction and outcomes [ [3](#b3-jeehp-16-04)- [6](#b6-jeehp-16-04)]. Educational experiences directed specifically at the development of cultural competency among students of the health professions are an integral part of professional education. Methods [7](#b7-jeehp-16-04)]. Eligibility criteria Information sources/search Study selection [Table 1](#t1-jeehp-16-04)presents a summative analysis of the studies included. Data collection process and data items [8](#b8-jeehp-16-04)]. The affective domain was defined as learning involving feelings or emotions [ [8](#b8-jeehp-16-04)]. The perceptual domain was defined as learning that influenced the participant's awareness of his or her surroundings through senses and/or spirituality [ [8](#b8-jeehp-16-04)]. Cultural dissonance was defined as a lack of agreement with the culture in which the participant was immersed [ [8](#b8-jeehp-16-04)]. The skills/engagement domain was defined as engagement with a culturally different native population and/or skills gained through those engagements [ [9](#b9-jeehp-16-04)]. Risk of bias assessment [10](#b10-jeehp-16-04)]. The MMAT is an instrument constructed to appraise the quality of qualitative studies, with a scoring procedure outlined in section 1 of the instrument. The qualitative portion of the MMAT assesses each article in 4 categories, resulting in a percentage score of quality. The categories include an assessment of the sources used within each article, the process used to analyze the data, consideration of how the results related to the context, and consideration of how the results related to the researcher's influence. The authors discussed the quality criteria and applied them to each of the articles to obtain a quality score. Results Study selection [Fig. 1](#f1-jeehp-16-04). A total of 126 articles were identified through the electronic search. After the title screen, 74 articles remained. Following review of the abstracts, 30 articles were eliminated, leaving 44 for review. Three of these were removed due to duplication within the databases, leaving 41 articles for consideration using the inclusion/exclusion criteria. After full-text review, 9 studies were selected for inclusion. Study characteristics [Table 1](#t1-jeehp-16-04)). The individualized outcomes of the studies revealed 47 unique themes. These themes were analyzed and organized into 5 overarching domains that were identified by the researchers through qualitative methodology. [Table 2](#t2-jeehp-16-04)outlines how the themes fit into the overarching domains. The results from 2 of the articles showed growth among the participants in all 5 of the domains, and 2 other articles showed participant growth in 4 of the domains. Three of the articles demonstrated participant growth in 3 of the domains, and 2 others showed participant growth in 2 of the domains. The most prevalent type of growth seen among the participants was related to the perceptual domain, with 15 of the original individual themes falling under this designation. Six of the original individual themes were categorized into the skills/engagement domain, indicating that this was least prevalent learning experience as a result of immersion. Risk of bias [Table 3](#t3-jeehp-16-04). Four articles received a score of 100% on the MMAT, indicating a low risk of bias. Five articles received a score of 75%, indicating that the articles did not meet 1 of the criteria within the assessment tool. The mean score was 86.11%, signifying a high overall quality score. Five overarching domains [8](#b8-jeehp-16-04), [9](#b9-jeehp-16-04), [11](#b11-jeehp-16-04)- [15](#b15-jeehp-16-04)]. In those studies, the authors identified 9 emerging themes related to learning and growing at a cognitive level based on the participants' reflections. Some of the participants explained that they experienced cognitive growth through improved knowledge, understanding, and realization of cultural differences [ [8](#b8-jeehp-16-04), [9](#b9-jeehp-16-04), [11](#b11-jeehp-16-04), [12](#b12-jeehp-16-04), [14](#b14-jeehp-16-04)]. Others expressed an increase in consciousness and self-awareness leading to a desire to learn more about cultural differences [ [11](#b11-jeehp-16-04)- [13](#b13-jeehp-16-04), [15](#b15-jeehp-16-04)]. In addition to the purely cognitive act of learning, participants expressed that increased knowledge and understanding occurred through interacting and building connections with the people and communities in which they worked [ [8](#b8-jeehp-16-04), [9](#b9-jeehp-16-04), [14](#b14-jeehp-16-04)]. [8](#b8-jeehp-16-04), [13](#b13-jeehp-16-04)- [16](#b16-jeehp-16-04)]. Within these studies, 9 emerging themes reflected affective learning. A broad spectrum of emotional growth took place among the participants. Some expressed feeling a greater sense of appreciation and gratitude for their own standard of living [ [13](#b13-jeehp-16-04)- [16](#b16-jeehp-16-04)]. Many reported gaining a renewed passion and sense of purpose in their field of study [ [13](#b13-jeehp-16-04)- [15](#b15-jeehp-16-04)]. Not all learning was associated with positive emotions, with some participants expressing mixtures of anger, sadness, and shame [ [8](#b8-jeehp-16-04), [14](#b14-jeehp-16-04), [15](#b15-jeehp-16-04)]. [8](#b8-jeehp-16-04), [9](#b9-jeehp-16-04), [11](#b11-jeehp-16-04)- [17](#b17-jeehp-16-04)]. After having been outsiders in a foreign country or culture, participants reported having a newfound ability to examine the validity of intrinsic values, socio-political issues, and privileges of their own societies [ [9](#b9-jeehp-16-04), [11](#b11-jeehp-16-04)- [13](#b13-jeehp-16-04), [15](#b15-jeehp-16-04), [16](#b16-jeehp-16-04)]. They became more aware of negative issues such as poverty, sub-standard living environments, racial segregation, discrimination, and inequity [ [11](#b11-jeehp-16-04), [13](#b13-jeehp-16-04), [14](#b14-jeehp-16-04)]. Participants described an increased sense of connection among body, spirit, mind, and the world around them [ [8](#b8-jeehp-16-04), [9](#b9-jeehp-16-04), [15](#b15-jeehp-16-04)- [17](#b17-jeehp-16-04)]. The immersion experience allowed students to discern an increased ability to approach others different from themselves [ [16](#b16-jeehp-16-04)]. Increased perceptiveness led to increased openness, appreciation of basic necessities, and decreased prejudice [ [12](#b12-jeehp-16-04), [14](#b14-jeehp-16-04), [17](#b17-jeehp-16-04)]. Students reported a heightened awareness of preconceived unprocessed feelings, and insecurities [ [9](#b9-jeehp-16-04), [11](#b11-jeehp-16-04), [15](#b15-jeehp-16-04), [16](#b16-jeehp-16-04)]. Through observation of unfamiliar customs, participants reported an improved outlook on the importance and value of cultural differences [ [16](#b16-jeehp-16-04)]. [8](#b8-jeehp-16-04), [12](#b12-jeehp-16-04), [14](#b14-jeehp-16-04), [15](#b15-jeehp-16-04), [17](#b17-jeehp-16-04)]. Eight emerging themes were related to disagreements with the cultures in which the participants were immersed. Participants reported frustration with the constraints of western medicine related to its negative view towards alternative medicine [ [17](#b17-jeehp-16-04)]. Some participants experienced feelings of apprehension due to language barriers, unsafe drinking water, and obstacles such as ethnocentricity [ [12](#b12-jeehp-16-04), [14](#b14-jeehp-16-04), [15](#b15-jeehp-16-04)]. Cultural dissonance was shown in the immersion experiences through displays of stereotyping, judgment of others, and avoidance of reflecting on issues of diversity [ [8](#b8-jeehp-16-04)]. As part of their experiences of a foreign environment, participants described negative psychological or behavioral changes, such as difficulty coping, insomnia, uncertainty, anticipation, fatigue, and even physical illness [ [12](#b12-jeehp-16-04), [15](#b15-jeehp-16-04)]. [9](#b9-jeehp-16-04), [13](#b13-jeehp-16-04)- [15](#b15-jeehp-16-04), [17](#b17-jeehp-16-04)]. Some participants reported connecting with the local populations through engagement with the people and their customs [ [19](#b19-jeehp-16-04), [13](#b13-jeehp-16-04)- [15](#b15-jeehp-16-04)]. Students reported an emergent desire to incorporate some of the local practices into their daily lives [ [9](#b9-jeehp-16-04), [14](#b14-jeehp-16-04), [17](#b17-jeehp-16-04)]. Some participants reported sensing an internal change resulting from personal engagement with the population in which they were immersed. This type of reflective self-assessment could benefit future healthcare endeavors [ [9](#b9-jeehp-16-04), [14](#b14-jeehp-16-04), [15](#b15-jeehp-16-04)]. Discussion [18](#b18-jeehp-16-04)], Tomlinson-Clarke and Clarke [ [19](#b19-jeehp-16-04)], and Charles et al. [ [20](#b20-jeehp-16-04)], all of whom reported that improved cultural awareness and sensitivity followed cultural immersion experiences. A systematic review conducted by Clifford et al. [ [21](#b21-jeehp-16-04)] reported an increase in cultural competency through knowledge, attitudes, and awareness, indicating growth in the cognitive, affective, and perceptual domains following immersion experiences. Work by Tremethick and Smit [ [22](#b22-jeehp-16-04)] and Conroy and Taggart [ [23](#b23-jeehp-16-04)] reported the importance of cultural immersion in the preparation of culturally competent healthcare professionals for the development of clinical and interpersonal skills, suggesting that immersion experiences may lead to improved patient care.
