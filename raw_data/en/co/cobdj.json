Recent research has shown that spending time in green spaces\u2014that is, outdoors\u2014can help to alleviate the symptoms of chronic stress, a common trigger for bipolar mood episodes. Here's how you can breathe some fresh air into your bipolar treatment plan. #1 Awaken the Senses When we allow nature to perk up all of our senses by taking a hike through the woods (without being distracted by our smartphone), we are able to open our minds up to hyper-awareness. This is when our hearing becomes more acute and we can appreciate every audible nuance of a nearby creek; we can actually smell the earth, moss, and pine needles. \"Nature can be beneficial for mental health,\" says Irina Wen, PhD, clinical psychologist and clinical director of the Steven A. Military Family Clinic at NYU Langone Medical Center. \"It reduces cognitive fatigue and stress and can be helpful with depression and anxiety.\" #2 Clear Out the Cortisol with \"Forest Bathing\" Studies show that \"forest bathing\"\u2014spending time in a forested area\u2014is good for your mental well-being. A 2010 study published in Environmental Health and Preventive Medicine found that \"by simply walking in a forest, participants had lower blood pressure and levels of cortisol (the stress hormone) afterwards than those who strolled through a city environment.\" #3 Discover the Benefits of \"Earthing\" or \"Grounding\" Spend just 30 minutes barefoot outside and feel the difference in your stress level. According to research published in the Journal of Inflammation Research, you can walk on grass, sand, or dirt to discover how you can use conduction of the Earth, a source of free electrons, to neutralize the free radicals in your body that cause disease and cellular destruction. Try doing yoga or a meditation session out in nature, and you'll never want to do either inside again. 20 Minutes in Nature Can Reduce Stress April 4, 2019, Ann Arbor, MI\u2014Taking at least twenty minutes out of your day to stroll or sit in a place that makes you feel in contact with nature will significantly lower your stress hormone levels. That's the finding of a study that has established, for the first time, the most effective dose of an urban nature experience. Healthcare practitioners can use this discovery, published in Frontiers in Psychology, to prescribe \"nature-pills\" in the knowledge that they have a real measurable effect. \"We know that spending time in nature reduces stress, but until now it was unclear how much is enough, how often to do it, or even what kind of nature experience will benefit us,\" says Dr. MaryCarol Hunter, an associate professor at the University of Michigan and lead author of this research. \"Our study shows that for the greatest payoff, in terms of efficiently lowering levels of the stress hormone cortisol, you should spend 20 to 30 minutes sitting or walking in a place that provides you with a sense of nature.\" A Free & Natural Stress-Relieving Remedy Nature pills could be a low-cost solution to reduce the negative health impacts stemming from growing urbanization and indoor lifestyles dominated by screen viewing. To assist healthcare practitioners looking for evidence-based guidelines on what exactly to dispense, Hunter and her colleagues designed an experiment that would give a realistic estimate of an effective dose. Over an 8-week period, participants were asked to take a nature pill with a duration of 10 minutes or more, at least 3 times a week. Levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, were measured from saliva samples taken before and after a nature pill, once every two weeks. \"Participants were free to choose the time of day, duration, and the place of their nature experience, which was defined as anywhere outside that in the opinion of the participant, made them feel like they've interacted with nature. There were a few constraints to minimize factors known to influence stress: take the nature pill in daylight, no aerobic exercise, and avoid the use of social media, internet, phone calls, conversations and reading,\" Hunter explains. She continues, \"Building personal flexibility into the experiment, allowed us to identify the optimal duration of a nature pill, no matter when or where it is taken, and under the normal circumstances of modern life, with its unpredictability and hectic scheduling.\" To make allowances for busy lifestyles, while also providing meaningful results, the experimental design was novel in other aspects too. \"We accommodated day to day differences in a participant's stress status by collecting four snapshots of cortisol change due to a nature pill,\" says Hunter. \"It also allowed us to identify and account for the impact of the ongoing, natural drop in cortisol level as the day goes on, making the estimate of effective duration more reliable.\" Nature Will Nurture The data revealed that just a twenty-minute nature experience was enough to significantly reduce cortisol levels. But if you spent a little more time immersed in a nature experience, 20 to 30 minutes sitting or walking, cortisol levels dropped at their greatest rate. After that, additional de-stressing benefits continue to add up but at a slower rate. \"Healthcare practitioners can use our results as an evidence-based rule of thumb on what to put in a nature-pill prescription,\" says Hunter. \"It provides the first estimates of how nature experiences impact stress levels in the context of normal daily life. It breaks new ground by addressing some of the complexities of measuring an effective nature dose.\" Hunter hopes this study will form the basis of further research in this area. \"Our experimental approach can be used as a tool to assess how age, gender, seasonality, physical ability, and culture influence the effectiveness of nature experiences on well-being. This will allow customized nature pill prescriptions, as well as a deeper insight on how to design cities and well-being programs for the public.\" Source: Frontiers via ScienceDaily Journal Reference: MaryCarol R.

Frontiers in Psychology 10 (2019), DOI: 10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00722 Dose of nature is just what the doctor ordered June 24, 2016, BRISBANE, Australia\u2014People who visit parks for 30 minutes or more each week are much less likely to have high blood pressure or poor mental health than those who don't, according to new research by Australian and UK environmental scientists. A study led by The University of Queensland (UQ) and the ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions (CEED) suggests people might need a minimum \"dose of nature\". UQ CEED researcher Dr Danielle Shanahan said parks offered health benefits including reduced risks of developing heart disease, stress, anxiety and depression. \"If everyone visited their local parks for half an hour each week there would be seven per cent fewer cases of depression and nine percent fewer cases of high blood pressure,\" she said. \"Given that the societal costs of depression alone in Australia are estimated at $A12.6 billion a year, savings to public health budgets across all health outcomes could be immense,\" she said. UQ CEED researcher Associate Professor Richard Fuller said the research could transform the way people viewed urban parks. \"We've known for a long time that visiting parks is good for our health, but we are now beginning to establish exactly how much time we need to spend in parks to gain these benefits,\" he said. \"We have specific evidence that we need regular visits of at least half an hour to ensure we get these benefits.\" Dr Shanahan said 40 per cent of Brisbane residents did not visit an urban park in a typical week. \"So how can we encourage people to spend more time in green space?\" she said. \"We need more support and encouragement of community activities in natural spaces. \"For example, the Nature Play programs in Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia provide heaps of ideas for helping kids enjoy the great outdoors. \"Our children especially benefit from spending more time outdoors. Kids who grow up experiencing natural environments may benefit developmentally and have a heightened environmental awareness as adults than those who don't.\" The research is published in Nature Scientific Reports. The research team included scientists from UQ's School of Public Health, the University of Exeter, and CSIRO Land and Water. The Australian Government funds the Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions to inform evidence-based policy and sustainable management of the Australian environment. Nature walks may protect against mental illness June 29, 2015, STANFORD, CA\u2014Walking in nature appears to reduce the rumination associated with depression, according to a new study. American researchers compared the effect of talking a 90-minute walk through a natural environment or in an urban area. People in the first group reported lower levels of rumination, or repetitive negative thoughts, and reduced neural activity in the subgenual prefrontal cortex (sgPFC), a brain region linked to risk for mental illness. The researchers said more than 50 per cent of people now live in urban areas and levels of mental illness have increased alongside urbanization. They said their results \"suggest that accessible natural areas may be vital for mental health in our rapidly urbanizing world.\" The study, which appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America online ahead of print, was entitled \"Nature experience reduces rumination and subgenual prefrontal cortex activation.\" Tanya Hvilivitzky has spent more than 30 years in the communications field\u2014a career that has included stints as an investigative journalist, managing editor for a lifestyle & wellness magazine, corporate communications director, and researcher/writer.
