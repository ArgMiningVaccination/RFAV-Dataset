In recent years, however, we have been observing an increase in antimicrobially resistant infective agents in both human and veterinary medicine. This makes it increasingly difficult to successfully treat infections. DART , the German Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy, presents a concept for containing an-timi - crobial resistance. DART defines the targets and actions on which Germany will be concen-trating in its international and national efforts to combat antimicrobial resistance in the next five years. We will take systematic steps to counteract the principal causes of resistance development: the inappropriate use of antibiotics and inconsistent implementation of recommendations on the prevention of infections. In addition, we will be expanding surveillance systems for antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic consumption, intensifying prevention and control measures, promot - ing regional, national and international cooperation projects, and strengthening science and research in this field. DART is designed to contain antimicrobial resistance in Germany. We therefore request the co- operation of all the responsible players in this field in order to implement the strategy.

In Germany, more than 40,000 people died of the consequences of an infection in 2006, over 50 % of them of the consequences of pneumonia. Pneumonia was the seventh most frequent cause of death in Germany in 2006. The number of deaths caused by an infection rose by 14 % in Germany between the years 2002 and 2006. The number of deaths in which an infection is a contributory factor is even higher, since infectious diseases often occur as concomitant illnesses and are thus not recorded as the cause of death. The treatment of bacterial infectious diseases is becom - ing increasingly difficult as a result of the growing number of antimicrobially resistant pathogens. For the patients, this often means longer treatment periods, and also addi - tional stress resulting from the fact that the curing of an infection is either delayed or fails to materialise at all. Since the percentage of resistant pathogens has risen in recent years, and a further increase cannot be ruled out, a targeted approach is needed to reduce antimicrobial resistance and strengthen preventive measures at the local, regional and national level. The containment of antimicrobial resistance necessitates a comprehensive examination of the problem, since antimicrobial resistance occurs both in the field of human medicine and in veterinary medicine. Consequently, the present Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy was developed in collaboration with responsible stakeholders in the health sector, as well as in the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity. The German Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy, DART , contains meas - ures for detecting, preventing and controlling antimicro -1 Summary 1 Summary | 11 bial re-sistances in Germany. The central goal is to reduce the number and spread of antimicrobial resistances in Germany. 1.1 Human medicine The requirements were analysed, and the necessary measures for containing antimicrobial resistance deter - mined, by drawing up a systematic compilation and assessment of national activities and a comparison with international programmes for prevention and control of antimicrobial resistance. This served as the basis for elabo - rating the human-medicine segment of the strategy and for formulating its goals and actions. To achieve the central goal of reducing the number and spread of antimicrobial resistances, one particular aim is to work towards appropriate use of antibiotics and consis - tent application of infection hygiene. At the federal level, the key legal instruments for the sur - veillance of resistant pathogens, for infection-related hygiene and its monitoring, and for the prevention and control of infections caused by resistant pathogens, are defined in the Protection Against Infection Act (IfSG). The German States (\"L\u00e4nder\") have in some cases also issued supplementary regulations. Consis-tent implementation of the legal targets by the competent enforcement agen - cies, and by the responsible players in medical institu - tions, makes an essential contribution to achieving the central goal of the strategy. On the basis of, and expanding on, this set of legal instru - ments, the strategy formulates ten goals for reducing the number of spread of antimicrobial resistances. Actions and players are assigned to each goal, and a milestone is assigned to each action. A total of 42 actions are envis - aged, involving diverse, interconnected measures to be implemented in the period from 2008 to 2013. The ten goals can be assigned to the following four fields of action: I. Expanding surveillance systems for antimicrobial resis - tance and antibiotic consumption Surveillance systems for collecting and assessing data on antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic consumption are to be strengthened. An appropriate feedback system is to be used to pass back the analysed data to physicians who prescribe antibiotics. The expansion of an early-warning and response system is intended to guarantee early detection of pathogens displaying new resistances or resistance patterns, and of increasing regional/local accu - mulations or elevated incidences of certain resistant pathogens. Depending on the problem in question, tar - geted containment measures can then be initiated via the response system. II. Strengthening of prevention and control measures for reducing antimicrobial resistance T o promote efficient use of antibiotics, an Antibiotic Ther - apy Commission is to be set up at the Robert Koch Insti - tute (RKI). Among other things, it will be responsible for reviewing recommendations relating to antibiotic thera - py and initiating their elaboration. Moreover, measures are to be introduced for improving diagnostics, as well as the basic training, specialist training and continuing edu - cation of physicians and pharmacists, nursing staff and scientists in this field. III. Promoting cooperation If prevention and control measures for reducing antimi - crobial-resistant pathogens are also to be successful in the long term, the regional and national players in this sector need to cooperate. Based on previously estab - lished prevention and control strategies, regional net - works for preventing and controlling antimicrobial resist - ance are to be set up as pilot projects, and collabora-tion between regional players in this field is to be intensified. At the federal level, an Interministerial Working Group has been set up in the field of antimicrobial resistance to coor - dinate the actions on an interdepartmental basis and ensure a dialogue between affected players. In addi-tion, a Centre for the Prevention and Control of Antimicrobial Resistance is to be established at the RKI at the federal lev - el. At the specialist level, the Centre is to assume a coordi - nating role in the field of human medicine and safeguard Germany's cooperation with international specialist agencies. IV. Research and evaluation Inappropriate use of antibiotics can be the result of numerous factors. Consequently, studies are to be con - ducted with the aim of examining in detail the decisive factors in Germany and the tools or supporting measures that physicians would like to see in order to promote effi - cient antibiotic therapy. T o support research, the current situation is additionally to be analysed, and the possibilities for further strength - ening research are to be examined. 12 | 1 Summary 1.2 Veterinary medicine Infectious diseases are of similar importance in animal health as in the field of human medicine. In addition, infectious diseases in agricultural livestock cause serious economic losses. In the field of veterinary medicine, the occurrence and spread of resistances in bacteria patho - genic to humans and animals is to be reduced in the framework of the Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy. Responsible use of antibiotics is intended to ensure the protection of consumer health, but without impairing animal health. In particular, the following are to be achieved by the strat - egy for the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity: Comprehensive recording of the antimicrobial resist - ance situation, Continuous monitoring of the development of the antimicrobial resistance situation, Scientifically sound derivation of management meas - ures, Improved information of veterinary surgeons, farmers and consumers, Widespread acceptance and implementation of the management measures in veterinary medicine and ani - mal husbandry, Minimisation of antibiotic use, together with improved prophylaxis and hygiene to prevent infectious diseases, and An antimicrobial resistance situation that makes it possi - ble to preserve the efficacy of antibiotics in the future. The present Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy supports targeted measures for monitoring, controlling and avoid - ing antimicrobial resistance in Germany. Implementation of the goals it contains, and of the associated actions, necessitates the cooperation and support of the responsi - ble players in this sector. Only a joint strategy, supported and implemented by the affected groups, can efficiently contribute to containing the problem. 2 Principles of antimicrobial resistance 2.1 What is antimicrobial resistance? Antibiotics are substances used to treat bacterial infec - tions. Their action is characterised by selective toxicity, since they interact with bacterial target structures. Even small quantities are capable of inhibiting bacterial growth or killing the bacteria. If the antibiotic has no effect on the bacteria, this is referred to as antimicrobial resistance (or also antibiotic resistance), i.e. the antibiotic cannot be used for treatment. A distinction is made between natural and acquired antimicrobial resistance. In the case of natural resistance, there are no changes in the bacterial genotype. The antibiotic nevertheless has no effect because, for exam - ple, the size of the antibiotic molecule is such that it can - not pass through the bacterial cell wall and is thus unable to reach the site of action in the bacterium. Acquired resistance is based on changes in the bacterial genotype, which can arise due to what are known as mutations or through the acquisition of resistance genes. Resistance genes contain the genetic information of the antimicrobial resistance and are, for example, responsible for the formation of additional enzymes and efflux pumps that inactivate the antibiotic or transport it out of the bac - terial cell. 14 | 2 Principles of antimicrobial resistance In contrast to natural resistance, acquired resistance is highly variable and can in principle be transferred by transmission of the resistance genes to other bacteria. The exchange of resistance genes between different species of bacteria can lead to the development of mul - tiresistant pathogens. Hospitals are frequently critical locations, where these multiresistant pathogens occur in elevated numbers because different pathogens are pres - ent in high concentrations there and can undergo selec - tion as a result of the high level of antibiotic use. In addi - tion to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), in- creasing attention has in recent years been demanded by multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter. Serious infections resulting from resist - ance development in these and other, previously seldom observed pathogens, such as Clostridium difficile, fre - quently make treatment difficult. This also applies to patients in long-term care facilities. In addition, in-consis - tent decolonisation of MRSA patients in these facilities can lead to the development of reservoirs for multiresis - tant pathogens. Furthermore, pathogens having multiple resistances and elevated virulence are increasingly being observed in the general public, especially in connection with organisms causing pneumonia (Streptococcus pneu - moniae) and community-associated MRSA, and a pathogen causing urinary tract infec - tions. 2.2 Causes of resistance development Resistances develop, for example, as a result of the inter - play between resistance-mediating genetic events (mutation or absorption of \"resistance genes\") and selec - tion. Genetic events occur all the time, at a low rate. The selection pressure exerted by the use of antibiotics deter - mines whether they have an effect in terms of resistance development. One important cause of the increase in resistance devel - opment is the indiscriminate prescribing of antibiotics in human medicine. Antibiotics are often prescribed for viral infections (especially respiratory tract infections), although they are only effective against bacterial infec - tions. 58,66 In other words: antibiotics are frequently used without a confirmed Indication and without prior di- agnosis, partly because patients specifically ask for an antibiotic. 104 In addition, so-called broad-spectrum antibiotics are often used against bacterial infections for which narrow- spectrum antibiotics would be sufficiently effective. The widespread use of these antibiotics promotes selection, and thus also the spread of multiresistant pathogens. In the worst-case scenario, this can lead to broad-spectrum antibiotics no longer being effective because the bacteria have become resistant to the available antibiotics. Another reason for the constant increase in antimicrobial resistances in Germany is probably the incomplete knowl - edge of physicians and nursing staff regarding the antimi - crobial resistance problem. The subject is sometimes giv - en only very brief treatment in basic medical training, spe - cialist training and continuing education, which can result in antibiotics being used inappropriately and rec - ommendations on hygiene and infection prevention not being sufficiently observed. This can lead to resistance development and the spread of resistant pathogens in medical facilities, meaning that resistance rates can then rise very rapidly. Apart from incomplete knowledge of the antimicrobial resistance problem, there are numerous other influenc - ing factors and causes, such as fears of possible liability and compensation claims if antibiotic treatment is not given, or the patient's request for an antibiotic. As a result, antibiotics may be used inappropriately or excessively. 104 Moreover, knowledge of the antimicrobial resistance problem alone is not enough to change behavioural pat - terns and bring about the application of recommenda - tions and guidelines in this field. The unreliable intake of antibiotics by patients can like - wise encourage the development of antimicrobial resist - ances. Furthermore, antibiotic metabolites (breakdown prod - ucts) and resistant pathogens get into sewage via faeces. Some antibiotic metabolites can lead to the development of resistances in bacteria in sewers and sewage treatment plants, owing to the permanent selection pressure exist- ing there. In addition, antibiotics are discharged directly into the environment, where new resistances can then develop in open waters and in the soil. Consequently, there is a need to develop a joint strategy incorporating all the affected fields. 2 Principles of antimicrobial resistance | 15 2.3 What is the problem with antimicrobial resistance? Immediately after the first antimicrobial substances were introduced in the 1930s and 1940s, the first pathogens began to display resistance to them. As soon as the 1950s and 1960s, there was an increase in resistance to antibi - otics that had been in use since the late 1940s. As a result, broad-spectrum antibiotics are used, often unnecessarily, which again lead to selection of resistant pathogens and induce a further increase in the rate of resistant pathogens. Attention must be paid to the problem of cross-resistance and parallel resistance in this context. Due to the fact that gene segments responsible for sever - al resistances are located on certain genetic units, such as resistance plasmids, selection for one resistance simulta - neously encourages resistance to other antibiotics. At the same time, the ageing population and the growing use of invasive measures in modern medicine, e.g. sur - gery, will probably lead to a further rise in the demand for antibiotics. The resultant consequences for patients are possibly ineffective therapy, a longer duration of treat- ment, and curing of the infection that is delayed or possi - bly fails to materialise at all, sometimes with a fatal out - come. Moreover, substantial additional costs are incurred by the health system. The cost per infection caused by resistant pathogens can be more than twice as high as for infections caused by sensitive pathogens. These costs result from increasing medication costs, additional nurs - ing effort and a longer stay in hospital for the affected patients. 71,124 3 International situation in the field of antimicrobial resistance The rise in antimicrobial resistance in recent years is viewed with concern worldwide. Increasing resistance to antibiotics, particularly of pathogens responsible for res - piratory infections, has in the past few years led to grow - ing uncertainty among the public and also among physi - cians and the responsible players in the health system. As a reaction to this development, various organisations have launched initiatives and strategies for containing antimi - crobial resistance. In 2001, both the WHO and the European Commission published strategies for avoiding bacterial resistance to antibiotics. 12,128 Both strategies emphasise the importance of regional, national and international microbial surveil -lance strategies for control. Both the WHO and the EU ini - tiated the establishment of international resistance mon - itoring systems. Since 2001, the EU Member States have been sending resistance data to the EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System, see also Appendix 1.3.1). The EARSS resistance data show very low resistance rates in the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands in rela - tion to such pathogens aureus (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant Enterococ - ci. Southern European countries, such as Portugal and Greece, have the highest resistance rates for these pathogens and lead the field by far in a European com- 3 International situation in the field of antimicrobial resistance | 17 parison. The data from France reveal that MRSA rates there have been declining since introduction of the French strategy for safeguarding the effect of antibi - otics. 34 Germany comes in the middle of the field in a Euro - pean comparison. Some resistances, such as MRSA, rose steadily from 1999 to 2004, since when a constant resist - ance rate in the region of 20 % has been observed. In con - trast, the resistance rate for fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli has continued to rise, from 4 % in 1999 to 29 % in 2006. 38 The EU additionally initiated establishment of the Euro - pean ESAC network (European Surveillance of Antimicro - bial Consumption) to monitor the consumption of antibi - otics in the outpatient sector. These data show that Portugal and Greece have a high lev - el of antibiotic consumption, while the Netherlands have the lowest level of antibiotic use. 56 Germany has moderate to low antibiotic consumption in the outpatient sector in a European comparison. Compared to other European countries, however, reserve antibiotics (antibiotics with a very limited indication) and broad-spectrum antibiotics are prescribed more frequently in Germany. 112 These data reveal a correlation between the national use of antibiotics in the outpatient sector and the different national resistance rates in Europe. The differences in selection pressure, i.e. the different levels of antibiotic consumption, lead to different resistance rates in the indi - vidual countries. 67 The growing spread of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens makes it increasingly difficult to treat infections caused by (multi)resistant pathogens. 57 The lack of new antibiotics and diagnostic (rapid-test) methods for identifying (mul - ti)resistant pathogens is likewise leading to an increase in resistance rates. Rapid identification of resistant pathogens permits early, targeted action, and the indi - cated use of new antibiotics could contain resistant pathogens. The problem is that the pharmaceutical industry is increasingly withdrawing from research in this field, both internationally and in Germany. 36 The underlying reasons for this are the high development costs, which frequently take too long to recover since -compared to cardiovascu - lar drugs, for example -antibiotics have limited indica - tions and are only prescribed for a short period. Moreover, the development of antibiotics tends to be impeded by restriction of the indications for new antibiotics. This problem could be solved by strategic partnerships between scientific institutes and the pharmaceutical industry, 57 although greater commitment on the part of the pharmaceutical industry would be a fundamental pre - requisite in this context. Although many countries have higher antimicrobial resistance rates and higher antibiotic consumption than Germany, there are also countries, such as Denmark and the Netherlands, that are in a better position in a Euro - pean comparison. The success of the antimicrobial resist - ance policy of these countries shows that the situation in Germany can also be improved. The measures required for this purpose will be presented after a description of the German situation. 4 German situation in the field of anti - microbial resistance When considering all the existing measures and activities for recording and analysing data on antimicrobial resist - ance and on antibiotic consumption, as well as on the pre - vention and control of antimicrobial resistance in human medicine (presented in detail in 1.3), it can be seen that there are duplications and gaps in different sectors. Col - lected data are not pooled, or not fed back to prescribing physicians, and there is no top-level coordination of activ - ities. There now follows a more detailed description of the situation in the individual sectors. 4.1 Human medicine 4.1.1 Antimicrobial resistance data Data on antimicrobial resistance are available in various surveillance projects (see also Appendix 1.3.1). However, these data are hard to compare, and the majority of them are only available locally. The institutions leading the sur - veillance projects differ greatly as regards their levels of responsibility and action. In addition, the projects use dif - ferent diagnostic methods and assessment criteria, or they are not documented. Furthermore, some projects 4 German situation in the field of antimicrobial resistance | 19 provide no information regarding quality control, and thus on the quality of the data. Germany has no nationally uniform specifications regarding how data on antimicro - bial resistance should be recorded and analysed. The sur - veillance data available in Germany to date relate to indi - vidual species of pathogen, individual antibiotics and het - erogeneous patient populations. Urgently necessary for an early-warning system are data on the occurrence and spread of infections involving multi-resistant pathogens for which there are only limited therapy options, or none at all. The greater part of the data available in Germany describe the antimicrobial resistance situation in maximum-care hospitals. Only very limited data are available from the field of private practice and from hospitals providing basic and standard care. Consequently, no statements can be made as regards the antimicrobial resistance problem in these healthcare sectors. However, even the currently available data from maximum-care hospitals do not per - mit a representative, nationwide assessment of this sec - tor. The German Network for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (GENARS) provides good data on antimicro - bial resistance, compiled on the basis of excellent diag - nostics. However, only six university hospitals are current - ly involved in GENARS. Combined with the data collected for the EARSS network, these data cover a total of just 2 % of Germany's population. As a result, Germany, the coun - try with the highest population, takes last place among the total of 30 EARSS participants in terms of representa - tiveness. 69 A representative surveillance system for the outpatient and inpatient sectors is needed as a basis for localising problem areas in Germany, and also for comparing resist - ance rates at the national and international level. The situation in the outpatient and inpatient sectors dif - fers greatly. High antibiotic consumption in the inpatient sector leads to high selection pressure and can lead to high resistance rates in hospitals. The situation in the field of private practice is probably less serious. However, there has also been an increase in the number of resistant pathogens in the outpatient sector in recent years. An appropriate early-warning and response system for the outpatient and inpatient sectors is necessary in order to be able to monitor this trend and future developments. Knowledge of the changes occurring in resistance devel - opment in the outpatient and inpatient sectors is impor - tant, so that these changes can be taken into considera -tion in antibiotic therapy. Consequently, there is a need for a systematic procedure for feeding back antimicrobial resistance rates to the prescribing physicians. So far, this only exists to a very limited degree in Germany. 4.1.2 Antibiotic consumption data Analysed data on antibiotic consumption in hospitals are so far available only in isolated cases (see also Appendix 1.3.2), although most hospital dispensaries record data on antibiotic con-sumption. However, these data are record - ed with an eye to economic aspects, i.e. the costs of the prescribed antibiotics are compiled, not the quantities prescribed. It is estimated that antibiotics prescribed to inpatients account for a share of between 5 % and 20 % of all pre - scribed antibiotics. 36 Thus, the greater part (80 % to 95 %) is prescribed in the out-patient sector. Available data show that antibiotic consumption in the inpatient sector prima - rily depends on the clinical discipline and less on the size of the hospital. The highest antibiotic consumption is seen on intensive-care and haematological-oncological wards. 35,36 The SARI project (Surveillance of Antimicrobial Use and Antimicrobial Resistance in Intensive Care Units) was able to show that feeding back the consumption data to the prescribing physicians is capable of achieving a reduction of up to 30 % in antibiotic consumption in some cases. 87 The total antibiotic consumption of the partici - pating intensive-care wards showed no significant rise in the period 2001 to 2004, although there was an increase in the percentage of broad-spectrum antibiotics pre - scribed and in resistant pathogens. 91 The consumption data available for the inpatient sector are, however, not representative for Germany. 36 According to extrapolations by the Scientific Institute of the Local Health Care Funds (WIdO), roughly 250-300 tonnes of antibiotics were used in the outpatient sector of human medicine in 2004. 22 Outpatient antibiotic con - sumption in Germany has been stable since 1991, and declining slightly since 2001, although broad-spectrum antibiotics are accounting for an increasing share of total consumption. Regional antibiotic consumption differs within Germany. Almost twice as many antibiotics are pre - scribed in Western Germany (Rhineland-Palatinate) as in Eastern Germany (Brandenburg). 112,113 The reason for this is unknown. However, consumption could be reduced fur - ther for certain indications in the outpatient sector. Stud - ies reveal that antibiotics are prescribed to up to 80 % of patients with common colds, which are usually caused by 20 | 4 German situation in the field of antimicrobial resistance viruses. 58,66,95 However, it is also not always necessary to use antibiotics to treat bacterial infections, e.g. some diar - rhoeic illnesses. 95 The antibiotic consumption data compiled and analysed by the WIdO provide a very good description of consump - tion in the outpatient sector. They are representative for Germany and are prepared on the basis of the prescription accounts at the expense of all statutory health insurance funds. These data are available generally and compiled regular - ly. 94 Moreover, the data are also fed back to prescribing physicians in monthly prescription reports. 114 In addition, individual medical consulting can help physicians get an assessment of their own prescribing practices. 84 In this context, their own prescription data can be critically com - pared with the prescription data of other physicians in a reference region, or of a reference specialist group, thus leading to a reduction in the number of antibiotic pre - scriptions. The consumption data provide no information regarding the indication-oriented use of the antibiotics. Critical diagnosis and indication-oriented use would lead to a fur - ther reduction in antibiotic consumption. 113 4.1.3 Recommendations and guidelines for preventing and controlling antimicrobial resistance Numerous recommendations and guidelines exist in Ger - many regarding the control and avoidance of antimicro - bial resistance (see also Appendix 1.3.3), but certain resist - ance rates are nevertheless continuing to rise in Germany. Inconsistent application of the aforementioned recom- mendations and guidelines is part of the reason for this. For instance, actual compliance with guidelines for opti - mising antibiotic therapy on intensive-care wards reaches only 20 %-30 %. 117 Consequently, there is a need not only to introduce recommendations and guidelines, but also to comply with them and evaluate their application. T o make compliance easier for users, it is important to provide user-friendly standards that are readily accessible to everyone. Moreover, standards must be reviewed at regu - lar intervals, and also modified in keeping with the local resistance situation. To prevent unnecessary use of antibiotics, a diagnosis must be made critically and the necessity of antibiotic therapy determined. Recommendations and guidelines on diagnosing infectious diseases and on antibiotic thera - py can help promote the appropriate use of antibiotics in this context. However, recommendations and guidelines are developed and propagated by different interest groups. There is additionally the risk of economic interests influencing professional recommendations. Antibiotics are prescribed in almost all medical disci - plines. In the expert sector, there are many different groups that are in turn united in different scientific soci - eties. These scientific societies focus on a disease, a med - ical discipline, or also several medical disciplines. This makes it more difficult to jointly elaborate coordinated recommendations on the diagnosis and antibiotic thera - py of diseases. In Germany, uniform, independent and professionally sound recommendations and guidelines on the diagnosis of infectious diseases and on antibiotic therapy exist only for selected diseases, such as community-acquired pneu - monia (see Appendix 1.3.3.1 for an overview). 73 It is often known only in isolated cases whether such recommenda - tions are consulted as the basis for local recommenda - tions and (correctly) applied. Their application demon - strably has a positive effect on the course of therapy, its outcome and the curing or prevention of infections. 37,117 The antibiotic therapy recommended in local guidelines cannot always be applied owing to specific characteris - tics of the individual patient. Deviations may be neces - sary, particularly in the case of high-risk patients. In instances of this kind, advice from the local clinical micro - biologist can make a helpful and supportive contribution to antibiotic therapy. In addition, the hygiene and infection prevention recom - mendations of the Commission on Hospital Hygiene and Infectious Disease Prevention (KRINKO) are a significant help in controlling, avoiding and preventing the further spread of antimicrobial resistances; 108 the KRINKO infec - tion prevention recommendations include infections due to (multi)resistant pathogens. However, there is frequent - ly criticism that the recommendations are inadequately applied in practice. 126,127 The introduction of suitable meas - ures for increasing application of the recommendations is thus also important for reducing antimicrobial-resistant infective agents. A number of recommendations and guidelines also exist in connection with quality assurance in laboratory med - ical studies. 13 -15 Among other things, these guidelines are intended to ensure that the results of resistance tests or identifications of infective agents are comparable. The \"Chemotherapeutic Test Methods\" Working Committee 4 German situation in the field of antimicrobial resistance | 21 of the Medical Standards Committee of the German Institute for Standardization (DIN) addresses the stan - dardisation of methods for determining the susceptibility of infective agents. On the initiative of the DIN, a standard of the Inter-national Organization for Standardization (ISO 20776-1, 20776-2) has been elaborated and adopted that is now valid worldwide. 110 Nonetheless, different methods and assessments are still used for resistance test - ing, also in Germany, making it difficult to compare the data. 4,5,116,118 To counteract the unacceptable situation of there being different limits in Europe for interpreting resistance data, a Working Group of the European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) elaborated European limits (EUCAST), 50 which are in future to be in-corporated into the marketing authorisation process and into the expert information on antibiotics. 110 Uniform recommendations for resistance testing, and for the recording and assessment of data on antimicrobial resistance, are so far only available at the European level. 30 4.1.4 Basic training, specialist training and continuing education of medical occupational groups, pharmacists and natural scientists Knowledge deficits among physicians prescribing antibi - otics, and among nursing staff, as regards the antimicro - bial resistance problem can be one reason for the inappro - priate use of antibiotics and the spread of antimicrobial resistance. 2,32 A sound knowledge of the antimicrobial re- sistance problem is particularly important for physicians, pharmacists, nursing staff and natural scientists working in this field. Corresponding anchoring of the problem in basic training, specialist training and continuing educa - tion (see also Appendix 1.3.3.2) lays the foundations for ap- propriate use of antibiotics and for controlling and pre - venting the spread of (multi)resistant infective agents. Placing greater emphasis on this subject in the basic train - ing, specialist training and continuing education of the aforementioned occupational groups is an important supportive measure for reducing antimicrobial resistance in Germany. 4.1.5 Further supportive measures for preventing and controlling antimicrobial resistance At the European level, the Netherlands are a model exam - ple in the human medicine sector as regards their low antimicrobial resistance rates and antibiotic consump - tion. Dutch antimicrobial resistance policy is charac - terised by a consistent, coordinated approach based on the \"search and destroy\" principle. This approach is being analysed in the context of the Euregio project MRSA-net (see also Appendix 1.3.3.3). The MRSA-net is a regional net - work for protecting the population against MRSA infec - tions in the Twente/M\u00a7nsterland region. Initial results show that introduction of the measures in the framework of the MRSA-net was able to reduce the MRSA rate. In particular, the network structure promotes an ex change of knowledge and technology between partici - pating healthcare players, i.e. between physicians, nurs - ing staff, patients, their relatives and other involved parties. Knowledge deficits are eliminated, recommenda - tions and guidelines are revised on an application and target group-oriented basis, and their application within the MRSA-net is promoted. The resolution of the 79th Con - ference of Ministers Responsible for Health is also certain - ly to be welcomed in this spirit. It recommends the estab - lishment of regional networks involving all the players in the health sector for reducing MRSA infections and the spread of MRSA (see Appendix 1.3.3.3). However, the restriction of the networks to the MRSA problem should be regarded as a first step, and expansion to include fur - ther (multi)resistant pathogens targeted. 31,60 EU Member States are increasingly initiating public cam - paigns addressing the problem of anti-microbial resist - ance. Successful examples from France and Belgium show that they can make an important contribution to educat - ing the population. Patients' requests regarding the pre - scribing of antibiotics, and their correct intake, have an influence on antibiotic consumption. 104 Education cam - paigns could improve patients' knowledge in these areas and contribute to reducing antibiotic consumption. Hardly any public campaigns on this subject have been implemented for the general population in Germany (see also Appendix 1.3.3.4). There is so far also no knowledge regarding the degree of influence exerted on physicians by patients when antibiotics are prescribed, or of the extent to which antibiotics are taken inappropriately by patients in Germany. 4.1.6 Research 4.1.6.1 Research activities on antimicrobial resistance in the portfolio of the BMG The RKI conducts research in the field of antimicrobial resistance in various disciplines; studies and projects are implemented both by individual disciplines and jointly on an interdisciplinary basis, as well as with external partners in some cases. Six research areas of the RKI in the field of antimicrobial resistance are presented below. 22 | 4 German situation in the field of antimicrobial resistance I.Antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic consumption surveillance Surveillance is being reorganised under the designa - tion ARS (Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance in Ger - many) as the basis for research into the development of antimicrobial resistance and the emergence of new resistances. Clinically relevant bacterial pathogens are continuously documented in inpatient and outpa - tient healthcare according to a standard survey plan. It is in future also to be possible to make statements regarding structural features of patient care, the epi - demiological situation and the development of antimicrobial resistance over time. The investigation of specific questions in studies permits detailed analy - sis and the targeted introduction of preventive meas - ures. II.Studies of antibiotic prescribing and patients' attitu - des towards antibiotics A further area of research involves studies on the pre - scribing of antibiotics and patients' attitudes towards antibiotics. Promoting the appropriate use of antibiotics calls for knowledge of the factors influencing, and the reasons for, the prescribing of antibiotics by physicians in hos - pitals and in private practice. These factors influenc - ing the prescribing of antibiotics by physicians in Ger - many are to be examined in the framework of a study. Knowledge, attitudes and expectations of the public in relation to antibiotics and the prescribing of antibi - otics are being examined in a further study. III.Pathogens with special resistances Research in this area focuses on the molecular charac - terisation of pathogen strains, their resistance genes and their mobile genetic elements. In addition, stud - ies are carried out regarding the emergence and spread of strains displaying multiple resistance and new resistance characteristics. IV.Molecular biology, hygiene and epidemiological research into Clostridium difficile Both the distribution of Clostridium difficile in the hos - pital population and transmission routes in hospital are being investigated in the framework of a multi- centre study of C. difficile in hospitals in the Berlin/ Brandenburg region. Owing to high regional concentrations in Southwest Germany, epidemiological studies are being conduct - ed to examine temporal trends and risk factors in connection with severe courses of C. difficile infec - tions, as are molecular biology investigations regard - ing the occurrence and spread of fluoroquinolone- resistant hospital strains. V. Ecological studies on antimicrobial resistance Interdisciplinary ecological studies are implemented in the following areas: Horizontal resistance gene transfer, Spread of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonellae, Determination of the colonisation of veterinary sur - geons and veterinary staff with MRSA as a function of exposure. VI.Prevention of nosocomial infections The following scientific work is performed in this area: Survey of antibiotic use and elaboration of infection prevention concepts in homes for inactivating rele - vant pathogens causing nosocomial infections, Establishment of regional networks for intensifying prevention measures for avoiding the further spread of (multi)resistant pathogens, Together with the KRINKO, establishment of evi - dence-based prevention strategies for nosocomial infections. 4.1.6.2 Need for research and development The Joint Scientific Advisory Board (GWB) of the BMG addressed the need for research into antimicrobial resist - ance in the framework of a workshop at the RKI. This work - shop was attended by some 40 experts. Six working groups analysed deficits and fields of action in the sphere of antimicrobial resistance research. A joint final discus - sion defined the following deficits to be eliminated with priority in the individual areas: 1.Social science and public health studies Survey of the population regarding antibiotic use, interaction with physicians, intake patterns, atti - tudes towards antibiotics Analysis of existing data (e.g. KIGGS, routine pharma - coepidemiological data, individual patient data) on antibiotic use in different social strata, assessment of the quality of antibiotic prescribing Behavioural psychology research for improving hygiene-related behaviour in hospitals/ prevention of the transmission of antimicrobial resistances Evaluation of continuing education methods for physicians regarding the prescribing of antibiotics 4 German situation in the field of antimicrobial resistance | 23 2.Healthcare-oriented research Optimisation of surveillance, particularly in the out - patient sector Outcome-oriented intervention studies (antibiotic use, hygiene measures) Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD network) T ransmission studies, persistence studies 3.Molecular epidemiology Implementation of the results of genomics for pathogen typing and characterisation Development and establishment of methodological platforms and central databases, including bioinfor - matics Clarification of population structures (composition and dynamics of infective agents in relation to the development of antimicrobial resistance Studies on the importance of antibiotic use for the microecology of bacterial populations in colonisa - tion habitats (intestinal flora, cutaneous flora) Studies on the macroecology of antimicrobial resist - ance (timely detection of the emergence of \"new resistances\") 4.Clinical microbiology Determination of risk factors (morbidity, physician- related factors) for regionally high out-patient antibiotic consumption Determination of protective factors (structural, process-related factors in the field of hygiene and in the field of antibiotic management, case mix) for low rates of nosocomial infection by resistant pathogens and of defined complications of infec - tions Development and validation of controllable indica - tors (including microbiological diagnostics) for appropriate antibiotic use Development and clinical validation of rapid tests (confirmation of pathogen and/or resistance, bio - markers) 5.Molecular foundations of antimicrobial resistance Adaptation mechanisms of bacteria (resistoge - nomics and pathogenomics), evolutionary aspects of resistance and transfer, rapid diagnosis of resist - ances Development of antibiotics that impede resistance development In vivo studies of virulence and growth mechanisms, and of interaction with the human immune system Systemic biology analysis of resistance 6.Development of vaccines against multiresistant pathogens Development of passive and active vaccines against S. aureus and other multiresistant nosocomial pathogens Development of effective vaccines for immune- compromised and elderly patients Development of new vaccination strategies to improve mucosal protection Development of informative animal models and sur - rogate markers 4.1.7 Necessity of a national, interdisciplinary strategy The development of antimicrobial resistance is a complex process and influenced by numerous factors. Given rising resistance rates in Germany, there is an urgent need for action. Monitoring, controlling and minimising antimi - crobial resistances requires a coordinated strategy that initially focuses on interventions in certain areas. The example of France clearly shows that the introduction of a coordinated national strategy is capable of successfully reducing antibiotic consumption and antimicrobial resistance rates. 68 Particularly the extensive education and information of the public, and of physicians in private practice, in France has so far led to a 13.3 % decline in the prescribing of antibiotics since the French strategy was introduced. 36 The European Commission also demands the develop - ment of a national strategy. In its Recommendation on the prudent use of antimicrobial agents in human medicine, the EU calls upon the Member States to introduce specific strategies for the prudent use of antimicrobial agents in order to contain antimicrobial resistance. 27 Therefore, a national strategy has been developed for detecting, preventing and controlling antimicrobial resistances. It is designed to permit top-level coordina - tion, evaluation and expansion of activities, and to guar - antee a coordinated approach when tackling existing and/or new problems in the field of antimicrobial resist - ance. To ensure that the strategy covers every essential aspect, relevant players were called upon to take active part in devising the strategy. 24 | 4 German situation in the field of antimicrobial resistance 4.2 Veterinary medicine 4.2.1 Importance of antimicrobial resistance for the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity Antimicrobial resistance is a significant problem for public health and thus also has an impact on the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity. Antibi - otics are, however, indispensable for treating sick animals and animal stocks. Occupation with the subject of anti- microbial resistance consequently has an impact on con - sumer protection, animal protection and animal health as aims of the BMELV. Every use of antibiotics in human medi - cine, veterinary medicine or plant protection can lead to the development of resistances. Moreover, substances that have antibiotic action, but are used with a different objective in mind (e.g. certain mycotics or coccidiostats and histomonostats), can likewise lead to the develop - ment of resistances due to their influence on the omnipresent bacterial flora. On the one hand, the resistances occurring in veterinary medicine have direct effects on animal health in that they can negatively impact the efficacy of veterinary medicinal products (antibiotics). This gives rise to direct conse - quences for the treatment both of agricultural livestock and of \"hobby\" animals (e.g. pets and small animals) that need to be considered in veterinary medicine and can lead to problems when treating infectious diseases. The consequence can be restricted availability of effective antibiotics for veterinary medicine, and thus deficits in animal protection. On the other hand, the emergence of antimicrobial-resist - ant pathogens in animals is also of direct significance for man and human health. The possibility of transmission of bacteria (pathogens and commensal organisms) display - ing antimicrobial resistances to persons working in animal husbandry (e.g. farming) or to animal owners (e.g. \"hob - by\" animals, animals as members of the family, pets and small animals) cannot be ruled out. Moreover, transmis - sion to humans through foods of animal origin is also pos - sible, if they are contaminated with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics or bear antimicrobial resistance determinants. Similarly, the pathogens excreted by animals are released into the environment. There are signs that the existing pool of resistance genes grows in the environment, and that the passing-on of resistance genes is promoted in this way. 4.2.2 Aims of the Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy for the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veteri- nary activity The Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy for the field of ani - mal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity is intended, in a cooperative effort of human medicine and veterinary medicine, to influence the use of antibiotics in animals and reduce the emergence and spread of resist - ances in bacteria that colonise humans or animals. The aim is that the strategy be acknowledged and put into practice by veterinary surgeons, farmers, animal owners, industrial associations and competent authorities. This strategy, and the handling of antibiotics in animal hus - bandry, reflect pan-European and international/suprana - tional targets. In conjunction with existing antibiotics guidelines - which are currently being revised - responsi - ble use of antibiotics in the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity is intended to ensure the protection of consumer health without impairing ani - mal health. To this end, there is also a need for research and development work as regards improved animal hus - bandry, diagnosis and alternatives to the use of antibi - otics. The strategy is designed to achieve the following targets: Comprehensive documentation of the antimicrobial resistance situation, Constant monitoring of the development of the antimi - crobial resistance situation, Scientifically sound derivation of management meas - ures, Improved information of veterinary surgeons, farmers and consumers, Widespread acceptance and implementation of the management measures in veterinary medicine and ani - mal husbandry, A reduction in antibiotic use, together with improved prophylaxis and hygiene to prevent infectious diseases, and An antimicrobial resistance situation that also makes it possible to preserve the efficacy of antibiotics in the future. To achieve these targets, the measures already in exis - tence are analysed and the need for action is described. In addition, research and development needs are derived. The strategy for achieving the targets listed must be seen as a dynamic process. To be able to verify the efficacy of the measures taken and to be taken, regular reports are to be submitted regarding the progress of the measures described. An open discussion with all affected groups is 4 German situation in the field of antimicrobial resistance | 25 to be held to this end. It may be necessary in future to specify new measures or amend the measures taken. 4.3 Environment After use, antibiotics can get into the environment by a wide variety of routes, by far the greater part being dis - charged via sewage treatment plants. Also of significance in this respect is the discharge of resistant pathogens in the sewage from hospitals, for example. The possibility of this sewage having an undesirable effect on water and soil organisms cannot be ruled out. Antibiotics and resistant pathogens have already been detected in the discharge from sewage treatment plants and in surface waters. 115,119 However, antibiotics and resistant infective agents can also be released directly into the environment, e.g. from animal husbandry. Antibiotics are not readily biodegrad - able. This encourages resistance development resulting from increased discharge into the environment, and also the risk of resistant pathogens in the environment con - tributing to the problem of resistance development in infective agents. 15 DART in the field of human medicine 5.1 Principal goal of the strategy The German Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy, DART , is intended to make a decisive contribution to reducing the number and spread of antimicrobial resistances in Ger - many. To achieve this goal, all the players involved are actively participating in the realisation of the national goals and cooperating closely with each other. 5.2 National goals The national goals set forth the strategic orientation of the German Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy and define its key content. The goals are the basis for developing, maintaining or improving activities at the national, regional and local level, and for specifying fields of action, ac-tions and milestones. All in all, the present strategy encompasses ten national goals, which are in turn grouped in four components: 5 DART in the field of human medicine | 27 I.Surveillance systems for antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic consumption II.Prevention and control measures for reducing antimi- crobial resistances III.Cooperation and coordination IV.Research and evaluation In structural terms, this strategy design and the order of the national goals are geared to the recommendations of the European Council. Therefore, the design and the order of the goals do not permit any statement to be made regarding the importance of the individual goals. Actions and players are assigned to each goal, and a mile - stone is assigned to each action (an overview of the actions and milestones can be found in the Appendix). The actions are to begin or be completed by the respective milestones in order to achieve the goals. COMPONENT I: Surveillance systems for antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic consumption GOAL 1 Strengthening of the surveillance systems for antimicro - bial resistance and antibiotic consumption Sub-goal 1.1: Strengthening of the surveillance systems for recording and assessing antimicrobial resis - tance Requirement: Representative surveillance system for the outpatient and inpatient sectors for assessing local, regional and national antimicrobial resistance in Germany, with cen - tral recording and analysis of the data. Background: At the local level, the surveillance of data on antimicrobial resistance from daily routine diagnosis permits assess - ment of the problem in local medical facilities, particular - ly by means of comparison with regional or national data. Surveillance reveals problems, making it easier to tackle and remedy or improve them in a (more) targeted man - ner. In addition, data on antimicrobial resistance provide information of importance for assessing the effectiveness of intervention measures introduced. The effect of an intervention measure can be examined by comparing the resistance rates before and after the intervention. Moreover, knowledge of the local resistance situation reduces the risk of therapy failures, and the quality of patient treatment improves. The national collection and presentation of local data on antimicrobial resistance permits central analysis of the data. These data are also to be accessible and usable for the scientific community. National data are important for producing national trend analyses and for international comparison. Pooling local data from routine diagnosis indicates whether resistance problems are locally defined or have supraregional dimensions. This makes it possible to react promptly to new and existing resistance prob - lems. Actions: Compilation of acknowledged recommendations for the recording and analysis of data on antimicrobial resistance Milestone : By the end of 2009, under the management of the RKI Integration of existing surveillance projects with a gen - eral survey approach and based on existing structures, as well as establishment of a central database; recruit - ment of new participants, long-term support and main - tenance of the database on surveillance of antimicro - bial resistances Milestone : Starting in 2008, at the RKI Review of data on antimicrobial resistance from exist - ing surveillance projects with a specific survey approach as regards quality and comparability, and pooling of the data from these projects in annual reports Milestone : By the end of 2009, under the management of the RKI Joint use of the antimicrobial resistance database by RKI/BfArM, and availability of the data to the scientific community Milestone : Starting in 2010, RKI and BfArM Expansion of compulsory notification according to Sec - tion 7 Para. 1, first sentence, IfSG to include the detec - tion of MRSA in blood or liquor and the detection of tox - in A or B of Clostridium difficile in tient practices, relevant research facilities, e.g. CAP-Netz coordinators 28 | 5 DART in the field of human medicine Sub-goal 1.2: Strengthening of the monitoring systems for recording and assessing antibiotic consumption Requirement: Representative monitoring system for the outpatient and inpatient sectors for assessing local and national antibiot - ic consumption for Germany, with central recording and analysis of the data Background: The monitoring of antibiotic consumption data permits comparison of the antibiotics prescribed in a region, on the national average, or in certain disciplines or on certain wards. This permits correlation of consumption and resist - ance data, and signs of possibly excessive or incorrectly indicated antibiotic use can be discovered, checked and, if appropriate, remedied. Local antibiotic consumption data provide information on the quantitative prescribing practices of medical spe - cialists or physicians in a region. In addition, correlation of local antibiotic consumption data with the local resist - ance situation permits qualitative statements regarding the prescribing practices of these groups. A rough assess - ment of the antimicrobial resistance problem can also often be made on the basis of antibiotic consumption. Local antibiotic consumption data are also necessary for assessing the effectiveness of an intervention measure (e.g. training/continuing education or participation in a quality circle). They additionally offer sound arguments for decisions and recommendations. The pooling of local antibiotic consumption data to obtain national data permits comparison within the vari - ous regions, specialist groups and different institutions in Germany, and also at the international level. Actions: Compilation of acknowledged recommendations for the recording and analysis of data on antibiotic con - sumption Milestone : By the end of 2009, under the management of the RKI in cooperation with the Freiburg Centre for Infectious Diseases and the National Reference Centre for Surveillance of Nosocomial Infections Review of data on antibiotic consumption from other monitoring projects (e.g. SARI and MABUSE) as regards quality and comparability, and pooling of the data from these projects in annual reports Milestone : By the end of 2010, under the management of the RKI in cooperation with the Freiburg Centre for Infectious Diseases and the National Reference Centre for Surveillance of Nosocomial Infections Recruitment of new participants, and long-term sup - port and maintenance of the database on monitoring of antibiotic consumption Milestone : Starting in 2009, at the RKI Introduction of voluntary antibiotic consumption mon - itoring in hospitals Milestone : By the end of 2009, under the management of the BMG Participants: Centre for Infectious Diseases and the National Reference Centre for Surveillance of Nosocomial Infections GOAL 2 Systematic feedback of data on antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic consumption Sub-goal 2.1: Establishment of a feedback system Requirement: Systematic feedback of data on antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic consumption to physicians prescribing antibiotics Background: Data collected in the surveillance systems for antimicro - bial resistance (Sub-goal 1.1) and antibiotic consumption (Sub-goal 1.2) must be passed on to the prescribing physi - cian. Only if physicians have an overview of their prescrib - ing practices and the local resistance problem can they give appropriate consideration to them when prescribing in future. Feeding back resistance and consumption data to physi - cians prescribing antibiotics is capable of reducing antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic consumption, thereby achieving savings. Actions: Survey of the participants in the antimicrobial resist - ance surveillance system and establishment of a feed - back system Milestone : By the end of 2009, at the RKI Participants : BMG, RKI, BfArM, microbiological centres/ laboratories, out - patient practices, rehabilitation facilities and nursing homes, DKG, SHI, PKV, G-BA, IQWiG, KBV, B\u00c4K, of Physicians, Regional Associations of SHI-Accredit - ed Physicians 5 DART in the field of human medicine | 29 Sub-goal 2.2: Expansion of the system of National Refe - rence Centres Requirement: Needs-based completion of the system of National Refer - ence Centres Background : Timely detection of the emergence and spread of multire - sistant pathogens, of new types of re-sistance (resistance genes and resistance mechanisms) and of outbreaks requires not only surveillance of antimicrobial resistance data from routine diagnosis, but often also further diag - nostic and/or molecular epidemiological studies. Studies of this kind are part of the sphere of responsibility of the National Reference Centres. Among other tasks, National Reference Centres are commissioned with promptly establishing sensitive and complex, new molec - ular biological systems for diagnosing new pathogen vari - ants, and with assuring the quality of these diagnostic methods. In this way, new pathogen variants can be detected promptly, and prevention measures intro - duced. This requires feedback of the study results and, where appropriate, the test methods used to the microbi - ological laboratories. In Germany, National Reference Centres exist only for selected pathogens, meaning that advanced studies are so far only ensured for these pathogens. Existing deficits, e.g. regarding infections with enterobacteria or Clostridi - um difficile, are currently dealt with on a project basis for a limited time and with limited capacities. Further gaps, and the material and personnel requirements to be derived from them, need to be identified. Working on this basis, an institution is to be identified for implementing advanced studies. This is to be followed by expansion of the work capacities for advanced studies, so that these studies can be performed in accordance with require - ments and at an internationally competitive level. Actions: Identification of the work capacity for advanced diag - nostics/studies of (multi)resistant pathogens for which no National Reference Centre currently exists Milestone : By the end of 2009, under the management of the BMG Identification and appointment of an institution cater - ing to the requirements for advanced diagnostics/stud - ies of (multi)resistant pathogens Milestone : By the end of 2009, under the management of the BMG Participants: BMG, RKI, NRZ, consultant laboratories, Infection Epidemiology Commission, scientific societies Sub-goal 2.3: Establishment of an early-warning system Requirement: Early-warning system for (new) resistance problems Background: Strengthening the existing surveillance system for recording antimicrobial resistances at the RKI (see also Sub-goal 1.1) will, together with the expansion of advanced diagnostics for multiresistant pathogens (Sub- goal 2.2), enable timely detection of new pathogens and resistances in the outpatient and inpatient sectors. The information gained is to be used for prompt elaboration of therapy and hygiene recommendations and for the development of prevention strategies. Adapted to the respective resistance problem, they are to be prepared by the RKI in the frame-work of its statutory tasks and made available to the competent authorities and agencies, as well as the affected specialist circles, so that the necessary measures can be taken there. Actions: Establishment of an early-warning system Milestone : By the end of 2010, under the management of the RKI Participants: BMG, RKI, L\u00e4nder authorities, \u00d6GD, NRZ, consultant labo - ratories, Infection Epidemiology Commission, scientific societies Sub-goal 2.4: Introduction of quality indicators in the field of antimicrobial resistance Requirement: Cross-sectoral introduction and application of quality indicators for antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance Background: The introduction and application of quality indicators in the field of the antibiotics problem can contribute to qual - ity assurance, and thus also to controlling antimicrobial resistances. According to Section 91 of Book V of the German Social Security Code (SGB V), external quality assurance, meas - ures for improving quality, and patient information is part of the sphere of responsibility of the Federal Joint Com -30 | 5 DART in the field of human medicine mittee (G-BA). According to Section 137 Para. 1, first sen - tence, No. 1, the G-BA is authorised to define obligatory measures for quality assurance ac -cording to Section 135a and the fundamental requirements for institution-inter - nal quality man-agement. In cooperation with the institu - tion according to Section 137a (BQS successor organi- sation), \"cross-sectorally coordinated indicators and instruments\" are to be developed that permit the \"mea - surement and presentation\" of the quality of services in all healthcare sectors. The G-BA furthermore defines the content of the Quality Report to be published at intervals of two years (Section 137 Para. 3, first sentence, No. 4). According to Para. 2, the guidelines according to Section 137 that the G-BA issues are to be of a cross-sectoral nature. Actions: Development of indicators for antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance Milestone : Starting in 2009 Examination of integration of the indicators in the external quality assurance of the institution according to Section 137a and in the Quality Report according to Section 137, Para. 3, first sentence, No. 4 Milestone : Starting in 2009 Introduction and application of quality indicators, e.g. in the framework of the AQIUK project (Outpatient Quality Indicators and Indices) of the KBV Milestone : Starting in 2009 Participants: G-BA, \u00c4ZQ, German Coalition for Patient Safety, BMG, RKI, scientific societies COMPONENT II: Prevention and control measures for reducing antimicro - bial resistances GOAL 3 Promotion of the application of guidelines Sub-goal 3.1: Development of guidelines Requirement: Generally acknowledged guidelines and recommenda - tions for antibiotic therapy Background: International studies show that up to 50 % of all courses of antibiotic therapy given are inadequate, e.g. due to unsuitable doses or treatment periods. 32,103 Recommenda - tions and guidelines help medical staff when selecting and dosing an antibiotic and diagnosing infectious dis -eases. The quality of healthcare services and treatment can be improved by recommendations and guidelines, thereby increasing patient safety. Hardly any studies on the (correct) application of recom - mendations and guidelines for antibiotic therapy have been carried out in Germany to date. 117 The application of recommendations and guidelines, and their value, are improved if the recommendations are evidence-based, coordinated with scientific societies/groups and adapted to local conditions. Local recommendations are to be based on national, pro - fessionally sound recommendations and guidelines for antibiotic therapy. The review of existing recommenda - tions and guidelines for antibiotic therapy, and initiation of the preparation of necessary new ones, is in future to be handled by an expert committee at the RKI. T o this end, an Antibiotic Therapy Commission is to be set up, similar to the commissions already existing at the RKI. This Commis - sion is also to be responsible for preparing general princi - ples for antibiotic therapy, formulating a professional as- sessment of the antimicrobial resistance problem and advising the Interministerial Working Group on Antimi - crobial Resistance. The nationally uniform guidelines are to serve as a basis for preparing local recommendations. Local recommen - dations are necessary on the basis of the local resistance situation. At the local level, the heads of medical institutions are to be responsible for the preparation of internal or local guidelines for antibiotic therapy. The relevant medical disciplines and players in the hospital are to be involved in preparing the guidelines, also giving consideration to the local antimicrobial resistance situation. This is intended to encourage application of the recommendations and guidelines. T aking the outpatient situation into account, comparable recommendations are also to be drawn up for the outpatient sector. Easy access to the national and local recommendations and guidelines is of decisive importance for their applica - tion. Compliance with the recommendations and guide - lines is to be supported by constant updating and adapta - tion. It is additionally to be examined whether and to what extent the introduction of quality indicators can support the preparation, introduction and application of local guidelines in hospitals. Actions: Establishment of an Antibiotic Therapy Commission at the RKI 5 DART in the field of human medicine | 31 Milestone : By mid-2009, under the management of the BMG Preparation of general principles for antibiotic therapy, compilation of nationally acknowledged recommen - dations and guidelines, initiation of the preparation of necessary guidelines Milestone : Starting in 2010, by the Antibiotic Therapy Commission at the RKI Evaluation of the application of recommendations for antibiotic therapy Milestone : Starting in 2013, under the management of the RKI Participants: BMG, RKI, BfArM, Antibiotic Therapy Commission, scientif - ic societies, German Medical Association, State Chambers of Physicians, SHI, PKV, G-BA, IQWiG, KBV, Regional Associ - ations of SHI-Accredited Physicians, \u00d6GD, hospitals, out - patient practices, rehabilitation facilities and nursing homes, AKd\u00c4, KRINKO, \u00c4ZQ Sub-goal 3.2: Promotion of structures for applying guide - lines and recommendations Requirement: Strengthening of structures for improving cooperation between responsible organisational units in hospitals Background: According to Section 135a in conjunction with Section 137 SGB V, hospitals are obliged to operate an internal quality management system and must implement the regula - tions of the Protection Against Infection Act. Hygiene and Drug Commissions are suitable instruments for this pur - pose, although they do not yet exist in all hospitals. These Commissions often practice the division of labour, in that the Hygiene Commission particularly deals with epidemi - ological issues, while the Drug Commission is responsible for structuring drug therapy. A dialogue between the two Commissions should be ensured to achieve optimum prevention and control of antimicrobial resistances. Cooperation of this kind can, for example, be realised in the framework of an Infection Management Commission: this commission could moni - tor implementation of the Protection Against Infection Act and the KRINKO recommendations, further develop hygiene regulations, locally implement guidelines for antibiotic therapy and provide advice on the use of antibi - otics. T o ensure prompt action if resistances emerge local - ly, the Infection Management Commission could form a Rapid-Response Team, both to serve as a contact point and also to analyse the situation and coordinate the pre -vention measures in the event of resistances emerging (see also Fig. 1). Fig. 1: Possible structure for improving cooperation between organisational units in hospitals Actions: Examination of the possibilities for improving coopera - tion between responsible organisational units in Milestone: Starting in 2009 Infection Protection Working Group, \u00d6GD, institution according to Section 137a, hospitals, \u00c4ZQ, KRINKO, German Coalition for Patient Safety, BMG, RKI, scientific societies, KBV GOAL 4 Safeguarding diagnosis Requirement: Improvement of the diagnosis of bacterial infective agents and their antimicrobial resistance in terms of scope, quality and speed Background: Pathogen diagnosis that is appropriate to the indication, and also comprehensively includes antimicrobial resist - ance, makes a major contribution to quality assurance when treating bacterial infections. The application of diagnostic procedures, together with the clinical picture presented by the patients, makes it possible to distinguish between viral and bacterial infections, and also to deter - mine the necessary duration of antibiotic therapy. 65 This can achieve up to 50 % savings on antibiotic prescriptions. 24 Additional costs can also be prevented by rapid identifica - tion of (multi)resistant infective agents and efficient Hospital hygiene Microbiology Hospital Hygiene Commission Drug Commission Infection Management Commission Rapid Response Team 32 | 5 DART in the field of human medicine (admission) screening of high-risk patients. 124,125 There is furthermore a need to improve the hospital-wide man - agement and sanitation of patients with multiresistant pathogens in both the inpatient and the outpatient sec - tor. Test systems for rapid diagnosis can make a supportive contribution in this context, since they allow pathogen diagnosis in a matter of hours. Rapid identification of mul - tiresistant pathogens prevents the further spread of (mul - ti)resistant infective agents, thus promoting targeted antibiotic therapy and the use of narrow-spectrum antibi - otics. General MRSA diagnosis and the decolonisation of MRSA patients are included in the services provided by statutory health insurance. They are taken into account in the framework of the remuneration of SHI-accredited physi - cians. Beyond this, the SHI system makes no provision for separate remuneration for the use of rapid-diagnosis test systems. General screening of high-risk patients is not included in the services provided by statutory health insurance and is thus not eligible for reimbursement in the framework of SHI. 59,65 The quality of diagnosis is increasingly the subject of criti - cism. Actions: Review of the eligibility for reimbursement of diagnos - tic procedures and possible obstacles to their applica - tion, as well as identification of deficits and problems in connection with quality assurance in diagnosis Milestone : Starting in 2009, under the management of the BMG Review of the importance of, and preparation of, rec - ommendations for the use of (rapid-test) diagnosis in private practices and hospitals Milestone : 2009-2010, under the management of scien - tific societies and experts Participants: BMG, RKI, G-BA, SHI, PKV, Regional Associations of SHI- Accredited Physicians, National Association of SHI- Accredited Physicians, IQWiG, committee for rating office-based doctors' services, pharmaceutical industry, \u00d6GD, hospitals, outpatient practices, rehabilitation facili - ties and nursing homes, DGHM, B\u00c4MI, veterinary medi - cine, VDGH GOAL 5 Promotion of the basic training, specialist training and continuing education of medical occupational groups, pharmacists and natural scientists Requirement: Greater emphasis on the subject of antimicrobial resist - ance in the basic training, specialist training and continu - ing education of physicians, pharmacists, nursing staff and natural scientists Background: Physicians, pharmacists, nursing staff and natural scien - tists who have knowledge deficits as regards diagnosis, or fail to apply existing knowledge, efficient antibiotic thera - py and the avoidance of infections due to resistant infec - tive agents, are also a cause of increasing antimicrobial resistance rates. The adequate communication of knowledge regarding the antimicrobial resistance problem in the context of basic training, specialist training and continuing educa - tion, and application of this knowledge, must be ensured, especially among physicians prescribing antibiotics, but also among pharmacists and hospital nursing staff. Firmly establishing this topic in the basic training, specialist training and continuing education of these occupational groups lays the foundations for appropriate use of antibi - otics and appropriate handling of (multi)resistant infec - tive agents. Implementation of the acquired knowledge in practice will contribute to reducing antimicrobial resistance. The communication between physician and patient also plays an important role in connection with the prescrib - ing of antibiotics. The physician's perception of a patient's wishes has an influence on the prescribing of an antibiot - ic. However, physicians often do not perceive a patient's wishes correctly. Talking about the patient's needs and the necessity of an antibiotic could counteract the inap - propriate prescribing of antibiotics. A supportive contri - bution in this context can be made by checklists that serve as a basis for discussions between the physician or phar - macist and the patient. Actions: Elaboration of proposals for increasing emphasis on the topics of antimicrobial resistance and patient commu - nication in the basic training, specialist training and continuing education of physicians, pharmacists and nursing staff Milestone : By mid-2009, under the management of the BMG 5 DART in the field of human medicine | 33 Review of the possibilities for more firmly establishing the subject of antimicrobial resistance in natural sci - ence study courses, especially in the study of biology Milestone : by the end of 2009, under the management of scientific societies, professional associations Establishment of a certified continuing education pro - gramme for qualification as NIP/ABS Officer (NIP = Nosocomial Infection Prevention, ABS = Antibiotic Stewardship) Milestone : Initiation in 2009, by DGI and DGHM Participants: DGHM, DGI, BMG, BZgA, German Medical German Dental Association, State Chambers of Physi - cians, State Dental Chambers, Brandenburg State Cham - ber of Physicians, ABDA, scientific societies, professional associations, universities, patient associations, German Nursing Council COMPONENT III: Cooperation and coordination GOAL 6 National cooperation Promoting the sustainability of actions and structures in the field of antimicrobial resistance requires content- related and structural cooperation between the Federal Government, the L\u00e4nder and both public and private play - ers in this field. With the present strategy, an exchange between the players is initiated by the BMG. The recom - mended structural cooperation and networking of play - ers at the national, L\u00e4nder and local level is described in the sub-goals below. Sub-goal 6.1: Cooperation at the regional level Requirement: Strengthening of regional cooperation between players in the healthcare sector Background: For prevention and control measures for reducing antimi - crobial resistances to be successful in the long term, there must be cooperation between the players in the health - care sector. In this context, cooperation in the various sec - tors of healthcare should also include cross-sectoral quali - ty assurance pursuant to Section 137 Paras. 1 and 2 and Sec - tion 137a SGB V. It has become apparent that the restric - tion of prevention measures to hospitals alone is insuffi - cient.60 For example, an MRSA patient must receive con - sistent aftercare from the physician in private practice or the nursing home after being discharged from hospital. In addition, the physician in private practice or the nursing home, and also the patient and his or her relatives, must know what measures are important in the event of infec - tion with a (multi)resistant pathogen. This requires educa - tion and training of the staff and/or the relatives. The establishment of regional networks for prevention and control of MRSA is also recom-mended at the L\u00e4nder level (Resolution of the 79th Conference of Ministers Responsible for Health) for containing the growing MRSA problem. Many of the problems existing as regards the prevention and control of MRSA also occur in connection with other (multi)resistant infective agents. Therefore, the networks recommended by the Conference of Ministers Responsi - ble for Health should not restrict themselves to the MRSA problem. Regional networks for prevention and control of antimi - crobial resistances could be used for discussions, training and continuing education, but also for advising the partic - ipating players in the health sector, as well as patients and their relatives. Interactive meetings offering continuing education, where individual problems and prescribing practices, or local/regional antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic consumption data, are dis-cussed and analysed, promote appropriate antibiotic use by the participating physi - cians. 2,32 For this reason, regional networks for the preven - tion and control of antimicrobial resistances are to be established, based on the model of the MRSA-net EUREGIO project. The public health service (\u00d6GD) serves to protect the health of the population and is in permanent contact with all stakeholders in healthcare provision at the regional lev - el. Consequently, the \u00d6GD should be responsible for the establishment of these regional networks, for the sustain - ability of the network structure, and also for moderation of the networks. Actions: Pilot projects for creating regional networks for pre - vention and control of antimicrobial resistances in selected areas Milestone : By the end of 2009, under the management of the L\u00e4nder (Infection Protection Working Group) and the \u00d6GD Evaluation of the regional networks and adaptation of the intervention measures following evaluation by the L\u00e4nder/\u00d6GD 34 | 5 DART in the field of human medicine Milestone: Starting in 2012, evaluation group compris - ing representatives of the L\u00e4nder, the \u00d6GD, universities and the RKI Implementation of workshops for network moderators in the public health service Milestone :2009; Academy of Public Health and LIGA Participants: BMG, RKI, L\u00e4nder authorities, Infection Protection Work - ing Group, \u00d6GD, hospitals, (private) microbiological cen - tres/laboratories, outpatient practices, rehabilitation facilities and nursing homes, SHI, PKV, Regional Associa - tions of SHI-Accredited Physicians, National Association of SHI-Accredited Physicians, State Chambers of Physicians, German Medical Association, Scientific Advisory Board of the German Medical Association, Drug Commission of the German Medical Association, scientific societies, profes - sional associations, universities, G-BA, Freiburg Centre for Infectious Diseases, NRC for Surveillance of Nosocomial Infections, Academy of Public Health and LIGA Sub-goal 6.2: Cooperation at the Federal Government level Requirement: Strengthening if interministerial cooperation in the field of antimicrobial resistance Background: Antimicrobial resistances occur in human and veterinary medicine, as well as in the environment. The increasing rise in resistance rates and the ubiquitous occurrence of resistances call for a common, interdepartmental strate - gy for detecting, preventing and controlling antimicro - bial resistances in Germany, and also for the coordination of activities for implementing the strategy. T o this end, an Interministerial Working Group for the field of antimicrobial resistance is intended to ensure a dia - logue between the players at the Federal Government level. In this Working Group, the competent Federal Min - istries will be responsible for interdepartmental coordina - tion of antimicrobial resistance policy in Germany, involv - ing the competent higher federal authorities in the process. The Interministerial Working Group will initially be chaired by the BMG. The goals, tasks and members of the Interministerial Working Group should be defined at a first meeting. Each department is responsible for coordinating the plan - ning, implementation and controlling of concrete proj - ects and actions in its respective sphere. In addition, inter - departmental projects are also to be planned. The Interministerial Working Group will also be responsi - ble for interdisciplinary, continuous co-ordination, plan - ning, evaluation, adaptation and expansion of national antimicrobial resistance policy, making it possible to react to new resistance problems. National experts in the field of antimicrobial resistance are to be involved in this context (see also Goal 3). Actions: Establishment of an Interministerial Working Group on Antimicrobial Resistance for interdisciplinary coordina - tion, planning, evaluation, adaptation and expansion of national antimicrobial resistance policy Milestone : By mid-2008, initiation by the Participants: competent higher federal authorities Sub-goal 6.3: Coordination of activities at the national level Requirement: A coordinating centre for the prevention and control of antimicrobial resistance at the national level Background: Numerous activities, projects and recommendations in the field of antimicrobial resistance exist in Germany under very different competences. There has so far been no adequate, top-level, continuous coordination and assessment of these activities. This makes it more difficult to obtain an overview of the resistance situation and coor - dinate control measures in Germany. Consequently, there is a need to pool, coordinate and assess activities. Many activities in the field of antimicrobial resistance are already part of the sphere of responsibility of the Robert Koch Institute (see also Goals 1 and 2). As a result of being expanded to take on the role of the national Public Health Institute, the Robert Koch Institute is also becoming increasingly qualified for the central position that it will in future assume at the professional level in the field of antimicrobial resistance in human medicine. Moreover, the Robert Koch Institute will also provide pro - fessional advice at the international, national, regional and local levels. This will include advising the L\u00e4nder authorities, the public health service and players in regional networks (see also Sub-goal 6.1), as well as advis - ing politicians, expert circles and the public. Actions: Establishment of an agency at the RKI for assessment and advice on the field of antimicrobial resistance, 5 DART in the field of human medicine | 35 e.g. a \"Centre for Prevention and Control of Antimicro - bial Resistance\" Milestone: By the end of 2008, under the management of the RKI Participants: BMG, RKI, L\u00e4nder, scientific societies GOAL 7 International cooperation Requirement: Promotion of international cooperation and strengthen - ing of Germany's position in international networks Background: International cooperation, particularly with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), will be strengthened by implementing the strategy. The exchange of information and data with European and international partners permits an assessment of the resist - ance situation in Germany and can indicate new solution approaches and prospects for reducing antimicrobial resistance. International cooperation is particularly necessary in con - nection with the containment of infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistances, since the transmission of (resis - tant) pathogens will continue to rise as a result of growing globalisation and the increasing mobility of the popula - tion. Moreover, antimicrobial resistance is a high-priority topic for the ECDC. Some of the activities planned by the ECDC in the field of antimicrobial resistance go hand-in-hand with activities within the strategy. This offers Germany the opportunity to actively participate in European activities, voice German interests and advance the control and avoidance of antimicrobial resistance at the global level. Implementation of the strategy also aims to strengthen Germany's position in international networks. At the same time, the principal goals formulated in the Recommenda - tion of the European Commission on the prudent use of antimicrobial agents in human medicine (2002/77/EC) are actively implemented. Actions: Strengthening of German participation in internation - al projects and networks, e.g. EARSS and ESAC Milestone: By the end of 2010, under the management of the RKI Participants: BMG, RKI, scientific societies COMPONENT IV: Research and evaluation GOAL 8 Promotion of evaluation measures in human medicine Requirement: Evaluation of measures for controlling and minimising antimicrobial resistance Background: Numerous intervention measures can be introduced in order to promote the appropriate use of antibiotics and reduce antimicrobial resistance rates. 2,32 Only additional studies can determine whether intervention measures, e.g. new treatment measures, are effective. This requires an analysis of the actual situation in advance and evalua - tion following introduction of the interven-tion meas - ure. 23,25 In the framework of the present strategy, an initial analysis is to examine the factors influencing antibiotic prescrib - ing practices and (previously) successful interventions for promoting the efficient use of antibiotics in human medi - cine. Rising resistance rates, increasing consumption of broad- spectrum antibiotics and major regional differences in antibiotic consumption in Germany suggest that physi - cians occasionally prescribe antibiotics inappropriately. Next to no information is available on the factors govern - ing the practices of physicians in outpatient and inpatient care in Germany, or on how relevant these factors are. However, to be able to introduce targeted interventions for reducing antibiotic consumption in Germany, there is first a need to know the influencing factors that lead to antibiotics being prescribed, and also their individual rele - vance. Therefore, the following questions are to be investigated in a study: Which factors influence physicians in Germany when prescribing antibiotics? What is the relevance of these influencing factors when prescribing antibiotics? What instruments or measures are suitable for promot - ing appropriate prescribing of antibiotics and thus counteracting the increasing development of resist - ances? In addition, the application by physicians of diagnostic (rapid-test) methods, and of recommendations and 36 | 5 DART in the field of human medicine guidelines for antibiotic therapy, is to be surveyed, as well as their benefits as regards the prescribing of antibiotics (see also Goals 3 and 4). The results of the study will permit characterisation of the influencing factors, and targeted intervention measures can then be introduced on this basis. Moreover, patients are to be asked about the correct intake of antibiotics, their expectations of physicians regarding the prescribing of antibiotics, and their knowl - edge in this field. If appropriate, the results of this survey are subsequently to be used as a basis for implementing a targeted education campaign for the general public. This could achieve substantial savings, both in individual med - ical institutions and in the health system as a whole. The strategy, and the projects and actions it contains, are simultaneously to be evaluated by the ECDC. The ECDC has past experience with evaluating the EU Member States in the field of antimicrobial resistance. A study of the actual situation in the field of antimicrobial resistance in Germany was already performed by the ECDC in Octo - ber 2007. Actions: Study of the antibiotic prescribing practices of physi - cians in Germany (funding has already started) Milestone: By the end of 2008, under the management of the RKI Survey of patients on the correct intake of antibiotics and their expectations of physicians when it comes to prescribing antibiotics Milestone: By the end of 2009, under the management of the RKI Evaluation of the national Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy Milestone: Ongoing, under the management of the ECDC Adaptation of the German Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy Milestone: Ongoing, under the management of the BMG Participants: BMG, RKI, State Chambers of Physicians, German Medical Association, Brandenburg State Chamber of Physicians, outpatient and inpatient physicians prescribing antibi - otics, SHI, PKV, Regional Associations SHI-Accredited Physicians, National Association of SHI-Accredited Physi - cians, scientific societies, professional associations, ECDC, KRINKO GOAL 9 Promotion of knowledge transfer in the field of antimicrobial resistance Requirement: Strengthening of knowledge transfer between antimicro - bial resistance research, practice and the public Background: The possibility of creating an Internet-based platform on antimicrobial resistance for physicians and medical occu - pational groups is being examined to promote the appro - priate use of antibiotics. In addition to information on infections, the action of antibiotics, resistance develop - ment and new antibiotics, the site could also be used to publish generally acknowledged recommendations and guidelines for antibiotic therapy (see also Goal 3) and sig - nificant research results relating to antimicrobial resist - ance. Experts and professional circles would have rapid access to new, practice-relevant measures and/or guide - lines in the field of antimicrobial resistance. An Internet- based platform permits a rapid exchange of information and up-to-date information at all times. To increase knowledge transfer between research and everyday clini - cal or practice work, it would also be possible to compile and assess current and significant research results or infor - mation on the efficacy of new substances in one area of the platform. Consequently, the first step should be to determine the need for a platform of this kind (see Goal 8). In addition, education and information of the general public in the field of antimicrobial resistance can also pro - mote the correct intake of antibiotics and thus contribute to the fight against antimicrobial resistance. Actions: Examination of the need for, and feasibility of, an Inter - net-based platform on antimicrobial resistance Milestone: By the end of 2009, under the management of the RKI Development of an information sheet on the safe use of antibiotics, and expansion of the information on com - mon illnesses in the cold months for which antibiotics are used, in the framework of the Health Information for the Public Milestone: By the end of 2008, IQWiG Recommendation on use of the Health Information for the Public of the IQWiG by health insurance funds to educate and inform insureds Milestone: Starting in 2009, SHI Provision of specific information offerings for SHI- accredited physicians, e.g. in the context of quality cir - cle work Milestone: Starting in 2009, KBV 5 DART in the field of human medicine | 37 T arget group-oriented selection, preparation and for - warding of information in the field of antimicrobial resistance Milestone: Starting in 2009, B\u00c4K and L\u00c4K Review of the possibility of, and need for, further educa - tion and information for the public Milestone: Starting in 2009, under the management of the BMG Participants: BMG, RKI, scientific societies, State Chambers of Physi - cians, German Medical Association, SHI, PKV, Regional Associations of SHI-Accredited Physicians, National Asso - ciation of SHI-Accredited Physicians, IQWiG, BZgA GOAL 10 Networking and strengthening of science in the field of antimicrobial resistance Requirement: Analysis of the need for research into antimicrobial resist - ance Background: Containing resistances will be an important task in the years to come. The subject of antimicrobial resistance is already being dealt with in various measures of the BMBF. However, there is a need for coordinated activity for net - working that, for example, also closes the gap between re0search on the development of antimicrobial resist - ance, the spread of resistances and the measures for con - taining resistances. Actions: Determination of deficits and problems in research in the field of antimicrobial resistance in Germany Milestone: By the end of 2009, under the management of the BMBF Participants: BMBF, BMG, BMELV, BMU, science, industry 6 DART in the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity 6.1 Existing measures for minimising anti - microbial resistance The significance for human health described above already led in the past to the introduction of a number of measures for minimising antimicrobial resistances in the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity. Specifications of the European Community and supranational specifications (WHO/FAO/Codex Alimentar - ius) were taken into account and implemented in the con - text of these measures. Measures aimed at minimising the occurrence of antimi - crobial resistance must be scientifically sound and give consideration to the need for effective antibiotics in ani - mal healthcare to restore the health of animals. One aim of the measures for minimising antimicrobial resistances in veterinary medicine is to ensure the protection of con - sumer health. In this spirit, measures also have to be taken in the framework of preventive consumer protection if risk assessment indicates their necessity in individual instances. The measures taken in such a case have to be scientifically verified. restriction of the indications for antibiotics of particular therapeutic importance in human medicine, recommen - dations on standard in-vitro susceptibility testing (prepa - ration of antibiograms) for certain infective agents in ani - mals, demand for resistance data when applying for regis - tration and re-registration of antibiotics. Fig. 2 Sales figures for antibiotics in veterinary medicine in German y21 6.1.1.1 Legal bases The German Drug Law (AMG) regulates transactions involving medicinal products, including veterinary medicinal products, but excluding veterinary vaccines. Among other things, the AMG contains the fundamental specifications for the registration, production, sale and use of veterinary medicinal products, including antibi - otics. The following are some of the additional regula - tions applicable to antibiotics: Mandatory Prescription of Medicinal Products Ordi - nance (AMVV, regulates the mandatory prescription of antibiotics, etc.) Ordinance on the Specification of Requirements for the Application for Marketing Authorisation, Prolongation of the Authorisation and Registration of Medicinal Products German Drug Law Documentation Submission Ordi - nance Ordinance on the Documentation Obligations of Ani - mal Owners for Medicinal Products Intended for Use in Animals b) Ordinance on the Electronic Notification of Side Effects General Administrative Regulation on the Surveillance, Collection and Evaluation of Drug Risks (Graduated Plan) according to Section 63 German Drug Law 6 DART in the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity | 39 Similarly, the measures to be taken must be capable of effectively fulfilling specifications concerning the han - dling of antimicrobial resistances in animals that affect international trade (OIE, WHO/FAO/Codex Alimentarius). 6.1.1 Measures in Germany The measures taken to date, or currently being imple - mented, are attributable, inter alia, to two international symposia, held in 2003 and 2004 at the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) and the Federal Office for Con - sumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL) on risk assessment and the minimisation of antimicrobial resistance in the sense of a risk management measure. In addition, the Ger - man Veterinary Association established measures in Ger - many as long ago as 2000, e.g. the Guidelines for prudent use of antimicrobial agents in veterinary medicine (Antibi - otic Guidelines). In the scientific sector, the subject of resistance is dealt with in the former BGVV (now BfR and BVL) and, for more than 20 years and with international standing, formerly in the Federal Agricultural Research Centre (FAL) and now at the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI), all in the portfolio of the BMELV. Among other things, this has resulted in recommendations for action for veteri - nary practice, also in cooperation with the German Socie - ty for Veterinary Medicine (DVG). All antibiotics for veterinary medicine are available on prescription only. So-called antibiotic performance promoters a) in animal feed have been banned throughout Europe since 2006. Various performance promoters have been successively banned in the Community since 2000, or are no longer used for lack of acceptance among consumers. As a result, overall antibiotic consumption in the field of animal hus - bandry has declined in Germany. At present, however, only estimates 21 are available in Germany regarding the sales figures for antibiotics, but they nevertheless permit conclusions to be drawn about the significance and mar - ket shares of certain antibiotics. The following measures have essentially been completed: elaboration of Antibiotic Guidelines (Federal Chamber of Veterinaries), implementation of continuing education measures, restriction of the sale of systemic antibiotics and ban on farm mixes by the 11th AMG Amendment, a) Enterically non-absorbable antibiotics that were allowed to be added to the feed of certain farm animals as EC-approved feed additives for improving fattening performance and stabilising intestinal health. b) This Ordinance applies to businesses that keep food-producing animals. 6.7 % macr olides 10.8 % others (4.6 % amino - glycosides , 2.8 % polypeptides, 1.5 % lincosamides , 0.6 pheni- 0.5 % fluoroquinolones) % sulphonamides (+ 25.4 % beta laktams 44.6 % tetracyclines = 784.4 Tons in 2005 40 | 6 DART in the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity Veterinary House Dispensary Ordinance (T\u00c4HAV) Certificate Accompanying Medicated Foodstuffs according to Section 56 Para. 1 AMG General Administrative Regulation on the Application of Medicinal Product T esting Guidelines for Veterinary Medicinal Products The German Drug Law and the implementing regulations enact the specifications of European law in Germany. The registration of veterinary medicinal products in Germany is based on the specifications envisaged in Community law. As a general rule, there is a ban on treatment of certain epizootic diseases (e.g. brucellosis) under Germany's Epi - zootic Diseases Act, and a ban on treatment of salmonel - la-infected poultry flocks exists under Regulation (EC) No. 1177/2006. 42 In addition, food law serves as a basis for implementing studies on the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic agents or pathogens of importance for human health in the food chain. The studies range from the living animal to trade in foods of animal origin (General Adminis - trative Regulation on Zoonoses in the Food Chain). 6.1.1.2 Monitoring In Germany, the L\u00e4nder are responsible for monitoring the regulations of drug law, epizootic disease law and food law. The Federal Government provides facilities for har - monising and standardising methods and investigations (e.g. reference laboratories), as well as for pooling and assessing results. 6.1.1.2.1 National Reference Laboratory for Antimicrobial Resistance A National Reference Laboratory for Antimicrobial Resist - ance (NRL Antimicrobial Resistance) has been established at the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) in Ger - many in the framework of the specifications of Regulation (EC) No. 882/200449. The laboratory performs the tasks specified in Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No. 882/2004. The National Reference Laboratory is particularly intend - ed to contribute to achieving high quality and consisten - cy of the results of studies on zoonotic agents. The work focuses on collecting comparable data on antimicrobial resistance for zoonotic agents and other pathogens, inso - far as they pose a threat to public health. T o this end, the NRL Antimicrobial Resistance coordinates selection of the isolates to be tested from the food chain with the L\u00e4nder and their testing institutions, also itself performing resist - ance testing on isolates originating from animals, food - stuffs and feedstuffs, and from the environment. T esting for resistances is performed on a routine basis, using inter - nationally acknowledged, quantitative methods in an accredited laboratory unit. The quality of the results is ensured by participation in international interlaboratory tests (e.g. at the Community Reference Laboratory (CRL) for Antimicrobial Resistance). Numerous modern meth - ods of molecular biology are used for targeted epidemio - logical testing of resistances, their molecular bases, trans - mission and spread. The NRL engages in intensive cooper - ation with the CRL for Antimicrobial Resistance to this end. Standardisation of the tests for antimicrobial resist - ance is a prerequisite for consistent monitoring of the occurrence of resistances. It permits data exchange and comparison at the national and international level. In this context, the methods based on the specifications of food law, including the cut-off values, so far differ from the rec - ommendations for testing clinical cases. 6.1.1.2.2 Monitoring and testing of pathogens of impor - tance for human health In the framework of Directive 2003/99/EC 47 , the Member States are to collect data on the prevalence of zoonoses and zoonotic agents and their antimicrobial resistances in animals, foodstuffs, feedstuffs and humans, in order to obtain information on the development trends and sources of zoonoses and the resistance situation. These data are compiled by the L\u00e4nder and the municipalities, then being pooled centrally and assessed nationally. Above and beyond this, the data are also evaluated by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Article 7 of the Directive forms the legal basis for further measures to be implemented in the Community. Attention currently focuses on monitoring Salmonella in poultry and Campylobacter in poultry in the framework of limited- period studies (Decision 2007/516/EC 44 ). Decision 2007/407/EC 43 has committed Germany to monitor the antimicrobial resistances of Salmonella in poultry and pigs in the framework of the basic studies since 2007 (turkeys and fattening pigs) and the programmes for con - trolling Salmonella in these animals that have to be implemented in accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 2160/2003 48 and its associated Regulations. Moreover, the prevalence and resistance attributes of methicillin-resist - ant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are being monitored in a study on breeding pigs, which is also being expanded by the L\u00e4nder on a voluntary basis to include available fatten - ing holdings in the framework of the study (Decision 2008/55/EC 45 ). In this context, the task of the NRL Antimi - crobial Resistance is to coordinate the studies and meas - ures, and to provide the competent laboratories of the L\u00e4nder with method recommendations. The nationwide implementation of the survey of antimicrobial resistance, 6 DART in the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity | 41 and of Decision 2007/407/EC, is regulated by the provi - sions of the General Administrative Regulations on the Recording, Evaluation and Publication of Data on the Occurrence of Zoonoses and Zoonotic Agents in the Food Chain (General Administrative Regulation on Zoonoses in the Food Chain, Federal Gazette 106, p. 2587). The BfR can propose additional measures in this framework, also for other zoonotic agents. MRSA is to be taken into considera - tion in the sampling plan for zoonosis monitoring from 2009 to 2011 on the basis of this General Administrative Regulation on Zoonoses in the Food Chain. 6.1.1.2.3 Monitoring of resistance in zoonotic agents Since 2001, the BVL has been conducting a continuous, annual data collection and investigation regarding the susceptibility of clinical bacterial isolates (GERM-Vet programme) to selected antibacterial agents. The data are collected according to a detailed, statistically proven sampling plan that is modified annually in keeping with the current situation. Since the 2006/2007 study, the range of bacteria covered has been expanded to include isolates from diseased non-food-producing animals. The bacterial isolates are sent in by state (L\u00e4nder) and private laboratories, and epidemiological parameters (e.g. data on herd size, type of use, type of housing, animal age and sampling date) are collected at the same time. The regional share of the number of bacterial strains per species is calculated on the basis of the total livestock fig - ures for the individual L\u00e4nder. The data are recorded and communicated by means of a web-based database. The minimum inhibitory concentration is determined and assessed (method: bouillon microdilution) at the BVL according to the CLSI c) standard. In addition to establish - ing the current resistance situation, this also permits early detection of a change in the resistance situation in Ger - many. All isolates are preserved in a master collection. A monitoring programme complementary to the GERM- Vet programme was carried out in Germany under the name BfT-GERM-Vet in the period 2004 to 2006 d) . The BfT- GERM-Vet study was implemented by a consortium com - prising scientists from the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI), the Free University of Berlin, the Ludwig Maximilian Uni - versity of Munich and the Federal Office for Consumer Pro - tection and Food Safety (BVL). This study examined pathogens from a total of 31 bacteria/animal/disease process combinations regarding their susceptibility to 24 antimicrobial active substances and active substance combinations. In contrast to GERM-Vet, the BfT-GERM-Vet study focused on bacterial infective agents of the animal species dog, cat and horse. Bacteria from cattle and pigs were additionally examined that originated from disease processes not included in the studies of the GERM-Vet pro - gramme. BfT-GERM-Vet and GERM-Vet adhered to the same sample collection plan and used the same CLSI method for susceptibility testing by means of bouillon microdilution and for assessing the results obtained. Moreover, the bacterial isolates for both studies, BfT- GERM-Vet and GERM-Vet, were provided by largely the same diagnostic institutions of the L\u00e4nder and veterinary medical training institutions, as well as the same private diagnostic laboratories. The complete results of the BfT- GERM-Vet study, and selected results of GERM-Vet, were published in a special issue of Berliner und M\u00a7nchener Tier\u00e4rztliche Wochenschrift in autumn 2007. T ogether with the Paul Ehrlich Society (PEG) and with the involvement of experts, the BVL is, as a member of the coordination group, currently compiling an \"Atlas of Antimicrobial Resistance and Antibiotic Consumption in Germany\", which will incorporate both consumption and resistance data from human medicine and resistance data from the GERM-Vet programme and the BfT-GERM-Vet project. The Resistance Atlas was presented to the public at a press conference in the framework of the annual conference of the PEG in October 2008. 6.1.1.2.4 Active substance-specific monitoring studies Using the CLSI method for susceptibility testing by means of bouillon microdilution, the Institute of Farm Animal Genetics of the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI) performed, from 2000 to 2007, continuous monitoring of bovine (Pas - to flor - fenicol. Monitoring of coagulase-negative staphylococci from cases of subclinical mastitis in dairy cows for susceptibility to pirlimycin and reference substances was additionally performed from 2004 to 2006. Both studies represent investigations into the resistance development of pathogens relevant in veterinary medi - cine to antimicrobial active substances that have only been used therapeutically in veterinary medicine for a rel - atively short time. The molecular studies carried out paral - lel to these two monitoring studies on the underlying resistance genes and mechanisms in resistant isolates constitute an important component with respect to a \"hazard identification\" in the framework of a risk analysis. c) Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute d) A voluntary initiative of the BfT 42 | 6 DART in the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity 6.1.1.3 Registration and pharmacovigilance for antibiotics for veterinary medicine The registration of antibiotics for veterinary medicine, and also supervision of the products following registra - tion, is managed by the Federal Office for Consumer Pro - tection and Food Safety (BVL). As a general rule, all antibi - otics registered for use in veterinary medicine are subject to mandatory prescription. 6.1.1.3.1 Registration requirements for antibiotics for veterinary medicine The BVL examines registration applications and decides on the registration of antibiotics on the basis of the EU law implemented in the AMG, also giving consideration to relevant EU Guidelines 29,51 for national applications. In principle, the same registration requirements exist for both known and new substances. As regards the resist - ance problem, information particularly has to be submit - ted concerning the fields of pharmacokinetics, pharma - codynamics, toxicology, ecotoxicology, the residue situa - tion and clinical aspects. Among other things, the appli - cant must, for example, investigate and demonstrate the degradation path of substances with antimicrobial activity. To demonstrate the susceptibility of claimed target pathogens, the applicant is required to submit represen - tative MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) e) values from the past five years. Moreover, comprehensive data have to be provided regarding resistance (development, mechanisms, cross and co-resistance). 51 Furthermore, when registering antibiotics for food-producing animals, additional data have to be submitted regarding suscepti - bility and resistance, also in relation to the resistance risk for humans. The data to be provided in this context refer to zoonotic agents and commensal organisms (salmonel - lae, Campylobacter, enterococci and E. coli) 29 . The expert information and instructions for use include standard notes for the veterinary, agreed on at the EU level, that are intended to promote prudent use of medicinal products of this kind. For instance, the standard sentence \"- should only be used after preparation of an antibiogram\" is nowadays required for all antibiotics. If the resistance situation is unclear, the BVL makes use of its powers to impose conditions in the context of registra - tion, e.g. in the form of a Post-Marketing Monitoring programme. 6.1.1.3.2 Pharmacovigilance The World Health Organization (WHO) defines pharma - covigilance as all activities concerning the discovery, assessment, understanding and prevention of side effects or other problems relating to medicinal products. Accord - ing to Section 63b AMG, the pharmaceutical manufactur - er is obliged to collect and assess reports from users and official agencies concerning veterinary medicinal prod - ucts, and to take suitable action for averting risks, where appropriate. The competent higher federal authorities are to be informed accordingly. To prevent threats to human and animal health, the competent registration authorities are required to centrally record and evaluate the risks occurring when using veterinary medicinal prod - ucts, especially side effects, interactions with other agents, adulteration and potential risks for the environ - ment resulting from use of a veterinary medicinal prod - uct, and to coordinate the measures to be taken accord - ing to the AMG (Section 62 AMG). The details are regulated by the General Administrative Regulation on the Graduated Plan. According to Article 1 No. 3 of this General Administrative Regulation, the devel - opment of resistance to anti-infective agents is one of the drug risks to be monitored, collected and evaluated. Above and beyond the registration approval, pharmaceu - tical manufacturers are fundamentally obliged to moni - tor the efficacy and resistance development of the respective antibiotic in the framework of pharmacovigi - lance. Regular reports are to be submitted and, if neces - sary, the registration adapted by means of amendment procedures in keeping with the new findings. 6.1.1.4 Regulations on the sale of antibiotics for systemic use As a general rule, the veterinary surgeon himself adminis - ters antibiotics to animals -in direct connection with examination and diagnosis. However, antibiotics are also sold to animal owners for continuing therapy or for group treatment. The AMG contains specific regulations concerning the sale of antibiotics for systemic use in food-producing ani - mals to animal owners by veterinary surgeons. As for all pharmacy-only veterinary medicinal products, systemic antibiotics may as a general rule only be sold for animals e) The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is the smallest active substan - ce concentration of an antimicrobial substance (e.g. of an antibiotic) that still prevents pathogen multiplication in culture. 6 DART in the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity | 43 treated by the veterinary surgeon. The details are regulat - ed in Section 12 of the Veterinary House Dispensary Ordi - nance (T\u00c4HAV, Federal Law Gazette I, p. 3455, 2006). Addi - tionally, antibiotics for systemic use in the treatment of food-producing animals may only be sold in quantities suf - ficient for a maximum of seven days (\"7-day regulation\" according to Section 56a AMG). Exceptions are antibiotics for which therapy lasting longer than seven days is expressly specified according to the registration docu - ments. This regulation is intended to help ensure that antibiotics are only used immediately around the time of diagnosis. 6.1.1.4.1 Recording of the quantities of antibiotics sold To assess the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance, there is a need to record the quantities of antibiotics sold. This makes it possible to identify and eval - uate possible links between the quantities of antibiotics used and developments in the field of antimicrobial resist - ance, so that the information obtained can be taken into consideration in risk assessment and risk management. Section 47 Para. 1c of the German Drug Law (AMG) there - fore contains the legal basis for recording the quantities of antibiotics sold, which is currently being elaborated. There is a need to be able to establish a regional connec - tion between the quantities of the respective antibiotic sold and regional resistance data for assessment of the resistance risk. In addition to the quantities of antibiotics sold, an appro - priate assessment should also take into account further data, especially data broken down by region concerning the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals, the nature of the livestock holdings, holding structures, including the size of the holdings, and the infection situa - tion in the period under review. 6.1.1.4.2 Recording of the quantities of antibiotics used Any use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine creates the possibility of selection of antimicrobial resistances in bacteria occurring in animals. A relationship has been described between the use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine and the development of resistances in humans. The quantity of antibiotics used is an important influenc - ing variable that must be taken into account when consid - ering the phenomenon of antimicrobial resistance as a whole. The combined basis of consumption quantities and epidemiological data makes it possible to examine the correlation existing between the quantity of antibi - otics used and the development and spread of antimicro - bial resistance. Statements regarding the quantities of antibiotics consumed are therefore also significant for assessing the question of whether these antibiotics pose a threat for humans or animals. The currently valid regulations of drug law only permit recording of the quantity of antimicrobial agents sold to veterinary surgeons by pharmaceutical manufacturers (Section 47 Para. 1c German Drug Law, see Chapter 6.1.1.4.1). On the occasion of the international symposium \"Risk Management for Containing Antimicrobial Resistance\", held at the BVl in late 2004, a call was made for detailed recording of consumption quantities as a risk manage - ment measure, and for creation of the necessary statutory basis. A project being implemented by the BfR on behalf of the BMELV is therefore examining what method could be used for representative recording of consumption quantities on the basis of existing, prescribed records of treatments performed on animals and sales of veterinary medicinal products to animal owners. Particularly important in this context is the question of representative data recording in veterinary practices and livestock businesses, as well as the question of pro-cessing these data and forwarding them to the competent higher federal authorities. As a result of the project, it is to be possible to present frame - work criteria for the legal regulation of the recording of consumption quantities. Should the research project prove capable of developing a method that can be used nationwide for the representa - tive recording of consumption quantities, the possibility must be examined of introducing regulations in drug law on compulsory recording of the quantities of antibiotics used in food-producing animals. The data then resulting from the recording of consumption quantities are to be suitable for use for permanent risk assessment of antimi - crobial resistance development by the higher federal authorities. The project is specifically intended to examine technically feasible ways of recording the quantities of antibiotics consumed. T o this end, a model is first to be developed for statistically representative recording of the quantities of antibiotics used in food-producing animals by evaluating the information in the stock records of animal owners and in usage and sales records of veterinary surgeons. The data recording method developed will be tested in a field trial to determine whether/how and at what expense con - sumption quantities can be recorded nationwide in Ger -44 | 6 DART in the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity many. Up to now, data on consumption quantities are available only in published surveys by Hanover University of Veteri - nary Medicine in collaboration with the supervisory authorities in Schleswig-Holstein from 2002 and 2003 7-11 and in a doctoral thesis from the University of Leipzig on the development of the use of antimicrobially active vet - erinary medicinal products in medicated foodstuffs 93 . 6.1.1.5 Antibiotic Guidelines Since November 2000, the German Veterinary Associa - tion and the former Working Group of Senior Veterinary Inspectors (ArgeVet) have, with the involvement of the affected interest groups and the Federal Ministries, estab - lished \"Guidelines for the prudent use of antimicrobially active veterinary medicinal products\". These Antibiotic Guidelines are currently being amended to reflect the lat - est scientific knowledge and the conditions prevailing in practice, in order to ensure that they give veterinary sur - geons a dependable guide enabling the safe use of antibi - otics and safeguarding animal health. These Guidelines set forth the principles for treating animals with antibi - otics (not only for food-producing animals). They present the rules of veterinary medical science for the use of antibiotics that must be observed in any correct treat - ment according to Sections 1a and 12 of the Veterinary House Dispensary Ordinance (T\u00c4HAV, Federal Law Gazette I, No. 66, p. 3455). For example, these Guidelines define the framework for the use of antibiotics in meta - phylaxis and therapy. Similarly, the veterinary surgeon is called upon to review the efficacy of his therapy and to prepare an antibiogram when changing antibiotics in order to critically appraise the use of the antibiotic. 6.1.1.6 Use of antibiotically active substances in food pro - duction A further aspect is the use of antibiotically active sub - stances in food production. For reasons of preventive con - sumer protection, antibiotically active substances, espe - cially substances also used in human medicine, are only to be used in foods on an extremely restrictive basis and not beyond the sphere approved to date. In food production, the use of natamycin (synonym: pimaricin) as a food additive is approved for treating the surface of various types of hard cheese, as well as dried and salted meats/sausages. In this context, the natamycin content may not exceed 1 mg/dm 2surface area, and the substance may not be detectable 5 mm below the sur - face. In human medicine, natamycin is used as an antimycotic for topical treatment of yeast infections of the intestine and mycotic infections of the mouth, eyes, eyelids and lacrimal ducts. It is not absorbed in the intestines. As generally envisaged by the procedure for registering food additives at the level of Community law, and also at the international level (Codex Alimentarius), natamycin was also assessed by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Commit - tee on Food Additives (JECFA) on several occasions (1968, 1976, 2002, 2003), and by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) of the EU Commission in 1979, as regards the safety, in terms of health, of use in foods, specifically against the backdrop of the issue of possible antimicrobial resistance. In this context, general-purpose use in or on foods was considered to be unacceptable, whereas the use of natamycin for treating the surface of the rind of semi-hard cheese matured under aerobic conditions, and for treating the surface of the skin of specific types of sausage requiring a certain maturing process prior to marketing, was accepted on the following conditions: Only the end product is treated with natamycin, At the time of sale, the natamycin residues on the foods, expressed in relation to the surface of the sausage skin or cheese rind, may not exceed 1 mg/dm2 and not be detectable 5 mm below the surface. Moreover, the SCF -and also the BfR -expressed strict opposition to any more extensive use of natamycin, e.g. for treating the surface of ham, wine and other bever - ages. These requirements of the SCF were taken into account when registering natamycin in the entire EU (see above). In a statement issued in 2003, the BfR additionally pointed out that consumers should be advised to remove cheese rinds or the outer layer of cheese that does not have a typ - ical cheese rind or on which no rind is to be seen. This is aimed to counteract the danger of consumers uninten - tionally taking in small quantities of natamycin, as a result of which the microflora of the intestinal tract could be affected and resistances could occur. The Commission of the European Communities, and the Committee on Consumer Affairs, Public Health and Con - sumer Policy of the European Parliament, advocated that antibiotics used in human medicine be employed only restrictively in foods. 6.1.1.7 Use of streptomycin against fire blight in pomace - ous fruit 6 DART in the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity | 45 Fire blight is a bacterial disease (pathogenic agent: Erwinia amylovora) that can cause severe losses, especial - ly in pomaceous fruit (apples, pears, quinces). Of the approx. 40,000 hectares (ha) of pomaceous fruit (dwarf fruit tree orchards) in Germany, the growing regions in the southern L\u00e4nder currently face the greatest risk for cli - matic reasons. Baden-W\u00a7rttemberg is particularly hard- hit, with approx. 11,000 ha apple and pear orchards, including approx. 7,200 ha in the Lake Constance area alone. Should climate change progress, the severely affected areas will grow. Since 1993, there have been financial losses due to fire blight in many L\u00e4nder, including uprooting of severely affected orchards. 2007 was a par - ticularly bad year for the disease. Although trade journals repeatedly offer new control methods and a number of plant protection agents and plant strengtheners are available, it has so far not been possible to find a substitute for the use of plant protection agents containing antibiotics that offers the necessary degree of reliability. Nonetheless, it continues to be a demand widely supported in society as a whole that the use of antibiotics be restricted as extensively as possible for reasons of consumer protection. 6.1.1.7.1 First strategy from 2003 A first strategy, geared to a five-year period, was adopted in 2003 with the support of all affected authorities at the Federal and L\u00e4nder level, as well as of the affected associa - tions in the fields of fruit-growing, bee-keeping, con - sumer protection, environmental protection and nature conservation. This strategy was generally rated as a suc - cess by all concerned, but it has still not proved possible to achieve the goal of ultimately dispensing with the use of plant protection agents containing antibiotics. It was therefore agreed that the \"Strategy for Controlling Fire Blight in Fruit-Growing without Antibiotics\" should be updated and pursued for a further five years, but with con - tinuing annual reviews. The aim of the Strategy for Con - trolling Fire Blight in Fruit-Growing without Antibiotics is to comprehensively and specifically fulfil the demands of society as a whole. This strategy paper first provides an in- depth review of the situation in fire blight research, devel - opments and the currently available control options. Both the possibilities existing in the framework of the cultiva - tion methods and direct control methods are discussed. Each descriptive section ends with an assessment by the experts involved in developing the Strategy for Control - ling Fire Blight in Fruit-Growing without Antibiotics. 6.1.1.7.2 Orderly termination of the use of antibiotics Following exhaustive discussions, the conclusion was drawn that a need for orderly termination of the use of antibiotics to control fire blight results from the assess - ment of possible residual risks and the concept of preven - tive consumer protection. It can be assumed that society as a whole will only be willing to accept the use of plant protection agents containing antibiotics for a limited time to come. All the action taken to date is currently insufficient for reducing the risk of infection with fire blight to such an extent that the use of plant protection agents containing streptomycin can be completely aban - doned. Given this background and the existing efforts to establish effective alternatives to controlling the agent causing fire blight with plant protection agents contain - ing antibiotics, the strategy is to approve the use of plant protection agents containing streptomycin on a short- term basis and only in cases where it is absolutely neces - sary, although the ultimate objective is to dispense com - pletely with the use of plant protection agents containing antibiotics. A comprehensive strategy for controlling fire blight with - out antibiotics must take the following aspects into con - sideration, in particular: By taking suitable measures, the predisposition of the fruit trees should be reduced to such an extent that only an unavoidable risk of infection remains. All the available preventive measures and procedures should be exhausted. Direct plant protection measures for controlling fire blight (use of plant protection agents) are only to be taken if this is unavoidable, despite all cultivation-relat - ed measures. The regulations of the Fire Blight Ordinance should be reviewed and enforced by the L\u00e4nder consistently and as uniformly as possible. The separately elaborated strategy for controlling fire blight, geared to ecological farming, is to be further developed. All measures included in the strategy must enable bee- keepers and fruit-growers to continue to produce hon - ey and fruit economically. The level of protection required in valid food and plant protection law must be observed without fail, especial - ly with a view to preventive consumer protection. The catalogue of measures that follows covers a very broad approach. It encompasses measures in the fields of plant cultivation and plant protection methods, plant breeding, research, plant protection agents and plant strengtheners, stone fruits, bee-keeping, possibilities for 46 | 6 DART in the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity problem containment, adaptation of the Fire Blight Ordi - nance, ecological farming, public relations work and mar - keting. The official agencies or associations involved are responsible for realising the measures. Regarding approval by the BVL of the putting into circulation and use of plant protection agents containing streptomycin, which is part of the measures, the strategy paper already sets out a very narrow framework that is also linked to a number of fundamental prerequisites. Ecological fruit-growing, and the applicable special requirements, are likewise taken into account in this strategy. Details are given in a separate strategy that needs to be developed further. The Fruit-Growing Expert Group of the Federal Com - mittee for Fruit and Vegetables, and the affected L\u00e4n - der, agree to submit to the BMELV, by 1 October each year, a report on the fire blight situation, the results of honey monitoring and the fire blight prevention meas - ures taken in the framework of the strategy. Based on these reports and other new information, a supervising working group compiles an overall report that is discussed with the affected Federal Ministries, the L\u00e4nder and the affected associations. 6.1.1.8 Sensitisation and education To sensitise animal owners and veterinary surgeons regarding the subject of antimicrobial resistance, it would appear sensible to use events and continuing education opportunities as a way of communicating, to as many people as possible, a basic knowledge in matters of antibi - otic use and the resultant development of resistances, as well as the latest detailed knowledge on various antibi - otics and the associated resistance phenomena. This includes basic and specialist training, but also the public portrayal and advertising of antibiotics. Consequently, highly diverse events are offered at many levels in order to draw attention to the significance and background of antimicrobial resistance. 6.1.1.8.1 Risk communication Annual reports -which are also freely available on the Internet -on the current resistance situation and on development trends are an important element of risk communication. This is defined as a continuous and inter - active process and is characterised by a participative dia - logue with various target groups. Risk communication thus goes far beyond informing all involved and interest - ed circles, beyond assessment work in the field of antimi - crobial resistance and its results. Timely information of the public regarding possible health-related risks, insights gained and working results forms the basis for this dia -logue. 6.1.1.8.2 Scientific expert events and publications The results of GERM-Vet monitoring and zoonosis moni - toring (which includes antimicrobial resistance monitor - ing for certain zoonotic agents) have so far been reported to the expert community in the form of presentations and posters at corresponding expert conferences. In addition, scientific publications are written and appear in the corre - sponding specialist journals. The data from zoonosis mon - itoring are made available to the public each year in the EU Zoonosis Report and the National Zoonosis Report. The data from GERM-Vet monitoring are moreover incorpo - rated into the GERMAP Atlas of Antimicrobial Resistance and Antibiotic Consumption, which is compiled together with contributions from experts from human medicine. Furthermore, the BVL regularly holds workshops on the methodology of MIC determination. The aforementioned international symposia have already been held at the BfR and the BVL: BfR Symposium: Towards a Risk Analysis of Antibiotic Resistance, 9-11 November 2003 BVL Symposium: Risk Management for Containing Antimicrobial Resistance, 15-16 November 2004 The \"Antimicrobial Resistance\" Working Group of the DVG has so far dealt with various topics, including the follow - ing activities, for example: definition of veterinary-specif - ic, clinical limits. Veterinary-specific clinical limits are nec - essary for making predictions about the success of treat - ment when using a particular antimicrobial active sub - stance. Accordingly, veterinary-specific clinical limits apply to one active substance, one type of animal and one particular organ system. The initial efforts of the \"Antimi - crobial Resistance\" Working Group to define veterinary- specific limits concentrated on amoxicillin in the treat - ment of respiratory tract infections in pigs. Comprehen - sive analyses of the currently available literature on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of amoxi - cillin in pigs permitted the provisional definition of limits for the categories \"susceptible\", \"intermediate\" and \"resistant\". The results obtained were discussed with the CLSI Subcommittee for susceptibility testing of veteri - nary-specific pathogens and a corresponding publication prepared, which was printed in the journal \"Veterinary Microbiology\" in January 2008. 6.1.1.9 Training and continuing education The subject of antimicrobial resistance is embedded both 6 DART in the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity | 47 in training and higher education. In addition, institutions at the federal and L\u00e4nder level offer detailed symposia and continuing education events to communicate new insights to the participants. In June 2008, for example, the State Health Office and the State Office for Consumer Pro - tection and Food Safety (LAVES) of Lower Saxony cooper - ated to organise a symposium entitled \"Zoonosis Man - agement: A Common Task for the Public Health Service and the Veterinary Sector\", where the great importance of this topic was expressed in presentations by both agen - cies and subsequent discussions. The LAVES additionally holds annual events with the municipal veterinary author - ities. Moreover, a continuing education event is held every two years with the departments of public prosecu - tion of the regional courts, which are responsible for, among other things, prosecuting violations of Section 10 of the Food and Feed Code (LFGB). This event routinely includes a presentation on the subject of antimicrobial resistance, in order to also sensitise this group of persons (with respect to the importance of prosecuting MRL value transgressions for pharmacologically active substances). Activities of the Bavarian State Office for Health and Food Safety -Academy for Health, Nutrition and Consumer Pro - tection are a further example. On 14 June 2007, it held an interdisciplinary symposium in Munich entitled \"Antimi - crobial Resistance -Relevance and Prevention\", which was organised in cooperation with the following scientific societies: Paul Ehrlich Society (PEG), Antibacterial Chemotherapy Section; German Society for Veterinary Medicine (DVG), \"Bacteriology and Mycology\" Expert Group and \"Antimicrobial Resistance\" Working Group; German Society for Hygiene and Microbiology (DGHM); Permanent Working Group \"Clinical Microbiology and Infectiology\"; Federal Association of Doctors for Microbi - ology and Infection Epidemiology (B\u00c4MI). 6.1.2 International measures T ransactions involving live animals and products of animal origin take place within the European internal market and internationally across continents. Accordingly, interna - tional measures influence the registration and use of antibiotics for veterinary medicine. The specifications for registration have been implemented nationally, and the EMEA applies harmonised Community law for central European registrations; see Chapter 6.1.1.3. 6.1.2.1 Measures at the European level In addition to EU legislation, the European Community addressed the problem of antimicrobial resistance in 2001 and 2008. In 2001, the Council adopted a conclusion deal - ing with the problem of resistance in human medicine. In 2008, numerous aspects from the veterinary sector were added, and a call on the Member States and the Commis - sion formulated to include the veterinary sector in meas - ures for minimising antimicrobial resistances. In addition, the European Community created possibilities for sup - porting research in the 6th and 7th Framework Pro - gramme. Congresses on the subject funded by the Euro - pean Community are held regularly at the European level. In the past, individual Member States established pro - grammes aimed at minimising the antimicrobial resist - ances of pathogens in animals. These programmes are usually based on reducing the use of antibiotics in live ani - mals and strict specifications for veterinary surgeons that regulate the use of antibiotics in detail. The Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products (CVMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) has established an expert group (Scientific Advisory Group on Antimicro - bials, SAGAM) that specifically addresses the subject of antimicrobial resistance in connection with central regis - trations. The SAGAM developed so-called reflection papers 52 -54 for reserve antibiotics that are also used in human medicine (fluoroquinolones and 3rd and 4th gen - eration cephalosporins). They provide recommendations regarding therapeutic use and advocate more extensive notes in the draft labelling. For example, substance class - es of this kind are only to be used if other antibiotics are not available or have proven to be ineffective. In addition, the SAGAM has elaborated a reflection paper 55 that provides for a post-marketing resistance monitoring programme as a commitment in the case of centrally reg - istered antibiotics whose resistance situation is not suffi - ciently clear. 6.1.2.1.1 Activities of the European Food Safety Authority The Panel on Biological Hazards of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) examined the question of the extent to which, from the point of view of public health, foods serve as a source of intake by humans of antimicro - bial-resistant bacteria, or of antimicrobial-resistant genes through bacteria, in order to be able to assess the ascer - tained risks and determine possible control measures for reducing susceptibility. The result is that the current extent of susceptibility to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria is difficult to determine 48 | 6 DART in the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity and that the role played by foods in the transmission of resistant genes has not been sufficiently researched. According to the information available to the EFSA, bacte - ria transmitted through foods, including the known pathogens and commensal bacteria, are demonstrating an increasing and diverse range of resistances to key antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicine, and every further increase in the resistance of bacteria con - tained in foods can have an influence on human exposure. The principles applied in avoiding and controlling the spread of pathogenic bacteria via foods also contribute to avoiding the spread of antimicrobial-resistant, pathogen - ic bacteria. The development and application of new approaches is recommended for identifying and controlling foods as carriers of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and associated genes on the basis of epidemiological studies and studies that seek to identify sources, including raw poultry, raw pork and raw beef. The EFSA is of the opinion that special, focused measures currently ought to be defined and launched throughout Europe, in order to counteract the existing and develop - ing resistance of known pathogenic bacteria to fluoro - quinolones and (3rd and 4th generation) cephalosporins that have been found in various foods and in animals in pri - mary production. In summary, it is the view of the EFSA that the control of all routes via which antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and associated genes can develop in human patients -foods being just one such source -calls for a reaction on the part of all interest groups, who must face up to their responsi - bility for avoiding both the development and the spread of antimicrobial resistance in their respective spheres of work, which also include human medicine, veterinary medicine, primary production of food-producing ani - mals, food processing and food preparation, as well as in the regulation of food safety. 6.1.2.1.2 Studies on antimicrobial resistance Throughout Europe, studies of antimicrobial resistance in animals are conducted on the basis of Directive 2003/99/EC and in accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 2160/2003 as well as the ordinances issued on the basis of this Regulation. These specifications for monitoring and recording in the framework of studies are to be imple - mented nationally (see Chapter 6.1.1.2.2). In this context, the CRL Antimicrobial Resistance has the important task of coordinating the training of the NRLs and providing the responsible laboratories with method recommendations. 6.1.2.1.3 Harmonisation of measures In relation to the studies and investigations mentioned, the decisions mentioned and training by the CRL stan - dardise the specifications for sampling and the test meth - ods themselves. Epidemiological limits according to the recommendations of the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility T esting (EUCAST) are used as the limits for assessing the resistance of zoonotic agents at the European level. Standardisation is intended to help make the collected data comparable, thus permitting comparisons between the Member States. Beyond this, the collected data form the basis for defining prevalence targets. Consequently, Community-wide measures, har - monised to the greatest possible extent, are to ensure that the occurrence of pathogens and resistances can be minimised. However, in addition to harmonisation of the measures for monitoring resistances, or of measures possibly result - ing therefrom, the elements of antibiotic registration and pharmacovigilance in veterinary medicine are also very largely harmonised throughout Europe by the specifica - tions of Directive 2001/82/EC. The specifications for newly registered antibiotics encompass extensive conditions regarding efficacy, the resistance situation and monitor - ing of resistance development, and clear regulations for use (mandatory prescription for food-producing animals). The EMEA makes a further contribution to harmonising the use of antibiotics as regards antibiotics that are cen - trally registered at this agency and can be used in all Mem - ber States. 6.1.2.2 Supranational measures Animals and goods (e.g. foods of animal origin) are traded not only within the European internal market, but also between continents. Both the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), World Health organization (WHO) and the World Organisation for Ani - mal Health (OIE) have issued scientific statements on antimicrobial resistance and developed recommenda - tions that should be observed in international trade. These recommendations are constantly being expanded and revised. 6.1.2.2.1 Specifications of the World Organisation for Ani- mal Health The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has inten - sively studied the subject of antimicrobial resistance in relation to animal health and additionally compiled a list of antibiotics of importance in veterinary medicine. This 6 DART in the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity | 49 list served the FAO/WHO and the OIE as a basis for compar - ison with the use of antibiotics in human medicine, which led to the identification of antibiotics that are used in both sectors and have the potential for cross-sector antimicro - bial resistance. The T errestrial Animal Health Code contains guidelines for the harmonisation of national antimicrobial resist - ance surveillance and monitoring programmes 98 , for the monitoring of the quantities of antimicrobials used in animal husbandry 99 , and for the responsible and prudent use of antimicrobial agents in veterinary medicine 100 . In addition, Chapter 3.9.4 of the \"T errestrial Animal Health Code\" contains specifications for risk assessment for antimicrobial resistance arising from the use of antimicro - bials in animals 101 . Consequently, a national strategy relating to the health of live animals must be geared to these specifications and give consideration to these factors. 6.1.2.2.2 Specifications of the WHO/FAO (Codex Alimentarius) The WHO and the FAO have launched a joint initiative for elaborating standards for world trade in foodstuffs with the aim of avoiding dangers for health and establishing minimum standards. The antimicrobial resistance of organisms in animals used for food production is also a topic in this context (Codex Alimentarius). The \"Code of practice to minimize and contain antimicro - bial resistance\" (CAC/RCP 61 -2005) makes provision for a number of minimum measures to be observed on an inter - disciplinary basis (registration, monitoring, training, research, etc.) in order to reduce antimicrobial resistance. A Codex Ad Hoc T ask Force of the governments on the sub - ject of antimicrobial resistance was set up at the 29th Meeting of the Codex Alimentarius Commission (2006). Within four meetings, this T ask Force has the job of elabo - rating scientifically sound instructions for assessment of the risk to human health arising from antimicrobial-resist - ant pathogens or resistance determinants in foods. The guidelines are also to encompass animal husbandry, including aquaculture. One guideline deals with recom - mendations for suitable risk management measures for reducing the risk to human health determined by assess - ment. The existing specifications of the WHO, FAO and OIE, as well as the instruments existing at the international, national and regional levels, are to be taken into account when elaborating guidelines on the methods and process of risk assessment. It was also found in this context that prudent use of antibiotics in animal husbandry serves ani - mal health and that antibiotics are indispensable for treat - ing diseased animals and animal stocks. These specifications should be taken into account with an eye to the interdependences existing in international trading. 6.2 Future national measures for minimising antimicrobial resistances The risk of transmission of antimicrobial resistances or resistance determinants is to be assessed on a scientifical - ly sound basis, and there is to be further, detailed research into the background, processes and developments that lead to resistant organisms in animals, or to transmission between animals and humans. New measures for minimis - ing the occurrence of resistances must be taken on this scientific basis. They must give consideration to safe - guarding consumer health protection (human health), minimising infectious diseases in animals, and the neces - sity of effective antibiotics in animal healthcare to restore the health of animals. They must likewise be suitable for safeguarding international trade. T o do justice to these requirements, measures are also to be taken in the spirit of the principle of prevention if there is sufficient information indicating a need for action. In this case, too, the measures taken must stand up to sci - entific verification, or be adapted accordingly. The actual situation described above, as regards meas - ures for minimising antimicrobial resistances in the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activi - ty, directly gives rise to a need for additional measures, described in more detail below. Furthermore, Chapter 6.3 presents the research and development work required to achieve the fundamental targets as described in Chapter 4.2.2. 6.2.1 Recording of the quantities of antibiotics sold Recording of the quantities of substances with antimicro - bial action sold is a fundamental criterion for assessing the antimicrobial resistance situation in veterinary medicine. To this end, there is a need to record the quantities sold (i.e. the quantities sold to veterinary surgeons by pharma -50 | 6 DART in the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity ceutical manufacturers) on a regional basis and in such detail that a regional link can be established between these quantities for the respective antibiotic in question and regional resistance data to assess the resistance risk. For this reason, the legal possibilities for recording the quantities of antibiotics sold according to Section 47 Para. 1c AMG are currently being worded in such a way that detailed recording of the quantities sold is possible. The concrete details are then to be formulated in the frame - work of an ordinance. 6.2.2 Recording of the quantities of antibiotics used The information obtained in the research project -men - tioned in Chapter 6.1.1.4.2 -on the representative record - ing of the quantities of antibiotics used is in future to be reviewed and, if appropriate, used for regulations in drug law on the obligatory recording of the quantities of antibi - otics used in food-producing animals. The data then to be expected from the recording of quantities used are to be consulted by the higher federal authorities for ongoing assessment of the risk of antimicrobial resistance develop - ment. 6.2.3 Expansion of resistance monitoring Any expansion of resistance monitoring is to build on the scientifically sound basis of the resistance situation data already available and yet to be obtained. A distinction must be made between monitoring aimed at animal health and monitoring aimed at consumer health protec - tion (human health). Based on the latest findings, a plan for monitoring antimi - crobial resistance in the food chain is elaborated annually and thus adapted to current developments. Building on extensive collections of strains at the NRL Antimicrobial Resistance, originating from samples submitted by the L\u00e4nder, not only is more extensive characterisation per - formed, but new developments are also assessed retro - spectively. Representativeness in terms of different microorganisms and influencing factors (e.g. housing forms for animal species, region, accompanying clinical and therapeutic circumstances) is increasingly being improved in this context. Direct and indirect transmission mechanisms via different exposure routes are taken into account in the interdisciplinary assessment of resistance development. The data from the studies to date (GERM-Vet and GERM- Vet-BfT) are to be taken into account for monitoring antimicrobial resistance in animals with a view to animal health, and the measures taken are to be expanded on this basis following scientific verification. Following assess - ment of the isolates collected, the monitoring of zoopath - ogenic bacteria is also to be established for non-food-pro - ducing animals. The data from both areas are then to be used for compre - hensive risk assessment, which will subsequently lead to scientifically based risk management measures in a wide variety of fields, including registration. 6.2.4 Standardisation of resistance determination The standardisation of resistance determination is closely linked to the monitoring activities and the targeted use of antibiotics for therapeutic purposes. To be able to use data from extensive monitoring for comprehensive risk assessment and to derive binding measures, the data must be comparable. Consequently, standards must be created for sampling, cultivation of the organisms and methodical determination of the resistance characteris - tics and evaluation. Susceptibility tests must adhere to internationally acknowledged method specifications. In this context, EFSA recommendations already exist, as do standards binding throughout the EU, for the field of zoonotic agents and commensal organisms (microorgan - isms that are neither harmful not useful). The EUCAST has already elaborated epidemiological limits (cut-off values) for this purpose, which permit early detection of incipient resistance development. These cut-off values can be used to examine and assess monitoring data from the human and veterinary sectors. Whether and to what extent further epidemiological limits are to be developed in indi - vidual instances, or arise retrospectively from the exami - nation and assessment of the monitoring data, is to be investigated in collaboration with the EUCAST. In the framework of therapeutic use of antibiotics, the \"Antimicrobial Resistance\" Working Group of the DVG rec - ommends adherence to the specifications of CLSI Docu - ment M31-A326 for routine veterinary medical diagnosis. However, standards of this kind should also be given a min - imum of definiteness by legislation. This could be realised through European coordination. T o start this process, fur - ther clinical limits are, for example, to be developed for the MIC values for specific antibiotics -especially also for antibiotics that have been registered for a long time. All stakeholders must be involved when defining limits. T o what extent epidemiological or clinical limits need to be 6 DART in the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity | 51 consulted for assessing resistance will depend on the intended use. On the one hand, the clinical limit plays a decisive role in interpreting the results of in vitro suscepti - bility testing for the treatment of sick animals. It gives the treating veterinary surgeon an indication of the antibac - terially active substance that is most probably therapeuti - cally effective against the disease in question. On the oth - er hand, epidemiological limits distinguish a presumably susceptible subpopulation (wild-type population) from a presumably resistant subpopulation. Based on this distri - bution, a switch of a susceptible population to a popula - tion with reduced susceptibility can be assessed, and incipient resistance development thus detected. This makes it possible to assess the threat to humans in relation to the aspect of public health. 6.2.5 Monitoring of antibiotic efficacy According to Section 63b AMG, the pharmaceutical man - ufacturer is required to submit regularly updated reports on the safety of the medicinal products it puts into circula - tion (Periodic Safety Update Report, PSUR). These reports are to be examined by the BVL. The drug risks to be taken into account in this context include the development of antimicrobial resistance (General Administrative Regula - tion on the Graduated Plan). The data presented in PSURs primarily consist of spontaneous reports of clinical obser - vations. Resistance data from curative practice are only rarely communicated via the spontaneous reporting sys - tem and do not permit assessment of the general resist - ance situation. Independently of these individual assess - ments, it is therefore necessary to perform ongoing, rep - resentative resistance monitoring in relation to the effica - cy of all antibiotics used in veterinary medicine. This mon - itoring, which is already performed to a limited extent by the BVL (see Chapter 6.2.3, third paragraph) is to be imple - mented legally, in which context it should be possible to give priority to certain substance groups. Pinpoint resist - ance monitoring is particularly to be performed for the antibiotics classified as critical in veterinary medicine. As recommended by the EMEA, these include 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, for example. The information gained from these measures is to be used for risk assessment and risk management. In the case of new registrations, the results of existing moni - toring programmes are already incorporated in the form of special notes in the draft labelling, or entail appropriate requirements if the resistance situation is unclear. A fur - ther objective is to use data obtained from monitoring for the post-marketing sector as well in the framework of prolongation and pharmacovigilance. If necessary, they are likewise to be incorporated in the draft labelling or entail appropriate, more extensive measures in the event of increased resistance development. 6.2.6 Annual antimicrobial resistance report At the moment, the resistance results of GERM-Vet (zoopathogenic agents) are published in the scientific press, while those on zoonotic agents (Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli, MRSA) are published in the frame - work of the National Zoonosis T rend Report and thus in the European Zoonosis Trend Report. Results from pharma - covigilance generally lead to measures relating to the registration of a specific product, but are not automati - cally included in the risk assessment of the overall situa - tion and the publication. The question is being examined of whether the data obtained at these different levels, and their assessment, can be made accessible to the general public in summary form. Beyond this, it is important that all data are included in the assessment of the antimicrobial resistance situation in veterinary medicine. Risk management must then be performed on the basis of scientific criteria and in compli - ance with international specifications, the interests of consumer health protection and the requirements of ani - mal health. The report should summarise all these aspects. The interface between humans and animals should be given particular consideration in this context. 6.2.7 Antibiotic guidelines The antibiotic guidelines are to be updated and regularly adapted to the state of the art in veterinary medical sci - ence. The BMELV is examining whether these guidelines should be given a more binding nature in order to achieve the objectives of the strategy (Section 56a Para. 5 AMG). It must be borne in mind that acceptance of the guidelines by the veterinary community must be ensured. 6.3 Research into antimicrobial resistance and the avoidance of 52 | 6 DART in the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity antimicrobial resistance 6.3.1 Antimicrobial resistance research activities in the portfolio of the BMELV Various institutions in the portfolio of the BMELV have been addressing issues relating to exploring antimicrobial resistance phenomena for a long time, in some cases for more than 20 years and at an internationally acknowl - edged level. These institutions include: The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), The Federal Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL), and The Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI). The BfR handles research projects on improving diagnos - tic methods and on antimicrobial resistance in connec - tion with bacteria that are of importance for human health in order to optimise routine diagnosis. Molecular biological characteristics of pathogens in relation to antimicrobial resistance are primarily explored in food- relevant bacteria (Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli, MRSA, Yersinia). They are studied in terms of their resist - ance genes and other structures of importance for the transmission of resistances from animals to humans. One focus is projects concerning resistance to fluoro - quinolones and cephalosporins, the antibiotic groups acknowledged by the WHO/FAO/OIE as being particularly relevant to human medicine. A project on recording the quantities of antibiotics used is also in progress (see Chap - ters 6.1.1.4.2 and 6.2.2). Apart from this, the BfR plays a key role in the monitoring tasks relating to antimicrobial resistance in pathogens of significance for human health. This monitoring covers the national data on antimicrobial resistances from the food chain and from specific funda - mental pan-European studies. The BfR operates the NRL Antimicrobial Resistances for the food chain. On special issues for clarifying the MRSA situation in Ger - many, the BfR manages and coordinates studies for recording the occurrence of MRSA (including L\u00e4nder par - ticipation). Epidemiological and diagnostic questions are also to be answered, and risk assessments performed. Some of these questions are also part of studies conduct - ed by third parties. The BVL performs studies on antimicrobial resistance trends in zoopathogenic agents in live animals (food-pro - ducing animals and \"hobby\" animals). The findings are used for assessing the registration of antibiotics. The FLI deals with issues relating to resistance genes and resistance mechanisms, generally at the molecular level, and draws up recommendations for daily clinical practice. Examples include the following: Elaboration of the methodology for determining the susceptibility of bacterial pathogens of relevance in veterinary medicine on the basis of specific examples (Haemophilus parasuis (pigs), Riemerella anatipestifer (poultry), Rhodococcus equi (horses)), Examination of the molecular foundations of antimi - crobial resistance (resistance genes, resistance mecha - nisms and resistance mutations) in economically signif - Actinobacillus, Rhodococcus, Riemer-ella, Bordetella), Performance of preliminary research into resistance to new, relatively new or future veterinary antibiotics (externally funded research), Performance of selected pathogen/active-substance resistance projects of major economic, scientific and medical (both human and veterinary medical) impor - tance glycopeptide, pleuromutilin resistances), Characterisation of mobile genetic elements in the transfer of resistance characteristics (host cell spec - trum, co-localisation of resistance, co-selection poten - tial). The FLI will additionally clarify certain questions relating to the molecular characteristics of MRSA. This is intended to provide information on the risk potential and the potential capabilities of the commensal organisms of the mucosa. 6.3.2 Research and development requirement The previous measures described indicate a substantial research and development requirement that can essen - tially be divided into two areas. First, there is a need to clarify questions relating to the origin, spread and trans - mission of resistances and resistance genes, including the diagnostic methods for determining an existing infection. T o create alternatives to the use of antibiotics in animals, there is also a substantial need for research into, and pro - motion of, the development of vaccines and similar prod - ucts that enable animal immune systems to control infec -6 DART in the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity | 53 tions without the use of antibiotics, or to create condi - tions that prevent infections from the outset (hygiene). 6.3.2.1 Antimicrobial resistance characteristics and mechanisms So that assessment of the risk of transmission of antimicro - bial resistances or resistance determinants can be put on a sound, scientific footing, and the background, process - es and developments leading to resistant organisms in animals, or to transmission between animals and humans, can be explored, the BMELV is of the opinion that there is a need for research in the framework of consumer health protection. The resistance genes and mechanisms of many pathogens of relevance in veterinary medicine are unknown. Clarifying these aspects can be seen as part of the preliminary research into resistances to new, future veterinary antibiotics. Although knowledge exists regard - ing a number of resistance development mechanisms and the fact that animals and products of animal origin are contaminated with resistant organisms or resistance determinants, there is an urgent need to clarify how resistant pathogens -e.g. multiresistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) -get into certain habitats in the animal organism, or how and why they develop there (e.g. in the intestinal tract of cattle). In only few instances do we know how these pathogens acquire diverse resistance mechanisms, pass them on, and whether they then also reach humans, be it by direct transmission of the pathogens or by food- induced transmission. Another of the questions addition - ally to be clarified is whether the potential properties are actually used and whether further properties -e.g. viru - lence properties -can possibly be acquired, above and beyond the resistance characteristics. When applying the measures for minimising antimicro - bial resistance in the field, there is the problem that every resistance test to date is dependent on isolation of the organisms. In acute cases, antibiotics can only be given to an animal following clinical diagnosis. Before administer - ing the first dose, a sample can be taken to isolate and cul - tivate the organism, so that the resistance characteristics can subsequently be determined. However, the results are usually only available several days later, meaning that the veterinary surgeon initially has to select and use an antibiotic on the basis of his knowledge and experience with the clinical picture, although the resistance of the causal organism or other commensal organisms has not yet been determined. This makes it difficult not only to carefully select an antibiotic, but also to apply the above- mentioned guidelines of the German Veterinary Associa - tion in practice. In this context, it must be examined whether rapid tests can be developed that permit estima -tion of the resistance situation, both on-site and when selecting an antibiotic and further therapeutic steps. The BMELV is of the opinion that collaboration with the human medicine sector is necessary in these fields. 6.3.2.2 Promotion of the development of alternatives to the use of antibiotics In veterinary medicine, antibiotics are approved as veteri - nary medicinal products for therapy or for metaphylaxis f) . Group and herd treatment of infectious diseases is often unavoidable in agricultural livestock. However, in addi - tion to the occurrence of the pathogens, there are other factors of decisive importance in this context. Infectious diseases are also a management problem where, on the one hand, husbandry or hygiene measures are not per - formed effectively and, on the other hand, possibilities for prophylactic treatment by vaccination are either not con - sistently utilised or do not exist. If no vaccines are avail - able, the development of new vaccines can help to reme - dy the situation. One sustainable example is the use of vaccines in aquacul - ture in Norway. In this case, introduction of the vaccina - tion of salmon against vibriosis and furunculosis led to a decline of more than 80 % in the use of antibiotics, while the population doubled (see Fig. 3). T ransferring an effect of this kind to other fields of animal husbandry is to be the objective of promoting vaccine f) Exception: prophylaxis for drying off dairy cows or in the perioperative field, for example. 54 | 6 DART in the field of animal husbandry, the food chain and veterinary activity development. Not only vaccines aimed directly at bacte - ria have the effect of reducing the quantities of antibiotics used, but also vaccines that prevent infections (e.g. viral infections, infestation with parasites, etc.) potentially leading to bacterial secondary infections. Developments must aim to enable the establishment of vaccines in the everyday practice of routine animal husbandry. Product developments of this kind contribute directly to con - sumer health protection. In addition to promoting vaccines, the question must also be examined of the extent to which other alternatives, such as immunomodulators or so-called competitive exclusion preparations or other substances that strength - en the immune system, can contribute to reducing the quantities of antibiotics used in animal husbandry. Management in animal husbandry influences the health of the animals and the quantities of antibiotics used, and is thus a significant focus for research. The question must be examined as to whether and to what extent the occur - rence of infectious diseases resulting in use of antibiotics can be reduced by optimising management measures in animal husbandry (e.g. hygiene, feeding, animal trans - port). The BMELV sees an urgent need for research and develop - ment activities in connection with these alternatives. 6.3.2.3 Promotion of research into the optimisation of antibiotic and vaccine use, and into the optimisation of monitoring T o achieve optimum results when using antibiotics them - selves, or existing alternatives, it may be necessary to pro - mote research geared to their optimisation, so that there is the possibility of using available means to reduce the use of antibiotics, and thus the selection pressure on exist - ing bacteria. Monitoring measures should be optimised in such a way that the spread of a resistance can be detected at an early stage and the data support modelling of future spread. Of decisive importance in this respect is the interdisciplinary networking of knowledge at all levels of the food chain and in humans. In particular, the objective must be to identify factors that favour a spread and to estimate the efficacy of countermeasures in advance.

the consumption of reserve antibiotics is high in a European comparison 1.3.3 Prevention and control of antimicrobial resistance Antimicrobial resistance can be prevented and controlled on various levels and in various areas, because numerous factors can contribute to antimicrobial resistance. On the level of prescribing antibiotics, physicians must be thor - oughly familiar with the methods for diagnosing infec - tious diseases, the effects and dosages of antibiotics, the development of resistance and the local resistance situa - tion, in order to make a correct diagnosis and select the right antibiotic. Recommendations on diagnostics and therapy can help prescribing physicians make a diagnosis and select an antibiotic. Generally acknowledged national recommen - dations are required as a basis for elaborating local rec - ommendations. These local recommendations take the local situation into account and frequently exist only in large hospitals in Germany. Furthermore, reommenda - tions on hygiene and avoiding infections help to prevent the transmission and spread of (multi)resistant infective agents. To promote the exchange of knowledge and improve communication between the various stakeholders in the health sector, networks and quality circles have been established in Germany, some of which also support the prevention and control of antimicrobial resistance, al- though this is frequently not their primary objective. Public relations campaigns on the prudent use of antibi - otics serve to educate both the general public and profes - sional groups. The section below describes activities in Germany for pre -venting and controlling antimicrobial resistance in the following areas: recommendations, training, further edu - cation and continuing education, public relations cam - paigns and networks. 1.3.3.1 Recommendations Recommendations and guidelines are decision-making aids and pointers for diagnosing and treating infections. Only in justified cases should a physician deviate from these recommendations. Guidelines are developed with the goal of improving the quality of care and treatment and increasing patient safety. The recommendations described below are divided into the areas of diagnostics, therapy, hygiene and quality assurance. As a topic here, hygiene only includes the rec - ommendations for preventing and controlling MRSA in hospitals and other medical facilities. All other recom - men-dations on hygiene and infection prevention issued by the Commission on Hospital Hygiene and Infectious Disease Prevention (KRINKO) are primarily for ensuring compliance with general hygiene measures and less for preventing and controlling antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, they are not included in this section. Because numerous recommendations exist in these areas, as elaborated by various organisations and institutions in Germany, this section presents only a selection of recom - mendations, mostly those relating to national and local treatment recommendations. 1.3.3.1.1 Diagnostics S3 guidelines concerning epidemiology, diagnostics, antimicrobial treatment and management of adult patients with community acquired, deep respiratory tract infections 73 Responsible: PEG, DGP , DGI, CAPNETZ Competence Network Objective: T o establish standards for diagnosis and therapy, and pro - mote the efficient use of antibiotics in treating communi - ty acquired pneumonia and deep respiratory tract infec - tions Special features: Comprehensive guidelines covering all aspects of diagno - sis and antimicrobial treatment;

provides breakpoint tables for antibiotics and web-based software for collecting frequency distributions on the sus - ceptibility of wild-type populations, and relevant antibi - otic and pathogen combinations; subcommittees for the resistance testing of fungi and for interpreting resistance tests Limitations: Breakpoints are not yet available for all significant antibi - otics and pathogens 1.3.3.1.2 Therapy National recommendations on antibiotic therapy 122,123 Responsible: Scientific societies Objective: T o aid in establishing the indication for antibiotic therapy and selecting the antibiotic Special features: A high degree of implementation can be achieved by bas - ing local recommendations on the national recommen - dations Limitations: Germany has no generally acknowledged, national rec - ommendations on antibiotic therapy; the actual applica - tion of existing recommendations in Germany is unknown and has yet to be examined Local recommendations on antibiotic therapy 76 Responsible: Drug commissions of clinics and hospitals, e.g. Drug Com - mission of Freiburg University Medical Centre Objective: T o aid in critically establishing the indication for antibiotic therapy and selecting the antibiotic Special features: Recommendations drafted in collaboration with hospital directors ensure support and approval during the process of elaborating and applying the recommendations; local recommendations can be adapted to the local situation; increased patient safety; use of a uniform antibiotics regi - men cuts costs in purchasing; uniform, indication-based definition of antibiotic therapy Limitations: Therapy geared to local recommendations is not always possible; the actual application of ex-isting recommenda - tions in Germany is unknown and has yet to be examined 1.3.3.1.3 Hygiene Recommendations for preventing and controlling methi- cillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains in hospitals and medical facilties 108 Responsible: KRINKO Objective: T o prevent and control methicillin-resistant Staphylococ - cus aureus strains in hospitals and other medical facilities Special features: KRINKO and its recommendations have a legal basis in Sec - tion 23 Para. 2 IfSG Limitations: Implementation of the recommendations in medical facilities, and monitoring of application by the Public Health Service (\u00d6GD), is frequently inadequate 1.3.3.1.4 Quality assurance Quality standards in the microbiological diagnosis of infectious diseases (MIQ) 86 Responsible: DGHM Objective: To optimise the diagnosis and therapy of infectious dis - eases Special features: Clear guidelines for a systematic approach, from a tenta - tive clinical diagnosis, right to definitive diagnosis and therapy;

offers internal and external quality assurance and mandatory testing in the field of laboratory diagnostics in accordance with the current guidelines of the German Medical Association Limitations: No legal basis 1.3.3.2 Basic training, specialist training and continuing education of medical occupational groups Numerous (academic) occupations requiring formal training, as well as specialist training programmes, can be assigned to the category \"medical occupational groups\". Thorough knowledge of the antimicrobial resistance problem is important for all of them. In this context, physicians (and also dentists) who pre - scribe antibiotics must acquire different knowledge through their basic training, specialist training and con - tinuing education than, for example, medical or dental employees working in a private practice. The topic of antimicrobial resistance must be sufficiently incorporated in basic training, specialist training and con - tinuing education programmes for physicians to enable the correct diagnosis of infectious diseases and antibiotic therapy in line with the indications. In addition, physicians and all other medical occupational groups must have sound knowledge of the risks associated with the devel - opment of antimicrobial resistance, of general hygiene measures, infection prevention and specifically of the transmission of multiresistant infective agents. On account of the central role physicians play, the follow - ing section covers basic training, specialist training and continuing education for this group only. Basic medical training The fundamentals of basic medical training are defined in Germany's Regulation on the Licensing of Doctors 20 . Basic medical training encompasses a six-year course of study, including practical training (pre-registration year) of 48 weeks. Furthermore, medical students must complete training in first aid, a nursing internship of three months, a medical clerkship of four months and take a two-part medical examination. The regulations governing licensing to practice medicine are standardised nationwide in the Federal Regulation on Doctors and the Regulation on the Licensing of Doctors. The Federal Ministry of Health is responsible for the con - tent of both of these regulations. While the Regulation on the Licensing of Doctors names only the mandatory medical disciplines, the individual universities issue specific guidelines for fulfilling all degree requirements. Specialist medical training Specialist medical training involves acquiring further medical knowledge or skills after having completed basic medical training and receiving a license to practice. Specialist training is a defined process in terms of duration and content. It enables a physician to qualify as a specialist in individual disciplines and subsequently to specialise in key fields or in a supplementary specialist training pro - gramme. The provisions regarding specialist medical training are defined in the individual L\u00e4nder laws and in the autonomous articles of the State Chambers of Physicians. Consequently, they are under the jurisdiction of the 17 Appendix | 67 State Chambers of Physicians. T o support these, the German Medical Association elabo - rates model Regulations on Specialist Training 17 for the State Chambers of Physicians, which are intended only as recommendations. However, the specialist training regu - lations of the L\u00e4nder are frequently very similar to the model regulations issued by the German Medical Associa - tion. Continuing medical education All physicians are required to update and consolidate their professional skills by continuing to learn while work - ing in their occupation. The fundamental requirement to take part in continuing education is anchored in the Pro - fessional Code for Physicians. SHI-accredited physicians and specialists in hospitals are additionally required by law to furnish proof of continuing medical education, as laid down in Book V of the German Social Security Code. The purpose of continuing education is to impart the knowledge of medicine and medical technology required to maintain and expand competence. Recommendations on the content of continuing medical education are formulated by the German Medical Associ - ation as follows: \"Subject-specific, interdisciplinary and general knowledge, as well as training in practical skills. T opics that serve to improve social skills, communication and management skills, or knowledge of quality manage - ment and evidence-based medicine. Information relating to the health sector, as well as economic and legal topics, all of which promote occupational training for physicians, may also be included.\" 16 A continuing education certificate is awarded when a physician has completed continuing education pro - grammes, within a given time period, that together add up to a specific number of points. 1.3.3.3 Networks According to experts, the increasing problem of antimi - crobial resistance is further aggravated by the lack of coordination between the stakeholders in the health sec - tor. For example, following discharge from hospital, nei - ther a patient's general practitioner, nor the patient him - self or his relatives, are informed about an infection with a multiresistant pathogen. As a result, hygiene measures required to prevent the transmission of (multi)resistant infective agents are not carried out and the pathogen continues to spread. The problem is further aggravated because, in some cases, coverage of the costs associated with implementing hygiene measures outside the inpa - tient sector is either not provided, or is unclear. Therefore, experts recommend establishing regional net - works, which they believe can make an important contri - bution to preventing and controlling multiresistant pathogens. This has already been demonstrated by the established MRSA-net network, and is supported by a cor - responding resolution of the Conference of Ministers Responsible for Health. EUREGIO Project MRSA-net 31,60,92 Responsible: Institute ology Laboratory, Twente/Enschede, NL; State Institute for the Public Health Service, North Faculty of Behavioural Sciences, Twente University/ Enschede, NL Objective: To develop a cross-border strategy for preventing and controlling MRSA in the M\u00a7nsterland region of Germany and T wente/Enschede, The Netherlands, by establishing a network of all stakeholders in the health sector Special features: Networking of all stakeholders in the health sector; dis - cussion, training and specialist medical training on the MRSA problem within the network; network coordinated by the public health office; cross-border cooperation and exchange of knowledge; establishment of an early-warn - ing system for detecting unusual increases in the occur - rence of specific MRSA clones; introduction of health insurance billing codes for MRSA screening and treatment in the outpatient sector Limitations: Restricted to the region; a sustainable structure is at risk because of limited-term financing of the project by the European Commission Current data: Not yet available in published form Resolution of the 79th Conference of Ministers Responsi- ble for Health (GMK), 30.6.2006 3 Responsible: L\u00e4nder Ministries of Health Objective: To establish networks in all regions to reduce MRSA infections and their spread, particularly between hospi - tals, care homes and outpatient care facilities 68 | Appendix Special features: All stakeholders in the health sector (e.g. hospitals, physi - cians in private practice, clinical microbiologists, hygiene professionals, etc.) are to participate in the network; the network is to be coordinated by the Public Health Service; the Euregio project MRSA-net is to serve as a model for the networks to be established; the responsible ministers and senators in the L\u00e4nder health systems gave their joint sup - port to establishing these networks in the Resolution of the 79th GMK Limitations: The Public Health Service must be strengthened in order to implement the resolution; financing of the networks still unclear Current data: State of implementation unknown Genome research on pathogenic microorganisms - PathogenoMik Network coordinator: University of W\u00a7rzburg Objective: T o develop strategies for controlling bacterial infectious diseases by improving diagnosis and the typing of infec - tive agents, and by close cooperation with companies Special features: The BMBF's GenoMik programme has been in existence since 2001; research focuses on the pathogenic bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Helicobacter pylori; development of DNA microarrays for tuberculosis pathogens, with which a genome comparison can be made between the tuberculosis pathogen and other mycobacteria; study of Helicobacter pylori in 27 groups of people of different ethnic background and geographical origin Current data: Detailed analysis of the Helicobacter pylori genome showed that the bacteria can be assigned to seven groups and subgroups. These, in turn, can be traced to four Heli - cobacter populations that originated in Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and East Asia. The Helicobacter types encountered in Europe today apparently result from the merging of two populations from the Middle East and Central Asia. These findings are extremely important for treatment, because genetic differences can be responsi - ble for varying degrees of aggressiveness, and influence the efficiency of antibiotics Outlook: After the first two phases of funding, the network is now to be continued within the framework of the GenoMikPlus programme, which aims to step up implementation of the research results in improved diagnosis and treatment options for bacterial diseases PathogenoMik-Plus Competence centres: Universities of Bielefeld, G\u00f6ttingen and W\u00a7rzburg Objective: To continue research projects from the PathogenoMik programme that are of commercial interest and to be fur - ther developed for the market Special features: Alliance between companies that represent the econom - ic interest in microbial genome research and already are involved in diverse genome research networks; establish - ment of an industrial platform to serve as a hub of commu - nication on microbial genome research in Germany, not only for interested companies, but also for research organisations and political representatives Outlook: Plans to register as an association; funding from 2006 to 2009 encompasses a budget of some \u20ac 20 million 1.3.3.4 Public relations campaigns Other European countries are increasingly educating the general public and medical occupational groups on aspects of antibiotic treatment and antimicrobial resist - ance by way of public relations campaigns, particularly countries with high antibiotic consumption in the outpa - tient sector, e.g. France and Belgium. For example, aware - ness of the effects of antibiotics was increased by advertis - ing spots on television and radio. In Germany, only few public relations campaigns exist at present in the field of antimicrobial resistance. Cam - paigns to inform physicians, like those in France that tar - get physicians in private practice, do not exist in Germany. The most important are listed in the section below. Antimicrobial resistance - An explosive issue 81 Responsible: Paul Ehrlich Society for Chemotherapy, German Society for Infectious Diseases, German Society for Hygiene and Microbiology Objective: T o educate and sensitise the general public with regard to Appendix | 69 the danger of antimicrobial resistance Special features: Internet campaign for the general public on the effect of antibiotics, special aspects of taking antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance; campaign office provides a hot - line for, and information on, antibiotics and resistance development Limitations: General public has taken little notice of the campaign Initiative on Antibiotic Use: \"Targeted is Safe\" (Gezielt ist sicher) Responsible: Expert group for infectious diseases, pneumology and intensive therapy Objective: To educate professional circles and the general public regarding the targeted use of antibiotics Special features: Internet information campaign on the action of antibi - otics, taking antibiotics, antimicrobial resistance and the diagnosis of bacterial infections Limitations: General public has taken little notice of the campaign 1.4 Antimicrobial resistance in an international context 1.4.1 European Commission 27,28,97 In 2001, the European Commission published a strategy for countering antimicrobial resistance in the Member States. The strategy includes 15 actions in the areas of sur - veillance, prevention, research and development, and international cooperation. One important element of the strategy is the Recommendation on the prudent use of antimicrobials in human medicine (2002/77/EC). In this Recommendation, the European Commission calls on the Member States to introduce specific strategies for the prudent use of antimicrobial agents so as to contain anti- microbial resistance. These strategies should pursue the following primary objectives: a) Establishment or expansion of systems for monitoring antimicrobial resistance and the use of antibiotics b) Introduction of measures to control and prevent antimicrobial resistance, to promote the prudent use of antimicrobial agents and to contribute to contain - ing infectious diseases c) Promotion of education and training of healthcare pro - fessionals regarding the problem of antimicrobial resistance, and information of the general public on how important it is to use antimicrobial agents pru - dently. To underline the significance of the issue and support implementation of the 2003 Recommendations of the European Council on the prudent use of antimicrobial agents in human medicine, a Council Conclusion on Antimicrobial Resistance was adopted during the Sloven - ian Presidency of the EU Council in June 2008. 46 In addition to the Recommendations of the European Commission on the prudent use of antimicrobial agents in human medicine, projects and measures are also being funded as part of the European Framework Programmes (currently the 7th Framework Programme, FP7). The pro - gramme was launched in 2007 and will run until 2013. FP7 does not focus on the area of antimicrobial resistance. 1.4.2 European Academy Science Advisory Council (EASAC) The EASAC is an advisory body of the European Commis - sion, managed by the national science academies of the EU Member States. The EASAC has in recent years issued several statements on the problems of antimicrobial resistance and nosocomial infections. 1.4.3 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Con - trol (ECDC) 39 -41 Antimicrobial resistance is a high-priority issue for the ECDC. The first Annual Epidemiological Report on Com - municable Diseases in Europe, published by the ECDC in June 2007, rates increasing antimicrobial resistance as one of the greatest dangers facing the EU health sector. In its Recommendation on the prudent use of antimicro - bial agents in human medicine (2002/77/EC), the Euro - pean Commission calls on the ECDC to support the Com - mission in future in elaborating recommendations and reports on implementation of EU Recommendations by the Member States. The ECDC primarily carries out the following activities in the area of antimicrobial resistance to help Member 70 | Appendix States in this field: Coordination of surveillance networks, Standardisation of methods for susceptibility testing, Elaboration of European Recommendations on pre - venting and controlling infections, Coordination of activities in the Member States, Development of an Internet site with information on activities in the Member States, and Inspection and evaluation of activities in the Member States. Despite the high priority of this issue at the ECDC, no apparent progress has been made with regard to imple - menting these activities. 1.4.4 World Health Organization (WHO) 128 The WHO published its Global Strategy for Containment of Antimicrobial Resistance in 2001. It describes antimi - crobial resistance as a global problem affecting all nations around the world. In the strategy, the WHO recommends interventions in the following areas: patients and prescribing physicians in private practice, hospitals, use in food-producing animals, health policy and health systems. These interventions are aimed at slowing the development and reducing the spread of antimicrobial resistance. In a critical statement, the World Health Assembly (WHA) complains that the WHO Strategy for Containment of Antimicrobial Resistance has been insufficiently imple - mented to date. The WHA states that a globally integrated programme involving all health systems is necessary to promote efficient antibiotic use and thereby contain resistance. 1.5 Players in the field of antimicrobial resis - tance This section provides a brief introduction to players who are involved in the field of antimicrobial resistance in Ger - many and who could potentially be interested in partici - pating in the implementation of the strategy. They were active participants in the consultation phase. The players have a central role in elaborating, revising and imple - menting the strategy. While the players are assigned con - crete actions in the section on national targets (Chapter 6.2), this section describes the key tasks of these players in the field of antimicrobial resistance. Aktionsb\u00fcndnis Patientensicherheit e. V. (APS - German Coalition for Patient Safety) The German Coalition for Patient Safety works to promote safe healthcare in Germany and is committed to research - ing, developing and spreading the use of methods suit - able for reaching this goal. The work agenda of the German Coalition for Patient Safe - ty encompasses a number of specific projects, which are addressed by its multidisciplinary working groups. The working groups meet regularly and publish their results in the form of recommendations, which are available free of charge to all organisations in the German health sector. The German Coalition for Patient Safety cooperates with professional associations, scientific societies, research institutes, health insurance funds, self-administration institutions and patient organisations. It receives financial support from the Ministry of Health. International cooper - ation exists with sister organisations for patient safety. These cooperative efforts serve to promote scientific exchange and to prepare and implement actions and campaigns to improve patient safety in Germany. Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wissenschaftlichen Medizinischen Fachgesellschaften e. V. (AWMF - Association of Scientific Medical Societies in Germany) The members of the Association of Scientific Medical Soci - eties in Germany currently comprise 152 scientific soci - eties in all fields of medicine. The AWMF confers on fundamental and interdisciplinary issues and tasks, elaborates recommendations and reso - lutions, and actively seeks support for them from institu - tions involved in the field, particularly in the political sec - tor. Apart from tackling issues of internal cooperation, which is becoming ever more urgent in view of increasing specialisation, the AWMF thus aims to more aggressively communicate the interests of medical science to external groups. The AWMF acts by direct mandate of its member societies or through their delegates. When the AWMF addresses current problems on its own initiative, it seeks to ensure agreement with its member societies. Arbeitsgruppe Infektionsschutz (AGI - Infection Protection Working Group) Appendix | 71 The Infection Protection Working Group is a specialised section of the Working Group of the Supreme Health Authorities of the Federal L\u00e4nder (AOLG). The AOLG and the AGI monitor and evaluate healthcare policy issues from a scientific point of view. The heads of the health de- partments of all the L\u00e4nder and representatives of the Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) meet twice a year in the AOLG. The AOLG handles direct preparatory work for the Meet - ing of the Heads of Administration of the Ministries and Senate Administrations, which in turn prepares the Con - ferences of Ministers Responsible for Health. The Conference of Ministers Responsible for Health is an important body, providing a forum for an exchange of sci - entific and political opinion between the Ministers and Senators of Health of the L\u00e4nder and of the Federal Gov - ernment. It generally meets once a year and addresses all health policy issues. In addition to questions of structur - ing and financing statutory health insurance, the confer - ence particularly addresses matters of preventive health - care and safeguarding health, consumer health protec - tion, environmental health protection, healthcare profes - sions, drugs and addiction and European health policy. Because the L\u00e4nder have their own competences in health policy, and can even influence federal projects through the Bundesrat, the Conference of Ministers Responsible for Health plays a very important role in this policy field. Arzneimittelkommission der Deutschen \u00c4rzteschaft (AKd\u00c4 - Drug Commission of the German Medical Asso - ciation) The Drug Commission of the German Medical Association has the task of giving the German Medical Association independent advice on scientific issues relating to drugs. Furthermore, the Drug Commission is intended to sup - port the Council of the German Medical Association in forming opinions on drug policy issues, and to formulate position statements on fundamental and individual issues submitted to it by the Council of the German Medical Association. Committee on Health of the German Bundestag The Committee on Health's sphere of responsibility essen - tially encompasses the portfolio of the corresponding Federal Ministry and the tasks resulting for the Federal Ministry of Health. It primarily addresses the following areas: Health insurance, Healthcare provision, Long-term care insurance, Drugs, the pharmacy sector, medical products, General preventive healthcare, occupations, commu - nicable diseases, AIDS, genetic engineering, Prevention. Every year, the Committee deliberates on numerous bills and motions relating to the subject areas listed above. In this connection, it regularly conducts public hearings and expert discussions to obtain a complete and largely inde - pendent picture of the subject under discussion. For this purpose, the Committee invites experts, proposed by the parliamentary groups, from all societal groups signifi - cantly affected by a given issue. Berufsverband Deutscher An\u00e4sthesisten e. V. (BDA -Association of German Anaesthetists) The Association of German Anaesthetists is a forum for anaesthesiologists and physicians currently receiving specialist medical training in the field of anaesthesiology. According to its Articles of Association, the tasks of the BDA are: T o represent this speciality within the medical commu - nity, the chambers of physicians and the Regional Asso - ciations of SHI-Accredited Physicians, T o provide members with information on professional issues, T o participate in all public -law tasks relating to anaes - thesiology, T o cooperate with other professional associations, T o safeguard the sphere of responsibility of anaesthesi - ology, intensive care medicine, emergency medicine and pain therapy. Professional specialist training and continuing educa - tion in agreement with the German Society for Anaes - thesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00a7r An\u00e4sthesiologie und Intensivmedizin e. V.). The association further offers a number of services for its members, particularly in the area of insurance and insur - ance advice. In accordance with Germany's federal struc - ture, the BDA is divided into 17 L\u00e4nder associations. Berufsverband Deutscher Hygieniker (BDH - German Association of Hygiene Specialists) The tasks of the German Association of Hygiene Special - ists include, in particular, informing the general public about the importance of the field of hygiene and environmental medicine, and distinguishing the profes - sion of hygiene and environmental medicine specialist 72 | Appendix from other similar professional fields by elaborating clear definitions of training and education requirements, pro - viding political representation and harmonising the pro - fessional profile within the EU. Bundesamt f\u00fcr Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit (BVL - Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety) The Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safe - ty is an independent higher federal authority dealing with market authorisation in the area of food safety and con - sumer protection in the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (BMELV). The BVL has a broad range of responsibilities, particularly: Reviewing applications for the registration of feed additives and coordinating the National Food Safety Management Programme, Registering plant protection agents and veterinary medicinal products, and cooperating on EU registra - tion procedures in Germany, Ensuring the safety of registered veterinary medicinal products, Studying antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from food-producing animals and developing measures to avoid resistance, and Granting permits for releasing genetically modified organisms (GMO) for scientific experiments. Bundes\u00e4rztekammer (B\u00c4K - German Medical Association) The German Medical Association is the head organisation in the self-government system of the medical profession. It represents the professional policy interests of physi - cians in the Federal Republic of Germany. The responsibili - ties of the B\u00c4K include: Mediating an exchange of opinions and experience between the State Chambers of Physicians, Maintaining contacts with the Federal Government, the Bundesrat and the political parties, Communicating the standpoints of the medical profes - sion on matters of health policy and medicine, Promoting continuing medical education, Promoting quality assurance, and Regulating, in particular, the Professional code (regulating ethical and professional obligations of physicians among themselves and vis-\u00e0- vis patients), and Regulations on Specialist Training (defining the con - tent, duration and objectives of specialist training and the specialist designations). Bundesgesch\u00e4ftsstelle Qualit\u00e4tssicherung (BQS - German National Institute for Quality Meas-urement in Health Care) The German National Institute for Quality Measurement in Health Care has, since 2001, been managing and coordi - nating the development of content for, and the organisa - tional implementation of, external, comparative quality assurance activities in German hospitals as per Section 137 of Book V of the German Social Security Code. The mission of the BQS is to provide scientifically based statements on the quality of medical and nursing care. For example, in order to quantify, maintain and improve the quality of hospital care, the BQS has access to data on about 20 percent of all inpatient treatment cases in Ger - man hospitals. This source of data supports analyses and evaluations that can be put to diverse uses. Through the Act to Strengthen Competition in the SHI Sys - tem, the Federal Joint Committee is now obliged in future to assign quality assurance tasks, previously given to the German National Institute for Quality Measurement in Health Care, to a new, independent institution (to be selected in a competitive process). This institution is scheduled to take up its work in 2009. Bundesinstitut f\u00a7r Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte (BfArM - Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices) The Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices is an independent higher federal authority in the portfolio of the BMG. One of the primary tasks of the BfArM is to deal with mar - keting authorisations, and the extension of authorisa - tions, for finished drugs on the basis of the German Drug Law. It reviews the proof provided of a product's efficacy, safety and suitable pharmaceutical quality. When it comes to antibiotics, the most critical aspect is assessing efficacy and safety. The BfArM's Pharmacovigilance Department is additionally responsible for the safety of drugs after marketing authorisation. Reports on adverse drug reactions are collected and analysed in order to initi - ate steps towards risk minimisation as necessary. Bundesinstitut f\u00fcr Risikobewertung (BfR - Federal Institute for Risk Assessment) Appendix | 73 As a higher federal authority in the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (BMELV), the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment is responsible for the safety of foods, substances and prod - ucts, and thus for consumer protection. The BfR elaborates health assessments and action options for government agencies responsible for risk manage - ment. The work results and recommendations of the BfR serve all interested groups as key decision-making aids for various programmes. With its science-based risk assess - ments, the BfR plays a leading role in consumer health pro - tection in Germany and abroad. In addition, it has the statutory task of providing informa - tion on potential, identified and assessed risks that foods, substances and products pose for consumers. The entire assessment process is presented in such a way that it is easily understood by the general public. By way of com - prehensive and comprehensible risk communication, the BfR makes science visible and useful to consumers. Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Bildung und Forschung (BMBF - Federal Ministry of Education and Research) The BMBF activities in health research are characterised by a comprehensive approach, ranging from studying the cause of disease and preventive healthcare, to structural changes in research, all the way to improved cooperation between the economy and science. Researching the caus - es and development of diseases, instead of simply control - ling symptoms, is a key objective of BMBF funding. In this context, it is important for physicians, researchers, hospi - tals and private practices in various special disciplines to collaborate on research. Furthermore, another objective is to exploit existing or underdeveloped potentials in bio - medical research for the purpose of effective diagnosis and therapy. For example, functional human genome research, in particular, is expected to deliver valuable find - ings for controlling diseases. Current and planned funding programmes are coordinat - ed and networked with the relevant action plans of the European Union's 6th and 7th Research Framework Pro - grammes. In addition, the 6th and 7th EU Research Frame - work Programmes offer an opportunity to establish topi - cally focused networks with representatives of research promotion and programme development (European Research Area Networks, ERA-NET). The goal of these net - works is to efficiently harmonise the respective national programmes and implement a joint European pro - gramme, initiated by the national funding organisations. Over the last three years (2005-2007), the Federal Min - istry of Education and Research has invested over \u20ac 320 million in health research, in addition to over \u20ac 175 million for implementing the \"National Genome Research Net - work: Controlling Disease through Genome Research\". A total of \u20ac 141.6 million is to be invested in 2008 to fund projects in the programme, \"Health Research: Scientific Research for People\". The BMBF has been funding infection research since 1981. The objective of funding is to pool existing research potentials and to promote targeted development in such a way that scientific progress can benefit patients as quickly as possible. Scientific results are to be implement - ed directly in therapeutic and diagnostic measures. At present, some \u20ac 20 million a year are invested to promote projects. The following key areas are funded: Clinical Infectiology: to support clinical research into infectious diseases in Germany and build a bridge between research and clinical practice. Product-Oriented Vaccine Development: for the tar - geted improvement of candidate vaccines. Medical Competence Networks on Infectious and Inflammatory Diseases: including hepatitis, sepsis, HIV/AIDS and community acquired pneumonia; to improve the transfer of results from basic research to clinical research and finally to patient care. Research Networks on Susceptibility and Resistance to Infections: to identify the significance of related mech - anisms in order to develop new approaches to disease- based research and new treatment strategies. Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (zoonoses): to strengthen cooperation between human and veterinary medicine, in particular. TSE (transmissible spongiform encephalopathies): research and development to improve diagnostic methods and treatment options. National Genome Research Network (NGFN): with the disease-oriented \"Infections and Inflammations\" genome network. Pathogenomics: microorgan - isms. GenoMik and GenoMik-Plus programme: exploiting the potential of microorganisms through global, genome- strategies. Bundesministerium f\u00a7r Ern\u00e4hrung, Landwirtschaft -Federal Ministry of Food, 74 | Appendix Agriculture and Consumer Protection) The Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection is responsible for ensuring food safety, while safeguarding economic sustainability for producers in the agricultural sector and maintaining ecologically and socially intact rural regions. The Ministry's portfolio includes seven Research Centres, the BfR and the BVL. The primary tasks of the Research Centres is to elaborate sci - ence-based decision-making aids for food, agriculture and consumer protection policy for the Federal Govern - ment. At the same time, their findings benefit both the common good and consumers. Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit (BMG - Federal Ministry of Health) The Federal Ministry of Health is responsible for a variety of policy fields, whereby its activities focus on the drafting of bills of law, ordinances and administrative regulations. One of its key tasks is maintaining, securing and further developing the capacity of statutory health insurance and long-term care insurance. The reform of the health sector is one of the Ministry's most important tasks. The objective is to further develop the quality of the health sector, bolster the interests of patients, ensure cost-efficiency and stabilise contribution rates. Some of the Ministry's priority areas in the health sector are prevention, health protection, disease control and biomedicine. By means of the Protection Against Infec - tion Act, prevention, counselling and personal responsi - bility in the prevention of infection are clearly emphasised and the public healthcare system strengthened. The Transplantation Act, the Protection of Embryos Act and the Stem Cell Act establish the regulatory framework for these important fields of medicine. The Federal Ministry of Health also draws up the frame - work provisions governing the manufacture, clinical trial, marketing authorisation, distribution channels and sur - veillance of medicinal products and medical devices, so as to fulfil the existing high requirements in terms of quality, effectiveness and safety. A core long-term task of the Min - istry and its subordinate authorities is the safety of biolog - ical medicinal products, such as blood products. In addi - tion, the Federal Ministry of Health supports research and facilitates the creation of new care provision struc -tures. This applies, for example, in the case of mental health, assistance to the chronically ill, child health and the coun - selling and care of persons infected with HIV or suffering from AIDS. In order to continually improve the level of knowledge with respect to the healthcare system, the necessary information is collated within the framework of Germany's health monitoring system. The prevention of drug and addiction risks forms part of disease control and, as such, constitutes a central area of this Ministry's sphere of responsibility. The profession-related legislation governing licensing to practise those medical and health professions which are regulated by federal law - including the corresponding training regulations - the aim of which is to ensure the quality of training in the health professions and therefore, also, the quality of medical and nursing care, similarly falls within the scope of the Ministry's respon-sibilities. Alongside national health policy, European and interna - tional health policy also form part of the Federal Ministry's portfolio. Globalisation, tourist traffic, the opening towards our neighbours in Eastern Europe, all lead to a sit - uation where new risks and dangers prematurely thought to be overcome, have to be countered jointly with part - ners wherever they emerge. Also assigned to the Ministry are the Federal Govern - ment's Drug Commissioner and the Federal Government Commissioner for Patients' Affairs. Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Umweltschutz, Naturschutz Ministry for the Envi- ronment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety) The Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conser - vation and Nuclear Safety centrally coordinates environ - mental policy on behalf of the German Federal Govern - ment. The Basic Law gives rise to three different levels of legisla - tive competence in international and EU affairs for the Federal Government and thus for the BMU: For environmental protection treaties with other states or international organisations, For the areas of water management, nature protection, rural conservation and regional planning, For the areas of waste management, air pollution con - trol, noise control, nuclear energy, radiation protec - tion and chemical safety, subject to competitive legislative competence. Bundestier\u00e4rztekammer (BTK - German Veterinary Asso - ciation) The German Veterinary Association is the nationwide rep -Appendix | 75 resentative of the members of all veterinary professions. The tasks of the BTK are: T o ensure a continuous exchange of experience among the State Chambers of Veterinaries, jointly coordinate objectives and activities, promote the most uniform possible regulation of professional codes governing veterinaries and the principles of practicing veterinary medicine, T o advise the State Chambers of Veterinaries, T o represent the interests of veterinaries vis-\u00e0-vis legis - lators, government administrative bodies and the gen - eral public, T o promote continuing education (particularly by fund - ing the Academy of Continuing Education in Veterinary Medicine), as well as basic and specialist training, To represent the professional interests of veterinaries on the national and international level. Bundesverband der Arzneimittel-Hersteller e. V.

The association is committed to the interests of pharmaceutical manufacturers, active - ly helping to shape health policy issues and closely follow - ing relevant legislative processes. It is responsible on the one hand for formulating position statements in the inter - ests of the member companies, and on the other hand for supporting the political decision-making process in view of its overall political obligation, this resulting from its fac - tual and technical competence in questions relating to the pharmaceuticals and the health system, the aim being to bring about decisions that are effective and a benefit to consumers. Therefore, technical discussions in prepara - tion for draft legislation make up a great part of the associ - ation's work. Another natural focus of the association's work is to pro - vide member companies with comprehensive advice and rapid information. Apart from the political activities of the BAH, the association's activities are characterised by basic scientific work in the pharmaceutical sector in a broad range of areas. Information on pharmaceuticals is collect - ed and analysed in order to formulate position statements on occurrences in the pharmaceutical sector. Bundesverband der \u00c4rzte des \u00f6ffentlichen Gesundheits - dienstes (BV\u00d6GD - Federal Association of Public Health Service Physicians) The Federal Association of Public Health Service Physi - cians is the umbrella organisation of all the State Associa - tions of Public Health Service Physicians represented in the L\u00e4nder.
