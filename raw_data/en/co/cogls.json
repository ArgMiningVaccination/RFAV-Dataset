Coronaviruses as a group have been known to science since the late 1930's and are recognized to cause 15-30% of all winter \"common colds\". SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is much more serious than the common cold because it is a new strain for which most people have no immune defense. COVID-19 infections cause a range of illness from mild, which can be treated at home, to severe enough that hospitalization is required. In most people symptoms are similar to the flu or common cold, however some people can have severe symptoms requiring hospitalization or even resulting in death. Individuals 65 years or older and those with [underlying health conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html) are at higher risk from COVID-19. As of March 2023, [data for Oregon](https://public.tableau.com/shared/PH7KXCG7C?:toolbar=n&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) shows over 960,000 cases of COVID-19, and over 9,300 Oregonians whose death was attributed to COVID-19. If you are at higher risk, the Benton County Health Department recommends speaking to your medical provider about creating a COVID plan, which should cover your personal risk, prevention strategies, and treatment options in case you do get sick. COVID-19 Vaccination The COVID-19 vaccine offers excellent protection from severe illness and hospitalization. The updated, bivalent vaccine was authorized by the Food and Drug Administration in September of 2022, and teaches your body how to recognize the original and the omicron strain of the virus. Currently, everyone 6 months and older is eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Everyone 5 years or older who has not received a bivalent booster is eligible for one. For children younger than 5 the schedule varies. For more details, visit the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html?s_cid=11747:covid%20vaccine%20schedule:sem.ga:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN:FY22). The COVID-19 vaccine is available from most medical providers and other locations where vaccines are available. Many locations require appointments - reach out to the provider to make one. If you are looking for a COVID-19 vaccine, there are a few places you can check: - Your regular medical provider. - Supporting medical providers, like [SamCare Express](https://www.samhealth.org/find-a-location/s/samcare-express-corvallis). - Local pharmacies, including pharmacy counters inside of grocery stores. If these options do not work for you please contact our health department by phone at 541-766-6835. COVID-19 Testing At-home testing kits are available over-the-counter at many pharmacies and retail locations.

Laboratory testing is also available through dedicated COVID-19 testing outlets and medical providers.
