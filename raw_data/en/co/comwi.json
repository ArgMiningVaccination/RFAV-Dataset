The SDDTAC and our community partners continue to see the devastating impacts of the pandemic, including the exacerbation of food insecurity and many other existing health disparities specifically for communities of color and our most vulnerable populations . COVID -19 and its impacts remain a focal point in our conversation to make funding recommendations that benefit our community during these unprecedented times and hono r the intent of the tax set forth by voters of Proposition V. For Fiscal Year 2022 -2023, SDDTAC recommends investing sugary drinks distributor tax (SDDT) dollars to issues communities care most about including: Equitable access to healthy food for low -income people and students Food security Access to safe and affordable physical activity Oral health A built environment that ensures access to the aforementioned, including o An awareness/educational outreach campaign, and o a one -time infrastructure and capacity building gran ts for community - based food organizations to prepare them to access Medi -Cal funding for meals and groceries, and other nutrition services rendered . More details of our recommendations and supporting evidence can be found in the annual report attached to this letter. Highlights of our annual report and updates from this past year include: Our Evaluation Report features how funds were used in Fiscal Y ear 2020 - 2021 to support healthy people and health places within San Francisco This past year, we welcome several new committee members: o Maysha Bell (Seat 2: Health Equity, Co -Chair of Community Input Subcommittee 202 1-present ) o o Abby Cabrera (Seat 4: Research/Medical Co-Chair of Data & Evaluation Subcommittee 2021 -present ) o Diana Lau (Seat 5: Research/Medical Institutions) o Kiana Sezawar (Seat 6: Youth Seat, -present ) o Veronica Shepard (Seat Food Access/Security) o Dianna Cavagnaro (Seat 15: SFUSD Parent Advisory Council) o Maureen Guerrero (Seat 16: Children 0 -5 Years Old) As new co -chairs of the com mittee, we thank Mayor London Breed, San Francisco Board of Supervisors and San Francisco Residents, as well as the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) Staff, our Research Evaluators (Raimi & Associates), our SDDTAC colleagues, and the community voices we hear for their tireless efforts and commitment to this important work. Together, we ca n use the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax to truly benefit those San Francisco's communities who are most impacted by the marketing and consumption of sugary drinks. Thank you.

ARTICLE 8: Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Ordinance (San Francisco Business and Tax Regulations Code) D. ARTICLE XXXIII: Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Advisory Committee (San Francisco Administrative Code) E. Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Advisory Committee Bylaws 2 I. BACKGROUND a. Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Legislation In November 2016, San Francisco voters passed Proposition V. Proposition V established a one penny per ounce fee on the initial distribution of a bottled sugar- sweetened beverage, syrup, or powder, within the City and County of San Francisco. The Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax (SDDT) is a general excise tax on the privilege of conducting business within the City and County of San Francisco. It is not a sales tax or use tax or other excise tax on the sale, consumption, or use of sugar -sweetened beverages. The funds collected from this tax are to be deposited in the General Fund. The legislation defines a sugary drink, or sugary -sweetened beverage (SSB), as follows: A sugar -sweetened beverage (SSB) means any non-alcoholic beverage intended for human consumption that contains caloric sweetener and contains 25 or more calories per 12 fluid ounces of beverage, including but not limited to all drinks and beverages commonly referred to or any other similar names. The passage of Proposition V established two pieces of law: the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax in Business and Tax Regulations Code and the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Advisory Committee (referred to in this report as \"Committee\") in the City's Administrative Code. The ordinance stated that the Committee shall consist of 16 voting members, who are appointed by either the Board of Supervisors or certain City departments. The powers and duties of the Committee are to make recommendations to the Mayor and the Board of Supervisors on the effectiveness of the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax and to submit a report that evaluates the impact of the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax on beverage prices, consumer purchasing behavior, and public health. The Committee is to also provide recommendations regarding the potential establishment and/or funding of programs to reduce the consumption of sugar -sweetened beverages in San Francisco. In May 2018, the SF Department of Public Health was requested to assume staffing of the Committee. The Mayor's Office formalized the change in administrative oversight of the Committee from the City Administrator's Office to Department of Public Health through a transfer of function of the Executive Branch pursuant to Sec. 4.132 of the City Charter. 3 Unless the Board of Supervisors by ordinance extends the term of the Committee, it shall expire by operation of law, and the Committee shall terminate, on December 31, 2028. b. Report Requirements and Process Starting in 2018, by March 1, of each year, the Committee shall submit to the Board of Supervisors and the Mayor a report that evaluates the impact of the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax on beverage prices, consumer purchasing behavior, and public health. The Committee in their report shall make recommendations regarding the potential establishment and/or funding of programs to reduce the consumption of sugary drinks in San Francisco. Within 10 days after the submission of the report, the Department of Public Health (per change referenced above) shall submit to the Board of Supervisors a proposed resolution for the Board to receive the report. c. Relationship Between Sugary Drink Consumption, Health, and Health Equity A large body of evidence exists indicating that sugary drink consumption increases risk for cavities, overweight/obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and heart disease.i,ii,iii,iv,v Although sugary drinks can contain hundreds of calories in a serving, they do not signal \"fullness\" to the brain and thus facilitate overconsumption.vi Sugary drinks are the leading source of sugar in the American diet, contributing 36% of the added sugar Americans consume.vii Numerous organizations and agencies, including the American Heart Association, American Diabetes Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, American Medical Association, and the Centers for Disease Control, recommend limiting intake of added sugar and sugary drinks to improve health. Studies show that sugary drinks flood the liver with high amounts of sugar in a short amount of time and that this \"sugar rush\" over time leads to fat deposits and metabolic disturbances that are associated with the development of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other serious health problems.viii Of note, every additional sugary drink consumed daily can increase a child's risk for obesity by 60%ix and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 26%.x Diseases connected to sugary drinks are also found to disproportionately impact ethnic minority and low- income communities - the very communities that are found to consume higher amounts of sugary drinks. Diabetes hospitalizations are approximately three times as high in low-income communities as compared with higher income communities. African American death rates from diabetes are two times 4 higher than San Francisco's overall rate. In San Francisco, approximately 42% of adults are estimated to be obese or overweight, including 66% of Latinx and 73% of African Americans. With respect to oral health, the data indicate that Asian and Pacific Islander children suffer from cavities at a higher rate than other populations; but Latinx and African American children also have a higher prevalence than the average for cavities. The Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax is intended to discourage the distribution and consumption of sugary drinks in San Francisco by taxing their distribution. Preliminary analysis of sales data indicates that the SDDT is successful in decreasing consumption: purchases of sugar -sweetened beverages at supermarkets in San Francisco decreased by more than 50% in the two years following the implementation of the tax xiii. Mexico, where an average of 163 liters of sugary drinks are consumed per person each year, enacted an excise tax on sugary drinks in 2014, with the result that the purchase of taxed sugary drinks declined by 12% generally and by 17% among low-income Mexicans by December 2014. The Mexico data indicate that, when people cut back on sugary drinks, to a significant extent they choose lower -caloric or non- caloric alternatives. Studies have projected that a 10% reduction in sugary drink consumption in Mexico would result in about 189,300 fewer incident type 2 diabetes cases, 20,400 fewer incident strokes and myocardial infarctions, and 18,900 fewer deaths occurring from 2013 to 2022. This modeling predicts the sugary drinks tax could save Mexico $983 million international dollars.xi Following the implementation of Berkeley, California's sugary drink tax, the first in the nation, there was a 50% decline in sugary drink consumption among diverse adults over the first 3 years of the tax.xii Modeling suggests that a national sugary drink tax that reduced consumption by just 20% would avert 101,000 disability -adjusted life-years; gain 871,000 quality -adjusted life-years; and result in $23.6 billion in healthcare cost savings over just 5 years. The tax is further estimated to generate $12.5 billion in annual revenue. This body of research demonstrates that taxation can provide a powerful incentive for individuals to reduce their consumption of sugary drinks, which in turn can reduce the burden of chronic disease . d. Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Advisory Committee The Committee shall consist of the following 16 voting members: Seats 1, 2, and 3 shall be held by representatives of nonprofit organizations that advocate for health equity in communities that are disproportionately impacted by diseases related to the consumption of Sugar -Sweetened Beverages, as defined in Business and Tax Regulations Code Section 552, appointed by the Board of Supervisors.

Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Revenue & Revenue Projections The City and County of San Francisco operates on a July -June fiscal year (FY). Each year the Mayor and Board of Supervisors pass a rolling, two-year budget, with the second year becoming the first year of the next budget cycle; similarly, the Committee makes rolling, two-year recommendations. SDDT Revenues The Treasurer and Tax Collector collects the revenue and the Controller's office reports the revenues as indicated in the \"Actual\" column below (to track revenues go to www.sfdph.org/sddtac ). The Controller's office also projects expected revenue, shown in the \"Projected\" column in the table below. Tax collection began January 1, 2018. Between January 2018 - February 22, 2022 a total of $53,494,811 has been collected. SDDT Revenue Projected Actual FY 2017- 2018 Actual figure represents 6 months, Jan-Jun2018 $8,000,000 $7,911,731 FY 2018- 2019 represents updated figure from $16,000,000 $16,097,908 FY 2019 $53,494,811 The amount available to the SDDTAC to recommend is determined after voter -mandated set asides (about 22%), additionally, the Board of Supervisors appropriated $1.2 million of the $11.6 million in ongoing \"Healthy Addbacks\" during the FY2017- 18 budget process. In January 2022, the Controller's Office projected that the SDDTAC make recommendations for $10,620,000 for both FY2022- 23 and FY2023- 24. 8 II. Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Advisory Committee Recommendations a. SDDT Advisory Committee Process The Committee meets monthly with the Department of Public Health (DPH) serving as backbone staff. In addition to the full monthly Committee meetings, many Committee members participated in one or two subcommittees. The three subcommittees continued their work from the previous year: Data and Evidence, Community Input, and Infrastructure. Each subcommittee gathered input from experts, stakeholders, community groups, and sugary drink tax advisors from other cities. The full Committee also heard community input at meetings and each subcommittee was encouraged to incorporate public feedback in its recommendations. The Committee's recommendations were informed by scientific data and evidence; community input via community focus groups, as well as learnings from other jurisdictions that have implemented similar taxes. The Co-Chairs also conducted meetings with the Mayor's Office to describe the process for developing recommendations and to describe the Committee's strategies in more depth. The Committee is tasked with making two-year budget recommendations to coincide with the City's two-year budget cycle every year. The Committee expects new information will emerge during the course of the year from funded organizations, ongoing community input, new data and evidence, etc. that will inform potential changes to its secon d year budget recommendations. For example, this year the Committee is making recommendations for expenditures in FY22 -23 and FY23 -24. The Committee will re-evaluate its FY22 -23 recommendations at the end of 2022 and may make changes, if deemed appropriate, for its final FY23 -24 recommendations in early 2023. Given the Committee's legislative mandate to evaluate the impact of the SDDT and Mayor London Breed's commitment to accountability (\"Make every dollar count\") of public dollars, the Committee continues to recommend that revenue generated from the SDDT be indicated in such a way that City Departments know that they have received funding that was generated from SDDT revenue. Such notation makes it possible for the committee to fulfill its legislative mandate with respect to documenting the impact the SDDT is having in San Francisco. The Committee voted on February 16, 2022, to make the funding recommendations for FY2022 -23 and FY2023 -24 as described in the recommendations section. 9 Subcommittee Reports Data and Evidence Subcommittee 1. Voted on a new subcommittee co -chair 10 2. Updated a work plan that identifies subcommittee tasks in alignment with the goals of the SDDTAC. 3. Invited former SDDTAC co- chairs to speak on values of SDDT and how the subcommittee's work supports SDDTAC's efforts. 4. Provided critical feedback on SDDT Evaluation Review - Raimi & Associates shared logic model: goals, strategies, outcomes, impact and metrics regarding the evaluation plan. 5. Approved Raimi & Associates evaluation report FY 2020 -2021 6. D&E discussed focusing on COVID 19 expanding SDDT to go beyond emergency food, especially since COVID may be here for some time. Possibly shift priorities to COVID response with the same identified communities that suffer from diet- related health disparities. These communities ar e still being disproportionately burdened. 7. Discussed keeping a database of current and relevant evidence based literature including blogs, op eds, etc. 8. Discussion on potential data and evidence content for SDDTAC newsletter. 9. Continued to discuss, from SD DTAC request for reviewing data and evidence on pipeline pathway development for young people into health career pathways, hearing from local experts and reviewing literature on the subject to make recommendations on SDDTAC support for health career pathways 10. The Data and Evidence committee supports local economic development and states that it is okay to broaden funded activities and what and how investments are being made for now. This enables further collaborative learning and an opportunity to design how our soda tax efforts could do better toward creating healthier communities for low -income and populations of color, who are hardest hit by COVID and soda industry marketing and the health impacts of their products. 11. Reviewed and commented on FY 21 -22 & FY 22- 23 budget and made recommendations for the SDDTAC 12. Members agreed for FY 22 -23 and FY 23- 24 budget recommendations allocated with recommended percentages. 11 Community Input Subcommittee 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 12 6. 7. 8. 13 14 Infrastructure Subcommittee 1. a. b. c. d. e. f. g. h. 2. 3. 4. 5. 15 March 2021 - cancelled April 6, 2021 May 4, 2021 June 1, 2021 July 13, 2021 - meeting cancelled August 3, 2021 September 7, 2021 October 5, 2021 November 2, 2021 December 7, 2021 January 4, 2022 February 1, 2022 16 17 b.

COMMUNITY -BASED GRANTS COMMUNITY - BASED GRANTS Health education, food security, physical activity City Departments should contract directly with CBOs through an RFP process managed through the Community Health Equity and Promotion (CHEP) Branch of the Department of Public Health . CBG should support community -based programs and services that address the health inequities of those most targeted by the beverage industry. Funding should go to Community Based Organizations (CBOs) and Faith Based Organizations (FBOs) for the following strategies: Health Education activities including, chronic disease prevention, healthy eating and active living, tap water promotion, oral/dental health; Physical Activity opportunities, including a) Dance and movement, sports, yoga, walking groups, biking, etc.; b) Changes to the built environment (i.e. sidewalks, streets, parks, buildings, etc.) or safety of the built environment that facilitates increased physical activity and active transportation). 3. Food Security, including a) Community -based pantries, community -based hot meals, community kitchens and community home delivery services; b) Increased financial resources (i.e. wages, income, government nutrition supplements, vouchers, etc.); c) Changes to the built environment that facilitate food security; d) Pursuit of institutional or local policies that facilitate food security; and e) Food A ccess, including community -based food systems, approaches, community - based pantries, community -based hot meals, community kitchens and community home delivery services, etc. 4) Water Promotion, such as support for Spa Water Supplies, station maintenance an d beautification, refillable water bottles to distribute to communities, water testing. 5) Community Based Participatory Research. Food As Medicine MediCal Waiver Program One time infrastructure and capacity building grants for community based food orga nizations to prepare them to contract with health plans, use medical coding and billing, share confidential patient information, and other areas needed to access Medi -Cal funding for meals and groceries and nutrition services rendered CBOs working with SFUSD Recommend 3% of all CBO funding should go towards CBOs implementing programs/initiatives that take place in school settings. Funding to issue grants to CBOs should follow the guidelines above. SFUSD School Food, Nutrition Education To improve the quality and appeal of school meals and support nutrition education to increase participation in school meal programs (for example: cooking and serving equipment, staff professional development, and innovative procurement and menu strategies to increase freshly prepared food). Funding will target schools with the largest populations of high-risk students that are disproportionately targeted by the sugary drinks industry. Student Led Action Support student led efforts to decrease consumption of sugary drinks and increase awareness of sugary drinks consumption among students, with focus on schools with the largest populations of high-risk students that are disproportionately targeted by the sugary drinks industry. SFUSD should provide to SDDTAC a proposal of how funding will be spent through student led action. Funding to also support adequate staffing for implementation. College Scholarship s for Priority Populations Educational investments across lifespan. Scholarships and other supports in higher education in health field for Priority Populations. 20 FOOD ACCESS Healthy Food Purchasing Supplement* Support programs that increase financial resources to purchase healthy food such as vouchers and food purchasing incentives. These funds should be RFP'd out to CBOs and FBOs . Funding should support programs and services that increase financial resources to purchase healthy food; access to healthy fruits and vegetables while minimizing processed foods for high- risk communities; foods that are affordable and convenient; and programs that support the consumption of healthy foods including the ability to prepare and store meals and the knowledge of basic nutrition, food safety and cooking. Priority programs should incorporate a community -based food security perspective and have demonstrated increased ability of food insecure residents to purchase, access, and consume consumption of healthy, fresh, low-to-no cost and culturally appropriate foods, including but not limited to food vouchers/ incentives, transportation and delivery and prepared foods. Healthy Retail SF Supporting small business to increase healthy food access in high risk, impacted communities and neighborhoods by: 1) supporting business operations; 2) promoting community engagement; and 3) improving the retail environment.

This coalition will mobilize action on policy, systems, and environmental (PSE) changes to increase breastfeeding rates and duration, leveraging community strengths and tackling structural barriers to reduce inequities to breastfeeding support. This would include funding for backbone support to: engage community stakeholders in a strategic planning and engagement process to develop a framework for short and long term goals embedded in principles of equity; help align breastfeeding support services in San Francisco including hospital, outpatient, and community based services to improve access to breastfeeding support; and provide technical assistance to partnering agencies (such as child care centers and businesses with less than 50 employees) to operationalize and implement breastfeeding friendly policies and practices. Funding will also support community -based organizations that are already supporting breastfeeding. DPH INFRASTR UCTURE Marketing/ Promotion/ Outreach Funds to DPH/CBOs/Private media firms to support media and communications that include 1) grassroots, community -driven awareness campaigns about the intent of the SDDT and the impact of the allocated funds; 2) city -wide communications campaign highlighting the impact and importance of the SDDT; 3) communications materials for merchants; and 4) and communicate the harmful impact of sugary drinks and healthy alternatives.

Impact on Beverage Prices and Consumer Purchasing Behavior & Public Health a. IRI Beverage Sales Data The EVIDENCE project, a n interdisciplinary academic research team , shared the following findings from their analysis of retail sales data from San Francisco, Oakland, and Richmond, California between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019. There was a statistically significant decrease in the volume of sugar -sweetened beverage s purchased in San Francisco, compared to Richmond, California, in the 2 years after the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax (SDDT) was implemented. Purchases of sugar - sweetened beverages at supermarkets in San Francisco decreased by more than 50 %. There were no statistically significant changes in purchases of untaxed beverages or sweet snacks following implementation of the SDDT. Additionally, there was no statistically significant change in purchases of sugary drinks in neighboring areas (within 3 miles of San Francisco), compared with neighboring areas of Richmond, after the SDDT was implemented . This suggests that SF residents are not crossing into Daly City or South San Francisco to purchase sugary drinks. Because there has been a decrease in sugary drink sales in San Francisco, the tax collected from sugary drink distributors in San Francisco decreased from prior years, totaling $10.4 million in 2020 -2021. This downward turn may also have been impacted by COVID -19. This research was conducte d by Justin White and Dean Schillinger at the University of California, San Francisco, Sofia Villas -Boas and Kristine Madsen at the University of California, Berkeley, Scott Kaplan at the U.S. Naval Academy, and Sanjay Basu at Waymark Health. These finding s have been submitted to a journal for publication and were in the peer -review process when this report was finalized in February 2022. b. Public Health Data Fall 2020 Data Report Public health data change minimally from year to year, thus, we refer readers to the Fall 2019 Data Report which can be found at https://sf.gov/public -body/sugary - drinks -distributor -tax-advisory -committee . The SDDT epidemiologist was activated as a disaster service worker to support COVID -19 response, therefore no other data were updated . Assuming COVID -19 continues to decline, DPH expects to release a comprehensive 23 SDDT data report in Summer 2022. 24 IV. Impact of SDDT a. SDDT Funding Distribution SDDT funds support a wide range of programs, services and organizations . The charts below help describe which city agencies receive funds and what types of programs and services are being provided. The Appendices include more information about funded organizations and their programs ( SDDT Funded Initiatives and Annual Evaluation Report) Any SDDT revenue that is allocated is first allocated to a city department.

SDDT FY 20 -21 Evaluation Report San Francisco Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax (SDDT) EVALUATION REPORT 2020 -2021 PREPARED BY: Letter of Introduction DEAR MAYOR LONDON BREED, SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, AND SAN FRANCISCO RESIDENTS, We are excited to share the evaluation findings from work supported by the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax (SDDT) during fiscal year 2020-2021. We are proud of what we are seeing, especially given the ongoing challenges that all SDDT-funded organizations and agencies have continued to work through as the COVID-19 pandemic, health guidance, and economic and health impacts have evolved. This evaluation report presents the following key findings. The passage of Proposition V made San Francisco one of the first cities in the United States to approve a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages. Since then, the SDDT ordinance and creation of the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Advisory Committee (SDDTAC) has informed best and promising practices nationally, especially related to how this tax revenue is spent. San Francisco SDDTAC members include people who are part of the populations and neighborhoods in San Francisco which are most targeted by the beverage industry and most harmed by diet-related chronic diseases and who work in and with these communities. This has meant that the SDDTAC's funding recommendations have been shaped by people with diverse lived experiences as well as public health evidence. Furthermore, the SDDTAC makes funding recommendations to the Mayor but does not make any funding decisions -- which we believe is an important distinction. One way in which the San Francisco SDDTAC has influenced the work supported with SDDT funds is by identifying values to guide funding recommendations -- most importantly by prioritizing work with and for the communities in San Francisco which are most targeted by beverage industry marketing and impacted by other structural inequities. The values identified in the SDDTAC Strategic Plan have been incorporated into the SDDT evaluation plan, which has encouraged all organizations and agencies supported with SDDT funds to bring the SDDT values alive in their work. During the 2020-2021 fiscal year, we witnessed the COVID-19 pandemic continue to exacerbate long-term structural inequities among low-income communities and communities of color. These communities have been disproportionately harmed by the economic and health impacts of the pandemic--and continue to be. Since 2018, SDDT funding has been used to support community organizations and government agencies focused on addressing needs for historically disenfranchised communities in San Francisco. During this past year, SDDT funding has been more important than ever as these trusted community programs have provided food and other resources; shared information about COVID-19 guidance, testing, and vaccines; and responded to their communities' emerging needs. Finally, we continue to track key outcomes identified in the San Francisco SDDTAC Strategic Plan. We are especially excited that this report documents some of the positive outcomes of work supported with SDDT funds, as well as of the impact that the tax has had on the purchase and consumption of sugary drinks in San Francisco. Sincerely, Marna Armstead Co-Chair Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Advisory CommiteeMichelle Kim Co-Chair Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Advisory Commitee 2 Contents Introduction 4 Finding 1 20 The San Francisco SDDT Ordinance and SDDTAC have been identified as effective in addressing health disparities resulting from the consumption of sugar- sweetened beverages as well as addressing long- standing inequities. Finding 2 36 The San Francisco SDDT values have ensured that SDDT funded programming focus on and effectively engage communities most burdened by inequities. Finding 3 76 Organizations and agencies used SDDT funding to help those communities experiencing the worst health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic meet basic needs while simultaneously supporting the structural changes necessary to promote equity. Finding 4 100 SDDT funded entities are beginning to achieve desired outcomes. Recommendations 116 3 SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORTOverview SAN FRANCISCO'S SUGARY DRINKS DISTRIBUTOR TAX (SDDT) In 2016, San Francisco voters took a stand against the soda industry and passed a tax on the distribution of sugar-sweetened beverages, known as the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax (SDDT) or \"soda tax\". Rather than taxing consumers, the tax imposes a one-cent per fluid ounce tax on the distribution of sugar-sweetened beverages, syrups, and powders within the City and County of San Francisco. In addition to the tax, the legislation also established the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Advisory Committee (SDDTAC) made up 16 diverse voting members. The SDDTAC is charged with 1) making recommendations to the Mayor and Board of Supervisors about how to distribute the funds generated by the tax; and 2) evaluating the effectiveness of those programs and agencies that received SDDT funding. 4 In November 2016, San Francisco voters passed the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax (SDDT) - more commonly known as the SF Soda Tax, which established a 1 cent per ounce fee on the initial distribution of drinks with added sugar. This chart shows how the tax revenue flows into the city and to the communities most targeted by the sugary drinks industry marketing and advertising tactics. 1. Sugary Drink Distributors are Taxed The SF Soda Tax is not a sales tax. Distributors are responsible for paying the tax. Merchants may choose to pass the cost of the tax along to consumers.2. Revenue is Collected The SF Soda Tax collects about $15-16 million each year. The revenue goes into the City's General Fund. About 22% is set aside for specific, voter- approved projects. The Tax Advisory Committee makes recommendations to the mayor on how to spend the remaining 78%. 3. Tax Committee Recommends Investments The Committee talks to community members to learn about how the tax revenue could benefit people,especially low- income people and people of color who are most targeted by the beverage industry's advertising. The Committee then submits their funding recommendations to the Mayor.4. City Budget Process Finalizes Investments The Mayor submits a budget proposal to the Board of Supervisors, including recommendations for the SF Soda Tax funds. The Board of Supervisors votes on the budget and the Mayor signs it. 5. SF Soda Tax Funds Programs! SF Soda Tax funds go to City departments who either implement programs and services directly or issue grants to community-based organizations to fund their important work.

Community-led work should be led by communities that are disproportionately impacted by marketing for and consumption of sugary beverages from the beverage industry and diet-sensitive chronic diseases (i.e., SDDTAC's priority populations), and culturally relevant work should be responsive to these communities and populations. This can be achieved by investing in priority communities and ensuring funded work is culturally responsive, linguistically relevant, and trauma informed. Building strong collaborations and partnerships to increase capacity and effectiveness. Funding should support existing and new community-based partnerships and collaborations that align resources to increase capacity, effectiveness and impact of strategies, programs and services. Eliminating structural inequities and achieving equity. Equity (including health equity and racial equity) means that everyone has a fair and just chance to reach their full potential and be healthy. The root causes of structural inequities and health disparities (e.g., systems of oppression, intentionally and unintentionally/implicitly biased policies, resource allocation) need to be addressed in order to achieve equity. This is done by mitigating health harms and holding the soda industry accountable. Prioritizing results and long-term impacts. Funding should support policy, systems, and environmental changes that include programming and go beyond programming, to change the structures in which we work, live, learn, and play. Adopting a Policy, Systems & Environmental (PSE) change approach can help create sustainable, comprehensive measures to improve community health, as well as enrich and expand the reach of current health preventive efforts and engage diverse stakeholders with the goal of improving health. Farming Hope Training Garden 6 Findings need to be largerPriority Populations The San Francisco Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Advisory Committee (SDDTAC) identified communities which are targeted by the soda industry, which consume sugary drinks at high rates, and which experience disproportionate levels of diet-sensitive chronic diseases as populations which should be prioritized in SDDT funding recommendations. Specifically, the SDDTAC identified: Low-income San Franciscans Community members who identify as any of the following: Black/African American Pacific Islander Native American Latinx Asian Children, youth, and young adults 0-24 years old Although these communities are distinct, there is also considerable overlap between them, with community members who belong to more than one of these communities experiencing intersecting and cumulative inequities. Diabetes hospitalizations are approximately three times as high in low- income communities compared to higher income communities. Black/ African American death rates from diabetes are two times higher than San Francisco's overall rate. Asian and Pacific Islander children suffer from cavities at a higher rate than other populations; but Latinx and Black/African American children also have a higher prevalence than the average for cavities. SDDT funds have been used to support programs within both community-based organizations and government agencies that focus on the neighborhoods and populations most impacted by diet-related chronic diseases and other health inequities. Diet-sensitive chronic diseases include tooth decay, cavities, obesity, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure), and cardiovascular disease.

This is the second evaluation report and presents evaluation findings for the programs and agencies that received SDDT funding for Fiscal Year 2020/2021. The report aligns with the 2020-2025 SDDTAC Strategic Plan (for more information, please see www.sfdph.org/sddtac ). Data Sources This report presents both quantitative and qualitative evaluation data provided from SDDT funded city agencies and community-based grantees, as well as primary data collected through interviews with SDDTAC members. Overview of Portsmouth Square, Chinatown 14 Report Findings The San Francisco SDDT Ordinance and SDDTAC have been identified as effective in addressing health disparities resulting from the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages as well as addressing long- standing inequities.1 3 4 2 The San Francisco SDDT values have ensured that SDDT funded programming focus on and effectively engage communities most burdened by inequities.Organizations and agencies used SDDT funding to help those communities experiencing the worst health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic meet basic needs while simultaneously supporting the structural changes necessary to promote equity. SDDT funded entities are beginning to achieve desired outcomes. 15 SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORTTaxes on Sugar- Sweetened Beverages in the United States: Recent LearningsThroughout the US, sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) tax revenues are being invested in alignment with the intent of the legislation which established these taxes. Researchers looked at investments from the sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) excise tax in 7 cities across the US (including San Francisco) and found that current SSB investments are in alignment with the intended and promised use of funds. In the 7 US cities (including San Francisco), the resources have been allocated to fund early childhood development, community infrastructure improvements, youth and workforce development, access to healthy foods and beverages, support for physical activity, interventions supporting overall well being, heath and nutrition education, chronic- disease prevention and management programs, and programs working to reduce SSB consumption.1 Having a clear understanding of the purpose and use of SSB taxes can decrease consumption of sugary beverages and increase support for SSB excise taxes. When community members have a clear understanding of the purpose and use of SSB taxes, they are more likely to decrease consumption of sugary beverages in addition to support addressing inequities and health harms of SSBs through SSB tax supported funding.2 Allocating sugar-sweetened beverage tax revenue to address social determinants of health may positively influence support for these taxes among voters and decision makers. The study also found that funding investments to address social determinants of health outside the traditional health arena may positively influence support for this kind of tax among the public and policy makers in addition to making contributions to increasing equity and longer-term health outcomes.3 \"Foodwise Teens\" CUESA 16 IFC Promotores DiplomaBoth community members and decision makers need information about the reasons for funding recommendations (e.g., from advisory bodies or stakeholders) and on the effects of work supported with SBB tax revenues, as well as to know about ongoing opportunities to provide input on what SBB tax revenues support. Making sure that the general public and policy makers know about the SSB investments requires ongoing education campaigns and community engagement efforts, including providing updates about funding, and gathering community input on evaluation findings and funding recommendations.4 Greater investments in racial and economic equity are more common when community leaders are involved, when equity is an explicit funding priority, and when reporting on SSB tax funding takes place regularly. A recent study of 7 cities in the US (including San Francisco) with a sugar-sweetened beverage excise tax found that greater investments to promote racial and economic equity occur when 1) local community leaders are involved in setting funding priorities and making revenue allocation decisions, 2) when social and health equity is an explicit priority for the funding, and 3) when there are clear processes related to publicly reporting on the tax revenue collections, allocations, and spending.5 1.

KEY FINDINGS 1.1: The San Francisco Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax (SDDT) Ordinance and the San Francisco Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Advisory Committee (SDDTAC) align with emerging promising practices related to establishing and implementing a sugary drink tax policy that is focused on health disparities and inequities. 1.2: By intentionally including leaders of communities most targeted by the sugary drink industry, the San Francisco Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Advisory Committee has ensured that funding recommendations highlight community priorities and long-standing structural inequities. 1.3: The multi-sector membership of the SDDT Advisory Committee contributed to de-siloing and coordinating efforts to effectively address specific community needs and inequities, especially during the pandemic. 1.4: San Francisco SDDT Advisory Committee members have enhanced their understanding of San Francisco's budgeting and political processes and have begun sharing/translating that information with historically disenfranchised communities to address inequities. 20 | Finding 1SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORT21Finding 1.1: The San Francisco Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax (SDDT) Ordinance and the San Francisco Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Advisory Committee (SDDTAC) align with emerging promising practices related to establishing and implementing a sugary drink tax policy that is focused on health disparities and inequities. The approaches that SF has taken to both establish and implement the SSB tax in SF are strongly aligned with emerging best practices to address inequities and health issues identified by Healthy Food America and the Praxis Project.14, 15 The approach and process used to establish and implement a sugary drinks tax is critical. Ensuring that equity is centered when establishing and implementing the tax directly contributes to achieving equity-focused outcomes. 22 | Finding 1Examples of key processes and practices utilized in San Francisco to establish and implement a sugary drink tax include: Structuring the tax as an excise tax so distributors rather than consumers pay the tax; Engaging community members most impacted by long-standing inequities and health issues related to the consumption of sugary drinks early on; Identifying values, needs, and priorities of those most impacted by inequities and health issues to inform funding recommendations; Dedicating revenues to address the root causes of inequities and health issues; Dedicating revenues to communities and community-based organizations in impacted neighborhoods; Dedicating revenues to long-term community capacity to advocate for policy and systems change; Requiring an evaluation of tax impacts and ensuring that revenues and investments are monitored and publicly reported on; Creating public awareness campaigns about how the tax is working; Collecting and sharing stories from impacted communities on use of tax revenues; Ensuring members from impacted communities provide input into recommendations for revenue allocation and monitoring use. 14.

We really took a much broader, more effective perspective just by talking about health inequities, and structural inequities, and racism. Just using those words really set the tone from the beginning that this group is about the bigger picture and solving the problems that the soda industry is a part of.The intentional and representative guidelines for the selection of the Advisory Committee membership resulted in centering the voices, assets, and needs of San Francisco's diverse communities to address the impacts of sugary drinks by focusing on the social determinants of health. Interviewees highlighted that outlining specific membership requirements for the Advisory Committee membership through City legislation (i.e., each defined Advisory Committee seat) built the foundation to successfully support the goals of representation among Advisory Committee members. As an interviewee elaborated, the membership was strategically formulated to create a committee that included people who are \"doing the work\" in the community, and people who are doing work within institutions, striking the \"right public-private balance\". The diversity of perspectives and experiences informed the development of shared guiding principles, values, and resulted in explicitly advocating for populations that are disproportionately impacted by the sugary beverage industry in San Francisco, as well as identifying well-informed best practices related to strategies and desired health outcomes. City Hal from Tenderloin Perspective-SDDTAC Member SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORT 27IN ADDITION TO REPRESENTATIVE MEMBERSHIP, the lived experiences and intersectional identities of Advisory Committee members provided critical checks and balances for the committee when making recommendations about funding needs and priorities. Interviewees pointed out that each member of the Advisory Committee brought a broad understanding of the needs of impacted populations. However, having representation of people with lived experiences on the Advisory Committee, the Committee was more informed about how to address specific needs and recommend change because of their understanding of how their communities function. These insights were leveraged to make the Committee's impact more specific and targeted. This finding validates the approach that representation matters where decisions are made. Advisory Committee members reported bringing their \"whole selves to the table,\" referring to their professional expertise and their personal lived experiences from being in impacted communities. Reflecting on Advisory Committee member experiences, interviewees emphasized the importance of spending time building trust to increase transparency and collaboration. At the same time, some interviewees noted that the membership of the Advisory Committee should be more diverse and reflect the diversity of San Francisco. One member explained: \"The SDDTAC composition should better reflect the City of San Francisco --as [Board of Supervisors'] appointees comprise a majority of members, which leads to inequity in critical decision-making.\"Balmy Alley\u2014 Mission District 28 | Finding 1Balmy Alley\u2014 Mission District There were some decisions that needed to be made where we didn't have the full scope of what the community needed but because folks [SDDTAC members] are already in those communities, ... we [were able to] make [our] recommendations a lot clearer.\" -SDDTAC Member Meal Donation from Compass Family Services SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORT 29Finding 1.3: The multi-sector membership of the SDDT Advisory Committee contributed to de-siloing and coordinating efforts to effectively address specific community needs and inequities, especially during the pandemic. 30 | Finding 1The work of the Advisory Committee has contributed to de-siloing efforts across government agencies and community partners, supported new and re- imagined partnerships, and leveraged existing relationships to address where key health disparities and inequities exist. Interviewees agreed that the diversity of perspectives represented on the Advisory Committee facilitated cross-sector collaboration through (1) working in smaller groups through subcommittees, which allowed for deeper relationship building and further deepening long-standing partnerships; (2) identifying issues that required collaboration among all Advisory Committee members and those that required more focus on a specific community; and (3) focusing on responding to the most pressing needs of communities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A few SDDTAC member interviewees indicated that the impact on people who have done this work before was less marked, but that it was helpful for all to learn more in-depth about the story of the City, the legislative process, and how to navigate within the City's systems to support community organizing and advocacy. As an interviewee explained, \"I joined at first to ensure accountability to youth and to the community and ended up learning a lot about chairing committees and boards and being part of the political process.\" 32 | Finding 1\"It certainly opened my eyes... to the workings of the City and how legislation actually informs or can inform our policies that affect our health.

The ordinance stated that the Committee shall consist of 16 voting members, who are appointed by either the Board of Supervisors or certain City departments. The powers and duties of the Committee are to make recommendations to the Mayor and the Board of Supervisors on the effectiveness of the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax and to submit a report that evaluates the impact of the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax on beverage prices, consumer purchasing behavior, and public health. The Committee also provides recommendations regarding the potential establishment and/or funding of programs to reduce the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages in San Francisco. In May of 2018, SFDPH took over SDDTAC staffing for the City Administrator's office and the Committee began meeting. According to the SF ordinance, unless the Board of Supervisors extends the term of the Advisory Committee, the Advisory Committee will end on December 31, 2028.I had never been part of anything political and now I'm looked at as a resource in my community for folks who are aspiring to be on committees and boards\u2014[and] they ask me about the process.

SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORT 39SISTERWEB PROFILE: A powerful web: leading with values and impacting birthing people, their families, their communities, and the health care system SF SDDT funding is carefully allocated to organizations and agencies that embody the SDDTAC-identified values and are able to effectively implement the SDDT strategies. Many organizations in San Francisco are doing critical work that engages communities historically burdened by inequities. Among these organizations, and arguably an organization that is exemplary of the purpose of the San Francisco Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax, is SisterWeb (SW). This small and growing organization has an ambitious mission and embodies all four values identified by the SF SDDT Advisory Committee. In essence, what is unique to SW is what SDDT funding is all about. SisterWeb's work is grounded in supporting community- led and culturally relevant work, building strong collaborations and partnerships, eliminating structural inequities, and prioritizing results and long-term impacts.SisterWeb Pre COVID-19 Pandemic 40 | Finding 2SisterWeb Pre COVID-19 Pandemic So how does SW lead with their values and accomplish so much? SisterWeb was founded in 2018 to address the long-standing maternal and infant health crisis that disproportionately affects women of color and their infants. SisterWeb is a community doula organization that offers no-cost culturally and linguistically congruent doula care to Black, Pacific Islander, and Latinx birthing people in San Francisco through three different programs: Kindred Birth Companions, MANA Pasefika, and Semilla Sagrada. By providing tailored doula services by members of the same communities, SW reaches community members prioritized by SF SDDTAC. Doulas throughout the US are typically employed as contractors, and get paid by the birth. SW, however, has been set up to offer salaried positions with benefits and professional development opportunities that support women of color to obtain and retain jobs as professional birth workers in San Francisco. SW doulas and staff are from the communities that they serve, and most SW doulas are bilingual and bicultural-- meaning that they are able to provide culturally congruent care to their clients. By hiring staff and doulas from communities most burdened by historic inequities, providing stable salaries, and offering professional development opportunities, SW is directly supporting community-led and culturally relevant work and contributing to economic justice. The organization does this by lifting up community wisdom, intentionally addressing inequities in the health care system, and by prioritizing long- term results and impacts through their evaluation efforts. And pregnant people and their families benefit from SW's services that are typically too expensive to even consider. Funding for SW aligns with the following SDDT strategies: Build community capacity and develop leadership Provide health promoting education, programs, and services Related to healthy eating (including beverages)/making nutritious choices Related to breastfeeding Related to physical activity Related to trauma/adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) Provide job readiness, skills training and career pathways Increase opportunities for physical activity Increase economic opportunities in priority neighborhoods Increase healthy messaging related to nutrition SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORT 41In addition to providing benefited employment and doula services to SF community members most burdened by inequities, they are also contributing to longer-term systemic change by providing prenatal care trainings to healthcare providers, participating in maternal/child health- focused collaborations, and supporting legislative change to improve birth outcomes. SW staff, for example, are part of a Champion Dyad program in partnership with the Labor and Delivery Units in all five hospitals in San Francisco. Through this program, a SisterWeb staff member partners with a doctor, nurse, and/or midwife \"champion\" at the hospital to ensure equitable treatment during pregnancies and births of Black, Latinx, and Pacific Islander pregnant people. This work is critical to creating a more equitable health care system and achieving positive birth outcomes for families who are traditionally marginalized by the health care system in general and during their birthing experiences in particular. [The SDDT] investment helped SisterWeb address structural racism, implicit bias, and inequity embedded in the U.S. maternity care system and advance diversity, equity, and inclusion for the organization... Black, Latinx, and Pacific Islander doulas benefited employment as well as employing leadership and support staff who come from the same communities served. SisterWeb Staff SisterWeb Doula Group Photo Pre COVID-19 Pandemic 42 | Finding 2With SDDT funding, SisterWeb helped Black and Brown families to have safer and healthier births, supported Black and Brown doulas in their careers, and provided leadership opportunities that included higher wages with increased responsibilities to Black and Brown women. All of this increased the representation of Black and Brown communities in San Francisco's maternal care system. SisterWeb StaffTo track progress, SW is implementing a robust evaluation plan that aligns with the Results Based Accountability framework and uses Compyle software. The organization has identified goals, outcomes, and metrics that are used to report on their work, identify lessons learned, and make program and organizational improvements to grow and become sustainable.

SOMCAN was formed by community leaders to address gentrification and displacement issues in the South of Market (SOMA) community. Over the last twenty years, SOMCAN has worked on a wide range of issues from tenant rights to community planning to Filipino language access to workers' rights, providing culturally competent direct services that include tenant counseling, family support, youth empowerment, and employment. 50 | Finding 2 SOM CAN Representative Speaking with Resident Pre COVID-19 Pandemic Kalusugan ng Bayan/Our Health, Our Community is a three-year initiative developed by Filipinos and Filipinas at SOMCAN to improve the well-being of Filipinos in San Francisco. The initiative seeks to address the community's chronic health issues such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, Type 2 diabetes, overweight/obesity, in addition to improving built environment conditions that contribute to these conditions. The initiative aims to understand the community's knowledge, attitudes, behaviors and risk factors related to chronic diseases; increase community awareness of chronic disease prevention; and advocate for policy and environmental strategies that support health. Funded by the SDDT three-year Healthy Communities grant, the work of SOMCAN helps move forward the SF SDDT core value to support community-led and culturally relevant work in San Francisco, specifically in improving behavioral and health outcomes in Filipino- American communities. In the first part of 2020, SDDT funding helped support staffing costs for three staff and nine Community Health Ambassadors to conduct the community health assessment using community-based participatory action research. Ambassadors ranged in age from 14 to 73 years old and all spoke both Tagalog and English. They provided translation support, compiled surveys, conducted outreach, and connected with non-profit organizations in the area. Due to the COVID-19 shelter-in- place ordinance, they couldn't conduct in-person community meetings to disseminate the assessment findings. Instead, the group quickly pivoted to share their findings via an infographic in English and Filipino with their 1,600 social media followers; 1,888 newsletter subscribers; and diverse social networks including SOMA Pilipinas with 2,154 followers, Pin@y Advocates/Community Educators with 1,600 members, and 25 partners across the San Francisco who provide services to Filipinos. During that same time period, SOMCAN also conducted free weekly physical activity for Filipino residents and workers through in-person and, shortly after, virtual online classes. Workshops included: U-Jam urban dance, K-pop dance, Daluyan movement and exploration of stories, Energy work, Alchemist healing, Joyful Movement Mediation, Kapwa Fitness, and Twin Hearts loving-kindness meditation. These health classes had over 871 participants. 51SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORT Building on these successes, SOMCAN accomplished the following in the fiscal period of July 2020 to June 2021: WORKSHOPS Leadership and technical assistance trainings Eight multigenerational Filipinx community members (continuing and new) were recruited for the second phase of implementation. All community members were from San Francisco's South of Market, Tenderloin, Haight/Ashbury, and Excelsior neighborhoods. Health education workshops and seminars SOMCAN partnered with a local Filipino organization called Mabuhay Health Center (MHC) to host the health workshops for the next program phase. In partnership, they conducted monthly health education webinars to inform the Filipino community about resources. Webinars included presentations about COVID-19, testing centers, self-care strategies, and vaccine information. Other workshop topics included coping mechanisms and behavioral health, safe exercises and physical activity, health insurance, diabetes, Intergenerational/ Intercultural connections, nutritious and mindful eating, gout, obesity, and maintaining healthy routines. Program-related materials were created by MHC with translation support from the Ambassadors, and SOMCAN Ambassadors also focused on further assessment, evaluation, and community outreach. SOMCAN Youth Leaders 52 | Finding 2 SOMCAN Youth Leaders CULTURALLY RELEVANT EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS Handouts and infographics in English and Filipino Topics included: COVID-19 and vaccine information, physical activity, Medicare, understanding mental health, and diabetes and intergenerational trauma. SOMCAN and the Community Health Ambassadors distributed the infographic handouts at food delivery distribution, community events and tabling opportunities, and shared the infographic handouts to the Filipino Services providers network. Promotional videos Created animated health videos focusing on chronic disease prevention (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and obesity) and promoting SOMCAN's health programs. Videos highlighted multigenerational health perspectives of the Filipino community, with five in English and 6 in Filipino. Cooking workshops SOMCAN collaborated with Kultivate Labs, a local non- profit organization, to conduct Filipino cooking workshops with the overall aim of teaching traditional Filipino dishes with a healthy and nutritious twist. Some of the cooking demos included Vegan Filipino Spaghetti, Air Fried Kale & Garlic Lumpias, Veganized Chicken Tinola, and Italian twists on Filipino Classics. Each cooking demo was attended by about over 15 participants online on Zoom/Facebook Livestream. All the cooking classes dishes are based on input from participants and the Community Health Ambassadors, who played an important role in the community outreach, promotion and engagement of the cooking workshops. Community Health Assessment 53SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORTFinding 2.2: Utilizing trauma-informed, healing-centered approaches has enabled some SDDT-funded programs to effectively engage communities which cumulatively experience the most health inequities. Most people experience some trauma\u2014and everyone experiences stress. Structural, institutional, and interpersonal racism and other inequities mean that Black, indigenous, and other people of color and other historically disenfranchised communities are much more likely to experience trauma, to experience many kinds of trauma, and to experience toxic stress. Resiliency factors like caring relationships, positive coping skills, and believing in oneself all help protect people from the harmful health impacts of trauma and toxic stress. Trauma-informed and healing-centered programming helps develop and strengthen resilience where it is most needed. 54 | Finding 2Trauma-informed services and programs address trauma as a root cause of behavior and use an understanding of trauma and recovery to change organizational systems, policies, and practices that retraumatize people. While being trauma-informed looks different for every organization, it requires an organizational commitment to: Prioritize safety for community members or clients and their empowerment and choices Transparency, collaboration, and peer support Recognize socio-cultural trauma and structural oppression Healing-centered organizations use holistic, culturally-grounded approaches to foster individual well-being, strengthen individuals' sense of belonging to a supportive community, and support collective healing. Often incorporating civic action as a way to change components of inequitable and traumatizing environments, these approaches also: Support respectful and effective relationships in which people are seen as their whole selves Strive to be equitable, accountable, inclusive, and collaborative Work with community members to make meaning out of the past and to identify meaningful changes now and into the future Encourage growth at the individual, interpersonal, and community levels (including by making space for reflection) Trauma Resilience Post from Bounce Back Generation SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORT 55Requity, Peace Parks, and Bounce Back Generation all offer trauma-informed and healing-centered programming developed by and for residents of HOPE SF public housing site and other residents of San Francisco's Eastern neighborhoods. Program staff are relatable to community members because they share many life experiences with program participants, which helps programming feel relevant and interesting to community members. Having programming that is fun and that teaches new information and skills also functions to normalize and de-stigmatize program participation. Staff develop trusting relationships with community members over time by being a consistent and caring presence, recognizing and affirming how participants are unique and special, and helping connect community members with resources and opportunities. Requity Led Activity 56 | Finding 2Requity Led Activity I want to give up Gatorade. When I gave up soda I overcompensated with Gatorade. I didn't know it had so much sugar until I started working with Sweet Communities. I thought I was doing good by drinking a sports drink but turns out it has a lot of sugar. Sweet Communities has inspired me to look at labels closer. In the past 3.5 weeks (I am) drinking more water and less sodas. And (got) no migraines or headaches. I'm going to continue by consuming water and weaning myself off soda.\u2014BBG participant \u2014BBG participantBounce Back Generation's Sweet Communities curriculum and messaging teaches why cutting back on sugar is good for one's physical and emotional health and supports participants in identifying how to eat healthier in sustainable ways without reinforcing shame or guilt around food and beverage consumption. A core element of supporting healthier eating is to educate participants about how trauma and stress impact people physically and by supporting one another in developing healthier coping skills to use when stressed or triggered. The curriculum also educates people about how the beverage industry markets sugary beverages using emotions and that lower-income communities and communities of color are disproportionately targeted with advertising for sugary drinks. Participants are encouraged to reflect on their own relationship to sugar and to experiment with how they feel when they have one less soda or one less teaspoon of sugar in their coffee.Why do people drink sugary beverages?16 Perceived need (e.g., satisfy cravings, quench thirst) Physical and cognitive benefits (e.g., provide energy, improve attention) Emotional and interpersonal benefits (e.g., relieve anger, facilitate socializing) Sensory properties (e.g., taste, carbonation) External cues (e.g., family/peer modeling, availability) For low income parents who are raising their kids in circumstances marked by scarcity and financial insecurity, giving their kids a bag of Doritos [and] a $1 can of soda is one of the few ways that they can say 'yes' to their children on a daily basis, that they can show their kids that they love them, that they hear them, that they can honor their preferences. And so even though these parents know that a can of Dr. Pepper is not the most nutritionally sound choice, it's also a very emotionally nourishing choice for their children. So what makes perhaps little sense from a public health perspective makes a lot of sense from a psychological perspective, if you take into account the really different contexts that parents are raising their kids in.

SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORT 57BBG PROFILE: Addressing by reaching key populations through resilience and trauma-informed approaches: Bounce Back Generation (BBG) Emotional trauma, adversity in childhood, and ongoing stress impact children, the adults who care for them, and the future adults that children will become. Research has shown that the more Adverse Childhood Experiences a child has, the more likely they will experience learning difficulties, emotional problems, and serious health concerns for a lifetime. In 2011, Bounce Back Generation (BBG) began their work as the Healthy Generations Project in a public housing community in San Francisco following the advice of a grandmother who expressed that \"we are all suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder\" because of the constant presence of violent crime, drug use, poverty, institutional racism, and domestic dysfunction. This grandmother's words continue to ring true today as many aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic are creating adverse childhood experiences for a generation of children. \"I Am a Hero\" BBG Facebook Post 58 | Finding 2\"I Am a Hero\" BBG Facebook Post Based on the wisdom of the community and the leading research on the health impacts of trauma and toxic stress, BBG has created and tested practical tools over the last ten years to improve educational achievement, support healthy childhood development, increase community involvement, and transform individuals and communities. BBG's peer hiring and training program lifts up parents, grandparents, and concerned community members as \"resilience- builders\" and change agents for themselves, their families, and communities. BBG teaches adults and children how to understand and manage the connections between brain, body, and emotions and how to transform homes, schools, and workplaces so that people, places, and practices can create opportunities to recover and grow stronger. The SF SDDTAC also understands that targeted funding to organizations that are trauma-informed and build community resilience is critical to create population-level changes over time. The SF SDDTAC also emphasizes the importance of addressing inequities by reaching key communities targeted by the sugary drinks industry to counteract those messages and support community leadership. BBG's work strongly embodies SDDT's core value to support community-led, trauma-informed work that is culturally responsive and aligns with the SDDT-identified strategies focused on building community capacity and developing leadership, providing job readiness training, expanding access to healthy food and water, and increasing healthy messaging related to nutrition.SDDT strategies: Build community capacity and develop leadership using trauma-informed approaches that address adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and stress Providing job readiness opportunities Expand access to healthy food, water, and oral health Increase healthy messaging related to nutrition We believe that in order to change behavior, we must understand the root causes of that behavior. Negative coping skills such as using sugar to manage emotional states and stress can be shifted to different coping skills that make you 'feel good today, and better tomorrow'. BBG Staff 59SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORTDuring the fiscal period of July 2020 to June 2021: Funding from SDDT helped support employment and training opportunities for BBG staff, particularly in the Potrero Hill neighborhood of San Francisco. Five people conducted community health worker activities as promotoras, primarily in Spanish. Outreach supporters were trained on safe door to door practices and text/social media outreach, and training continues on weekly basis. In terms of community reach and participation, activities and programming were provided in English, primarily in the Bayview Hunters Point, Outer Mission, and Potrero Hills neighborhoods of San Francisco. Participants included 340 community members who were part of low/lower-income households and who were more likely to identify as Black/African American (76%), Asian (8%), or Pacific Islander (6%). In addressing trauma and adverse childhood experiences, a total of 24 resilience building workshops were conducted with 104 duplicated (35 unduplicated) community members. Workshop sessions included 'Stress and Your Health', 'Food as Memory: How Childhood Affects us as Adults', and 'Food as Celebration'. Programming was informed by a COVID-19 survey completed with 33 responses, which all staff reviewed and discussed ways to improve online workshop outreach and content. BBG also actively promoted drinking fewer sugary drinks by creating instructional videos about making low-sugar iced tea, and another about drinking tea as a healthy coping skill. BBG trained and continue to work with a film crew to create emotionally impactful and science supported information on reducing stress and improving COVID safety and prevention. With a focus on making nutritious choices and increasing healthy beverage consumption, BBG held food giveaways that expanded community access to healthy food and water and increased healthy messaging related to nutrition with 298 unduplicated individuals through an Easter/Spring gift bag giveaway. 6 Building Blocks for Resilience Guide 60 | Finding 2BBG began this fiscal year, as everyone did, in the worst periods of the pandemic. The community was telling us they were feeling afraid and overwhelmed during the lockdowns. While services were reaching them with food and protective equipment, they were losing connections with their family, friends, and neighbors. We identified the need for creating connections... We began by creating videos that were made by Potrero public housing residents that reflected their feelings. We encouraged stay-at-home activities for the holidays, and sent examples of how we were coping through COVID. BBG looks forward to expanding this COVID model, created out of necessity but filled with opportunities to use our media-based tools to expand our reach. Our communities are more aware of the need for coping tools, wellness strategies, and building resilience for themselves and children.

These tasks forces were created in 2015 to eliminate racial and income disparities in children's oral health. They do this by increasing access to dental and oral healthcare (including by supporting integration with other healthcare), providing culturally and linguistically responsive oral health education, establishing a population- based oral health surveillance system. One community task force exists for each of the neighborhoods with the poorest children's oral health outcomes: Chinatown, the Mission, and District 10 (Bayview Hunters Point and the Excelsior). In 2020-20201, the task forces used SDDT funds to: Develop, translate, and run local print and radio advertisements, Integrate oral health components into existing promotores/community health worker training curricula, and Conduct research with community members to inform taskforce efforts. Chinatown Children's Oral Health Taskforce (NICOS) SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORT 65 CTFCOH PROFILE: Improving equitable access to oral health in impacted communities through strong partnerships: Chinatown Task Force on Children's Oral Health (CTFCOH) Tooth decay or dental caries is a silent epidemic affecting children of all ages. If left untreated at an early age, it leads to pain that interferes with daily life, school absences that undermine learning key skills, and lifelong dental problems that compromise overall health. Although almost entirely preventable, tooth decay continues to be the most common chronic childhood disease in the United States. In San Francisco, rates of dental caries from kindergarten screenings range from 40% to almost 60% in some neighborhoods among Black/African American, Latinx, and Asian American children, with Asian American children experiencing the highest rates of dental decay. The communities at highest risk include linguistically isolated families whose first language is not English, immigrant families, Medi-Cal eligible or enrolled children, and children with special health care needs. Health Starts from the Mouth Campaign Poster 66 | Finding 2 CavityFree SF, previously known as the San Francisco Children's Oral Health Collaborative, coordinates a city-wide effort which seeks to reduce disparities and improve the oral health of children in San Francisco by increasing access to quality care and services, integrating oral health into overall health, and promoting oral health among high- need communities and neighborhoods. CavityFree SF invited community organizations to join in a unique opportunity to organize and form sustainable oral health task forces to implement the Children's Oral Health Strategic Plan for San Francisco by improving access to culturally competent care and appropriate utilization of services, determining best practices of community-level oral health behavior practices based on community-identified needs and preferences, and implementing those findings to promote and encourage adoption of healthier oral health behaviors. In San Francisco's District 3, the NICOS Chinese Health Coalition formed in 2015 and continues to convene the Chinatown Task Force on Children's Oral Health (CTFCOH), one of three neighborhood- based collaborations addressing oral health disparities in children of color. Supported with SDDT funds, CTFCOH aligns with all SDDT core values and is a strong example of building strong collaborations and partners that increase capacity and effectiveness, specifically in improving outcomes related to water and sugary drink consumption which are directly connected to dental caries. During the fiscal period of July 2020 to June 2021: Funding from SDDT helped support partial staffing costs of four positions for CTFCOH in program management, coordination, and health education. All the staff identified as Chinese. CTFCOH engaged 1,879 community members in planning, implementation, or evaluation of program activities. A vast majority of these community members (99%, n=1,859) identified as Asian. CTFCOH staff conducted in-person outreach at seven different community events and promoted oral health and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption awareness to a total of 1,778 community members. CTFCOH provided targeted education to 165 community members via two virtual oral health workshops and one virtual \"Less Sugar, Sweeter Life\" workshop. CTFCOH also aired a public service announcement about children's oral health and the five key preventive messages on Chinese radio stations on an ongoing basis, as well as developed a set of corresponding print ads. 67SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORT During outreach, CTFCOH staff distributed the project's 'Less Sugar, Sweeter Life' brochure to community members to bring awareness on the sugar content of common beverages and the negative health impacts of consuming them. Staff also provided one workshop about SSB consumption and its negative health impacts virtually during the period. Moreover, in its media messaging on cavity prevention throughout the period, the CTFCOH emphasized reducing consumption of food and drinks containing sugar and white flour. At the Chinatown Community Health Fair which it sponsored, event organizers provided staff/volunteers one beverage only, tap water. CTFCOH partnered with 19 organizations or groups through membership in the task force, ongoing collaboration and coordination, and reflective evaluation and learning.

In addition, wildfires and poor air quality issues in September and October created additional barriers for us to reach the community effectively. However, NICOS/ CTFCOH made the best of the situation and continued to conduct in-person outreach whenever possible to provide educational grab-n-go bags at food pantry sites and at outdoors community-based events such as Walkway Weekends. In addition, NICOS/CTFCOH expanded our presence online by providing several web-based workshops on oral health-related topics to our partner organizations and community groups. NICOS Chinatown OfficeCTFCOH Staff 69SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORTFinding 2.4: SDDT grant funds are helping to establish community-driven efforts to change inequitable policies, systems, and environments in San Francisco. There are a range of ways that SDDT grants fund organizations and agencies to make changes to policies, systems, and environments. One way includes explicitly directing SDDT funds to support interventions that make policy, systems, and environmental (PSE) changes to prevent and mitigate diet-sensitive chronic disease. PSE-specific strategies have the potential to reach, and therefore impact, large numbers of community members. 70 | Finding 2Five grant projects focused on policy, systems, and environmental (PSE) changes were funded beginning in January 2021. These three-year grants use the model which the San Francisco Department of Public Health's tobacco control programs have used for more than a decade to identify and prioritize PSE changes based on community research, and then to advocate for those PSE changes most important to community members. In addition to the PSE-specific funded grantees, all SDDT-funded grantees are encouraged to address structural inequities by focusing on effecting change through policies, systems, and environmental changes. Many of the organizations and agencies funded by the SDDT Healthy Communities grants also focus part of their work on changing policies, systems and the environment. One example is the work that Bayview Hunters Point Community Advocates is doing to improve economic and workforce development opportunities and systems so that historically marginalized community members have access to meaningful jobs. In other cases, organizations are focusing on implementing organizational wellness policies (which include requiring water be served at meetings and events), creating videos and recipes for no sugar beverages, providing training and videos about how to break the habit of drinking soda and other sugary beverages, explaining the health benefits of drinking water, and improving eating habits. PSE DEFINITIONS Policy Change: The creation of written statement of an organizational position which helps an organization change its course of action that will address health, health equity, and social determinants of health that impact health outcomes. The organization can be in the public, non-profit, or business sectors. System Change: A change in how organizations or multiple agencies conduct business, such as changing ongoing organizational decisions or outcomes that will address health, health equity, and social determinants of health that impact health outcomes. Environmental Change: Observable changes to the built and physical environment, as well as changes to the economic, social, or media environments that will address health, health equity, and social determinants of health that impact health outcomes.

In addition to providing affordable, healthy food, our community co- op grocery (and SDDT investment in our food programs) is also helping us deliver important services in health/wellness education, workforce development, and employment for Bayview Hunters Point. That in turn helps build neighborhood power and stability for the current residents of the neighborhood, one of the most diverse (and vulnerable) in San Francisco. Community-based social/economic developments like this are necessary if we are going to defend our neighborhoods against the pressures of displacement and gentrification. BVHPCA Staff Bayview Co-op Grocery 72 | Finding 2 Bayview Hunters Point Community Advocates (BVHPCA) began in 1994 as a grassroots organization, founded, governed, and operated by members of the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood in San Francisco. Since its beginning, the organization has combined community organizing with education, advocacy and direct services, with a specific focus on environmental and economic justice. Bayview Hunters Point (BVHP) is a racially diverse and predominantly low-income community with approximately 35,890 residents and is located in the southeast corner of San Francisco. BVHP has had a history of community organizing to address long-standing environmental issues related to the decommissioned Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, and to ensure access to healthy foods. BVHP has been described as a food swamp: a neighborhood in which fresh, healthy produce is hard to find, but alcohol outlets, fast food, and highly processed foods are common. In 2019, BVHPCA renewed its organizational commitment to environmental justice advocacy, and established the Southeast Community Council (SECC). BVHPCA began recruiting local leaders and community members to become SECC council members, with the aim of providing leadership opportunities, and trainings related to environmental issues and advocacy, as well as providing a stipend of $200-$500 a month to participating community members. Hosted and led by BVHPCA, the SECC established subcommittees on policing and injustice; emerging technology; finance and economics; health and wellness; transit and transportation; air, soil, water and pollution; education; and outreach and research. The SECC also covered topics such as displacement, economic development, and workplace diversity as regular agenda items. In 2019, BVHPCA also received a 3-year SDDT Healthy Community grant to address the historic and structural inequities that BHVP residents have inherited from decades of racist environmental, economic, and social policies. The SDDT grant outlined support for building community capacity, developing local leadership, providing health promoting education and services, expanding access to healthy food, and increasing local workforce development and economic opportunities in the neighborhood. Specifically, the SDDT grant was dedicated to creating a much needed grocery co-operative in this southeast neighborhood of San Francisco. With the grant, BVHPCA identified key steps toward creating the grocery co-operative including: incorporating the grocery co-operative with an ongoing non-profit partner (BVHPCA) for food education and workforce development; developing a community survey to gather input and test interest in the co-op; creating a business plan or capital plan for the co-op; identifying a location for the co-operative grocery store; and implementing an evaluation. Bayview Hunters Point 73SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORTStructural change typically takes years and is often incremental. This project was no exception, and surprisingly, both benefited from and was delayed because of the pandemic. BVHPCA had established the Southeast Community Council (SECC) in early 2020 when the pandemic began. The SECC served to build community leadership (and included providing incentives to participants) and created an opportunity to effectively and efficiently identify and meet emerging community needs, especially those hardest hit by this crisis. Immediate community needs included access to food and personal protective equipment (PPE), and BVHPCA was poised to help. SDDT provided additional funds to address pandemic-related needs, and BVHPCA was able to quickly establish the Bayview Bounty Bags free food and PPE program. As BVHPCA Development Director, Tony Kelly explained, the Bounty Bags program was able to \"leverage BVHPCA's deep community connections and expertise\", and at the same time take advantage of a unique opportunity for the organization. He continued, \"Six months later, we had extensive experience in space management, produce buying, and food box preparation, and a network of vendors, suppliers, and national allies\u2014including the San Francisco Wholesale Produce Market\u2014our new landlord\u2014informing our plans for a neighborhood-owned cooperative grocery.\" The lease at the SF Wholesale Produce Market also allowed for BVHPCA to establish an office and community space for longer-term use. Bayview Grocery 74 | Finding 2Cooperative economics is a pathway to local food sovereignty. The research and development of our community-owned grocery cooperative is designed to work in concert with our alliances with non-profit and for-profit food distributors, potential partners in the South and North Bay, and retail small-grocery associations and food vendors in the region to create a stronger supply chain\u2014extending from Black and Brown farms in central California to food-insecure households throughout the Bay Area that deserve access to farm- to-table food quality. This sustainable supply chain can help cure food insecurity for many years to come. BVHPCA StaffThe Bounty Bags program not only provided weekly access to healthy food to low-income diverse community members throughout the southeast neighborhoods of San Francisco, but also created work experience and income-earning opportunities for local community members. In great part because of the program's success, BVPHCA recently obtained a Community Hub grant by OEWD (starting in late 2021), and is discussing additional food security and neighborhood outreach partnership opportunities with OEWD, SFDPH and SF HSH. The organization anticipates that the community market study survey will finally be launched in the fall/winter of 2021, and is offering survey respondents a discount on co-op boxes as an incentive to complete the survey. Further indicating broad recognition of the many successes of the Bounty Bags program, BVHPCA has also recently signed a 4-year lease with the Produce Market, secured a MOU with Mandela Partners for the co-op box supply, and has received additional foundation support to launch a co-op box program along with the produce market, further expanding the network between farms run and owned by Black and Brown farmers and underserved customers and constituencies. The co-op is now in sight and\u2014despite the hardships experienced by so many during the pandemic\u2014brings the hope of fulfilling a long-time community vision. 75SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORTFINDING 3 Organizations and agencies used SDDT funding to help those communities experiencing the worst health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic meet basic needs while simultaneously supporting the structural changes necessary to promote equity.

It was designed to make receiving the COVID-19 vaccine as convenient and comfortable as possible for as many people as possible and has focused resources on communities and neighborhoods disproportionately affected by the pandemic. San Francisco's vaccination strategy has focused on the neighborhoods that have been most impacted by COVID-19: those in the Southeast sector of the city including the Mission, Bayview Hunters Point, Excelsior, and Visitacion Valley. Vaccinating communities with the highest prevalence of COVID-19 is one of the fastest ways to decrease the spread of the disease. Furthermore, given disparate COVID-19 prevalence across neighborhoods and communities within San Francisco, concentrating vaccination efforts in communities most heavily impacted by the disease will significantly bend the disease curve, while also saving more lives. COVID-19's impact has reinforced nationwide health inequities, as the pandemic has disproportionately impacted low-income communities and communities of color \u2014but the COVID-19 vaccine rollout has been an important opportunity to address some of these inequities.Person being vaccinated 82 | Finding 3Person being vaccinated At the end of June 2021 (also the end of the 2020-2021 fiscal year), San Francisco celebrated a huge milestone: 70% of San Francisco's Latinx residents 12 and older had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine! That translated to more than 93,000 community members protected. It was also more than double the state and national vaccination rate at the time for Latinx residents (28% of Latinx Californians 12 and older had then received at least 1 vaccination dose, and 30% of Latinx residents in the U.S. had).21When the COVID-19 pandemic began, we knew that strong community partnerships would be the key to keeping all residents safe and healthy... with low barrier access to vaccines and a strong network of trusted community partners on the ground, we have reached the important milestone of 70% of the eligible Latino population in San Francisco receiving at least one vaccine dose.

As Finding 1.1 presents (see pg 26), the San Francisco Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Advisory Committee has been comprised of members of those communities most impacted by beverage marketing and by diet-related chronic diseases. The combination of these relationships and those with organizations and agencies which have received multiple years of SDDT funding has meant that funded programs began the 2020-2021 fiscal year with established relationships and having established themselves as a trusted source of information and resources. 84 | Finding 3Nutritious Meals for Students The San Francisco Unified School District's Student Nutrition Services (SNS) used SDDT funding in 2019-2020 to improve their capacity to prepare healthy and appealing meals, to make these meals available at all SFUSD schools, and to educate SFUSD students and their families about school meals (specifically with a focus on increasing students' participation in school meals). This investment in physical infrastructure and communications has served the program well since SFUSD closed schools in response to shelter-in-place orders. In March 2020, SNS established 17 Grab and Go meal sites at SFUSD sites throughout San Francisco and continued to operate these throughout the 2020-2021 fiscal year. SFUSD students and families enrolled in the Free and Reduced Price Meal program could pick up 1 week of meals per week, and single meals were also provided for all SFUSD community members on other days of the week. SNS also coordinated delivering meals to families of students with disabilities and other families with barriers to getting meals from the Grab and Go sites. SFUSD Food Distribution SFUSD Student Nutrition Services provided more than 7.5 million meals to SFUSD families during 2020-2021! Impacted Neighborhoods Least ImpactedMost ImpactedGrab and Go Meal Distribution Sites 85 SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORTSTUDENT NUTRITION SERVICES PROFILE: Student Nutrition Services designed, implemented, and continually improved a meal delivery program to ensure that the most vulnerable students received meals. Initially this program was targeted to get meals to students with disabilities, recognizing that some families would not be able to leave the house or get to Grab and Go sites because of their children's disabilities and barriers to accessibility. However, once the program was established SNS staff collaborated with other SFUSD employees and stakeholders to review and expand the eligibility criteria for receiving meal deliveries to ensure that meals were delivered to reduce inequities. Healthy Food Distribution 86 | Finding 3Healthy Food Distribution PARTNERING WITH SFUSD MEAL DISTRIBUTION EVENTS TO ENCOURAGE GOOD AT-HOME ORAL HEALTH PRACTICES Toothbrushes should be replaced every 3 months. To support good oral health practices and to help ensure that brushing was as effective as possible, SFDPH dental services collaborated with SFUSD's Student Nutrition Services to include oral health maintenance supplies and educational materials in meal bags distributed to students enrolled in the Free & Reduced Price Meal program. The SFDPH Dental Services team participated in 1 meal distribution day at each of the 17 sites between Jan and Jun 2021, including these materials in every grocery bag given out on that day. DPH dental staff were on-site to provide information about Medi-Cal Dental and other resources and to answer questions while families picked up meals.10,356 10,356 toothbrushes were distributed to SFUSD students! The SFUSD SNS Meal Delivery Program provided meals to more than 300 families (including both eligible students and their siblings) throughout 2020-2021.The meal delivery program rapidly grew in scale (starting by delivering meals to 12 students on April 1, 2020, then 95 students the following week, and quickly grew to serve more than 300 students every week. For the first 9 months of the pandemic, SFUSD employees and volunteers made the program a reality, but a partnership with a delivery logistics organization and an external meal vendor in January 2021 enabled the program to expand to serve even more students. SNS employees conducted phone surveys in June 2020 to increase participation in the program, and used what they heard to identify systems-level solutions to issues that families had experienced with the program by that point in time. One major change to the program was to increase how many meals were delivered to families based on the number of siblings in the household (since if a family could not get to a Grab and Go site because of one child's access needs and/or health concerns, they still needed meals for all children). 300+ 87 SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORTSDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORTCOORDINATING WITH COMMUNITY LEARNING HUBS TO PROVIDE ORAL HEALTH SCREENINGS AND IDENTIFY URGENT AND EMERGENCY ORAL HEALTH NEEDS Although most San Francisco Unified School District students and teachers spent most of the school year engaged in distance learning, the Community Learning Hubs supported students with significant challenges through a hybrid model so they were able to participate in distance learning. The San Francisco Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) established more than 70 Community Learning Hubs throughout San Francisco at library branches, recreational facilities, and trusted community-based organizations. Students experiencing homelessness, in the child welfare/foster care system, and living in public housing could utilize these hubs to access high-speed and reliable internet, get help with technology, and get other supports. The SFDPH Dental Team collaborated with the Community Learning Hubs and then DCYF's Summer Programs to plan for in-person oral health care services for students: dental screenings, fluoride varnish (an oral health preventive service) and care coordination for urgent dental needs. Services were offered to all Community Learning Hub managers. Ultimately events were held outdoors at the 9 hubs which had managers who felt it would be feasible to host (e.g., given physical space and staffing) and to obtain signed consent forms from students' parents/ guardians prior to the event. All children at the program sites received toothbrushes. SFDPH dental staff also provided each hub manager with a follow up email listing every child screened with visible dental problems and recommendations for how the child's parent/guardian could address the issue. For those children screened with urgent dental issues who had consented to have care coordination, SFDPH health workers contacted and worked with the families to link them to dental care. For any child screened with urgent dental issues who did not have consent for care coordination, detailed follow-up recommendations were provided for program staff on the day of the screening and again in the follow up email.United Playaz Oral Health Screening Location (Photo from Google Maps by Steven Smith) SF DPH DENTAL TEAM PROFILE: SFDPH Dental Staff coordinated with Community Learning Hubs and Summer Programs sites to provide oral health screenings. 88 | Finding 3United Playaz Oral Health Screening Location (Photo from Google Maps by Steven Smith) No visible cavities Mild cavitiesDental Screening Results 79%13% Urgent/big cavities without mouth pain Emergency dental care needed; mouth pain Oral Health Screenings with DCYF Summer Programs Sites Impacted Neighborhoods Least ImpactedMost ImpactedDental Screenings Parks 89 SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORTSDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORTFresh Produce for Low-Income Adults Both the City and County of San Francisco and the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Advisory Committee have consistently recognized food security as a priority outcome for work funded by the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax. SDDT funds have helped increase the capacity of programs that have addressed food insecurity in San Francisco for decades and which are experts in the opportunities and barriers to increasing food security for specific populations. This organizational expertise and familiarity with the landscape of food and nutrition resources enabled the Healthy Food Purchasing Supplement grantees (EatSF's Vouchers4Veggies, the Heart of the City Farmers Market, and A Better Course) to effectively and creatively respond to the dramatic increase in food insecurity overall, while also making improvements to their inventory and redemption systems to reduce processing and wait times. Systems changes made during 2020-2021 included: Moving from a daily distribution model of a daily limit of $5 in Market Match incentives/supplements per person to a monthly distribution model with a monthly limit of $30 in Market Match per person \u00bbThis change dramatically reduced wait times for people getting Market Match incentives/supplements. The increased need resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic's economic impacts dramatically increased the number of unduplicated people participating in the program - which also meant that people had to wait up to 45 minutes to get their $5 Market Match supplements in fall and winter 2020. Once the model was shifted to a monthly distribution, wait times decreased to less than 5 minutes per participant to access $30 in Market Match incentives/supplements. Vouchers4Veggies Participant, Eat SF 90 | Finding 3 Implementing $5 Market Match vouchers that utilize bar codes instead of the prior model of $1 tokens and tracking supplement distribution using Square at the point of sale \u00bbThis shift eliminated the difficulty of maintaining a sufficient inventory of Market Match tokens given the rapid increase in people receiving tokens and the varied timeframes in which participants redeemed the tokens. Switching from an \"opt-in\" to an \"opt-out\" approach to enroll eligible WIC participants \u00bbThis change increased the number of WIC clients participating in the Vouchers4Veggies program - however, clients who did not decide to opt-out but who were less interested in the program received vouchers but did not consistently redeem them. This both created challenges for budgeting how many vouchers to distribute (and how many active participants to maintain in the program) and meant that those participants did not access the fresh and free produce available to them. Distributing Vouchers4Veggies to participants via mail instead of in- person at WIC offices became necessary once shelter-in-place orders were issued. \u00bbMailing vouchers made participating in the voucher program more convenient and safe, allowing the program to reach more low- income pregnant people - yet this also resulted in some vouchers not arriving to their intended recipients (some vouchers were lost in the mail, some participants did not update their address after moving or establish a forwarding address, and some participants did not have reliable access to mail).The Heart of the City Farmers' Market (HOCFM) uses the Healthy Food Purchasing Supplement grant to distribute Market Match incentives/supplements to low-income households that qualify for CalFresh based on income and choose to make a purchase at Heart of the City Farmers' Market using their Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card. This includes seniors and people with disabilities who also receive SSI. During this period, HOCFM also distributed supplements to households who qualify for Pandemic EBT, including families with children between the ages of 0-6. \u00bbMore than 12,378 unduplicated people received Market Match incentives/supplements in fiscal year 2020-2021. This included 6,293 unduplicated people who received supplements supported with SDDT funds, while other supplements were funded by the Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program. 91 SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORTDuring the 2020-2021 fiscal year, EatSF's Vouchers4 Veggies program focused primarily on serving San Francisco residents enrolled in WIC (the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children). In response to shelter-in-place ordered issued in March 2020, WIC offices closed and client services were conducted remotely at the beginning of the 2020-2021 fiscal year. To continue the program, EatSF switched from distributing vouchers in-person to mailing vouchers to low-income pregnant people. \u00bbThe waitlist to participate in EatSF's Vouchers4Veggies program grew to more than 9,000 households in 2020-2021, a testament to the increased demand for this program. \u00bb75% of Vouchers4Veggies distributed were redeemed in 2020-2021 Some community-based organizations that received SDDT funds in May-June 2020 to provide emergency food distributed emergency food early in the 2020-2021 fiscal year, including more than 15,251 grocery bags and 23,982 prepared meals.Grocery bags provided by organization receiving SDDT funds 92 | Finding 3Grocery bags provided by organization receiving SDDT fundsMental Health Resources The economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the impacts that shelter- in-place orders issued to slow transmission of COVID-19 have had on people's relationships and social support, and the cumulative physical and mental health stressors exacerbated by the pandemic have all taken their toll on people's mental health. Although SDDT Healthy Communities grantee BMAGIC was funded primarily to support its work on the ParkRx program for residents of Bayview Hunters Point, the pandemic made it clear how important it is to holistically support community members' health and the program developed a webinar series on \"Normalizing Mental Health.\" This three-part series highlighted healthy coping mechanisms, provided local resources for mental health issues, and modeled the practice of \"naming it to tame it\" by facilitating a conversation about the stigma of mental health issues and accessing mental health services. The final event in the series, a Meet and Greet with a Therapist, was held in-person, with participants signing up for time slots prior to the event.

In addition, BIPOC communities and immigrants are more likely to be working in industries decimated by COVID-19 or in jobs that cannot be done at home. Another major factor affecting the wealth of Black/African American and immigrant communities especially is policing. Black/African American people have been subject to disproportionate arrests, use-of-force, and incarceration, and immigrant communities have faced targeted attacks from the Trump Administration. Ensure low-income school children have access to educational programming The Issue: To adapt to COVID-19, the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) moved to distance learning in March and started the school year in fall 2020 distanced as well. Existing racial and socioeconomic achievement gaps are expected to widen due to disparities in access to computers, home internet connections, the loss of direct instruction from teachers, and/or an inability to financially supplement SFUSD learning plans. Low-income parents are the most likely to report that their kids are doing little or no remote learning in San Francisco. Build technology capacity of new users, small businesses, and nonprofits The Issue: Many of San Francisco's most vulnerable residents lack basic digital literacy skills and require additional support to participate in digital society. Similarly, many small businesses and nonprofits need assistance to navigate unfamiliar technological waters as they seek to pivot their businesses models to survive reduced activity under safe reopening regulations. Without the ability to provide in-person support, alternative means are needed to support residents in finding services online and to support businesses and nonprofits in adjusting their operations.

KEY FINDINGS 4.1: Sales of sugary drinks and youth consumption of sugary drinks in San Francisco have both decreased annually. 4.2: SDDT-supported Healthy Food Purchasing Supplement grantees have demonstrated statistically significant increases in participants' food security and consumption of fruit and vegetables. Data from these grantees are also a reliable proxy for increasing both food security and fruit/vegetable consumption for Market Match participants. 4.3: SDDT funds have been used to create opportunities for physical activity that result in participants being physically active when they would otherwise not be as active or active at all. 4.4: SDDT Healthy Communities grantee SisterWeb has achieved higher rates of breastfeeding among their clients compared to overall rates in San Francisco. 4.5: SDDT funds have been used to support job training and professional development for program participants, increasing their employment options and economic opportunity. 4.6: In addition to helping participating individuals and families stretch their household budget, the Vouchers 4 Veggies program makes significant contributions to the local economy. 100 | Finding 4 Background SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORT 101FINDING 4 Background SDDT revenues are dedicated to funding programs, services, policies, and environmental interventions that result in positive changes\u2014or improved outcomes\u2014that take place over time. Behavior changes usually require less time to achieve than systems changes. However, even for behavior change to be successful, there must be a combination of personal interest in making the change in the behavior as well as a change in the conditions that support or allow the behavior change to take place. Programs, services, policies, and environmental changes are even more complex, and typically require longer periods of time for change to occur, often because these changes involve modifying the systems in which they exist. Given that SF SDDT began distributing funding to organizations and agencies in 2018/2019, we would not yet expect the population-level, longer- term health outcomes and community and economic outcomes to show important changes. We would, however, expect to see data that demonstrate that SDDT funding is contributing to positive changes in shorter-term outcomes and that San Francisco is moving in the right direction toward longer-term outcomes. In fact, organizations and agencies supported by SDDT funds have now begun to demonstrate some success for many of the behavioral outcomes and economic conditions for individual workers/families. Portsmouth Square, Chinatown 102 | Finding 4 Portsmouth Square, Chinatown Notably, no single policy will reduce [sugar-sweetened beverage] consumption to healthy levels, so an integrated policy approach that adapts to changing market and consumption trends; evolving social, political, and public health needs; and emerging science is critical.32The shorter-term outcomes identified in the SDDT evaluation logic model include the following: Improve behavioral outcomes Decrease in sugary drink consumption23 Increase in fruit/vegetable consumption24 Increase in physical activity25 Increase in breastfeeding26 Increase in tap water consumption27 Improve economic conditions for individual workers/families and local businesses Increase in food security28 Increase in economic opportunity and stability29 The longer-term outcomes identified in the SDDT evaluation logic model include the following: Improve community + economic outcomes in priority neighborhoods30 \u00bbIncrease in hiring and economic opportunity Improve health outcomes31 \u00bbDecrease in prevalence of dental caries \u00bbDecrease in prevalence of heart disease \u00bbDecrease in prevalence of hypertension \u00bbDecrease in obesity \u00bbDecrease in prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes \u00bbDecrease in rate of stroke \u00bbDecrease in prevalence and rates of other diet-related chronic diseasesIt is important to remember that existing population-level data sources are not robust reflections of the burden of disease for communities of color in San Francisco (particularly among Black/African Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Asian ethnicities). Additionally, population- level data are usually made available to the public one to three years after they are collected, resulting in a time- lag related to assessing if and how outcome data are changing and to identifying trends. Furthermore, it is not yet possible to account for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding economic insecurity on outcome measures prioritized by the SDDTAC. 23.

There was a statistically significant decrease in the volume of sugar-sweetened beverages purchased in San Francisco, compared to Richmond, California, in the 2 years after the Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax (SDDT) was implemented. There were no statistically significant changes in purchases of untaxed beverages or sweet snacks following implementation of the SDDT. Additionally, there was no statistically significant change in purchases of sugar-sweetened beverages in neighboring areas (within 3 miles of San Francisco), compared with neighboring areas of Richmond, after the SDDT was implemented Because there has been a decrease in sugary drink consumption in San Francisco, the tax collected from sugary drink distributors in San Francisco decreased again from prior years, totaling $10.4 million in 2020-2021. Total Sugary Drinks Distributor Tax Collected Per Fiscal Year $7,911,731$16,097,908 $13,181,608 $10,435,241 Jan 1-Jun 30, 2018 Jul 1, 2018- 30, 2019Jul 1, 2019- Jun 30, 2020Jul 1, 2020- Jun 30, 2021 20% 50% 33. This research was conducted by Justin White and Dean Schillinger at the University of California, San Francisco, Sofia Villas-Boas and Kristine Madsen at the University of California, Berkeley, Scott Kaplan at the U.S. Naval Academy, and Sanjay Basu at Waymark Health. These findings have been submitted to a journal for publication and were in the peer-review process when this evaluation report was finalized in February 2022. Following SDDT implementation, the volume of sugar- sweetened beverages purchased in San Francisco declined by more than 20% compared to Richmond, California. Purchases of sugar-sweetened beverages at supermarkets in San Francisco decreased by more than 50%! SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORT 105The Madsen Research Group at the University of California at Berkeley's School of Public Health conducted a repeated cross-sectional study of sugar- sweetened beverage consumption among youth in San Francisco between 2015 and 2019.34 This study surveyed 7th-10th graders attending San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD), achieving a diverse sample of 31,396 student surveys. Half (50%) of students in the sample identified as Asian, 22% as Latinx, 14% as multiethnic or other, 11% as White, and 4% as Black. Students were asked how often they drank different kinds of beverages, and all responses were converted to a number of times per day students consumed each kind of beverage. 34. Altman, E. et al.

Most of these increases were not statistically significant\u2014the only significant increase in consumption was of sports drinks. At the same time, the frequency of youth consuming soda and sports drinks has both been lower and decreased more rapidly in San Francisco compared to youth in California overall. Black students in 7th-10th grade in SFUSD reported the largest increase in consumption of sugary beverages between 2018 and 2019 in addition to already consuming sugary beverages more frequently than their peers in other racial/ethnic groups.35 35.

To engage community members who have not been physically active before in their lives is often very challenging, but a number of SDDT funded programs have found effective ways to do this. The Requity program provided 2,188 scholarships to participate in San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department programming in 2020-2021, with 467 scholarships used by participants who pre- registered (i.e., did not attend a drop-in event or class). The vast majority of scholarship recipients (75%) who registered for classes participated in multiple programs throughout the year. Between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021, Requity staff organized more than 229 programming events and more than 652 hours of programming.Requity 2020-2021 Scholarship Recipients by Age GroupShort-term SDDT Outcome: Increase in physical activity 145 529 432 209 82 37 286 81 3700-4 years old 5-9 years old 10-13 years old 14-17 years old 18-24 years old 25-39 years old 40-54 years old 55 years or older Age not recorded2,188 2020-2021, 2,188 SisterWeb has achieved higher rates of breastfeeding among their clients compared to overall rates in San Francisco.

This analysis assessed the economic impacts for each program included in the study, using the most current data available when the study began (2018 data for Vouchers 4 Veggies). During 2018, Vouchers 4 Veggies provided $458,000 in incentives that were spent in San Francisco: $164,000 used at farmers' markets, farm stands, or community-supported agriculture (CSAs) and $294,000 at brick and mortar food retailers. In just 2018, this was estimated as contributing $958,000 to California's economy, including 5.4 jobs and $284,000 in labor income. \u00bbEvery $1.00 of Vouchers 4 Veggies used for direct sales with farmers contributed $3.90 to the local economy, while $1.00 used at food retailers contributed $1.60 to the local economy. Overall, each dollar of Vouchers 4 Veggies generates $2.10 or more for the local economy.Every $1 spent on the Vouchers4Veggies program contributes the local economy! $1.00 $2.10Short-term SDDT Outcome: Increase in SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORT 115City HallIncrease community input into decision making related to tax allocation. Consider incorporating participatory budgeting as part of the process of making funding decisions. Increase culturally responsive awareness/educational campaigns about SDDT. Educational campaigns should focus on why the tax is important, as well as the purpose and uses of SDDT funds to ensure that those communities most impacted by the SSB industry have access to this information. Campaigns should be most visible and widespread where low-income communities of color live. Create ongoing community engagement opportunities related to SDDT to 1) increase transparency about SDDT allocation and effects of funds; 2) share evaluation findings and recommendations with community members; 3) gather community feedback and input about evaluation findings and recommendations; 4) gather community input related to funding allocation. While community meetings with impacted communities were facilitated in 2018-2019 to inform the initial work of the SDDTAC, they should continue to take place annually. Extend the SDDTAC beyond 2028 and add more youth seats to ensure young people are able to participate in decision making in SF. Supports capacity building and leadership development among young people. Offer a stipend for youth seats. Establish a robust onboarding and orientation process for all SDDTAC members. Provide new SDDTAC members with information about the soda tax as well as information about their role in developing recommendations for the Mayor and about San Francisco's budgeting process. 1 2 3 4 5Recommendations 116 The SF SDDTAC should continue to identify funding recommendations that align with the SF SDDTAC values . The values identified by the SF SDDTAC have informed funding recommendations that focus on organizations and agencies that engage communities most burdened by inequities. Other SDDT advisory bodies across the nation could also benefit from articulating key values to inform funding recommendations. Given the success demonstrated in SF from funding recommendations that align with values and implement strategies, SDDT advisory bodies across the US could also benefit from articulating values to inform funding recommendations. Continue to rely on organizations and agencies that work directly with marginalized communities in SF to identify and meet emerging needs (like those identified and addressed during the COVID-19 pandemic). Focus health messaging on the negative health impacts of all sugary drinks, including sports drinks, fruit drinks, and bubble tea/ boba, given that SF community members are drinking slightly less soda since 2016. 6 7 8 9 BMAGIC and Park Rx Event 117 SDDT 2020-2021 EVALUATION REPORTSan Francisco Sugary Drinks Tax (SDDT) EVALUATION REPORT 2020 -2021 SodaTax-SF.org SFdph.org/sddtac31 Appendi x C C.
