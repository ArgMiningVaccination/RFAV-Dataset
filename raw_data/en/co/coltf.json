PARIS CARDIOVASCULAR RESEARCH CENTER ANNUAL REPORT 2019-2021 PARCC: PARIS CARDIO VASCULAR RESEARCH CENTER The PARis Cardiovascular research Center (PARCC) is dedicated to experimental disease-oriented research and has as primary aim to catalyze the production of basic knowledge related to understanding the cellular and molecular basis of cardiovascular disease. 2005 Construction begins at the HEGP site, on a new research center dedicated principally to cardiovas-cular sciences. 2007 Nomination of Alain Tedgui, Inserm Director of research, as first director of the new Research Center. 2009 Official creation by Inserm and the Universit\u00e9 de Paris of the PARCC : the PARis- Cardiovascular research Center. Official grand opening in the presence of the minister for Research and Higher Education and the minister of Health. 6 teams + 1 AVENIR team2010 First visit of the international Scientific Advisory Board (SAB). 8 teams + 2 AVENIR team. 2014 Re-appointment of Alain Tedgui as Director for a second term. 13 teams + 1 AVENIR team 2019 Nomination of Chantal Boulanger as the new Director. 12 teams + 1 AVENIR team 2021 Fifth SAB visit. The PARCC was created at the H\u00f4pital europ\u00e9en Georges-Pompidou (HEGP) on January 1st, 2009 under the leadership of Alain Tedgui. Led by Chantal Boulanger for the term 2019 - 2024, the PARCC brings together a multi-disciplinary group of more than 320 basic and clinical scientists, as well as professional technical and administrative staff and research trainees, organized into 13 teams, including 1 AVENIR group and 2 ERC grantees. Our main mission is to provide an optimal scientific and medical environment for basic and translational cardiovascular research and training. PARCC team leaders, as well as senior researchers, are inter-nationally recognized experts in their respective fields, and together have forged the reputation of the PARCC as a national and international leader in cardiovascular research. PARCC research ranges from basic molecular and cellular biology to integrated physiology and patho-physiology, biomarkers, genetics and epidemiology, with the goal of understanding\u2014 at a detailed and mechanistic level\u2014 disease processes in athero-sclerosis, angiogenesis, hypertension, heart failure and sudden cardiac death, and developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Translational research is an integral part of the mission of the PARCC, which operates in close connection with clinical laboratories and departments of the adjoin-ing HEGP hospital.The PARCC has developed and established technology platforms cutting-edge methodologies for con-ducting basic, pre-clinical and translational research: in vitro and in vivo experimental models, small- and large-animal housing facilities, histology, integrative biology, flow cytometry, biomarkers and imaging platforms, management of biostatistics, biobanks and cohorts,.... These tools allow the PARCC to optimize its translational research potential in the rapidly moving areas of cardiovascular sciences and medicine. Understanding the mechanisms of cardiovascular disease processes ultimately leads to therapeutical intervention, and requires interdisciplinary efforts. The PARCC connects investigators in a wide spectrum of cardiovascular research that includes molecular and cellular investigations, physio(patho)logical experimen-tation in whole animals, investigator-initiated clinical research, population studies, and translational research that brings discoveries from the bench to the bedside. The PARCC fosters an environment of intellectual and thematic diversity that embraces talents in vas-cular biology and atherosclerosis (Hafid Hulot), in order to tackle unmet medical needs in cardiovascular diseases. Our strategy is multifaceted, founded upon the exper- tise of PARCC teams in basic and clinical translational research, including their initiation of and participation in international collaborations, as well as upon strong interactions with the clinical departments at the HEGP hospital (cardiology, cardiovascular prevention, hyper-tension, medicine, genetics, cardiac and vascular sur - gery....) and the HEGP Clinical Investigation Center.

She has authored more than 50 scientific publications since 2005, in int ernationally renowned journals such as Cell Metabolism, Circulation and Nature Medicine, as las t author. She did her PhD on metabolic syndrome with Karine Cl\u00e9ment and then joined Ziad Mallat in 2006 to study the immune-inflammatory response in cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis. Over the last ten years, she laid the gr oundwork for a new research area concerning metabolism, inflammation and microbiota in obesity and atherosclerosis. She also serves as a member of national cardiovascular committees (NSFA and F ondation de France). RESEARCH Soraya Taleb's research integrates studies using mouse models and translational aspects in humans to improve pathophysiology understanding of cardiovascular dis-eases. She is also interested in comorbidities including obesity, frequently associated with cardiovascular dis-eases and questions how these comorbidities impact on vascular diseases. In particular, she has recently focused her studies on the enzyme indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO), a rate-limiting enzyme induced during inflammation, which catalyses the degradation of tryptophan (Trp) towards kynurenine (Kyn) pathway. We demonstrated that obesity was associated with an increase in IDO activity (as assessed by Kyn/Trp ratio) in the intestine and a decrease in production of IL-22, which has beneficial effects on the intestinal mucosa. IDO deletion or inhibition improved metabolic parameters through shifting Trp metabolism towards a microbiota-dependent production of protective indoles and IL-22. We have thus identified a novel function of IDO in the fine tuning of intestinal Trp metabolism with major consequences on microbiota-dependent control of metabolic disease. Most recently, and in collaboration with another PARCC team, we revealed that IDO was a major regulator of cardiac homeostasis. Distinct loss of function of IDO in different cell types revealed the importance of its expression in endothelial cells in cardiac remodeling and function. Our study provided novel insights into the complex cross-talk between the cardiac endothe - lial cells and cardiomyocytes during cardiac repair after myocardial infarction.SELECTED PUBLICATIONS Melhem NJ, Chajadine M, Gomez I, Howangyin Bouvet M, Knosp C, Sun Y, Rouanet Chajadine S, Esposito B, Tavitian B, Callebert J, Luquet S.

Deletion of MARIJON TEAM 04 Eloi Marijon is Professor of Cardiology at the Universit\u00e9 de Paris , Head of the Cardiac Electrophysiology Section at the H\u00f4pital europ\u00e9en Georges-Pompidou , and codirector the Paris- Sudden Death Expertise Center (SDEC). Eloi Marijon is also part of the PaRis Artificial Intelligence Research InstitutE, Principal Investigator of the DAI-PP Consortium, and Chair of the Lancet Commission on Sudden Cardiac Death, heading an international Task Force on SCD. He is member of the Institut Universitaire de France since 2017. Eloi Marijon is also in volved in various Global Health initiatives aiming to develop research, care and teaching in developing countries. Over the last ten years, Eloi Marijon has authored more than 300 peer-reviewed publications in high-impact international journals, and several book chapters.OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTIONS RESEARCH Eloi Marijon's main research focus has been on sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) which represents the major form of cardiac mortality costing millions of lives worldwide every year. Given its abruptness and high fatality rate, SCA affords very limited opportunity to intervene after the fact. Hence strategies to combat SCA have focused on trying to identify early, the individual likely to experience SCA. However, this strategy of long-term prevention, mainly based on implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) insertion in the vulnerable subject - suffers from key limitations, including poor identification of high-risk subjects and an imperfect technology in the form of the ICD, with a significant rate of complications. Through the Paris-SDEC, using a multi-disciplinary approach incorporating population science, clinical and basic sciences, we have worked to improve the prediction and identification of subjects most likely to develop SCA in the general population as well as in specific high-risk groups. In parallel, improving SCA outcomes is also a target through improved resusci-tation and other measures. We are also pioneering an alternative approach of near-term prevention, which aims to pre-empt SCA in the hours and minutes pre-ceding the event by incorporating warning symptoms and dynamic monitoring. Newer digital data acquisition techniques, interconnected device transfer and artificial intelligence can enable dynamic, real-time monitoring of diverse parameters, thereby permitting timely iden-tification of the subject about to experience an SCA event. This in turn will allow rapid action through novel avenues such as instant geo-localization and drone-as-sisted interventions. More recently, we investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the Great Paris Area, demonstrating a major surge in SCD during the first, but not the second wave, thus highlighting the importance of anticipation, preparedness and planning in the management of public health crises.

He studied chemistry and biophysics at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Paris. He holds a PhD in cell biology from Universit\u00e9 Paris- Diderot on studying the function of FOXL2, a master transcrip-tional regulator of ovarian devel-opment and function. He later worked on the links between the Mediator complex, a major regulator of transcription, and DNA repair. Adrien Georges joined the team of Nabila Bouatia-Naji in the PARCC as an ERC post-doc in 2017 to work on the genetic basis of complex cardiovascular diseases. In 2021, he was recruited as an Inserm research associate (CRCN). He has two young daughters. RESEARCH AND PERSPECTIVES Adrien Georges uses state-of-the art approaches in genomics and cell biology, such as genome editing using CRISPR-Cas9 and cell differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells, to analyze the molecular mech-anisms at disease associated genetic loci. He recently used this strategy to identify potential target genes at genetic risk loci for mitral valve prolapse, a common valve disease potentially leading to heart failure. Adrien Georges main focus is on elucidating the role of transcription regulation in the genetic basis of fibromus - cular dysplasia (FMD) and spontaneous FMD and SCAD are underdiagnosed vascular diseases affecting primarily young and mid-dle-aged women, which may lead to life-threatening complications such as aneurysm, stroke or myocardial infarction. The mechanisms and risk factors of these diseases are currently unknown. As part of ERC ROSALIND project, Adrien Georges stud- ied the genetic basis of FMD and SCAD using genome-wide approaches such as exome-sequencing, genome-wide association studies and epigenomic approaches, leading to the identification of the first susceptibility genes to FMD. Genetic analyses established that FMD and SCAD share part of their complex genetic basis with common diseases such as migraine, hypertension or coronary artery disease. Adrien Georges will in particular focus his research in understanding how the regulation of smooth muscle contraction and physiology may par-ticipate to the pathogenesis of these diseases. St\u00e9phane Camus is a multidisci-plinary researcher with an exper-tise at the crossroads between basic cell biology and cardiovas-cular pathophysiology. Freshly recruited as an Inserm researcher (CRCN) in Team 6 in 2021, St\u00e9phane is developing a research axis aiming at unraveling the intra-cellular mechanisms underlying cardiovascular diseases, with a particular emphasis on the immunomodulatory role of macrophages in the remodeling of the infarcted heart. RESEARCH AND PERSPECTIVES St\u00e9phane Camus began his scientific journey with a PhD in vascular biology, during which he highlighted the pathophysiologic role of erythrocyte-derived large extracellular vesicles in the onset of vaso-occlusive cri-ses in sickle cell disease. He then joined the lab of Frances Brodsky (UCSF, USA & UCL, UK) to study clathrin-mediated intracellular mem-brane traffic pathways and regulated secretion systems. More St\u00e9phane focused on the human-spe-cific clathrin heavy chain CHC22 and uncovered a novel traffic pathway that is essential for conferring insulin sensitivity to skeletal myocytes and therefore glucose homeostasis in humans. Being awarded a Marie Curie European fellowship, St\u00e9phane joined the Silvestre lab to tackle major out-standing issues in cardiovascular pathophysiology. With a particular focus on the role of macrophages in the remodeling of the infarcted heart, St\u00e9phane' research is geared toward unraveling the intracellular mechanisms that confer macrophages with their unique ability con-trol inflammation and orchestrate the successful remod-eling of the infarcted heart. The strategic combination of St\u00e9phane' multidiscipli- narity with the renowned expertise of the Silvestre lab in inflammation and post-ischemic cardiac remodel-ing, and the outstanding scientific and technological environment of the PARCC, a leading research institute dedicated to fighting cardiovascular diseases, creates the perfect recipe for an exciting and impactful research.The fifth edition of the Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) visit to PARCC took place on June 14 and 15, 2021. Organized this year by videoconference due to the health situation around the world, this event was an oppor-tunity for PARCC's scientific teams to present their past, current and future work. The center virtually welcomed its External Scientific Council composed of 9 members from Europe and the USA. This visit allowed to reflect on the scientific orientations of the PARCC and the different teams, in order to reflect on the next program project 2025-2030.

EVs s temming from cellular membrane can signal to neighboring cells and influence disease progression or repair mechanisms. They also present an attractive potential as a new plasma marker to stratify cardiovascular risk. In addition, plasma EVs isolated from patients with vascular diseases can transfer their cargos to endothelial cells, and contribute to vascular dysregulation. We also further characterized EVs to better understand their role in cell-cell communication, in particular in the heart after myocardial infarction where they stimulate infiltrating monocytes, therefore contributing to the repair response in ischemic diseases. RESEARCH PROJECTS Cardiac EVs, regulators of inflammation in myocardial infarction Xavier Loyer & Boulanger EVs of endothelial and car-diomyocyte origin regulate intra-cardiac and remote inflammatory responses after myocardial infarction and in diabetes, and in particular the role of non-coding RNA transfer to target cells. Our objectives are to better characterize the protein and non-coding RNA cargos of cardiomyocyte-derived EVs, track them into the circula-tion and identify their biodistribution in vivo in order to understand how EVs regulate the inflammatory process after myocardial infarction. Red blood cell EVs in hemolytic disorders Olivier Blanc-Brude Diseases associated with intravascular hemolysis, such as sickle cell disease, are characterized by dysfunctional plasma annexins, resulting in abnormal EV numbers and composition, with increased procoagulant activity. Our objectives are to determine the molecular determinants of annexin inhibition during hemolysis, better under - stand the pathophysiological significance of EVs, and develop new EV inhibitors with our industrial and atherosclerosis Chantal Boulanger & Xavier to explore how endo- thelial autophagy affects EV release, composition and fate in atheroprone areas of the vasculature and b) to test the hypothesis that stimulation of autophagic flux may constitute an attractive therapeutic strategy in atherosclerosis. HIGHLIGHTS Erythrocyte-derived Clin Invest. 2020;130(5):2630-2643. Arterial cardiovascular events are the leading cause of death in patients with JAK2V617F myeloproliferative neo- plasms. However, their mechanisms are poorly under-stood. The high prevalence of myocardial infarction without significant coronary stenosis or atherosclerosis in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms suggests that vascular function is altered. However, the conse - quences of JAK2V617F mutation on vascular reactivity are unknown. Arteries from Jak2V617F mice were characterized by an increased response to vasoconstrictors resulting from a disturbed endothelial NO pathway and increased endo-thelial oxidative stress. This response was reproduced in wild-type mice by circulating large EVs isolated from patients carrying JAK2V617F and by erythrocyte-derived EVs from transgenic mice. Vesicles of other cellular ori-gins had no effect. This effect was observed ex vivo on isolated aortas, but also in vivo on femoral arteries. Proteomic analysis of large EVs derived from JAK2V617F erythrocytes identified increased expression of myelop-eroxidase as the likely mechanism accounting for their Chantal M.

Intra-cardiac release of extracellular vesicles shapes inflammation following myocardial Circ Res. 2018;123:100-106. Acute myocardial infarction induces a rapid and massive influx of inflammatory cells into ischemic areas, result - ing in the release of soluble chemokines, cytokines and growth factors. In murine models of myocardial infarction, these inflammatory cells have been shown to modulate post-infarction cardiac remodeling and function. Extracellular vesicle (EVs) release into the interstitial space regulates important biological functions, includ-ing inflammation, which influence the development of cardiovascular diseases. Culture cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts also release EVs in vitro. However, we lack in vivo evidence of such phenomenon in the heart, in particular following myocardial infarction. The present study therefore tested the hypothesis that local gen-eration of EVs in the infarcted heart regulates cardiac inflammation following myocardial infarction. We observed in mice that coronary artery ligation transiently increases large and small EV levels, when compared to sham animals. Vesicles of similar diameter were also isolated from interventricular septum frag-ments obtained from patients undergoing extracorpo-real circulation for aortic valve replacement. Vesicles locally generated after myocardial infarction originated mainly from endothelial cells and from cardiomyocytes. Large EVs were preferentially taken up by infiltrating monocytes, where they caused an increased release of chemokines and inflammatory cytokines, whereas small EVs and EVs isolated from sham animals were without effects. Taken altogether, these results highlight the paracrine crosstalk between cardiac inflammatory cells and infarction. Xavier LOYER, CR Inserm, joined Inserm as a junior scientist in 2014.

We run preclinical computed tomography (CT), ultrafast ultrasound imaging (UUS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI and positron emission tomography (PET), and clinical CT, UUS, MRI, PET). RESEARCH PROJECTS IMAGE-GUIDED MINI-INVASIVE THERAPY (see also highlight 1) Offering the safety and logistic advantages of cell-free biotherapy, Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) derived from stem/stromal cells (SCs), are promising for regenerative medicine to promote tissue healing. We administered locally SC EVs embedded in a thermoresponsive gel, as a therapeutic strategy for managing post-surgical fistulas in a swine fistula model. This combination resulted in significant (i) reduction of fibrosis, (ii) decline of inflam-matory response, (iii) decrease in myofibroblasts density, and (iv) increased angiogenesis. Our results present prospects for EV administration strategies and for the management of post-operative fistulas.

It concerns about 50% of patients with heart failure and so far, treatments have not shown any therapeutic benefit. The PACIFIC project aims to evaluate several imag- ing biomarkers, in order to improve the classification of HFpEF and to bet-ter understand the phenotypic hetero-geneity and evaluate new therapeutic approaches. Cancer and Radiomics Recent developments in artificial intelligence applied to medical images accelerate biomarker discovery. Our team focuses on radiomics, the high throughput extraction of a large number of imaging features with no a priori hypothesis, applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to select the most clinically relevant imaging biomarkers. We used radiomics to pre-dict malignancy in orbital tumors (Duron et al, Invest Radiol 2020), patient outcome in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and HPV status in head and neck cancers. We pay special attention to methodological issues such as the added information using multiple sequences in MRI (Lecler et al, Sci Rep 2019) and to the impact of image processing (Duron et al, PLoS One 2019).

In preclinical studies, we have demonstrated the benefits of PETRUS in studying the interaction between tumor metabolism and vascular progression (Facchin et al. Theranostics , 2020). The complementarity of the performance and nature of information of each modality is excellent and allows to correct for blurring of cardiac PET images due to the motion of the heart (Perez-Liva et al.

The HYPERALDO Trial With the department of Hypertension of the H\u00f4pital europ\u00e9en Georges-Pompidou , we studied the respective effects of aldosterone and blood pressure (BP) levels on myocardial fibrosis in humans by using cardiac MR and new technology to assess interstitial myocardial fibrosis. The study included 20 patients with primary aldostero- nism (PA) (high aldosterone and high BP), 20 patients with essential hypertension (HTN) (average aldosterone and high BP), 20 patients with secondary aldostero-nism due to Bartter/Gitelman (BG) syndrome (high aldosterone and normal BP), and 20 healthy subjects (HS) (normal aldosterone and normal BP). The ain outcome was that only primary pathological aldoste-rone excess combined with high BP increased both extracellular myocardial matrix and intracellular mass. Secondary aldosterone excess with normal BP did not affect extracellular myocardial matrix (Mousseaux et al.

Through recruitments mainly at the HTN Department and the National Reference Centre for Rare Vascular Diseases, H\u00f4pital europ\u00e9en Georges-Pompidou , we have access to large cohorts of patients for several rare arterial diseases mainly, vascular Ehlers Danlos and non-syndromic mitral prolapse (MVP). lab is also coordinating large collaborative efforts for FMD and spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), an atypical acute coronary syndrome associated with FMD. We have access to the largest existing genetic data for these atypical and female-specific arterial diseases. We investigate genes involved in the regulation of blood pressure and vascular tone, specifically the WNK pathway, COL3A1 and a growing number of newly identified genes located in risk loci are atypical cardiovascular diseases with higher prevalence among middle-aged women who present few cardiovascular risk factors. MVP is a common cause of valve repair to prevent arrhythmias and sudden death. We aim to deciphering the genetic causes of FMD, SCAD and MVP using genome-wide association studies that we apply to case control studies. We also define chro-matin accessibility and gene expression in arterial and valve cells and tissues. We use (ATAC-Seq, RNA-Seq), CRISPR-Cas9 engi-neered cels, including iPSCs induced cells. Our aim is to tie genetic variation at risk loci to function relevant to biological mechanisms of arterial and valve integrity.

We aimed to test the association between rs9349379 genotype and SCAD. Case control studies from France, UK, USA and Australia were analyzed to test the association with SCAD risk. The previously reported risk allele for FMD (rs9349379-A) was associated with a higher risk of SCAD in all studies. In a meta-analysis totaling 1,055 SCAD patients and 7,190 controls the odds was 1.67 (95% CI: 1.50-1.86) per copy of rs9349379-A. In a subset of 491 SCAD patients, we found that the OR estimate was higher for the association with SCAD in patients without FMD (OR=1.89, 95%CI=1.53; cases 95%CI=1.28; 1.99). Importantly, the association with SCAD in in opposite direction to the association of this same genetic variant in CAD, a more men-dominated form of ACS. In sum-mary, we identified the first genetic risk factor for SCAD in the largest study conducted so far for this neglected ACS. This genetic link may contribute to the clinical overlap between SCAD and FMD. Kyryachenko et al. Circulation Research. 2021;128:e84-e101.

Using Ultrafast Doppler, UItrafastecho and Shear wave imaging, he has developed with ESPCI investigators new research on arterial plus wave velocity, arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis plaque biomechanics. Their collaboration continues on the cardiac function evaluation using elastography and shear wave imaging for myocardial stiffness evaluation. He funded Cardiawave which developed a break - through disruptive technology on non-invasive ultrasound therapy creating shockwave on the calcification of the aortic valve of patient with severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis.

SENIOR SCIENTIST Compared to the heart and cardiac fibroblasts, we found that MV-specific The most enriched motif in MV-specific open chromatin peaks was for the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATC) family of transcription fac-tors, involved in valve endocardial and interstitial cells formation. We also found that MVP-associated variants were significantly enriched (p<0.05) in mitral valve open chromatin peaks. Integration of the ATAC-Seq data with GWAS risk loci, extensive functional annotation, and gene reporter assay suggest plausible causal variants for rs2641440 at and rs6723013 at TNS1 locus. CRISPR-Cas9 the sequence including rs6723013 in human fibroblasts correlated with increased expression only for TNS1. 4C-Seq experiments provided evidence for several tar- get genes, SRR, HIC1, and DPH1 at the SMG6/ SRR locus and further supported TNS1 as the most likely target gene on Chr2. Here we describe unprecedented genome-wide open chromatin profiles from human MVs and report specific gene regulation profiles, compared to the heart. We aldso provide in vitro functional evi- dence for potential causal variants and target genes at MVP loci involving established and new biological mechanisms. Louis-Dit-Picard et al. J Clin Invest. 2020;130(12):6379-6394. Gain-of-function mutations in with no lysine (K) 1 (WNK1) and WNK4 genes are responsible for famil- ial hyperkalemic hypertension (FHHt), a rare, inherited disorder characterized by arterial hypertension and hyperkalemia with metabolic acidosis. More (KLHL3-CUL3) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex have shed light on the importance of WNK's cellular degradation on renal ion transport. Using full exome sequencing for a 4-generation family and then targeted sequencing in other suspected cases, we have identified new missense variants in the WNK1 gene clustering in the short conserved acidic motif known to interact with the KLHL3-CUL3 ubiquitin com-plex. Affected subjects had an early onset of a hyper-kalemic hyperchloremic phenotype, but normal blood pressure values. Functional experiments in Xenopus lae - vis oocytes and HEK293T cells demonstrated that these mutations strongly decrease the ubiquitination of the kidney-specific isoform KS-WNK1 by the KLHL3-CUL3 complex rather than the long ubiquitous catalytically active L-WNK1 isoform.

For that purpose, we are developing integrative epidemiology around 4 main axes: Module 1: Sudden death in the population. The Paris Sudden Death Expertise Center Module 2: Novel determinants of cardiovascular diseases. The Paris Prospective Study 3 Module 3: Global Health: Epidemiology of cardiovascular diseases in developing countries Module 4: Heart transplantation: The Paris Transplant Group RESEARCH PROJECTS Sudden death in the population Eloi Marijon, Florence Dumas, Alain Cariou, Patricia Empana & Xavier Jouven An optimal approach to the overall problem of sudden cardiac death (SCD) has to encompass multiple facets of this condition including risk stratification prior to the event, strategies to improve survival, ongoing support to survivors in terms of quality of life and psychosocial support as well as risk assessment among family mem-bers of afflicted individuals. Recognizing the need for a multidimensional strategy to address all the aforemen-tioned issues in SCD, we advocated on May 15 th, 2011 the creation of the Paris-Sudden Death Expertise Center (Paris-SDEC) to set up a specific multidisciplinary col-laboration, linking the community, pre-hospital emer-gency medical services, and in-hospital expertise, and developing three main axes: Patient Care, Education and Research. In terms of research, we are studying SCD in the general population through different epidemiology tools: cohort studies (PPS III, DAI-PP, DAI-T4F among others), as well as case/control and cross-sectional approaches (SDEC Registry in the Great Paris Area). A specific focus has been identified in the development of new preventive strategies using big data and artificial intelligence to actually improve risk prediction. Novel determinants of cardiovascular diseases Jean-Philippe predictive value for CVD events of vascular ageing biomarkers using the Paris Prospective study III, a community-based prospective cohort of 10,157 volunteers followed over 10 years and who underwent a high precision echo-tracking between 2008 and 2012. In particular, we were able to identify patterns of vascular ageing biomarkers that differen-tially predict CVD onset. We have studied the clinical relevance of primordial prevention, a novel approach for the prevention of CVD, aiming to prevent the onset of risk factors in the first place. In 2 papers published in JAMA in 2018, we have examined the clinical relevance of primordial prevention for incident CVD events but also beyond CVD outcomes including dementia and cognitive decline.

We have finalized the 5-year follow-up visit of the CADRE study, a multina-tional cohort of 4300 patients with sickell cell diseases in 5 Sub-Saharan African countries and are currently describ-ing the clinical course and the identification of predictive factors of mortality and vascular complications. We have also reached the 5 years follow-up of the FEVRIER study that aims to examine the patterns of risk factors among patients hospitalized in cardiology departments in 15 Subsaharian countries. In a perspective paper, we have given our view on how the young demographic structure of the African population combined with longstanding local expertise gathered from previous outbreaks and climate conditions could influence favorably COVID-19 spread in African countries despite recognized weakness in the health care systems. Heart transplantation Jean-Philippe Empana, Xavier Jouven & Alexandre Loupy This is an emerging topic conducted in collaboration with Team 11 (A Loupy) and the international network Paris Transplant Group. Using an integrative approach, the general objective is to identify significant deter-minants of the prognosis after heart transplant. By combining clinical, histopathologic and immunolog-ical biomarkers data available at regular time inter-vals in a multicentre study of 1301 patients, we have discriminated 4 trajectories of cardiac allograft vas-culopathies after heart transplantation that are charac-terized by specific determinants and prognosis.HIGHLIGHTS Association of change in cardiovascular health and incident cardiovascular disease events Van Sloten et al. JAMA. 2018;320:1793-1804. Using longitudinal data from the well-known Whitehall II study in UK, we examined for the first time the distri-bution of change in cardiovascular health (CVH) (non-smoking; and ideal levels of body mass index, physical activity, diet, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, and total cholesterol) and the CVD incidence associated with these changes. Only 13% improved their CVH, mostly from low to moderate status, almost 60% had a stable CVH mostly at moderate level, and nearly 30% wors-ened their CVH. Further, change in CVH categories was related to incident CVD (see figure below). These find-ings highlight that there remains room for improvement in CVH status and that both baseline but also change in CVH impacts on CVD incidence.

Our group is interested in the study and modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses during atherosclerosis development, post-ischemic cardiac remodeling and aortic aneurysm formation. Furthermore, we are interested in the interplay between cardiovascular diseases and their associated co-morbidities, and more particularly, the mechanisms involved in the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome in the context of high fat diet. RESEARCH PROJECTS Trained immunity in cardiometabolic diseases Hafid Ait-Oufella, Ziad Mallat & Soraya Taleb Immune cells can retain the memory of an encoun-ter with bacteria or oxidized lipids and this memory called \"trained immunity\" has a lasting effect on their functions. The objective of this new project is to bet-ter understand the phenomenon of trained immunity applied to experimental cardiometabolic diseases and to dissect its cellular and molecular mechanisms. Targeting cytotoxic immune cells in post-ischemic cardiac remodeling Hafid Ait-Oufella We aim to investigate with unique genetically-modified mouse models the role of NK cells, which infiltrate the heart in the context of myocardial infarction and release large amounts of cytotoxic Perforin/Granzyme B. Intestinal cell metabolism and the control of cardio- vascular diseases Soraya Taleb The gut microbiota may modulate cardiometabolic diseases but the mechanisms that link both gut and vascular compartments remains poorly understood. We aim to study the role of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1 activity as well as derived metabolites in intestinal cell metabolism, gut microbiota, and cardiovascular diseases. HIGHLIGHTS Genetic deficiency of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase promotes gut microbiota-mediated metabolic health Laurans L et al. Nat Med. 2018. Indoleamine 2-3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO) is a rate-limiting enzyme induced during inflammation, and catalyses the degradation of tryptophan (Trp) towards kynurenine (Kyn) pathway. We show in high fat diet-induced obesity mouse model, that IDO deletion or inhibition improves metabolic parameters through shifting Trp metabolism towards a microbiota-dependent production of protec-tive indoles and IL-22. Accordingly, obese and type 2 diabetic patients exhibit high Kyn and low indole levels in their feces in comparison to non-obese individuals. We thus identify a novel function of IDO in the fine tuning of intestinal Trp metabolism with major conse-quences on microbiota-dependent control of metabolic disease (Figure 1). Endothelial cell indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase cardiac function infarc-tion through kynurenine Melhem et al. Circulation. 2021. We showed that kynurenine generation through IDO is markedly induced after experimental myocardial infarc-tion in mice.

TREM-1 orchestrates et al. J Clin Invest. 2021. We found that in a mouse model of Angiotensin (Ang) II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) that TREM-1 expression was induced in circulating mono-cytes and infiltrating aortic macrophages through AngII Receptor Type I signaling. Trem1 gene deletion (Apoe-/-Trem1-/-), as well as TREM-1 pharmacological blockade limited both AAA development and severity. Trem1 gene deletion atten-uated the inflammatory response in the aorta, reduced through and aggravated AAA severity. In human AAA, TREM-1 was detected in the aortic wall as well as in the plasma. TREM-1 is involved in AAA pathophysiology and may rep-resent a promising therapeutic target in human (Figure 2).Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells promote granzyme B-dependent adverse post-ischemic cardiac remodeling Santos-Zas et al. Nat Commun. 2021. We showed that following acute myocardial infarction in mice, CD8+ T lymphocytes are recruited and activated in the ischemic heart tissue, and release Granzyme B leading to cardiomyocyte apoptosis, adverse ventricular remodeling and deterioration of myocardial function. Depletion of CD8+ T lymphocytes protects against del-eterious remodeling both in mice and in pig. Elevated circulating levels of Granzyme B in patients with acute myocardial infarction predict increase risk of death at 1-year follow-up. Our work unravels a deleterious role of CD8+ T lymphocytes following acute ischemia, opening potential immuno-modulatory therapeutic strategies.

The overall objective is thus to contribute to the burgeoning field of regenerative medicine, where involved disciplines (e.g. cell biology, tissue engineering, immunology, regulation ) are often partitioned, by a cross-fertilization of expertise within the same team and allow to both improve basic knowledge and clinical applications. RESEARCH PROJECTS Team 06 main objectives are to decode the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in cardiac repair after injury and to develop efficient therapeutic approaches to circumvent cardiac dysfunction occurring in patients with cardiovascular diseases. In particular, we will: 1) decipher the mechanisms of cardiac repair with a spe- cific interest on the interface between inflammatory cells and cardiac repair including cardiac regeneration and tissue remodeling; 2) dev elop extracellular membrane vesicles-based thera- peutic approaches for patients with cardiac diseases. Our preliminary results regarding the use of extracel - lular membrane vesicles purified from iPSC-derived cardiovascular progenitors prompt us to develop a preclinical and translational program targeted at a phase I trial of these extracellular membrane vesi - cles in patients with severe heart failure who have exhausted conventional therapeutic options.Jean-S\u00e9bastien SILVESTRE is a cardiovascular physiologist.

BIOSKETCH TEAM LEADER Jean-S\u00e9bastien SILVESTRE, PhD - DR InsermTEAM 06 HIGHLIGHTS The current treatment of heart failure rests on 2 major pillars: drugs; and interventional, surgical, or cathe-ter-based procedures. These therapies are either palli-ative or, at the other extreme, radical (cardiac replace-ment). In the past 2 decades, an intermediate strategy has emerged that aims at repairing the diseased heart by transplanting cells. The phenotype of the \"ideal\" cells is still unsettled. However, there has been a recent shift toward cells committed to a cardiac lineage. We adopted an innovative strategy consisting of starting \"upstream\" from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and leveraging their intrinsic pluripotentiality to drive their fate toward a cardiovascular lineage. We tested the feasibility of leveraging the properties of hESCs to generate clinical-grade cardiovascular progenitor cells and assessed their safety in patients with severe isch-emic left ventricular dysfunction. Six patients received a median dose of 8.2 million hESC-derived cardiovas-cular progenitors embedded in a fibrin patch that was epicardially delivered during a coronary artery bypass procedure. The primary endpoint was safety at 1 year and focused on: 1) cardiac or off-target tumor, assessed by detected serial interrogations of the cardioverter-defibrillators implanted in all patients; and 3) alloimmunization, assessed by the presence of donor-specific antibodies. The protocol generated a highly population of cardiovascular progenitors. One patient died early post-operatively from treat-ment-unrelated comorbidities. All others had unevent-ful recoveries. The longest follow-up is now 6.5 years without adverse events that could be attributed to the procedure. In particular, no tumor was detected during follow-up, and none of the patients presented with arrhythmias. One patient developed clinically silent 56 57 PARCC - PARIS CARDIOVASCULAR RESEARCH CENTER ANNUAL REPORT 2019-2021 alloimmunization. All patients were symptomatically improved with an increased systolic motion of the cell-treated segments. One patient died of heart failure after 22 months. This trial demonstrates the technical feasibility of producing clinical-grade hESC-derived cardiovascular progenitors and supports their short- and medium-term safety, thereby setting the grounds for adequately powered efficacy studies (Menasch\u00e9 P et al, J Am Coll Cardiol, 2018). In parallel to the clinical trial, experimental studies pro-vided evidence that the alleged benefits of the cells were due to their ability to harness endogenous repair pathways and the recognition that this paracrine effect was largely mediated by extracellular vesicles has led us to focus on the exclusive use of these nanoparticles, keeping the same cell type for their ex vivo production but skipping direct cell transplantation (Correa BL et al, Cardiovasc Res, 2021 & Hamada T et al, Acta Biomater, 2020 & El Harane N et al, Eur Heart J, 2018).
