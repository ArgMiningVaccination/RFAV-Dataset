George It's an honor and pleasure to put a review for the Dr. Ronit Vilan My body has never felt better I feel mental clarity physical strength. Her caring and honest traits Make her and outstanding practitioner I whole family has had the pleasure of being adjusted and has felt immediate relief. Ilana Dr. Ronit Vilan is a kind, caring, effective chiropractor. I came to her due to serious back pain and within a relatively short period of time I no longer experience pain. I love walking into her office as it is clean, and attractive with a positive vibration. I recommend Dr. Vilan highly. Joan Dr. Ronit is an incredibly kind and professional care provider. She treats every patient with the upmost attention and concern. Taking time to have a 20 minute consultation with every patient she sees. I instantly felt welcome and at ease at my first time receiving chiropractic care. She walked me through every step of the process and explained why each step was necessary. The office is an oasis in Queens. It feels like a place you would want to go to relax. I felt welcome and safe in her office. Her staff is attentive and polite. They are extremely accommodating appointment requests. When I started treatment I could've never expected the amazing results that I got. I was having carpal tunnel in my right wrist for weeks wearing a brace to and from school. With being seen twice a week for one month the pain is completely gone and I haven't had to wear my brace at all. I am super grateful for Dr. Ronit. I'm feeling great and holding my adjustments for longer each time. I even drive one hour from the upper Eastside to Queens to see her. Let me tell you it's definitely worth the drive. KT Dr. Ronit is one of the most genuine people I've met. Very professional and courteous when dealing with myself and other patients. I appreciate how she takes the time to explain what each machine/excerise will do and what the benefits are. Lamont "}
