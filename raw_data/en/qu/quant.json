Contents: CONTENTS........................................................................................................................pg.6 THESIS STATEMENT......................................................................................................pg. architecture can heal\" - Michael MurphyThesis Statment: \"Holistic design for healthcare can enable architects to design space the serve as a catalyst for effective healing to take place.\"How can architecture heal? Architecture can heal in a variety of ways and moreover improve the lives of everyone in a community or the building being used by the occupants. Holistic styles of design can help designers achieve this. Preface: \"Architectural design, when employed as a means of embodying Holistic principles, can provide healing environments that di-rectly relate to our human body structure. Holistic Architecture is primarily associat-ed with treating the whole person through the built environment. It promotes pre-ventative medicine by maintaining the health of all aspects of the self\u2014physi-cal, mental, emotional, and spiritual. Buildings have a profound influence on our health, physiological, and energetic state of being. Harmony and balance, light and color, relationship to our surroundings, and green materials are all contributing elements of the built environment that aspire to be positive rather than nega-tive. By creating an atmosphere around us that is supportive to both our inner and outer senses, we can enhance rather than alienate our earthly links with nature. Holistic Architecture embraces the multi-faceted complexities of the built environment through sustainability, green design, ecologically-positive materials, and alternative modalities. Nature follows certain rhythms and principals. Nature expresses itself in a language of shapes, harmonic ratios and geometric patterns of positive energy. Incorporating these principles into a healthcare environment allows a full cir-cle approach to our genetic makeup. It makes sense that if our buildings are to support healing then they should have these principals as generative design paths. Everything in the Universe follows these geometric principals. These princi-pals can generate a foundation for build-ing composition. Imagine the building designed in such a way that the geometry is in proportion to the healing energies of our human body.\" -MBH Architectural Design The holistic health practitioners for centuries have researched and found many ways of healing that are unique to the traditional healing methods for the times in which they are in. They believe in the ancient idea that healing is most effective when you consider the whole person, rather than focusing on the specific illnesses, body parts or symptoms. As Socrates said in the 4th century B.C., \"the part can never be well unless the whole is well.\" Holistic health is best described as a state of balance, not simply an absence of illness. A holistic health education teaches the interconnection of mind, body, spirit and environment just has it has for thousands of years. Centuries before penicillin or x-ray machines, health providers recognized the impor-tance of emotional and spiritual well being in achieving physical health. Two of the most well documented ancient health traditions are Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda. TCM originated almost 5,000 years ago and has only evolved into a complex system of diagnostic and treatment methods that are still used today. From the very beginning, TCM viewed the human body as a small universe of inter-connected systems, including physical elements as well as subtle energies, such as life force or spirit. The three ancient medical traditions in holistic health are ayurveda, herb- al medicine, and western herbalism. Ayurveda which was discovered in India, traces its origins to a text in the 6th century B.C. The healing practice incorpo-rates beliefs in the first great elements of the universe. Practitioners tell their patients to exercise balance and moderation. Herbal medicine emphasizes holistic balance and is the oldest form of health care known. Many indigenous people all over the world and throughout history have drawn on medicinal prop-erties of plants. Herbalism became a critical element of TCM and Ayurveda. Fi-nally, western herbalism originated in ancient Greece and Rome, and then rap-idly spread throughout the rest of Europe and eventually to North and South America which focused on the medicinal attributes of plants and herbs. Back in the 4th century Hippocrates who is known as the \"father of medicine\", believed in the power of nature. He believed strongly in the self-healing efforts of the body. While others were actively stepping in to correct illness. These various approaches support versus intervention were debated for centuries until the scientific revolution occurred in the 19th century. After the discovery of germs as a cause for disease and illness, Western medicine became the focus for healing and health intervention. Sickness was destroyed with medi-cines and penicillin. Physicians began paying less attention to lifestyle choic-es and environmental factors. The focus was on symptoms and syndromes. When other diseases failed to respond to western methods people sought other forms of treatment. By the 1970s the National Conference on holistic health was conducted and American Holistic Health Association (AHHA) was formed. T oday, with all the great imbalance in the world in what we eat and breath we must come up with holistic ways of living to prevent illness. People are demanding alternatives to modern medicine to seek optimal personal wellness. This has sparked re-search in the medical industry in all facets.

Yeang's theory is that ecological architectural aesthetic should resemble a living system, looking natural, verdant and hirsute with nature and its processes visible in the bio-integration of the synthetic built-form's physical con-stituents. In essence ecological architecture should read and look like a living form and system that becomes its own ecosystem within the built environment. This de-mands a identifiable style, which can be a distinctive green vegetated Eco-aesthet-ic such as trees, bushes and other plants that begin to situate themselves within a building. This in turn not only gives the building life and brilliant aesthetics but also gives the occupants that use them a connection to nature and the ecological envi-ronment being formed. This concept sustainable concept should be replicated to achieve holistic design in healthcare. The ideas of ecology in architecture play with the ideas of biophillia by using the green sustainable concepts. This can give the patients, doctors and those that would use the healthcare facilities a more natural experience. The \"con-structed living organism\" can help human organisms that are seeking comfort in the healing process. WAYFINDING: Royal Liverpool University Hospital A single hub of public circulation at the center of the building includes lifts and a spine linking the north and south entrances to blocks of clini-cal space clustered around the hub at each level. This enables extremely short travel distances from the entrances to a central hub and through the use of glazing leads to simple \"line of sight\" way finding to all clinical destinations. Royal Liverpool University Hospital SUSTAINABILITY: Often overlooked in healthcare design sustainability can reduce e the per capita of the health care by reducing health care expenses; for example, spending less money on utilities enhances hospitals' ability to free up resources for patient care. Royal Liverpool University Hospital Location: Butaro, Rwanda Project Year: 2011Specialty: Small Community Hospital Client: Rwandan Ministry of Health; Partners in HealthSize: 65,000 sq. ft. CASE STUDY 1: Butaro Hospital Ruwanda MASS DESIGN GROUPPATIENT ROOMSMurphy tackled many challenges in health- care at the Butaro site. Many of these led to solutions that stopped the spread of common diseases. He said, \"If hallways are making people sicker than lets flip them inside out.\" A solution like this can even bring the patient closer to nature and help not just the body but the mind. This sort of design solution wouldn't have been possible if not for the use of evi-dence based design.Due to this effort by the design team they found that crowd-ed corridors and insufficient ventilation, patients and healthcare providers can be subjected to high risk of contracting airborne diseases inside health facilities, particularly in rural, impoverished settings. In addition to this, part of holistic design is building local, fabricating local. Use mate-rials that are in a close radius and fabricat-ed by people that live near the site. Holistic Design can even use the ideas of minimalism. This also can be achieved by a means building local and using local mate-rials. The scoop of the project included an effort to invigorate grassroots business and development. The construction was used with 100% local labor, and nearly 4,000 people were trained and hired to help excavate, con-struct, and manage the project. The con-struction teams were organized into six times as many people to be hired and be involved in the building process. All labor-ers of the project were provided food, wa-ter and healthcare. The bigger and greater impact though was that it provided the benefits to a \"third-world\" community of creating jobs and energizing community investment in the project. SECTIONSOne of the great hallmarks of the Butaro Hospital project is the local masonry that is used all through out the exterior cladding. Masonry capacity building and the two way learning happened nat- urally at all stages and areas of the project, from design workshops with the local builders on-site development of different types of construction methods. The stone used primarily was that of volca-nic stone is a typical element of the northern Rwandan landscape. It is normally thought of by many in the farming industry as a nuisance when they try to prepare their fields for the growing season. When it is used during construction it is typically only for founda- tions or courtyard walls. Additionally, it is often covered partially or completely we sought to minimize mortar, and create an even and nearly seamless expanse of deep gray porous walls. After going through multiple iterations the mason's of the project were eager about the product they were using and forged ahead with using the stone through the majority of the project. As the project progressed through the various buildings on the hospital campus, their work became more refined. Recognizing how their skill had advanced as they worked, the masons eventually offered to replace their initial work at no cost, out of a sense of pride. As the newly trained, highly skilled contractors, these masons are now sought after in other parts of the country by contractors seek-ing to replicate the great stone walls of Butaro. The final component to Murphy's project was the use of natural ventilation across the different patient rooms. As mentioned before, Butaro Hospital design uses a range of innovative features designed to minimize risk of infection. Eliminating interior corridors and installation of large-radius and louvered windows ensure frequent air exchange, key strategy in reducing transmission. The only way to produce the needed air changes in the ward, high-volume, low-speed fans with diameters of 24 feet were used at strategic points to move air from the wards out the louvers and open windows. By doing all of this potentially harmful microbes and bacterial is removed from the air. In addition to this, germicidal UV lights were installed to kill or inactivate microbes as air is drawn through the upper regions of the room. Finally, the use of a non-permeable, continuous floor finish provided a sur-face devoid of joints and prone to bacterial growth. The floor type is nor-mally easy to clean, durable and safe by resisting infection. It is clear through by employing an effective grassroots movement you can accomplish the goals of sustainability and therefore having a positive impact on the community we build in and provide an adequate patient ex-perience that can facilitate the holistic healing process. All of these lessons can be used building even in first world nations with top healthcare providers such as the United States. CROSS SECTIONLocation: Jurong, Singapore Project Year: 2015Specialty: Health CampusClient: Jurong 1.84 million sq. ft. CASE STUDY 2: Ng T eng Fong General Hospital HOK/Studio 505The facility provides seamless integration of care on a single site. Close management ensures integration at the hospitals' infrastruc-ture, administrative and clinical levels. The hospitals are designed to share service facilities such as digital imaging, pharmacy, catering, medical records, storage and training facilities.Sustainable design strategies create a facility that functions like a vertical healing garden. Based on the design team's client mandate to give \"every patient a window,\" the design brings plants, gardens and daylight into each patient's view. Controlled access to vegetation on terraces provides a therapeutic environment for healing. Oriented to reduce solar gain and capture prevailing breezes, the unique floor arrangement allows for double the amount of natural ventilation. The project also includes solar thermal hot water heating and a large photo-voltaic array. It has been rated Platinum under Singapore's Green Mark program. Often times though convincing hospital administrators who can become concerned with the bottom line sometimes will not go for paying such high upfront costs for a project like this. This, 1,100 bed hospital that includes over 700 acute care beds and 400 other types of beds has seen a reduction in energy use of 69% compared to the average hospital in the United States. In addition to this the hospital saw a 38% reduction in energy use compared to the average Sin-gaporean hospital. This all according to post construction research conducted by HOK. Another major source of costs often associated with large scale healthcare facilities such as Ng teng Fong is water. Due to the solar thermal concepts implemented in the project, the hot water heating provided is 100% from the solar thermal. This has drastically reduced the need for electrical costs. In addition to this the photovoltaic array or better known as solar panels generate 100 kWp. This has again helped dramatically with electrical costs. All of these methods are ways we has designers can convince fiscally sensitive administrators to go for our concepts. The design team as mentioned before wanted to employ a strategy that created an organic floor plan that allowed each patient to be apart of the vertical green walls and have a view of a window. This was done because research has shown through evidence based design that, patients heal faster when looking at a window during their stay. In addition to this the team designed with the intent of providing flexibility between medical functions and to withstand natural or human-caused disasters. The administration floor of the clinic could function as a clinical floor. The community hospital could function as an acute hospi-tal with limited HVAC changes. Another flexible feature is the single-bed hospital rooms can be adapted into wards with two or four beds, while the wards with six beds can double their capacity to 12. The modular clinics allow for specialty groups to flex up or down in size according to need. Operating rooms are universal, and clinical spaces have adjacent soft spaces that accommodate future change. The hospital also serves as ground zero emergency prepared-ness center and supports three component nodes. These are peacetime, national emergency and civil emergency. A complex labyrinth system prevents bio-terrrorist from accessing air han-dlers. The joint basement of the health centers is designed as a highly resilient bomb shelter that can withstand disasters and provide trauma care during emergencies. Finally, 82 percent of patient beds naturally ventilated and day lit, most of the facility could maintain basic functionality during a utility failure. Additional power demands would be supplied by the photovoltaics, solar thermal system and backup generators. Each of the rooms also incorporates fluid dynamics models, shading analysis, climate analysis, daylight modeling, acoustical studies, and energy modeling to develop the design to optimize energy efficiency and the patient experience. FLOOR PLAN CONCEPTSLocation: Boston, MA Project Year: 2011Specialty: T eaching Client: Harvard Medical SchoolSize: 530,00 sq. ft. CASE STUDY 3: Massachusetts General Hospital NBBJ\"Wayfinding\" Located in the heart of the MGH cam- pus, the Lunder Building plays a critical role in integrating teaching, research and patient care by connecting exist-ing buildings. NBBJ used circulation modeling to develop ideal connections for easy facility access, patient transport to other services on the campus and ma-terials flow. All this together creates effective wayfinding which is another important component to patient cen-tered design. Due to constrictive floor-to-floor ceil- ing heights within existing buildings, connections were limited to the five floors where pedestrian traffic and lo-gistical connections to existing build-ings were most critical. The loading dock and sterile depart- ment, on the first two levels, respec-tively, service the entire campus. Join-ing with the White and Ellison buildings below grade, these connections are critical for campus-wide materials dis-tribution. This critical role is important to facili- tate the role of teaching, research and patient care. It is this idea that helps enhance the patient experience by re-ducing stress for them as they arrive to any healthcare facility. Much of this wayfinding was coordinat- ed through the use of design team's run at several iterations that looked at the patient beds per floor while mini-mizing travel distances for staff. All of these connections create an efficient built environment that all can use with ease. BUILDING AXO CAMPUS CONNECTIONSURBAN SCALE PATIENT TOWER One of the goals for this project was to increase the number of beds and shift from double to single pa-tient rooms for infection prevention, privacy and a greater patient/family-centered care. The challenge was to make this work within the tower's square floor plate, without increasing travel distances for nurses and clinicians who work in close collaboration. Further research was shown quieter environments speed patient recovery. By combining design with changes in clinical practice, average noise levels on patient floors were measured at 46.5 deci-bels which was 35 % lower than the worldwide average of 72 decibels in comparable hospitals. The urban response was done by creating a exterior for the building that has a formal response to the horizon-tal and vertical nature of the adjacent buildings. This creates a visual language that fits with the surround-ing urban context. The massing of the building reflects the program within, where the five-story bed tower is visually separated from the procedural floors below. One of the great takeaways from the design phase of this project is the repetitive design phase for planning the floor plan layout. The design team sketched out numerous configurations that maximized the number of pa-tient beds per floor while minimizing travel distances for staff. Access to daylight throughout the tower was also a major design goal. This unique lay-out is what transformed an urban setting and made the patient feel like they were transported to a green forest and more importantly closer to nature. Location: Herning, Denmark Project Year: 2020 (est. completion)Specialty: Modern HospitalClient: DNV-GodstrupSize: 1.4 million sq. ft. CASE STUDY 4: DNV-Godstrup-Denmark Hospital AART-ArchitectsThe vision behind this case study project was to cre-ate a modern hospital that offers therapeutic and op-erational efficiency. The de-signers ensured an efficient work flow by creating close contact between wards and professional specialties. The patient in turn has short- er distances to diagnostic imaging, ambulant treatment among other things. In addition the hospital provides space for the doctor to come to the patient instead of vice versa. By optimizing the wayfind- ing, the project provides the framework for an efficient and dynamic hospital where the patient is at the cen-ter and services are easy to access around them. Using evidence based de- sign the hospital enhances the relation between inside and outside by integrating the green landscape . This relationship between green space and natural materials ignites all the senses and which then creates a more \"homely\" atmosphere in-stead of a traditional hospital. Biophilic DesignSustainability Another strong focus for this project is the need for sustainability. The lo- cal Agenda 21 Action Plan in 2011 is the common platform for work relat-ing to sustainable development in the Central Denmark region. The action plan paints a picture of the region's efforts with regard to effective action on sustainable development. This action will demand both cooperation and innovation in the coming years. Sustainability in this case will require low energy consumption and low environmental impact must therefore be an integral part of the planning of DNV-Godstrup. Part of this plan pictured on this spread is a irrigation system created through rainwater runoff that flows into the ground. This pond that will be created is becomes a scenic viewing area for patients, visitors and even employees. It also irrigates the vast green vegetations that will fill the entire plot of land for the site. A wind turbine has already been erected on the building site. It will pro- vide power for the site huts during the construction of the new hospi-tal, and paves the way for a major focus on green energy and innovative solutions that benefit the environment. Location: Koge, Denmark Project Year: 2021 (est completion) Specialty: University Hospital Client: Region SjaellandvSize: 1.9 million sq. ft.CASE STUDY 5: Koge University Hospital CF Moller and Gehl ArchitectsSustainable Planning Koge University Hospital (USK is an expansion of the existing Koge Hospital, which will be increased threefold to a total area of 1.9 million square feet. This innovative project in terms of both architecture and functionality expands upon the ideas of holistic design in a multitude of ways. The design is based on the already existing hospital's qualities and potential, and presents a cohesive sustainable, architec-tural, functional and technical vision of a clear, compact, green and inviting hospital complex. The hospital's various functions can be structured on a highly flexible ba-sis, with good opportunities to support Region Zealand's vision of holistic patient care or patient centered design. This expansion project in Koge, Denmark builds upon the ideas of Biophilic design. The existing lobby as the main thoroughfare has four vertical transit routes that emerge from this point. East route connects to a square with individual gardens, which make it easy to access for patients, relatives and employees. These green surroundings, ample natural light, courtyard gardens, green roofs and views are key elements of concept of health-promoting architecture expose those that use the healing spaces biophilic sensory. The hospital also uses its natural landscapes and geographic location to its advantage by overlooking the circular forest which sur-rounds the hospital, the lakes and even a river. The new wards all overlook these nat-ural features, therefore allowing the patients pleasing views that don't seem sterile.Koge Hospital is located in a striking, ring- formed forest area. It was originally design and landscaped by C.F. Moller in the 1980s and it comprises a low, densely built hospital com-plex with a single overall traffic system and pleasant and welcoming courtyard gardens and day rooms. The new Koge University Hospital builds upon the strong qualities currently existing and creates a modern, health--promoting and re-storative environment for patients, relatives and staff. The grounds of the hospital will be developed with landscapes areas, lakes and watercourses. All of the inpatient wards will overlook the countryside to the west or of the bay. The green surroundings, ample daylight, courtyard gardens, green roofs and views are key elements of the concept of healing archi-tecture. The new hospital will have a strong vertical core that connects all the floors and programs in a very effective way. This vertical opening will easily be seen inside and out through a glass facade and provide constant views to the complexes surrounding. Transitions The new hospital will have a strong vertical core with transport routes that lead to central squares, each with their own related courtyard gar-den area, making much easier to maneuver throughout the complex. With this new compactness there will be shorter distances for the staff to walk and visitors to transition. Location: San Carlos, CA Project Year: 2014Specialty: Outpatient Services Client: Palo Alto Medical FoundationSize: 190,00 sq. ft.CASE STUDY 6: San Carlos Center NBBJPractice Concepts The design of the Palo Alto Medical Founda- tion's San Carlos Center exhibits a holistic ap-proach to healthcare design that ensures the wellbeing of the end-user, community and the environment. Located on a prominent, reclaimed brownfield site, the San Carlos Center and the surrounding campus are designed to provide an entrance to the community. The project was originally planned as an integrated inpatient and outpa-tient healthcare facility, but was built as a two-phase development. Phase One is comprised of a four-level outpa- tient clinic, administrative offices, an ambulato-ry surgery center and a four-level parking struc-ture. The facility utilizes distinctive architectural features based on the regional mission style to enhance its visibility, while providing a space for medical clinics and offices, outpatient sur-gery, intervention services, and support ser-vices. The second phase, an inpatient hospital, remains part of PAMF's future growth plans for the location. NBBJ created wonderful transition spaces that can invite the environmental breaks patients and staff need from the difficult day to day re-alities of a hospital. In this case study we can begin to imagine a space that can serve as a typical ward concept that allows natural light into the space. This typical layout we see in common wards can face large windows that now bring the outside in. This is a similar concept we saw Michael Mur-phy execute in his various medical facilitates. Using the sun shading device with a leaf pat- tern installed we can feel the wonders of nature inside the hospital and in places such as a ward. In this concept exercise using natural materials can further the ideas of holistic design and a human connection to nature. Using more ma-terials such as wood, stone and light materials these spaces can now invite nature into the healing spaces. This concept of natural light and sustainable materials can be replicated in other healthcare spaces such as emergancey departments, op-erating rooms, waiting rooms and other transi-tion spaces. Through further investiga- tion of this case study, I began to look at Emergency Department Concepts that could incorporate holistic ideas of materiality and take advantage of the vertical healing garden. Through this we can begin to achieve that attachment to nature that is so important in designing these types of healthcare facilities that would put the patient first. Through this exercise I used ideas of wood, green colors from nature, stone and bamboo. These materials were add-ed on the walls, floor and in some cases on both areas. These material studies can be helpful in finding several concepts which are aids in visualizing ways of holistic design and healing. In this case seeing how light re-flects off of stone, wood or other materials found in nature we can see what will work best with the patient experience. T o build on the concepts materiality and connection to nature I took the existing space and did a series of it- erations that show how applying materials such as wood, bamboo, stone, green texture and even sun shad-ing can elevate a space to better levels of holistic design. In addition to this visualizing a space that takes advantage of corner windows which can allow more natural light into the space. It is also important to visual-ize how we can not just accommodate the patient's needs but also the visiting family members, after all one of the major parts of this project and holistic design itself is the idea of patient and family centered care. Finally, we can utilize the outdoor space in nature by brining it into the room using sun shading devices along the window. Creating a leaf like pattern on the shading device, sunlight will cast the shadows onto the pa-tient throughout the day giving them a greater connection to nature and playing on the ideas of biophillia. Final Design ConceptSite Analysis The city of T ampa is one that is under major redevelopment over the coming decade. Between now and the year 2030 the de-velopment \"Water Street\" will un-dergo a $3 billion mega develop-ment. Led by Bill Gates and T ampa Bay Lightening owner Jeff Venik the skyline will be transformed into a new downtown footprint that will led the city for the de-cades to come. The downtown itself will double in size due to the project. By finally redeveloping abandoned parcels of land that has been hardly used over the past decade the city will gain ser-vices to enhance the downtown experience. Overall, the future 53-acre mixed-use project will cover up to 9 million square feet with 18 distinct buildings directly on the river and channelside district. The new buildings include new hotels, retail, office space, cultural ame-nities, modern residences, ad-ditional parking and a new green infrastructure. This new green in-frastructure will include more pe-destrian walkways, an extension of the T ampa Riverwalk and new park spaces. Within this 53-acre redevelop- ment will be where the Univer-sity of South Florida's Morsani College of Medicine and Heart Institute will be. This is the site I have chosen from my new Green Hospital that incorporates the ideas looked at and discussed previously in this book. With the new site development occurring around the site and landscaping improvements this project which includes elements of biophillia and ecology can contribute to the urban fabric and help lead the T ampa redevelopment to suc-cess. The projects location adjacent to the new green sites and the wa-ter allow for this site to be advan-tageous for the success of our healthcare project. These parks next to our site will lend great ac-cess for those that come to visit the site and the water views for the patients that will have con-sistent views.
